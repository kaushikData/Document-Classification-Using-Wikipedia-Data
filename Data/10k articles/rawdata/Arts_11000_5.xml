{{Year nav topic5|1700|music}}

The year '''1700 in music''' involved some significant events.  Much of the music in the 1700s America originated from places such as England, Ireland, Italy, France, and Africa.  Much of the music in this time period were ballads, folk songs, drum signals, and psalms.  Many songs were used as theater songs, recruiting songs, military marches, and even some dance music.  Around this time was when the piano started becoming more and more popular.  Violins, fiddles, and flutes were among the most played and most known instruments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.colonialmusic.org/colonial-music-resources/essays/about-early-american-music.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Many of the most famous composers in classical music history have come out of the 18th century time period.  These include men such as Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Bach Johann Sebastian.  Mozart is considered the "greatest musical genius of all time."  In his lifetime he has been a part of forty-one symphonies, twenty-five string quartets, and nineteen masses.  This was only a fraction of the work he has done.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history1700s.com/index.php/articles/25-society-and-culture/9-18th-century-composers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''The Spinning Image'' wrote, "it was regarded at the time as a glossy exercise in marrying cinema advert visuals to a would-be daring plot about unmarried motherhood, some way away from the nineteen-sixties "issue" films and TV plays that offered audiences and commentators alike something to get their teeth into. ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' or ''[[Up the Junction (film)|Up the Junction]]'' this was not. All that said, and those naysayers did have a point, funnily enough this has aged rather better than might have been expected since it conforms to the [[Swinging Sixties]] stereotype fairly comfortably; though it remained a shade artificial as an experience as a nostalgia piece it came across very well, and much of that was down to the central relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespinningimage.co.uk/cultfilms/displaycultfilm.asp?reviewid=9398&amp;aff=13|title=Nice Girl Like Me, A Review (1969)|website=www.thespinningimage.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Afterimage: The Journal of Media Arts and Cultural Criticism''''' is a bimonthly journal of contemporary art, culture, and politics. It publishes features, essays, local and international reportage, exhibition reviews, and book reviews with an emphasis on [[social dialogue]], politically engaged artistic practices, and the role of the artist as [[cultural critic]] and [[curator]].

The journal is published by the [[Visual Studies Workshop]], a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], [[artist-run space|artist-run]], education center for [[photography]] and other [[media arts]] based in [[Rochester, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Abrash|title=Mediating History: The Map Guide to Independent Video by and About African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino, and Native American People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F90TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127|accessdate=February 28, 2016|date=August 1, 1992|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-0620-6|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Afterimage'' was founded in 1972 by photographer and curator [[Nathan Lyons]], who had previously served as assistant director and chief curator of the international museum of photography known as [[George Eastman House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Art, Activism, and Oppositionality: Essays from Afterimage |last=Kester |first=Grant H. |year=1998 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, North Carolina |isbn=978-0-8223-2081-4 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eu5cm9iuewC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its inaugural issue, the magazine aimed to pose "a challenge to existing centres of practice and education" as well as "to [[institutional hierarchy|institutional hierarchies]], widening the remit of art criticism and theoretical debate and engaging directly with context, community and issues of [[accountability]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 5, 2012|url=http://www.variant.org.uk/8texts/Ann_Vance.html|title= Review of Art Activism and Oppositionality: Essays From Afterimage|work=Variant|publisher=Variant |first=Ann  |last=Vance |date=Summer 1999|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former ''Afterimage'' editor Grant H. Kester described the ethos of the magazine in terms of two primary modes of resistance:

* "an attempt to contest the then dominant tendency to view art photography as a form of pure expression that must remain uncontaminated by more mundane or quotidian uses of the medium"&lt;ref name=artc&gt;{{cite book |title=Art, Activism, and Oppositionality: Essays from Afterimage |last=Kester |first=Grant H. |year=1998 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, North Carolina |isbn=978-0-8223-2081-4 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eu5cm9iuewC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "a desire to break down the division between the practicing artist and the historian or critic, resulting in new hybrid figures such as the 'artist/curator' or the 'artist/critic'"&lt;ref name=artc/&gt;

==Contributors==
The journal's list of contributors has included notable artists such as [[Coco Fusco]] and [[Martha Rosler]].

==Career==
Nair was working as the creative director of an advertising agency in [[Bangalore]] when she wrote her first book, a collection of short stories called ''Satyr of the Subway'', which she sold to Har-Anand Press. The book won her a fellowship from the [[Virginia Center for the Creative Arts]].

Nair's second book was published by [http://www.penguinbooksindia.com/Authordetail.aspx?AuthID=17 Penguin India], and was the first book by an Indian author to be published by [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]] USA. A bestselling author of fiction and poetry, Nair's novels [[The Better Man]] and ''[[Ladies Coupé|Ladies Coupe]]'' have been translated into 21 languages. Among Nair's early commercial works were pieces she penned in the late 90's for The Bangalore Monthly magazine (now called [http://www.080mag.com "080" Magazine]), published by [[Explocity]] in a column titled 'The Economical Epicurean'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://connect.in.com/anita-nair/biography21743.html Anita Nair Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="culturebase1"&gt;{{cite web|author=culturebase.net |url=http://www.culturebase.net/artist.php?1354 |title=Anita Nair artist portrait |publisher=culturebase.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter followed Nair's novel [[The Better Man]] (2000) which also has been published in Europe and the United States. In 2002, appeared the collection of poems ''Malabar Mind'', and in 2003 ''Where the Rain is Born - Writings about Kerala'' which she has edited. Anita Nair's second novel ''Ladies Coupé'' from 2001, has turned out to be an even greater success than the first both among critics and readers in so far 15 countries outside India: from the United States to [[Turkey]], from Poland to Portugal.

In 2002, "Ladies Coupé" was elected as one of the five best in India. The novel is about women's conditions in a male dominated society, told with great insight, solidarity and humour.&lt;ref name="culturebase1"/&gt; ''Ladies Coupe'' (2001) was rated as one of 2002's top five books of the year and was translated into more than twenty-five languages around the world.

Nair has also written ''The Puffin Book of Myths and Legends'' (2004), a children's book on myths and legends. Nair has also edited ''Where the Rain is Born'' (2003). Nair's writings about Kerala and her poetry has been included in ''The Poetry India Collection'' and a [[British Council]] Poetry Workshop Anthology. Her poems appeared in many prestigious poetry anthologies like ''[[The Dance of the Peacock]]: An Anthology of English Poetry from India'',&lt;ref name=brook&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grove|first1=Richard|title=The Dance of the Peacock:An Anthology of English Poetry from India|url=http://hiddenbrookpress.com/Book-Indo-EnglishPoetry.html|accessdate=5 January 2015|issue=current|publisher=Hidden Brook Press, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring 151 Indian English poets, edited by Vivekanand Jha and published by Hidden Brook Press, Canada.&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite web|last1=Press|first1=Hidden Brook|title=Hidden Brook Press|url=http://hiddenbrookpress.com|publisher=Hidden Brook Press|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nair's works also include many travelogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageinindia.com/oct2009/chandradissertation.html |title=Language in India |publisher=Language in India |date=2009-10-10 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the play ''Nine Faces of Being'', best-selling author Anita Nair has become a playwright.

'''''Art Ninja''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Children's television series|children's]] television [[art]]-[[sitcom]] hybrid hosted by Ricky Martin. The show is produced by Dot to Dot Productions for [[CBBC]] and began on 17 January 2015.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://store.bbc.com/art-ninja/series-1|title=BBC Store|date=10 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series follows presenter Ricky and his life where he makes arts with his friends Rich Thorne, [[Michelle Ackerley]], Gavin "Gav" Strange and Sarah Matthews. Ella Lia Trudgeon and Ricky's dad, Terry Martin also appears in some episodes. Three series of 10 episodes each have been aired. Short compilation episodes are as ''Nine Minute Ninja''.

A fifth series was commissioned by CBBC in Spring 2018, which will air in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://kidscreen.com/2018/07/10/cbbc-jumps-on-more-art-ninja/&lt;/ref&gt;



==Format==
Each episode follows a [[sitcom]] format with instructional art segments, like ''[[Art Attack]]'' or ''[[SMart]]''. Each episode's makes has a theme to them, such as animals or aliens. An episode will usually consist of several small makes the viewer is able to make at home, an animation, a small drawing on a [[post-it note]], a make made with a viewer on [[Skype]], a small make with the character ''The Grandmaster'' and a big make (in the way of [[Art Attack]]), usually using a large amount of a certain material, like coins or clingfilm.

==Production==
''Art Ninja'' came around after Ricky Martin's pilot, ''Ricky's Radical Reinventions'' was not picked up by CBBC. Dot to Dot Productions were looking for a recommission of their former art series, ''Totally Rubbish''. However, CBBC's commissioner Cheryl Taylor wanted to create a new art brand. According to Martin, the series was aiming to be "''[[The Naked Chef]]'', meets art, meets ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]''. The working title for the series was ''Art Monkey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativebloq.com/art-direction/aardman-designer-encourages-kids-get-creative-art-tv-show-21514202|title=Aardman designer encourages kids to get creative in art TV show|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beyond Selflessness: Reading Nietzsche's Genealogy''''' is a philosophical examination of the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' (1887). The monograph was released by [[Christopher Janaway]] in 2007 as part of his series examining the work of Nietzsche.&lt;ref name="amazon1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Selflessness: Reading Nietzsche's Genealogy: Amazon.co.uk: Christopher Janaway: Books |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |id= {{ASIN|019957085X|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

{{Empty section|date=May 2014}}

==Critical reception==
Paul Bishop believed Janaway dealt well with the [[Nazism]] roots present in Nietzsche's philosophy, although this as a premise to his work is often debated.&lt;ref&gt;http://nietzschecircle.com/Pdf/Beyondselflessness.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Katsafanas believed that: 'It is an exceptionally clear work, full of valuable insights, helpful reconstructions of arguments, and intriguing readings of some of Nietzsche’s most important claims.' Katsafanas did raise some issues on the intrinsic details of Janaway's claims, including the tension between self-affirmation and self-satisfaction, although concluded: 'Although I have expressed concerns about the details of some of Janaway’s arguments, the book as a whole is exceptionally rewarding'.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.bu.edu/pkatsa/janawayreview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Big in Japan''' is an expression historically used to describe western based musical groups who achieve success in [[Japan]] but not necessarily in other parts of the world.

==Original usage==
The phrase began to appear on several major Japanese foreign-rock magazines, especially the ''Music Life'' magazine, in the late 1970s, and in most cases, the "big in Japan" artists became popular in Japan due to being featured by ''Music Life''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The concept predated the phrase; [[Neil Sedaka]] made it big in Japan with "[[One Way Ticket (Neil Sedaka song)|One Way Ticket]]" before breaking through in his native United States, while [[Jimmy Osmond]], typically a side show to his older brothers [[The Osmonds]] in North America and Europe, cut several tracks in Japanese and received several gold records for his recordings.

In the late 20th century, notable "big in Japan" artists included several [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] bands from the [[United States]], [[Heavy metal music|metal]] artists from Northern European countries such as [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], and especially [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] (e.g. the rock band [[Hanoi Rocks]]), [[eurobeat]] artists from [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and especially [[Italy]], and UK rock&lt;ref&gt;The term "UK rock" is an only-in-Japan term used for every [[rock music]] artist from the United Kingdom.[http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/rockmusic/subject/msub_uk01.htm UK rock / Britpop] [[About.com|All About]] {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; artists.

Some bands have used their popularity in Japan as a springboard to break into other audiences. Notably, the [[power pop]] group [[Cheap Trick]], which had been known as the "American Beatles" in Japan for their appeal, achieved widespread success with their [[multi-platinum]] [[live album]] ''[[Cheap Trick at Budokan]]''. The band had previously struggled to break into the mainstream American market with their earlier albums. Furthermore, like Cheap Trick, some bands have lost their "big in Japan" titles after gaining popularity in their respective homelands. The most notable example is [[Bon Jovi]].&lt;ref name="ongen"/&gt;

For example, [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] initially had only mediocre success in Europe and the United States,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} yet were "Big in Japan", as evidenced by their 1978 tour of the country and the double live album ''[[Tokyo Tapes (album)|Tokyo Tapes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haEfq-nKqjgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA3-IA216&amp;dq=big+in+Japan+scorn&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a | title=The Rough Guide to Rock |author1=Peter Buckley |author2=Jonathan Buckley | year=2003 }} Rough Guides. {{ISBN|1-84353-105-4}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84353-105-0}}. p. 909&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[The Ventures]], a band formed in 1959 and touring Japan each year since 1965, having logged over 2,000 concerts there by 2006.&lt;ref name=Homan&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NK9JF-_K4QC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=big+in+Japan+scorn&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA153,M1 | title=Access All Eras: Tribute Bands and Global Pop Culture | author=Shane Homan | year=2006 }} McGraw-Hill International. {{ISBN|0-335-21690-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-335-21690-1}}. pp. 152-154&lt;/ref&gt; "Being 'Big in Japan' turned into a positive sign of their closeness to the hearts of Japanese people, with the band embedded in national and local rock cultures."&lt;ref name=Homan/&gt;

Swedish band [[The Spotnicks]] toured Japan in 1966 after their song "Karelia" topped the Japanese charts the year prior, with hardly any promotion of the band. Around this time, the band's popularity in Europe had been waning due to changed taste in music, particularly in their home country where they had relatively few hits, none of them topping the charts. They went on a few more tours there in the late '60s and occasionally toured there in the '70s, '80s and for the last time in 1998. While their popularity in Japan is small compared to the one of The Ventures, "Karelia" is considered a classic song.

The phrase was used as the name of [[Big in Japan (band)|a UK punk band]] active from 1977 to 1982 (whose name inspired the title of [[Big in Japan (Alphaville song)|a 1984 hit single]] by [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Alphaville (band)|Alphaville]]) and was the name of the lead track on the Grammy-winning 1999 album ''[[Mule Variations]]'' by [[Tom Waits]]. The [[mockumentary]] ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]'' parodies this phenomenon when the band schedules a Japanese tour after discovering that their single "Sex Farm" is inexplicably selling very well there.

American band Mountain reformed for a successful tour of Japan in 1973. A live album titled ''Twin Peaks'' was released in 1974. Mountain bass player and vocalist Felix Pappalardi then worked with the Japanese band Creation in 1976.

==Other usage==
It has also been used in sports, for instance, to describe [[Major League Baseball]] players who join Japanese clubs at the end of their careers, such as [[Daryl Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nROWw0tk_8YC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=big+in+Japan |author1=Matt Johanson |author2=Wylie Wong |author3=Jon Miller | title=San Francisco Giants: Where Have You Gone? | year=2007|publisher= Sports Publishing LLC|page=1| ISBN=1-59670-187-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59670-187-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Small in Japan"==
The derivative phrase "small in Japan", originally used for [[AC/DC]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000059190 Barks : AC/DC visits Japan, after 9 years silence] Retrieved 2010-07-14 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been used since the early 1980s. In general, a small-in-Japan artist holds significant popularity in the Western world (in most cases the United States), and visits Japan many times to promote himself/herself, yet is almost unknown and unsuccessful in Japan despite being heavily featured by Japanese music media.

In Japanese culture, the phrase "small in Japan" is also used to describe Japanese celebrities who are unknown, unsuccessful or "forgotten" in Japan but making their ways outside Japan. The phrase has been used to refer to certain musicians such as [[Dir En Grey]], certain [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestlers]] such as [[Yoshihiro Tajiri]] and [[Yoshi Tatsu|Yoshitatsu]], certain [[fashion model]]s such as [[Ai Tominaga]] and [[Tao Okamoto]], and all the [[Miss Universe]] contestants from Japan, most of whom are former unsuccessful fashion models, including [[Kurara Chibana]] and [[Riyo Mori]].&lt;ref name="aj"&gt;[http://artisticjam.com/webtool/imanohito/?query=%E3%83%93%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A3%E3%83%91%E3%83%B3 Artistic Jam : "Big in Japan"] Retrieved 2010-07-14 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one exceptional case, ''Digital Arts'' magazine has used the phrase to describe the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], a [[video game console]] that was a success all over the world except in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=1804&amp;page=3&amp;pagepos=9 Xbox sales 'small in Japan'] Retrieved 2007-07-11&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''choirboy''' is a [[boy]] member of a [[choir]], also known as a treble.

As a derisive [[slang]] term, it refers to a do-gooder or someone who is morally upright, in the same sense that "[[Boy Scout]]" (also derisively) refers to someone who is considered honorable or conscientious.

== History ==
The use of choirboys in Christian [[Liturgy|liturgical]] music can be traced back to pre-Christian times. [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'s dictum that "women should be silent in churches" (''mulieres in ecclesiis taceant'') resonated with this largely patriarchal tradition; the development of vocal [[polyphony]] from the Middle Ages through the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] thus took place largely, though not exclusively, in the context of the all-male choir, in which all voice parts were sung by men and boys.

The first known usage in print of the term "choirboy" (rather than the earlier "singing boy") was by the Victorian novelist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] (1811–1863) in Chapter Vii of his story ''The Ravenswing'', published in ''Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country'' (London, Sept. 1843, XXVIII/165, p.&amp;nbsp;321): "He had been a choir-boy at Windsor".

In more recent years as girls have begun joining formerly all-male choirs, the gender-neutral term ''chorister'' is more often being used instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofchoristers.net Ofchoristers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923150850/http://www.ofchoristers.net/ |date=2006-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Until the late 20th century ''chorister'' was sometimes applied to adult choral singers too, but is now limited to children.)

== Becoming a chorister ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2008}}
Boys are generally eligible to join a choir at the age of seven. Voice trials are part of the selection process for larger choirs and tend to measure the quality of voice and pitch recognition rather than singing experience. Boys that are accepted into a choir begin as probationers.

Extensive musical training is provided, in particular for cathedral choristers. A number of famous composers and musicians began their careers as choristers. In 1740, [[Joseph Haydn]] was sent at the age of eight to Vienna to become a choirboy at [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|Saint Stephen's Cathedral]]. [[Franz Schubert]] was accepted into the choir of the Imperial Court Chapel in 1808 when he was 11. [[Dudley Moore]] became a choirboy at six.

A small bursary is paid to the boys each term, and opportunities arise for other bonuses during the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boychoirs.org/library/history/hist001.html Wells Cathedral Rules for Choristers, 1460]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choristers of the Year ==
The [[Royal School of Church Music]] (RSCM) organized the first UK competition for '''Choirboy of the Year''' in 1975. It was sponsored by Rediffusion and received more than 2,500 entries. The final, which took place in [[St George's, Hanover Square]], [[London]], was won by Matthew Billsborough. He sang the [[Matthäuspassion|St. Matthew Passion]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]. The last ever RSCM national competition was held in 1992, and was won by Gavin Moralee (now known as Gavin Cranmer-Moralee).  He sang [[The Monk and his Cat]] by [[Samuel Barber]] and [[How Beautiful are the feet]] from [[Handel's Messiah]].

The competition was open only to boy choristers up until 1986 when the [[BBC]] first organized an additional separate competition for girl choristers through the age of 16. The two competitions ran side-by-side for three years before the RSCM competition began including girls in its own competitions, naming both a choirboy and choirgirl of the year. From 1989 to 1992, both the BBC and RSCM named a different girl as Choirgirl of the Year.

In 1998, [[BBC Radio 2]] began hosting a combined boys and girls competition, without any other simultaneous competitions. James Fox, from St. Mary's Warwick, was named '''Choirboy of the Year''' and Eloise Irving, from West Sussex, was named '''Choirgirl of the Year'''. The format has remained the same through the most recent competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Boy Choir &amp; Soloist Directory - Young Choristers of the Year |url= http://www.boysoloist.com/boysoprano-coty.asp |accessdate= 2008-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time that can be called contemporary in [[Turkish literature]] falls in the period between the middle of the 20th century and the first years of the new millennium. Throughout this period many changes in literary discourse have occurred. Together with the fall of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and foundation of the [[Turkish Republic]] brought a different way to Turkish literature together with the effect of [[Westernization]] on Turkish writers. The literature of the new republic emerged largely from the pre-independence National Literature movement, with its roots simultaneously in the Turkish folk tradition and in the Western notion of progress. One important change to Turkish literature was enacted in 1928, when Mustafa Kemal initiated the creation and dissemination of a modified version of the [[Latin alphabet]] to replace the Arabic-based Ottoman script. Over time, this change—together with changes in [[Turkey]]'s system of [[education]]— would lead to more widespread [[literacy]] in the country. In 1950s, Turkish authors started to write in the tone of their western contemporaries bringing a new sense of literature to the country.

All of the salient aspects of Turkish life, politics and culture have found their direct or indirect expression in poetry, fiction, and drama, as well as in critical and scholarly writing. The themes and concerns have included nationalism, social justice, search for modernity. Westernization, revival of folk culture, economic and technological progress, human dignity, mysticism, pluralistic society, human rights and fundamental freedoms, democratic ideals, Ataturkism, Turanism, Marxist-Lenist ideology, revival of Islam, humanism in fact all aspect and components of contemporary culture found a voice in literature.

All stages of modern Turkish history (reforms under Atatürk, 1923–38; consolidation under Inonu, 1938–59; democracy under Menderes, 1950–60) have been marked by the thrust of literary modernization. Since the mid-nineteenth century, the most vital debate of Turkish literature has been between the proponents of art for art's sake and the advocates of commitment to realism and social causes. Mustafa Kemal in a conversation that took place in 1921, about two years before he proclaimed the Republic, exhorted the 19 years old Nazim Hikmet, already a famous poet, who would soon embrace the communist ideology and influence the course of modern Turkish literature, particularly poetry, more profoundly than anyone else. Since 1950, there has been a massive output, in all genres, depicting the plight of the lumpen proletariat. But surrealism, neosymbolism, theater of the absurd, stream of consciousness, hermeticism, black comedy and so on have also flourished.

==History==
In 1923, when the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed, the influential social thinker [[Ziya Gokalp|Ziya Gökalp]] wrote: "We belong to Turkish nation, the Islamic community, and Western civilization... Our literature must go the people and, at the same time, towards the West." The literature of the Turkish Republic has achieved Gokalp's objective.

Revolution, innovation, and Westernization have been driving forces of the Turkish nation in the twentieth century. The 19th century men of letters inherited the classical and the folk traditions but turned their attention to the literary tastes and movements of the West- particularly of France and England. The Ottoman state embarked upon process of transformation usually referred to as 'Westernization'.

==Major authors==

Contemporary Turkish Literature consists of many prolific authors whose works both shaped and improved the overall picture of Turkish literature. [[Mehmet Akif Ersoy]], a master of heroic diction, a major figure in early modern Turkish literature, devoted much of his verse to the dogma, and passion. His nationalism has a strong Islamic content, evident in the lyrics of the Turkish national anthem that he wrote. Yahya Kemal Beyatli was the much-acclaimed neoclassicist who produced, in the conventional forms and meters, meticulous lyrics of love, Ottoman grandeur, and Istanbul's natural attractions. Among the dedicated revolutionaries in 20th-century Turkish poetry Nazim Hikmet ranks the highest. He has been a modernizing force since the early 1920s, remaining significant in aesthetics and political terms. A communist, he spent many years in Turkish jails, fled to Soviet Union in 1951 and died in Moscow in 1963. Much of his works laments social injustice, complains of the oppression of the masses, and yearns for revolutionary change. In the mid-1950s a brave new genre emerged  the 'Village novel' which reached its apogee with [[Yasar Kemal]]'s ''Ince Memed'' (English title ''[[Memed, My Hawk]]''; this novel has been translated into 25 languages). He was considered the most famous Turkish novelist not only in turkey but also in the world press and literary circles. Satirical fiction is dominated by [[Aziz Nesin]], Turkey's best satirist ever. He is one of the most important figures of Turkish literature. He is the author of more than 100 books including poetry and prose.In more than 60 works, Nesin has provided strong indictment of the oppression and brutalization of the common man. A thrust for modernization took place in the early 1940s when Orhan Veli Kanik, Oktay Rifat, and Melih Cevdet Anday launched their poetic realism. Their urge for upheaval was revolutionary. A new generation had initiated obscurantism, continuing from where Asaf Haler Celebi's surrealism had left off in the 1940s. [[Ilhan Berk]] perhaps Turkey's most daring and durable poetic innovator, who acted as spokesman for the group (often identified as the Second New) pontificated "Art is for innovation's sake." The forms and values of classical poetry, too, are kept alive by a group of highly accomplished formalists who are clustered mainly around the monthly  ''Hisar'' which ceased publishing at the end of 1980 after 30 years.  His works have been translated into over thirty languages. [[Enis Batur]] is another important writer/poet in contemporary Turkish literature. He writes both in Turkish and in English. Some of his works are translated into English by Turkish translators. [[Orhan Pamuk]] is probably the best-known Turkish writer around the world mostly because of the [[Nobel Prize]] he won in 2006. He is considered one of the most prominent novelists of Turkey.

Paul Getty Trust |date= |accessdate=2018-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is famous for being the first known maker of decorated mold-blown glass, and for the exquisite quality of his work.&lt;ref name="Review"/&gt;

Ennion [[brand]]ed his work by signing them.&lt;ref name="Review"/&gt;

==Biography==
Ennion probably lived and worked in the city of [[Sidon]], in [[Phoenice (Roman_province)#Administrative history|Roman Phoenicia]] and today's [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="Review"/&gt; Although his name was [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] in origin, he signed his work in Greek, the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[eastern Mediterranean]] in his time.&lt;ref name="Getty"/&gt; He is thought to have been a [[Phoenicia]]n, and some scholars believe that later in life, with growing fame and demand, he moved to the north Italian city of [[Aquileia]], closer to [[Rome]] and its markets.&lt;ref name="Review"/&gt;

==Mold-blown glass==
Ennion is the first known maker (and/or workshop owner&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, July 18-19, 2015, page C13, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-wine-jug-thats-fit-for-a-roman-feast-or-a-brooklyn-banquet-1437162530  A Wine Jug That's Fit for a Roman Feast or a Brooklyn Banquet]&lt;/ref&gt;) of decorated mold-blown glass, a technique based on blowing bubbles of molten glass into molds.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite news |last= Johnson |first= Ken |title= Review: ‘Ennion,’ at the Met, Profiles an Ancient Glassmaker |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/arts/design/review-ennion-at-the-met-profiles-an-ancient-glassmaker.html |accessdate= 26 March 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was renowned for producing multi-panelled mold-blown glass vessels that were complex in their shapes, arrangement and decorative motifs.&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;Price, J.

''Five Thousand Years of Glass''. pp. 62–97. British Museum Press: London {{ISBN|0-8122-1888-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of designs of these mold-blown glass vessels illustrated the sophistication of the glassworkers in the eastern regions of the Roman Empire. Mold-blown glass vessels manufactured by the workshops of Ennion and other contemporary glassworkers such as Jason, Nikon, Aristeas, and Meges, constitutes some of the earliest evidence of glassblowing found in the eastern territories.&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horicht"&gt;Höricht, L.A.S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10690">[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|200px|''Europa regina'' in [[Sebastian Münster]]'s "''[[Cosmographia (Sebastian Münster)|Cosmographia]]''".]]
'''Europa regina''', [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Queen Europe'', is the [[map]]-like depiction of the [[Europe|European continent]] as a queen.&lt;ref name=Landwehr279&gt;Landwehr &amp; Stockhorst (2004), p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner (2009), p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Made popular in the 1500s, the map shows Europe standing upright, with the [[Iberian Peninsula]] forming her [[Hoop crown|crowned head]], and Bohemia her heart.

==Origins==
During the European [[Middle Ages]], maps typically adhered to the [[Jerusalem]]-centered [[T and O map|T-O scheme]], depicting Europe, [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=Borgolte16&gt;Borgolte (2001), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Separate maps of Europe were extremely rare; the only known examples are a map from [[Lambert of Saint-Omer]]'s [[Liber Floridus]], published in 1112, and a 14th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] map.&lt;ref name=Borgolte16/&gt; The next Europe-focussed map was published by cartographer Johannes Putsch in 1537, at the beginning of the [[Early Modern Age]].&lt;ref name=Borgolte16/&gt;

The Putsch-map was the first to depict Europe as an ''Europa regina'',&lt;ref name=BennholdtThomsen22&gt;Bennholdt-Thomsen (1999), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Borgolte16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmale244&gt;Schmale (2004), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; with the European regions forming a female human shape with [[Imperial crown|crown]], [[sceptre]] and [[globus cruciger]].&lt;ref name=Borgolte16/&gt; The map was first printed by [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] Christian Wechel.&lt;ref name=Wendehorst63&gt;Wendehorst &amp; Westphal (2006), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Though much about the origination and initial perception of this map is uncertain,&lt;ref name=Schmale244/&gt; it is known that Putsch (whose name was [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] as Johannes Bucius Aenicola, 1516-1542)&lt;ref name=Wendehorst63/&gt; maintained close relations with [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]],&lt;ref name=Schmale244/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wendehorst63/&gt; and that the map's popularity increased significantly during the second half of the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Schmale244/&gt; The modern term ''Europa regina'' was not yet used by Putsch's contemporaries, who instead used the Latin phrase ''Europa in forma virginis'' ("Europe in the shape of a maiden").&lt;ref name=Wendehorst63/&gt;

In 1587, [[Jan Bußemaker]] published a copper [[engraving]] by [[Matthias Quad]], showing an adaptation of Putsch's ''Europa regina'', as "''Europae descriptio''".&lt;ref name=Schmale244/&gt; Since 1588,&lt;ref name=Schmale244/&gt; another adaption was included in all subsequent editions of [[Sebastian Münster]]'s "''[[Cosmographia (Sebastian Münster)|Cosmographia]]''",&lt;ref name=Borgolte16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmale244/&gt; earlier editions had it only sometimes included.&lt;ref name=Wendehorst63/&gt; [[Heinrich Bünting]]'s "''Itenerarium sacrae scripturae''", which had a map of Europe with female features included in its 1582 edition, switched to ''Europa regina'' in its 1589 edition.&lt;ref name=Schmale244/&gt; Based on these and other examples, the year 1587 marks the point when many publications began adopting the imagery of ''Europa regina''.&lt;ref name=Schmale244/&gt;

==Description==

''Europa regina'' is a young, graceful woman.&lt;ref name=Werner244&gt;Werner (2009), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Her crown, placed on the [[Iberian peninsula]], is shaped after the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] [[hoop crown]].&lt;ref name=Werner244/&gt; [[France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] make up the upper part of her body, with [[Bohemia]] being the heart.&lt;ref name=Werner244/&gt; Her long gown stretches to [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Livonia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Muscovy]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Greece]]. In her arms, formed by [[Italy]] and [[Denmark]], she holds a [[sceptre]] and an [[globus cruciger|orb]] ([[Sicily]]).&lt;ref name=Werner244/&gt; In most depictions, [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and the [[Scandinavia]]n peninsula are partially shown,&lt;ref name=Werner244/&gt; as are a schematized [[British Isles]].

==Symbolism==
{{multiple image|direction=vertical|width=300|image1=Europe as a queen map.JPG|image2=Habsburg Map 1547.jpg|header=Europa regina and the [[House of Habsburg]]|footer=A rotated ''Europa regina'' compared to the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] realms (green) under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who in addition was [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (comprising [[Central Europe]], not shown)}}
In 1537, when the ''Europa regina'' was introduced, [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] had united the lands of the Habsburgs in his hands, including his country of origin, [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]].&lt;ref name=Wendehorst63/&gt; Thus, the map is oriented westwards to have Spain as the crowned head,&lt;ref name=Wendehorst63/&gt; pointing at the Habsburgs' claim to be universal emperors of Europe.&lt;ref name=Werner244/&gt; The most obvious connections to the Holy Roman Emperor are the Carolingian crown and the imperial ''insignia'' - sceptre and orb.&lt;ref name=Werner244/&gt; Another connection to Charles V is the gown, which resembles the contemporary dress code at the Habsburg court, and the face of the queen, which some say resembles Charles V's wife [[Isabella of Portugal|Isabella]].&lt;ref name=Werner245&gt;Werner (2009), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; As in contemporary portraits of couples, ''Europa regina'' has her head turned to her right and also holds the orb with her right hand, which has been interpreted as facing and offering power to her imaginary husband, the emperor.&lt;ref name=Werner245/&gt;

More general, Europe is shown as the ''res publica christiana'',&lt;ref name=Wendehorst63/&gt; the united [[Christendom]] in medieval tradition,&lt;ref name=Werner244/&gt; and [[great power|great]]&lt;ref name=Landwehr279/&gt; or even dominant power in the world.&lt;ref name=Werner245/&gt;

A third allegory is the attribution of Europe as the [[paradise]] by special placement of the water bodies.&lt;ref name=Wendehorst63/&gt; As contemporary iconography depicted the paradise as a closed form, ''Europa regina'' is enclosed by seas and rivers.&lt;ref name=Wendehorst63/&gt; The [[Danube]] river is depicted in a way that it resembles the course of the [[Bible|biblical]] river flowing through the paradise, with its estuary formed by four arms.&lt;ref name=Wendehorst63/&gt;

That ''Europa regina'' is surrounded by water is also an allusion to the [[Ancient Greece|antique]] [[Europe (mythology)|mythological Europe]], who was abducted by [[Zeus]] and carried over the water.&lt;ref name=Werner245/&gt;

''Europa regina'' belongs to the Early Modern allegory of ''[[Europa triumphans]]'', as opposed to ''[[Europa deplorans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Werner (2009), pp. 243ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related maps==

The art of shaping a map in a human form can also be found in a map drawn by Opicino de Canistris, showing the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref name=Borgolte16/&gt; This map, published in 1340 and thus predating the Putsch map, showed Europe as a man and Northern Africa as a woman.&lt;ref name=BennholdtThomsen22/&gt; 

While in ''Europa regina'' maps actual geography is subordinate to the female shape, the opposite approach is seen in a map drawn by Hendrik Kloekhoff and published by Francois Bohn in 1709. In this map, titled "''Europa. Volgens de nieuwste Verdeeling''" ("''Europe, according to the newest classification''"), a female is superimposed on a map showing a fairly accurate geography of Europe, and although the map is oriented westward with the Iberian Peninsula forming the head as in the ''Europa regina'' imagery, this is resulting in a ducked woman, corresponding with the ''Europa deplorans'' rather than the ''Europa triumphans'' allegory.&lt;ref name=BennholdtThomsen2224&gt;Bennholdt-Thomsen (1999), pp. 22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane also used the phrasing in other pamphlets including the "14 points" of his [[White genocide conspiracy theory|White Genocide Manifesto]] and further in his [[88 Precepts]] essay, stressing his support for racial and [[ethnic religion]]s, opposition to [[Multiracialism|universalism]], his opposition to [[miscegenation]], his [[anti-Americanism]],&lt;ref name="splc profile"/&gt; and support for [[racial segregation|racial separatism]].&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Werwolf!: The History of the National Socialist Guerrilla Movement, 1944–1946|last=Biddiscombe|first=Perry|publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1998|isbn=978-0-8020-0862-6 |at=note 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-truth-about-88-new-book-reveals-secret-meaning-of-neo-nazi-codes-a-770820.html|title=The Truth about 88: New Book Reveals Secret Meaning of Neo-Nazi Codes|date=June 27, 2011|work=[[Spiegel Online]]|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], the Fourteen Words slogan is derived from a passage in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s autobiographical book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', &lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/american-freedom-party |title=The American Freedom Party (formerly American Third Position) is a political party initially established by racist Southern California skinheads that aims to deport immigrants and return the United States to white rule. |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since the rise of the [[Alt-Right]], the Fourteen Words have become a popular Alt-Right meme&lt;ref name="knowyourmeme"&gt;{{cite web|title=14 Words, Know Your Meme|url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/14-words |publisher=Know Your Meme|accessdate=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Origins ==
[[File:Mein Kampf dust jacket.jpeg|thumb|Scholars say the slogan was influenced by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', which was also written from prison]]
A strong resemblance of the first definition to a statement in Adolf Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' has been pointed out, albeit not by Lane or by Fourteen Word Press. Scholars such as Barry Balleck have stated that Lane was almost certainly influenced by Hitler, specifically the following statement in ''Mein Kampf''.&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What we must fight for is to safeguard the existence and reproduction of our race and our people, the sustenance of our children and the purity of our blood, the freedom and independence of the fatherland, so that our people may mature for the fulfillment of the mission allotted it by the creator of the universe. Every thought and every idea, every doctrine and all knowledge, must serve this purpose. And everything must be examined from this point of view and used or rejected according to its utility. ''(Vol. I, Chapter 8)''&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4660">[[File:Gargee'an in Ahwaz 02.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Gargee'an celebration in [[Contemporary Arts Museum of Ahvaz]].]]
'''Gargee'an''' ({{lang-ar|قرقيعان}}), sometimes spelled as '''Gerga'oon''' (Arabic: قرقاعون), is a semiannual&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes the holiday is only celebrated annually, during the month of Ramadan.&lt;/ref&gt; celebration, observed primarily in [[Eastern Arabia]] ([[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]), [[Iraq]], and the [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan region]] in [[Iran]]. It takes place on the 15th night of the [[Islamic month]] of [[Sha'ban]] and on the 15th night of [[Ramadan]]. Gargee'an is marked with children dressing in traditional attire and going door-to-door to receive [[sweets]] and [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s from neighbours, whilst also singing traditional songs. The tradition has existed for hundreds of years and deeply rooted in [[Culture of Eastern Arabia|Gulf culture]].&lt;ref name=BNA&gt;{{cite news|title=القرقاعون من أهم الاحتفالات الرمضانية الشعبية في مملكة البحرين|url=http://www.bna.bh/portal/news/519354|accessdate=3 February 2013|newspaper=[[Bahrain News Agency]]|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the celebration of Gargee'an shares superficial similarities with the [[Halloween]] custom of [[trick-or-treating]], practiced in some western countries, Gargee'an has no connection with horror and no associated origin with Halloween.

== Etymology and Alternative Names ==
The exact origin of the word ''Qarqī'ān'' is unknown though several theories exist; One such theory states that it is derived from ''Qarqa'ah'' ({{lang-ar|قرقعة}}), which means ''click'' or ''snick'', the sound of iron pots carrying the sweets hitting each other while serving the sweets.&lt;ref name=BNA/&gt; Another theory says that it could originate from the kids of [[Medina]] singing "Qarrat Al-'Ain, Qarrat Al-'Ain" ([[Arabic]]: قرة العين) which was changed with time to ''Qarqī'ān''.

The holiday is also known by several different names in each region: Majeena or Karkiaan in [[Iraq]], Garangao or Garangaou in [[Qatar]] and [[Bahrain]], Karkee'aan or Qariqaan in [[Saudi Arabia]], Gargee'aan in [[Kuwait]], Garangashoch, At-Tablah or Qarnakosh in [[Oman]], and Hag Al Leylah in [[the UAE]].

==Religious significance==
Both Gerga'oon nights are significant to both Sunni and [[Shia]] Muslims. Gerga'oon on the 15th of Sha'ban marks the birthday of Imam [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], the 12th [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="نسائية سار الرياضي" تقيم مهرجان القرقاعون الأول|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/2170/news/read/162488/1.html|accessdate=4 February 2013|newspaper=Al Wasat|date=15 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerga'oon on the 15th of Ramadan coincides with the birth of Imam [[Hasan ibn Ali]], the second Imam in [[Shia Islam]]. As a result, the occasion is seen as a time of happiness and festivities by Shia Muslims, particularly in [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref name=Wasat&gt;{{cite news|title=القرقاعون: البحرين تحيي ليلة النصف من رمضان|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/75/news/read/122551/1.html|accessdate=3 February 2013|newspaper=Al Wasat|date=20 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events during the night include religious sermons conducted by [[mosque]]s, [[carnival]]-like attractions in much of the capital cities of the Persian Gulf region, such as in [[Manama]] and [[Doha]].&lt;ref name=Wasat/&gt;

==Tradition==
Children gather in small [[choir]] groups in front of a home and sing. The song is intended to call on [[Allah|God]] to bless the youngest child of the family, to keep him or her healthy that the mother will remain happy. The more they sing, the more nuts and sweets they receive. The Qarqee'an tradition is intended to spread love, happiness and affection among adults and children.

In modern times, supermarkets, corporates, and malls compete to attract children during this time via advertising in newspapers and on TV, and by offering special promotions and arranging closed Qarqee'an events to market themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="البحرين سيتي سنتر" يحتفل بليلة القرقاعون مساء اليوم|url=http://www.alayam.com/newsdetails.aspx?id=86247|accessdate=3 February 2013|newspaper=Al Ayam|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israeli ceramics''' are ceramics designed either in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] or [[Israel]] from the beginning of the 20th century. In additional to traditional [[pottery]], in Israel there are artists whose works were created in an industrial environment. Until the late 1970s there existed in Israel a local tradition that emphasized the local values of nature as an expression of [[Zionist]] identity. From the 1980s artistic expressions that sought to undercut this tradition began to appear in the works of Israeli artists, who combined ceramics with other artistic media and with personal, critical agendas.

==Beginning of ceramics in the Land of Israel, 1900–1930==

===Palestinian ceramics===
At the beginning of the 20th century the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] tradition of designing pottery from local materials dominated in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ''The Beginnings of Israeli Ceramics, 1932-1962'', Ceramic Artists Association of Israel. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery was primary functional, intended primarily for the use of the local population in the Land of Israel. Other vessels were imported from neighboring areas.

Pots were thrown on potter's wheels mostly in urban areas or in pottery villages. It was a craft traditionally worked by men.  In the census carried out on the streets of the land of Israel in 1928 during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], 77 pottery villages (of individuals or groups) were listed, while in the 1931 census, 211 different pottery villages were listed.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ziffer, Irit, "Water Vessels in Traditional Arab Pottery," in To the ''Fountain: The Maiden and the Jar: A Local and Multi-Cultural Image'', Kenaan-Kedar, Nurith (Curator) (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2013), 60. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the pottery villages were centralized, based on geographical proximity of the potters' families. Examples of this can be found in the pottery workshops held in the pottery villages in Rashia al Fakhar ([[Tel Faher]]) at the foot of [[Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Feldman,Nir, ''Material From the Wind: Chava Samuel, a Pioneer of Ceramic Art in Israel'' (Rishon LeZion: Rishon LeZion Museum, 2011), 11. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Or in [[Hebron]], at the various workshops of the Alfahori family. These pots were fired at a low temperature in traditional kilns that burned wood, charcoal, or animal droppings. Different workshops were held in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] as well, where they produced unique black pottery (فخار اسود), produced by adding organic materials, such as barley husks, to the kiln or by reduction firing. The smoke from the process of the burning of these materials within the kiln lent the pottery its characteristic black color.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ziffer, Irit, "Water Vessels in Traditional Arab Pottery," in ''To the Fountain: The Maiden and the Jar: A Local and Multi-Cultural Image'', Kenaan-Kedar, Nurith(Curator) (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2013), 47-48 [in Hebrew], and: Ziffer, Irit ,"A  Healthy Foundation for the Creations of the Younger Generation – A Note on Israeli Pottery Tradition,"  in ''The Third Biennale of Israeli Ceramics'' (Exhibition catalogue, Mark Tsatsula, ed.), Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2005), 110. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a tradition existed of producing pots made of clay mixed with straw or gravel for cooking and other utilitarian uses by the local population.  This work was carried out by hand by women, and the pots were fired in improvised kilns, in kitchen ovens, or sometimes not fired at all.  Pottery of this type, which was produced in the Samaria area and in [[Ramallah]], for example, was typically decorated with color made from rusted iron that originated in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Irit Ziffer, "A Healthy Foundation for the Creations of the Younger Generation – A Note on Israeli Pottery Tradition," in ''The Third Biennale of Israeli Ceramics'' (Exhibition catalogue, Mark Tsatsula, ed.), Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2005), 110. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the century progressed, this tradition began dying out as a result of industrialization, and in addition, from the 1980s competing pottery from other countries began to be imported.&lt;ref&gt;See: Shlomit Bauman, "Detachment and Continuity as an Influence on Creative Processes in Israeli Ceramic Design," ''History and Theory'', Bezalel II/16 – Creation Modes: Jewelry and Fashion, April 2010. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1989, for example, 11 different workshops were active in Hebron. However, by 2007 there remained only 8 potters there.&lt;ref&gt;Irit Ziffer, "Water Vessels in Traditional Arab Pottery," in ''To the Fountain: The Maiden and the Jar: A Local and Multi-Cultural Image'', Nurith  Kenaan-Kedar  (Curator) (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2013), 60. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1983 [[The Eretz Israel Museum]] mounted an exhibition displaying the pottery of the Lebanese village of Rashia al Fakhar.&lt;ref&gt;"Exhibitions," Davar (30 December 1983). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armenian ceramic art===
[[File:Armenian Room P1130760.JPG|thumb|right|250 px|Armenian Ceramics at the Jerusalem House of Quality ([[Saint John Eye Hospital Group]]), Jerusalem]]

In 1919 the British Mandate government invited a group of [[Armenians|Armenian]] potters, survivors of the Armenian Genocide, to repair the ceramic tiles of the [[Dome of the Rock]].  This experiment indicated the British interest in traditional art of the Arts and Crafts movement. Armenian ceramic art can be traced back to the 15th century, to the Turkish cities of [[İznik]] and [[Kütahya]], but the combination of the ancient art of the Land of Israel and Christian motifs created a unique artistic synthesis.

The outstanding artist of the early years was [[David Ohannessian]], who specialized in the design of ceramic decorative art in buildings and monuments, many of which were commissioned by the British Mandate government. The workshop that he founded – "The Dome of the Rock Tiles" – produced not only monumental works, but also utilitarian and decorative pottery. Among the most important works Ohannessian produced in Jerusalem were tiles for the [[American Colony Hotel]] (1923), the fountain house in St. John's Hospital, the tiled dome in the [[Rockefeller Museum]] garden, etc. Among the motifs that appear in his decorations are the [[Cypress]]es trees, [[tulip]]s, and grapevines typical of traditional Seljuk and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] decorative art.&lt;ref&gt;See: Nurith  Kenaan-Kedar, ''The Armenian Ceramics of Jerusalem'' (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, 2002), 29-52.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Ohannessian introduced some unique Jerusalem iconography to his works, figures derived from Armenian medieval illuminations, historic designs and forms from European renaissance majolica, and bird motifs drawn from an Armenian Jerusalem 5th-6th century mosaic floor, discovered during an archeological dig in the Holy City during the 1890s, to name a few.

The workshop that Ohannessian founded in Jerusalem followed the tradition of ceramic making as he had practiced and overseen it in his atelier in Kutahya, in Ottoman Anatolia, which had flourished prior to World War I and his deportation to the Syrian desert. According to traditional methods, the processes of clay and glaze mixing, wheel throwing, design, painting, and firing were performed by a variety of artisans, all supervised by Ohannessian, some of whom specialized in design and others who were experts at the potter's wheel. Ohannessian was skilled himself in all facets of the art and trained a variety of apprentices, as he had done in Anatolia. He maintained particular expertise in painting ceramics and design. Upon the founding of his workshop on the Via Dolorosa, he cooperated with [[Near East Relief]], to train a number of Armenian orphans of the genocide, giving them the skills to engage in the art on a professional basis. Some of his workshop's output, especially the monumental architectural tile works, were signed by the chief artist. Numerous other vases and plates identified their respective makers through small glazed initials on the bottom, usually painted in ochre. Ohannessian's workshop used a stone wood-burning kiln, built to his specifications in 1919.  The model implemented in this workshop was used for other Armenian workshops founded subsequently in Jerusalem.

The artists [[Megardish Karakashian]] and [[Nishan Balian]], who left Ohannessian's workshop in 1922, founded a workshop together called "Palestine Pottery," where they developed a line of design with figurative images that were alien to traditional Turkish ceramic art.  For example, the two of them combined designs from ancient mosaics discovered in the Land of Israel, such as the "Birds Mosaic" (Jerusalem) or the mosaic from [[Hisham's Palace]] in [[Jericho]]. Often these images were imbued with Christian  theological interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;See: Nurith Kenaan-Kedar, ''The Armenian Ceramics of Jerusalem'' (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, 2002), 53-91. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The joint workshop functioned continually until 1964, when Stefan Karakashian&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Stern, "Beit Hayotzer at Netiv Hayisurim," ''Al Hamishmar'', (18 August 1967). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and Marie Balian, heirs of the founders, founded two separate workshops that made use of images from the past as well as new images that they created.

===The ceramics of Bezalel===

Within the framework of the "[[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Beazlel School of Art and Craft]]", a ceramics studio was founded in 1924, with [[Jacob Eisenberg]] at its head.&lt;ref&gt;Nurit Shilo-Cohen, ''Schatz's "Bezalel," 1906-1929'' (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1980), 364.  [in Hebrew]  These were the last years (1920-1929) of the institution that saw itself during this period less and less as an academy of art, and more and more as a series of partially independent art workshops.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1917 [[Boris Schatz]] was considering opening a department for the design of cast decorative items, as well as a department of painting on "porcelain."  This craft was already being taught at Bezalel using ready-made porcelain brought in from outside Palestine for use at Bezalel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Boris Schatz, "How to Encourage and Promote Home Crafts in Jerusalem and in Eretz Israel in General," printed in: ''Bezalel: 1906-1929'', ed. Nurit Shilo-Cohen (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1980), 149-186, especially 173-175, and also: Bezalel 100, Book 1, ed. David Tartakover and Gideon Ofrat (Jerusalem: Hapais Council for the Culture and Arts, 2006), 174. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Schatz saw in the activity of the factory for bricks and roofing tiles that operated on the grounds of the "[[Schneller Orphanage]]" in Jerusalem from approximately 1895, proof of the practicality of such a local industry, which would make use of local materials brought from [[Motza]].

Eisenberg, who was a student at Bezalel from 1913 to 1919, after his graduation went to study in [[Vienna]], at the School for Arts and Crafts, where he took a continuing education course in ceramic design and production.&lt;ref&gt;Many of Bezalel's pupils, such as [[Nachum Gutman]], [[Israel Hirschfeld]], and others, went to [[Vienna]] for training.&lt;/ref&gt; The department separated the design of the ceramics, mostly taught by Bezalel instructors and particularly by [[Ze'ev Raban]], from the practical production of the pieces.  Of the objects produced in this department, the best known are the wall tiles and decorations from the 1920s and 1930s. These works include the tiles on the walls of the Ahad HaAm School, the [[Bialik House]], and the Lederberg House in Tel Aviv, and in the synagogue of Moshav Zekanim.

The style of tile design was influenced by Art [[Art Nouveau]] and by the "[[Jugendstil]] style.  This style is expressed in the flatness of the area described and in the richly decorated borders.  With regard to ideas, "Bezalel tiles" expressed a tendency toward transcendentalism, seen in their borders cast with images taken from [[Jewish]] tradition and [[Zionism|Zionist]] content.&lt;ref&gt;See: Alec Mishory, ""Zionist Resurrection on the Facade of 'The Municipal School' in Tel-Aviv," in ''Lo and Behold'' (Tel Aviv, Am Oved, 2000), 94-116. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of Hebrew ceramics, 1932–1950==
[[File:Mira libes and hava samuel next to the kiln.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|[[Mira libes]] (left) and [[Chava Samuel]] (right) next to the kiln, [[Rishon LeZion]]]]
In her article "Techno Tools: The Logical Ones" (2011),&lt;ref&gt;Shlomit Bauman, "Ceramic design: Techno.logical Implements," ''Sixth Biennale of Israeli Ceramics'' (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2011). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shlomit Bauman]] maintained that contemporary Israeli ceramics is characterized by a disconnect from the Palestinian tradition and by "a lack of a local ceramics industry that would permit a dialog of understanding between local ceramic artists."&lt;ref&gt;Shlomit Bauman, "Ceramic design: Techno.logical Implements," ''Sixth Biennale of Israeli Ceramics'' (Tel Aviv: Eretz Israel Museum, 2011), pp 10-11 [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the Armenians and the Arabs living in the Palestine worked within independent traditions, Jewish artists had to create a synthesis between European art and art in the Land of Israel under the conditions that existed there in the early 20th century.  This can be seen both in the design of the models and in the work techniques, which tended to be mechanized. In addition, while local pottery depended on family-led workshops and on cooperative activity by the artists, the Jewish potter saw himself both as an artist and as an expression of the language of art.&lt;ref&gt;See: ^Shlomit Bauman, "Materialism Liberated," Joram Rosenheimer, ed., ''Maud Friedland'' ([Tel Aviv]: Rosenheimer family, in collaboration with: Ceramic Artists Association of Israel, 2011), 13. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chava (Eva) Samuel|Chava Samuel]], who Immigrated to the Palestine in 1932, founded "Hayozer" [The Creator], the first ceramics workshop in the Jewish community in Jerusalem. "Kad VeSefel" [Jug and Cup], the ceramics workshop founded in 1934 in [[Rishon LeZion]] with [[Paula Ahronson]], produced a variety of utilitarian pots and decorative pottery, using a combination of potter's wheel and ceramic casting. The style of the pots was, for the most part functional, influenced both by the spirit of [[modernism]] and the European [[Bauhaus]] style. [[Mira Libes]], a pupil in the workshop of Samuel and Ahronson, described the pottery produced in the workshop as the direct result of "create pottery that is simple, functional, and beautiful," a philosophy intended also to improve public taste, which was deemed at that time indescribably bad. The pottery produced was generally influenced by the "Bauhaus" style, which Paula had studied, and the simple and beautiful decorative-colorful style of Eva."[18]

The motifs of the decorations on Samuel's pottery were also influenced by the archeology of the Land of Israel, as well as by Oriental art, under whose influence she produced "Eastern" images and images from the Jewish world. As opposed to the figures from the Jewish world created by the artists of the "Bezalel" school, Samuel's imaged lacked the religious dimension. The images that remained, for the most part looked like images from folklore. The decorative style of Samuel's pottery focused on individual images, drawn primarily freehand and glazed.&lt;ref&gt;Chava Samuel – Ceramicist (Jerusalem: Bezalel, 1985. Cited in: Gideon Ofrat, ''The Beginnings of Israeli Ceramics'', 1932-1962, note 3, Ceramic Artists Association of Israel. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the pottery of Samuel and Ahronson, the works of [[Hedwig Grossman]] displayed an attempt to formulate a Land of Israel "localness" in their ceramic design. Grossman made [[Aliyah]] to the Land of Israel in 1933 after studying pottery in Germany. During her first years in Palestine, Grossman already began to carry out soil surveys to determine how local materials were used in pottery production. In addition, Grossman researched how pottery was made in the Land of Israel in ancient times and what where the work methods of Arab and Armenian potters throughout the Land. In her work Grossman emphasized the use of materials from the Land of Israel. Some of her work was even influenced by local archaeological findings. Her techniques for working the material included basic geometric decoration, using local non-glaze slips ([[Slipware|engobes]]) in assorted colors.

An echo of Grossman's views can be seen in the 1940s, when [[Jacob Lev]], who served from 1939 as the head of the Sculpture Department in the "[[Bezalel|New Bezalel]]," began to offer classes in pottery in the department. Most of the pots that were made in this institution were not fired in a kiln and so did not survive, but in his article "The Pretty Pot"&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Lev, "The Pretty Pot," in: ''Bezalel ha-Hadash'' [The New Bezalel: Journal of Problems in Artistic Design] (Jerusalem: New Bezalel), no. 1 ( 941). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; (1941), he emphasizes the modernist approach to design of the pot and the relationship between its parts in the "Bauhaus" spirit. However photographs of the pots show the influence of the architecture of the Land of Israel in the choice of the types of pots, as well as in the avoidance of decoration in the rough texture of their design.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ''Bezalel ha-Hadash'' [The New Bezalel: Journal of Problems in Artistic Design] (Jerusalem: Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design), 1987. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of [[Hedwig Harag Zunz]], who arrived in the Land of Israel at the beginning of the 1940s, also represent an attempt at creating pottery with a Land of Israel "localness." In Zunz's works this was expressed primarily in her choice of local materials. Most of her work was produced using a potter's wheel, but she also created pottery with an architectural bent. In spite of her consistent use of local materials, Zunz's works differ from the archaeological direction of Hedwig Grossman's works or the oriental decoration of Eva Samuel's.  The shape of her pottery was influenced by European Modernism in its lack of decoration and in its organic tendency toward the use of the glossy surface slips of [[Terra sigillata]] or ceramic glazes.&lt;ref&gt;See: Michal Alon, "Hanna Harag Zunz: Pioneer in Ceramic Art," ''1280°c''. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her independent works, Harag Zunz also produced technical academic research and participated in various industrial projects.

==From landscape to clay, 1950–1980==
In the 1950s and 1960s there was an upswing in ceramic activity in Israel, and steps were taken toward institutionalizing ceramics as a branch of art. Alongside traditional pottery and the newly established "Studio Pottery", other forms of media began to develop, including ceramic sculpture and industrial initiatives, a small-scale industry that took its spiritual roots from European Modernism. In general, ceramic artists, like many other Israeli artists, strove toward "localness", with its identification with the land, the landscape, and the archaeology of the Land of Israel.

===Industrialization===
[[file:Harsa003.jpg|250 px|thumb|right|[[Nehemia Azaz]] at [[Harsa Ceramics]]]]
[[file:Lapid 001.jpg|250 px|thumb|right|Vases from Lapid and Harsa Ceramics, [[Davar]], 23 October 1959]]
From the very beginning of the ceramics industry in Israel, ceramic objects were produced in casting molds.  However, the development of the Zionist industry gave impetus to speedy industrialization.[24]  The main area in which the ceramics industry developed was Haifa, where in 1938 "[[Naaman]]" where cast porcelain objects were produced, was founded.[25]  In the exhibition "Applied Art and the Prescription for Industry in the Land of Israel," held in the [[Bezalel Museum]] in Jerusalem in 1947, glazed pots were displayed by [[Hanna Harag Zunz]] as an example of cooperation among various elements of the industry.[26] In 1955 in the [[Haifa Museum of Art]] an exhibition entitled "The Ceramic Society" was mounted, in which objects and the processes of their production in the local ceramics industry were displayed.&lt;ref&gt;See: Pesel Fridberg, "Exhibition: 'The Ceramic Company', Haifa Museum of Art," ''AlHamishmar'', 30 December 1955. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s saw the beginning of practical cooperation between the ceramics industry and the designers and artists in the young state, with an eye to advancing the industry and raising its prestige. Similar initiatives took place in the 1960s in Israel Ceramic and Silicate Institute in the Technion, and in Bezalel, where they began testing ceramic materials for design.

[[Aharon Kahana]] - who with his wife founded "Beit Hayotzer" [Artisan's Workshop] (Haifa), which was so large he employed three assistant potters—succeeded in defining a widespread style that combined modernist abstraction with decorative folk motifs. This combination succeeded in "returning art to the people."&lt;ref name="AlHamishmar 6 February 1959"&gt;''AlHamishmar'', 6 February 1959 [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and "making use of many shapes, which had been unacceptable in the eyes of the viewers, as decoration for ceramic creations.&lt;ref name="AlHamishmar 6 February 1959"/&gt;

Among the better known ceramic production plants were "Kol-Keramic" (Haifa), "Carnet" (Netanya Ceramics),"Ceramit" (Netanya) "Beit Halachmi" (Tel Aviv), "Bror Hayil (Bror Hayil), "Keramaklin" (Nes Tziona), "Palkeramic" (Haifa), and "Beit Hayotzer" (Ramat Gan/Petah Tikva), the ceramics workshop of Kfar Menachem, etc.  At the same time, the two most important factories were "Lapid Pottery" (1951) and "Harsa Ceramics (1956)," which combined technology with handmade techniques.

In 1952 Elisabeth Cohen came to work as a designer for Lapid Pottery.  Elisabeth Cohen had studied with Hedwig Grossman and founded the "art" department in the company.  By 1959 this department employed 20 people.&lt;ref&gt;See: Beitar, "Lapid Produces New Bathroom Fixtures," ''Davar'', 28 March 1956. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning the company produced utilitarian pots cast from the materials used to cast toilets, but little by little both the methods and the designs of the company became more sophisticated.  In addition to Cohen other designers, including [[Maud Friedland]], came to work for the company. Another art department produced ceramics in the [[Harsa Ceramics company]] from 1956-1966.&lt;ref&gt;See: Pnina Arouetty, ''Earthenware Pottery, 1956-1966'' (Ramat Gan: Beit Aharon Kahana, 2007). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  The department was founded by [[Nehemia Azaz]], who designed his pots using local colors and materials.&lt;ref&gt;See: Israeli, Art, "The Department of 'Earthenware' Art 1955-1966," ''1280o C'', 27 Summer (2013), 24-18. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, the department employed 30 workers. After Azaz left the department, it was run by [[Pnina Zamir Amir]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Pnina Arouetty, ''Pnina Amir-Zamir'' (Ramat Gan: Beit Aharon Kahana, 2010). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles made in both companies were modernist in style and were characterized by the use of geometric styles and primarily abstract decoration.  These designs were influenced by the tradition of modernist design, from designs created in Europe during this same period, and therefore by what was perceived as the expression of Land of Israel "localness."  Azaz, for example, stated that his forms were influenced by the desert landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Aviva Limon, "''Interview with Nehemia Azaz''," (in Hebrew), 6 May 1990, can be found in the Information Center for Israeli Art, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem and in the archive of Beit Benyamini, Tel Aviv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of porcelain by ceramics companies was concentrated for the most part in the "Naaman" and "Lapid" factories, both of which produced primarily utilitarian utensils. At the same time it is known that the industry tried to encourage local design.  Shimon Badar, for example, who was the first designer for "Naaman," also served as a lecturer on ceramic technology at the Ceramic Department of Bezalel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Shir Mellor-Yamaguchi and Anat Turbowicz, ''White Matter: Contemporary Porcelain Sculpture'' (Kibbutz Hazorea: Wilfrid Israel Museum, 2015), 5. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a large scale technological–artistic project  is the covering of the entrance to Asia House (1977-1979) in tiles produced in the porcelain molds next to "Naaman" and designed by the artist  Pinchas Eshet.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Pinchas Eshet, Porcelain Sculptures'' (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Modern Art, 1980,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studio pottery===
The 1950s and 1960s were the most important years of ceramic activity in the field of Israeli art.  For the first time ceramic artists began to be trained in many private workshops and a variety of academic institutions.  In addition, decorative arts –including ceramic art – were no longer perceived as a foreign element in the young Israeli culture.  To a large extent these forms of media were encouraged by various government agencies.  Finally, an examination of the creations of the artists demonstrates the inculcation of a local artistic "tradition" that chose to cut itself off from the Arab ceramic tradition, the Armenian tradition, and even that of Bezalel, in favor of "modernism" and "localness," which determined the central direction of Israeli ceramics until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See the definition of Sarah Chinsky for the project inventing the Bezalel "tradition."  Sarah Chinsky, ''The Monarchy of the Land of the Humble: the Social Grammar of Local Art'' (Tel Aviv: HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, 2015), 96-97. [In Hebrew].&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Hedwig Grossman]], who taught most young ceramicists in her Jerusalem studio and in [[Ein Hod]], and from 1964 in [[Givatayim]], [[Hanna Harag Zunz]] also taught them in the Oranim Seminar (today [[Oranim Academic College]]), [[Paula Ahronson]] at Wizo in Tel Aviv, and [[Gedula Ogen]] at Havat HaNoar HaTzioni (Israel Goldstein Youth Village).  In 1957 the department of ceramics at The Arts Institute at Tel-Hai College opened.&lt;ref&gt;See: Tel Hai College, Pottery, 7, August (1980), 3-7. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958 the Department of Ceramics and Glass Design at [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design]] was founded, next to the Schneller Orphanage.  The department was headed by David Wachtel, who had worked previously at the "Palkeramics" factory.  His teaching faculty included [[David Calderon]], [[Pnina Amir-Zamir]], and Maud Friedland.  In 1962 Gedula Ogen was appointed head of the department.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Bezalel 100, Book 2, 1935-1965'', David Tartakover and Gideon Ofrat, eds. (Tel Aviv: The National Lottery Council for Arts and Culture, 2006), 189. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1961 and 1963 the number of students in the department grew from 26 to 50, and the amount of work space in the department  greatly increased.[38]  Another teaching institution was the "Visual Arts Center" in Beersheba.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Bezalel 100, Book 2, 1935-1965'', David Tartakover and Gideon Ofrat, eds. (Tel Aviv: The National Lottery Council for Arts and Culture, 2006), 191, 201. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the standpoint of design, the ceramicists continued the tradition of Harag Zunz and particularly the tradition of Grossman, in everything connected to the spirit of European Modernism and in the aspiration toward the expression of what was local in their works.  Among the most significant followers of Grossman are Amnon Israeli and Gedula Ogen. From the 1960s both of them took the inspiration for their work from archaeology and the Land of Israel landscape, expressed in works that were unglazed and coated in slip&lt;ref&gt;A color based on liquid clay mixed with natural and artificial pigments.  Close variations are called "slip."&lt;/ref&gt; or exposed to an open fire during their firing.&lt;ref&gt;See: Inna Arouetty, ''Gedula Ogen: Like Nature'' (Ramat Gan: Beit Aharon Kahana, 1996).  Also, Inna Arouetty, Hedwig Grossman/Amnon Israel  (Ramat Gan: Beit Aharon Kahana,2014). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent ceramic artists were [[Yehudit Meir]] and [[Yocheved Marx]], who worked together in Beersheba from 1958, using local materials from the earth of the Negev and fired their works at very high temperatures (1250-1300 degrees C), which was atypical for Israeli ceramicists of that period.   The works they created spanned the field from decorative to practical.

The opportunities for exhibiting and selling ceramics during that period were limited and led to the production, for the most part, of practical ceramic ware. Along with exhibitions at "Mikra-Studio" gallery (Tel Aviv, 1946-1956), which combined emphasizing artistic values with exhibiting female ceramic artists,&lt;ref&gt;Among those displaying in the gallery in the field of sculpture: Aharon Kahana (1952), Hava Mehutan (1955), Nehemia Azaz (1956).  Moshe Gershuni, for example, reported that he acquired works by Kahana, Harag Zunz, Hedwig Grossman, Jean Mayer, and others in this gallery and in the store in the neighboring building on the corner of Ben Yehudah and Idelson Streets.  See: Moshe Gershuni, "Indian Ceramics," in Sarah Breitberg Semel, Gershuni (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2010), 314. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Atelier 97" (Tel Aviv),&lt;ref&gt;Chava Samuel (1960), Shelly Harari (1960), Jean Mayer&lt;/ref&gt; ceramics were sold at the Maskit stores (Tel Aviv, 1959- ?), which emphasized folkloristic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the artists mounted entire exhibitions, while others displayed their works in a group exhibition or displayed special art objects for sale. The following names were listed on the exhibit: Idit Adi and Miriam Magnus (1968), Hanna Baharal (1966, 1970), Rina Peled (1969, 1971), Miriam Zamir (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition there were a number of exhibitions of ceramic art at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and at the Bezalel Museum and at a variety of private stores.&lt;ref&gt;In the brochure Kad ve-sefer , for example, there is a list of branches of "Maskit," "Tuv taam", and "Tessora" stores in Tel Aviv, and "Charlotte" and the "Schwartz" department store in Jerusalem.  See: Nir Feldman, Material From the Wind: Chava Samuel, a Pioneer of Ceramic Art in Israel (Rishon LeZion: Rishon LeZion Museum, 2011),83. [in Hebrew]  Bertha Ordung's daughter described Hedwig Grossman's works, which were offered for sale in Rina Galleria in Jerusalem.  Other stores include "Ginger" in Jerusalem, "Traklin" and "Herzog" in Haifa, and "Galeria 119" in Tel Aviv.&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of ceramic artists were not members of a professional artists' union, and if they were, like Grossman and Samuel, within that framework they exhibited primarily paintings and prints.  In 1966 in Tel Aviv the "Clay Museum" opened as part of the Eretz Israel Museum, exhibiting ancient ceramics next to exhibitions of Israeli artists who exhibited in the open courtyard of the pavilion.  In 1968 the Ceramic Artists Association of Israel was founded, headed by Joseph Blumenthal.

In 1963 the book Art in Israel was published, under the editorship of [[Benjamin Tammuz]].&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Art in Israel'', Benjamin Tammuz, ed., (Tel Aviv: Masada, 1963).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The book devoted an entire chapter to art that John Cheney compiled.  In this chapter, which was accompanied by a number of photographs, Cheney surveyed such areas of art as design, jewelry making, and ceramics, which he juxtaposed to media such as drawing, sculpture, and architecture.  The presentation of ceramics and the rest of the arts as equal to other artistic media, bears witness to the importance of art during those years and its promotion by exhibitions and competitions organized by institutions such as the Israel Packaging Institute and the Israel Export Institution, etc.  On 24 September 1970, an exhibition opened in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art that surveyed the field of ceramics in Israel and was the ultimate expression of this trend.  The exhibition – "Israel Ceramics 70" – displayed 284 works of 64 artists, along with a detailed catalog that included photographs of the works as well.  In addition the works produced by another five factories ("Beit Hayotser," "Lapid," "Naaman," "Palkeramic," and "Carnet."&lt;ref&gt;See Haim Gamzo, ''Israel Ceramics 70'' (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1970). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ein Hod school===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 13693 Ceramic wall by Louise Schatz Ein Hod.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Ceramic wall by [[Louise Schatz]], Ein Hod]]
In 1957, in close proximity to one another, [[Itche Mambush]] and his wife [[Aviva Margalit]] opened pottery workshops in [[Ein Hod]] Artists Village. The village was founded in 1953 by [[Marcel Janco]], as a village for the arts and artists. Around the workshops a group of resident artists and artists who lived nearby began to add ceramics to one of the media in which they worked. Some of these artists were identified with "New Horizons," that is, Janco, [[Yehezkel Streichman]], [[Pinchas Abramovich]], and [[Aharon Kahana]], who worked alongside artists for whom the decorative style was an integral part of their art, such as [[Louise Schatz]], [[Bezalel Schatz]], [[Jean David]], [[Genia Berger]], etc.

In their works we see a colorful, expressive approach with an emphasis on glazes not typical of the "material" tradition in local ceramics. In addition to a small amount of ceramic sculpture, these artists produced many paintings using glazing techniques, and murals using a variety of glazed ceramic tiles.&lt;ref&gt;See: Galia Bar Or and Gideon Ofrat, ''The First Decade: A Hegemony and a Plurality'' (Ein Harod: Mishkan Museum of Art, 2008), 22-23; See also: Gideon Ofrat, Archeological Ceramics: Pottery and Walls ' Aharon Kahana, Monograph (5), on the website Gideon Ofrat's Storeroom [In Hebrew].&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the artists worked the materials themselves, while others produced detailed sketches for items to be implemented in different workshops, such as the ones in Ein Hod or the one in [[Kfar Menachem]].
 
These decorative walls were part of the trend towards combining art with local architecture, and were used by other artists along with other techniques such as sgrafitto and mosaics.  One of the best known artistic event in this field took place in 1954, when a group of ceramic wall paintings by [[Aharon Kahana]], [[Jean David]], and [[Gedula Ogen]] were put in place on the [[Givat Ram]] campus of [[The Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In 1958 sketches of these walls were even presented in the exhibition "Ten Years of Architecture in Israel" in the [[Tel Aviv Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Rachel Engel, "Between Painters and Architects: Architectural Exhibition at the Tel Aviv Museum," ''Davar'', 3 October 1958. [In Hebrew].&lt;/ref&gt; The peak of this creativity was in 1966, when an international hands-on seminar in ceramics took place in Ein Hod, at Berger's initiative.

In the second half of the 1960s the influence of different kinds of media began to appear in the works of Israeli ceramicists.  In particular the influence of Israeli sculptors could be seen. Along with the continuing use of "architectural" images and the trend toward "localness," it could be seen in the use of images of the land and desert landscapes, a divergence from the boundaries of traditional ceramics.  The aspiration toward copying nature into works of art forced the artists into seeking new artistic expressions.

The status of Land of Israel architecture as the expression of Zionist nationalism attracted not only the broad public, but also many ceramicists, to it.&lt;ref&gt;An example of this kind of connection can be found in the dictionary of Hebrew pottery terms published in 1950 by the Hebrew Language Committee (Dictionary of Pottery Terms [Jerusalem: Hebrew Language Committee, with the participation of the Bialik Institute, 1950]). See: Meira Yagid-Haimovich, Israeli Pottery: A Footnote; ''Irit Abba, Wheel. Period'' (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2009), 6. [In Hebrew] This dictionary was the work of the "Committee for Architectural Terms," which comprised a natural bridge between architecture, ceramics, and pottery of that period.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them utilized the skills they had acquired in the restoration of pottery, which was found in great numbers in the archeological digs of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;See: Michael Feige, Tzvi Shiloni, eds. ''A Pickaxe to Dig With: Archeology and Nationalism in the Land of Israel'' (Beer-Sheva: Ben Gurion University of the Negev, 2008). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was natural, therefore, that architectural images appeared in the works of Israeli artists.  A whole group of artists such as [[David Ben Shaul]], [[Agi Yoeli]], [[David Calderon]], [[Moshe Shek]], and [[Shelly Harari]], in addition to their ceramic works, produced during this period human sculptures or animal images inspired by figurines and statuettes from antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;See: Benjamin Tammuz, ed. ''The Story of Art in Israel'' (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishers, 1980), 155-156. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Their works included a pioneering Zionist element that expressed an attempt to connect the young Israeli state with its historical and biblical past.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, "The Dialectics of the 1950s," in: Galia Bar-Or and Gideon Ofrat, The First Decade: A Hegemony and a Plurality (Ein Harod: Museum of Art, Ein Harod, 2008), 24. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Israeli ceramicists showed a tendency toward modernism, which emphasized the geometric character of the shape and the work and showed the influence of European modernism.

Most of the characteristics of sculpture can be found in works that originated on potter's wheels during those years.  A central element in the widespread distribution of works of this genre was the teaching of Gedula Ogen at Bezalel.  Ogen developed a style using the potter's wheel to achieve the volume needed for large scale relief sculpture and figurative sculpture.  In her works she continued Grossman's style of design in her emphasis on the naturally colorful quality of the material.  Most of her work dealt with images from nature and with the relationship between it and culture and art.

The main reason for the shift in style during the 1960s that deviated from the previous tradition by opening the field of Israeli ceramics to varied new points of view, was the arrival and influence of ceramics producers and professional ceramic artists, the practical implementation of which could be seen in the works of David Morris, Magdalena Hefetz, Sonia Natra and others who studied and became specialists in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, The Beginning of Israeli Ceramics 1932-1962, 17. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

An article from 1972 describes the creation of one of these sculptures by [[Rina Peleg]], a graduate of Bezalel, who "leaning heavily on the potter's wheel and round motions, creates the body of her sculpture. Only after this does she knead and shape the finished form with her hands, creating its decoration and ornamentation."&lt;ref name="Plank 36-39"&gt;Shlomit Bauman, "Shlomit Bauman in a Conversation with Rina Kimchi, 'A Plank in a Burned-out House'," ''1280°'', 11 (2004), 36-39. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; However she soon began to request that the artists "jettison the jug"&lt;ref name="Plank 36-39"/&gt; and the decorative dimension of traditional ceramics in favor of freestanding art.  Artists such as [[Neta Avraham]], Shelly Harari, [[Nora and Naomi]], [[Jean Meir]], Maud Friedland, and others, deviated from the tradition of "sculpting with the potter's wheel" in order to try out different techniques, particularly freestanding sculpture.  A central motif was the imitation of formations found in local landscapes and their conversion into objects of sculpture.

The Israeli landscape, especially the desert landscape, was perceived as isolated from modern westernized society, and served as an inspiration to artists in creating the form, texture, and color of artistic objects.  In this way these artists joined the general trend among many other Israeli artists who created in their works images of an archaic utopia, many of them even under the late influence of "Canaanite" art.  The objects they created tended towards abstract plant structures or towards the building of objects that suggested archaic cultural structures.

As ceramics drew closer to the field of art, however, foreign influences also creeped into the Israeli tradition.  [[Siona Shimshi]], for example, during these years returned from studies in the United States, where she had been exposed to postmodern art, such as Pop Art.  Her ceramic works combined these influences with biographical works and psychological images.  For example, in her works such as "Puppet Theater"
&lt;ref&gt;For photo of the work: See: Haim Gamzo, ''Israeli Ceramics 70'' (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1970). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; or "Class Photo 1939" (1965), the artist aimed to express psychological and social themes, something that was unusual in Israeli ceramics of the time.&lt;ref&gt;See Aya Miron, "Ziona Shemesh," in: ''1965 Today'', Mira Lapidot, Curator (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2015), 138-241.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1960s, large scale sculptures began to appear in Israeli art, such as the bronze sculpture "Sheep of the Negev" by [[Itzhak Danziger]], Assemblage art works, such as those of [[Igael Tumarkin]] and [[Yehiel Shemi]], or works making use of various techniques such as installations or the use of non-artistic materials, such as those created by the artists of the group "Ten Plus," while at the same time ceramic works continued to be limited by the size of the kilns in which they were fired.  However, apparently it was the influence of conceptual art, which arrived in Israel in the 1970s, that cut off ceramic activity from Israeli art.  This is particularly noticeable against the background of "earth" and "place" imagery among the Israeli artistic vanguard of this period.

==From deconstruction to reconstruction, 1980–2010==
In the 1980s a fundamental change occurred in the way Israeli ceramic art was perceived.  The primary cause of the change was the disruption of the local tradition in Israeli ceramics.  Some of the reasons can be discerned in the perception of a break which Israeli society felt in a delayed reaction to the [[Yom Kippur War]], and in reaction to the First Intifada.&lt;ref&gt;Ilana Tannenbaum, "The Time of the Post: the 1980s in Israeli Art," in: ''Check Post: the 1980s in Israeli Art'' (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2008), 23-24. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the influence of postmodern culture began to trickle into the local culture.

Even though postmodernism had once been described as the expression of "the personal, [with a tendency towards the] hand-made, metaphorical, figurative, [and] decorative",&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, "Post Modernism," ''Achshav'', 47-48 (1983), 270.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; traits that came naturally to Israeli ceramic artists and their art, paradoxically the distance between them and mainstream Israeli art widened.  At the same time, in painting, sculpture, and photography objections began to be heard against the status of the object as a work of art, whereas until the 1990s the field of Israeli ceramics had primarily adopted the attitude of "identity politics," as the central tenet of postmodernism.  In place of historical and archeological relationships, a series of personal relationships began to appear, most of them expressivist, which deviated from the traditional Israeli ceramic tradition that had existed up to this time.

This sidelining of ceramics, and especially of pottery, from the main museums,&lt;ref&gt;Until 1993, when Lidia Zavatsky had an exhibition, there had never been an exhibition of ceramics (ceramic design and pottery) in the department of Design and Architecture of the Israel Museum.  See: Design and Architecture in the Israel Museum: Portrait of a Department 1973-1997 (Jerusalem: Israel Museum). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is true that Gideon Ofrat mentioned in the chapter dealing with "Canaan" in ''The Story of Art in Israel'', Benjamin Tammuz, ed. (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishers, 1980), the attention the field of art paid to the early days of Israeli ceramics and to Ziona Shemesh, in her interview in Eser Plus, but it is well known that the part that the various design media played is missing from the history of Israeli art.&lt;/ref&gt; led to the establishment of a number of independent cooperative galleries in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,&lt;ref&gt;See: Yigal Zalmona, ''100 Years of Israeli Art'' (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2010), 336. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; for the display and merchandising of ceramics, such as "Ruach Cadim" (1987), the  "Altogether 8" group (1990), and "Shlush Shloshim (1992).  In 1991 Aharon Kahana's house in [[Ramat Gan]] was opened as a ceramics gallery.

===Myths in the material, 1980-1990===
In spite of the marginal place the medium occupied, postmodern expressions in ceramics did have a certain impact because of the works of [[Gideon Ofrat]], one of the most important of the artists who translated postmodern thinking into an aesthetic in the 1980s. In 1985 Ofrat curated the exhibition "Toward a Myth Without God" in the [[Jerusalem Artists House]].  In the exhibition catalog, Ofrat described ceramics as an expression of metaphysics, and pottery and pots as a means of direct connection to nature.  A connection that Ofrat described as a dialectic of "proceeding toward a double eternity – an eternity of absorbing living and an eternity of absorbing dying"&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, Towards a Godless Myth (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Artists House, 1985), 63. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; connected to the practicality and the symbolism of the pottery.  In this Ofrat reflected the phenomology of Martin Heidegger and Derrida, who emphasized earth and object (and the pitcher as a characteristic expression of this) as an intersection between life and death.&lt;ref&gt;See also the later article of Ofrat, "The Slopes and the Names." [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the artists sought to probe the personal and the biographical through archetypal images, and thus express the symbolic dimension of art.  From the point of view of form, it was manifested by developing means of sculptural expression in a more figurative direction and with a tendency toward ignoring the individual object in favor of the sculptural array.&lt;ref&gt;For the most part, ceramic artists tended to display their sculptures and not installations, whose avant garde roots were expressed by exposing the means of creation of the exhibition itself.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Siona Shimshi]], for example, developed her ceramic sculpture as a series of  archetypal human forms made of bare material.&lt;ref&gt;See: Siona Shimshi, "Anatomy of the Exhibition In Preparation for "Everybody is Sitting Down," in: Kaderut [Pottery], 10 (December 1984),  25-28; Siona Shimshi, Siona Shimshi: Preliminary Summary, 1987 (s.l: s.n., 1987). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nora and Naomi]] began to communicate with the sculptural field when they started to make use of motifs of journeys or nature images.  The works of [[Moshe Shek]] are somewhere on the spectrum between ceramics and sculpture, expressed in a sort of postmodern incarnation of the Israeli ceramic tradition.  The enormous pieces he created, which he called "containers" (1986), were decorated with simple designs that emphasized the natural colors of the material,&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Shak: Photographs, Ruti Ofek, ed. (Tefen: The Open Museum, Tefen and Omer Industrial Parks, 2006. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and these sculptures displayed stylized imaginary animals made of clay cylinders that emanated echoes of  "Canaanite" sculpture.  Other artists, such as David Morris&lt;!--not mentioned on the dab page--&gt; and [[Mark Yudell]], used images specifically in order to create a private mythological world, which reflected their personal experiences, along with a dollop of humor and irony.

Another aspect of the preoccupation with the biographical can be seen in the infiltration of religious motifs into Israeli art in general, and into Israeli ceramic art in particular.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, "Flight from the Myth and Towards It," Towards a Godless Myth (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Artists House, 1985), 56. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie Balian]], for example, an Armenian artist, from the 1970s geared her art towards monumental wall paintings made of glazed tiles.&lt;ref&gt;These works had a great impact in the 1980s and 1990s, and 3 murals were even mounted on the walls of Beit HaNassi [President's Residence] in Jerusalem (1986).  At the same time traditional Armenian ceramics flourished because of the research activity of Nurit Canaan-Kedar.  In 1982, for example, the Eretz Israel Museum hosted the exhibition "Armenian Pottery of Jerusalem."&lt;/ref&gt;  Her images were drawn from the Armenian ceramic tradition, with changes that were expressed in the design of the composition, which was transformed into the fantastic.

A similar trend can be seen in the work of Jewish ceramicists, whose Judaica works were no stranger to their culture of the material.  [https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%94 Abraham and Pnina Gofer], for example, in the 1970s and 1980s displayed Seder plates made using casting molds, with images done in the ethnographic style, decorated with colorful glazes.  In contrast, Meira Una, in the mid-1980s created a series of Chanukah lamps that combined images from Orthodox Judaism with architectural images.  Her work is typified by the use of untreated material (without clay slips or glazes), with scribbles or engraved writing, and with no polishing or finishing of the form.  All of these works emphasized the status of the personal and the preoccupation with ars poetica in ceramics and art.

At the same time, the most prominent ceramic artist who made use of Jewish motifs came from the field of art and painting.  In the mid-1980s [[Moshe Gershuni]] began to create what became known as "Jewish ceramics."&lt;ref&gt;In his work "The Blood of My Heart (1980), Gershuni used plates dotted with paint stains, although during this period he made use of glass paint.&lt;/ref&gt; Gershuni made use of ready made plates that he bought second hand.  On these he drew with ceramic paints for low-fire pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Among the artists Gershuni helped were Lidia Zavatsky (according to Gershuni himself) and Daniel Davis (according to Davis's wife, Aviva Bar-On).&lt;/ref&gt; The images that appeared on his pottery combined excerpts from prayers, swastikas, and Magen Davids, which also can be seen in his paintings from these years.&lt;ref&gt;See: Moshe Gershuni, "Jewish Ceramics," in: Sarah Breitberg Semel, Gershuni (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2010), 314; Itamar Levy, Moshe Gershuni: Works, 1987-1990 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1990), Plates 31-33, unnumbered. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitions of these works in 1988 at Bezalel and in 1990 at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art generated wide publicity.

===Body, fragments, and slivers of identity===
Clear signs of the coming transition from pottery to ceramic sculpture could be seen during the second half of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s.  A large number of ceramic artists began to adopt ideas from painting and sculpture in their art.  These ideas, in the eyes of these artists, conferred a new legitimacy on pottery and on the objects they created, both as an expression of their personal feelings and as an expression of ars poetica.

An example of the renewed relationship between sculpture and pottery can be seen in the works of artists on the border between traditional pottery and contemporary art.  [[Rayah Redlich]], for example, created large scale pots, which she presented as a renewed esthetic and cultural examination, and on which she used techniques of printing and painting "on the shards."  Many of these works were displayed on pedestals that were part of the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;See: Raya Redlich: Fallen Halos (Haifa: Haifa University, 2002), 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Daniel Davis]] used his potter's wheel to create large scale pots whose "shards" were then joined together in bundles by steel strips.  A group of about 70 of them appeared as part of "A Woman of the Pots," a performance and film created by his wife, [[Adina Bar-On]], in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;See: Alec Mishory, "Song of Praise to Mud," in: The way of Clay, 50 years of Israeli Ceramics (Ramat Gan: Ceramics Museum Aharon Kahana, 1998) (unnumbered pages).&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being used for musical percussion instruments, the pots pointed to themes like death and Judaism.  Another group that dealt with the imagery of the material and of pottery by means of a representative medium was the [[Zik Group]], whose works include a pot as a central image.  In the installation "Anarzik" (1997), for example, the group created, on the structure of a potter's wheel, a complex pot that underwent a transformation of its technology and its form before the eyes of the public.&lt;ref&gt;Einat Adi, "Anarzik," Studio 83, June (1987), 9-13. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent artist was [[Lidia Zavadsky]], who even served as the head of the Department of Ceramics and Glass Design at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem.  Like other artists, Zavadsky inserted sculpture into her work as an integral part of her postmodern approach.  Between the years 1992-1994 Zavadsky produced a series of pot-sculptures that turned out to be the highlight of her artistic output.  The pots were monumental in size, glazed in intense colors, and a combination of work on the potter's wheel and sculpture.  In spite of her themes of corporeality and death, the form and the internal relationships were the central artistic concern of Zavadsky's work.  Through them the artist grappled with European and Asian pottery traditions. These works received more artistic recognition than any ceramic works up to that time and were displayed as well in the Israel Museum.

Only at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st did ceramic artists begin to make more consistent use of installation art within ceramic art.&lt;ref&gt;In connection with this, one should note the work of Gideon Gechtman from the mid-1990s on ceramics and on the relationship between the original and the copy.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as [[Talia Tokatly]], [[Hadass Rosenberg Nir]], [[Shlomit Bauman]], [[Yael Atzmony]], [[Maya Muchawsky Parnas]], and others created installations that combined different media, such as sculpture, ceramics, video, etc.  In their works we see a combining of elements of their personal identity through the disassembly and assembly of objects saturated with political or personal history.

An opposing philosophy to this sculptural trend was the return to the pottery tradition of which one expression was the increasing adoption of porcelain as the material used on potter's wheels and in casting beginning in the 1990s. This happened both because this material began to arrive in Israel on a regular basis, and because artists began to be trained in the use of this material within the academic framework&lt;ref&gt;Among the teachers was Stephan Agai, who taught porcelain casting at Bezalel in the 1990s (See: Shir Mellr-Yamaguchi and Anat Turbowicz, White Matter: Contemporary Porcelain Sculpture (Hazorea: Wilfrid Israel Museum, 2015), 5).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as privately.&lt;ref&gt;Among the artists who have trained potters in workshops in the use of porcelain from the beginning of the 20th century are Irit Abba and Rani Gilat.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the artists who began to use porcelain on potter's wheels was [[Irit Abba]]. The use of this material sharpened her concentration on the form of the pot and allowed her to develop a deconstructionist concept of the pot, of her perception of pottery, and of her view of European culture. She emphasized the materiality of the pots and jugs she produced in the early 2000s by using slotting and chinking on their surface, by combining the porcelain with "paper clay,"&lt;ref&gt;Material mixed with paper.  This material serves as a stabilizer in the making of pots and is characterized by more sculptural flexibility.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian paste, and shavings, and by using intense colors.&lt;ref&gt;See Meira Yagid Haimovici, Irit Abba. The Wheel. Period. (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In other artists as well, such as [[Esther Beck]] and [[Shulamit Teiblum-Millar]], we can see this renewed interest in pottery and in the materials of ceramics to emphasize the work processes used in the creation of artistic objects.

In spite of massive training in the technology of design, the disappearance of the ceramics industry in Israel pushed artists, and particularly designers, to the creation of individual objects or of objects in small series, and sometimes in large ones, using hand casting techniques.  The most prominent of these artists are designers such as [[Ami Derech]], [[Dov Ganchrow]], and [[Jonathan Hopp]].

'''Marge Green''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Pat Coombs]].&lt;ref name="pat4"&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,3604,723345,00.html Pat Coombs]", ''[[The Guardian]]''. URL last accessed on 2007-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt; from 9 May 1989 to 8 February 1990. Introduced in 1989, elderly Marge is scripted as comical and timid. The character was one of many to be axed in 1990 when [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]] took over the role as executive producer from her introducer [[Mike Gibbon]].

==Storylines==
Marge is first seen in May 1989 as a friend of [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]) and [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]). Marge works at the Bed &amp; Breakfast as a cleaner, first for (the unseen) Doris then for [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). When poor health forces [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) to give up working at the [[launderette]], Marge works there in her place for a few months, but always succeeds in muddling up the service washes. Marge is an elderly [[spinster]] and as well as her day job cleaning she also holds the position of [[Brown Owl (disambiguation)|Brown Owl]] for the unruly [[Walford]] [[Brownies (Girl Guides)|Brownies]] until [[Mo Butcher]] ([[Edna Doré]]) relieves her of her duties. Mo's tenure is brief, however, as she is sacked for lying about her age.

Marge is timid and a bit of a soft-touch and tends to be bossed around by the more domineering personalities on the square, such as her friend Mo. Marge lives at 93 Victoria Road and devotes her life to caring for her sickly 93-year-old mother. This is a massive strain on her, particularly when her mother's health suddenly deteriorates after a second [[stroke]] in December 1989. Noticing that Marge is becoming exhausted with the palliative care of her mother, her friends, Dot, Ethel and Mo, take her on holiday to [[Clacton]] where they all take part in a dancing competition. Marge attracts the attention of a senior bachelor, Mr Conroy, but she has led a sheltered life and is too shy to allow the romance to develop. Nevertheless, Mr Conroy persists and ends up proposing, which Marge regretfully turns down because of her commitment to her mother. Soon after, however, Marge receives news that her mother has died and she subsequently decides to accept Mr Conroy's proposal. Unfortunately for Marge, he has already departed, so she returns to Walford alone.

Although Marge is devastated to lose her mother, her friends help her through it and she eventually comes to look forward to a future where she can concentrate on her own needs instead of caring for others. However, the following year, Marge's cousin Fred arrives in Walford and cons her into becoming his invalid mother's companion on a [[cruise ship]]. Despite Mo warning her against it, Marge feels obligated to care for her sick relative and in February 1990, she leaves Walford.

==Creation and development==
Writer [[Colin Brake]] has suggested that 1989 was a year of big change for ''EastEnders'', both behind the cameras and in front of them. Original production designer Keith Harris left the show, and co-creators [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]] both decided that the time had come to move on too; their final contribution coincided with the exit of one of ''EastEnders''' most successful characters, [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]).&lt;ref name="first10years"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Mike Gibbon]] was given the task of running the show and he enlisted the most experienced writers to take over the storylining of the programme, including Charlie Humphreys, Jane Hollowood and [[Tony McHale]].&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

According to Brake, the departure of two of the soap's most popular characters, Den and [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]), had left a void in the programme, which needed to be filled.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; In addition, several other long-running characters left the show that year including two original cast members, [[Sue Osman|Sue]] and [[Ali Osman]] ([[Sandy Ratcliff]] and [[Nejdet Salih]]) and their family; [[Donna Ludlow]] ([[Matilda Ziegler]]); [[Carmel Jackson]] ([[Judith Jacob]]) and [[Colin Russell (EastEnders)|Colin Russell]] ([[Michael Cashman]]). Brake has indicated that the production team decided that 1989 was to be a year of change in Walford, commenting, "it was almost as if Walford itself was making a fresh start".&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

At the time, the programme had come under criticism in the British media for being too [[Depression (mood)|depressing]], and according to Brake, the programme makers were determined to change this.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; In 1989 there was a deliberate attempt to increase the lighter, more comic aspects of life in [[Albert Square]]. This led to the introduction of some characters who were deliberately conceived as comic or light-hearted.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Such characters included [[Julie Cooper (EastEnders)|Julie Cooper]] ([[Louise Plowright]]); [[Trevor Short]] ([[Phil McDermott]]), the "village idiot", and his friend, northern heartbreaker [[Paul Priestly]] ([[Mark Thrippleton]]); wheeler-dealer [[Vince Johnson]] (Hepburn Graham); [[Laurie Bates]] ([[Gary Powell (actor)|Gary Powell]]), who became [[Pete Beale]]'s ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]) sparring partner and Marge Green played by veteran comedy actress [[Pat Coombs]].&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

Brake describes Marge as a "well-meaning, slightly batty older lady" who he said worked well in partnership with the much tougher older character [[Mo Butcher]] ([[Edna Dore]]).&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Marge has been described by author Hilary Kingsley as an innocent spinster "who yearns for love and deserves it." Referring to the character's role as Walford Brownie's Brown Owl, Kingsley says, "She was always more of a mouse than an owl, a funny, easily flustered frump who was scared of men and the modern world because she'd hidden away from both for most of her life [...] Poor Marge was put upon by her domineering [ninety]-three-year-old mother [...] Friendless, except for Tibby, her mother's cat [...]"&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|The EastEnders Handbook]] |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=0685529576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing her backstory, Kingsley said, "In her youth, she was briefly engaged to a soldier but he married her best friend."&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; Coombs, described by Kingsley as one of Britain's best comedy actresses, was already a known comedy actress in the UK and reportedly "relished" the role.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt;

Brake suggests that humour was an important element in ''EastEnders''' storylines during 1989, with a greater amount of slapstick and light comedy than ever before. He has classed 1989's changes  as a brave experiment, and has suggested that while some found this period of ''EastEnders'' entertaining, many other viewers felt that the comedy stretched the programme's credibility somewhat.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Although the programme still covered many issues in 1989, such as [[domestic violence]], drugs, [[rape]] and [[racism]], Brake reflected that the new emphasis on a more balanced mix between "light and heavy storylines" gave the illusion that the show had lost a "certain edge".&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

By the end of the year, ''EastEnders'' had acquired a new executive producer, [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], who had previously been a successful producer on [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s ''[[The Bill]]''. Brake has suggested that Ferguson was responsible for bringing in a new sense of vitality, and creating a programme that was more in touch with the real world than it had been over the last year.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; A new era began in 1990 with the introduction of the Mitchell brothers, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), successful characters who would go on to dominate the soap thereafter. As the new production machine cleared the way for new characters and a new direction, a number of characters were axed from the show at the start of the year.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Among them was Marge, as well as many other characters that had been introduced to the show in 1989. By March 1990 they had all gone. Brake has said that Pat Coombs was upset to be leaving the programme so soon, but with the show's new direction there was no place for characters "whose prime function was to be comic relief".&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

== Reception ==
According to Brake, the storyline involving Marge and the unruly Brownies was intended to be fun, but references to Brownies behaving badly caused great offence to the Brownie movement, and an official complaint was made and upheld. The broadcasting commission said the ''EastEnders'' Brownie episodes "came near to parody," were unfair to the Brownies and harmed the [[Girl Guides]]' image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/471606831.html?dids=471606831:471606831&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+12%2C+1990&amp;author=Michael+Hanlon+Toronto+Star&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Poll+tax+blamed+for+pushing+Britons+into+debt&amp;pqatl=google|title=Poll tax blamed for pushing Britons into debt|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=12 March 1990|accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC had to make a public apology for the misinterpretation of the movement.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Brake has suggested that the mishap was a "salutary lesson to those [...] in the script department to be very vigilant in ensuring, as far as possible, that no group or individual was offended by an unintentional slight in a script."&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

A '''music library''' contains music-related materials for [[patron use]].  Collections may also include non-print materials, such as digitized music scores or [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio recording]]s.  Use of such materials may be limited to specific patron groups, especially in private academic institutions.  Music library print collections include dictionaries and encyclopedias, indexes and directories, [[Sheet music|printed music]], music serials, bibliographies, and other music literature.

==Types==
Traditionally, there are four types of '''music libraries''':

#Those developed to support departments of music in university or college settings;
#Those developed to support conservatories and schools of music;
#Those housed within public libraries;
#Those developed as independent libraries or archives supporting music organizations.

==Musical instrument library==
A musical instrument library lends or shares [[musical instruments]]. Examples can be found in [[Canada]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joesmill.wordpress.com/ |title=Joe's M.I.L.L. |author= |location=Kingston, Ontario, Canada |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/programs/metromorning/musical-library-1.3524976 |title=Toronto Public Library creates city's 1st musical instrument lending program |work=CBC |date=7 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perth, Australia]];&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.instrumentlenders.com Instrument Lenders Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611084125/http://instrumentlenders.com/ |date=2013-06-11 }} ... an instrument lending library, situated in Perth County, which supplies instruments mainly to youth at no cost for up to 6 months." {{citation |title=Voices of Youth |author=Perth County Social Research and Planning Council |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://themusary.com/ The Musary], a Hamilton-based nonprofit "lending library" of musical instruments." {{citation |title=Sharing the music: in honor of a late Hamilton resident, lending library brings instruments to students at the Beverly School for the Deaf |author=James Sullivan |date= 15 Dec 2011 |work=Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The South Shore Folk Music Club of Kingston, Massachusetts, maintains an instrument lending library. {{citation |title=For club, it's been 20 years strumming |author=Judith Montminy |date=27 Sep 1998 |work=Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://bark.cwmars.org/eg/opac/record/2715816 |author=Sheffield Bushnell-Sage Library |title=Ukulele |publisher=CW/MARS |location=Massachusetts |accessdate=Oct 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oddmusicuc.wordpress.com/instrumentarium-catalogue/ |title=Oddmusic Instrumentarium |location=Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, US |accessdate=3 May 2012|date=2010-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.libraryasincubatorproject.org/?p=15789 |title=Guitar Lending Collection at Licking County Library |date= December 2014 |work=Library as Incubator Project |location=USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington (state)|Washington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/us/breaking-out-of-the-library-mold-in-boston-and-beyond.html |title=Breaking Out of the Library Mold, in Boston and Beyond |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |newspaper=New York Times |last1=Seelye |first1=Katharine Q. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://rootnotemusicshop.com/instrumentlibrary/ New Paltz, New York]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2016/09/08/music-for-the-masses-the-new-paltz-instrument-library/|title=Music for the masses: The New Paltz instrument library|last=Ward|first=Terence P.|website=Hudson Valley One|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States.

[[File:Naked Angels Logo.png|thumb|right|Naked Angels Logo]]

'''Naked Angels''' is an [[Theater in the United States|American]] [[theater]] company founded in 1986 and based in [[New York City]]. It was named after [[John Tytell]]'s book about the Beat Generation, ''[[Naked Angels]]''. It is notable for having produced plays on controversial social topics, such as the critically acclaimed Broadway transfer ''[[Next Fall (play)|Next Fall]]'', and for featuring many [[Hollywood]] stars.

Naked Angels was originally based out in a former picture-frame factory on West 17th Street in [[Manhattan]]. It "soon became the 'it' place for a generation of about-to-be famous young actors and playwrights."&lt;ref name="partyover" /&gt;

One of the company's longtime efforts is "The Issues Project", featuring plays or groups of plays focusing on socially relevant issues, often in collaboration with organizations like [[Amnesty International]], The [[Center for American Progress]], Project A.L.S. and The Culture Project. Also known are the group's long-running [http://www.nakedangels.com/development-programs/ "Tuesdays@9"] [[cold reading (theatrical)|cold reading]] series, where new playwrights, novelists, short-story writers, and actors get together to review work that is still being written.

In 2005, the company partnered with Fox Broadcasting Company to produce Naked TV, an annual showcase of short plays by emerging playwrights. Based on these stagings, Fox executives chose to turn some of the one-act plays into pilot scripts for the primetime network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Lee|title=Fox Gets 'Naked'|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/fox-gets-naked/|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=Backstage|date=April 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adalian|first1=Joseph|title=Network bares 'Naked TV' search for material|url=https://variety.com/2004/scene/markets-festivals/fox-stalks-writers-1117900565/|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=Variety|date=February 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lacob|first1=Jace|title=Television That's a Little More "Naked"|url=http://www.televisionaryblog.com/2006/05/television-thats-little-more-naked.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=BuzzFeed|date=May 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for "glamorous parties" and "provocative productions", after the first decade the group seemed to have lost the focus on theater. In 1995 the venue on 17th Street (often called "The Place") was closed and by that time many of the early members had gone on to fame in [[Hollywood]] or on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref name="partyover" /&gt;

The '''New York Watercolor Society''', also known as the '''New York Water Color Society''', was a "short-lived" organization founded in 1850 by in part by [[John William Hill]]. It led to the founding of the [[American Watercolor Society]] in 1866.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan M. Marter|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&amp;pg=RA4-PA507|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533579-8|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was an early watercolor organization, following the 1804 establishment of the first Watercolor Society in England called the Society of Painters in Water Colours, the present day renamed [[Royal Watercolour Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adelheid M.

The name of the organization was sometimes confused with the [[New York Watercolor Club]].

{{Refimprove|date=June 2011}}
'''Playwrights Guild of Canada''' (PGC) is a registered national arts service association mandated to advance the creative rights and interests of professional Canadian [[playwright]]s, promote Canadian plays nationally and internationally, and foster an active, evolving community of writers for the stage.&lt;ref name="PGC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.playwrightscanada.com |title= Playwrights Guild of Canada |publisher= Playwrights Guild of Canada|accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1972 as the Playwrights Co-op.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/playwrights-guild-of-canada/ |title= Playwrights Guild of Canada, The |publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose was to publish and distribute scripts to encourage more productions of Canadian plays. Since then, it has grown and now provides programs and services for playwrights across the country, and now includes more than 900 playwrights. PGC provides promotional and advocacy programs and services for the creative rights of [[Canada|Canadian]] playwrights.

Through its independently run subsidiary, [[Playwrights Canada Press]], which was established in 2002, PGC is a primary source for unpublished Canadian plays, as well as information regarding [[performance right]]s.&lt;ref name="PGC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt;

To help support and advance Canadian playwriting, PGC offers the following services to its members:
* Publication of ''CanScene'', PGC's monthly newsletter, which includes calls for submissions, jobs and other opportunities;
* Promotion of Canadian playwrights via print publications, the PGC website, social media networks, and other means;
* Advertising, selling, and distributing published and unpublished plays;
* Administering amateur production rights;
* Facilitating the [[Canada Council]] Readings Program, which creates opportunities for organizations such as universities, libraries and community groups to invite Canadian playwrights to read in public venues by paying the playwright's reading fees and subsidizing their travel expenses;
* Professional development workshops;
* And overseeing member enrollment in the [https://www.afbs.ca/ AFBS] RRSP Investment Plan and the Writer's Coalition Insurance Program.

PGC also publishes ''CanRevue'', an electronic catalogue of Canadian Copyscript plays, on a monthly timetable. ''CanRevue'' promotes new Canadian plays and is sometimes released as a special edition pertaining to genre or geographical region. In 2011, PGC added a section within ''CanRevue'' entitled "Stage Ready". This is intended to narrow the gap between a written work and a production, and allows members to send PGC plays that have not yet been produced, but are ready to be promoted for the stage. ''CanRevue'' is sent out to over two hundred theatres (both professional and amateur) and to schools across Canada.

==History==
PGC had its origins in a meeting held in 1971 by the Canada Council's theatre officer, David Gardner, with [[Carol Bolt]], [[Tom Hendry]], and [[Len Peterson]] to discuss issues affecting [[English Canadian]] playwrights.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt; Those present at the meeting determined that there was a need for a publishing house for Canadian plays. Following the meeting, Bolt, Hendry and Peterson established the Toronto Playwrights Circle to obtain funding for the project.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt; This led to the founding of the Playwrights Co-op of Canada in the following year, for the purpose of publishing and distributing plays written by Canadian playwrights.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt; In 1979, the Playwrights Co-op changed its name to Playwrights Canada, Inc.

In 1977, the Guild of Canadian Playwrights formed to advocate on behalf of playwrights and to lobby for suitable working conditions for Canadian playwrights. In 1982, the Guild of Canadian Playwrights and Playwrights Canada, Inc. merged to form the Playwrights Union of Canada. In 2002, the organization changed its name to the Playwrights Guild of Canada.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt; That same year, it established its publishing arm, the Playwrights Canada Press.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt;

The Playwrights Guild of Canada is a registered [[Charitable organziations (Canada)|charitable organization]]. In 1986, PGC created the Canadian Drama Foundation (formerly known as the Foundation for Recognition of Excellence in Drama)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadahelps.org/CharityProfilePage.aspx?CharityID=s67275&lt;/ref&gt; as its charitable arm. Part of its funding comes from the [[Canada Council]], the [[Ontario Arts Council]], Ontario Ministry of Culture, and the City of [[Toronto]] through the Toronto Arts Council.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The Guild has a Women's Caucus, which awards the "Bra D'Or" ("Golden Bra") for supporting the work of female playwrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.straight.com/article-330069/vancouver/touchstone-theatres-katrina-dunn-feted-being-femalefriendly |title=Touchstone Theatre's Katrina Dunn feted for being female-friendly |date=2010-06-21 |publisher=The Georgia Straight |accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PGC celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2012 with a series of special events, such as a week-long play reading series in May that included Maja Ardal, Drew Hayden Taylor, Hannah Moscovitch, Brad Fraser, and Marcia Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://quillandquire.com/book-news/2012/05/01/playwrights-guild-of-canada-celebrates-40-years-with-reading-series/|title=Playwrights Guild of Canada celebrates 40 years with reading series {{!}} Quill and Quire|date=2012-05-01|work=Quill and Quire|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, PGC opened the Canadian Play Outlet (CPO) at 401 Richmond Street West, a physical bookstore with a selection of over 2000 published and unpublished plays by Canadian playwrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadianplayoutlet.com/|title=Canadian Play Outlet|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Canadian Play Outlet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

PGC has an annual awards competition with several categories: Lifetime Membership, Honorary Membership, Post-Secondary Competition, the Bra D'Or Award, Carol Bolt Award for Playwrights, Stage West Pechet Family Comedy Award, and [[Stage West Pechet Family Musical Award]]. The awards were recently named the Tom Hendry Awards after Tom Hendry, a founding member of PGC who died in 2012. The awards carry generous cash prizes and winners are recognized in a ceremony occurring in the fall each year. Deadlines for the awards are April 30 and May 31.

As in previous years, in the future the awards ceremony will continue to forge relationships with other arts organizations and corporate sponsors, celebrating excellence in Canadian playwriting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2855">'''Process-centered design''' ('''PCD''') is a [[design|design methodology]], which proposes a business centric approach for designing [[user interfaces]]. Because of the multi-stage business analysis steps involved right from the beginning of the PCD life cycle, it is believed to achieve the highest levels of [[Business/IT alignment|business-IT alignment]] that is possible through UI.

== Purpose ==
This method is aimed at enterprise applications where there is a business process involved. Unlike content oriented systems such as websites or portals, enterprise applications are built to enable a company's business processes. Enterprise applications often have a clear business goal and a set of specific objectives like- improve [[Productivity|employee productivity]], increase [[Efficiency ratio|business performance]] by a certain percent, etc.

== Comparison between other popular UI design methods ==
Although there are proven UI design methodologies (like the most popular "[[user-centered design]]", which helps design highly Usable Interfaces), PCD differentiates itself by precisely catering to business process intensive software which has not been the case with other UI design methodologies.

== Process-UI alignment ==
Process-UI alignment is a component of PCD, which ensures tight alignment between the business process and the enterprise application being developed. &lt;ref name="aja"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alignjournal.com/index.cfm?section=article&amp;aid=446|title=Process-User Interface Alignment: New Value From a New Level of Alignment|publisher=Align Journal|date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; UI design activities are affected by PCD. 

For example: A [[call center]] software used by a [[customer support]] agent, if designed for high process-UI alignment will achieve tremendous agent productivity improvement and call center performance; which is not likely to be seen if it were designed only for user satisfaction, ease of use, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1995">[[File:Hadji Ali demonstrating controlled regurgitation Crisco edit.jpg|thumb|[[Hadji Ali]], known for numerous acts of regurgitation]]
A '''professional regurgitator''' is an entertainer whose act consists of [[swallowing]] and [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitating]] various unusual objects. The objects may consist of anything from live animals (live mice: The Great Waldo),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehumanmarvels.com/the-great-waldo-the-regurgitating-geek/|title=Great Waldo act|website=Thehumanmarvels.com|accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to light bulbs, billiard balls ([[Stevie Starr]]) and [[kerosene]] ([[Hadji Ali]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damninteresting.com/hadji-ali-and-the-regurgitators|title=Hadji Ali act|website=Damninteresting.com|accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some magicians perform regurgitation as part of their act (for instance, [[Harry Houdini]]), but professional regurgitators may perform regurgitation exclusively. In some cases there is debate as to whether demonstrations are true feats of regurgitation or "tricks". For example, [[Stevie Starr]] as part of his performance has swallowed an unsolved [[Rubik's Cube]], then regurgitated a solved cube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2006/2/27/the-regurgitator-shocks-amazes-overjoys/|title=Swarthmore Daily Gazette account of Starr's act including Rubik's cube trick|website=Daily.swarthmore.edu|accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steviestarr.com/stevie_starrs_regurgitation_act.php|title=Description of act including Rubiks cube trick |website=StevieStarr.com|accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psycho-biddy''' is a colloquial term for a subgenre of the [[horror film|horror]]/[[thriller film|thriller movie]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://flavorwire.com/335871/the-scariest-psycho-biddies-in-cinema] ''Nastasi, Alison. "The Scariest Psycho Biddies in Cinema." Flavorwire. Oct. 9, 2012.''&lt;/ref&gt; that features a formerly-glamorous older woman who has become mentally unbalanced and terrorizes those around her. The genre officially began in 1962 with the film ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (though it had some antecedents) and lasted through the mid-1970s. It has also been referred to by the terms '''Grande Dame Guignol''', '''hagsploitation''' and '''hag horror'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelley |first=Peter |date=September 15, 2009 |title=Grande Dame Guignol Cinema: A History of Hag Horror from "Baby Jane" to "Mother" |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Grande_Dame_Guignol_Cinema.html?id=HKYqAQAAIAAJ |location=Jefferson, North Carolina and London |publisher=McFarland and Company, Inc. |page= |isbn=978-0786445691 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renata Adler]], in her ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review for the 1968 film ''[[The Anniversary (1968 film)|The Anniversary]]'', referred to the genre as "the Terrifying Older Actress Filicidal Mummy genre."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9905E0DE1131E034BC4951DFB5668383679EDE ''New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition, themes and influences==
The subgenre features a mentally unstable, dangerous, or insane woman of advanced years with a somewhat glamorous past, living a life of relative wealth. In some cases, the woman may be in jeopardy of some sort, with another party attempting to drive her to mental instability. Often (but not always), there are two older women pitted against one another in a life-or-death struggle, usually the result of bitter hatreds, jealousies, or rivalries that have percolated over the course of, not years, but decades. These combatants are often blood-relatives. The character is often brought to life in an over-the-top, grotesque fashion, emphasizing the unglamorous process of aging and eventual death. Characters are often seen pining for lost youth and glory, trapped by their idealized memories of their childhood, or younger days, and the trauma of a past episode that haunts them.

This subgenre includes elements of many other genres, including [[gothic fiction|gothic]], [[Grand Guignol]], [[black comedy]], [[psychodrama]], [[melodrama]], [[revenge]], [[camp (style)|camp]] and even the [[musical film|musical]]. [[Science fiction]] and [[Western (genre)|Western]] films have also been part of the genre.

==History==
{{Section OR|date=December 2010}}
The genre began in [[1962 in film|1962]] with ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' directed by [[Robert Aldrich]]. ''What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?'' bolstered the flagging careers of its [[movie star|stars]], [[Bette Davis]] as [[Baby Jane Hudson]] and [[Joan Crawford]] as [[Blanche Hudson]]. The [[1950 in film|1950]] [[Billy Wilder]] classic ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' shares thematic similarities (their respective central characters both psychotically deranged formerly-glamorous older women) with ''What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?'' and can be seen as a precursor to the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Peter (2009) ''Grande Dame Guignol Cinema'' McFarland and Company, Inc. Publishers, Jefferson, North Carolina and London&lt;/ref&gt;

''Baby Jane'' set many trends and more-or-less defined the genre: the theatrical performance, the trappings of wealth and Hollywood, and psychologically complex melodrama. Jane goes quite insane over the course of the movie, torturing her crippled sister and venting long-pent up hostilities and guilt. At the end of the film, Blanche makes a confession which details and admits of her own complicity in the whole affair. The film was quite successful, garnering [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including one for Davis.

Crawford then starred in director and producer [[William Castle]]'s ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]) as Lucy Harbin, the accused axe-murderer of her husband and his mistress, who is released from the [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]] for the [[criminally insane]] after 20 years to be reunited with her beloved daughter and other friends. When a new string of axe-murders begins, it is naturally assumed that it is Lucy committing them.

The two actresses were reunited again with director Robert Aldrich for a ''Baby Jane'' "follow-up", ''[[Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964), despite a hyped, somewhat exaggerated feud. But genuine mutual dislike between the two actresses led to Crawford bowing out. She was replaced by [[Olivia de Havilland]], who knew how to get along with Davis. Veteran actresses [[Agnes Moorehead]] and [[Mary Astor]] also appeared in the film.

In ''Charlotte'', Davis was not only the one going insane, but was the "officially" sympathetic character, who is [[gaslighting|gaslit]] by her cousin (De Havilland) and her doctor, the cousin's lover ([[Joseph Cotten]]). In this movie, Davis' character is again haunted by guilt, though this time the ante is upped: instead of believing herself responsible for a crippling, she believes she is responsible for the murder of her lover. ''Charlotte'' is one of the most successful examples of the genre, and is noted for using [[Southern Gothic]] atmosphere.

[[Mad Magazine|''Mad'' Magazine]] poked fun at the genre in 1966 with a movie musical satire entitled "Hack, Hack Sweet Has-Been-or Whatever Happened to Good Taste?"&lt;ref&gt;''"Hack, Hack Sweet Has-Been -or Whatever Happened to Good Taste?"'' Written by Mort Drucker, Illustrated by Larry Siegel. ''MAD'' Magazine, Issue No. 100, January 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable films==
[[File:What's the Matter With Helen Shelley Winters 1971.jpg|thumb|Shelley Winters in ''[[What's the Matter with Helen?]]'' (1971)]]
Wealth is a more prominent theme than revenge in ''[[What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]). Claire Marrable ([[Geraldine Page]]), a socialite, finds herself (apparently) penniless when her husband dies. She then begins hiring financially independent older cleaning women, murdering them, taking their savings and planting the corpses in her garden. The corpses apparently make the ground quite fertile, and it's not until the third cleaning woman drops out of sight that someone ([[Ruth Gordon]]) begins to suspect something is amiss. Gordon applies to be Page's maid to figure out what happened to her friend, the third maid. The movie has a certain status as a [[cult film|cult classic]], and is fairly well-regarded.

''[[What's the Matter with Helen?]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]) features two older women, Helen Hill ([[Shelley Winters]]) and Adelle Bruckner ([[Debbie Reynolds]]), who move out to Hollywood during the heyday of [[Shirley Temple]]. Their sons have gone to prison for a [[Leopold and Loeb]]-like murder and the two mothers are on the run from a man who threatens to kill them for revenge. Helen, an increasingly unstable and violent religious [[religious fanaticism|fanatic]] and repressed [[Lesbianism|lesbian]], may have murdered her husband years before (and possibly led to her son's criminal behavior). Helen's increasing obsession with Adelle, her roommate, leads to a graphically violent climax, which would recur in future excursions into the genre.

''[[Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?]]'' (1971) has only one older woman, Mrs. Rosie Forrest, a.k.a. Auntie Roo (Shelley Winters), featured prominently in the cast. A young orphan becomes a surrogate in the troubled woman's mind for her own long-dead daughter. Roo visits the mummified remains in her daughter's bedroom. The themes of deep-seated past guilt and youth are explored. The story is a variant of the [[Hansel and Gretel]] theme; however, unlike the witch in the story, Roo is seriously unstable, as well as subject to con-artist clairvoyants and blackmailing servants. She tries to keep the young orphan girl with her, as the girl reminds her of her daughter, but the girl and her brother fight back, and are quite cunning, having stolen, by the film's end, the woman's valuable jewelry. Roo dies in a fire the children set while trying to escape.

Other examples of the genre are the 1965 UK films ''[[The Nanny (1965 film)|The Nanny]]'', starring [[Bette Davis]] in the lead role as the said nanny, and ''[[Fanatic (film)|Fanatic]]'' with [[Tallulah Bankhead]], released in the US as ''Die! Die! My Darling''.

Later films like ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'' (1981) and ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'' (2000) also contain elements of the psycho-biddy genre in their respective portrayals of aged women who descend into mental instability.

''Referent des Ministers'' [[Karl Hanke]] is in the background (1937).]]
The '''Reich Chamber of Culture''' ('''''Reichskulturkammer''''') was a [[government agency]] in [[Nazi Germany]]. It was established by law on 22 September 1933 in the course of the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process at the instigation of Reich Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] as a professional organization of all German creative artists.&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005207|title=Culture in the Third Reich: Overview|date=June 10, 2013|work=[[Holocaust Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defying the competing ambitions of the [[German Labour Front]] (DAF) under Goebbels' rival [[Robert Ley]], it was meant to gain control over the entire cultural life in Germany creating and promoting Aryan art consistent with [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideals.

Every artist had to apply for membership on presentation of an [[Aryan certificate]]. A rejected inscription ''de facto'' resulted in an occupational ban.

== Structure and organisation ==
The RKK was affiliated with the [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] with its seat on [[Wilhelmplatz]] in [[Berlin]]. Headed by Goebbels himself, a [[Secretary of state|state secretary]] of his ministry served as vice president:
[[File:Reichsmusikkammer1001.jpg|upright|thumb|The 1935 [[Reichsmusikkammer|Reich Chamber of Music]] decree to the Berlin musician Werner Liebenthal dictating the immediate cessation of his professional activity.]]
*[[Walther Funk]] (1933–1938)
*[[Karl Hanke]] (1938–1941)
*Leopold Gutterer (1941–1944)
*[[Werner Naumann]] (1944–1945)
''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]'' officer [[Hans Hinkel]] was one of the officers in charge of the chamber and Goebbels' special commissioner for the removal of [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jews]] from German cultural life.

Different subdivisions of the RKK dealt with [[Reichsmusikkammer|music]], visual arts, [[Reichsfilmkammer|film]], architecture, and literature, organized in seven departments:
*''[[Reichsfilmkammer]]'', headed by [[Carl Froelich]] from 1939
*''[[Reichsmusikkammer]]'', headed by [[Richard Strauss]], from 1935 by [[Peter Raabe]]
*''Reichskammer der bildenden Künste'' ("Reich Chamber of Fine Arts") ([[:de:Reichskammer der bildenden Künste|de]]), headed by [[Eugen Hönig]] from 1933, by [[Adolf Ziegler]] from 1936, and by [[Wilhelm Kreis]] from 1943
*''Reichstheaterkammer'', headed by [[Rainer Schlösser]] 1935–1938, by [[Paul Hartmann (actor)|Paul Hartmann]] from 1942
*''Reichsschrifttumskammer'', headed by [[Hans-Friedrich Blunck]], from 1935 by [[Hanns Johst]]
*''Reichspressekammer'', headed by [[Max Amann]]
*''Reichsrundfunkkammer'' (tasks assigned to ''[[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]]'' in 1939)

The RKK was ultimately dissolved and its assets confiscated by Law no. 2 (October 10, 1945) of the [[Allied Control Council]]. Footage and archives material are kept by the [[German Federal Archives]] (''Bundesarchiv'') and the [[Berlin Document Center]].

== Degenerate art ==
[[File:Ausstellung entartete kunst 1937.jpg|thumb|upright|Goebbels visits the 1938 ''Entartete Kunst'' exhibition in Berlin]]
The RKK played a significant role in the Nazi oppression of [[Modern art]], defamed as "[[Cultural Bolshevism]]". One notable project of the ''Bildende Künste'' (Fine Arts) division under Adolf Ziegler was the ''[[Degenerate Art Exhibition|Entartete Kunst]]'' exhibition, of works deemed "[[Degenerate Art|degenerate]]."&lt;ref name="Disseminating"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007519|title=Culture in the Third Reich: Disseminating the Nazi Worldview|date=June 10, 2013|work=[[Holocaust Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opened in July 1937 at the [[Hofgarten (Munich)|Hofgarten]] in [[Munich]], touring exhibitions were held from 1938 to 1941 in several major German cities such as Berlin, [[Leipzig]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Salzburg]], and [[Hamburg]]. Attendance was measured in the millions (perhaps largely because entrance was free), and the so-called degenerate art may have been more popular with the public than the Nazis anticipated. Goebbels had supported German [[expressionist]]s until Hitler intervened and expressed his disgust at artists such as [[Max Liebermann]] and [[Emil Nolde]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4881">The '''Royal Dramatic College''' was a home for retired actors in [[Woking]], England; it was opened by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) in 1865, and closed because of financial difficulty in 1877.

==Origins of the College==
On 21 July 1858, at the [[Princess's Theatre, London]], there was a well-attended meeting, chaired by the actor [[Charles Kean]], to discuss the feasibility of providing [[almshouses]] for retired actors. [[Charles Dickens]] and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] were among those present. As a result of the meeting a trust was formed, and a suitable site for the proposed building was found, in [[Woking]] where a ten-acre site in Maybury Common was purchased from the [[London Necropolis Company]] for £750.&lt;ref name=leitner/&gt;&lt;ref name=foulkes&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kfAKKd3oxI8C&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=royal+dramatic+college Page 42] ''Church and Stage in Victorian England'', by Richard Foulkes, accessed 15 Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=M. Glen|last=Wilson|id=15203|title=Kean, Charles John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:John W. Anson.JPG|thumb|upright|John W. Anson, Secretary of the Royal Dramatic College]]
This followed the inauguration, in June 1858, of a burial ground for actors, in an acre purchased from the London Necropolis Company in Woking. This site was selected by [[John W. Anson]], Secretary of the Dramatic, Equestrian and Musical Sick Fund, which provided members with financial help when ill and a decent burial. Actors could not otherwise rely on such things: a report of the inauguration of the burial ground commented "Before this was obtained, a parish funeral, or cast among strangers, too frequently in from 6-16 inches of water, was the fate of many." Anson later became Secretary of the college.&lt;ref name=foulkes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theirvingsociety.org.uk/No36.pdf ''The Actors' Acre: A Theatrical Burial Ground'', by Jenni Bisset] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213210845/http://www.theirvingsociety.org.uk/No36.pdf |date=2013-12-13 }} The Irving Society Newsletter No 36 - July 2006, accessed 20 Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1871 Census shows Anson was Secretary of the college.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1858, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] became patron. On 9 June 1860 he travelled to Woking on a special train and laid the foundation stone of the building.&lt;ref name=leitner/&gt;&lt;ref name=foulkes/&gt;

==Opening==
After the death of Prince Albert, his son the Prince of Wales, later [[Edward VII]], became patron. On 5 June 1865 he officially opened the College. The building, designed by [[Thomas Roger Smith|T. R. Smith]], had a central hall and two wings, each containing several self-contained "houses".&lt;ref name=leitner/&gt;&lt;ref name=foulkes/&gt;

[[File:Thomas Potter Cooke Baugniet.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The actor Thomas Cooke in 1843]]
The actor [[Thomas Cooke (actor)|Thomas Cooke]] gave much financial support. One of his last appearances, at Covent Garden in 1860, was for the benefit of the College. He died in 1864, and left £2000 to the College to be invested to provide a prize for "the best Drama on a Nautical or National subject", and £1000 to fund an annual dinner for the College. A. R. Slous's ''True to the Core: a Story of the Armada'' won the first drama prize and was performed on 8 Sept 1866 at the [[Surrey Theatre]]. J. S. Dilley and [[James Albery]]'s ''The Mate of the Mountjoy'', which was unperformed, won in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Michael|last=Slater|id=6184|title=Cooke, Thomas Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1870 the College was in financial difficulties; the building costs had been higher than expected and the running costs were high. Thomas Cooke's benefaction was insufficient and there was little public interest. In November 1877 the trustees decided to close the college.&lt;ref name=leitner/&gt;&lt;ref name=maybury/&gt;

==Later history of the building==
The building was sold in 1884 to [[G. W. Leitner]] for a proposed [[Oriental Institute, Woking|Oriental Institute]]. The Institute closed after Leitner's death in 1899, and the building became a factory for aircraft and motorcycle manufacturer [[Martinsyde]] and later for James Walker Ltd. The building was demolished in the 1990s, and the Lion Retail Park now stands on the site (coordinates {{coord|51|19|24|N |0|32|35|W|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline}}).&lt;ref name=leitner&gt;[http://www.wokingmuslim.org/pers/dr_leitner.htm Dr. Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner] The Woking Muslim Mission, accessed 15 Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maybury&gt;[http://www.housesinwoking.com/Webpage/132/History-of-Maybury History of Maybury] housesinwoking.com, accessed 17 Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-18906539 Woking Royal Dramatic College celebrated in exhibition] BBC News (20 July 2012), accessed 15 Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photograph of paper book sculpture aka the 'poetree'.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The first sculpture to be found, known as the 'poetree']]
The '''Scottish book sculptures''' are a group of book sculptures that were contrived to be "found" in Scotland between 2011 and 2013. The sculptures are on topics mostly concerning Scottish literature and poetry, and are made out of old books by an anonymous female paper sculptor.

The initial group of book sculptures was a group of ten elaborate sculptures that were left around various cultural locations in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, between March and November 2011, as gifts to the cultural institutions and people of the city.&lt;ref name=GdnDec11&gt;{{cite news|title=Edinburgh book sculptures turn the page |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/dec/01/edinburgh-book-sculptures|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Michael|last=MacLeod|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The identity of the artist is unknown, although notes with some of the sculptures referred to the artist as 'she'.  The sculptures were made from old books and were accompanied by gift labels which praised literacy and the love of words, and argued against library and other arts funding cuts.  An eleventh sculpture was presented to author [[Ian Rankin]], whose works featured prominently in many of the other sculptures. The ten Edinburgh sculptures were toured through Scotland in an exhibition in late 2012.&lt;ref name=GdnJuly12&gt;{{cite news|title=Edinburgh's mysterious book sculptures go on tour |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland-blog/2012/jul/31/scotland-poetry-book-sculptures|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Robyn|last=Marsack|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculptor was then commissioned to produce five more book sculptures to be hidden in secret locations around Scotland as part of Book Week Scotland, which commenced in November 2012. Despite the commission, the artist has maintained her anonymity.

The sculptor also made another gift sculpture in December 2012, which she anonymously presented to the [[Scottish Poetry Library]], already the previous recipient of two of her earlier works.

In May 2013 a new sculpture, featuring three eggs in a paper nest in a cardboard birdbox, was left in the Scottish Poetry library; this was followed by three baby birds in a nest, left at Leith Library. 
In 2014 a flutter or swarm of butterflies from an open book sculpture was left in aid of the [[Macmillan Cancer Support|Macmillan charity]]. This sculpture was bought privately but is intending to tour for a not-for-profit basis in 2015.

==2011 Edinburgh sculptures==
These are listed in the order of their discovery. In the first ten cases, the person who deposited the sculptures was not noticed, and some of the sculptures were found several days after they had been put in place.  The eleventh was a gift to author [[Ian Rankin]].

===First sculpture===
The first sculpture was found on Tuesday 2 March 2011 on a table in the [[Scottish Poetry Library]].&lt;ref name=GdnMar11&gt;{{cite news|title=Mystery 'poetree' is a symbol of library love Anonymous reader leaves a delicate gift to the Scottish Poetry Library |url=https://www.theguardian.com/edinburgh/2011/mar/03/edinburgh-scottish-poetry-library-tree-gift-mystery|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Michael|last=MacLeod|date=3 March 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised a tree with intricately fashioned branches and leaves, standing on a thick leather-bound old book.  At the base of the tree was a paper egg, broken in half and with the inside lined with gold, in which were a scatter of individual words, which could be put together to make "A Trace of Wings", a poem by [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]].&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{cite news|title=Mysterious paper sculptures |url=http://thisiscentralstation.com/featured/mysterious-paper-sculptures/|work=Central Stn|first=Chris|last=Scott|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was accompanied by a tag, addressed to @byleaveswelive, the name of the Library's Twitter account.  "By leaves we live" is a [[Patrick Geddes]] quote about the idea that you reap what you sow.

The note on the tag read: "It started with your name [https://twitter.com/byleaveswelive @byleaveswelive] and became a tree.… … We know that a library is so much more than a building full of books… a book is so much more than pages full of words.… This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas….. a gesture (poetic maybe?)".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The sculpture was nicknamed the "poetree" by the staff at the Library, and despite national publicity, the identity of its maker remained unknown.&lt;ref name=GdnMar11/&gt;

===Second sculpture===
The second sculpture was found in late June 2011&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; at the [[National Library of Scotland]], a "delicately crafted"&lt;ref name=GdnDec11/&gt; gramophone and a coffin fashioned from a copy of Edinburgh-based author [[Ian Rankin]]'s book ''[[Exit Music]]''.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For [https://twitter.com/natlibscot @natlibscot] – A gift in support of libraries, books, words, ideas….. (&amp; against their exit)".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Third sculpture===
Later on in June 2011 a third sculpture was anonymously deposited, this time at the box office of the [[Edinburgh Filmhouse]].&lt;ref name=GdnJune11&gt;{{cite news|title=Real-life Ian Rankin mystery of 'reverse heist' sculptures Series of intricate paper artworks linked to Rebus author's work left around Edinburgh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/30/real-life-ian-rankin-mystery-sculptures|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Alison|last=Flood|date=30 June 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This one comprised "a complex scene in a paper cinema; punters arrayed on seats watching men and horses coming alive from the screen and charging outwards."&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;  One of the audience had Ian Rankin's face, and was holding a bottle of [[Caledonian Brewery|Deuchars IPA]].&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For [https://twitter.com/filmhouse @filmhouse] – A gift in support of libraries, books, words, ideas….. and all things *magic*".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; A quote from [[Francis Ford Coppola]], "I think cinema, movies, and magic have always been closely associated" was pasted onto the sculpture.&lt;ref name=GdnJune11/&gt;

===Fourth sculpture===
The fourth sculpture was found on a windowsill at the [[Scottish Storytelling Centre]].  As it lay in a part of the building that does not have much footfall, it may have lain undiscovered at the location for a while, and so its place in the gift chain is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Scotland&gt;{{cite news|title=Edinburgh’s mysterious book sculptures to go on display|url=http://www.scotland.org/features/edinburghs-mysterious-book-sculptures-to-go-on-display|work=Scotland|date=August 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises a dragon hatching from an egg on a nest of feathers.  It is made from a copy of Ian Rankin's book, ''[[Knots and Crosses]]''.&lt;ref name=Scotland/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For [https://twitter.com/scotstorycentre @scotstorycentre] – A gift in support of libraries, books, works, ideas….. Once upon a time there was a book and in the book was a nest and in the nest was an egg and in the egg was a dragon and in the dragon was a story….."&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Fifth sculpture===
The fifth and sixth sculptures were both found on 24 August 2011, at the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]].  The fifth sculpture was left on one of the signing tables in the festival bookshop.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;&lt;ref name=GdnAug11&gt;{{cite news|title=Mystery sculptures appear at Edinburgh book festival |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/24/edinburgh-book-festival-sculptures?CMP=twt_gu|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Michael|last=MacLeod|date=24 August 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It comprised a tea tray bearing a cup of tea on a cake stand, a cupcake, a used teabag and a (real) old book. The teabag was filled with cut out letters, on the tag of which were the words "by leaves we live" (the Twitter name of the Scottish Poetry Library account referenced in the first sculpture). On the top of the tea in the teacup was a spiral swirl of words which read "Nothing beats a nice cup of tea (or coffee) and a really good BOOK", and on the tray next to the cupcake: "except maybe a cake as well".

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "To [https://twitter.com/edbookfest @edbookfest] 'A gift' This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas…… &amp; festivals xx".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Sixth sculpture===
The fifth and sixth sculptures were both found on 24 August 2011, at the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]]. The sixth sculpture was secreted about the [[City of Literature|Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature]] information stand in the entrance tent.&lt;ref name=GdnAug11/&gt;  It shows a man sitting under a tree.  It is made from an [[Everyman's Library]] edition of ''[[The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner]]'' by [[James Hogg]].&lt;ref name=GdnAug11/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "To [https://twitter.com/edincityoflit @edincityoflit] 'A gift' LOST (albeit in a good book) This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas…. “No infant has the power of deciding….. by what circumstances (they) shall be surrounded.. [[Robert Owen]]".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Seventh sculpture===
The seventh sculpture was found on 30 August 2011 on a bookshelf at [[Central Library, Edinburgh|Edinburgh Central Lending Library]].  It comprises a magnifying glass on a stand on top of a (real) old book.  Some words on the book are also shown in the lens of the magnifying glass: "When I go in I want it bright, I want to catch whatever is there in full sight".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For Central Library 'A Gift' [https://twitter.com/Edinburgh_CC @Edinburgh_CC] This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas…. Libraries are expansive".  The word 'expensive' has had the E crossed out and replaced with an A. The tag also notes, "Words on book – [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]]".

===Eighth sculpture===
The eighth sculpture was found on 23 November 2011&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite news|title=Final chapter in book sculpture mystery revealed|url=http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/news/article/723/final_chapter_in_book_sculpture_mystery_revealed|work=Edinburgh Council|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Scottish Poetry Library]], where the first sculpture was found in March 2011. The staff were first alerted to its presence by a note which the sculptor had left in the guest book: "Hopefully next time I’ll be able to linger longer – I’ve left a little something for you near Women’s Anthologies X. In support of Libraries, Books, Words and Ideas…."&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; The sculpture was found on a bookshelf. The sculpture comprised two parts: an elaborate cap made of a wing of finely cut paper feathers, and a pair of gloves with 'bumblebee' stripes.

The note accompanying the sculptures was written on both sides. It described the inspiration for the sculptures, a quote from the poem "Gifts"&lt;ref name=Scotland/&gt; by Scottish poet [[Norman MacCaig]]:  "To @ByLeavesWeLive....... The gifts 'Gloves of bee's fur, cap of the Wren's Wings.......' Norman McCaig .... maybe sometimes impossible things... In support of Libraries, Books, Words Ideas...." and "10/10".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

A longer note accompanying the piece made clear that this sculpture was the last in a series of ten sculptures:

"It's important that a story is not too long ……does not become tedious ……. 'You need to know when to end a story,' she thought. Often a good story ends where it begins. This would mean a return to the Poetry Library. The very place where she had left the first of the ten. Back to those who had loved that little tree, and so encouraged her to try again …….and again. Some had wondered who it was, leaving these small strange objects. Some even thought it was a ‘he’! ……. As if!  Others looked among Book Artists, rather good ones actually…….  But they would never find her there. For though she does make things, this was the first time she had dissected books and had used them simply because they seemed fitting…. Most however chose not to know….. which was the point really. The gift, the place to sit, to look, to wonder, to dream….. of the impossible maybe…….  
A tiny gesture in support of the special places…. So, here, she will end this story, in a special place … A Poetry Library …. where they are well used to 'anon.' But before exiting …a few mentions. There could be more, because we have all colluded to make this work……. Just a few though. 
* the twitter community who in some strange way gave rise to the idea in the first place
* [https://twitter.com/chrisdonia @chrisdonia] who gave the story a place, a shape and some great pictures
* and not least [https://twitter.com/beathhigh @Beathhigh] whose books and reputation have been shamelessly utilised in the making of a mystery …….
…… But hold on. Someone’s left behind a pair of gloves and a cap……….?
Cheers Edinburgh It’s been fun! X"&lt;ref name=GdnDec11/&gt;&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The revelation that this was the tenth sculpture caused some concern, as only eight were known of at this point.  It was feared that the other two might have been lost or stolen or even simply thrown away by someone who didn’t realise what they had found.

===Ninth sculpture===
The ninth sculpture was found on 24 November 2011 at the [[National Museum of Scotland]], where it had been placed on the plinth under a stag skeleton.  It comprised a [[tyrannosaurus rex]] bursting out of a copy of [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]''. Small human figures with weapons were amongst the shredded leaves of the book.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For [https://twitter.com/ntlmuseumsscot @NtlMuseumsScot] A Gift Your friends at @edbookfest suggested you might like this. …. In support of libraries, books, words, ideas and those places that house our treasures……". and "9/10".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Tenth sculpture===
This sculpture was the eighth in the gift chain, but was the last to be found, on 24 November 2011.  It was found at the [[Writers' Museum]] in Edinburgh, on top of the donations box in the [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] room.  It comprises a moonlit street scene, and is fashioned from a copy of Ian Rankin's second Rebus novel, ''[[Hide and Seek (Ian Rankin novel)|Hide and Seek]]''.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  It bore the words "commingled out of Good and evil", which is a quote from Stevenson's ''[[Jekyll and Hyde]]''.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "[https://twitter.com/curatoremg @CuratorEMG] A Gift 'The stories are in the stones' Ian Rankin In support of Libraries, Books, Words, Ideas …… and Writers." and "8/10".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Eleventh sculpture===
Although the artists had said that the series comprised ten sculptures, on 25 November 2011 an eleventh was delivered to the Edinburgh Bookshop, an independent booksellers, addressed to Ian Rankin.

The sculpture comprises two skeletons sitting on a coffin lid; the open coffin is cut out of a (real) old book.  The skeletons are drinking and smoking, and listening to a record on a portable record player. The record sleeve reads "The Impossible Dead/Ian Rankin/Some Secrets Never Die" and the coffin lid reads "R.I.P. 13/10/11".  13 October 2011 was the publishing date of Rankin's novel ''[[The Impossible Dead]]''.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For @Beathhigh A Gift "… something in us never dies" ([[Robert Burns|R. Burns]] 1790) In support of those who turn ideas into words, words into books …… &amp; of course books into libraries." and "11/10".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

@Beathhigh is Ian Rankin's Twitter account name.

==Reaction==
The sculptures, and the mystery over the identity of their creator, made local, then national and international news.&lt;ref name=SPLJuly12&gt;{{cite news|title=Gifted: The Edinburgh Book Sculptures on Tour 2012|url=http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/connect/blog/gifted-edinburgh-book-sculptures-tour-2012|work=Scottish Poetry Library|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of December 2012, the identity of the creator has still not been revealed.

The ten Edinburgh sculptures were brought together in December 2011 for a one night private exhibition at the [[Scottish Parliament]].&lt;ref name=GdnJuly12/&gt;

The Edinburgh sculptures were sent on a small 'mini tour' of Scotland between 17 August and 8 December 2012, appearing at Aberdeen Central Library, Dundee Central Library, [[Wigtown Book Festival]], Mitchell Library, Glasgow, [[Dunfermline Carnegie Library]] and the Scottish Poetry Library.&lt;ref name=Scotland/&gt; In the book ''giftED''&lt;ref name=Birlinn&gt;{{cite news|title=GiftED II? - The Literary Banksy Strikes Again|url=http://birlinnbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/gifted-ii-literary-banksy-strikes-again.html|work=Birlinn Books|date=16 August 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was published in time for the tour, the sculptor wrote that at the heart of the project was "a woman, who had been a girl, whose life would have been less rich had she been unable to wander freely into libraries, art galleries and museums. A woman who, now all grown, still wants access to these places and yes, wants them for her children...".&lt;ref name=GdnJuly12/&gt; The photographs in the book are by Chris Scott.

In July 2012 it was reported that a documentary about the sculptures, featuring Ian Rankin and [[Rory Bremner]], is being made.&lt;ref name=SPLJuly12/&gt;

After the tour concluded the original ten sculptures were sent back to their original locations with the bespoke plinths made for the exhibition with the intention that they continue to be accessible to the public.

==2012: Flowers==
In August 2012 the sculptor left fifty paper flower sculptures around the site of the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]], each with the [[Oscar Wilde]] quote "… freedom, books, flowers and the moon" and on the reverse "A Gift For You" and a limited edition number of /50.&lt;ref name=Birlinn/&gt;

==2012: Five Book Week Scotland sculptures==
In November 2012 it was announced that the sculptor had been approached via an anonymous email account and had agreed to make five more sculptures that were to be hidden around Scotland as part of Book Week Scotland, and that the finders would be given another small sculpture as a prize. Online clues to their whereabouts were released, one a day between 26 and 30 November 2012. Each sculpture was found on the day the clue was released; the person to reach it first each day received a paper sculpture trophy in the shape of a teacup, themed on the book and reading "A winning cop and a good book - the perfect combination" on the top.

===First sculpture===
The first was found on 26 November 2012 at [[Glasgow School of Art]]. It is a book sculpture inspired by [[Alasdair Gray]]'s classic novel ''[[Lanark: A Life in Four Books]]''.&lt;ref name=BBCDec12&gt;{{cite news|title=New chapter for mystery book sculptures|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-20466495|work=BBC|date=26 November 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finder's prize was a sculpture of a small teacup with elements of the ''Lanark'' theme.&lt;ref name=SBT&gt;{{cite news|title=Book Sculptures: The Full Set|url=http://www.scottishbooktrust.com/book-sculptures-the-full-set|work=Scottish Book Trust|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lanark'' sculpture is now displayed next to the Glasgow School of Art shop during opening hours.

===Second sculpture===
The second sculpture was found at the [[Robert Burns Birthplace Museum]] in [[Alloway]], and the sculpture was based on the Robert Burns poem "[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam O' Shanter]]" - which is set in Alloway. The finder's prize was a teacup featuring a horse's tail, a reference to the poem. The sculpture is on display at the Museum.&lt;ref name=SBT/&gt;

===Third sculpture===
The third sculpture was found at the ''Am Politician'' pub on the [[Eriskay|Isle of Eriskay]], where the nine pupils of the Eriskay Primary School found the sculpture based on the [[Compton Mackenzie]] novel ''[[Whisky Galore (novel)|Whisky Galore]]''. The finder's prize was a teacup with a bottle labelled 'whisky galore' on the top. The sculpture is on display at the pub.&lt;ref name=SBT/&gt;

===Fourth sculpture===
The fourth sculpture was found at [[J M Barrie]]'s birthplace in [[Kirriemuir]], and was based on ''[[Peter Pan]]''. The finder's prize was a teacup with a hook-tipped spout.&lt;ref name=SBT/&gt;

===Fifth sculpture===
The fifth sculpture was found at the [[Scottish Seabird Centre]], [[North Berwick]], and was based on [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]’s ''[[Treasure Island]]''. The finder's prize was a teacup with a palm tree on the top.&lt;ref name=SBT/&gt;

==2012: Another gift==
In November 2012 a third sculpture was given to the [[Scottish Poetry Library]], with the instructions that the box in which it was held was not to be opened until 7 December 2012 - the last day of the exhibition of the original ten. Built upon a copy of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s poetry collection [[A Child's Garden of Verses]] it featured a girl sitting under a tree, wearing a crown and reading a book, while the facing page shows Stevenson's poem, "To My Mother".

In the tree are the words, "You in a garden green" and "With me were king and"; on the girl's crown is the word "Queen". On the trunk of the tree are the words, "Were hunter, soldier, tar" and the inside of the small book reads, "And all the thousand things that children are". Some bunting dangling from the tree read "But time, which none can bind, While flowing fast away, leaves love behind." These are all lines from Stevenson's poem, "To Willie And Henrietta".

The note accompanying the sculpture read: " .... For the Love of Books.   Every ending marks a new beginning."&lt;ref name=SPLDec12&gt;{{cite news|title=Day Seven of the SPL advent calendar - The final book sculpture|url=http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/connect/blog/day-seven-spl-advent-calendar-final-book-sculpture|work=Scottish Poetry Library|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013: Preparing to fly==
In May 2013 a new sculpture was left in the Scottish Poetry library. This comprises three blue paper eggs in a paper nest in a cardboard birdhouse; the nest is on a platform with threads that allow it to be lifted out - the [https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisdonia/8958718010/ instructions] that came with it say, "Nest can sit at bottom, hang midway or be outside birdbox - it's yours now!" The box has images and text on either side with gold leaf in places.
The eggs are threaded together with slips of paper which read, "Preparing to start", "Sleeping in the woods" and "Life's little things"; the eggs have the words, "nest-egg", "new moon" and "great ovation" stuck to them. The tag reads simply, "Preparing to Fly 1/3  In support of libraries, words, book, ideas ........ x".

In June 2013 [[Leith Library]] received a sculpture of three baby birds in a nest, addressed both to the library itself ([https://twitter.com/leithlibrary @leithlibrary]) and to their Reader in Residence Emily Dodd ([https://twitter.com/auntyemily @auntyemily]), only the second time one of the sculptures has been addressed to a person.  Included with the book sculpture was a quote from A.A.Milne "It is more fun to talk with someone who doesn't use long, difficult words but rather short, easy words like 'what about lunch?'.  In support of libraries, books, words, ideas. Preparing to Fly 2/3".

==2014: Butterflies On The Move==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
As part of the Macmillan Art Exhibition called 'Inspired' held in Bonhams, Edinburgh, an intricate work of butterflies emerging from a book was delivered, anonymously. This book sculpture was auctioned to raise funds for this charity{{which?|date=October 2017}}. It was bought by the Mackenzie family{{clarify|date=October 2017}} of Edinburgh, who decided to tour this 'Butterflies' sculpture on a not-for-profit basis so that a wider audience could see it. The idea was that the generosity of the artist and the story should continue to inspire others, especially youngsters and those that had not yet been able to experience the 'book sculpture library tour' in Edinburgh. The Butterflies sculpture visited the following locations: The War Poets library, Edinburgh Napier University; BBC Scotland, Pacific Quay; Killin library, Killin; John Gray Library, East Lothian; Kirkwall library, Orkney; Glasgow Museum's Resource Centre, South Nitshill, Glasgow; Abbotsford House, Borders; Crighton  Library, Dumfries; Aberdeen Central Library, Aberdeen. The sculpture's tour finished in the Scottish Parliament and was commented upon by [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]]s and the First Minister. A 'time for reflection' parliamentary speech was given by Dr Colin Mackenzie, thanking the artist for her generosity and inspiration. 

During the tour the artist offered to collaborate with members of the public who sent in their own paper butterflies.

==Interview==
In January 2015 the artist gave an email interview to the BBC, in which she hinted that more sculptures were to come: "What makes you think 'Butterflies' is my most recent sculpture?".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30697553&lt;/ref&gt;

==The final curtain==

In March 2015 the artist announced that the time had come "to draw time on the project". The last sculpture would be a collaboration with the public. A request was made for the public to make their own butterflies before 31 July 2015. These butterflies would be made into a final sculpture.

== 2016: The Butterfly Tree and Lost Child==
The final paper sculpture was a collaboration with the general public in response to the Butterfly On The Move Tour. Butterflies flew in from all over the world and from all different age groups of contributors. The resulting sculpture was a 6'6' high tree with butterflies as 'leaves'. The tree was supported by a 'lost child'. The sculpture appeared at the Edinburgh Book Festival in August, 2016. A hand illustrated book was left with the sculpture. It tells the fictional story of the Butterfly Tree and how it reached out and comforted the Lost Child.
The artist intends to remain unknown.

"'''Snow Drifts'''" is the twenty-first episode of the [[Once Upon a Time (season 3)|third season]] of the American fantasy drama series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', and the show's 65th episode overall, which aired on May 11, 2014. The episode serves as the first of a two part episode for the third season finale and was written by [[David H. Goodman]] &amp; [[Robert Hull]] and directed by [[Ron Underwood]].
In this episode, everyone in Storybrooke joins Mary Margaret and David as they prepare to give their newborn son a coronation, while the time traveling portal that Zelena created before her demise comes to life, and takes [[Emma Swan]] and [[Captain Hook]] back to the Enchanted Forest before the events of the original curse. Emma and Hook must find a way to return to Storybrooke. But in their quest to return, they accidentally ruin Snow and Charming's first meeting, and they must repair the timeline with Rumplestiltskin's help before it is too late to undo the damage.

==Plot==

===Opening Sequence===
Zelena's time travel portal opens in the Enchanted Forest.

===Event chronology===
The Boston flashbacks happen years after "[[Awake (Once Upon a Time)| Awake]]" and before "[[Breaking Glass (Once Upon a Time)|Breaking Glass]]" while the Enchanted Forest past events happen after "[[A Tale of Two Sisters (Once Upon a Time)|A Tale of Two Sisters]]" and changing the events of "[[Snow Falls]]" and before "[[There's No Place Like Home (Once Upon a Time)|There's No Place Like Home]]".  

===In the Characters' Past===
In the past (our world) a young girl leaves with a couple in a car from an adoption agency, where an eleven-year-old [[Emma Swan]]&lt;ref&gt;According to "[[Selfless, Brave and True]]", Emma came to Storybrooke in October 2011 (the moment August started turning into wood, as stated in "[[The Stranger (Once Upon a Time)|The Stranger]]"). This was her 28th birthday, according to "[[Pilot (Once Upon a Time)|Pilot]]". Season Two and the first half of Season Three takes place a few months later, and the second half of Season Three takes place one year later, in 2013. In "[[The Tower (Once Upon a Time)|The Tower]]", David says that it's been nearly thirty years since Emma was born. This means that Emma has not turned 30 yet. The flashback takes place 18 years earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; is standing, looking upset that she'll never have a perfect family, but the foster manager comes up to her and tells Emma, "Don't worry, you'll find a home too, Emma."

===In Storybrooke===
In the present day, Emma looks happy and sees Mary Margaret holding her baby boy as she prepares for the upcoming coronation even though they haven't named him yet. Henry is looking for apartments and both Henry and Mary Margaret ask Emma what she thinks. Emma changes the subject and starts thinking why her parents are trying to expand the time they need to name the unnamed baby by using an age-old tradition. Meanwhile, Regina and Robin Hood are sharing some romantic time together. She tells him about how TinkerBell told her about them being soulmates, how she saw the lion tattoo but didn't approach him in the pub. However, Robin is happy to hear that, saying it must be the right time for them now. Later on at Granny's, everyone is recalling or retelling stories of how Mary Margaret and David originally met back in the Enchanted Forest and how they kept running into one another and were destined to be together. When Emma reveals her desire to return to New York City with Henry in an attempt to leave Storybrooke behind, Regina and the others exclaim in protest. Suddenly Gold notices an orange beam rising in the distance, which he tells them is the time portal. As this starts to happen, Emma tells everyone that she wants to go back to New York City and everyone including Regina doesn't like the idea. Emma then walks out and Hook follows her, taking the fairytale book with him. Meanwhile, Regina, David, Belle, Gold, Robin, and Mary Margaret visit the jail to see if Zelena had died around the same time as the portal's opening. They see on the jail's surveillance video that she committed suicide, but are unaware that Gold altered the video to make it look like she killed herself.

As they stop by the park, Emma tells Hook that she is confused about going back to New York City. Hook then hands Emma the book, telling her Henry hoped it would remind her where they're from. The conversation is cut short when they notice the time-travel orange beam forming and Emma runs towards the barn, where the doors burst open. The beam pulls Emma towards the vortex, and Hook tries to hold her back by digging his hook into the ground with Emma holding onto his leg. Emma can't hold on and is immediately sucked into the portal. Hook says "One of these days I'm going to have to stop chasing this woman,"  and jumps in after her. The portal closes as her cellphone, which is left behind in the barnyard, is ringing with a call from David, who was trying to warn her.

===In the Enchanted Forest's New Past===
Seconds later, both Emma and Hook land in the Enchanted Forest. It turns out that, while going through the portal, Emma was thinking of her parents' first meeting, which is how and where they ended up. The two then come across the wanted signs for Snow White from the past and then stumble onto a village, where they see Regina terrorizing the villagers demanding that they tell her where her stepdaughter is.  Regina proves that she is not kidding by having a woman arrested for helping Snow. Emma wants to help the woman, but Hook warns her about changing the future so they can't save the woman, since the villagers that were threatened by The Evil Queen included Pinocchio, Gepetto, and Granny. Around the same time, both Prince James (Charming) and Abigail are in the carriage in the moments before Snow and James are due to meet. Snow cuts a tree down to make her highway robbery, causing the carriage to stop as she is in a tree waiting. As Charming gets out the carriage to investigate, Emma makes the biggest mistake in altering the timeline by making an accidental noise and surprises Snow, who falls and runs aways, empty handed without taking the jewels from the carriage, and preventing her parents from meeting for the first time. Emma discovers that she screwed up the past and realizes that the only way to stop this altered timeline is by seeking out the only person capable of correcting this mistake, namely Rumplestiltskin. As the approach Rumplestiltskin's castle, Rumplestiltskin himself appears out of nowhere ready to kill Hook (as he still holds a grudge after Hook stole his wife, Milah, and [[The Crocodile (Once Upon a Time)|took the magic bean]] Rumplestiltskin was going to use to find his son, Baelfire) but Emma then reveals to him that he will create the curse that he hopes will one day find his son Baelfire, and killing Hook will further destroy the timeline. As the pages in the book start to become blank, time is starting to run out for Emma to fix what she has done, and Rumplestiltskin tells her the only way to correct this is to go to the ball that will be held at King Midas' palace.

Seeing that Snow wants passage after failing to secure one from Blackbeard, they hatch a plan to have her steal the ring for passage out of the forest by using Hook’s ship, which means they have to pay a visit to the tavern to distract a past version of Killian Jones, so Hook sends Emma to distract the Past Hook while he's drinking with his mates. The Future Hook suddenly becomes jealous of Past Hook for flirting with Emma, as she keeps Past Hook occupied while Future Hook offers Snow a deal, but things get out of hand when Smee first becomes confused by the difference in his captain, and second when Past Hook shows up while Future Hook is still there. Emma orders him to leave, and Hook looks on jealously as the Past Hook comes on and kisses her. The Future Hook then taps his previous life on the shoulder and punches him. Hook replies that he was asking for it, saying that he'll blame the rum for his actions.

Later that night at Midas' palace, Emma and Hook watch to see what happens when Rumplestiltskin appears. He gives them an invitation and alters their looks so they can blend in. As they enter the palace, Emma gives them the [[Pseudonym|aliases]] "[[Princess Leia]]" and "[[Prince Charles]]" in front of King Midas, and as they take a waltz together they see James and Abigail together but she doesn't want to dance with James. The Evil Queen arrives at the palace to ask Midas to search the place just in time for Snow to show up and take the ring. As expected, James captures Snow, altering the timeline of the first time they met (and she hits him, this time with a jewelry box instead of a rock). As she makes her escape, Emma sees her running and James yelling at her to stop and saying that he'll find her (another altered timeline in their encounter), only to have Emma (who finds the ring left behind by Snow and hides it from plain view) get caught by Regina and arrested. The story continues in the following episode.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3628">The term '''Sottorealism''' (''sotto'' Italian for “beneath” or “under” and the Latin ''realis'' “concerning the thing;” ''res'' “thing, object”) describes an approach in contemporary aesthetics. It has been developed with respect to painting, but also applies to photography

==History==
The American art historian [[Carol Strickland]] (born 1946) coined the term Sottorealism in an essay titled “Detour as a Route to Unity and Order” (2006). In the essay, she was concerned with the art work of the German-Greek painter [[Aris Kalaizis]]. While approaching his work, Strickland discovered a hermeneutical void between realism and surrealism, which she filled with the neologism.&lt;ref&gt;aus:[[Aris Kalaizis]] im Gespräch mit Carol Strickland_Katalog 'Rubbacord'_Kerber-Vg._S. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Instead of painting a surreal universe, the Sottorealist is interested in crawling beneath the surface of reality. While the world of the dream isn’t a creative act, and while no photographic device is able to fully mediate that which is beyond reality, the Sottorealist acknowledges that which is given in reality. In doing so, the Sottorealist, however, also acknowledges that unseen forces are active in our perception of reality, such as memory or cultural frameworks or metaphysical. By making these numinous realities present in his work, he creates a convergence of the seen and unseen.

The idea is to go beyond the appearance of things and to uncover substructures that are beyond the empirical reality. Sottorealists approach these second or third orders of reality by constructing elaborate models. These models could be viewed as experiments that are necessary in order to sound out the full scope of that which is part of reality, even though it is not an apparent and visible part of it.

==Process==
[[File:Werkgenese Blumenhaus.jpg|right|thumb|upright=4.0|500px|Model for the painting „Homegrown“  by Aris Kalaizis (2011). The actress [[Andrea Sawatzki]] at the set.]]

Building models of that which to be painted, is an essential part in the process. These models can be erected in public spaces or in an atelier. They offer an opportunity to probe that which the artist feels to have unearthed from beneath the surface of reality. These models can also range in complexity, be very elaborate or very simple. Photographic images taken while this model is set up, aid the artist during the final realization of the painting. 
Aris Kalaizis was the first painter who has made use of this concept, when preparing his paintings.

==Proponents==
Prominent Sottorealists are the Canadian photographer [[Jeff Wall]],&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Lauter: Jeff Wall. Figures &amp; Places_Ausgewählte Werke von 1978 bis 2000, München/London/New York 2002&lt;/ref&gt; the Finnish photographer [[Ilkka Halso]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Helsinki School'', Hatje Cantz, Ostfildern-Ruit 2007&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the American [[Gregory Crewdson]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Berg: Gregory Crewdson 1985–2005 Hatje Cantz, Ostfildern-Ruit 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The German photographer [[Thomas Demand]] is also thought to be a Sottorealist.&lt;ref&gt;''Nationalgalerie'', Steidl Mack, Göttingen 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In painting, this approach is unique and is an important feature in the work of Aris Kalaizis.&lt;ref&gt;''Making Sky'', Monografie mit Werkverzeichnis (1995–2009). Hirmer-Verlag, München 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Big Easel, Emerald.jpg|thumb|The Big Easel, Emerald]]

The '''Big Easel''' installation art piece, created by Canadian artist, Cameron Cross, is located in the town of [[Emerald, Queensland|Emerald]] in Central [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. Erected in 1999, and unveiled in October of the same year, the [[installation art|installation artwork]] depicts Dutch artist, [[Vincent van Gogh]]’s (1853-1890), famous [[Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)|''Sunflowers'']] (1889) still life painting, which is currently part of the [[Van Gogh Museum|Van Gogh Museum’s]] collection in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=Lisanne|last2=Besley|first2=Joanna|title=Monumental Queensland: Signposts on a Cultural Landscape|date=2004|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=Brisbane|isbn=0702234656|page=182-183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The monumental reproduction of van Gogh’s painting is located on the corner of Dundas Street and the Capricorn Highway, situated in the centre of Emerald’s Discovery Park. Weighing approximately 17,000 kilograms, Cross’ steel easel measures 25 metres in height, with the canvas measuring 7 x 10 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pepin|first1=Yves|title=Letter of Recommendation, Department of Foreign Affairs, Ottawa, Canada|url=http://cameronacross.com/images/reference/Easel%20from%20Forgeign%20Affairs.pdf|website=cameronacross.com|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The easel’s three legs consist of 30 x 30 square centimetres of steel tubing, which are secured to 10 metre piers by 24-1 metre anchor bolts. To recreate van Gogh’s canvas, Cross has used twenty-four sheets of plywood, laminated together from four panels, each of which is coated with fibreglass and then sealed with a gel coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=Lisanne|last2=Besley|first2=Joanna|title=Monumental Queensland: Signposts on a Cultural Landscape|date=2004|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=Brisbane|isbn=0702234656|page=182-183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plywood canvas is painted while flat on the ground, using high performance paint, which is both sprayed and hand-painted onto the surface of the plywood. 

The giant easel in Emerald is one part of a series of seven internationally located installations titled the ‘Van Gogh Project.’ This Project sees reproductions of the seven still life paintings van Gogh created while in [[Arles, France]], installed at different global locations. The first Big Easel was installed in [[Altona, Manitoba]], Canada in 1998 and another was placed in [[Goodland, Kansas]], USA in the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Melissa|title=Superlatives USA: The Largest, Smallest, Longest, Shortest, and Wackiest Sites in America|date=2005|publisher=Capital Books|location=Sterling, Virginia|isbn=1931868859|page=51-52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The artist is currently in discussions with other cities and towns around the world for the prospective locations of the other four outdoor installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pepin|first1=Yves|title=Letter of Recommendation, Department of Foreign Affairs, Ottawa, Canada|url=http://cameronacross.com/images/reference/Easel%20from%20Forgeign%20Affairs.pdf|website=cameronacross.com|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seven sites proposed by Cross are intended to represent a diverse societal cross section, including both rural and urban cities with a wide range of population demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enns|first1=Brian|title=Letter of Recommendation, Altona &amp; District Chamber of Commerce|url=http://cameronacross.com/images/reference/Easel%20from%20Altona.pdf|website=cameronacross.com|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emerald Easel has become a local landmark in Australia, attributed to the fact that it is the largest painting in the Southern Hemisphere. The installation also acts as a symbol of international fine art, in its role in helping to unite often disparate cultures. In its efforts to help celebrate the Emerald region’s reputation as one of Australia’s primary sunflower producers, the Big Easel reflects the town’s sense of community spirit and pride.

Cross’ Project has focussed on selecting seven global sites which have either a connection to sunflower agriculture or an affiliation with the artist [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pepin|first1=Yves|title=Letter of Recommendation, Department of Foreign Affairs, Ottawa, Canada|url=http://cameronacross.com/images/reference/Easel%20from%20Forgeign%20Affairs.pdf|website=cameronacross.com|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his time in Arles, between 1888 and 1889, van Gogh created seven different, but similarly themed, still life paintings depicting sunflowers in a vase. The artist originally intended to paint twelve panels of sunflowers to decorate the Yellow House at Arles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Gogh|first1=Vincent|title=Vincent van Gogh to Emile Bernard, 1888|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let665/letter.html|website=Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam: Vincent van Gogh, The Letters|publisher=Van Gogh Museum|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emerald’s Big Easel is a copy of the repetition van Gogh made of the fourth version of his ''Sunflowers'' (1888), which is currently part of the [[National Gallery of London|National Gallery of London’s]] collection. Van Gogh came to think of the sunflower as a type of artistic signature, stating in a letter to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]], in January 1889, "You know that Jeannin has the peony, [[Ernest Quost|Quost]] has the hollyhock, but I have the sunflower, in a way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Gogh|first1=Vincent|title=Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, 1889|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let741/letter.html|website=Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam: Vincent van Gogh, The Letters|publisher=Van Gogh Museum|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbolic significance of the sunflower to van Gogh as an artist is reflected in the Van Gogh Project. In Cross’ view, van Gogh associated the sunflower with life, symbolising the possibilities of hope and renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cross|first1=Cameron|title=Van Gogh Project|url=http://cameronacross.com/publicart/van-gogh-project|website=cameronacross.com|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the Big Easel emerges as a tribute to both van Gogh’s ''Sunflowers'' painting, as well as to Emerald’s local sunflower agriculture and its annual Central Highlands Easter Sunflower Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leighton|first1=John|title=A recommendation from the director of The Van Gogh Museum|url=http://cameronacross.com/images/reference/Easel%20from%20Sir%20John%20Leighton.pdf|website=cameronacross.com|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cross’ Van Gogh Project is designed to represent the nature of, and motivation for, the modern concept of reproduction and artistic appropriation in contemporary art practice. As an artist, Cross is interested in exploring the notion of traditional symbolism in art, and appropriating it into different social, historical and cultural contexts. In the case of his Van Gogh Project, Cross has taken the idea of the still life on an easel, a motif popularised in the nineteenth century, and enlarged it to an enormous scale, in order to transform this traditional symbol into a contemporary artwork in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cross|first1=Cameron|title=Van Gogh Project|url=http://cameronacross.com/publicart/van-gogh-project|website=cameronacross.com|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In reference to his creative objectives, Cross’ has stated via his website that, "By placing virtually the same sculpture in seven countries, with distinct cultures, I am curious as to how these sculptures will be interpreted. Will the sculpture be perceived for its reference to the sunflower, Van Gogh or art in general?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cross|first1=Cameron|title=Van Gogh Project|url=http://cameronacross.com/publicart/van-gogh-project|website=cameronacross.com|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Van Gogh Project is designed to promote regional, agricultural and tourism development in the sites selected by Cross. His Project has encouraged cross cultural exchanges between cities, with Emerald and Altona forming a sister city alliance through their mutual celebrations of Sunflower Festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=Lisanne|last2=Besley|first2=Joanna|title=Monumental Queensland: Signposts on a Cultural Landscape|date=2004|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=Brisbane|isbn=0702234656|page=182-183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter of recommendation for the Canadian artist, the mayor of Emerald Shire Council, Peter Maguire, stated that Cross’ Van Gogh Project is "one of the most exciting and inventive tourism project ideas focused on developing tourism and economic development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maguire|first1=Peter|title=Letter of Recommendation, Emerald Shire Council|url=http://cameronacross.com/images/reference/Easel%20from%20Australia.pdf|website=cameronacross.com|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maguire has also credited Cross’ Project with the recent growth in the region’s tourism industry, as well as the resultant job opportunities provided by the installation process. In his letter of recommendation, Maguire stated that "The giant easel is more than just a tourist attraction. The visitor is left with the impression that this booming city also has a cultural side. It has helped bond Emerald's arts and cultural groups together and in it they have something in their city to speak of with pride."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maguire|first1=Peter|title=Letter of Recommendation, Emerald Shire Council|url=http://cameronacross.com/images/reference/Easel%20from%20Australia.pdf|website=cameronacross.com|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation process has helped support the local Emerald community, recruiting volunteers experiencing temporary unemployment, as well as art students from the local schools. Cross also employed a local fibreglass contractor to assist in the painting and preparation of the plywood canvas, highlighting the Project’s ability to encourage a sense of community engagement and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=Lisanne|last2=Besley|first2=Joanna|title=Monumental Queensland: Signposts on a Cultural Landscape|date=2004|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=Brisbane|isbn=0702234656|page=182-183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Community contributions assisted in meeting the costs of construction, but a large portion of the funding for Cross’ Project came from the Emerald Shire Council and funds from the Centenary of Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=Lisanne|last2=Besley|first2=Joanna|title=Monumental Queensland: Signposts on a Cultural Landscape|date=2004|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=Brisbane|isbn=0702234656|page=182-183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Eye 2''''' is a 2004 Hong Kong horror film directed by the [[Pang brothers]]. It is the sequel to ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]'' (2002), though the two storylines are not related in any way except for clairvoyance of the protagonists and their ability to see ghosts.

==Plot==
Believing she is being rejected by her boyfriend Sam, Joey attempts suicide with sleeping pills, but recovers after having her stomach pumped. When she looks forward to a brand new life, she discovers that she is pregnant. Being tortured by the thought of an abortion and unable to contact Sam, Joey finds herself becoming delusional and emotionally unstable.

Joey begins to see the spirits of dead people, and also feels stalked by a mysterious ghost woman. She believes the ghost wants to hurt her unborn baby. As the story unfolds, it is discovered that the ghost is Sam's wife who committed suicide by jumping in front of an oncoming train. She is now awaiting Joey's baby's birth so that she may be reincarnated within her.

After discovering this, Joey would rather kill herself and her baby than let this woman become her child. While in a hospital, awaiting the birth of her child, Joey jumps off the building twice, but survives both times. She gives birth in the end realizing the terms with her situation.

Her psychiatrist's explanation is that Joey feels guilty about Sam's wife's suicide. Finally she accepts this responsibility, no longer recognizing Sam and disillusioned about her baby's father.

As Joey checks out of the hospital, the camera pans across a room of expecting mothers, each with a ghost hovering by their sides.

The film centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special Agent]] Sarah Ashburn and [[Boston Police Department|Boston]] Detective Shannon Mullins, who must take down a mobster in [[Boston]].

The film was released in the United States on June 28, 2013. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the chemistry, and performances of Bullock and McCarthy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/Critics-Consensus-White-House-Down-Is-Predictable-Action-Fluff/|title=Critics Consensus: White House Down Is Predictable Action Fluff|first=Tim|last=Ryan|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=June 28, 2013|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a success at the box office, grossing $229 million worldwide against a $43 million budget.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=January 2017}}
[[FBI agent]] Sarah Ashburn ([[Sandra Bullock]]) is an expert and effective investigator in [[New York City]], but is despised by allied agents for her egotistical and vicious personality. When her manager assigns her to a mission in [[Boston]], she meets detective Shannon Mullins ([[Melissa McCarthy]]), a skilled but loudmouth, bloodthirsty, sadistic, hot headed, [[dirty cop]] who is part of the [[Boston Police Department]]. Ashburn's ruthless philosophy clashes with Mullin's nefarious style of law work, proved during their attempt to interrogate local drug dealer Rojas ([[Spoken Reasons]]) who was captured by Mullins. Under pressure from her employer Hale ([[Demián Bichir]]), Ashburn reluctantly agrees to work with Mullins.

Ashburn and Mullins tail a local [[nightclub]] manager named Hank LeSoire (Adam Ray) to his business known as Club Ekko and place a [[Covert listening device|bug]] on his phone to get information on drug lord, Simon Larkin. As they leave the club, Ashburn and Mullins are confronted by [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents Craig ([[Dan Bakkedahl]]) and Adam ([[Taran Killam]]), who've been working the Larkin case for  months and are worried that their case will be compromised. Ashburn and Mullins discover a surveillance video in the DEA agents' van showing Mullins' brother, Jason ([[Michael Rapaport]]), apparently connected to Larkin's organization. Jason, recently released from prison, having been put there by Mullins to keep him off the streets and out of trouble.

Ashburn convinces Mullins to go to her parents' home to ask Jason for information on Larkin. On their arrival, it becomes apparent that Mullins' parents ([[Michael Tucci|Michael B. Tucci]] and [[Jane Curtin]]), particularly her mother and three brothers, Peter ([[Joey McIntyre]]), Mark ([[Bill Burr]]) and Michael ([[Nathan Corddry]]) two of whom have girlfriends, Gina ([[Jessica Chaffin]]) and Beth ([[Jamie Denbo]]) still resent Mullins for her involvement in Jason's incarceration. However, Jason does not have any ill feelings toward his sister, and tips her off about the body of a murdered drug dealer by the name of Sal Netalie in an abandoned car. Chemicals on the victim's shoes lead Ashburn and Mullins to an abandoned paint factory, where they witness a drug dealer being murdered by Julian Vincent ([[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]]), vicious criminal and second-in-command of Larkin's organization. They apprehend Julian but are unable to extract any substantial information regarding Larkin's whereabouts, even with Mullins going so far as to play [[Russian Roulette]] with Julian's testicles.

The pair spend the evening bonding in a bar, where a drunk Ashburn reveals that her [[foster child]] past may be partly to blame for her attitude. After a night of raucous drinking and partying, Ashburn wakes up the following morning to discover that, in her drunkenness, she has given her car keys to Wayne ([[Steve Bannos]]), one of the bar patrons. After unsuccessfully pleading for the keys, Ashburn and Mullins watch as the patron starts the car and is killed by a [[Car bomb|bomb]]. They discover that Julian has escaped from custody and means to harm Mullins' family, so Mullins moves her family into a motel. Jason leaves, intending to join the Larkin organization in an attempt to help Mullins solve the case. Jason gives her a tip about a drug shipment coming into [[Boston Harbor]]. Despite Mullins' reluctance, Ashburn gets the FBI to take down the shipment. The FBI finds that the ship is actually an innocent pleasure cruise ship. Jason was being tested by Larkin, who shoots Jason for informing the FBI about the supposed drug shipment. Jason escapes death but falls into a [[coma]]. A falling out occurs between Mullins and Ashburn, with Mullins vowing to bring her brother's attacker to justice. They then reconcile when they arrest several drug dealers as a way of gaining leads to Larkin's whereabouts, including Rojas.

Ashburn and Mullins go to equip themselves with assault weapons from Mullins' extensive personal arsenal, and infiltrate one of Larkin's warehouses. Despite taking out several of Larkin's men with a [[hand grenade]], the two officers are captured and bound. Julian is about to torture them with knives when he gets called away by Larkin. Before Julian leaves, he stabs Ashburn in the leg and leaves the knife in the wound. Mullins removes the knife from Ashburn's leg and uses it to cut the rope binding her hands. Before she can finish freeing herself and Ashburn, they are discovered by Craig and Adam. Craig begins to untie the two women, but is shot and killed by Adam. Ashburn and Mullins learn that Adam is actually Larkin, who has been working his own case from inside the DEA for several months. Julian returns and Larkin orders him to kill Ashburn and Mullins while he goes to the hospital to kill Jason. After Larkin leaves, Mullins manages to finish freeing herself and Ashburn incapacitates Julian with a head butt, after Mullins had stabbed him in the leg. Mullins and Ashburn race to the hospital to save Jason.

Upon their arrival, Mullins rushes to find Jason. Ashburn, hindered by the stab wound in her leg, lags behind, unable to move quickly. Mullins learns that, due to the foul language she and her family exhibit, the doctor moved Jason to another room in the hospital; she finds Jason's room, only to be disarmed by Larkin. He is about to kill Jason when Ashburn, having had to crawl to the room, subdues Larkin by shooting him in the genitals (much to Mullins' surprise, as she would never actually do so; scaring Julian earlier was only a way of making him talk). With Larkin captured, Ashburn requests to stay in the FBI's Boston field office, having developed a strong friendship with Mullins. Jason is shown having fully recovered from his coma. The film ends with Mullins receiving a commendation from the Boston Police Department. Members of her family are present and they cheer Mullins, now having reconciled with her. Ashburn later gets a call from Mullins to look in her year book. Mullins had signed the back of Ashburn's yearbook with the words, "Foster kid, now you have a sister", showing the strong friendship that Mullins felt for a previously unpopular Ashburn.

As a surprise, Mullins brings to Ashburn the cat that she had found in Ashburn's neighbor's house, believing it was hers. Earlier, when Mullins saw a photo of Ashburn with the neighbor's cat, Ashburn had lied and said it was her cat which had gone missing in New York. Mullins quickly deduces that it was not Ashburn's and the package is sent to [[freight transport]].

And it just felt like, I don't want to be the girl on the back of the scooter.

Despite the success of ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]'' (2011), studio executives were still uncertain of an action film with a female-led cast. "There were people suspicious of this attempt, who thought girls won't want to see a cop action movie and guys won't want to see two girls holding guns and we'd cancel out our potential audience," said producer [[Jenno Topping]]. "But we really believed, at the end of the day, it wouldn't be about gender as much as it would be about delivering a courageous action comedy with some heart to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohen|first=Yael|title=It's Kind of a Funny Story|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/its-kind-of-a-funny-story-the-heat|publisher=[[Marie Claire]]|accessdate=June 27, 2013|page=3|date=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And I wanted ''The Heat'' to feel like a party. I wanted the audience to have fun. And since I have to watch a movie hundreds of times as I'm making it, I wanted to use music that I wouldn't get tired of. Every song in this film is a desert island song for me.

'''''The Paper Chase''''' is an American [[drama (film and television)|drama]] television series based on a [[The Paper Chase (novel)|1970 novel]] by [[John Jay Osborn, Jr.]], as well as a [[The Paper Chase (film)|1973 film adaptation]]. It follows the lives of law student James T. Hart and his classmates at an unnamed law school, modeled on [[Harvard Law School]] but filmed on the [[University of Southern California]] campus (featuring its Bovard Administration Building, [[Doheny Library]] and Von KleinSmid Center) and in Stages 2 and 4 at [[20th Century Fox]] Studios in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077058/locations ''The Paper Chase'' (1978-1986): Filming Locations, Internet Movie Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot overview==

===Season 1===
James T. Hart is a law student from rural [[Minnesota]] who enters the intensely competitive environment of a prestigious law school specifically to study with Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, the world's leading authority on [[contract law]]. Kingsfield inspires both awe and fear in his students in his unremitting determination to prepare them for the practice of law.

To cope with the heavy workload, Hart joins a study group organized by Franklin Ford III. Ford is under immense pressure to succeed. His family has produced an unbroken string of outstanding lawyers going back generations, culminating in his demanding father, the senior partner in a very prestigious Wall Street law firm. The study group includes smooth woman-chaser Thomas Craig Anderson, slob Willis Bell, idealistic activist Elizabeth Logan, and struggling Jonathan Brooks, who is married to Asheley. Brooks drops out after he voluntarily confesses to cheating.

Hart works part-time at Ernie's Tavern to help pay his way through school. In the pilot, a waitress ([[Marilu Henner]]) shows him the ropes.

There was a four-year hiatus between the end of the first season and the start of the second.

===Season 2===
Hart survives the first year with flying colors and joins the staff of ''Law Review'' (an honor reserved for the top students), under the leadership of Gerald Golden. He becomes romantically involved with first-year law student Connie Lehman, only to lose her when she wins a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and goes to [[Oxford University]]. Later, he repeatedly clashes with ''Law Review'' rival Rita Harriman, though he admits to Ford that he is perversely attracted to her.

===Season 3===
Hart is now the president of ''Law Review''. The new students include Ford's younger brother Tom and former housewife Rose Samuels. The Ford brothers have to come to terms with their [[sibling rivalry]]. Rose deals with a surprise divorce and being so much older than her classmates.

===Season 4===
This season consists of only six episodes, including a two-part finale. In the two-hour finale, Hart has to decide between taking a federal court clerkship or a position in a private firm after graduation. His decision is further complicated when he is invited to apply for a newly vacant faculty position at the school, an option opposed by Kingsfield, who believes he lacks the necessary experience. Hart, the top student in the graduating class, gives the [[commencement speech]], bringing the series to a close.

==Production==
===Development===
The [[CBS]] [[television]] [[television network|network]] aired the series in the [[1978 in television|1978]]–1979 season. [[John Houseman]] reprised his [[Film|movie]] role, and [[James Stephens (actor)|James Stephens]] played Hart. It was cancelled after one year; [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] subsequently [[rerun|rebroadcast]] all of the episodes. In [[1983 in television|1983]], pay-[[cable television|cable]] network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] brought back the show with both Houseman and Stephens, as well as some other members of the original television cast. At the end of the fourth season, Hart finally graduates from law school.

===Theme music===
In the first year, the theme song was "The First Years", written by [[Norman Gimbel]] and [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]], and performed by [[Seals and Crofts]]. In the pilot, the opening used an instrumental version, and the ending used a different vocal version. Starting in the second year, a [[Classical music|classical]] instrumental piece replaced it.

===Opening narrative===
In the first year, the program opens with Professor Kingsfield, in class, saying, "The study of law is something new and unfamiliar to most of you—unlike any other schooling you have ever known before."  After the theme song, he continues: "You teach yourselves the law but I train your minds.  You come in here with a skull full of mush, and, if you survive, you leave thinking like a lawyer."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6840">The '''Wolf of Zhongshan''' ({{zh|c=中山狼傳|p=Zhōngshān Láng Zhuàn}}) is a popular [[China|Chinese]] [[fairy tale]] deals with the ingratitude of a creature after being saved.  The first print of the story is found in the [[Ming Dynasty]] ''Ocean Stories of Past and Present'' ({{zh|c=海說古今|p=Hǎishuō Gǔjīn}}) published in 1544.&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;{{cite book|title=Personal salvation and filial piety: two precious scroll narratives of Guanyin and her acolytes|author=Wilt L. Idema|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2008|ISBN=9780824832155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKimqfLnB1IC&amp;dq=Guan+Yin+Golden+youth+Jade+dragon&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The story is set during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]].  [[King Jian Zi]] (趙簡子 - BC?-BC 476) was leading a hunting party through [[Zhongshan]] when he happen to come across a [[wolf]].  King Jian takes aim with his bow and arrow but misses and hits a stone instead.  The wolf desperately flees through the forest with the hunting party in pursuit.  As the wolf makes its way through the forest he stumbles upon a traveling [[Mohist]] scholar Mr. Dongguo ({{zh|c=東郭先生|p=Dōngguō Xiānshēng}}).  The wolf appeals to the scholar's belief of "universal love" and implores for his help. Mr. Dongguo takes pity on the creature and hides it in one of his books bags strapped to his donkey.

When the hunters approach him, Mr. Dongguo denies any knowledge of the wolf's whereabouts.  After the hunters had left, Mr. Dongguo lets the wolf out of his bag, got on his donkey, and was about to take his leave only to be stopped by the wolf.  The wolf now asked the scholar to save his life again, this time from starvation.  Mr. Dongguo offered the wolf some pastries, but the wolf smile and said "I don't eat those, I dine solely on meat".  Puzzled, Mr. Dongguo inquires if the wolf intended to eat his donkey and the wolf replies "No, no, donkey meat is no good".  The donkey, upon hearing this, bolts from the scene as fast as its four legs to carry it leaving Mr. Dongguo behind with the wolf.  To Mr. Dongguo's surprise, the hungry wolf pounced on him and announced its intention to eat him.  When Mr. Dongguo protests at the wolf's ingratitude, the wolf presents the argument: since the scholar saved his life once why not do it again?  Now that it was starving, only by serving as the wolf's food will the scholar have fulfilled the act of saving his life.  Besides, the wolf complained that it nearly suffocated while it was crammed in the scholar's bag and the scholar now owed him.  Dongguo and the wolf debated and finally decided to present their case to the judgment of three elders.

The first elder they present their argument to is an old withering [[apricot]] tree.  The tree relates its own experience to the two on how when it was young, children used to pick its fruits from its branches and the tree would tell them to eat their fill.  Now it was about to be chopped down to provide firewood.  The tree sides with the wolf.  The wolf is very pleased.

The second elder they present their argument to was an elderly [[water buffalo]].  The buffalo tells its story of how it served its masters for many years dutifully providing him with milk and plowing his fields.  Now his master wants to butcher it so he can eat his meat.  The buffalo too sides with the wolf.  The wolf grins and feels even more justified in his request to eat the scholar.  Mr. Dongguo reminds the wolf that they have one more elder to seek out.

The last elder they present their argument to is an elderly farmer.  The farmer was skeptical and didn't believe that the wolf could fit into the bag.  To illustrate its point, the wolf crawled back into the bag and right away the old farmer tied up the bag and started to beat the wolf with his [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]].  The farmer bashes the wolf to an inch of his life then unties the bag and drags his dying wolf out of the bag.

Seeing the pitiful wolf the scholar thinks that the old farmer was too cruel but just then a weeping woman comes running towards them.  She pointed to the wolf and told Mr. Dongguo and the farmer how it dragged off her little boy.  Mr Dongguo now no longer pitied the wolf.  He picked up the hoe and strikes the final blow to the wolf's head.

==Author==
The authorship of this text is a matter of dispute.  The text originally appeared in the ''Hǎishuō Gǔjīn'' as an anonymous text with no author listed but it has generally been attributed to [[Ma Zhongxi]] ({{zh|c=馬中錫|p=Mǎ Zhōngxí}}) (1446–1512).  In classical Chinese literature, this tale is quite unusual in the fact that it is a fully developed animal [[fable]]. In most prose fables or poems where animals are imbued with human characteristics (e.g., ''[[Huli jing]]''), they are usually first transformed into human form before they are allowed to speak.

The term Mr. Dongguo (Dōngguō Xiānshēng) has now become a Chinese idiom for a naive person who gets into trouble through being softhearted to evil people.

==Variations==

Another variation of this tale can be found in the ''Precious Scroll of [[Sudhana|Shancai]] and [[Longnü]]''.

[[Leo Tolstoy]] in one of his "readers" for elementary school has a similar story, entitled ''The Wolf and the Farmer'' ({{lang-ru|Волк и мужик}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rvb.ru/tolstoy/01text/vol_10/01text/0212.htm Четвертая русская книга для чтения: ВОЛК И МУЖИК (Сказка)] (The Fourth Russian Reader, "The Wolf and the Farmer" (A tale)), in: Л.Н.Толстой, СОБРАНИЕ СОЧИНЕНИЙ В 22 ТОМАХ, Москва � 'Художественная литература', 1982, ТОМ ДЕСЯТЫЙ.

The '''Tyrone Guthrie Centre''' is a centre for creative artists at Annaghmakerrig, [[Newbliss]], [[County Monaghan]], [[Ireland]], founded in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradburn|first1=Richard|title=Writers’ retreats: the perfect place to make progress|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/writers-retreats-the-perfect-place-to-make-progress-1.2798519|accessdate=31 July 2017|publisher=Irish Times|date=20 September 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house was the family home of theatrical director [[Sir Tyrone Guthrie]], and he bequeathed it to the Irish nation to be used as a retreat. His will read that he would leave: 

: ''...my said dwelling-house, furniture, pictures and chattels and the income of my residuary estate to be used for the purpose of providing a retreat for artists and other like persons ... so as to enable them to do or facilitate them in doing creative work.''

The house has since hosted people such as [[Michael Harding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harding|first1=Michael|title=The artist as terrorist is a dying species|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/michael-harding-the-artist-as-terrorist-is-a-dying-species-1.2408638|website=Irish Times|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Loreena Mckennitt]], Oonagh Kearney, [[Derval Symes]], Page Allen, Rory Pierce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Composing in the wilderness - Rory Pierce's musical journey|url=https://www.rte.ie/culture/2016/1220/840192-composing-in-the-wilderness-rory-pierces-musical-journey/|accessdate=31 July 2017|publisher=RTE|date=19 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Roisin Meaney, [[Anne Rigney]], Gemma Browne, [[Colette Bryce]], [[Phil Coulter]], [[Brian Kennedy (singer)|Brian Kennedy]], [[Mary Dorcey]], [[Nuala Ní Chonchúir]] and [[Peter McCann]].

International authors have also completed residencies at the Centre, assisting them to complete or polish existing writing projects, going on to great success. These have included Australian authors [[Luke Davies]] and Linda Jaivin and British author [[Bella Pollen]].

The first Director was Bernard Loughlin [1981-1999], succeeded by Regina Doyle Acting DIrector (1999 - 2001) Sheila Pratschke [2001 2007], Pat Donlon [2007-2010] and now Robbie McDonald [since 2010].

The centre is a residential workplace open to professional practitioners in all art forms. Creative residencies (or artistic retreats ) are for maximum periods of three months in the Big House and six months in the Farmyard Cottages.

In a tranquil, beautiful setting amid the lakes and drumlins of County Monaghan, everything the eye can see is private in the gated {{convert|500|acre|km2|adj=on}} fully wooded estate. In the 'Big House' (as it is affectionately known) everything is provided for, including delicious food much of which comes from their own organic gardens. The dinner each evening at 7 is always a buzz of chat and discussion that is a welcome interruption to the strong creative work vibe that surrounds the centre. Each bedroom includes, writing desk and a chair and has its own charm and character with a selection of books, paintings and a view. Ten of the rooms have en-suite bathrooms and most have fireplaces. Linen and towels are provided.

Up to seven can stay in the 5 self-catering cottages all of which have a small easily lit stove to supplement the comfort and warmth. Eight well light warm studio spaces are also available along with a performance/dance space opened in 2006.
==Bursaries==
Among the many bursaries covering the cost of accommodation at the centre are:

'''''Verigar''''' was the first [[postage stamp]] series of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], issued in [[Slovenia]] after the dissolution of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]] at the end of [[World War I]]. The name of the stamp series is derived from the [[Slovene language|Slovene]] word ''veriga'', meaning 'chain', and depicts a [[slave]] who has broken the chains. The scene symbolizes the freedom of the [[Slavic peoples]] from Austria-Hungary. It was designed by the academic painter [[Ivan Vavpotič]], whose model was the gymnast [[Stane Derganc]].

==Description==
The stamp design includes the abbreviated name of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs written in [[Serbian Cyrillic]] and [[Gajevica|Gaj’s Latin]] script ("Држава СХС" - "Država SHS"). The stamp design also includes an image that represents a man who has broken the chains enslaving him; he stands in front of a rising sun.

==History==
The first stamps of the series were designed in the late 1918 in [[Ljubljana]] during the short-lived [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and issued on 3 January 1919 after the creation of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. They were then published in different versions until 1920. In 1925, Vavpotič regretted the choice of the motif, because he found it kitschy.&lt;ref name="Pošta534"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.posta.si/opis-postnega-ziga/725/90-let-Verigarjev?nodeid=534 |first=Bojan |last=Bračič |language=Slovenian |title=90 let Verigarjev |trans-title=90 Years of Chainmen |publisher=Pošta Slovenije [Post of Slovenia] |date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
On 19 March 1993, the [[Post of Slovenia|Slovenian post office]] issued a new stamp series using the ''Verigar'' man to commemorate its 75th anniversary. Another commemorative stamp was published on the 90th anniversary of the series in 2009.&lt;ref name="Pošta534" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5330">[[Image:Xochiquetzal.jpg|thumb|Xochiquetzal, from the [[Codex Rios]], 16th century.]]
In [[Aztec mythology]], '''Xochiquetzal''' ({{lang-nci-IPA|Xōchiquetzal|ʃoːtʃiˈketsaɬ}}), also called '''Ichpochtli''' {{lang-nci-IPA|Ichpōchtli|itʃˈpoːtʃtɬi||}}, meaning "maiden",&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;''Nahuatl Dictionary.'' (1997). Wired Humanities Project. University of Oregon. Retrieved September 1, 2012, from [http://whp.uoregon.edu/dictionaries/nahuatl/index.lasso link]&lt;/ref&gt; was a goddess associated with concepts of fertility, beauty, and female sexual power, serving as a protector of young mothers and a patroness of pregnancy, childbirth, and the crafts practised by women such as weaving and embroidery. In pre-Hispanic Maya culture, a similar figure is [[Goddess I]].

==Name==
The name ''Xōchiquetzal'' is a compound of ''[[wikt:xochitl|xōchitl]]'' (“flower”) and ''[[wikt:quetzalli|quetzalli]]'' (“precious feather; quetzal tail feather”). In Classical Nahuatl morphology, the first element in a compound modifies the second, and thus the goddess' name can literally be taken to mean “flower precious feather”, or ”flower quetzal feather”. Her alternative name, ''Ichpōchtli'', corresponds to a personalized usage of ''[[wikt:ichpochtli|ichpōchtli]]'' (“maiden, young woman”).

==Description==
[[Image:Ichpuchtli.jpg|thumb|left|Xochiquetzal in [[Codex Borgia]].]]

Unlike several other figures in the complex of Aztec female earth deities connected with agricultural and sexual fecundity, Xochiquetzal is always depicted as an alluring and youthful woman, richly attired and symbolically associated with vegetation and in particular flowers. By connotation, Xochiquetzal is also representative of human desire, pleasure, and excess, appearing also as patroness of artisans involved in the manufacture of luxury items.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen (1991, p.163); Miller &amp; Taube (1993, p.190); Smith (2003, p.203)&lt;/ref&gt;

She was followed by a retinue consisting of [[birds]] and [[butterfly|butterflies]].  Worshippers wore animal and flower masks at a festival, held in her honor every eight years. Her twin was [[Xochipilli]] and her husband was [[Tlaloc]], until [[Tezcatlipoca]] kidnapped her and she was forced to marry him.  At one point, she was also married to [[Centeotl]] and [[Xiuhtecuhtli]].  By [[Mixcoatl]], she was the mother of [[Quetzalcoatl]].

Ichpōchtli is an alternative form of Xochiquetzal representative of beauty, sex, crafts, fertility, dance, music, singing, weaving, magic, and love spells. [[Tagetes|Marigolds]] are sacred to her.

Anthropologist Hugo Nutini identifies her with the [[Virgin of Ocotlan]] in his article on patron saints in [[Tlaxcala]].&lt;ref&gt;Nutini (1976), ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt;
