A [[scrubbing tower]] for the synthesis of [[ammonia]]
gases blew up, releasing into the atmosphere several tons of [[potassium carbonate]] and bicarbonate solution containing [[arsenic trioxide]].

The '''2017 Lebanon–Saudi Arabia dispute''' began when [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[List of Prime Ministers of Lebanon|Prime Minister]] [[Saad Hariri]] abruptly announced his resignation while he was in [[Saudi Arabia]] on 4 November 2017. Shortly thereafter, the foreign relations between both countries and allied regional neighbors became increasingly strained. On 6 November, Saudi Arabia claimed Lebanon [[Declaration of war|declared war]] between the two states, despite leaders of Lebanon stating otherwise. On 9 November, Saudi Arabia, [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] asked their citizens to leave Lebanon. The conflict is thought to be part of the larger [[Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict]]. 

Lebanon's president and some Lebanese officials believe that Hariri's abrupt resignation was made under coercion by Saudis and have claimed that the Saudis have kept him hostage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/15/middleeast/lebanon-saudi-arabia-hariri-aoun/index.html|title=President: Lebanese PM held 'captive' in Saudi|last=CNN|first=Tamara Qiblawi and Hamdi Alkhshali,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]], [[Hezbollah]] and some analysts also believe that this was to create a pretext for war against Hezbollah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41946310|title=Saudis declare war on Lebanon – Hezbollah|date=2017-11-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November, Hariri resigned in [[Beirut]] but he immediately suspended it, then he rescinded the resignation completely on 5 December.

==Background==
In 1989, [[Saudi Arabia]] along with the [[United States]] helped to mediate the end of the fifteen-year [[Lebanese Civil War]] through the [[Taif Agreement]].&lt;ref name=intneg97&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Michael C.|title=Trying Again: Power-Sharing in Post-Civil War Lebanon|journal=International Negotiation|year=1997|volume=2|pages=103–122|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/pdf25_26/pdf/1997/MZZ/01Jan97/12609069.pdf?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=12609069&amp;S=R&amp;D=bth&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNXb4kSeprI4yOvqOLCmr0qeprVSrqa4TLeWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGutkywrLJRuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA|accessdate=10 November 2017|doi=10.1163/15718069720847889}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement left [[Hezbollah]] as Lebanon's only armed sectarian militia, due to its struggle against [[Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="ec"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21731173-saudi-arabia-effectively-hands-control-lebanon-iran-and-hizbullah-saudi|title=The Saudi hand in Saad Hariri's resignation as Lebanese prime minister|date=9 November 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Israel]]'s withdrawal from [[Lebanon]] in 2000, calls grew for the disarmament of Hezbollah; however, the party resisted any such move.&lt;ref name="ec" /&gt; Following the assassination of [[Rafic Hariri|Rafik Hariri]]—believed to have involved Hezbollah, after Hariri's call for Hezbollah's disarmament&lt;ref name="ec" /&gt;—Saudi Arabia called for the immediate withdrawal of the [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2005/Mar-04/3322-saudi-ruler-demands-rapid-syrian-withdrawal.ashx|title=Saudi ruler demands rapid Syrian withdrawal|date=4 March 2005|work=The Daily Star Newspaper |accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia has opposed Hezbollah's influence in Lebanon and its [[Hezbollah involvement in the Syrian Civil War|involvement in the Syrian Civil War]], as the group is seen to be strongly aligned with [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="ec" /&gt;

On 4 November 2017, in a televised statement from [[Saudi Arabia]], Lebanese prime minister [[Saad Hariri]] tendered his resignation from office, citing Iran's and Hezbollah's political over-extension in the [[Middle East]] region and fears of assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/04/middleeast/lebanese-prime-minister-saad-hariri-resigns/index.html|title=Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigns|last=CNN|first=Chandrika Narayan,|work=CNN|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/lebanon-prime-minister-saad-hariri-resignation-resigns-quits-future-movement-surprise-latest-a8037266.html|title=Lebanon's prime minister just resigned 'over plot to target his life'|date=4 November 2017|work=The Independent|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hariri's resignation led to a drop in Lebanese [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and warnings of a cut to its [[credit rating]].&lt;ref name="ec" /&gt; 

Iran vehemently rejected Saad Hariri's remarks and called his resignation part of a plot by the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia to heighten Middle Eastern tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2017/11/04/540985/Iran-Lebanon-US-Saudi-Arabia-Saad-Hariri-Bahram-Qassemi-resignation-prime-minister-Foreign-Ministry|title=PressTV-Hariri resignation, US-Saudi-Zionist plot: Iran|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lebanese Army responded with a statement that its investigations had not revealed “the presence of any plan for assassinations in the country.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2017/11/05/541104/Lebanese-army-says-it-has-not-uncovered-any-assassination-plans|title=PressTV-Lebanon army: No assassination plots uncovered|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November, Hariri declared in Beirut that he had suspended his resignation. He stated that President Aoun had asked him to "put it on hold ahead of further consultations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42079999|title=Saad Hariri: Lebanon PM 'suspends' resignation|work=BBC|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to talk about what happened in Saudi Arabia and claimed that events will remain undisclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/hariri-happened-saudi-stays-saudi-171128062831431.html|title=Hariri: What happened in Saudi stays in Saudi|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December he withdrew his resignation, in a speech in which he emphasized Lebanon's neutrality in all regional conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/05/lebanese-prime-minister-hariri-rescinds-resignation/|title=Lebanese prime minister Hariri rescinds his resignation|date=5 December 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kidnapping and hostage accusations ===
Upon Hariri's abrupt resignation from  Saudi Arabia, Lebanese President [[Michel Aoun]] is reported as having told foreign ambassadors that Hariri has been kidnapped by Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-politics-aoun/lebanon-president-calls-on-riyadh-to-clarify-reasons-stopping-hariri-return-idUSKBN1DB0ET|title=Lebanese president presses Saudi to say why Hariri has not returned|date=12 November 2017|work=Reuters|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pointing to his twelve-day stay in Saudi Arabia after his resignation, Aoun said that he considers Hariri to be detained by Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/lebanon-saad-hariri-saudi-arabia-detain-prime-minister-hezbollah-michael-aoun-president-a8055691.html|title=Lebanon just accused Saudi Arabia of holding their prime minister hostage|date=15 November 2017|work=The Independent|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to journalist [[Robert Fisk]], Hariri could not have resigned on his own, as he had already scheduled visits with [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] for the following Monday.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/lebanon-prime-minister-saad-hariri-resignation-not-all-seems-quits-resigns-surprise-saudi-arabia-a8045636.html|author=Robert Fisk|title=Saad Hariri's Resignation as Prime Minister of Lebanon is Not All it Seems|date=9 November 2017|work=The Independent|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Hariri had also arrived in Saudi Arabia on 4 November wearing casual dress, because he expected to go camping in the desert with [[Mohammad bin Salman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/24/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-saad-hariri-mohammed-bin-salman-lebanon.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fworld&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=world&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0|author=Anne Barnard and Maria Abi-Habib|title=Why Saad Hariri Had That Strange Sojourn in Saudi Arabia|date=24 December 2017|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fisk]] adds that when Hariri's airplane landed in [[Riyadh]]'s airport, he saw himself surrounded by police forces, who confiscated his cellphone and those of his bodyguards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to an American official cited by the [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]], Hariri was then kept in Saudi custody for eleven hours, put in a chair with Saudi officials repeatedly slapping him.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/a-saudi-princes-quest-to-remake-the-middle-east|title=A Saudi Prince’s Quest to Remake the Middle East|last=Filkins|first=Dexter|date=2018-04-02|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', a former American official stated that Hariri said that "Iran intended to continue asserting itself in the region", after meeting with [[Ali Akbar Velayati]], a high-ranking advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader. Hariri also posed smiling for a photo with Velayati. According to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' report, when Bin Salman heard about the events, "he was enraged", and "[h]e felt like he had to do something".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A senior American official in the Middle-East is quoted as saying that the plot was "the dumbest thing I've ever seen."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The entire fiasco was believed to be part of Saudi crown prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]]'s extreme measures to curb Iran's influence in the region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Several Iran-leaning and [[Shia Islam|Shia]]-aligned Lebanese groups, including Hezbollah, accused Saudi Arabia of holding Hariri [[hostage]]; Hariri's associates and Saudi officials have denied this. Several Lebanese commentators poked fun at the released pictures of Hariri in Saudi Arabia for their apparent similarity to those taken of hostages. The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah, [[Hassan Nasrallah]], declared "the resignation of Hariri illegal and invalid." In November, it was announced that Hariri was on his way from Saudi Arabia to the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Hariri's own party's media outlet reported that he would then move on to [[Bahrain]] and later back to [[Beirut]], but both of these trips were subsequently cancelled and he was sent back to Riyadh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/middleeast/lebanon-prime-minister.html|title=Where’s Saad Hariri?

== War declaration accusations ==
Parties on both sides of the conflict have asserted that the other side has effectively [[Declaration of war|declared war]]. On 4 November 2017, Saudi Arabia intercepted a ballistic missile fired from [[Yemen]], possibly targeting the Saudi capital of Riyadh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/middleeast/missile-saudi-arabia-riyadh.html|title=Saudis Intercept Missile Fired From Yemen That Came Close to Riyadh|last=Almosawa|first=Shuaib|date=4 November 2017|work=The New York Times|accessdate=10 November 2017|last2=Barnard|first2=Anne|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Foreign Minister [[Adel al-Jubeir]] said the missile was smuggled to Yemen's Iranian-backed [[Houthis]] through Hezbollah operatives.

Some analysts have speculated that Hariri's resignation could end Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system under the Taif Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-is-declaring-war-on-saudi-arabia-says-saudi-minister/4105881.html|title=Lebanon 'Declaring War' on Saudi Arabia, Saudi Minister Says|last=Ahmado|first=Nisan|work=VOA|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of Hariri's resignation aligned with the [[2017 Saudi Arabian purge]], leading some to speculate that it is part of Mohammad bin Salman's plan to consolidate power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/11/06/saudi-arabias-crown-prince-cracks-the-whip/|title=Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Cracks the Whip|website=Foreign Policy|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/saudi-arabia-s-young-crown-prince-moves-boldly-to-secure-his-grip-on-power-1.4388970|title=Saudi Arabia 'at a crossroads': What the arrests of several princes mean for the kingdom's future|work=CBC News|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/dce8e652-c3b3-11e7-b2bb-322b2cb39656|title=Saudi crown prince's purge extends into Lebanon|website=Financial Times|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also seen as a power play by Saudi Arabia to increase its influence in Lebanon and counterbalance Iranian gains in Iraq and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-politics-hariri-analysis/saudi-reopens-lebanon-front-in-struggle-with-iran-idUSKBN1D72BA|title=Saudi reopens Lebanon front in struggle with Iran|last1=Perry|first1=Tom|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=8 November 2017|agency=Reuters|last2=Bassam|first2=Laila}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/lebanon-caught-saudi-iran-regional-power-play-171107075704436.html|title=Is Lebanon caught in a Saudi-Iran regional power play?|last1=Alsaafin|first1=Linah|date=8 November 2017|accessdate=8 November 2017|agency=Al Jazeera|last2=Najjar|first2=Farah}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Fisk]] argued that Hariri's resignation was made under Saudi coercion with the aim of forcing Hezbollah out of the Lebanese parliament and instigating civil war in the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==International reactions==
On 9 November 2017, Saudi Arabia and subsequently the United Arab Emirates and [[Kuwait]] urged their citizens currently in Lebanon to leave the country immediately.

Israeli Intelligence Minister [[Yisrael Katz (politician, born 1955)|Yisrael Katz]] called the resignation a “turning point” for the Middle East, saying that “Now is the time to press and isolate Hezbollah, until it will be weakened and eventually disarmed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sentinelsource.com/news/national_world/despite-diplomatic-silence-israel-and-saudi-arabia-united-by-common/article_bd977175-8439-5b6f-89ad-7f0c70110df8.html|title=Despite diplomatic silence, Israel and Saudi Arabia united by common foe|first=Jonathan Ferziger Bloomberg|last=News|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 2017, French President Macron invited Saad Hariri and his family to France. Hariri left Saudi Arabia for France, before returning to Beirut to officially submit his resignation.

While a series of war [[tribunals]] and trials was organized, many of the high-ranking officials and doctors who devised and respectively performed the experiments were pardoned and never brought to justice. As many as 12,000 people, most of them Chinese, died in Unit 731 alone and many more died in other facilities, such as [[Unit 100]] and in field experiments throughout Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eamonnfingleton/2014/03/09/imperial-japans-abominable-dr-death-and-the-most-disgraceful-war-crime-cover-up-in-history/#4a568e3f45dc |title=Imperial Japan's Abominable Dr. Death, And The Most Disgraceful War Crime "Amnesia" In History |website=Forbes.com |date=2014-03-09 |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lit.osaka-cu.ac.jp/user/tsuchiya/gyoseki/presentation/IAB8.html |title=[IAB8&amp;#93; Imperial Japanese Medical Atrocities |website=Lit.osaka-cu.ac.jp |date= |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
Negative sentiments had existed historically between Japan and China, but those rarely materialized in armed conflict prior to the early 1930s. Japanese militarism under Emperor [[Hirohito]] had escalated from the [[Mukden incident]] in September 1931, when members of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Imperial Army]] planted a bomb on a Japanese-owned railway track in Manchuria. They used this "attack" as a justification for a full-scale [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] and the establishment of the [[Manchukuo]] state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/iwg/japanese-war-crimes/introductory-essays.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 20, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190336/http://www.archives.gov/iwg/japanese-war-crimes/introductory-essays.pdf |archivedate=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate predecessor events of the Manchurian invasion include the abovementioned [[Mukden Incident]] and the preceding [[Wanpaoshan Incident]] in July 1931, which constituted a dispute between Chinese and Korean farmers in [[Manchuria]]. The build-up to the invasion was minimal and involved no deaths on either side of the conflict. The US was mostly unaware of the events that occurred outside the main [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]], which gave the Japanese army, headed by the [[Kwantung Army]], political and military freedom to take advantage of a technologically and strategically inferior China. American propaganda depicted Japanese militants as sub-human animals, not unlike rodents or snakes. The perception of the Japanese soldier in the US during the war was that of a lowly, depraved and inherently repulsive being, whose depictions in propaganda pieces varied. They were often depicted as animals traditionally associated with depravity and as such intuitively instilled disgust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Miles |url=https://artifactsjournal.missouri.edu/2012/03/wwii-propaganda-the-influence-of-racism/ |title=WWII Propaganda: The Influence of Racism – Artifacts Journal - University of Missouri |website=Artifactsjournal.missouri.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cover-up==
The American government sent General [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] to oversee rebuilding post-war Japan and the shift to a democracy from a previously feudalist system of governance. MacArthur was also responsible for gathering data on biological warfare, which was obtained through human experimentation. The US government offered full political immunity to high-ranking officials who were instrumental in perpetuating crimes against humanity. Among those was [[Shiro Ishii]], the commander of [[Unit 731]]. Hirohito, as emperor, gave his consent regarding the policies and activities of Unit 731, [[Unit 100]] and other human experimentation facilities. He supported the militant agenda, but there is no evidence that he was thoroughly informed on most of the atrocities that occurred within the facilities. He, as was the case with many others, was also granted immunity. MacArthur, abiding by the [[Potsdam Declaration]], gathered a jury for the [[Tokyo trials]], where a number of Japanese officials were successfully tried and convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eamonnfingleton/2014/03/09/imperial-japans-abominable-dr-death-and-the-most-disgraceful-war-crime-cover-up-in-history/#5cb0f69045dc |title=Imperial Japan's Abominable Dr. Death, And The Most Disgraceful War Crime "Amnesia" In History |website=Forbes.com |date=2014-03-09 |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''bombing of SLNS ''Sooraya'' and SLNS ''Ranasuru''''' was an attack carried out on 19 April 1995 by [[LTTE]] [[Suicide attack|suicide frogmen]] of the [[Sea Tigers]], who attacked and sank two [[Sri Lanka Navy]] [[gun boat]]s moored in the harbor of [[Trincomalee]], [[Sri Lanka]] by planting explosives on them. The attack effectively ended the peace talks between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE, resulting in the start of the [[Eelam War III]], the third phase of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]].

==Background==
In the 1994 parliamentary elections the ruling [[United National Party]] was defeated and the [[People's Alliance (Sri Lanka)|People's Alliance]] government was formed under the newly elected President [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]]. A [[cease-fire]] was agreed to in 8 January 1995 and peace talks between the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE commenced. By April negotiations have failed and several incidents of violations had taken place. On 19 April 1995, LTTE leader [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] sent a letter to the government announcing that the cease fire was effectively over. President Kumaratunga immediately convened a meeting of her cabinet and armed forces island wide were placed on high alert.&lt;ref name="hrw2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/WR96/Asia-08.htm|title=SRI LANKA Human Rights Developments|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ap1"&gt;[https://www.apnews.com/f350abbde6b843dfaf9587f700716185 Explosions Hit Naval Ships as Truce Apparently Broken]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack== 
Hours after the armed forces were put on alert, a large explosion engulfed two [[Type 062 class gunboat|''Shanghai II'' class]] gun boats, [[SLNS Sooraya|SLNS ''Sooraya'']] and [[SLNS Ranasuru|SLNS ''Ranasuru'']] of the 3rd Fast Gun Boats Squadron which were moored to at the gun boat pier of in the [[SLN Dockyard]] at the Trincomalee harbor. Following the explosion both ships sank at its moorings. [[Frogmen]] of the LTTE Sea Tigers has penetrated the Trincomalee harbor and planted explosives on the two ships and detonated them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/36700885.pdf Adaptive COIN in Sri Lanka: What Contributed to the Demise of the LTTE?]&lt;/ref&gt; Navy divers recovered bodies of 11 sailors and four Sea Tigers which included two females. 22 naval personal were wounded with one later succumbing to wounds. Most of the casualties were reported from ''Ranasuru''&lt;ref name="ap1"/&gt; The objective of the attack was to disable the larger fleet units of the navy, there by limiting its ability to effectively patrol the coastal waters around areas controlled by the LTTE allowing the them to smuggle arms and ammunition from the intentional waters of the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationallawbureau.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Annex-H-Major-Attacks-Launched-by-LTTE-on-Sri-Lanka-Navy.pdf Major Attacks Launched by LTTE on Sri Lankan Navy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The attack effectively ended all hopes of peace between the government and the LTTE stating the third phase of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. Kumaratunga's government launched major offensives in the [[Jaffna peninsula]], which included [[Operation Riviresa]] that recaptured the Jaffna peninsula from the LTTE. The ships were later salvaged, but never repaired. The loss of two of its larger fleet units effected the navy's long range patrols and support of amphibious operations until replacement ships were purchased. The navy enhanced its harbor defenses and also acquired a sub chaser [[SLNS Parakramabahu]] in 1996 suspecting LTTE use of submersibles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.lk/epaper/sunday/2014/04/20/files/assets/basic-html/page27.html Remembering April 19, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bride of the Wind''''' is a 2001 [[Period piece|period drama]] directed by [[Academy Award for Directing#1980s|Academy Award]]-nominee [[Bruce Beresford]] and written by first-time screenwriter [[Marilyn Levy]]. Loosely based on the life of [[Alma Mahler]], ''Bride of the Wind'' recounts Alma's marriage to the composer [[Gustav Mahler]] and her romantic liasions. The title of the film alludes to a painting by [[Oskar Kokoschka]] named ''Die Windsbraut'', literally meaning ''[[The Bride of the Wind]]'', though often translated as ''The Tempest''. The artist dedicated this painting to Alma Mahler.

The film met a hostile reception from most critics and did poorly at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bride_of_the_wind/ Rotten Tomatoes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poster Art==
The film poster artwork depicts Alma reclining on a chaise longue attended by a lover, with a field of flowers in the background.  Alma's dress, her hair, the chaise, the field of flowers and even the air are replete with many of the stylistic elements of paintings by [[Gustav Klimt]].

{{for|the 1820 controversy around Queen Caroline of the UK|Trial of Queen Caroline}}
The '''''Caroline'' affair''' (also known as the '''''Caroline'' case''') was a diplomatic crisis beginning in 1837 involving the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], and the Canadian independence movement. It began in 1837 when [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] and other Canadian rebels commanding the ship ''Caroline'' fled to an island in the [[Niagara River]], with support from nearby American citizens. British forces then boarded the ship, killed an American crew member in the fighting, and then burned the ship and sent it over Niagara Falls.

This action outraged the United States. In retaliation, a group of American and Canadian raiders attacked a British ship and destroyed it. There were several other attacks in 1838 between the British and Americans. The diplomatic crisis was defused by the negotiations that led to the [[Webster–Ashburton Treaty|Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] in 1842, where both the Americans and British admitted to wrongdoing.

In the aftermath, the incident led to the legal principle of the [[Caroline test|''Caroline'' test]]. The principle states that the necessity for [self-defense] must be "instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation", as formulated by [[Daniel Webster]] in his response to British claims that they attacked the ''Caroline'' in self-defense. According to some authors, the ''Caroline'' test remains accepted as part of international law today. In 2008, [[Tom Nichols (academic)|Thomas Nichols]] wrote:

{{quote| Thus the destruction of an insignificant ship in what one scholar has called a "comic opera affair" in the early 19th century nonetheless led to the establishment of a principle of international life that would govern, at least in theory, the use of force for over 250 years.&lt;ref name=nichols&gt;Nichols, Thomas (2008). ''The Coming Age of Preventive War''. University of Pennsylvania Press. p. 2. {{ISBN|978-0-8122-4066-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Background==
{{further|The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)|Upper Canada Rebellion}}
{{Campaignbox Upper Canada Rebellion}}
The [[Reform Movement of Upper Canada]] (today's Ontario) was a movement to make the British colonial rule in Canada more democratic and less corrupt. [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] was one of the key leaders of this movement. He was repeatedly elected to serve in a hostile parliament that repeatedly ejected him for his reform efforts. By 1837, Mackenzie had given up on peaceful means for reform and began to prepare for an uprising.

In December 1837, Mackenzie began the Upper Canada Rebellion by fighting the British in the [[Battle of Montgomery's Tavern]]. Mackenzie's forces were seriously outnumbered and outgunned, and they were defeated in less than an hour. He also suffered another major defeat a few days later in London. After these defeats, Mackenzie fled to [[Navy Island]] in the Niagara River, which they declared the [[Republic of Canada]], on board the vessel SS ''Caroline''.

Throughout these events, the Canadian rebels enjoyed widespread support from the Americans, who provided them supplies and bases from which to launch raids on the British.

==Events==
[[File:1841 sketch of Caroline Affair by Mackenzie-employed artist.png|thumb|1841 sketch by MacKenzie showing the body of Durfee lying on the ground [foreground] while the Burning wreck of the "Caroline" drifts toward the falls {Background)]]
[[File:Amos Durfee Corpse.png|thumb|The body of Durfee, illustrated in 1885]]
On December 29, 1837, while the Canadian rebels were on Navy Island, Canadian loyalist Colonel [[Allan MacNab|Sir Allan MacNab]] and Captain Andrew Drew of the Royal Navy commanding a party of militia, acting on information and guidance from [[Alexander McLeod]] that the vessel belonged to Mackenzie, crossed the international boundary and seized the ''Caroline'', chased off the crew, towed her into the current, set her afire, and cast her adrift over [[Niagara Falls]], after killing one black American named Amos Durfee in the process. His body was later exhibited in front of a recruiting tavern in [[Buffalo, New York]].

Minister [[Henry Stephen Fox|H. S. Fox]], in an 1841 letter to [[John Forsyth (Georgia)|John Forsyth]], summarized the British justification for the incursion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The steamboat Caroline was a hostile vessel engaged in piratical war against her Majesty's people...it was under such circumstances, which it is to be hoped will never recur, that the vessel was attacked by a party of her Majesty's people, captured and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hartford Times]]'', "Mr Fox to Mr. Forsyth", January 9, 1841&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

New York's response: 

{{quote|Those of our fellow citizens...single-handed and alone, left our territory and united themselves with a foreign power, have violated no law...they have done no more than has been done again and again by the people of every nation. Your own recollections of history will furnish your minds with hundreds of examples. The Swiss nation have, for hundreds of years, fed all the armies of Europe; and who ever thought of holding them responsible for it? They did no more than Admiral [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]] did in taking part with South America. They did no more than [[Lord Byron]] did, who gave his life to aid the Greeks in breaking the chains of Turkish bondage. They did no more than [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]]. Gentlemen, I am not deviating from the case further than is necessary to remove the just odium which has been unjustly thrown upon those who joined the insurgents.|[[Willis Hall (New York)|Willis Hall]], [[Attorney General of New York]] on the ''Caroline'' Affair.}}

US newspapers falsely reported "the death of twenty-two of her crew" when in fact, only Durfee was killed. Public opinion across the United States was outraged against the British. President [[Martin Van Buren]] protested strongly to London, but was ignored.

On May 29, 1838, 13 raiders, mostly Canadian and American refugees from the 1837 rebellion, led by American [[Bill Johnston (pirate)|William "Pirate Bill" Johnston]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thousandislandslife.com/BackIssues/Archive/tabid/393/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/838/Searching-for-a-Pirates-Lost-Lair.aspx Searching for a Pirate's Lost Lair]. By Shaun J. McLaughlin. ''Thousand Islands Magazine'', February 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; retaliated by capturing, looting, and burning the British steamer ''Sir Robert Peel'' while she was in U.S. waters. President [[Martin Van Buren]] sent General [[Winfield Scott]] to prevent further incursions into Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~twigs2000/chapvii.html Chapter 7, "British Steamer is Burned by Patriots" in ''Northern New York In The Patriot War'', 1923, By L. N. Fuller]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were several other attacks, the biggest being the [[Battle of the Windmill]] in November 1838.

Later that year, Irish-Canadian rebel [[Benjamin Lett]] murdered a loyalist, Captain [[Edgeworth Ussher]], who had been involved in the ''Caroline'' affair.

The case was finally disposed of by U.S. Secretary of State [[Daniel Webster]] and [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton]], in the course of their negotiations leading to the [[Webster–Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842. Secretary Webster admitted that the employment of force might have been justified by the necessity of self-defence, but denied that such necessity existed, while Lord Ashburton, although he maintained that the circumstances afforded excuse for what was done, apologized for the invasion of United States territory.&lt;ref name="bassett moore"&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Digest of International Law.

== Aftermath ==
Shortly after the incident, a Canadian sheriff named [[Alexander McLeod]] claimed that he had helped attack the ''Caroline'' during the ''Caroline'' affair. McLeod was arrested in the United States in 1840 for his role in Durfee's death during the attack. This caused yet another international incident, as the British demanded his release, stating that he should not be held criminally responsible for following orders. The trial attempted to identify who exactly had shot Durfee, but this proved futile. McLeod was acquitted of all charges as witness statements made it clear that he had no involvement in the incident.

===Anticipatory self-defense===
This incident has been used to establish the principle of "anticipatory self-defense" in international politics, which holds that it may be justified only in cases in which the "necessity of that self-defense is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation". This formulation is part of the [[Caroline test|''Caroline'' test]]. The ''Caroline'' affair is also now invoked frequently in the course of the dispute around [[preemptive strike]] (or [[Preemptive war|preemption]] doctrine).&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, Christopher.

[[File:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|An 1849 depiction of Bridget O'Donnell and her two children during the famine.]]
The '''Chronology of the Great Famine''' ({{lang-ga|'''An Gorta Mór'''}}&lt;ref&gt;The term has appeared in the titles of numerous books on the event, as demonstrated by [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=%22Gorta+Mo%CC%81r%22&amp;=Search&amp;qt=results_page this search on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''An Drochshaol'', litt: ''The Bad Life'') documents a period  of Irish history between 1845 and 1852&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy (1995), xvi–ii.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the population of Ireland was reduced by 20 to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity, Gill &amp; Macmillan (1994), {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}, 357.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[proximate cause]] was [[famine]] resulting from a potato disease commonly known as [[late blight]].&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, ''Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives'', Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2006, p. 7. {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although blight ravaged potato crops throughout Europe during the 1840s, the impact and human cost in Ireland{{spaced ndash}}where a third of the population was entirely dependent on the potato for food{{spaced ndash}}was exacerbated by a host of political, social and economic factors which remain the subject of historical debate.

An important and controversial point of debate, that is notable amongst Irish people, was that Irish food supplies were sufficient until it was taken away by the British the feed the British, and the landlords kept economic benefits to themselves. Some commentators and writers controversially compared this explanation to "genocide".

== Chronology ==

===1845===

====August====
At the beginning of August, [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], the British Prime Minister, received news of a potato disease in the South of England. This was the first recorded evidence that the 'blight' which had ravaged the potato crop in North America in 1843-1844 had crossed the Atlantic. Cecil Woodham-Smith would write that a failure in England would be serious, but for Ireland, it would be a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 39&lt;/ref&gt;

====September====
Following earlier reports of incidences of the blight in England, on 13 September 1845 &lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}} pg.32 put the date at the 16th&lt;/ref&gt; potato blight was first reported in Ireland. The crops at Dublin were suddenly perishing, it was reported in the ''Gardeners' Chronicle'', asking "where will Ireland be in the event of a universal potato rot?"  The British Government were nevertheless optimistic through the next few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

====October====
[[File:Skibbereen by James Mahony, 1847.JPG|thumb|[[Skibbereen]] 1847 by [[Cork (city)|Cork]] artist [[James Mahony]] (1810–1879), commissioned by the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'']]
*As soon as digging of potato crops began, devastating reports started coming in. Sir Robert Peel found the accounts 'very alarming' and writing to Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary on 13 October reminded him that there was always a tendency in Irish news to exaggerate.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.41&lt;/ref&gt; Constabulary Reports from the 15 reported great failures, Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary wrote that the truth about the potato crop, until digging was completed, could not be fully ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.42&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] was prompted to act,&lt;ref&gt;''The Course of Irish History'' (1994) edited by T.W.Moody and F.X.Martin. Page 268. Mercier Press. {{ISBN|1-85635-108-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 15 October he decided to summon an emergency meeting of his Cabinet for 31 October. The remedy he decided was to repeal the [[Corn Laws]].&lt;ref name="cws-p50"&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.50&lt;/ref&gt; Peel then decided to set up a Scientific Commission to go to Ireland and investigate the potato blight and report on conditions.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.44&lt;/ref&gt;
*The emergency Cabinet meeting met on 31 October till 1 November. The first day consisted of reading reports and memoranda from Ireland on the potato failure. Peel proposed that a relief commission be established in Ireland, and a sum of money be advanced to the Lord -Lieutenant. Differences arose when Peel pointed out that these measures required an advance of public money. The purchase of food for destitute districts would open the question of [[Corn Laws]]. Was it possible, it was asked, to vote public money for the sustenance of a people on account of "actual or apprehended scarcity" and still maintain restrictions on the free import of grain; Peel declared it was not.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.51&lt;/ref&gt; On this issue then the Cabinet split, the overwhelming majority voting against Peel.&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2006, p. 7. {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}} pg.15&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to reach a decision, the Cabinet adjourned till 6 November.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"/&gt;

The principle of the Corn Laws had been to keep the price of home-grown grain up. Duties on imported grain assured English farmers a minimum and profitable price. The burden of a higher price for bread was carried by the labouring classes, in particular factory workers and operatives. It was claimed that if the Corn Laws were repealed all those connected with the land would be ruined and the established social organisation of the country destroyed.&lt;ref name="cws-p50"/&gt;

According to Cecil Woodham-Smith, the rising wrath of Tories and landlords ensured "all interest in Ireland was submerged."  She writes that the Tory Mayor of Liverpool refused to call a meeting for the relief of Irish distress. She continues that the [[Mansion House Committee]] in Dublin was accused of 'deluding the public with a false alarm', and the blight itself 'was represented as the invention of agitators on the other side of the water'. The entanglement of the Irish famine with the repeal of the Corn Laws, she says, was a key misfortune for Ireland. The potato failure was eclipsed by the domestic issue of Corn Law repeal. The Irish famine, she writes, "slipped into the background."&lt;ref name="cws-p50"/&gt;

====November====

*On 9–10 November&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 54&lt;/ref&gt; Peel ordered the secret purchase of £100,000 worth of [[Maize|Indian corn]] and meal from America for distribution in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg.38, 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.49&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 15 November the Scientific Commissioners reported that half the potato crop had been destroyed.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"/&gt;
*On 19 November the Mansion House Committee in Dublin claimed to have "ascertained beyond the shadow of doubt that considerably more than one-third of the entire potato crop...has been already destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.43&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 20 November the Relief Commission first met.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52, Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 57&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unable to persuade his Cabinet to repeal the Corn Laws, on 5 December Peel tendered his resignation &lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg.37&lt;/ref&gt; to Queen Victoria but was reinstated days later when [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] was unable to form a government.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===1846===
The first deaths from hunger took place in early 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Keneally (1999) ''The Great Shame''. London: Vintage: 110&lt;/ref&gt; In March Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland but was forced to resign as Prime Minister on 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 78–86&lt;/ref&gt; The new Whig administration under [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]], influenced by their [[laissez-faire]] belief that the market would provide the food needed&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 408–11&lt;/ref&gt; then halted government food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without any work, money or food.&lt;ref name="david2002"&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 224, 311&lt;/ref&gt; Grain continued to be exported from the country.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; Private initiatives such as The Central Relief Committee of the Society of Friends (Quakers) attempted to fill the gap caused by the end of government relief and eventually the government reinstated the relief works, although bureaucracy slowed the release of food supplies.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; The blight almost totally destroyed the 1846 crop and the Famine worsened considerably.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; By December a third of a million destitute people were employed in public works.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 311&lt;/ref&gt;

===1847===
[[File:Emigrants Leave Ireland by Henry Doyle 1868.jpg|thumb|''Emigrants Leave Ireland'', engraving by Henry Doyle (1827–1892), from Mary Frances Cusack's Illustrated History of Ireland, 1868]]
There were average crop yields in the 1847 harvest, but due to lack of seed potatoes to plant, the crop was low.&lt;ref&gt;Líam Kennedy, Paul S. Ell, E. M. Crawford &amp; L. A. Clarkson, Mapping The Great Irish Famine, Four Courts Press, 1999, {{ISBN|1-85182-353-0}} pg.69&lt;/ref&gt; Crowds began to throng the public works during the last months of 1846 and the start of 1847, which promoted exactly the social conditions for the spread of 'famine fever.'&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg.173&lt;/ref&gt; In late January and February, legislation called the Temporary Relief Act went through the British parliament; it became popularly known as the Soup Kitchen Act and occasionally as Burgoyne's Act.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg 136&lt;/ref&gt; This system of relief was designed to deliver cheap food directly and gratuitously to the destitute masses. This system of relief would be terminated in September.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg. 81–85&lt;/ref&gt; The government also announced an additional change in the system of relief. After August 1847, the permanent Poor Law was to be extended and was to become responsible for providing relief and as a result, all relief would be financed by the local Poor Law rates.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg 137&lt;/ref&gt; This put impossible loads on local poor rates, particularly in the rural west and south.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 174–187&lt;/ref&gt; With the mass emigration of the famine era, the horrors of the '[[coffin ships]]' and 1847 have ever since been associated in the popular mind, according to James S. Donnelly.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg.179&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1847 The [[Crime and Outrage Bill (Ireland) 1847]] was enacted due to growing Irish nationalist agitation that was causing the British government concern about a possible [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|violent rebellion]] against British rule in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, Cecil [[The Great Hunger]] Ireland1845 1849 Harper and Row   New york pages 326-327&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill gave the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] the power to organise the island into districts and bring police forces into them at the districts' expense. It limited who could own guns, and required all of the men in the district between the ages of 16 and 60 to assist in apprehending suspected murderers when landlords were killed, or else be guilty of a misdemeanour themselves.

===1848===
The blight returned in 1848 and outbreaks of cholera were reported.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; Evictions became common among the Irish who could not keep up with the demands of their British landlords. Famine victims on outdoor relief peaked in July at almost 840,000 people.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; On 29 July [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|an uprising against the government]] was led by [[William Smith O'Brien]]. After a skirmish at "[[Famine Warhouse 1848|Widow McCormack's house]]" in the village of [[Ballingarry, South Tipperary|Ballingarry]], [[County Tipperary]] the leaders of the rebellion fled to America or were sentenced to transportation.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kee (2000) ''The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism'': 270-89&lt;/ref&gt;

===1849===
The potato crop failed again in 1849 and famine was accompanied by cholera outbreaks.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; This deadly cholera epidemic killed one of Ireland's greatest poets: [[James Clarence Mangan]].&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt;

===1850===

By 1851 census figures showed that the population of Ireland had fallen to 6,575,000 – a drop of 1,600,000 in ten years.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; Cormac Ó Gráda and Joel Mokyr have described the 1851 census as a famous but flawed source. They contend that the combination of institutional and individuals figures gives "an incomplete and biased count" of fatalities during the famine.&lt;ref name="cormac2006"&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland’s Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, University College Dublin Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}} pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The famine left in its wake up to a million dead and another million emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 226&lt;/ref&gt; The famine caused a sense of lasting bitterness by the Irish towards the British government, whom many blamed — then and now — for the starvation of so many people.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 412–13&lt;/ref&gt; The fall-out of the famine continued for decades afterwards.

'''Computer tan hoax''' refers to a trick website set up by [[skin cancer]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] '''''Skcin''''' in 2009 to spread awareness about skin cancer through the [[Internet]]. The fake company was promoted by leaflets, [[street marketing]] and online ads, which directed users to the website where they were directed to download software.

== History ==

Launched on 3 February 2009, and originally planned to run for seven days, the site received more than 30,000 hits in the first 24 hours and over 1 million hits in the first two months.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/nottinghamshire/7969758.stm|title='Computer tan' website scores hit |date=28 March 2009|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="br"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/879035/Computer-tan-hoax-fools-30000-seeing-dangers-skin-cancer/|title=Computer tan hoax fools 30,000 into seeing dangers of skin cancer|publisher=[[Brand Republic]]|date=2009-02-05|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise of the hoax is that software downloaded from the website recalibrates the user's computer monitor or [[mobile phone]] to produce [[ultraviolet rays]], after promising to give the user a skin analysis. Described as a "revolutionary new online tanning service"&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/mar/29/computer-tanning-skcin-cancer|title= Computer tanning hoax comes to light|date=29 March 2009 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=2009-03-30 | location=London | first=Rowan | last=Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; that promises an all-year tan, upon activating the "five-minute free tan trial", bars from a [[sunbed]] flash on the screen followed by the message "Don't be fooled, UV exposure can kill",&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; and then by images depicting the victims of sun damage.

The advertisement was shown on 75 screens in 11 stations on the [[London Underground]], where it was projected to be seen by up to 1.7 million commuters. It was also seeded online, where several bloggers joined in on the hoax. In response to the number of hits received by the website, a spokesperson for the charity described it as:
{{Rquote|left|... an astonishing response [which] has undoubtedly helped raise awareness of the dangers of skin cancer.|Charity spokesperson|[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/mar/29/computer-tanning-skcin-cancer ''The Guardian'', 29 March 2009]}}{{clear}}

Skcin was set up in memory of Karen Clifford, a  resident of [[Nottingham]], [[England]], who died of skin cancer in 2005.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

'''Dhaka International Trade Fair''' (DITF) (Bangla: ঢাকা আন্তর্জাতিক বাণিজ্য মেলা) is an international trade fair in [[Bangladesh]]. It is organized by the [[Export_Promotion_Bureau,_Bangladesh|Export Promotion Bureau]] together with the [http://www.mincom.gov.bd  Ministry of Commerce] of the Government of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=About DITF|url=http://www.ditf-epb.gov.bd/about_ditf|website=ditf-epb.gov.bd|publisher=Dhaka International Trade Fair|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DITF is held from the first week of January to the first week of February every year. The entrance fee is less than US $1 and it is open from 10 am to 10 pm everyday. Ever since the first fair was inaugurated on 1 December 1995, DITF has been held annually at [[Sher-e-Bangla Nagor Thana|Sher-E-Bangla Nagar]] in Dhaka on the west side of [[Bangabandhu International Conference Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wahid|first1=Shahnoor|title=Month-long extravaganza|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/month-long-extravaganza-6599|website=thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Bangladeshi companies, many companies from around the world participate routinely every year. There are country specific foreign sections at the fair, which has over seven hundred mini-stalls, general stalls, premium stalls, mini-pavilions and mega-pavilions. The finest local and foreign products are showcased at the fair. Every year hundreds of thousands of people visit the fair to enjoy a wonderful day shopping for the best products from Bangladesh and overseas. Products displayed and sold include electronics, cars, porcelain wares, machinery, carpets, toys, ceramics, fabrics, melamine wares, sanitary products, handicrafts, ready-made garments, home appliances, processed foods, furniture, textiles, plastic goods, jute products, winter clothes, leather goods, cosmetics, sports goods, jewellery and more. Visitors are drawn to the numerous attractive discounts, special offers, introductory prices, gifts and lotteries of DITF. Various food stalls offer delectable local and foreign food items to customers wishing to take a break from exploring the huge fair venue.

A shopping spree begins from day one and gathers momentum from the middle of January. The last seven days see hectic buying with very large crowds during holidays and especially during the weekends, which are Fridays and Saturdays in Bangladesh. Shopping enthusiasts make a mental note of the direction they wish to go and where amenities such as washrooms, [[Automatic Teller Machine|ATM booths]] and food stalls are located in order to successfully explore the fair in its entirety. One cannot expect to cover the entire fair in a single visit. Since the fair ground is enormous, a pair of comfortable walking shoes is very important and has to be worn. Firemen, police and hundreds of close-circuit cameras provide comprehensive security. There are many ATM booths of various banks, which accept all major debit and credit cards, where people withdraw money in local currency if extra cash is required. Other special facilities include medical centers; mother and child daycare centers; children’s park; eco-park; e-Shop; healthcare center; a mosque; over fifty toilets; and three car parks accommodating over a thousand cars.

The fair provides a good opportunity to take friends and family out, enjoy music, have delicious food and indulge in an amazing shopping escapade. Dhaka International Trade Fair is an excellent opportunity for businesses to build local as well as foreign networks and establish contacts in Bangladesh all the while selling their most outstanding products.

Throughout the Doctor Who Fan base fraternity, Doctor Who: A Celebration is one of the most sought after recordings. Due to the main transmission being via the BBC Red Button Service, many fans did not know the show was being broadcast or did not have access to the Red Button Service.  Despite numerous requests to the BBC, the BBC have no plan to show a repeat of this show, nor do they plan to release it on DVD.

==Kauai==
[[Kauai]] Festival of Lights was founded in 1996 by artist Elizabeth Freeman to share the joy of the Christmas season through decorations created using recycled materials.

As the Festival of Lights’ Creator and Art Director, Freeman has produced the event to showcase "Kauai-style" decorations crafted by volunteers, as well as the late Auntie Josie Chansky's unique "folk art" creations. Freeman’s most recognized themed trees include Spam, Hula Bear, Kilauea Lighthouse, Peacock and the nationally recognized Aloha Recycled Treasures made from plastic water bottles. Other recent additions include the "If Can, Can" tree with recycled aluminum can ornaments and a dazzling "CD" tree with recycled CDs from S.C.R.A.P. (Scrounger's Center for Reusable Art Parts) in San Francisco, and the "Lure of the Sea" tree, decorated with ornaments of embossed recycled aluminum cans and recycled containers. New in 2015 was the Over the Rainbow Tree, decorated with colorful flowers and butterflies created from recycled aluminum cans and water bottles.

===History and background===
For nearly 40 years, first on Oahu and then 18 years on Kauai, Auntie Josie opened her home to anyone who wanted to see the Christmas decorations she created using recycled materials that were displayed inside and outside of her home. Auntie Josie’s home became known as “The Christmas House” and generations of families began making it part of their holiday traditions.

Auntie Josie’s husband died in 1996. Out of grief and the sad realization that she did not have the strength to put up all the decorations herself, Auntie Josie held a garage sale. Luckily, the loss of the “Christmas House” to the community was recognized and her entire collection was saved with a multi-thousand dollar purchase by Freeman and donated to the county of Kauai. Freeman organized the first Festival of Lights in 1996, providing a public venue to display the decorations, and continues to run the event with funding by the County of Kauai, Hawaii Tourism Authority, Friends of the Festival of Lights and private businesses and individuals.

In 2006, Auntie Josie was honored by both the Senate and the Office of the Mayor for her 50 years of contribution to Hawaii’s holiday season. The Hawaii House of Representatives had also recognized her work in 1975. In 2006, Auntie Josie was honored with Proclamations by both Senator Hooser of the Hawaii State Legislature and Former Kauai Mayor Baptiste for her 50 years of contribution to Hawaii’s holiday season. A week before Auntie Josie’s passing on February 3, 2009, Kauai Mayor Carvalho also issued a proclamation to Auntie Josie.

Today, Festival of Lights represents about 35 percent of Auntie Josie’s decorations with the remaining pieces designed by Freeman. Freeman presents a collection of Christmas art inspired by her and created with the assistance of local artisans from recycled materials.

More than 5,000 people attend Opening Night at the Historic County Building on the first Friday of December at this free event. Visitors enjoy caroling by the Kauai Chorale and Santa leading a Lighting Countdown of the Historic Park.  The doors then officially open for viewing of the interior of the Historic County Building and its illuminated Christmas decorations. Visitors can continue to view the Festival of Lights through Christmas Eve.

===Elizabeth Freeman===
Elizabeth Freeman is an artist and designer with a background in interior design, graphic design and magazine design. Her work has been displayed at the Smithsonian and the Museum of Arts and Design in New York. A resident of Kauai for almost 30 years, Freeman conducts regular tutorials with local high schools and civic organizations about the beauty of art and creating trash-to-treasure art pieces from recycled materials.

{{Kidnapping}} 
{{Criminal law}}
In [[international human rights law]], a '''forced disappearance''' (or '''enforced disappearance''') occurs when a person is secretly abducted or imprisoned by a [[State (polity)|state]] or [[political organization]] or by a third party with the authorization, support, or acquiescence of a state or political organization, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the person's fate and whereabouts, with the intent of placing the victim outside the protection of the law.&lt;ref name="HenckaertsDoswald-Beck2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean-Marie Henckaerts|author2=Louise Doswald-Beck|author3=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] |title=Customary International Humanitarian Law: Rules|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ny1Dv3VNPYC&amp;pg=PA342|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80899-6|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], which came into force on 1 July 2002, when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed at any civilian population, a "forced disappearance" qualifies as a [[crime against humanity]] and, thus, is not subject to a [[statute of limitations]]. On 20 December 2006, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]].

Often, forced disappearance implies murder. The victim in such a case is [[kidnapping|abducted]], illegally [[prison|detained]] and often tortured during interrogation, and killed, with the body hidden. Typically, a murder will be surreptitious, with the corpse disposed of to escape discovery so that the person apparently vanishes. The party committing the murder has [[plausible deniability]], as nobody can provide evidence of the victim's death.

"Disappearing" political rivals is also a way for regimes to engender feelings of [[complicity]] in populations. The difficulty of publicly fighting a government that murders in secret can result in widespread pretense that everything is normal, as it did in the [[Dirty War]] in Argentina.

==Human rights law==
In [[international human rights law]], disappearances at the hands of the state have been codified as "enforced" or "forced disappearances" since the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]]. For example, the [[Rome Statute]] establishing the [[International Criminal Court]] defines enforced disappearance as a [[crime against humanity]], and the practice is specifically addressed by the [[Organization of American States|OAS]]'s Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons. There is also some authority indicating that enforced disappearances occurring during armed conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Brian |last=Finucane |ssrn=1427062 |title=Enforced Disappearance as a Crime Under International Law |journal=Yale Journal of International Law |volume=35 |page=171 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Third Reich's Night and Fog program, may constitute war crimes.

In February 1980 the United Nations established the [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Disappearances/Pages/DisappearancesIndex.aspx Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances], "the first United Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a universal mandate". Its main task "is to assist families in determining the fate or whereabouts of their family members who are reportedly disappeared". In August 2014, the Working Group reported 43,250 unresolved cases of disappearances in 88 different States.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, August 2014; online at http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Disappearances/Pages/Annual.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]], adopted by the UN General Assembly on 20 December 2006, also states that the widespread or systematic practice of enforced disappearances constitutes a crime against humanity. It gives victims' families the right to seek reparations, and to demand the truth about the disappearance of their loved ones. The Convention provides for the right not to be subjected to enforced disappearance, as well as the right for the relatives of the disappeared person to know the truth. The Convention contains several provisions concerning prevention, investigation and sanctioning of this crime, as well as the rights of victims and their relatives, and the wrongful removal of children born during their captivity. The Convention further sets forth the obligation of international co-operation, both in the suppression of the practice, and in dealing with humanitarian aspects related to the crime. The Convention establishes a Committee on Enforced Disappearances, which will be charged with important and innovative functions of monitoring and protection at international level. Currently, an international campaign of the [[International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances]] is working towards universal ratification of the Convention.

Disappearances work on two levels: not only do they silence opponents and critics who have disappeared, but they also create uncertainty and fear in the wider community, silencing others who would oppose and criticise. Disappearances entail the violation of many [[fundamental right|fundamental]] human rights. For the disappeared person, these include the [[Freedom (political)|right to liberty]], the right to personal security and humane treatment (including freedom from torture), the [[right to a fair trial]], to [[counsel|legal counsel]] and to [[equal protection]] under the law, and the [[presumption of innocence|right of presumption of innocence]] among others. Their families, who often spend the rest of their lives searching for information on the disappeared, are also victims.

== History of the legal development and international jurisprudence ==

=== General background ===
The evocation of the crime of forced disappearance begins with the history of the rights in the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]] and the Citizen, formulated on August 26, 1789 in France by the authorities that came out of the [[French Revolution]], where it was already stated in Articles 7 and 12:

&lt;blockquote&gt;art. 7. No person may be charged, detained or imprisoned except in cases determined by law and in the manner prescribed therein. Those requesting, facilitating, executing or executing arbitrary orders must be punished ... (''Nul homme ne peut être accusé, arrêté or détenu que dans les cas déterminés par la loi et selon les formes qu'elle a prescrites Ceux qui sollicitent, Expédient, exécutent or font exécuter des ordres arbitraires doivent être punis; more tout citoyen appelé ou saisi in vertu de la loi doit obéir à l'instant; il rendé coupable par la résistance.'')

...

art. 12. The guarantee of the rights of man and of the citizen needs a public force. This force is therefore instituted for the benefit of all, and not for the particular utility of those who are in charge of it. (''La garantie des droits de l'homme et du citoyen nécessite une force publique; cette force est donc instituée pour l'avantage de tous, et non pour l'utilité particuliere de ceux à qui elle est confiée.'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout the nineteenth century, along with the technological advancement applied to the wars that led to increased mortality among combatants and damage to civilian populations during conflicts, movements for humanitarian awareness in Western societies resulted in the founding of the first humanitarian organizations such as the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] in 1859 and the first international typifications of abuses and crimes&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Commission on Human Rights, E / CN.4 / 2002/71, 8 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; or laws of war known as Geneva Conventions from 1864. After the [[Second World War Hangar No. 7|Second World War]], in 1946 the [[Nuremberg trials]] brought to the public attention the breadth of the [[Nacht und Nebel]] decree, one of the most prominent antecedents of the crime, by 20 of which the Nazi regime of [[Adolf Hitler]] stopped and condemned death to persons in the occupied territories of Europe considered a threat to the security of the [[Third Reich]]. However, the executions were not carried out immediately, once the people were transported to camps in Germany, such as the Struthof-Natzweiler Field, where they ended up disappearing, and no information about their whereabouts and fate was notified as per point III of decree:&lt;blockquote&gt;III. ... In case German or foreign authorities inquire about such prisoners, they are to be told that they were arrested, but that the proceedings do not allow any further information.&lt;ref&gt;Office of United States Chief of Counsel for Prosecution of Axis Criminality, Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, 8 vols. and 2 suppl. vols.VII, 873-874 (Doc. No. L-90)Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1946-1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

German Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] was the person condemned in connection with his role in the application of the "NN decree" by Adolf Hitler, although, as at that time it had not yet been accepted that enforced disappearances were part of the concept of crimes against humanity, the International Criminal Tribunal in Nuremberg found him guilty of war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;E/CN.4/2002/71 page 37
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1974, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] have been the first international human rights bodies to react to the phenomenon of disappearances, following complaints made in connection with cases Chile since the military coup of September 11, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, 1974 OEA / Ser.L / V / II.34, Doc.31, Rev.1, of December 30, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The report of the Working Group to Investigate the Situation of Human Rights in that country, which was submitted to the United Nations Commission on 4 February 1976, illustrated for the first time such a case, the one of Alphonse-René Chanfreau, of French origin, arrested in July 1974 at his home in Santiago de Chile.

Earlier, in February 1975, the UN Commission on Human Rights had for the first time used the term ''persons unaccounted for'', "persons whose disappearance was not justified", in a resolution that dealt with disappearances in Cyprus as a result of the armed conflict that resulted in the division of the island,&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 4 (XXXI) of the Commission on Human Rights of 13 February 1975&lt;/ref&gt; an expression taken together with that of missing people, in the two General Assembly resolutions adopted in December 1975 with respect to Cyprus and Chile.&lt;ref&gt;General Assembly resolution 3450 (XXX) of 9 December 1975. General Assembly resolution 3448 (XXX) of 9 December 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1977 and 1979 resolutions ===
In 1977, the General Assembly of the United Nations again manifested itself in relation to disappearances in its resolution 32/118.&lt;ref&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the Assembly expresses ... its special concern and indignation at the incessant disappearance of persons who, according to available evidence, can be attributed to political reasons and to the refusal of the Chilean authorities to accept their responsibility for the large number of Persons under such conditions or to explain it, or even to conduct an adequate investigation of the cases that have been brought to their attention." General Assembly resolution 32/118 of 16 December 1977, para. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the Nobel Prize winner Adolfo Pérez Esquivel had made an international appeal that with the support of the French government&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Febbro, ''[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/subnotas/68730-22331-2006-06-20.html Una iniciativa de Argentina y de Francia con historia accidentada].'' El Pais, June 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; which obtained the response of the General Assembly in the form of resolution 33/173 of 20 December 1978, which specifically referred to "missing persons" and requested the Commission on Human Rights to make appropriate recommendations.

On 6 March 1979, the Commission authorized the appointment as experts of Dr. Felix Ermacora and Waleed M. Sadi, who later resigned due to political pressure,&lt;ref&gt;E/CN.4/2002/71 page 10&lt;/ref&gt; to study the question of the fate of disappearances in Chile, issuing a report to the General Assembly on November 21, 1979. Felix Ermacora's report became a reference point on the legal issue of crime by including a series of conclusions and recommendations which were later collected by international organizations and bodies.&lt;ref&gt;A / 34/583 / Add.1 21 November 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, during the same year, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States adopted a resolution on Chile on October 31, in which it declared that the practice of disappearances was "an affront to the conscience of the hemisphere",&lt;ref&gt;OEA AG/Rev.443 (IX-0/79), para. 3&lt;/ref&gt; after having sent in September a mission of the Inter-American Commission to Argentina, which confirmed the systematic practice of enforced disappearances by successive military juntas. In spite of the exhortations of non-governmental organizations and family organizations of the victims, in the same resolution of October 31, 1979, the General Assembly of the OAS issued a statement, after receiving pressure from the Argentine government, in which only the states in which persons had disappeared were urged to refrain from enacting or enforcing laws that might hinder the investigation of such disappearances.&lt;ref&gt;OEA, AG/Res. 443 (IX-0/79), para. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the report by Félix Ermacora, the UN Commission on Human Rights considered one of the proposals made and decided on 29 February 1980 to set up the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the first of the so-called thematic mechanisms of the Commission and the most important body of the United Nations that has since been dealing with the problem of disappearances in cases that can be attributed to governments, as well as issuing recommendations to the Commission and governments on the improvement of the protection afforded to missing persons and their families and to prevent cases of enforced disappearance. Since then, different causes began to be developed in various international legal bodies, whose sentences served to establish a specific jurisprudence on enforced disappearance.

=== 1983 OAS resolution and first convictions ===
The United Nations Human Rights Committee, established in 1977 in accordance with article 28 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to monitor compliance by states parties with their obligations, issued in March 1982 and July 1983, two sentences condemning the State of Uruguay for the cases of Eduardo Bleier,&lt;ref&gt;Bleier v. Uruguay, comunication Nº 30/1978&lt;/ref&gt; a former member of the Communist Party of Uruguay, residing in Hungary and Israel, disappeared after his arrest in 1975 in Montevideo, and Elena Quinteros Almeida, missing since her arrest at the Venezuelan Embassy in Montevideo in June 1976, in an incident that led to the suspension of diplomatic relations between the two countries. In its judgments, the Committee relied on a number of articles of the International Covenant, in particular those relating to "the right to liberty and personal security", "the right of detainees to be treated humanely and with respect to the inherent dignity of the human being" and "the right of every human being to the recognition of his juridical personality", while in the case of Quinteros, it was solved for the first time in favor of the relatives considered equally victims.

In 1983, the Organization of American States (OAS) declared by its resolution 666 XIII-0/83 that any enforced disappearance should be described as a crime against humanity. A few years later, in 1988 and 1989, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights pronounced the first convictions that declared the State of Honduras guilty for violating its duty to respect and guarantee the rights to life, liberty and personal integrity of the disappeared Angel Manfredo Velásquez Rodríguez, a Honduran student kidnapped in September 1981 in Tegucigalpa by heavily armed civilians connected with the Honduran Armed Forces and Saúl Godínez Cruz,&lt;ref&gt;Molina Theissen: Court I.D.H., Case of Velásquez Rodríguez, Judgment of July 29, 1988. Series C No. 4; And, Court I.D.H., Godínez Cruz Case, Judgment of January 20, 1989. Series C No. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; but for which, since the express definition of the crime of enforced disappearance had not yet been defined, it had to rely on different articles of the American Convention on Human Rights of 1969. Other rulings issued by the Inter-American Court that established jurisprudence condemned [[Colombian conflict|Colombia]],&lt;ref&gt;Case of Caballero-Delgado and Santana v. Colombia, complaint No. 10319/1989, judgment of December 8, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guatemala]] for several cases including the call of the "street children",&lt;ref&gt;Blake v. Guatemala, complaint No. 11219/1993, judgment of January 24, 1998. Villigran Morales y Alcase v. Guatemala, complaint No. 11383/1994, judgment of November 19, 1999. Bámaca Velásquez v. Guatemala, complaint No. 11129/1993, judgment of November 25, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peru]],&lt;ref&gt;Durán and Ugarte v. Peru, Complaints Num. 10009 and 10078/1987, judgment of August 16, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref&gt;Trujillo Oroza v. Bolivia, judgment of January 26, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Situation in Europe and resolutions of 1993 and 1995 ===
In Europe, the European Court of Human Rights, established in 1959, in accordance with article 38 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 1950, became a single permanent and binding court For all the Member States of the Council of Europe. Although the European Convention does not contain any express prohibition of the practice of enforced disappearance, the Court dealt with several cases of disappearance in 1993 in the context of the conflict between the Turkish security forces and members or supporters of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) from the Kurdish region to the southeast of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;E / CN.4 / 2002/71 pag. 20-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Another body providing the basis for the legal definition of the crime of enforced disappearance was the Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina, a human rights tribunal established under Annex 6 of the Dayton Peace Agreement of 14 December 1995 which, although it was declared incompetent by ratione temporis to deal with the majority of the 20,000 cases reported, it issued a number of sentences against the Serbian Republic of Bosnia&lt;ref&gt;Palic v. Republika Srpska, Case No. CH / 99/3196, decision on admissibility and merits, 11 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,&lt;ref&gt;Unkovic v. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Case No. CH / 99/2150, decision on admissibility and merits of 9 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; which compensated several families of disappeared persons.

=== Towards the 1992 International Convention ===
In parallel with the resolutions of the international organizations, several non-governmental organizations drafted projects for an international convention. In 1981, the ''Institut des droits de l'homme du Barreau de Paris'' (Institute of Human Rights of the Paris Law School) organized a high-level symposium to promote an international convention on disappearances, followed by several draft declarations and conventions proposed by the Argentine League for Human Rights, FEDEFAM at the annual congress of Peru in 1982 or the ''Colectivo de Abogados José Alvear Restepo'' from Bogotá in 1988.

In that same year, the French expert in the then Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, Louis Joinet, prepared the draft text to be adopted in 1992 by the General Assembly with the title Declaration on the Protection of All Persons Against enforced disappearances. The definition presented was based on the one traditionally used by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. Although the Declaration included as the primary obligation of States to enact specific criminal legislation, unlike the Convention against Torture, the principle of universal jurisdiction was not established nor was it agreed that the provisions of the Declaration and the recommendations of the Working Group were legally binding, so that only a few states took concrete steps to comply with them.&lt;ref&gt;Colombia, Guatemala, Paraguay, Perú y Venezuela. E/CN.4/2002/71, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Declaration, despite its shortcomings, served to awaken the regional project for the American continent commissioned by the OAS General Assembly in 1987, which, although drafted by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 1988, it was subjected to lengthy discussions and modifications that resulted in their stagnation. In June 1994, the OAS General Assembly finally approved the Inter-American Convention on the Forced Disappearance of Persons, which would be the first legally binding instrument on the subject, and entered into force on March 28, 1996,&lt;ref&gt;E/CN.4/2002/71 page 28&lt;/ref&gt; after its ratification by eight countries: Argentina, Panama, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Venezuela, Bolivia and Guatemala.

In view of the meager success of the United Nations Declaration, a non-binding instrument that could only marginally influence the practice of enforced disappearances, a number of non-governmental organizations and several experts proposed strengthening protection against disappearances, adopting a convention within the framework of the United Nations. This was followed by the deliberations of the 1981 Paris Colloquium submitted by Louis Joinet in the form of a draft subcommittee in August 1988. Several governments, international organizations and non-governmental organizations responded to the invitation of Secretary-General Kofi Annan to provide comments and observations to the project.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, E/CN.4/2001/69, December 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 2006 International Convention ===
On 20 December 2006, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the text of the International Convention on the Forced Disappearance of Persons after more than 25 years of development and was signed in Paris on February 6, 2007&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'' February 6, 2007, ''[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3220,36-864092,0.html?xtor=RSS-3210 Droits de l'homme : un traité international sur les disparitions forcées]''&lt;/ref&gt; at a ceremony to which representatives of the 53 first signatory countries attended and in which 20 of them immediately ratified it. On April 19, 2007, the Commission on Human Rights updated the list of countries that ratified the Convention, which included 59 nations.

== Report of the UN (1980–2009) ==
Since the establishment of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (CHR) in 1980, the crime of enforced disappearance has proved to be a global problem, affecting many countries on five continents, and it is the subject of a special follow-up by the HRC which regularly publishes reports on its complaint and situation, as well as the response and action of the governments concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ohchr.org/SP/Pages/Home.aspx|title=ACNUDH {{!}} Inicio|website=ohchr.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report of the 2009 Working Group recorded a total of 53,232 cases transmitted by the Working Group to Governments since their inception in 1980 and affecting 82 States. The number of cases that are still under study due to lack of clarification, closed or discontinuous cases amounts to 42,600. Since 2004 the Working Group had clarified 1,776 cases. In the previous report of 2007, the number of cases had been 51,531 and affected 79 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Implementation of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 entitled "Human Rights Council" Template:&lt;nowiki&gt;Http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/262138/A{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; HRC 2 SR.3-ES.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the countries in the cases are affected internally by violent conflicts, while in other countries the practice of repressive policies towards political opponents is denounced. In other countries, generally in the western and European hemispheres, there are still historical cases that remain unresolved and constitute permanent crimes.

In the official UN report of 2009, of the 82 countries where the cases of missing persons were identified, the largest number (more than 1000) transmitted were:&lt;ref&gt;A/HRC/13/31.

===Algeria===
During the [[Algerian Civil War]], which began in 1992 as [[Islamist]] [[guerrilla]]s attacked the military government which had annulled an [[Front Islamique du Salut|Islamist electoral victory]], thousands of people were forcibly disappeared. Disappearances continued up to the late 1990s, but thereafter dropped off sharply with the decline in violence in 1997. Some of the disappeared were kidnapped or killed by the guerrillas, but others are presumed to have been taken by state security services. This latter group has become the most controversial. Their exact numbers remain disputed, but the government has acknowledged a figure of just over 6,000 disappeared, now presumed dead. Opposition sources claim the real number is closer to 17,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} (The war claimed a total toll of 150–200,000 deaths).

In 2005 [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation|a controversial amnesty law]] was approved in a referendum. It granted financial compensation to families of the "disappeared", but also effectively ended the police investigations into the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/04/14/algeri10485.htm |title=Algeria: Amnesty Law Risks Legalizing Impunity for Crimes Against Humanity (Human Rights Watch, 14-4-2005) |publisher=Hrw.org |date=13 April 2005 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Argentina]]'s [[Dirty War]] and [[Operation Condor]], many alleged political [[dissident]]s were abducted or illegally detained and kept in clandestine [[Detention Centers in the Dirty War|detention centers]] such as [[Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics|ESMA]], where they were questioned, tortured, and sometimes killed. Other detention camps include those of Garaje Azopardo and Orletti, to name just a few. These places of torture, located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed over 6,000 desaparecidos, or disappeared persons, to the overall count in the Dirty War. The victims would be shipped to places like a garage or basement and tortured day after day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Centros Clandestinos de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires|last = Goyochea|first = Agueda|publisher = Instituto Espacio para la Memoria|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Buenos Aires, Argentina|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disappeared ones were people who were considered to be a political or ideological threat to the military junta.&lt;ref name="Robben"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robben |first=Antonius C.

An activist group, [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]], was formed by mothers of the "disappeared" victims of the dictatorship. In addition a similar group was formed, [[Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo]], with the goal of finding the children stolen by the Argentine government during the Dirty War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Argentina's Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo awarded UNESCO peace prize |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37683 |publisher=UN News Centre |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was recognized by ''de facto'' President General [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] when he said in a press conference "They are neither dead nor alive, they are ''desaparecidos'' (missing)". It is thought that between 1976 and 1983 in Argentina, up to 30,000 people (8,960 named cases, according to the official report by the [[Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas|CONADEP]])&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031002040053/http://nuncamas.org/index2.htm |dead-url=yes |title=Nunca Más (Never Again): Report of CONADEP (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons) |chapter=Part VI: Recommendations and Conclusions: Conclusions |publisher=National Commission on the Disappeared ([[Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas|CONADEP]]) |date=September 1984 |access-date=13 January 2011  |chapter-url=http://nuncamas.org/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_283.htm |url=http://nuncamas.org/index2.htm |archive-date=2 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; were killed or disappeared. According to a declassified cable, an estimate by the Argentine 601st Intelligence Battalion in mid-July 1978 (which started counting victims in 1975) produced a figure of 22,000 persons killed or "disappeared"—this document was first published by John Dinges in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Luis Filipe |last=Alemparte Diaz |authorlink=Enrique Arancibia Clavel |section=Page A-8 |section-url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB185/19780715%20%5BReport%20on%20Argentina%27s%20dissappeared%5D%20A0000514c.pdf |title=Argentine Military Intelligence estimate on the number of disappeared |date=July 1978 |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB185/full%20%5BReport%20on%20Argentina%20disappeared%5D.pdf |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 opposition leaders [[Yury Zacharanka]] and [[Viktar Hanchar]] together with his business associate [[Anatol Krasouski]] disappeared. Hanchar and Krasouski disappeared the same day of a broadcast on state television in which President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] ordered the chiefs of his security services to crack down on "opposition scum." Although the [[State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus]] (KGB) had them under constant surveillance, the official investigation announced that the case could not be solved. The disappearance of journalist [[Dzmitry Zavadski]] in 2000 has also yielded no results. Copies of a report by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=16 Years of Silence: Enforced Disappearances in Belarus Must Be Investigated |url=http://blog.amnestyusa.org/europe/16-years-of-silence-enforced-disappearances-in-belarus-must-be-investigated/  | newspaper=[[Amnesty International]]|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
The President of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 8 April 1994, [[Alija Izetbegović]], signed an act that allowed the army and the intelligence services to carry out forced disappearances to spread terror and demoralize Serbs fighters in the [[War of Bosnia]]. In response to this act, the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] created the 125th Battalion that, along with the ICSR (Informativni Centar za Spas Republike, the former intelligence service of the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), was responsible for the kidnap, torture and disappearance through death flights of captured Serb fighters in the war. [[Mostar Airport]] was used, during the war, to detain disappeared people. The [[ICTY]] estimated that "Almost 1,800 people disappeared during the war for the persecution carry out by the Croats, Serbs and Bosniaks war authorities"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kupreskic/tjug/en/kup-tj000114e-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately after the military's [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|seizure of power]] on 11 September 1973, the Chilean [[military junta]] banned all the leftist parties that had constituted the democratically elected president [[Salvador Allende]]'s UP coalition.&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stern|first=Steve J.|title=Remembering Pinochet's Chile|publisher=Duke University Press|location=30 September 2004|pages=32, 90, 101, 180–81|isbn=0-8223-3354-6}}, accessed 10-24-2006 through Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; All other parties were placed in "indefinite recess", and were later banned outright. The regime's violence was directed not only against dissidents, but also against their families and other civilians.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt; [See: ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]'' (1982)]

The [[Rettig Report]] concluded 2,279 persons who disappeared during the military dictatorship were killed for political reasons or as a result of political violence, and approximately 31,947 tortured according to the later [[Valech Report]], while 1,312 were exiled. The latter were chased all over the world by the intelligence agencies. In Latin America, this was made under the auspices of [[Operation Condor]], a combined operation between the intelligence agencies of various South American countries, assisted by a United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) communication base in Panama. Pinochet justified these operations as being necessary in order to save the country from communism.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Gallardo, [http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=2714962 Pinochet Was Unrepentant to the End], [[ABC News]] ([[Associated Press]]), 11 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political scientists have ascribed the relative bloodiness of the coup to the stability of the existing democratic system, which required extreme action to overturn. Some of the most famous cases of human rights violations occurred during the early period: in October 1973, at least 70 people were killed throughout the country by the [[Caravan of Death]]. [[Charles Horman]], a US journalist, "disappeared", as did [[Víctor Olea Alegría]], a member of the [[Chilean Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], and many others, in 1973.

Furthermore, many other important officials of Allende's government were tracked down by the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional]] (DINA&amp;mdash;the Chilean secret police) during Operation Condor. Thus, General [[Carlos Prats]], Pinochet's predecessor and army commander under Allende, who had resigned rather than support the moves against Allende's government, was assassinated by a [[car bomb]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], in 1974. A year later, the deaths of 119 opponents abroad was claimed as the product of infighting between Marxist factions, the DINA setting up a disinformation campaign to propagate this thesis, [[Operation Colombo]]. The campaign was legitimized and supported by the leading newspaper in Chile, ''[[El Mercurio]]''.

Other victims of Condor included, among hundreds of less famous persons, [[Juan José Torres]], the former President of Bolivia, assassinated in Buenos Aires on 2 June 1976; [[Carmelo Soria]], a UN diplomat working for the [[CEPAL]], assassinated in July 1976; and [[Orlando Letelier]], a former Chilean [[ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]] to the United States and minister in Allende's cabinet, [[Letelier assassination|assassinated]] after his release from internment and exile in Washington, D.C. by a car bomb on 21 September 1976. This led to strained relations with the US and to the extradition of [[Michael Townley]], a US citizen who worked for the DINA and had organized Letelier's assassination. Other targeted victims, who escaped assassination, included Christian-Democrat politician [[Bernardo Leighton]], who barely escaped an assassination attempt in Rome in 1975 by the Italian neo-fascist terrorist [[Stefano delle Chiaie]] (the assassination attempt seriously injured Leighton and his wife, Anita Fresno, leaving her permanently disabled); [[Carlos Altamirano]], the leader of the Chilean Socialist Party, targeted for murder in 1975 by Pinochet, along with [[Volodia Teitelboim]], writer and member of the Communist Party; [[Pascal Allende]], the nephew of Salvador Allende and president of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]], who escaped an assassination attempt in Costa Rica in March 1976; and US Congressman [[Edward Koch]], who became aware in 2001 of the relationship between death threats he received and his denunciation of Operation Condor. Furthermore, according to current investigations, [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], the Christian Democrat President of Chile from 1964 to 1970, may have been poisoned in 1982 by a toxin produced by DINA biochemist [[Eugenio Berrios]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6289209.stm Ex-Chilean leader 'was murdered'], [[BBC]], 23 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Berríos himself is reputed to having been assassinated by Chilean intelligence in Uruguay, after being spirited away to said country in the early 1990s.

Protests continued, however, during the 1980s, leading to several scandals. In March 1985, the [[Caso Degollados|gruesome murder]] of three [[Communist Party of Chile]] (PCC) members led to the resignation of [[César Mendoza]], head of the Chilean [[gendarmerie]] the [[Carabineros de Chile]] and member of the ''junta'' since its formation. During a 1986 protest against Pinochet, 21-year-old American photographer [[Rodrigo Rojas DeNegri]] and 18-year-old student [[Carmen Gloria Quintana]] were [[Burnt Alive case|burnt alive]], killing Rojas.

In August 1989, Marcelo Barrios Andres, a 21-year-old member of the [[Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front]] (FPMR, the armed wing of the PCC, created in 1983, which had attempted to assassinate Pinochet on 7 September 1986), was assassinated by a group of military personnel who were supposed to arrest him on orders of Valparaíso's public prosecutor.

Enforced disappearance have been employed by the Egyptian authorities under the regime of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as a key instrument to terrify, interrogate and torture El-Sisi opponents, while using counter-terrorism as an excuse.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/egypt/report-egypt/|title=Egypt 2017/2018|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of people forcibly disappeared including political activists, protesters, women and children.

378 individuals, including four women, have forcibly disappeared between 1 August 2016 and mid-August 2017. 291 people have been located, while the rest are still forcibly disappeared.

===El Salvador===
According to the [[United Nations Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances]], enforced disappearances were systematically carried out in El Salvador both prior to (starting in 1978) and during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]]. Salvadoran non-governmental organizations estimate that more than 8,000 disappearances occurred, and in the Report of the [[Commission on the Truth for El Salvador]], it is estimated that more than 5,500 persons may have been the victims of enforced disappearance. The Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights of El Salvador claims that
{{quote|Disappearances usually took place during operations whose purpose was the detention and later the disappearance or execution of persons identified as or suspected of being government opponents, including civilians who had nothing to do with the conflict, with the apparent aim of generating terror and eliminating members of the population who might potentially become guerrillas.}}

===Germany===
{{Main|Nacht und Nebel}}

During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] set up secret police forces, including branches of the [[Gestapo]] in occupied countries, which they used to hunt down known or suspected dissidents or partisans. This tactic was given the name ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' (''Night and Fog''), to describe those who disappeared after being arrested by Nazi forces without any warning. The Nazis also applied this policy against political opponents within Germany. Most victims were [[summary execution|killed on the spot]], or sent to [[concentration camp]]s, with the full expectation that they would then be killed.

===Guatemala===

[[Guatemala]] was one of the first countries where people were disappeared as a generalized practice of terror against a civilian population. Forced disappearances was widely practiced by the United States-backed military government of Guatemala during the 36-year [[Guatemalan Civil War]].&lt;ref name=McAllister&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=McAllister|first=Carlota|authorlink=|editor-first1=Greg|editor-last1=Grandin|editor-first2=Gilbert|editor-last2=Joseph|editor-link=|encyclopedia=A Century of Revolution|title=A Headlong Rush into the Future|accessdate=14 January 2014|year=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|doi=|pages=276–309|quote=|ref={{harvid|McAllister|2010}}|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YJ7ZBGy0wsIC|isbn=978-0-8223-9285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 40,000 to 50,000 individuals were disappeared by the Guatemalan military and security forces between 1954 and 1996. The tactic of disappearance first saw widespread use in Guatemala during the mid-1960s, as government repression became widespread when the military adopted harsher counterinsurgency measures. The first documented case of forced disappearance by the government in Guatemala occurred in March 1966, when thirty [[Guatemalan Party of Labour]] associates were kidnapped, tortured and killed by the security forces; their bodies were put in sacks and dumped at sea from helicopters. This was one of the first major instances of forced disappearance in Latin American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB11/docs/|title=U.S. POLICY IN GUATEMALA, 1966–1996|work=gwu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; When law students at the University of San Carlos used legal measures (such as ''[[habeas corpus]]'' petitions) to require the government to present the detainees at court, some of the students were "disappeared" in turn.&lt;ref&gt;(McClintock 1985: 82–83; CIIDH and GAM 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
{{Main|Causeway Bay Books disappearances}}
{{Expand section|date=January 2016}}

On the evening of December 30, 2015, a [[Hong Kong]] citizen Lee Bo (李波), disappeared.  His wife shortly received a phone call from him (with caller ID from Shenzhen across the border with mainland China) in which he explained in Mandarin (not Cantonese which they'd usually converse in) he had to assist with some investigation for a while, and he could not be home nor provide more information for a while.  Lee Bo was a co-owner of the Causeway Bay Books and the Might Current publishing house that specialized in selling books concerning the political gossip and other lurid subjects of the Chinese Communist party leaders.  These books were banned from China, and were popular among the numerous Chinese tourists visiting Hong Kong.  Towards the end of October, 2015, four co-owners and managers of the bookstore and publisher, Gui Minhai (桂民海), Lui Bo (呂波), Cheung Jiping (張志平), and Lam Wingkei (林榮基), went missing from Thailand and mainland China, believed to be detained by law enforcement in China.  Lee Bo had expressed concern of his safety in various interviews after his colleagues disappeared, and intentionally left all travel documents at home (confirmed by his wife to be the case after his disappearance).  Lee Bo was a dual citizen of Hong Kong and the United Kingdom.

Lee Bo's disappearance drew wide attention, since it was widely believed he was abducted and brought into mainland China.  The disappearance of all 5 men were speculated to be connected to some upcoming news releases that would have embarrassed the Communist party.  Hong Kong citizens, under the [[One country, two systems|one-country two-system]] configuration, are supposedly to be protected by the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]] in that law enforcement from China cannot operate in the special administrative region (SAR), and most laws in China do not apply.  Lee's disappearance was considered a threat to freedom of press and most importantly the many rights, freedom, and protection promised to Hong Kong citizens often denied in mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4170605/lee-bo-disappearance-bookseller-china-hong-kong/|title=Hong Kong: Missing Booksellers Spark Deep Anxiety|work=TIME.com|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hong Kong bookstore disappearances shock publishing industry - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34782266|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2016-01-08|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Case of the Missing Hong Kong Book Publishers|url = http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-case-of-the-missing-hong-kong-book-publishers|website = The New Yorker|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report by Ensaaf and HRDAG, "Violent Deaths and Enforced Disappearances During the Counterinsurgency in Punjab, India", presents empirical findings suggesting that the intensification of [[counterinsurgency]] operations in Punjab in the 1980s to 1990s was accompanied by a shift in state violence from targeted lethal human rights violations to systematic enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions, accompanied by mass "illegal cremations".&lt;ref name="ensaaf2009"/&gt; Furthermore, there is key evidence suggesting security forces tortured, executed, and disappeared tens of thousands of people in Punjab from 1984 to 1995.&lt;ref name="ensaaf2009"/&gt;

According to National Commission of Human Rights ([http://www.cndh.org.mx/ CNDH]), between 2006 and 2011, 5,397 people have disappeared. Of these, 3,457 are men, 1,885 are women, but there is no information about the other 55 (source [http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2011/04/110402_mexico_desaparecidos_comision_derechos_humanos_fp.shtml BBC]).
Usually the forced disappearances occur in groups and are on people not related to the [[Mexican Drug War|drug war]] which was started by President [[Felipe Calderón]] in 2006. The main difference from the kidnappings, is that usually there is no ransom asked for the disappeared.

Several Moroccan Army personnel suspected of being implicated in the 1970s coups against the King were held in secret detention camps such as [[Tazmamart]], where some of them died due to poor conditions or lack of medical treatment.
The most famous case of forced disappearance in Morocco is that of political dissident [[Mehdi Ben Barka]], who disappeared in obscure circumstances in France in 1965.
In February 2007, Morocco signed an international convention protecting people against forced disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/dis070207mc |title=Finally tackling the threat of 'disappearance' – Radio Netherlands Worldwide – English |publisher=Radionetherlands.nl |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.map.ma/fr/sections/boite4/la_signature_par_le/view |access-date=7 February 2007}}{{dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amina Masood Janjua]], a human right's activist and chairperson of [http://www.dhrpk.org Defence of Human Rights Pakistan]; a not for profit organization working against enforced disappearance there are more than 5000 reported cases of enforced disappearance in Pakistan. There are no formal allegations or charges against the persons thus forcefully disappeared. The systematic practice of enforced disappearance in Pakistan originated in the era of military dictator General [[Pervez Musharraf]].
The number above does not include the disappearances in Balochistan where Human Rights Organisation working for the safe release of Baloch enforced-disappeared persons in Balochistan put the number of disappeared Baloch 20,000 – 25,000 since the year 2000 when the current phase of Baloch liberation struggle started.

The [[Russian government]] failed to pursue any accountability process for [[human rights abuses]] committed during the course of the conflict in Chechnya. Unable to secure justice domestically, hundreds of victims of abuse have filed applications with the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR).

==== Estimate of the ''Desaparecidos del franquismo'' ====

Identification and systematic analysis of the bones of victims in mass graves have not yet, to date, been undertaken by any government of the current Spanish democracy (since 1977).

According to ''[[La Nueva España]]'' newspaper, the data of people buried in mass graves brought before the ''Audiencia Nacional'' court on 16 October 2008 are the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lne.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=2008101600_43_686147__Espana-Hubo-114266-desaparecidos-entre-1936-1951-segun-auto-juez-Garzon|work= La Nueva España|title=Report|date=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
{{Main|Enforced disappearances in Sri Lanka}}
According to a United Nations 1999 study, [[Sri Lanka]] is the country that has the second highest number of disappeared people in the world (the first being Iraq). Since 1980, 12,000 Sri Lankans have gone missing after being detained by security forces. More than 55,000 people have been killed in the past 27 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/306447.stm | work=BBC News | title=Sri Lanka's disappeared thousands | date=28 March 1999 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are still lower than the then-current Sri Lankan government's 2009 estimate of 17,000 people missing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2009statements/2093/ |title=SRI LANKA: Registers on entry and leaving of internally displaced persons needs to be created urgently to prevent forced disappearances |publisher=Ahrchk.net |date=16 June 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was made after it came to power with a commitment to correct the human rights issues.

In 2003, the [[International Red Cross]] (ICRC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2780733.stm | work=BBC News | title=Red Cross tackles war missing | date=19 February 2003 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; restarted investigations into the disappearance of 11,000 people during Sri Lanka's civil war.

On 29 May 2009, the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' acquired confidential U.N. documents that record nearly 7,000 civilian deaths in the no-fire zone up to the end of April. The toll then surged, the paper quoted unidentified U.N. sources as saying, with an average of 1,000 civilians killed each day until 19 May, when the government declared victory over the [[Tamil Tiger]] rebels. That means the final death toll is more than 20,000, ''The Times'' said. "Higher", a U.N. source told the paper. "Keep going." The United Nations has previously said 7,000 civilians were killed in fighting between January and May. A top Sri Lankan official called the 20,000 figure unfounded. Gordon Weiss, a U.N. spokesman in Sri Lanka, told [[CNN]] that a large number of civilians were killed, though he did not confirm the 20,000 figure.

US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] has accused&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/world/asia/23lanka.html | work=The New York Times | title=U.S. Faults Sri Lanka on Civilian Woes | first=Somini | last=Sengupta | date=23 April 2009 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Lanka of "causing untold suffering".

=== Switzerland ===
In 2007, the Swiss government detained without charge an Egyptian refugee [[Mohamed El Ghanem]].  The family of El Ghanem, and El Ghanam himself claim that the detention was in retaliation for El Ghanem's filing charges against the Swiss Police for threatening him to become a spy-informant on the local Muslim community.  Pending 2006, the Swiss government ran administrative and judicial procedures against El Ghanem in his absence, claiming he was mentally incompetent and dangerous, but refused him proper treatment.  The Swiss government refused to tell his U.S.-based family where he was, or to admit his detention.  In 2009, British journalist Robert Fisk noted that El Ghanem was "disappeared", in light of the fact that the Swiss government was refusing to acknowledge his whereabouts.  In 2010, lawyers for El Ghanem presented the case to the UN Committee on Forced and Voluntary Disappearances. In 2013, the Swiss Federal Tribunal ruled that El Ghanem's detention was wrongful, and that his complaints (re: alleged spy-recruitment) had never been adequately addressed.  {{as of|2013|November}}, El Ghanem remained in the local Geneva prison, Champ-Dollon.  His imminent release was expected. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Syria===
Cases of forced disappearance in Syria started when late Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]] started to face opposition from citizens in the late 1970s.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} While he was able to buy elite merchants of [[Damascus]] through Badr el-Deen Shallah, the general public was outraged by Assad's policies in ruling the country and the rise of corruption.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} From then on, any voice opposing or questioning the Syrian government was silenced by forced disappearance or threats.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  According to Human Rights Watch, no fewer than 17,000 people disappeared during Assad's 30-year rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/07/16/wasted-decade ''Wasted Decade: Human Rights in Syria during [[Bashar al-Asad]]'s First Ten Years in Power''], [[Human Rights Watch]], 2010 Report&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bashar al-Assad]] took his father's policy further and considered any voice questioning anything about Syria's political, economical, social, or otherwise policies should be monitored and when needed, detained and accused of weakening national empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10338256|title=Syrian President Bashar al-Assad: Facing down rebellion|date=2015-10-21|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent case is [[Tal Mallohi]], a 19-year-old blogger summoned for interrogation on 27 December 2009 who was released over 4 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140211-tal-al-mallohi-is-free-the-syrian-people-triumph/|title=Tal al-Mallohi is free, the Syrian people triumph|date=2014-02-11|work=Middle East Monitor|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, [[Amnesty International]] released a report accusing the [[Syrian government]] and its allied militants of kidnapping tens of thousands people since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ara.reuters.com/article/topNews/idARAKCN0SU05R20151105|title = منظمة العفو الدولية تدين عمليات اختفاء قسري في سوريا|date = November 5, 2015|accessdate = November 25, 2015|website = Reuters |language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international organization said that such acts represent a crime against humanity. The organization called Syrian government to allow the entry of the [[UN]]'s international committee of inquiry observers in order to access information related to the detainees.

Amnesty International has claimed that more than 65,000 people, mostly [[civilians]], have been forcibly disappeared between March 2011 and August 2015.

The Syrian government, on the other hand, has repeatedly denied reports accused it committing crimes against humanity.

=== Palestinian territories ===
In August 2015, four members of [[Hamas]] Armed wing were abducted in [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], [[Egypt]]. They were abducted by unidentified gunmen according to the Egyptian security officials. The abducted men were in a bus carrying fifty of the Palestinians from [[Rafah]], to [[Cairo International Airport|Cairo airport]].

[[Hamas]] confirmed that the four abducted [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] were heading to [[Cairo]]. The spokesman of the [[interior ministry]] Iyad al Bazom said" "We urge the Egyptian interior ministry to secure the lives of the kidnapped passengers and free them". Until the moment, no group claimed their responsibility for the kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Four Palestinian Hamas militants abducted in Egypt's Sinai - sources|url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/08/20/uk-egypt-palestinians-kidnapping-idUKKCN0QO2CR20150820|website = Reuters UK|accessdate = 2015-11-28|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
On 12 March 2004, [[Somchai Neelapaijit]], a well-known [[Thai people|Thai]] [[Muslim]] activist lawyer in the kingdom's southern region, was kidnapped by Thai police and has since disappeared. Officially listed as a disappeared person, his presumed widow, Mrs. Ankhana Neelapaichit, has been seeking justice for her husband since Somchai first went missing. On 11 March 2009, Mrs. Neelapaichit was part of a special panel at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand to commemorate her husband's disappearance and to keep attention focused on the case and on human rights abuses in [[Thailand]].

In 2013, ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' reported that "Angkhana Neelapaijit, wife of missing lawyer Somchai, said the government's policies against drug trafficking and the southern insurgency had contributed to incidents of enforced disappearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/356448/govt-urged-to-tackle-tate-killings |title=Govt urged to tackle 'state killings'|work=Bangkok Post|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
Turkish human rights groups accuse the Turkish security forces of being responsible for the disappearance of more than 1,500{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dirittiglobali.it/2018/07/los-desaparecidos-the-disappeared-turkish-style/|title=Los Desaparecidos – The Disappeared Turkish-Style - Diritti Globali|date=2018-07-19|work=Diritti Globali|access-date=2018-11-15|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;civilians of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] minority in the 1980s and 1990s, in attempts to root out the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]]. Every week on Saturdays since 1995, [[Saturday Mothers]] hold silent vigil / sit-in protests to demand that their lost ones be found and those responsible be brought to justice. Each year [[Yakay-Der]], the Turkish Human Rights Association (İHD) and the International Committee Against Disappearances (ICAD), organise a series of events in Turkey to mark the "Week of Disappeared People".

In April 2009, state prosecutors in Turkey ordered the excavation of several sites around Turkey believed to hold Kurdish victims of state death squads from the 1980s and 1990s, in response to calls for Turkey's security establishment to come clean about past abuses.

In a study published in June 2017 by Sweden-based Stockholm Center for Freedom, 12 individual cases of enforced disappearances in Turkey since 2016 were documented under the emergency rule. The research titled as "[https://stockholmcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Enforced-Dissappearences-in-Turkey_22_June_2017.pdf Enforced Disappearances in Turkey]" claimed that all cases were connected to clandestine elements within Turkish security forces. Turkish authorities were reluctant to investigate the cases despite pleas from family members.&lt;ref&gt;https://stockholmcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Enforced-Dissappearences-in-Turkey_22_June_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
During the [[War in Donbass]] there had been many cases of forced disappearances on the territory of the so-called [[Donetsk People's Republic]]. The DPR leader [[Alexander Zakharchenko]] said that his forces detained up to five "Ukrainian subversives" each day. It was estimated that about 632 people were under illegal detention by separatist forces on 11 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/9thOHCHRreportUkraine.pdf#sthash.HFQs2pv2.dpuf|title=Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine: 1 December 2014 to 15 February 2015|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|date=2 March 2015|accessdate=3 March 2015|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2017 the freelance journalist [[Stanislav Aseyev]] was abducted. Firstly the de facto DNR government denied knowing his whereabouts but on July 16, an agent of the DNR's "Ministry of State Security" confirmed that Aseyev was in their custody and that he is suspected of "espionage". Independent media is not allowed to report from the "DNR"-controlled territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/2017-07/FI16017_2.pdf?TRhWAnU9V9A389Kj6RGAvval.yqFVY_j | title=URGENT ACTION: IMPRISONED JOURNALIST MUST BE RELEASED | publisher=Amnesty International | date=21 July 2017 | accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
According to [[Amnesty International]] ("AI"), the United States has engaged in forced disappearance of prisoners of war in the course of its [[War on Terror]]. AI lists at "least 39 detainees, all of whom are still missing, who are believed to have been held in secret sites run by the United States government overseas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Off the Record: U.S. Responsibility for Enforced Disappearances in the 'War on Terror'|publisher=Amnesty International|date=7 June 2007|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR51/093/2007/en|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA: Torture, War Crimes, Accountability: Visit to Switzerland of Former U.S. President George W.

The [[United States Department of Defense]] kept the identity of the individuals it held in [[Gitmo|Guantanamo]] secret, from its opening, on 11 January 2002, to 20 April 2006.&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe060123/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nytimes2006-02-26"/&gt;
An official list of the 558 individuals then held in the camp was published on 20 April 2006, in response to a court order from the [[United States District Judge]] [[Jed Rakoff]].  Another list, ostensibly of all 759 individuals who had been held in Guantanamo, was published on 20 May 2006.&lt;ref name=DoDList2/&gt;

The plane was also used by their new airline the [[Ford Air Transport Service]], which started regular flights in April. The Flights out of [[Ford Airport (Dearborn)]] cross-marketed, and showcased Ford's new interest in aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Public Image of Henry Ford An American Folk Hero and His Company|author=David L.

==1926 National Air Tour==
The 1926 Air tour started at Ford Field on August 7, 1926. The event featured the unveiling of the prototype [[Ford Flivver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Sport Aviation|date=July 1961|author=Robert F. Pauley|title=The Ford Flivver}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a field of 25 contestants. A new scoring system for time to "stick" and "unstick" aircraft to the ground helped promote the use of brakes which were unpopular at the time.

The new [[Ford Trimotor]] had a prop failure that shook loose one landing gear and an engine on one side. The plane landed hard in a field at [[Nova, Ohio]]. [[Walter Beech]] won in a Travel Air aircraft.&lt;ref name="Forden, Lesley 1931"&gt;Forden, Lesley. ''The Ford Air Tours: 1925–1931.''

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following comes from a New York paper:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The second day of the 1931 National Air Tour for the "Edsel B. Ford Trophy" today, was to find the 14 competing planes and a dozen accompanying planes en route from [[Le Roy (town), New York|Le Roy, New York]], to [[Binghamton, New York]]. From Binghamton, the tour is to fly south and west as far as [[San Antonio, Texas]], returning to Ford Airport July 25, 1931. A holiday crowd of about 5,000 persons witnessed the start of the tour from the Ford Airport Saturday morning. Colonel [[Clarence M. Young]], assistant Secretary of Commerce for Aeronautics, came from [[Cleveland, Ohio]] to witness the start. Fifteen Army planes from [[Selfridge Field]] stunted over the field just before the takeoff and accompanied the tour planes as far as Walker Airport, [[Walkerville, Ontario]] At Walker Airport, where the tour planes stopped for a long luncheon hour, they joined the large number of planes participating in the Trans-Canada Air Pageant there. Most of the racers got off to a bad start from Ford Airport. Only flying a [[Mercury Chic]], Captain [[William Lancaster (aviator)|William Lancaster]], flying a Bird and [[Eddie August Schneider|Eddie Schneider]], flying a [[Cessna]], got away on time. Leonard Flo, flying a Bird cabin plane, was delayed more than a half-hour when he broke a tail skid just before the takeoff and the two Ford entries were 15 minutes late. The racers were timed from the minute they were supposed to take off. Other entries are [[Charles F. Sugg]], Captain [[Walter Henderson (aviator)|Walter Henderson]] and [[Jack Story]], flying [[Buhl Aircraft Company|Buhl]] entries; [[James H. Smart]] and Harry Russell, flying Ford trimotors; Joseph Meehan, flying a Great Lakes; Lowell Bayles, flying a [[Granville Brothers Aircraft|Gee Bee]]; [[Eddie Stinson]], flying a Stinson and [[George Dickson]], flying an [[Aeronca]]. Among the well-known pilots flying accompanying planes are Major [[James H. Doolittle]], referee of the tour, who is accompanied by Mrs. Doolittle and Mrs. Ray W. Brown, wife of the assistant tour starter; Capt. Lewis A. Yancey, who flew with [[Roger Q. Williams]] across the Atlantic in 1928, who is piloting an [[autogiro]] in the tour; [[Walter E. Lees]], Detroit pilot who holds the world's non-refueling endurance record, and [[George Haldeman]], who attempted to fly the Atlantic with [[Ruth Elder]]. Major [[Thomas G. Lanphier, Sr.|Thomas G. Lanphier]], former commandant at [[Selfridge Field]], is accompanying the tour as far as Binghamton as a passenger. Night stops after tonight will be as follows: Monday, [[Bradford, Pennsylvania]]; Tuesday, [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]; Wednesday, [[Huntington, West Virginia]]; Thursday, [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]; Friday, [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; Saturday, [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; July 12, [[Montgomery, Alabama]]; July 13, [[New Orleans]]; July 14, [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]; July 15, [[Houston, Texas]]; July 16, [[San Antonio, Texas]]; July 17 and 18, [[Fort Worth, Texas]]; July 19, [[Ponca City, Oklahoma]]; July 20, [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]; July 21, [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]; July 22, [[Omaha, Nebraska]]; July 23, Davenport, Ia.; July 24, [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]]; July 25, [[Detroit, Michigan]]. The tour will cover more than 6,000 miles, visiting 18 states. The Ford Trophy will go to the pilot whose plane performs most efficiently, as judged by the scoring formula, over the entire distance. A separate trophy, the [[Great Lakes Light Plane Trophy]], will go to the pilot of the plane of less than 510 cubic inches engine displacement which makes the best score.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==2003 Re-creation==
[[Image:2003 National Air Tour.jpg|right|thumb|2003 National Air Tour route]]
The Tour was re-created in 2003 (September 8–24) from the plans for the canceled 1932 Tour. The 2003 Tour started and ended in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], circling the eastern half of the United States, with enroute layovers at [[Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina]] and Jabara Airport, [[Wichita, Kansas]] (Fri.-Mon., Sept. 12–15). More than 30 vintage aircraft took part. Most participating aircraft were from the same period of the original National Air Tours. The tour covered 4,000 miles and 27 cities.  The public was able to see a great many historic planes land and take off as well as ask questions and tour the inside of several of the larger planes.

'''Saint Godelieve''' (also known as '''Godeleva, Godeliève, Godelina''') ({{lang-nl|Sint-Godelieve}}) ({{circa}} 1052{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=45}} – 6 July 1070) is a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[saint]].{{sfn|Harper-Bill|1999|p=157}}

==Hagiography==
Tradition, as recorded in her ''Vita'', states that she was pious as a young girl, and became much sought after by suitors as a beautiful young woman. Godelieve, however, wanted to become a [[nun]]. A nobleman named Bertolf (Berthold) of [[Gistel]], however, determined to marry her, successfully invoked the help of her father's overlord, [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne]].{{sfn|Harper-Bill|1999|p=157}} Berthold's servants were ordered to provide only bread and water to the young bride.{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=45}}  Godelieve shared this food with the poor.{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=50}}

Godelieve managed to escape to the home of her father, Hemfrid, seigneur of [[Wierre-Effroy]].{{sfn|Harper-Bill|1999|p=157}}  Hemfrid, appealing to the [[Bishop of Tournai|Bishops of Tournai]] and [[Bishop of Soissons|Soissons]] and the [[Count of Flanders]], managed to have Bertolf restore Godelieve to her rightful position as his wife.

In July 1070, Godelieve returned to Gistel and soon after, at the order of Bertolf, was [[strangled]] by two servants and thrown into a pool,{{efn|Kienzle and Nienhuis state she was placed in her bed{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=45}}}}{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=45}} to make it appear as if she had died a [[natural death]].

==Legend==
According to legend, Bertolf married again, and had a daughter Edith, who was born [[blindness|blind]]: the legend  states that Edith was cured through the intercession of Saint Godelieve.{{sfn|Mulder-Bakker|2002|p=69}} Bertolf, now repentant of his crimes, went to [[Rome]] to obtain [[absolution]]. He went on a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]], and became a monk at St. Winnoc's Abbey at [[Bergues]].{{sfn|Mulder-Bakker|2002|p=69}} Edith founded a [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] at [[Gistel]], which was dedicated to Saint Godelieve, which she joined herself as a nun.{{sfn|Mulder-Bakker|2002|p=69}}

==Veneration==
Godelieve's body was [[exhumation|exhumed]] in 1084 by the Bishops of Tournai and [[Bishop of Noyon|Noyon]], in the presence of [[Gertrude of Saxony]], the wife of [[Robert I, Count of Flanders]], the Abbot of St. Winnoc's and a number of clergymen. It was Radbod II, bishop of Noyon-Tournai, that consecrated Godelieve's relics in 1084,{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=46}} and Godelieve's popular cult developed thereafter.{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=45-46}}

Drogo, a monk of St. Winnoc's Abbey, wrote Godelieve's biography, the ''Vita Godeliph'', about ten years after her death.{{sfn|Head|2001|p=359}} The abbey of [[Ten Putte Abbey]] in Bruges was dedicated to her,{{sfn|de Vries|2007|p=44}} and the name of the first Abbess was Agatha.{{sfn|Mulder-Bakker|2002|p=69}}

Every year, on the Sunday following 5 July, a [[procession]] celebrating Saint Godelieve takes place in Gistel.

Godelieve's [[feast day]], 6 July, was, like that of [[Swithun|Saint Swithun]] in England and [[Medardus|Saint Medard]] in France, connected with the [[weather]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicculture.org/lit/activities/view.cfm?id=1133&lt;/ref&gt; She is thus considered one of the "weather saints."

==The Godelieve Polyptych==
Godelieve's life is represented in the Godelieve Polyptych, now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/110001475&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Depression''' was a severe worldwide [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] that took place mostly during the 1930s, beginning [[Great Depression in the United States|in the United States]]. The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations; in most countries it started in 1929 and lasted until the late-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Garraty, ''The Great Depression'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Charles Duhigg, "Depression, You Say? Check Those Safety Nets", ''The New York Times'', March 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, the Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how intensely the world's economy can decline.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Eichengreen, ''Hall of Mirrors: The Great Depression, The Great Recession, and the Uses-and Misuses-of History'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression started in the United States after a major fall in stock prices that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the [[stock market crash]] of October 29, 1929 (known as [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday]]). Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide [[Gross domestic product|gross domestic product (GDP)]] fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lowenstein, "History Repeating," [https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-hall-of-mirrors-by-barry-eichengreen-1421192283 ''Wall Street Journal'' Jan 14, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Garraty, ''Great Depression'' (1986) ch1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries both [[developed country|rich]] and [[developing country|poor]]. [[Personal income]], tax revenue, profits and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25% and in some countries rose as high as 33%.&lt;ref name="Frank_Bernanke"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frank|first1=Robert H.|last2=Bernanke|first2=Ben S.|title= Principles of Macroeconomics|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|year=2007|edition=3rd|page=98|isbn= 0-07-319397-6|volume=|url=|accessdate=|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cities in the Great Depression|Cities around the world were hit]] hard, especially those dependent on [[heavy industry]]. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by about 60%.&lt;ref name="USBLS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/data/|title= Commodity Data|publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cochrane, Willard W.|authorlink=Willard Cochrane |title=Farm Prices, Myth and Reality|year=1958|page=15|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[League of Nations]]|title=World Economic Survey 1932–33| page=43|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing plummeting demand with few alternative sources of jobs, areas dependent on [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector industries]] such as mining and logging suffered the most.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, ''Depression Decade''&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic historians usually attribute the start of the Great Depression to the sudden devastating collapse of U.S. stock market prices on October 29, 1929, known as [[Black Tuesday]]. However,&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/243118/Great-Depression Great Depression], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; some dispute this conclusion and see the stock crash as a symptom, rather than a cause, of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="Frank_Bernanke"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Economics focus: The Great Depression|publisher=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 optimism persisted for some time. [[John D. Rockefeller]] said "These are days when many are discouraged. In the 93 years of my life, depressions have come and gone. Prosperity has always returned and will again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/lectures/lecture18.html |title=Crashing Hopes: The Great Depression |accessdate=2008-03-13 |last=Schultz |first=Stanley K. |year=1999 |work=American History 102: Civil War to the Present |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323120342/http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/lectures/lecture18.html |archivedate=2008-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stock market turned upward in early 1930, returning to early 1929 levels by April. This was still almost 30% below the peak of September 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-22 |url=http://www.gold-eagle.com/editorials_98/vronsky060698.html |title=1998/99 Prognosis Based Upon 1929 Market Autopsy |publisher=Gold Eagle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075810/http://www.gold-eagle.com/editorials_98/vronsky060698.html |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, government and business spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the corresponding period of the previous year. On the other hand, consumers, many of whom had suffered severe losses in the stock market the previous year, cut back their expenditures by 10%. In addition, beginning in the mid-1930s, a [[Dust Bowl|severe drought]] ravaged the agricultural heartland of the U.S.&lt;ref name=drought&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-1930, interest rates had dropped to low levels, but expected [[deflation]] and the continuing reluctance of people to borrow meant that consumer spending and investment were depressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James|last=Hamilton|title=Monetary Factors in the Great Depression|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145–169|year=1987|doi= 10.1016/0304-3932(87)90045-6|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1930, automobile sales had declined to below the levels of 1928. Prices in general began to decline, although wages held steady in 1930. Then a [[deflationary spiral]] started in 1931. Farmers faced a worse outlook; declining crop prices and a Great Plains drought crippled their economic outlook. At its peak, the Great Depression saw nearly 10% of all Great Plains farms change hands despite federal assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drought.unl.edu/DroughtBasics/DustBowl/TheGreatDepression.aspx|title=The Great Depression|website=drought.unl.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in the [[Economy of the United States|U.S. economy]] was the factor that pulled down most other countries at first; then, internal weaknesses or strengths in each country made conditions worse or better. Frantic attempts to shore up the economies of individual nations through [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies, such as the 1930 U.S. [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] and retaliatory tariffs in other countries, exacerbated the collapse in global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richard|first1=Clay Hanes (editor)|title=Historic Events for Students: The Great Depression|date=July 2002|publisher=Gale|isbn=978-0787657017|edition=Volume I}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1933, the economic decline had pushed world trade to one-third of its level just four years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/854609153|title=Worlds together, worlds apart : a history of the world from the beginnings of humankind to the present|last=L.|first=Tignor, Robert|isbn=9780393922073|edition=Fourth|location=New York|oclc=854609153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two classical competing theories of the Great Depression are the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] (demand-driven) and the [[Monetarism|monetarist]] explanation. There are also various [[Heterodox economics|heterodox theories]] that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists. The consensus among demand-driven theories is that a large-scale loss of confidence led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending. Once panic and deflation set in, many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets. Holding money became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods, exacerbating the drop in demand. Monetarists believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but the shrinking of the money supply greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression.

Economists and economic historians are almost evenly split as to whether the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right, or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending, particularly investment, is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="in JSTOR"&gt;Robert Whaples, ''Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions.'', ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 55, No. 1 (March 1995), p. 150 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123771 in JSTOR], or [http://www.employees.csbsju.edu/jolson/ECON315/Whaples2123771.pdf as PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Today the controversy is of lesser importance since there is mainstream support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that building on the monetary explanation of [[Milton Friedman]] and Anna Schwartz add non-monetary explanations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

There is consensus that the [[Federal Reserve System]] should have cut short the process of monetary deflation and banking collapse. If they had done this, the economic downturn would have been far less severe and much shorter.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, ''Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions.'', ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 55, No. 1 (March 1995), p. 143 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123771 in JSTOR], or [http://www.employees.csbsju.edu/jolson/ECON315/Whaples2123771.pdf as PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream explanations===

====Keynesian====
British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] argued in ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' that lower [[aggregate expenditure]]s in the economy contributed to a massive decline in income and to employment that was well below the average. In such a situation, the economy reached equilibrium at low levels of economic activity and high unemployment.

Keynes' basic idea was simple: to keep people fully employed, governments have to run deficits when the economy is slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep production at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession. Keynesian economists called on governments during times of [[Crisis (economic)|economic crisis]] to pick up the slack by increasing [[government spending]] and/or cutting taxes.

As the Depression wore on, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] tried [[public works]], [[Agricultural subsidy|farm subsidies]], and other devices to restart the U.S. economy, but never completely gave up trying to balance the budget. According to the Keynesians, this improved the economy, but Roosevelt never spent enough to bring the economy out of recession until the start of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| authorlink=Lawrence Klein|first=Lawrence R.|last=Klein|title=The Keynesian Revolution|year=1947| pages=56–58, 169, 177–79|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}; {{Cite book|first=Theodore|last=Rosenof|title=Economics in the Long Run: New Deal Theorists and Their Legacies, 1933–1993|year=1997|location=Chapel Hill|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0-8078-2315-5|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monetarist====

[[File:American union bank.gif|thumb|Crowd at New York's American Union Bank during a [[bank run]] early in the Great Depression]]

Monetarists follow the explanation given by [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna J. Schwartz]]. They argued that the Great Depression was caused by the banking crisis that caused one-third of all banks to vanish, a reduction of bank shareholder wealth and more importantly [[Contractionary monetary policy|monetary contraction]] of 35%, which they called "The [[Great Contraction]]." This caused a price drop of 33% ([[deflation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Randall E. Parker (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-g4AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA11#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Pin%20the%20blame%20squarely%20on%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%22 ''Reflections on the Great Depression''], Edward Elgar Publishing, {{ISBN|9781843765509}}, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; By not lowering interest rates, by not increasing the monetary base and by not injecting liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling, the Federal Reserve passively watched the transformation of a normal recession into the Great Depression. Friedman and Schwartz argued that the downward turn in the economy, starting with the stock market crash, would merely have been an ordinary recession if the Federal Reserve had taken aggressive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933 (New Edition)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&amp;q=%22Regarding%20the%20Great%20Depression%20You're%20right%20We%20did%20it%22|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Bernanke|year=2000|title=Essays on the Great Depression|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=c2OSWhLjzJkC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;vq=Schwartz&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22poor%20policy-making%22|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=7|isbn=0-691-01698-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was endorsed by [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Fed Governor]] [[Ben Bernanke]] in a speech honoring Friedman and Schwartz with this statement:

{{cquote|Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.&lt;ref&gt;Ben S. Bernanke (8 Nov 2002), [http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021108/default.htm FederalReserve.gov: Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke] Conference to Honor Milton Friedman, University of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FriedmanSchwartz&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933 (New Edition)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&amp;q=%22Regarding%20the%20Great%20Depression%20You're%20right%20We%20did%20it%22|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; — Ben S. Bernanke}}

The Federal Reserve allowed some large public bank failures – particularly that of the [[New York Bank of United States]] – which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks, and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that, if the Fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks, or simply bought [[government bond]]s on the [[open market]] to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell, all the rest of the banks would not have fallen after the large ones did, and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-22 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19857 |title=Who Was Milton Friedman? |website=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date= 15 Feb 2007|author=Paul Krugman|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410200144/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19857 |archivedate=April 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With significantly less money to go around, businesses could not get new loans and could not even get their old loans renewed, forcing many to stop investing. This interpretation blames the Federal Reserve for inaction, especially the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|New York branch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. Edward Griffin|title=The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve|url=https://ia601603.us.archive.org/28/items/TheCreatureFromJekyllIslandByG.EdwardGriffin/The-Creature-from-Jekyll-Island-by-G.-Edward-Griffin_text.pdf|year=1998|edition=3d|page=503|isbn= 978-0-912986-39-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason why the Federal Reserve did not act to limit the decline of the money supply was the [[gold standard]]. At that time, the amount of credit the Federal Reserve could issue was limited by the [[Federal Reserve Act]], which required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued. By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession. This credit was in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes.&lt;ref name="text"&gt;Frank Freidel (1973), [https://archive.org/details/franklindrooseve04fran ''Franklin D. Roosevelt: Launching the New Deal''], ch. 19, Little, Brown &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; A "promise of gold" is not as good as "gold in the hand", particularly when they only had enough gold to cover 40% of the Federal Reserve Notes outstanding. During the bank panics a portion of those demand notes were redeemed for Federal Reserve gold. Since the Federal Reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit, any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a greater reduction in credit. On April 5, 1933, President Roosevelt signed [[Executive Order 6102]] making the private ownership of [[gold certificate]]s, coins and bullion illegal, reducing the pressure on Federal Reserve gold.&lt;ref name="text"/&gt;

====Common position====
From the point of view of today's mainstream schools of economic thought, government should strive to keep the interconnected macroeconomic aggregates [[money supply]] and/or [[aggregate demand]] on a stable growth path. When threatened by the forecast of a depression [[central bank]]s should pour liquidity into the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to keep the nominal money stock and total nominal demand from collapsing.&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. Bradford |last=De Long |title=‘Liquidation’ Cycles: Old Fashioned Real Business Cycle Theory and the Great Depression |work=NBER Working Paper No. 3546 |date=December 1990 |page=1 |doi=10.3386/w3546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the Great Depression most economists believed in [[Say's law]] and the self-equilibrating powers of the market and failed to explain the severity of the Depression. Outright leave-it-alone [[Liquidationism (economics)|liquidationism]] was a position mainly held by the Austrian School.&lt;ref name="Randall E. Parker 2003, p. 9"/&gt; The liquidationist position was that a depression is good medicine. The idea was the benefit of a depression was to liquidate failed investments and businesses that have been made obsolete by technological development in order to release factors of production (capital and labor) from unproductive uses so that these could be redeployed in other sectors of the technologically dynamic economy. They argued that even if self-adjustment of the economy took mass bankruptcies, then so be it.&lt;ref name="Randall E. Parker 2003, p. 9" /&gt; An increasingly common view among economic historians is that the adherence of some Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist thesis led to disastrous consequences.&lt;ref name="WhiteLawrence" /&gt; Regarding the policies of [[Herbert Hoover|President Hoover]], economists like [[Barry Eichengreen]] and [[J. Bradford DeLong]] point out that President Hoover tried to keep the federal budget balanced until 1932, when he lost confidence in his Secretary of the Treasury [[Andrew Mellon]] and replaced him.&lt;ref name="Randall E. Parker 2003, p. 9"&gt;Randall E.

According to a study by [[Olivier Blanchard]] and [[Lawrence Summers]], the recession caused a drop of net [[capital accumulation]] to pre-1924 levels by 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. Bradford |last=De Long |title=‘Liquidation’ Cycles: Old Fashioned Real Business Cycle Theory and the Great Depression |work=NBER Working Paper No. 3546 |date=December 1990 |page=33 |doi=10.3386/w3546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Milton Friedman called the leave-it-alone liquidationism "dangerous nonsense".&lt;ref name="nber.org" /&gt; He wrote:
{{cquote|I think the Austrian business-cycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm. If you go back to the 1930s, which is a key point, here you had the Austrians sitting in London, Hayek and Lionel Robbins, and saying you just have to let the bottom drop out of the world. You've just got to let it cure itself. You can't do anything about it. You will only make it worse. ... I think by encouraging that kind of do-nothing policy both in Britain and in the United States, they did harm.&lt;ref name="WhiteLawrence" /&gt;}}

====Modern non-monetary explanations====
The monetary explanation has two weaknesses. First it is not able to explain why the demand for money was falling more rapidly than the supply during the initial downturn in 1930–31.&lt;ref name="in JSTOR"/&gt; Second it is not able to explain why in March 1933 a recovery took place although short term interest rates remained close to zero and the Money supply was still falling. These questions are addressed by modern explanations that build on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz but add non-monetary explanations.

=====Debt deflation=====

[[Irving Fisher]] argued that the predominant factor leading to the Great Depression was a vicious circle of deflation and growing over-indebtedness.&lt;ref name="Fisher33"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Irving|date= October 1933|title=The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions|journal=Econometrica|volume=1| pages=337–357|doi=10.2307/1907327|issue=4|publisher=The Econometric Society|ref=harv|jstor=1907327}}&lt;/ref&gt; He outlined nine factors interacting with one another under conditions of debt and deflation to create the mechanics of boom to bust. The chain of events proceeded as follows:
# Debt liquidation and distress selling
# Contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off
# A fall in the level of asset prices
# A still greater fall in the net worth of businesses, precipitating bankruptcies
# A fall in profits
# A reduction in output, in trade and in employment
# [[Pessimism]] and loss of confidence
# Hoarding of money
# A fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation adjusted interest rates&lt;ref name="Fisher33"/&gt;

During the Crash of 1929 preceding the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%.&lt;ref name="Margin Requirements"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fortune|first=Peter|date=Sep–Oct 2000|title= Margin Requirements, Margin Loans, and Margin Rates: Practice and Principles – analysis of history of margin credit regulations – Statistical Data Included|journal=New England Economic Review|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3937/is_2000_Sept-Oct/ai_80855422/pg_5|archive-url= https://archive.is/20120527091755/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3937/is_2000_Sept-Oct/ai_80855422/pg_5|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2012-05-27|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited.

Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets.&lt;ref name="lhf-30s"/&gt;

Outstanding debts became heavier, because prices and incomes fell by 20–50% but the debts remained at the same dollar amount. After the panic of 1929, and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 U.S. banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s). By April 1933, around $7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the [[Emergency Banking Act|March Bank Holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;"Friedman and Schwartz, Monetary History of the United States", 352&lt;/ref&gt; Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans which the borrowers did not have time or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, [[Investment|capital investment]] and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending.&lt;ref name="lhf-30s"/&gt; Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious cycle]] developed and the downward spiral accelerated.

The liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices which it caused. The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed, relative to the value of declining asset holdings. The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, the more they owed.&lt;ref name="Fisher33"/&gt; This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression.

Fisher's debt-deflation theory initially lacked mainstream influence because of the counter-argument that debt-deflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group (debtors) to another (creditors). Pure re-distributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects.

Building on both the monetary hypothesis of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]] as well as the debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, [[Ben Bernanke]] developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently leads to lowered [[aggregate demand]], a further decline in the price level then results in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions, that in turn leads to a [[credit crunch]] which does serious harm to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption and results in declining aggregate demand which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.&lt;ref&gt;Randall E.

=====Expectations hypothesis=====
Since economic mainstream turned to the [[new neoclassical synthesis]], expectations are a central element of macroeconomic models. According to [[Peter Temin]], Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and [[Christina Romer]], the key to recovery and to ending the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive in March 1933 when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, and investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turn around. Money supply was still falling and short term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933 people expected further deflation and a recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With these positive expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free fall in 1933, and output would have been 30% lower in 1937 than in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Gauti B. Eggertsson, [http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.98.4.1476 ''Great Expectations and the End of the Depression''], American Economic Review 2008, 98:4, 1476–1516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christina Romer, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/business/how-the-fiscal-stimulus-helped-and-could-have-done-more.html "The Fiscal Stimulus, Flawed but Valuable"], ''The New York Times'', October 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Temin, ''Lessons from the Great Depression'', MIT Press, 1992, {{ISBN|9780262261197}}, pp. 87–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[recession of 1937–38]], which slowed down economic recovery from the Great Depression, is explained by fears of the population that the moderate tightening of the monetary and fiscal policy in 1937 would be first steps to a restoration of the pre-March 1933 policy regime.&lt;ref&gt;Gauti B. Eggertsson, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/29730131 Great Expectations and the End of the Depression], The American Economic Review, Vol. 98, No. 4 (Sep., 2008), S. 1476–1516, p. 1480&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterodox theories===

====Austrian School====
Two prominent theorists in the [[Austrian School]] on the Great Depression include Austrian economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] and American economist [[Murray Rothbard]], who wrote ''[[America's Great Depression]]'' (1963). In their view, much like the monetarists, the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] (of which was created in 1913) shoulders much of the blame; however unlike the [[Monetarism|Monetarists]], they argue that the key cause of the Depression was the expansion of the [[money supply]] in the 1920s, of which led to an unsustainable credit-driven boom.&lt;ref name="America's Great Depression, pp. 159-163"&gt;Murray Rothbard, ''America's Great Depression'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2000), pp. 159–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Austrian view it was this inflation of the money supply that led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices (stocks and bonds) and [[capital goods]]. Therefore, by the time the Federal Reserve tightened in 1928 it was far too late to prevent an economic contraction.&lt;ref name="America's Great Depression, pp. 159-163" /&gt; In February 1929 [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] published a paper predicting the Federal Reserve's actions would lead to a crisis starting in the [[Stock market|stock]] and [[Credit market|credit]] markets.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur, ''The Cave and the Light: Plato versus Aristotle, and the Struggle for the Soul of Western Civilization'', p. 548 (Kindle location 10208).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rothbard, the government support for failed enterprises and efforts to keep wages above their market values actually prolonged the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, ''America's Great Depression'', pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]], after 1970 [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] believed that the Federal Reserve had further contributed to the problems of the Depression by permitting the money supply to shrink during the earliest years of the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;For Hayek's view, see Diego Pizano, ''Conversations with Great Economists: Friedrich A. Hayek, John Hicks, Nicholas Kaldor, Leonid V. Kantorovich, Joan Robinson, Paul A.Samuelson, Jan Tinbergen'' (Jorge Pinto Books, 2009). For Rothbard's view, see Murray Rothbard, ''A History of Money and Banking in the United States'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute), pp. 293–294.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the Depression (in 1932&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and in 1934)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hayek had criticized both the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] and the [[Bank of England]] for not taking a more contractionary stance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[John Cunningham Wood]], Robert D. Wood, ''Friedrich A. Hayek'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004, {{ISBN|9780415310574}}, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Sennholz]], another prominent [[Austrian Economist|Austrian economist]], argued that most [[Austrian business cycle theory|boom and busts]] that plagued the American economy, such as those in [[Panic of 1819|1819–20]], [[Depression of 1837|1839–43]], [[Panic of 1857|1857–60]], [[Long Depression|1873–78]], [[Depression of 1893|1893–97]], and [[Depression of 1920–21|1920–21]], were generated by government creating a boom through easy money and credit, which was soon followed by the inevitable bust. The spectacular crash of 1929 followed five years of reckless credit expansion by the Federal Reserve System under the [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge Administration]]. The passing of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], the passage of [[The Federal Reserve Act]], rising government deficits, the passage of the [[Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act]], and the [[Revenue Act of 1932]], exacerbated and prolonged the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fee.org/articles/the-great-depression/|title=The Great Depression|accessdate=October 23, 2016|work=[[Foundation for Economic Education]]|first=Hans|last=Sennholz|date=October 1, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig von Mises]] wrote in the 1930s: "Credit expansion cannot increase the supply of real goods. It merely brings about a rearrangement. It diverts capital investment away from the course prescribed by the state of economic wealth and market conditions. It causes production to pursue paths which it would not follow unless the economy were to acquire an increase in material goods. As a result, the upswing lacks a solid base. It is not a real prosperity. It is illusory prosperity. It did not develop from an increase in economic wealth, i.e. the accumulation of savings made available for productive investment. Rather, it arose because the credit expansion created the illusion of such an increase. Sooner or later, it must become apparent that this economic situation is built on sand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/causes-economic-crisis-and-other-essays-and-after-great-depression|title=The Causes of the Economic Crisis, and Other Essays Before and After the Great Depression|accessdate=October 24, 2016|work=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|first=Ludwig|last=Mises}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/buying-bad-debt-to-return-bank-solvency-2011-2?op=1|title=Buying Bad Debt to Return Bank Solvency|accessdate=October 24, 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|first=Bill|last=Bonner|date=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inequality====
[[File:Tenantless farm Texas panhandle 1938.jpg|thumb|[[Mechanised agriculture|Power farming]] displaces tenants from the land in the western dry cotton area. [[Childress County, Texas]], 1938]]

Two economists of the 1920s, [[Waddill Catchings]] and [[William Trufant Foster]], popularized a theory that influenced many policy makers, including Herbert Hoover, [[Henry A. Wallace]], [[Paul Douglas]], and [[Marriner Eccles]]. It held the economy produced more than it consumed, because the consumers did not have enough income. Thus the unequal [[distribution of wealth]] throughout the 1920s caused the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Dorfman 1959&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgoewer"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Allgoewer|first=Elisabeth|date=May 2002|title= Underconsumption theories and Keynesian economics. Interpretations of the Great Depression|journal=Discussion paper no. 2002–14|url= http://www.vwa.unisg.ch/RePEc/usg/dp2002/dp0214allgoewer_ganz.pdf|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, the [[root cause]] of the Great Depression was a global over-investment in heavy industry capacity compared to wages and earnings from independent businesses, such as farms. The proposed solution was for the government to pump money into the consumers' pockets. That is, it must redistribute purchasing power, maintaining the industrial base, and re-inflating prices and wages to force as much of the inflationary increase in purchasing power into [[consumer spending]]. The economy was overbuilt, and new factories were not needed. Foster and Catchings recommended&lt;ref&gt;''The Road to Plenty'' (1928)&lt;/ref&gt; federal and state governments to start large construction projects, a program followed by Hoover and Roosevelt.

====Productivity shock====
{{quote|It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the [productivity, output and employment] trends we are describing are long-time trends and were thoroughly evident prior to 1929. These trends are in nowise the result of the present depression, nor are they the result of the World War.

King Hubbert]]}}

The first three decades of the 20th century saw economic output surge with [[electrification]], [[mass production]] and motorized farm machinery, and because of the rapid growth in productivity there was a lot of excess production capacity and the work week was being reduced.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The dramatic rise in [[productivity]] of major industries in the U.S. and the effects of productivity on output, wages and the work week are discussed by Spurgeon Bell in his book ''Productivity, Wages, and National Income'' (1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Worsening of global depression==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
The gold standard was the primary transmission mechanism of the Great Depression. Even countries that did not face bank failures and a monetary contraction first hand were forced to join the deflationary policy since higher interest rates in countries that performed a deflationary policy led to a gold outflow in countries with lower interest rates. Under the gold standard's [[price–specie flow mechanism]], countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline ([[deflation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Temin, Gianni Toniolo, ''The World Economy between the Wars'', Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|9780198042013}}, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randall E. Parker, ''Reflections on the Great Depression'', Elgar publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-84376-335-2}}, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also consensus that protectionist policies such as the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] helped to worsen the depression.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples: ''Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions.'' In: ''Journal of Economic History.'' Band 55, Nr. 1 (März 1995), S. 139–154, hier S. 151 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123771 in JSTOR.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold standard===
[[File:Graph charting income per capita throughout the Great Depression.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The Depression in international perspective&lt;ref&gt;International data from {{cite web|first=Angus |last=Maddison |authorlink=Angus Maddison |title=Historical Statistics for the World Economy: 1–2003 AD |url=http://www.ggdc.net/Maddison/Historical_Statistics/ |ref=harv |postscript= }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

Some economic studies have indicated that just as the downturn was spread worldwide by the rigidities of the [[Gold Standard]], it was suspending gold convertibility (or devaluing the currency in gold terms) that did the most to make recovery possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919–1939|authorlink=Barry Eichengreen |first=Barry|last=Eichengreen|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1992|isbn= 0-19-506431-3|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every major currency left the gold standard during the Great Depression. The UK was the first to do so. Facing [[speculative attack]]s on the [[Pound sterling|pound]] and depleting [[Official gold reserves|gold reserves]], in September 1931 the [[Bank of England]] ceased exchanging pound notes for gold and the pound was floated on foreign exchange markets.

The UK, Japan, and the Scandinavian countries left the gold standard in 1931. Other countries, such as Italy and the U.S., remained on the gold standard into 1932 or 1933, while a few countries in the so-called "gold bloc", led by France and including Poland, Belgium and Switzerland, stayed on the standard until 1935–36.

According to later analysis, the earliness with which a country left the gold standard reliably predicted its economic recovery. For example, The UK and Scandinavia, which left the gold standard in 1931, recovered much earlier than France and Belgium, which remained on gold much longer. Countries such as China, which had a [[silver standard]], almost avoided the depression entirely. The connection between leaving the gold standard as a strong predictor of that country's severity of its depression and the length of time of its recovery has been shown to be consistent for dozens of countries, including [[Developing country|developing countries]]. This partly explains why the experience and length of the depression differed between national economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernanke|first=Ben|date=March 2, 2004|title=Remarks by Governor Ben S.

===Breakdown of international trade===
Many economists have argued that the sharp decline in international trade after 1930 helped to worsen the depression, especially for countries significantly dependent on foreign trade. In a 1995 survey of American economic historians, two-thirds agreed that the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] at least worsened the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, "Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions", ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 55, No. 1 (Mar., 1995), pp. 139–54 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123771 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians and economists partly blame the American Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act (enacted June 17, 1930) for worsening the depression by seriously reducing international trade and causing retaliatory tariffs in other countries. While foreign trade was a small part of overall economic activity in the U.S. and was concentrated in a few businesses like farming, it was a much larger factor in many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-22 |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/depress.htm |title=The World in Depression |publisher=[[Mount Holyoke College]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310145946/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/depress.htm |archivedate=March 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average ''[[ad valorem]]'' rate of duties on dutiable imports for 1921–25 was 25.9% but under the new tariff it jumped to 50% during 1931–35. In dollar terms, American exports declined over the next four (4) years from about $5.2 billion in 1929 to $1.7 billion in 1933; so, not only did the physical volume of exports fall, but also the prices fell by about 1/3 as written. Hardest hit were farm commodities such as wheat, cotton, tobacco, and lumber.

Governments around the world took various steps into spending less money on foreign goods such as: "imposing tariffs, import quotas, and exchange controls". These restrictions formed a lot of tension between trade nations, causing a major deduction during the depression. Not all countries enforced the same measures of protectionism. Some countries raised tariffs drastically and enforced severe restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, while other countries condensed "trade and exchange restrictions only marginally":&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"&gt;EICHENGREEN, B., &amp; IRWIN, D. A. (2010). The Slide to Protectionism in the Great Depression: Who Succumbed and Why?. Journal of Economic History, 70(4), 871–97.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Countries that remained on the gold standard, keeping currencies fixed, were more likely to restrict foreign trade." These countries "resorted to protectionist policies to strengthen the [[balance of payments]] and limit gold losses." They hoped that these restrictions and depletions would hold the economic decline.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"/&gt;
*Countries that abandoned the gold standard, allowed their currencies to [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|depreciate]] which caused their balance of payments to strengthen. It also freed up monetary policy so that central banks could lower interest rates and act as lenders of last resort. They possessed the best policy instruments to fight the Depression and did not need protectionism.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"/&gt;
*"The length and depth of a country’s economic downturn and the timing and vigor of its recovery is related to how long it remained on the [[gold standard]]. Countries abandoning the gold standard relatively early experienced relatively mild recessions and early recoveries. In contrast, countries remaining on the gold standard experienced prolonged slumps."&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"/&gt;

====Effect of tariffs====
{{See also|Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act}}
The consensus view among economists and economic historians is that the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff exacerbated the Great Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whaples|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Whaples|journal=[[The Journal of Economic History]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=144|jstor=2123771|title=Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians?

In the popular view, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff was a leading cause of the depression.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/protectionism-and-the-great-depression/ Protectionism and the Great Depression],'' [[Paul Krugman]], ''[[New York Times]],'' November 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eichenirwin"&gt;''[http://voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/3280 The protectionist temptation: Lessons from the Great Depression for today],'' VOX, Barry Eichengreen, Douglas Irwin, 17 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, many economists hold the opinion that the tariff act did not greatly worsen the depression.

===German banking crisis of 1931 and British crisis===
{{Split section|European banking crisis of 1931|date=September 2017}}
The financial crisis escalated out of control in mid-1931, starting with the collapse of the [[Creditanstalt|Credit Anstalt]] in Vienna in May.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain between the wars, 1918–1940'' (1955) pp 379–385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William Ashworth 1962 pp 237-244"&gt;William Ashworth, ''A short history of the international economy since 1850'' (2nd ed 1962) pp 237–244.&lt;/ref&gt; This put heavy pressure on Germany, which was already in political turmoil. With the rise in violence of Nazi and communist movements, as well as investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies.&lt;ref name="Isabel Schnabel 1931"&gt;Isabel Schnabel, "The German twin crisis of 1931." ''Journal of Economic History'' 64#3 (2004): 822–871.&lt;/ref&gt; Investors withdrew their short-term money from Germany, as confidence spiraled downward. The Reichsbank lost 150 million marks in the first week of June, 540 million in the second, and 150 million in two days, June 19–20. Collapse was at hand. U.S. President Herbert Hoover called for a [[Hoover Moratorium|moratorium on Payment of war reparations]]. This angered Paris, which depended on a steady flow of German payments, but it slowed the crisis down and the moratorium, was agreed to in July 1931. International conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on August 19 a standstill agreement froze Germany's foreign liabilities for six months. Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England. The funding only slowed the process; it's nothing. Industrial failures began in Germany, a major bank closed in July and a two-day holiday for all German banks was declared. Business failures more frequent in July, and spread to Romania and Hungary. The crisis continued to get worse in Germany, bringing political upheaval that finally led to the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|coming to power of Hitler's Nazi regime]] in January 1933.&lt;ref name="V. Hodson, 1938 pp. 64-76"&gt;H. V. Hodson, ''Slump and Recovery, 1929–1937'' (London, 1938), pp. 64–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The world financial crisis now began to overwhelm Britain; investors across the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of £2.5 million per day.&lt;ref name="David Williams 1963"&gt;David Williams, "London and the 1931 financial crisis." ''Economic History Review'' 15.3 (1963): 513–528.&lt;/ref&gt; Credits of £25 millions each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of £15 millions fiduciary note slowed, but did not reverse the British crisis. The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931. With deficits mounting, the bankers demanded a balanced budget; the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government agreed; it proposed to raise taxes, cut spending and most controversially, to cut unemployment benefits 20%. The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement. MacDonald wanted to resign, but King George V insisted he remain and form an all-party coalition "[[National Government (United Kingdom)|National government]]." The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on, along with a small cadre of Labour, but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government. Britain went off the [[gold standard]], and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression. In the 1931 British election the Labour Party was virtually destroyed, leaving MacDonald as Prime Minister for a largely Conservative coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Mowat, ''Britain between the wars, 1918–1940'' (1955) pp 386–412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Oxborrow 1976 pp 67-73"&gt;Sean Glynn and John Oxborrow, ''Interwar Britain : a social and economic history'' (1976) pp 67–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turning point and recovery==

In most countries of the world, recovery from the Great Depression began in 1933.&lt;ref name= Britannica/&gt; In the U.S., recovery began in early 1933,&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; but the U.S. did not return to 1929 GNP for over a decade and still had an unemployment rate of about 15% in 1940, albeit down from the high of 25% in 1933.

There is no consensus among economists regarding the motive force for the U.S. economic expansion that continued through most of the Roosevelt years (and the 1937 recession that interrupted it). The common view among most economists is that Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] policies either caused or accelerated the recovery, although his policies were never aggressive enough to bring the economy completely out of recession. Some economists have also called attention to the positive effects from expectations of [[reflation]] and rising nominal interest rates that Roosevelt's words and actions portended.&lt;ref&gt;Gauti B.

According to [[Christina Romer]], the money supply growth caused by huge international gold inflows was a crucial source of the recovery of the United States economy, and that the economy showed little sign of self-correction. The gold inflows were partly due to [[Executive Order 6102|devaluation of the U.S. dollar]] and partly due to deterioration of the political situation in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romer|first=Christina D.|date=December 1992|title=What Ended the Great Depression|url=http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~cromer/What%20Ended%20the%20Great%20Depression.pdf|dead-url=yes|journal=Journal of Economic History|volume=52|issue=4|pages=757–784|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117093624/http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~cromer/What%20Ended%20the%20Great%20Depression.pdf|archive-date=January 17, 2013|quote=monetary development were crucial to the recovery implies that self-correction played little role in the growth of real output|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book, ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna J.

===Role of women and household economics===
Women's primary role were as housewives; without a steady flow of family income, their work became much harder in dealing with food and clothing and medical care. Birthrates fell everywhere, as children were postponed until families could financially support them. The average birthrate for 14 major countries fell 12% from 19.3 births per thousand population in 1930, to 17.0 in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Woytinsky and E.S.

Among the few women in the labor force, layoffs were less common in the white-collar jobs and they were typically found in light manufacturing work. However, there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job, so that wives might lose employment if their husband was employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jill Stephenson|title=Women in Nazi Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-rqOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|year=2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=3–5|isbn=9781317876076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan K.

Bean, "'To help keep the home going': female labour supply in interwar London." ''Economic History Review'' (2015) 68#2 pp 441–470.&lt;/ref&gt;

In rural and small-town areas, women expanded their operation of vegetable gardens to include as much food production as possible. In the United States, agricultural organizations sponsored programs to teach housewives how to optimize their gardens and to raise poultry for meat and eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Ann E. McCleary, "'I Was Really Proud of Them': Canned Raspberries and Home Production During the Farm Depression." ''Augusta Historical Bulletin'' (2010), Issue 46, pp 14–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In American cities, African American women quiltmakers enlarged their activities, promoted collaboration, and trained neophytes. Quilts were created for practical use from various inexpensive materials and increased social interaction for women and promoted camaraderie and personal fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;Tari Klassen, "How Depression-Era Quiltmakers Constructed Domestic Space: An Interracial Processual Study," ''Midwestern Folklore: Journal of the Hoosier Folklore Society'' (2008) 34#2  pp 17–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral history provides evidence for how housewives in a modern industrial city handled shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the [[Sunday roast]] into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws.&lt;ref&gt;Baillargeon, ''Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression'' (1999), pp. 70, 108, 136–38, 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, official government policy was deflationary and the opposite of Keynesian spending. Consequently, the government launched a nationwide campaign to induce households to reduce their consumption, focusing attention on spending by housewives.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Metzler, "Woman's Place in Japan's Great Depression: Reflections on the Moral Economy of Deflation." ''Journal of Japanese Studies'' (2004) 30#2 pp 315–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the government tried to reshape private household consumption under the Four-Year Plan of 1936 to achieve German economic self-sufficiency. The Nazi women's organizations, other propaganda agencies and the authorities all attempted to shape such consumption as economic self-sufficiency was needed to prepare for and to sustain the coming war. The organizations, propaganda agencies and authorities employed slogans that called up traditional values of thrift and healthy living. However, these efforts were only partly successful in changing the behavior of housewives.&lt;ref&gt;N. R. Reagin, "Marktordnung and Autarkic Housekeeping: Housewives and Private Consumption under the Four-Year Plan, 1936–1939," ''German History'' (2001) 19#2 pp 162–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II and recovery===
[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|A female factory worker in 1942, [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. Women entered the workforce as men were drafted into the armed forces.]]
The common view among economic historians is that the Great Depression ended with the advent of World War II. Many economists believe that government spending on the war caused or at least accelerated recovery from the Great Depression, though some consider that it did not play a very large role in the recovery. It did help in reducing unemployment.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref name="Galbraith"&gt;Referring to the effect of World War II spending on the economy, economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] said, "One could not have had a better demonstration of the Keynesian ideas." {{cite video|people=[[Daniel Yergin]], William Cran (writers / producer)|url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/lo/story/ch_menu.html|title= Commanding Heights, see chapter 6 video or transcript|medium=TV documentary|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|location=U.S.|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romer|first=Christina D.|authorlink=Christina Romer|title=What Ended the Great Depression?|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1992|volume=52|issue=4|pages=757–784| doi=10.1017/S002205070001189X|quote=fiscal policy was of little consequence even as late as 1942, suggests an interesting twist on the usual view that World War II caused, or at least accelerated, the recovery from the Great Depression.|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgs|first=Robert|date=1992-03-01|title=Wartime Prosperity?

The rearmament policies leading up to World War II helped stimulate the economies of Europe in 1937–39. By 1937, unemployment in Britain had fallen to 1.5 million. The [[mobilization]] of manpower following the outbreak of war in 1939 ended unemployment.&lt;ref name="Great Depression and World War II"&gt;[http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/wwii/jb_wwii_subj.html Great Depression and World War II]. ''The Library of Congress''.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States entered into the war in 1941, it finally eliminated the last effects from the Great Depression and brought the U.S. unemployment rate down below 10%.&lt;ref name="Depression &amp; World War II"&gt;[http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/jb/wwii Depression &amp; WWII] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625204217/http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/jb/wwii |date=2009-06-25 }}. Americaslibrary.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., massive war spending doubled economic growth rates, either masking the effects of the Depression or essentially ending the Depression. Businessmen ignored the mounting [[national debt]] and heavy new taxes, redoubling their efforts for greater output to take advantage of generous government contracts.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The majority of countries set up relief programs and most underwent some sort of political upheaval, pushing them to the right. Many of the countries in Europe and Latin America that were democracies saw them overthrown by some form of dictatorship or authoritarian rule, [[Nazi Germany#Nazi seizure of power|most famously in Germany]] in 1933. [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador#Political collapse|The Dominion of Newfoundland]] gave up democracy voluntarily.

Australia's dependence on agricultural and industrial exports meant it was one of the hardest-hit developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Lawrence, ''Capitalism and the Countryside: The rural crisis in Australia'' (Pluto Press, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Falling export demand and commodity prices placed massive downward pressures on wages.

===Canada===

[[File:UnemployedMarch.jpg|thumb|upright|Unemployed men march in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.]]

Harshly affected by both the global economic downturn and the [[Dust Bowl]], Canadian industrial production had fallen to only 58% of the 1929 level by 1932, the second lowest level in the world after the United States, and well behind nations such as Britain, which fell to only 83% of the 1929 level. Total [[Measures of national income and output|national income]] fell to 56% of the 1929 level, again worse than any nation apart from the United States. Unemployment reached 27% at the depth of the Depression in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianeconomy.gc.ca/English/economy/1929_39depression.html 1929–1939 – The Great Depression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127051620/https://canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/1929_39depression.html |date=2009-01-27 }}, Source: Bank of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{Main|Great Depression in Chile}}
The [[League of Nations]] labeled [[Chile]] the country hardest hit by the Great Depression because 80% of government revenue came from exports of copper and nitrates, which were in low demand. Chile initially felt the impact of the Great Depression in 1930, when GDP dropped 14%, mining income declined 27%, and export earnings fell 28%. By 1932, GDP had shrunk to less than half of what it had been in 1929, exacting a terrible toll in unemployment and business failures.

Influenced profoundly by the Great Depression, many national leaders promoted the development of local industry in an effort to insulate the economy from future external shocks. After six years of government [[Austerity|austerity measures]], which succeeded in reestablishing Chile's creditworthiness, Chileans elected to office during the 1938–58 period a succession of center and left-of-center governments interested in promoting economic growth by means of government intervention.

Prompted in part by the devastating [[1939 Chillán earthquake]], the [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]] government of [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]] created the Production Development Corporation (Corporación de Fomento de la Producción, [[CORFO]]) to encourage with subsidies and direct investments an ambitious program of [[import substitution industrialization]]. Consequently, as in other Latin American countries, [[protectionism]] became an entrenched aspect of the Chilean economy.

===China===
{{Main|Nanjing Decade}}
China was largely unaffected by the Depression, mainly by having stuck to the [[Silver standard]]. However, the U.S. silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on China's silver coins, and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in 1935 in favor of the four Chinese national banks' "legal note" issues. China and the British colony of Hong Kong, which followed suit in this regard in September 1935, would be the last to abandon the silver standard. In addition, the [[Nationalist Government]] also acted energetically to modernize the legal and penal systems, stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in narcotics and augment industrial and agricultural production. On November 3, 1935, the government instituted the fiat currency (fapi) reform, immediately stabilizing prices and also raising revenues for the government.

===European African colonies===
The sharp fall in commodity prices, and the steep decline in exports, hurt the economies of the European colonies in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Latham and John Heaton, ''The Depression and the Developing World, 1914-1939'' (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch, "Mutation de l'impérialisme colonial français dans les années 30." ''African Economic History'' (1977): 103-152. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3601244 online in French]&lt;/ref&gt; The agricultural sector was especially hard hit. For example, [[sisal]] had recently become a major export crop in Kenya and Tanganyika. During the depression it suffered severely from low prices and marketing problems that affected all colonial commodities in Africa. Sisal producers established centralized controls for the export of their fibre.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Westcott, "The East African sisal industry, 1929–1949: the marketing of a colonial commodity during depression and war." ''Journal of African History'' 25.4 (1984): 445-461.&lt;/ref&gt; There was widespread unemployment and hardship among peasants, labourers, colonial auxiliaries, and artisans.&lt;ref&gt;R. Olufeni Ekundare, ''An Economic History of Nigeria 1860-1960'' (1973) [http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/economic-history-nigeria-1860-1960-r-olufeni-ekundare online] pp 104-226.&lt;/ref&gt;  The budgets of colonial governments were cut, which forced the reduction in ongoing infrastructure projects, such as the building and upgrading of roads, ports and communications.&lt;ref&gt;O.O. Olubomehin, "Road Transportation and the Economy of South-Western Nigeria, 1920-1939." ''Lagos Historical Review'' 2 (2002): 106-121.&lt;/ref&gt; The budget cuts delayed the schedule for creating systems of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Gatian F. Lungu, "Educational Policy-Making in Colonial Zambia: The Case of Higher Education for Africans from 1924 to 1964." The Journal of Negro History 78.4 (1993): 207-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depression severely hurt the export-based [[Belgian Congo]] economy because of the drop in international demand for raw materials and for agricultural products. For example, the price of peanuts fell from 125 to 25 centimes. In some areas, as in the [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] mining region, employment declined by 70%. In the country as a whole, the wage labour force decreased by 72.000 and many men returned to their villages. In Leopoldville, the population decreased by 33%, because of this labour migration.&lt;ref&gt;R. Anstey, ''King Leopold's Legacy: The Congo under Belgian Rule 1908–1960'' (1966), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political protests were not common. However, there was a growing demand that the paternalistic claims be honored by colonial governments to respond vigorously. The theme was that economic reforms were more urgently needed than political reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Ochonu, "Critical convergence: the Great Depression and the meshing of Nigerian and British anti-colonial polemic." ''Canadian Journal of African Studies/La Revue canadienne des études africaines'' 43.2 (2009): 245-281.&lt;/ref&gt; French West Africa launched an extensive program of educational reform centered around "rural schools" designed to modernize agriculture and stem the flow of under-employed farm workers to cites where unemployment was high. Students were trained in traditional arts, crafts, and farming techniques and were then expected to return to their own villages and towns.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gamble, "Les paysans de l'empire: écoles rurales et imaginaire colonial en Afrique occidentale française dans les années 1930. ''Cahiers d'Études Africaines'' (2009) 49#3 pp 775-803.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{Main|Great Depression in France}}
The crisis affected France a bit later than other countries, hitting hard around 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Laufenburger, "France and the Depression," ''International Affairs'' (1936) 15#2 pp. 202–224 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2601740 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; While the 1920s grew at the very strong rate of 4.43% per year, the 1930s rate fell to only 0.63%.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Dormois, ''The French Economy in the Twentieth Century'' (2004) p 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The depression was relatively mild: unemployment peaked under 5%, the fall in production was at most 20% below the 1929 output; there was no banking crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Beaudry and Franck Portier, "The French Depression in the 1930s," ''Review of Economic Dynamics'' (2002) 5:73–99 doi:10.1006/redy.2001.0143&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the depression had drastic effects on the local economy, and partly explains the [[February 6, 1934 riots]] and even more the formation of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], led by [[Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière|SFIO socialist leader]] [[Léon Blum]], which won the elections in 1936. Ultra-nationalist groups also saw increased popularity, although democracy prevailed into [[World War II]].

France's relatively high degree of self-sufficiency meant the damage was considerably less than in nations like Germany.

===Germany===
{{Main|Weimar Republic}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-11-19-12, Adolf Hitler bei Ortsgruppenfeier der NSDAP Rosenheim.jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] speaking in 1935]]
The Great Depression hit Germany hard. The impact of the [[Wall Street Crash]] forced American banks to end the new loans that had been funding the repayments under the [[Dawes Plan]] and the [[Young Plan]]. The financial crisis escalated out of control and mid-1931, starting with the collapse of the [[Credit Anstalt]] in Vienna in May.&lt;ref name="William Ashworth 1962 pp 237-244"/&gt; This put heavy pressure on Germany, which was already in political turmoil with the rise in violence of Nazi and communist movements, as well as with investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies.&lt;ref name="Isabel Schnabel 1931"/&gt; Investors withdrew their short-term money from Germany, as confidence spiraled downward. The Reichsbank lost 150 million marks in the first week of June, 540 million in the second, and 150 million in two days, June 19–20. Collapse was at hand. U.S. President Herbert Hoover called for a moratorium on Payment of war reparations. This angered Paris, which depended on a steady flow of German payments, but it slowed the crisis down and the moratorium, was agreed to in July 1931. An international conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on August 19 a standstill agreement froze Germany's foreign liabilities for six months. Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England. The funding only slowed the process. Industrial failures began in Germany, a major bank closed in July and a two-day holiday for all German banks was declared. Business failures became more frequent in July, and spread to Romania and Hungary.&lt;ref name="V. Hodson, 1938 pp. 64-76"/&gt;

In 1932, 90% of German reparation payments were cancelled. (In the 1950s, Germany repaid all its missed reparations debts.) Widespread unemployment reached 25% as every sector was hurt. The government did not increase government spending to deal with Germany's growing crisis, as they were afraid that a high-spending policy could lead to a return of the [[hyperinflation]] that had affected Germany in 1923. Germany's [[Weimar Republic]] was hit hard by the depression, as American loans to help rebuild the German economy now stopped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/depression/about.htm About the Great Depression], University of Illinois&lt;/ref&gt; The unemployment rate reached nearly 30% in 1932, bolstering support for the Nazi (NSDAP) and Communist (KPD) parties, causing the collapse of the politically centrist Social Democratic Party. Hitler ran for the Presidency in 1932, and while he lost to the incumbent Hindenburg in the election, it marked a point during which both Nazi Party and the Communist parties rose in the years following the crash to altogether possess a Reichstag majority following the [[German election, July 1932|general election in July 1932]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/lo/countries/de/de_economic.html Germany – Economic], Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/riseofhitler/runs.htm|title=The History Place – Rise of Hitler: Hitler Runs for President|website=www.historyplace.com|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler followed an [[autarky]] economic policy, creating a network of client states and economic allies in central Europe and Latin America. By cutting wages and taking control of labor unions, plus public works spending, unemployment fell significantly by 1935. Large-scale military spending played a major role in the recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Tooze]], ''The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
{{Main|Economic history of Greece and the Greek world}}
The reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932. The [[Bank of Greece]] tried to adopt deflationary policies to stave off the crises that were going on in other countries, but these largely failed. For a brief period the drachma was pegged to the U.S. dollar, but this was unsustainable given the country's large trade deficit and the only long-term effects of this were Greece's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932. Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April, 1931. This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK, France and the Middle East for many necessities. Greece went off the gold standard in April, 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments. The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas, which a number of European countries did during the time period.

Protectionist policies coupled with a weak drachma, stifling imports, allowed Greek industry to expand during the Great Depression. In 1939, Greek Industrial output was 179% that of 1928. These industries were for the most part "built on sand" as one report of the Bank of Greece put it, as without massive protection they would not have been able to survive. Despite the global depression, Greece managed to suffer comparatively little, averaging an average growth rate of 3.5% from 1932 to 1939. The dictatorial regime of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] took over the Greek government in 1936, and economic growth was strong in the years leading up to the Second World War.

===Iceland===
Icelandic post-World War I prosperity came to an end with the outbreak of the Great Depression. The Depression hit Iceland hard as the value of exports plummeted. The total value of Icelandic exports fell from 74 million kronur in 1929 to 48 million in 1932, and was not to rise again to the pre-1930 level until after 1939.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Iceland|last=Karlsson|first=Gunnar|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=308–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government interference in the economy increased: "Imports were regulated, trade with foreign currency was monopolized by state-owned banks, and loan capital was largely distributed by state-regulated funds".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Due to the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], which cut Iceland's exports of saltfish by half, the Depression lasted in Iceland until the outbreak of World War II (when prices for fish exports soared).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===India===
{{Main|Great Depression in India}}
How much India was affected has been hotly debated. Historians have argued that the Great Depression slowed long-term industrial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Colonial Economy in the Great Depression, Madras (1929&amp;ndash;1937)|first=K. A. |last=Manikumar|year=2003|ref=Manikumar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from two sectors—jute and coal—the economy was little affected. However, there were major negative impacts on the jute industry, as world demand fell and prices plunged.&lt;ref&gt;Samita Sen, "Labour, Organization and Gender: The Jute Industry in India in the 1930s," in Helmut Konrad and Wolfgang Maderthaner, eds. ''Routes Into the Abyss: Coping with Crises in the 1930s'' (2013) pp 152-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise conditions were fairly stable. Local markets in agriculture and small-scale industry showed modest gains.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Simmons, "The Great Depression and Indian Industry: Changing interpretations and changing perceptions."

===Ireland===
{{Main|Economic history of the Republic of Ireland}}
Frank Barry and [[Mary E. Daly]] have argued that:
:Ireland was a largely agrarian economy, trading almost exclusively with the UK, at the time of the Great Depression. Beef and dairy products comprised the bulk of exports, and Ireland fared well relative to many other commodity producers, particularly in the early years of the depression.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Barry and Mary F. Daly, "Concurrent Irish Perspectives on the Great Depression" (2010) [ online ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Barry and Mary E. Daly, "Irish Perceptions of the Great Depression" in Michael Psalidopoulos, ''The Great Depression in Europe: Economic Thought and Policy in a National Context'' (Athens: Alpha Bank, 2012) pp. 395–424.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also B.

===Italy===
{{Main|Economic history of Italy}}
The Great Depression hit [[Economy of Italy under fascism#The Great Depression|Italy]] very hard.&lt;ref&gt;Vera Zamagni, ''The economic history of Italy 1860–1990'' (Oxford University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; As industries came close to failure they were bought out by the banks in a largely illusionary bail-out—the assets used to fund the purchases were largely worthless. This led to a financial crisis peaking in 1932 and major government intervention. The [[Industrial Reconstruction Institute]] (IRI) was formed in January 1933 and took control of the bank-owned companies, suddenly giving Italy the largest state-owned industrial sector in Europe (excluding the USSR). IRI did rather well with its new responsibilities—restructuring, modernising and rationalising as much as it could. It was a significant factor in post-1945 development. But it took the Italian economy until 1935 to recover the manufacturing levels of 1930—a position that was only 60% better than that of 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Fabrizio Mattesini, and Beniamino Quintieri. "Italy and the Great Depression: An analysis of the Italian economy, 1929–1936." ''Explorations in Economic History'' (1997) 34#3 pp: 265–294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fabrizio Mattesini and Beniamino Quintieri. "Does a reduction in the length of the working week reduce unemployment? Some evidence from the Italian economy during the Great Depression." ''Explorations in Economic History'' (2006), 43#3, pp: 413–437.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The Great Depression did not strongly affect Japan. The Japanese economy shrank by 8% during 1929–31. Japan's Finance Minister [[Takahashi Korekiyo]] was the first to implement what have come to be identified as [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian economic]] policies: first, by large fiscal stimulus involving [[deficit spending]]; and second, by devaluing [[Yen|the currency]]. Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures. Econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective.&lt;ref&gt;Myung Soo Cha, "Did Takahashi Korekiyo Rescue Japan from the Great Depression?", ''The Journal of Economic History'' 63, No. 1 (March 2003): 127–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The devaluation of the currency had an immediate effect. Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets. The deficit spending proved to be most profound and went into the purchase of munitions for the armed forces. By 1933, Japan was already out of the depression. By 1934, Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating, and to avoid inflation, moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions.

This resulted in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists, especially those in the army, culminating in his assassination in the course of the [[February 26 Incident]]. This had a [[chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government. From 1934, the military's dominance of the government continued to grow. Instead of reducing deficit spending, the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced, but did not eliminate inflation, which remained a problem until the end of World War&amp;nbsp;II.

The deficit spending had a transformative effect on Japan. Japan's industrial production doubled during the 1930s. Further, in 1929 the list of the largest firms in Japan was dominated by light industries, especially textile companies (many of Japan's automakers, such as [[Toyota]], have their roots in the textile industry). By 1940 [[light industry]] had been displaced by heavy industry as the largest firms inside the Japanese economy.&lt;ref&gt;(For more on the Japanese economy in the 1930s see "MITI and the Japanese Miracle" by [[Chalmers Johnson]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
{{Main|Great Depression in Latin America}}
Because of high levels of U.S. investment in Latin American economies, they were severely damaged by the Depression. Within the region, [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]] were particularly badly affected.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Thorp, ''Latin America in the 1930s: the role of the periphery in world crisis'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1929 crisis, links between the world economy and [[Latin America]]n economies had been established through American and British investment in Latin American exports to the world. As a result, Latin Americans export industries felt the depression quickly. World prices for commodities such as wheat, coffee and copper plunged. Exports from all of Latin America to the U.S. fell in value from $1.2 billion in 1929 to $335 million in 1933, rising to $660 million in 1940.

But on the other hand, the depression led the area governments to develop new local industries and expand consumption and production. Following the example of the New Deal, governments in the area approved regulations and created or improved welfare institutions that helped millions of new industrial workers to achieve a better standard of living.

===Netherlands===
{{Main|Great Depression in the Netherlands}}
From roughly 1931 to 1937, the [[Netherlands]] suffered a deep and exceptionally long depression. This depression was partly caused by the after-effects of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 in the U.S., and partly by internal factors in the Netherlands. Government policy, especially the very late dropping of the Gold Standard, played a role in prolonging the depression. The Great Depression in the Netherlands led to some political instability and riots, and can be linked to the rise of the Dutch national-socialist party [[Nationaal Socialistische Beweging|NSB]]. The depression in the Netherlands eased off somewhat at the end of 1936, when the government finally dropped the Gold Standard, but real economic stability did not return until after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Kossmann, ''The Low Countries: 1780–1940'' (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{Main|History of New Zealand#Great Depression}}
[[Dominion of New Zealand|New Zealand]] was especially vulnerable to worldwide depression, as it relied almost entirely on agricultural exports to the United Kingdom for its economy. The drop in exports led to a lack of disposable income from the farmers, who were the mainstay of the local economy. Jobs disappeared and wages plummeted, leaving people desperate and charities unable to cope. Work relief schemes were the only government support available to the unemployed, the rate of which by the early 1930s was officially around 15%, but unofficially nearly twice that level (official figures excluded Māori and women). In 1932, riots occurred among the unemployed in three of the country's main cities ([[Auckland]], [[Dunedin]], and [[Wellington]]). Many were arrested or injured through the tough official handling of these riots by police and volunteer "special constables".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/whatson/exhibitions/sliceofheaven/exhibition/SocialWelfare/Pages/Greatdepression.aspx Social Welfare and The State: Great Depression]", [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
{{Main|Economic history of Portugal}}
Already under the rule of a dictatorial junta, the [[Ditadura Nacional]], Portugal suffered no turbulent political effects of the Depression, although [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], already appointed Minister of Finance in 1928 greatly expanded his powers and in 1932 rose to [[Prime Minister of Portugal]] to found the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], an [[authoritarian]] [[corporatist]] dictatorship. With the budget balanced in 1929, the effects of the depression were relaxed through harsh measures towards [[budget balance]] and [[autarky]], causing social discontent but stability and, eventually, an impressive economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;José Cardozo, "The great depression and Portugal" in Michael Psalidopoulos, ed., ''The Great Depression in Europe: Economic Thought and Policy in a National Context'' (Athens: Alpha Bank, 2012), {{ISBN|9789609979368}}. pp. 361–94 [http://www.ics.ul.pt/rdonweb-docs/ICS_JLCardoso_Great_AI.pdf Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puerto Rico===
In the years immediately preceding the depression, negative developments in the island and world economies perpetuated an unsustainable cycle of subsistence for many Puerto Rican workers. The 1920s brought a dramatic drop in Puerto Rico's two primary exports, raw sugar and coffee, due to a devastating hurricane in 1928 and the plummeting demand from global markets in the latter half of the decade. 1930 unemployment on the island was roughly 36% and by 1933 Puerto Rico's per capita income dropped 30% (by comparison, unemployment in the United States in 1930 was approximately 8% reaching a height of 25% in 1933).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Deal for the Tropics|last=Rodriguez|first=Manuel|publisher=Markus Wiener|year=2011|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://herb.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/1510|title=Graph of U.S. Unemployment Rate: 1930–1945|last=|first=|date=|website=American Social History Project|access-date=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To provide relief and economic reform, the United States government and Puerto Rican politicians such as [[Carlos E. Chardón|Carlos Chardon]] and [[Luis Muñoz Marín|Luis Munoz Marin]] created and administered first the Puerto Rico Emergency Relief Administration (PRERA) 1933 and then in 1935, the [[Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration]] (PRRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History of Puerto Rico|last=Dietz|first=James|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1986|isbn=0-691-02248-8|location=Princeton|pages=154, 155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeI9DwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{Main|Great Depression in South Africa}}
As world trade slumped, demand for South African agricultural and mineral exports fell drastically. The [[Carnegie Commission of Investigation on the Poor White Question in South Africa|Carnegie Commission on Poor Whites]] had concluded in 1931 that nearly one third of [[Afrikaner]]s lived as paupers. The social discomfort caused by the depression was a contributing factor in the 1933 split between the "gesuiwerde" (purified) and "smelter" (fusionist) factions within the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] and the National Party's subsequent fusion with the [[South African Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan O'Meara, ''Volkskapitalisme: class, capital, and ideology in the development of Afrikaner nationalism, 1934–1948'' (Cambridge University Press, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.country-studies.com/south-africa/the-great-depression-and-the-1930s.html The Great Depression and the 1930S], Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment programs were begun that focused primarily on the white population.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Minnaar, "Unemployment and relief measures during the Great Depression (1929-1934)." ''Kleio'' 26.1 (1994): 45-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet Union was the world's sole [[communist state]] with very little international trade. Its economy was not tied to the rest of the world and was only slightly affected by the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Robert William Davies, Mark Harrison, and Stephen G. Wheatcroft, eds. ''The economic transformation of the Soviet Union, 1913–1945'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Its forced transformation from a rural to an industrial society succeeded in building up heavy industry, at the cost of millions of lives in rural Russia and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest, ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Depression, the Soviet economy was growing steadily, fuelled by intensive investment in heavy industry. The apparent economic success of the Soviet Union at a time when the capitalist world was in crisis led many Western intellectuals to view the Soviet system favorably. Jennifer Burns wrote:
{{quote|As the Great Depression ground on and unemployment soared, intellectuals began unfavorably comparing their faltering capitalist economy to Russian Communism. ... More than ten years after the Revolution, Communism was finally reaching full flower, according to ''New York Times'' reporter [[Walter Duranty]], a Stalin fan who vigorously debunked accounts of the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933|Ukraine famine]], a man-made disaster that would leave millions dead."&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Burns (2009).

Despite all of this, The Great Depression caused mass immigration to the Soviet Union, mostly from Finland and Germany. Soviet Russia was at first happy to help these immigrants settle, because they believed they were victims of capitalism who had come to help the Soviet cause. However, when the Soviet Union entered the war in 1941, most of these Germans and Finns were arrested and sent to Siberia, while their Russian-born children were placed in orphanages. Their fate is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genealogia.fi/emi/art/article237e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
{{Main|Economic history of Spain}}
Spain had a relatively isolated economy, with high protective tariffs and was not one of the main countries affected by the Depression. The banking system held up well, as did agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Tortella and Jordi Palafox, "Banking and Industry in Spain 1918–1936," ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1984), 13#2 Special Issue, pp. 81–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the most serious negative impact came after 1936 from the heavy destruction of infrastructure and manpower by the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war, 1936–39]]. Many talented workers were forced into permanent exile. By staying neutral in the Second World War, and selling to both sides, the economy avoided further disasters.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Harrison, ''Economic History of Modern Spain'' (1978), pp. 129–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
{{Main|Economy of Sweden}}
By the 1930s, Sweden had what America's ''Life magazine'' called in 1938 the "world's highest standard of living". Sweden was also the first country worldwide to recover completely from the Great Depression. Taking place in the midst of a short-lived government and a less-than-a-decade old Swedish democracy, events such as those surrounding [[Ivar Kreuger]] (who eventually committed suicide) remain infamous in Swedish history. The [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] under [[Per Albin Hansson]] formed their first long-lived government in 1932 based on strong [[Interventionism (economics)|interventionist]] and [[welfare state]] policies, monopolizing the office of [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] until 1976 with the sole and short-lived exception of [[Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp]]'s "summer cabinet" in 1936. During forty years of hegemony, it was the most successful political party in the history of Western liberal democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Göran Therborn]], "A Unique Chapter in the History of Democracy: The Swedish Social Democrats", in K.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10246, England, Arbeitslose vor Gewerkschaftshaus.jpg|thumb|right|Unemployed people in front of a workhouse in London, 1930]]
The World Depression broke at a time when the United Kingdom had still not fully recovered from the effects of the [[World War I|First World War]] more than a decade earlier. The country was driven off the [[gold standard]] in 1931.

The world financial crisis began to overwhelm Britain in 1931; investors across the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of £2.5 million per day.&lt;ref name="David Williams 1963"/&gt; Credits of £25 millions each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of £15 millions fiduciary note slowed, but did not reverse the British crisis. The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931. With deficits mounting, the bankers demanded a balanced budget; the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government agreed; it proposed to raise taxes, cut spending and most controversially, to cut unemployment benefits by 20%. The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement. MacDonald wanted to resign, but King George V insisted he remain and form an all-party coalition "[[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]]". The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on, along with a small cadre of Labour, but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government. Britain went off the gold standard, and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression. In the 1931 British election, the Labour Party was virtually destroyed, leaving MacDonald as Prime Minister for a largely Conservative coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the wars, 1918–1940'' (1955) pp 386–412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Oxborrow 1976 pp 67-73"/&gt;

The effects on the northern industrial areas of Britain were immediate and devastating, as demand for traditional industrial products collapsed. By the end of 1930 unemployment had more than doubled from 1 million to 2.5 million (20% of the insured workforce), and exports had fallen in value by 50%. In 1933, 30% of [[Glasgow|Glaswegians]] were unemployed due to the severe decline in heavy industry. In some towns and cities in the north east, unemployment reached as high as 70% as shipbuilding fell by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatdepression.co.uk/unemployment-during-the-great-depression/ Unemployment During The Great Depression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124124118/http://thegreatdepression.co.uk/unemployment-during-the-great-depression |date=2009-01-24 }}, thegreatdepression.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Hunger March, 1932|National Hunger March]] of September–October 1932 was the largest&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Chris and Bewes, Diccon; ''What Happened Where: A Guide To Places And Events In Twentieth-Century History'' p. 115; Routledge, 1997 {{ISBN|1-85728-533-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a series of [[hunger marches]] in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s. About 200,000 unemployed men were sent to the work camps, which continued in operation until 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/7842448.stm "Work camps that tackled Depression"], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the less industrial [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[Southern England]], the effects were short-lived and the later 1930s were a prosperous time. Growth in modern manufacture of electrical goods and a boom in the motor car industry was helped by a growing southern population and an expanding [[middle class]]. Agriculture also saw a boom during this period.&lt;ref name="Social Conditions in Britain 1918-1939"&gt;[[Stephen Constantine (historian)|Constantine, Stephen]] (1983), ''Social Conditions in Britain 1918–1939'', {{ISBN|0-416-36010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover's first measures to combat the depression were based on voluntarism by businesses not to reduce their workforce or cut wages. But businesses had little choice and wages were reduced, workers were laid off, and investments postponed.&lt;ref name="Peter Clemens 1954, p. 114"&gt;Peter Clemens, ''Prosperity, Depression and the New Deal: The USA 1890–1954'', Hodder Education, 4.

In June 1930 Congress approved the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] which raised tariffs on thousands of imported items. The intent of the Act was to encourage the purchase of American-made products by increasing the cost of imported goods, while raising revenue for the federal government and protecting farmers. Other nations increased tariffs on American-made goods in retaliation, reducing international trade, and worsening the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://future.state.gov/when/timeline/1921_timeline/smoot_tariff.html "Smoot-Hawley Tariff"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312055958/http://future.state.gov/when/timeline/1921_timeline/smoot_tariff.html |date=2009-03-12 }}, ''U.S. Department of State''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final attempt of the Hoover Administration to stimulate the economy was the passage of the [[Emergency Relief and Construction Act]] (ERA) which included funds for [[public works]] programs such as dams and the creation of the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) in 1932. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2&amp;nbsp;billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions. But $2&amp;nbsp;billion was not enough to save all the banks, and [[bank run]]s and bank failures continued.&lt;ref name="Peter Clemens 1954, p. 114"/&gt; Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill, as prices, profits and employment fell, leading to the [[Realigning election|political realignment]] in 1932 that brought to power [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. It is important to note, however, that after volunteerism failed, Hoover developed ideas that laid the framework for parts of the New Deal.

Shortly after President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] was inaugurated in 1933, drought and erosion combined to cause the [[Dust Bowl]], shifting hundreds of thousands of [[displaced persons]] off their farms in the Midwest. From his inauguration onward, Roosevelt argued that restructuring of the economy would be needed to prevent another depression or avoid prolonging the current one. New Deal programs sought to stimulate [[demand]] and provide work and relief for the impoverished through increased government spending and the institution of financial reforms.

During a "bank holiday" that lasted five days, the [[Emergency Banking Act]] was signed into law. It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under [[United States Department of Treasury|Treasury]] supervision, with federal loans available if needed. The [[Securities Act of 1933]] comprehensively regulated the securities industry. This was followed by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] which created the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Although amended, key provisions of both Acts are still in force. Federal insurance of [[Deposit account|bank deposits]] was provided by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]], and the [[Glass–Steagall Act]].

The [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] provided incentives to cut farm production in order to raise farming prices. The [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA) made a number of sweeping changes to the American economy. It forced businesses to work with government to set price codes through the NRA to fight [[deflation]]ary "cut-throat competition" by the setting of minimum prices and [[Minimum wage|wages]], labor standards, and competitive conditions in all industries. It encouraged unions that would raise wages, to increase the [[purchasing power]] of the [[working class]]. The NRA [[Schechter v. United States|was deemed unconstitutional]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1935.

These reforms, together with several other relief and recovery measures, are called the [[First New Deal]]. Economic stimulus was attempted through a new [[Alphabet agencies|alphabet soup of agencies]] set up in 1933 and 1934 and previously extant agencies such as the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]]. By 1935, the "[[Second New Deal]]" added [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] (which was later considerably extended through the [[Fair Deal]]), a jobs program for the unemployed (the [[Works Progress Administration]], WPA) and, through the [[National Labor Relations Board]], a strong stimulus to the growth of labor unions. In 1929, federal expenditures constituted only 3% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. The national debt as a proportion of GNP rose under Hoover from 20% to 40%. Roosevelt kept it at 40% until the war began, when it soared to 128%.

By 1936, the main [[economic indicator]]s had regained the levels of the late 1920s, except for unemployment, which remained high at 11%, although this was considerably lower than the 25% unemployment rate seen in 1933. In the spring of 1937, American industrial production exceeded that of 1929 and remained level until June 1937. In June 1937, the Roosevelt administration cut spending and increased taxation in an attempt to balance the federal budget.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldston, ''The Great Depression'', Fawcett Publications, 1968, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;
The American economy then took a sharp downturn, lasting for 13 months through most of 1938. Industrial production fell almost 30 per cent within a few months and production of [[durable good]]s fell even faster. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938, rising from 5 million to more than 12 million in early 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''Economic Fluctuations'', Maurice W. Lee, Chairman of Economics Dept., Washington State College, published by R. D. Irwin Inc, Homewood, Illinois, 1955, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturing output fell by 37% from the 1937 peak and was back to 1934 levels.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Cycles'', James Arthur Estey, Purdue University, Prentice-Hall, 1950, pp. 22–23 chart.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wpa1.JPG|thumb|The [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] employed 2–3 million at unskilled labor.]]

Producers reduced their expenditures on durable goods, and inventories declined, but personal income was only 15% lower than it had been at the peak in 1937. As unemployment rose, consumers' expenditures declined, leading to further cutbacks in production. By May 1938 retail sales began to increase, employment improved, and industrial production turned up after June 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice W. Lee, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; After the recovery from the Recession of 1937–38, conservatives were able to form a bipartisan [[conservative coalition]] to stop further expansion of the New Deal and, when unemployment dropped to 2% in the early 1940s, they abolished WPA, CCC and the PWA relief programs. Social Security remained in place.

Between 1933 and 1939, federal expenditure tripled, and Roosevelt's critics charged that he was turning America into a [[Socialism|socialist]] state.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, Jr., Arthur M.

[[Keynesianism]] generally remained the most influential economic school in the United States and in parts of Europe until the periods between the 1970s and the 1980s, when [[Milton Friedman]] and other [[neoliberal]] economists formulated and propagated the newly created theories of [[neoliberalism]] and incorporated them into the [[Chicago School of Economics]] as an alternative approach to the study of economics. Neoliberalism went on to challenge the dominance of the Keynesian school of Economics in the mainstream academia and policy-making in the United States, having reached its peak in popularity in the election of the presidency of [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States, and [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lanny Ebenstein]], ''Milton Friedman: A Biography'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression has been the subject of much writing, as authors have sought to evaluate an era that caused both financial and emotional trauma. Perhaps the most noteworthy and famous novel written on the subject is ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', published in 1939 and written by [[John Steinbeck]], who was awarded both the [[Nobel Prize]] for literature and the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for the work. The novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers who are forced from their home as drought, economic hardship, and changes in the [[Agriculture|agricultural industry]] occur during the Great Depression. Steinbeck's ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' is another important novella about a journey during the Great Depression. Additionally, Harper Lee's ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' is set during the Great Depression. Margaret Atwood's Booker prize-winning ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' is likewise set in the Great Depression, centering on a privileged socialite's love affair with a Marxist revolutionary. The era spurred the resurgence of social realism, practiced by many who started their writing careers on relief programs, especially the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;David Taylor, ''Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerre Mangione, ''The Dream and the Deal: The Federal Writers' Project, 1935–1943'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Hirsch, ''Portrait of America: A Cultural History of the Federal Writers' Project'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stacy I.

A number of works for younger audiences are also set during the Great Depression, among them the [[Kit Kittredge]] series of ''[[American Girl]]'' books written by [[Valerie Tripp]] and illustrated by [[Walter Rane]], released to tie in with the dolls and playsets sold by the company. The stories, which take place during the early to mid 1930s in [[Cincinnati]], focuses on the changes brought by the Depression to the titular character's family and how the Kittredges dealt with it.&lt;ref name="Communications2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harry|first=Lou|title=Cincinnati Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0CAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=10 July 2017|date=1 October 2010|publisher=Emmis Communications|pages=59–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theatrical adaptation of the series entitled ''[[Kit Kittredge: An American Girl]]'' was later released in 2008 to positive reviews.&lt;ref name="Morency"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morency|first=Philip|title=On the Aisle, Volume 2: Film Reviews by Philip Morency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGyM0Bhsr-QC&amp;pg=PA133|publisher=Dorrance Publishing|isbn=9781434977090|pages=133–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pimpare2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pimpare|first=Stephen|title=Ghettos, Tramps, and Welfare Queens: Down and Out on the Silver Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCrADgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA216|accessdate=10 July 2017|year=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190660727|pages=216–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''Christmas After All'', part of the ''[[Dear America]]'' series of books for older girls, take place in 1930s [[Indianapolis]]; while ''Kit Kittredge'' is told in a third-person viewpoint, ''Christmas After All'' is in the form of a fictional journal as told by the protagonist Minnie Swift as she recounts her experiences during the era, especially when her family takes in an orphan cousin from Texas.&lt;ref name="Smith2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Robert W.|title=Spotlight on America: The Great Depression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZhrdFflrzEC|accessdate=10 July 2017|date=2006-01-26|publisher=Teacher Created Resources|isbn=9781420632187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
{{Further|Depression (economics)}}
The term "The Great Depression" is most frequently attributed to British economist [[Lionel Robbins]], whose 1934 book ''The Great Depression'' is credited with formalizing the phrase,&lt;ref name="hnn"&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/61931.html When Did the Great Depression Receive Its Name? (And Who Named It?)], 2-16-09, by Noah Mendel, [[History News Network]]&lt;/ref&gt; though Hoover is widely credited with popularizing the term,&lt;ref name="hnn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Manchester, ''The Glory and the Dream: A Narrative History of America, 1932–1972''.&lt;/ref&gt; informally referring to the downturn as a depression, with such uses as "Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement" (December 1930, Message to Congress), and "I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression" (1931).

[[File:Schwarzer Freitag Wien 1873.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Black Friday, 9 May 1873, Vienna Stock Exchange. The [[Panic of 1873]] and [[Long Depression]] followed.]]
The term "[[Depression (economics)|depression]]" to refer to an economic downturn dates to the 19th century, when it was used by varied Americans and British politicians and economists. Indeed, the first major American economic crisis, the [[Panic of 1819]], was described by then-president [[James Monroe]] as "a depression",&lt;ref name="hnn"/&gt; and the most recent economic crisis, the [[Depression of 1920–21]], had been referred to as a "depression" by then-president [[Calvin Coolidge]].

Financial crises were traditionally referred to as "panics", most recently the major [[Panic of 1907]], and the minor [[Panic of 1910–11]], though the 1929 crisis was called "The Crash", and the term "panic" has since fallen out of use. At the time of the Great Depression, the term "The Great Depression" was already used to refer to the period 1873–96 (in the United Kingdom), or more narrowly 1873–79 (in the United States), which has retroactively been renamed the [[Long Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=T.

===Other "great depressions"===
Other economic downturns have been called a "great depression", but none had been as widespread, or lasted for so long. Various nations have experienced brief or extended periods of economic downturns, which were referred to as "depressions", but none have had such a widespread global impact.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The [[causes of the Great Recession]] seem similar to the Great Depression, but significant differences exist. The previous chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]], [[Ben Bernanke]], had extensively studied the Great Depression as part of his doctoral work at MIT, and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in ways that were not done in the 1930s. Generally speaking, the recovery of the world's financial systems tended to be quicker during the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the [[late-2000s recession]].

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;If we contrast the 1930s with the Crash of 2008 where gold went through the roof, it is clear that the U.S. dollar on the gold standard was a completely different animal in comparison to the fiat free-floating U.S. dollar currency we have today. Both currencies in 1929 and 2008 were the U.S. dollar, but in an analogous way it is as if one was a Saber-toothed tiger and the other is a Bengal tiger; they are two completely different animals. Where we have experienced inflation since the Crash of 2008, the situation was much different in the 1930s when deflation set in. Unlike the deflation of the early 1930s, the U.S. economy currently appears to be in a "liquidity trap," or a situation where monetary policy is unable to stimulate an economy back to health.

In terms of the stock market, nearly three years after the 1929 crash, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|DJIA]] dropped 8.4% on August 12, 1932. Where we have experienced great volatility with large intraday swings in the past two months, in 2011, we have not experienced any record-shattering daily percentage drops to the tune of the 1930s. Where many of us may have that '30s feeling, in light of the DJIA, the CPI, and the national unemployment rate, we are simply not living in the '30s. Some individuals may feel as if we are living in a depression, but for many others the current [[financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] simply does not feel like a depression akin to the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, Marco (October 6, 2011).

1928 and 1929 were the times in the 20th century that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes;&lt;ref&gt;Evans-Pritchard, Ambrose (September 14, 2010). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/8000561/IMF-fears-social-explosion-from-world-jobs-crisis.html "IMF Fears 'Social Explosion' From World Jobs Crisis"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (London). "America and Europe face the worst jobs crisis since the 1930s and risk 'an explosion of social unrest' unless they tread carefully, the International Monetary Fund has warned."&lt;/ref&gt; half the unemployed had been out of work for over six months, something that was not repeated until the late-2000s recession. 2007 and 2008 eventually saw the world reach new levels of wealth gap inequality that rivalled the years of 1928 and 1929.

'''Helen Jewett''' (October 18, 1813 – April 10, 1836) was an upscale New York City prostitute&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Patricia Cline|title=The Mystery of Helen Jewett: Romantic Fiction and the Eroticization of Violence|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/lstf17&amp;div=&amp;id=151&amp;page=|website=Hein Online|accessdate=31 March 2018|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose murder, along with the subsequent trial and acquittal of her alleged killer, [[Richard P. Robinson]], generated an unprecedented amount of media coverage.&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt;

==Early history==
Jewett was born Dorcas Doyen&lt;ref&gt;The trial of Richard P. Robinson for the murder of Helen Jewett. New York City, 1836 In : American state trials / John D.Lawson, editor pp 426-487 Wilmington, Del. : Scholarly Resources, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Temple, Maine]], into a working-class family. Her father was an alcoholic; her mother died when Jewett was young. From the age of 12 or 13 Jewett was employed as a servant girl in the home of Chief Justice Nathan Weston of the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]]. While there, she developed into a sexually assertive young woman, and upon reaching the age of 18 left the Weston home at the first opportunity. She moved to [[Portland, Maine]], where she worked as a prostitute under an assumed name. She subsequently moved to [[Boston]] and finally New York under a succession of fake names.&lt;ref name="ramslan" /&gt;

==The murder==
Jewett's body was discovered by the matron of the brothel, Rosina Townsend, at 3 a.m. on April 10, 1836.&lt;ref name="ramslan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramsland|first1=Katherine|title=The sensational murder of Helen Jewett, gorgeous NY prostitute|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/classics/helen_jewett/index.html|website=Crime Library|accessdate=31 March 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004900/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/classics/helen_jewett/index.html |archive-date= 2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The murder had taken place sometime after midnight.  Jewett was struck on the head three times with a sharp object.  (The [[coroner]]'s report called it a 'hatchet'.)&lt;ref name="ramslan" /&gt;  Based on the position of the corpse in bed, the coroner concluded that the blows were not expected: there were no signs of struggle.&lt;ref name="ramslan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cohen2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cline Cohen|first1=Patricia|title=The Murder of Helen Jewett The Life and Death of a Prostitute in Nineteenth-Century New York|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/c/cohen-jewett.html|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After inflicting the lethal blows, the murderer then set fire to Jewett's bed.&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt;  Townsend discovered the room full of smoke, and Jewett's body charred on one side.&lt;ref name="ramslan" /&gt;

==The trial==
Based on the testimony of the women who lived in the brothel, the police arrested 19-year-old Richard P. Robinson on suspicion of Jewett's murder.&lt;ref name="ramslan" /&gt;  Robinson, a repeat customer of the victim, flatly denied killing her, and did not display much emotion even when confronted with the still warm corpse.&lt;ref name="ramslan" /&gt;  Nevertheless, based on the testimony of various witnesses and the recovery of a cloak that resembled Robinson's, the [[inquest|coroner's jury]], hastily assembled on the scene and made up of on-lookers, concluded that Jewett met her end "by blows ... inflicted ... with a hatchet by the hand of Richard P. Robinson." This was enough to gain an initial indictment.&lt;ref name="ramslan" /&gt;

On June 2, 1836, Robinson's trial for murder began. Ex-D.A. of New York [[Ogden Hoffman]] appeared for the defence.&lt;ref name="ramslan" /&gt; After days of testimony from several witnesses, including Rosina Townsend, the judge gave the jury its instructions. As most of the witnesses were other prostitutes, the judge ordered his jury to disregard their testimony. Presented primarily with circumstantial evidence against Robinson, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty in less than a half hour.&lt;ref name="ramslan" /&gt;

==The press==
Jewett's murder excited the press and the public. The coverage of the murder and trial was highly polarized, with reporters either sympathizing with Jewett and vilifying Robinson or attacking Jewett as a seductress who deserved her fate. The ''[[New York Herald]]'', edited by [[James Gordon Bennett, Sr.]], provided the most complete (if not unbiased) coverage of the sensational murder.&lt;ref name="ramslan" /&gt; Almost from the beginning and throughout the trial, Bennett insisted that Robinson was the innocent victim of a vicious conspiracy launched by the police and Jewett's madam. He also emphasized the sensational nature of the story and worked to exploit the sexual, violent details of Jewett's death.&lt;ref name="ramslan" /&gt; The New York ''[[The Sun (New York City)|Sun]]'', on the other hand, whose readers tended to come from the working class, argued that Robinson was guilty and that he was able to use money and the influence of wealthy relatives and his employer to buy an acquittal.  This theory continued to gain traction for many years later.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'',  6 August 1899: ‘GLIMPSE OF OLD NEW YORK: John H. Welsh, Who Has Lived Here Seventy-five Years, Reminiscent.: ...The house Helen Jewett was murdered in, 41 Thomas Street, is standing yet...Richard P. Robinson, who was clerk for Joseph Hoxie at 100 Maiden Lane, was tried for it, but acquitted.  He had influential and rich relations and was a leader of the fast set of his day.’&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notably, the trial was largely responsible for nationwide changes in the approach to sex and scandal coverage by American journalists.&lt;ref name="buck"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buck|first1=Stephanie|title=The salacious murder of this New York City prostitute changed the American media landscape|url=https://timeline.com/helen-jewett-murder-7acc3cc812c|website=Timeline|accessdate=31 March 2018|date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sensationalism and the New York Press / John D. Stevens / New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the case, coverage of such topics by major newspapers was nearly nonexistent. Additionally, some historians credit Bennett with the first journalistic interview, namely that of Rosina Townsend.&lt;ref&gt;The Origins of the Interview. In : Journalism Quarterly 48 / Niles G. Nilsson, pp 101-13, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, however, argue that Bennett never actually talked to Townsend and that his reported interview was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;Tucher 1994, pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Trial==
Personal letters of Robinson's that became public after the trial undercut some of his claims and showed him to be capable of vicious and (for the time) deviant sexual behavior and the public turned on him, including some who had been his vocal supporters.&lt;ref name="buck" /&gt;  Robinson eventually moved to Texas where he became a respected frontier citizen.&lt;ref name="buck" /&gt;

==References in popular culture==
Jewett and Robinson are the subject of ''The Lives of Helen Jewett, And Richard P. Robinson'', an 1849 novel by journalist [[George Wilkes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkes|first1=George|last2=Howard|first2=H. R.|title=The Lives of Helen Jewett, and Richard P. Robinson (1849)|date=2009|publisher=Lightning Source|isbn=9781104917449|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pWFvQQAACAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novel was originally published in serial form in Wilkes' newspaper the ''[[National Police Gazette]]''.  This story is a fictionalized narrative based around the stories about Jewett and Robinson that circulated after the murder.

Jewett is a character in the novel [[Burr (novel)|''Burr'']] by [[Gore Vidal]]—being the love interest of the narrator. Although her murder is peripheral to the story, it is foreshadowed throughout by [[Aaron Burr|the title character]]'s having secured, in a notorious trial at the turn of the century, the acquittal of [[Levi Weeks]], the apparent murderer of [[Elma Sands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Susan|last2=Gibson|first2=Curtis S.|title=Gore Vidal: A Critical Companion|date=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313295799|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XWtMF1sl9twC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=Jewett+burr+vidal#v=onepage&amp;q=Jewett%20burr%20vidal&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6120">In [[United States labor law]], a '''hostile work environment''' exists when one's behavior within a workplace creates an environment that is difficult or uncomfortable for another person to work in, due to discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eeolaws.blogspot.com/2017/12/establishing-hostile-work-environment.html Berry, John, Establishing a Hostile Work Environment (EEO Law Blog 2017)]"&lt;/ref&gt; Common complaints in [[sexual harassment]] lawsuits include fondling, suggestive remarks, sexually-suggestive photos displayed in the workplace, use of sexual language, or [[Off-color humor|off-color jokes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of Human Resource Management|date=October 4, 2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|isbn=978-0073530468|pages=78|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small issues, annoyances, and isolated incidents typically are not considered illegal. To be unlawful, the conduct must create a work environment that would be [[intimidation|intimidating]], [[hostility|hostile]], or offensive to a [[reasonable person]]. An employer can be held liable for failing to prevent these workplace conditions, unless it can prove that it attempted to prevent the [[workplace harassment|harassment]] and that the employee failed to take advantage of existing harassment counter-measures or tools provided by the employer.&lt;ref name="EEOCharass"&gt;{{cite web |title=Harassment |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/harassment.cfm |publisher=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |accessdate=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hostile work environment may also be created when management acts in a manner designed to make an employee [[resignation|quit]] in [[Organizational retaliatory behavior|retaliation]] for some action. For example, if an employee reported safety violations at work, was injured, attempted to join a [[trade union|union]], or reported regulatory violations by management, and management's response was to harass and pressure the employee to quit. Employers have tried to force employees to quit by imposing unwarranted discipline, reducing hours, cutting wages, or transferring the complaining employee to a distant work location.

The [[United States Supreme Court]] stated in ''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/523/75/case.html], Oncale v. Sundowner, Case Text&lt;/ref&gt; that Title VII is "not a general civility code." Thus, federal law does not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not extremely serious. Rather, the conduct must be so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the individual's employment. The conditions of employment are altered only if the harassment culminates in a [[tangibility|tangible]] [[employment action]] or is sufficiently severe or pervasive.

==Burdens of proof==
Where a hostile environment is alleged, the legality of behaviors must be determined on a case by case basis. In the workplace, such a claim focuses on the working conditions that must be endured by the victim as a condition of employment, rather than on tangible job changes. To establish whether the situation is actionable the "totality of circumstances" must be weighed with an eye to determining "that the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment in that it was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the condition of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment".&lt;ref&gt;Pellicciotti, Joseph M. ''Title VII Iiability for sexual harassment in the workplace''. Alexandria, Va. International Personnel Management Association, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to other laws ==
In many United States jurisdictions, a hostile work environment is not an independent legal claim. That is, an employee can not file a lawsuit on the basis of a hostile work environment alone. Instead, an employee must prove they have been treated in a hostile manner ''because'' of their membership in a protected class, such as gender, age, race, national origin, disability status, and similar protected traits.&lt;ref name="EEOCharass"/&gt; Importantly, the hostile work environment is gender neutral, that is, men can sexually harass men or women and women can sexually harass men or women.

Likewise, a hostile work environment can be considered the "adverse employment action" that is an element of a [[Whistleblower protection in the United States|whistleblower claim]] or a reprisal (retaliation) claim under a civil rights statute. When an employee claims that a hostile work environment is an adverse employment action, the legal analysis is similar to the burdens of proof described above. However, to recover damages, the employee must also establish all other elements of the claim, such as that the employee engaged in protected conduct such as making a report of discrimination or reporting an employer's violation of law, and also establish that the employer created the hostile work environment, at least in part, because the employee engaged in the protected activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2164">"'''I Want to Kiss Ringo Goodbye'''" is a 1965 [[novelty single]] recorded by English music journalist [[Penny Valentine]] at the start of her journalistic career. The song was released in March 1965 at the height of [[Beatlemania]] and is about [[Ringo Starr]], the drummer of [[The Beatles]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.be/books?id=WLsVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT102&amp;lpg=PT102&amp;dq=penny+valentine+I+want+to+kiss+ringo+goodbye&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FI9VocFpMu&amp;sig=t-iV_XTU07Q8gV-QM3cLVFKSQnA&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjai6X7voLbAhVBK1AKHRe-BwYQ6AEIUzAK#v=onepage&amp;q=penny%20valentine%20I%20want%20to%20kiss%20ringo%20goodbye&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.be/books?id=WLsVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT102&amp;lpg=PT102&amp;dq=I+want+to+kiss+ringo+goodbye&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FI9VocFrPv&amp;sig=dB5SIDHmT42gealtHaWNbM-xuyU&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTkJrpv4LbAhXMB5oKHS5zCngQ6AEISDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20want%20to%20kiss%20ringo%20goodbye&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;The song was produced by [[Chuck Sagle]] and written by Sagle under the pseudonyms Bob Strong and Carl Stevens.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=szQhAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=%22Sagle%22+%22carl+stevens%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ4be66-DbAhWTN30KHSgNAkYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sagle%22%20%22carl%20stevens%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[B-side]] was "Show Me the Way to Love You", composed by [[Doug Goodwin]] and produced by Sagle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.45cat.com/record/55774&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.discogs.com/es/Penny-Valentine-I-Want-To-Kiss-Ringo-Goodbye-Show-Me-The-Way-To-Love-You/release/8989096&lt;/ref&gt;

The lyrics are told from the viewpoint of a girl who feels sad because [[Ringo Starr]] is about to get married. As she loved the musician and feels jealous of the woman whom he is about to marry she wants to kiss him goodbye before the wedding. In real life Ringo Starr had indeed married on 11 February 1965 with [[Maureen Cox]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.beatlesbible.com/1965/02/11/ringo-starr-marries-maureen-cox/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Indians''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[Arthur Kopit]].

At its core is [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] and his ''Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show''. The play examines the contradictions of Cody's life and his work with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. [[Alvin Klein]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that the play intended "...to open up the real savage story of how the West was won, to demythologize that old game of cowboys and Indians..."&lt;ref name=alvin&gt;Klein, Alvin.

==Productions==
''Indians'' premiered in [[London]] in July 1968 in a production by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] at the [[Aldwych Theatre]], directed by [[Jack Gelber]].&lt;ref name=alvin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hennessy, Brendan.

==Analysis==
Michael Patterson, professor of Theater at De Montfort University, Leicester), wrote in ''The Oxford Guide to Plays'' that "Kopit turned to a more serious political investigation of the white settlers' treatment of Native Americans... Kopit's play was one of the first major pieces to confront the issue and to relate it to continuing genocide in South-East Asia."&lt;ref&gt;
Patterson, Michael. ''Indians'', ''The Oxford Guide to Plays'', Oxford University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0198604181}}, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otis Guernsey Jr.|Otis L. Guernsey]] wrote in ''Curtain Times: The New York Theatre, 1965-1987'' that "the best script of the 1969-70 bests, in our opinion, was ''Indians'', about the opening of the American West... It is destined, certainly, for an illustrious career...where it will enhance the reputation of American playwriting...''Indians'' reached its...fulfillment not in the events on the stage...but out in the auditorium where we were forced to re-examine some of our value judgments through a crack in our beloved national epic of the Old Wild West."&lt;ref&gt;Guernsey, Otis L. "Broadway", ''Curtain Times: The New York Theatre, 1965-1987'', Hal Leonard Corporation, 1987, {{ISBN|0936839244}}, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Lahr]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote: "''Indians'' deals with the most incendiary truth: myth being created to justify a lost dream."&lt;ref&gt;Lahr, John. [https://archive.is/20130208231249/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/08/john_lahr_digs.php "On-Stage. Review of 'Indians'"] ''The Village Voice'' October 16, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jewish revolt against Heraclius''' was part of the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]] and is considered the last serious Jewish attempt for gaining autonomy in Palestine prior to modern times. According to a recent theory, the revolt and the general Byzantine-Persian War took place during the [[Late Antique Little Ice Age]], which marked the decline of the classic empires, demographic and economic collapse across the Near East and rise of opportunistic forces, such as Muslim Arabs and Turks.

Following the [[Battle of Antioch (613)|Battle of Antioch]] in 613, [[Shahrbaraz]] led his forces through [[Palaestina Secunda]] and into [[Palaestina Prima]] provinces.&lt;ref name = "sasanianTimes"/&gt;{{rp| 123}} In 614, Shahrbaraz [[Siege of Caesarea (614)|conquered Caesarea Maritima]], the administrative capital of the Palaestina Prima province.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 206}} The Persian army reinforced by Jewish forces led by [[Nehemiah ben Hushiel]] and [[Benjamin of Tiberias]] would shortly capture Jerusalem without resistance.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 207}} After only a few months a Christian revolt occurred. Nehemiah ben Hushiel and his council of sixteen righteous were killed along with many other Jews, some throwing themselves off the city walls.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 69–71}}&lt;ref name = "Nehemiah"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Minora"/&gt;{{rp|169}} Christians were able to briefly retake the city before the walls were breached by Shahrbaraz’s forces who lay siege to the city.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 207}} According to the Armenian bishop and historian [[Sebeos]] the siege resulted in a total Christian death toll of 17,000,&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 207}} Christian sources later exaggerated the extent of the massacre, claiming a death toll as high as 90,000.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 207–208}} In addition 35,000 or 37,000 people including the patriarch Zacharias are said to have been deported to Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 69–71}}&lt;ref name = "sasanianTimes"/&gt;{{rp| 123}}&lt;ref name="Jane S.

Bands of Jews from Jerusalem, Tiberias, Galilee, Damascus, and even from Cyprus, united and undertook an incursion against Tyre, having been invited by the 4,000 Jewish inhabitants of that city to surprise and massacre the Christians on Easter night. The Jewish army is said to have consisted of 20,000 men. The expedition, however, miscarried, as the Christians of Tyre learned of the impending danger, and seized the 4,000 Tyrian Jews as hostages. The Jewish invaders destroyed the churches around Tyre, an act which the Christians avenged by killing two thousand of their Jewish prisoners. The besiegers, to save the remaining prisoners, withdrew.&lt;ref name =" jewishencyclopedia"/&gt; The Jews had hoped that [[Khosrau II]] would give them all of the [[Land of Israel]] in exchange for their support. By 617 CE the Persians had reversed their policy and sided with the Christians over the Jews, probably because of pressure from Mesopotamian Christians in Persia itself.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 208}}&lt;ref name = "Psychoanalytic"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z10-Xz9Kno4C&amp;pg=PA347#v=onepage&amp;q=614&amp;f=false| title = A Psychoanalytic History of the Jews| year = 1996| pages =353–354| author = Avner Falk | accessdate = 2014-03-10 | publisher = Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 622 CE, the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]] had assembled an army to retake the territory lost to the [[Sasanian Empire]].&lt;ref name = "Nehemiah"/&gt; In 628, following the deposition of [[Khosrau II]], [[Kavadh II]] made peace with Heraclius, but Kavadh II would only have a brief reign.

Some historians believe the war reduced and weakened the Christian population not just in Jerusalem but across the Near East, allowing the success of the following Arab invasion.

Jews and Samaritans were persecuted frequently by the Byzantines (eastern Romans) resulting in numerous [[Samaritan Revolts|revolts]].

A pogrom in [[Antioch]] in 608 would lead to a Jewish revolt in 610 which was crushed. Jews also revolted in both [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in 610. The Jews of Tyre were massacred in reprisal. Unlike in earlier times when Jews had supported Christians in the fight against [[Shapur I]], the Byzantines had now become viewed as oppressors.&lt;ref name = "sasanianTimes"&gt;{{cite book |title= a history of the jews in babylonia v. later sasanian times |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zrM3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=610+pogrom&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PH8fU7zbFMHLqQHvwoCIBg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=610%20pogrom&amp;f=false | author = Jacob Neusner |publisher = Brill Archive|year = 1970 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 122}}

The territory is said to have had a substantial indigenous Jewish population at this time. [[James Parkes (clergyman)|James Parkes]] estimates that if ten percent of the Jewish population joined the revolt and the figure of 20,000 rebels is correct then 200,000 Jews were living in the territory at the time.&lt;ref name="hp"/&gt;{{rp| 65}} Likewise [[Michael Avi-Yonah]] used the figure of Jewish combatants to arrive at an estimate of the total Jewish population. He gives a figure of 150,000 to 200,000 living in 43 Jewish settlements. [[Salo Wittmayer Baron]] in 1957 questioned the reliability of the number of Jewish combatants recorded in ancient texts and the population estimates based on these texts, although he does not discount the estimate altogether. He reasons that the 43 Jewish settlements Avi-Yonah lists may indeed be supportive of a minority Jewish presence of 10 to 15%.&lt;ref name=" vol3 "&gt;{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xrUh7xGY0wIC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=jews+150,000+43+settlements++614&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAWoVChMIluuc59nKxgIVRlk-Ch1hjwFK#v=onepage&amp;q=jews%20150%2C000%2043%20settlements%20%20614&amp;f=false| title = Social and Religious History of the Jews, Volume 3: High Middle Ages: Heirs of Rome and Persia |authors= Salo Wittmayer Baron | publisher = Columbia University Press|pages = 237| year = 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Neusner]] similarly accepts this estimate.&lt;ref name = "sasanianTimes"/&gt;{{rp| 124}} In 1950 Israel Cohen gave an estimate of double these values, estimating that between 300,000 and 400,000 Jews were in the land.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Cohen (1950).

Jews are thought to have been concentrated in the [[Galilee]] during this time period. The Galilee is said to have contained several cities which are thought to have been populated largely by a homogenous Jewish demographic, [[Tiberias]] being a center of Jewish learning.

===Galilee and Caesarea===
Following the [[Battle of Antioch (613)|Battle of Antioch]] in 613, [[Shahrbaraz]] led his forces through Palaestina Secunda and into Palaestina Prima provinces.&lt;ref name = "sasanianTimes"/&gt;{{rp| 123}} Shahrbaraz [[Siege of Caesarea (614)|conquered Caesarea Maritima]], the administrative capital of the Palaestina Prima province.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 206}} When Shahrbaraz had entered Galilee, a significant Jewish revolt took place with some 20,000 Jewish rebels joining him in the war against the Byzantines.&lt;ref name = "sasanianTimes"/&gt;{{rp| 123}}&lt;ref name =" jewishencyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |url = http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4356-chosroes-khosru-ii-parwiz| title = Jewish Encyclopedia CHOSROES (KHOSRU) II.

===Capture of Jerusalem===
{{main|Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem}}
The Persian army reinforced by Jewish forces led by Nehemiah ben Hushiel and Benjamin of Tiberias would capture Jerusalem without resistance.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 207}}

The capture of Jerusalem was interpreted by Jewish writers in a messianic context. Sacrifices may even have been renewed on the [[Temple Mount]].&lt;ref name = "Minora"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u8xsv4Pqk-EC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=solving+the+qilliri+riddle+fleischer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3AiIVNGjHoGfgwSylIOoCQ&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=solving%20the%20qilliri%20riddle%20fleischer&amp;f=false | title = Judaica Minora: Geschichte und Literatur des rabbinischen Judentums| author= Günter Stemberger | publisher =Mohr Siebeck| year = 2010| accessdate = 17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168–169}} Control of the city was handed to [[Nehemiah ben Hushiel]] and [[Benjamin of Tiberias]].

Reeves.  University of North Carolina at Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian rebellion===
After only a few months a Christian revolt occurred. Nehemiah ben Hushiel and his council of sixteen righteous were killed along with many other Jews, some throwing themselves off the city walls.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 69–71}}&lt;ref name = "Nehemiah"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Minora"/&gt;{{rp|169}}

Following the outburst of violence in Jerusalem, the surviving Jews fled to [[Shahrbaraz]]’s encampment at [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]]. Christians were able to briefly retake the city before the walls were breached by Shahrbaraz’s forces who lay siege to the city.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 207}} Sources vary on how long the siege lasted. Depending on the source it lasted 19, 20 or 21 days.

According to the Armenian bishop and historian [[Sebeos]] the siege resulted in a total Christian death toll of 17,000,&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 207}} 4,518 prisoners were massacred near [[Mamilla Pool|Mamilla reservoir]] per [[Antiochus of Palestine|Antiochus Strategos]].&lt;ref name="bibleinterp.com"&gt;[http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/pers357904.shtml The Persian Conquest of Jerusalem (614 CE) – an archeological assessment] by Gideon Avni, Director of the Excavations and Surveys Department of the Israel Antiquities Authority.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Howard-Johnston]] argues that the massacre occurred in the context of the returning Jews attempting to round up the ring leaders who had led the earlier pogrom.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 207–208}} Christian sources later exaggerated the extent of the massacre, claiming a death toll as high as 90,000.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 207–208}}  In addition 35,000 or 37,000 people including the patriarch Zacharias are said to have been deported to Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 69–71}}&lt;ref name = "sasanianTimes"/&gt;{{rp| 123}}&lt;ref name="Jane S. Gerber 1994 15"/&gt; The city is said to have been burnt down. However, neither wide spread burning nor destruction of churches have been found in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name = "Phoenicia"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bibleinterp.com/&gt; The search for the [[True Cross]] is said to have involved the torture of clergymen.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 207}} Once found, the True Cross was carried off to [[Ctesiphon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= International Dictionary of Historic Places: Middle East and Africa, Volume 4|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=R44VRnNCzAYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=Ctesiphon+true+cross&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KcMgU_TQFuLCyQGWvYDgBA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ctesiphon%20true%20cross&amp;f=false| editors = Trudy Ring, Robert M.

Unlike Sebeos, Antiochus uses polemical language.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 206–207, 195}} Antiochus wrote that the Jews offered to help the Christian captives escape death if they "become Jews and deny Christ." They refused. In anger, the Jews then purchased Christians to kill them.&lt;ref name=Antiochus&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/antiochus_strategos_capture.htm|title=Antiochus Strategos' Account of the Sack of Jerusalem in A.D. 614 |authorlink=Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare |first=F.

A mass burial grave at [[Mamilla]] cave was discovered in 1989 by Israeli [[archeologist]] [[Ronny Reich]] near the site, where Antiochus recorded the massacre took place. The human remains were in poor condition containing a minimum of 526 individuals.&lt;ref name="antiquities.org.il"&gt;[http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=17&amp;sub_subj_id=179 "Human Skeletal Remains from the Mamilla cave, Jerusalem"] by Yossi Nagar.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish expedition to Tyre===
According to [[Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria|Eutychius]] (887-940), the Jews launched an expedition against Tyre.&lt;ref name ="Eutychius"&gt;{{cite book | url= https://archive.org/stream/libraryofpalesti11paleuoft#page/n57/mode/1up | title = Eucherius about certain holy places: The library of the Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society.|authors= Eutychius |publisher = Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund in London.| year = 1896 | accessdate= 28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 39–40}} Bands of Jews from Jerusalem, Tiberias, Galilee, Damascus, and even from Cyprus, united and undertook an incursion against Tyre, having been invited by the 4,000 Jewish inhabitants of that city to surprise and massacre the Christians on Easter night. The Jewish army is said to have consisted of 20,000 men. The expedition, however, miscarried, as the Christians of Tyre learned of the impending danger, and seized the 4,000 Tyrian Jews as hostages. The Jewish invaders destroyed the churches around Tyre, an act which the Christians avenged by killing two thousand of their Jewish prisoners. The besiegers, to save the remaining prisoners, withdrew,&lt;ref name =" jewishencyclopedia"/&gt; having had to suffer the humiliation of watching the heads of the Jewish captives as they were thrown over the walls.&lt;ref name ="Thousand"&gt;{{cite book |title= History of the Byzantine Jews: A Microcosmos in the Thousand Year Empire |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=r-9qJRP20MIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| author = Elli Kohen | publisher = University Press of America |year = 2007|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 37}}

===Jewish control of Jerusalem===
The Jews had hoped that [[Khosrau II]] would give them all of the [[Land of Israel]] in exchange for their support. However they were too few to make this a reality.&lt;ref name = "sasanianTimes"/&gt;{{rp| 124}} For a time they are said to have enjoyed relative dominance in Jerusalem,&lt;ref name = "Nehemiah"/&gt; although it may have been in a state of anarchy.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 208–209}} By 617 CE the Persians had reversed their policy and sided with the Christians over the Jews, probably because of pressure from Mesopotamian Christians in Persia itself.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 208}}&lt;ref name="Psychoanalytic"/&gt; Further Jewish settlers were banned from settling in or around Jerusalem and a small synagogue on the Temple Mount was also demolished.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;{{rp| 209–210}} Instead of supporting the Jews, Khosrau is said to have imposed heavy taxes on them.&lt;ref name =" jewishencyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Thousand"/&gt;{{rp| 37}}

===Byzantine return to Jerusalem===
By 622 CE, the Roman Emperor Heraclius had assembled an army to retake the territory lost to the [[Sasanian Empire]].&lt;ref name = "Nehemiah"/&gt; In 628, following the deposition of [[Khosrau II]], [[Kavadh II]] made peace with [[Heraclius]], but Kavadh II would only have a brief reign. The conquered city and the Cross would remain in Sasanian hands until they were returned by Shahrbaraz. On 21 March 630, Heraclius marched in triumph into Jerusalem with the True Cross.&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Francis"/&gt; Ancient manuscripts date Heraclius' entry into Jerusalem as 21 March 629.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Modern scholars increasingly doubt this date for a number of reasons.

====Dating Byzantine return====
Walter Emil Kaegi puts the death of Kavadh II in September 629.&lt;ref name ="Emperor"&gt;{{cite book |title= Heraclius, Emperor of Byzantium|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=Heraclius+629&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GwO1I28Bok&amp;sig=QMzxlGMMTBdpNOBBljUZ7loSBuo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KqogU8rjKuTeyQHh64GwCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Heraclius%20629&amp;f=false| author = Walter Emil Kaegi|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2003|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|187 }} The Persian succession between 628 and 632 becomes confused and different historians give different succession timelines.&lt;ref name = "sasanianTimes"/&gt;{{rp| 117}} In the period following the death of Kavadh II, up to six different individual are said to have reigned, these are [[Ardashir III]], [[Shahrbaraz]], [[Borandukht]], [[Shapur-i Shahrvaraz]], [[Azarmidokht]] and [[Farrukh Hormizd]]. Negations continued with Shahrbaraz being the real power. Antiochus records that Heraclius made an agreement with Ardashir III with Shahrbaraz acting as intermediary,&lt;ref name ="Emperor"/&gt;{{rp|187 }} [[Nikephoros I of Constantinople|Nikephoros]] gives a date of July 629 at Arabissos.&lt;ref name ="Emperor"/&gt;{{rp|185}} Walter Emil Kaegi sees this July 629 meeting as representing an earlier negotiation with Shahrbaraz preceding the death of Kavadh II.&lt;ref name ="Emperor"/&gt;{{rp|187 }} Nikephoros exaggerated and confused the record by claiming that Hormizd succeeded Kavadh II. Claiming Hormizd sent his son to Heraclius' court.&lt;ref name ="Emperor"/&gt;{{rp|185}}

Heraclius was in Constantinople in 629 where he issued a "novel", or law, that went into effect on 1 April 629.&lt;ref name ="Emperor"/&gt;{{rp|186}} At Arabissos Heraclius and Shahrbaraz would agree on new borders.&lt;ref name ="Emperor"/&gt;{{rp|188}} To seal the deal Shahrbaraz's son [[Niketas the Persian|Niketas]] and another of his brothers came to live at the Byzantine court, having been held for a time in central Mesopotamia practically as hostages. They arrived along with the True Cross. The Holy Sponge was attached to the cross in a special ceremony in Constantinople on 14 September 629. The Holy Lance followed reaching Constantinople on 28 October 629. It is probable that at this time, Niketas converted to Christianity; as he was his father's heir-apparent, this opened the prospect of the Christianization of Persia should Shahrbaraz be able to maintain his power there.&lt;ref name ="Emperor"/&gt;{{rp|188–189, 206}}

Heraclius would not have entered Jerusalem while the Persian troop presence persisted. Heraclius brother [[Theodore (brother of Heraclius)|Theodore]] had encounter resistance at Edessa and Heraclius would not have exposed himself to similar danger. Shahrbaraz had [[Ardashir III]] assassinated and took control of the Persian Empire from 27 April 630 to 9 June 630.&lt;ref name ="Emperor"/&gt;{{rp|185}} The 630 date would also have the advantage of matching the date for the Fast of Heraclius.&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aScNMZWlxYUC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=Egypt+jews+630&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lLMsU4DTDanlyQGliIGgBA&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Egypt%20jews%20630&amp;f=false |title=Arab Conquest of Egypt and the Last Thirty Years of the Roman Dominion |year=1902 |author=Alfred Joshua Butler |publisher=Clarendon Press |page=134 |accessdate= 21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discourse===
====Reconciliation attempts====
Heraclius came as victor into the country and the Jews of Tiberias and Nazareth, under the leadership of Benjamin of Tiberias, surrendered and asked for his protection. It is said that Benjamin even accompanied Heraclius on his voyage to Jerusalem and Benjamin was persuaded to convert, Benjamin obtained a general pardon for himself and the Jews.&lt;ref name="Palestine in Late Antiquity"/&gt; He was baptized in [[Nablus]] in the house of Eustathios, an influential Christian. However once Heraclius reached Jerusalem he was persuaded to go back on his promise to Benjamin of Tiberias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=imcpl1111&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R5&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=6&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX2587502507&amp;&amp;docId=GALE | title = Encyclopedia Judaica - Benjamin of Tiberias |date = 2007 |editors= Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik.

====Conversion policy of Heraclius====
In 628, Heraclius reportedly rescinded a decision made by his brother which would have exterminated the Jews of Edessa for supporting the Persians. Robert Bonfil suggests that Heraclius’ change of heart in 630 cannot be separated from the "Jewish Question" and the anti-Jewish world view ubiquitous to Christian thought at that time. He sees the decision as being based more on politics than religion.&lt;ref name = "Dialectics"/&gt;{{rp| 81–84 }} Heraclius is one of the few Byzantine emperors to have had an imperial conversion campaign. The rarity of such campaigns is thought to be due to Christian theological constraints. In Christian apocalyptic literature, some Jews must remain until the end of time.&lt;ref name = "Dialectics"/&gt;{{rp| 878 }} Christian theologians of the time also had other core theological reasons for rejecting the forced conversion of Jews.&lt;ref name = "Dialectics"/&gt;{{rp| 84–85}}

In another legend, Heraclius' astrologers are said to have revealed to him that a circumcised people would conquer his empire.&lt;ref name ="Kaegi"&gt;{{cite book |title= Heraclius, Emperor of Byzantium|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=Heraclius+massacre+Galilee&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uMzJVLGcM8WbNvTTgdgI&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Heraclius%20massacre%20Galilee&amp;f=false| author = Walter Emil Kaegi| publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 2003|page = 194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heraclius set out to forcible convert the Jews of the Byzantine Empire, reportedly advising his friend Dagobert, king of the Franks, to do likewise.&lt;ref name="Psychoanalytic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HeracliusJC"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3877-byzantine-expire#anchor6 |encyclopedia=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |title=Byzantine Empire: Heraclius |publisher=Funk and Wagnalls |year=1906 |accessdate= 28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In apocalyptic literature==
The events of the Persian-Byzantine struggle in the Levant and the consequent Arab conquest inspired several apocalyptic Jewish writings of the early Middle Ages. Helping to popularize the idea of a war messiah, the [[Messiah ben Joseph]], who would die paving the way for the Messiah ben David.&lt;ref name = "Minora"/&gt;{{rp|168–171}}&lt;ref name="JVL messiah"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blidstein|first=Prof. Dr. Gerald J.|title=Messiah in Rabbinic Thought|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0014_0_13744.html|work=MESSIAH|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library and Encyclopaedia Judaica 2008 The Gale Group|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are the [[Apocalypse of Zerubbabel]], which is partially attributed to the events between the Persian conquest of [[Palaestina Prima|Palaestina]] and subsequent [[Muslim conquest of Syria]].&lt;ref name=silver&gt;{{cite book

The [[Tiburtine Sibyl]] records that the Jews of the Byzantine Empire would be converted in one hundred and twenty years, seeming to refer to these occurrences, since about one hundred and twenty years elapsed from the time of the Persian war under Anastasius, in 505, to the victory of Heraclius in 628.&lt;ref name="HeracliusJC"/&gt; Some scholars see similarities between these Christian works and their Jewish counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lrKRgCv2uE0C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Otot+ha-Ma%C5%A1iah&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZnakdJYa4U&amp;sig=KgxKwEIeJavQCn80gdo9CK2YuEs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xwaIVI3VBYWhNtDEgPAE&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Otot%20ha-Ma%C5%A1iah&amp;f=false | title = Judaism and Imperial Ideology in Late Antiquity | pages =55–58| author= Alexei Sivertsev | publisher =Cambridge University Press| year = 2011| accessdate = 17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nw-rR_Skb-cC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=Tiburtine+sibyl+Heraclius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mVfyVo_8j9&amp;sig=qX4UeZd0m6g7_Bv6tZOqPoxdZd4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Rb3KVPKTO8qmgwTwxYHIBg&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tiburtine%20sibyl%20Heraclius&amp;f=false| title = The Byzantine Apocalyptic Tradition| pages =180–181| author= Paul Julius Alexander| publisher = University of California Press| year = 1985| accessdate = 29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following the defeat of the Persian Empire the territory would not remain in Byzantine hands for long. By 638, the Arabs would conquer Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c788wWR_bLwC&amp;pg=PA525&amp;dq=arab+638+jerusalem&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bQhyVePyD4ORsAXVmIOQDQ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=arab%20638%20jerusalem&amp;f=false| title = Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World| authors = Glen Warren Bowersock, Peter Brown, Oleg Grabar|publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1999|page =525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caesarea would remain under Byzantine control until 640.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pckUkJIHjiQC&amp;pg=PA628&amp;dq=Caesarea+Maritima+Persians&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3fEsU_GGGuWsyAHhuYHgAw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=614&amp;f=false| title = Caesarea Maritima: A Retrospective After Two Millennia |editors= Avnēr Rabbān, Kenneth G. Holum|publisher = BRILL| year = 1996|page =187| accessdate= 21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab Islamic Empire under Caliph [[Umar]] conquered the lands of [[Mesopotamia]], the Levant, and Egypt.

==Demographic impact==
Some historians believe the war reduced and weakened the Christian population not just in Jerusalem but across the Near East, allowing the success of the following Arab invasion. However, over the past thirty years the archaeological evidence has not supported the ancient manuscripts which record the devastation of the Christian community in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Written"/&gt;{{rp| 353}}

Jerusalem is said to have been burnt down. However, neither wide spread burning nor destruction of churches have been found in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name=bibleinterp.com /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Phoenicia"/&gt; 
Despite the claims of large scale destruction, the archaeological evidence does not reveal layers of destruction associated with the Persian conquest.&lt;ref name="bibleinterp.com"/&gt; There was also no hard evidence found for the widespread destruction of churches.&lt;ref name=bibleinterp.com /&gt;

A significant number of burial sites were allocated according to Strategius. A mass burial grave at [[Mamilla]] cave was discovered in 1989 by Israeli [[archeologist]] [[Ronny Reich]], near the site where Strategius recorded the massacre took place. The human remains were in poor condition containing a minimum of 526 individuals.&lt;ref name="antiquities.org.il"/&gt; Other mass burial sites have also been found although they cannot be accurately dated to the Persian conquest of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="bibleinterp.com"/&gt; Yet, excavations of Jerusalem show a continuous habitation in Jerusalem neighborhoods and essentially little impact of population during the period of Persian governorship. As stated by archaeologist Gideon Avni:

:''... all excavated sites in Jerusalem show a clear pattern of continuity, with no evidence for destruction by the Persian conquest of 614 or the Arab conquest of 636.''&lt;ref name=bibleinterp.com /&gt;

Demographic continuity might have resulted from population exchange by the victorious Jewish rebels, but apparently also the Christian habitation remained relatively constant, despite the disturbance by the Persian conquest, and no significant impact on the population of Jerusalem was made during the following period of Sassanid dominance.&lt;ref name=bibleinterp.com /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6126">The '''Left Column''' (German: ''Kolonne Links'') was an [[agitprop]] theater troupe during the 1920s and 1930s. The troupe worked in support of the [[Workers International Relief]] (WIR). During the Nazi era, some of the group went into exile in the Soviet Union, where some of the members were arrested by the [[NKVD|Soviet secret police]] in the [[Great Purge]] and in connection with the [[Hitler Youth Conspiracy]].

== History ==
In its early years, the group consisted of nine people, none of whom had any theatrical training, a pianist and a driver. The [[Berlin]] troupe&lt;ref&gt;C.D.

Retrieved November 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the most highly praised agitprop troupes in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Ewan MacColl, [http://www.wcml.org.uk/contents/activists/ewan-maccoll/theatre/theatre-of-action/#pagetop "Theatre of Action"] Working Class Movement Library. Retrieved November 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; despite its lack of training.

Hans Hauska joined the troupe in late summer 1930.&lt;ref name="phelps"&gt;Thomas Phelps, [http://www.uni-giessen.de/~g51092/LinkswodasHerz.html "Links wo das Herz ist"] Justus Liebig University Giessen (October 27–28, 1997). Retrieved November 29, 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, the Left Column were rewarded with a tour in the [[Soviet Union]] for five weeks for having gained 16,000 new members for the WIR.&lt;ref name="phelps" /&gt; On their return, they discovered that several of their performances in Germany were cancelled because a March 28, 1931 decree from the [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|Reichspräsident]] to combat violence led to a local prohibition against agitprop theater assemblies.&lt;ref name="phelps" /&gt; Six members then left Germany, embarking on a 4-month trip by boat and train across [[Siberia]] back to Moscow.&lt;ref name="phelps" /&gt; In 1933, under [[Gustav von Wangenheim]]'s leadership, they established the German Left Column Theater with members of "Troupe 31", another agitprop theater group.&lt;ref name="phelps" /&gt;

In 1935, troupe members [[Helmut Damerius]] and Bruno Schmidtsdorf, were in Wangenheim's 1935 anti-Nazi film, ''Kämpfer''. Schmidtsdorf played the lead role,&lt;ref name="hs-1"&gt;Hans Schafranek, [http://www.iwk-online.de/2001-1_schafranek.html "Kontingentierte 'Volksfeinde' und 'Agenturarbeit'"] Internationale wissenschaftliche Korrespondenz zur Geschichte der deutschen Arbeiterbewegung (January 2001). Retrieved November 26, 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritz Lemke, and Hauska wrote the music.

Beginning in 1935, the NKVD began arresting members of the troupe in the Great Purge.&lt;ref name="phelps-n39,40" /&gt; All those arrested were members who had arrived in Moscow after 1932. Arrested members included Hans Hauska on November 20, 1937.&lt;ref name="phelps-n39,40"&gt;Thomas Phelps (1997), [http://www.uni-giessen.de/~g51092/LinkswodasHerz.html See footnotes 39 and 40]&lt;/ref&gt; On February 5, 1938, Kurt Ahrendt, Karl Oefelein and Schmidtsdorf were arrested, charged with starting a branch of the [[Hitler Youth]], and were executed three weeks later.&lt;ref name="phelps-n39,40" /&gt; On March 17, 1938, Helmut Damerius, once a leader of the troupe, was arrested and sent to a [[gulag]] in [[Siberia]].

The '''Liverpool Playhouse''' is a theatre in [[Williamson Square]] in the city of [[Liverpool]], England.    It originated in 1866 as a [[music hall]], and in 1911 developed into a [[repertory]] theatre.  As such it nurtured the early careers of many actors and actresses, some of whom went on to achieve national and international reputations. Architectural changes have been made to the building over the years, the latest being in 1968 when a modern-style extension was added to the north of the theatre.  In 1999 a trust was formed, joining the management of the Playhouse with that of the [[Everyman Theatre, Liverpool|Everyman Theatre]].

==History==
The present theatre on the site was designed by Edward Davies, and opened in 1866.  It replaced an earlier theatre called the Star Concert Hall.  The present theatre was originally named the Star Music Hall.&lt;ref name=lloyd&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Liverpool/PlayhouseTheatreLiverpool.htm| title = Playhouse Theatre, Williamson Square, Liverpool F.C.| accessdate = 14 August 2011| publisher = Matthew Lloyd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 its name was changed to the Star Theatre of Varieties.  The theatre was improved in 1898 by Harry Percival with a new auditorium and foyer, and electricity was installed.&lt;ref name=lloyd/&gt; In 1911 the Liverpool Repertory Theatre Limited was established, with [[Basil Dean]] as its "controller and producer".  The company could not afford to build a new theatre, and bought the Star Theatre for £28,000 {{Inflation|UK|28000|1911|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}  This made it the first [[repertory]] in Britain to own the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] of a theatre.  The company spent a further £4,000 ({{Inflation|UK|4000|1911|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) on redesigning and modernising the theatre.&lt;ref name=iles&gt;{{Citation| last = Iles| first = Paul| title = Green Room versus Board Room: Liverpool Playhouse and Business Modelling for Resident Theatres| publisher = The Laughing Audience| url = http://www.laughingaudience.co.uk/business_models.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090304170514/http://www.laughingaudience.co.uk/business_models.html| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 4 March 2009| accessdate = 14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The auditorium and the basement foyer were redesigned by Stanley Adshead, the Professor of Civic Design at the Liverpool School of Architecture.&lt;ref name=pev&gt;{{Citation | last =Pollard| first =Richard | last2 = Pevsner | first2 = Nikolaus | author2-link =Nikolaus Pevsner| series= The Buildings of England|title =Lancashire: Liverpool and the South-West | publisher =[[Yale University Press]] | year =2006 | location =New Haven and London | page = 301| isbn =0-300-10910-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was for many years managed by [[Maud Carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarsfieldmemorialsliverpool.co.uk/memorial-maud-farrington-nee-carpenter/|title=Memorial to Maud Farrington nee Carpenter|publisher=Sarsfieldmemorialsliverpool.co.uk|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was renamed the Liverpool Repertory Theatre,&lt;ref name=lloyd/&gt; and in 1916 renamed again, as the Liverpool Playhouse.&lt;ref name=iles/&gt; Minor structural alterations were made to the theatre in 1961 and in 1966.&lt;ref name=lloyd/&gt; In 1968 a modern-style extension was added to the north of the theatre to accommodate new foyers, bars, dressing rooms and a workshop.&lt;ref name=pev/&gt; In the 1990s the theatre company went into liquidation.&lt;ref name=iles/&gt; In 1999 the Liverpool and Merseyside Theatres Trust Limited was established as a charity, and the theatre re-opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1081229&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0| title = Liverpool and Merseyside Theatres Trust Ltd| accessdate = 14 August 2011| publisher = [[Charity Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is managed jointly with the [[Everyman Theatre, Liverpool|Everyman Theatre]] by [[Liverpool City Council]].&lt;ref name=pye&gt;{{Citation | last = Pye| first = Ken| year = 2011| title = Discover Liverpool| publication-place = Liverpool| publisher = Trinity Mirror Media| page = 66| isbn = 978-1-906802-90-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistes==
As a repertory company, the theatre has been involved in the careers of actors and actresses who have later achieved wide fame.  [[Noël Coward]] and [[Gertrude Lawrence]] worked with the company as child actors.  Other artistes who gained experience at the theatre include [[Robert Donat]], [[Lilian Braithwaite]], [[Cecil Parker]], [[John Gregson]], [[Clive Brook]], [[C. Aubrey Smith]], [[Richard Burton]], [[Michael Redgrave]], [[Diana Wynyard]], [[Rex Harrison]], [[Patricia Routledge]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], and [[Richard Briers]].&lt;ref name=pye/&gt;

==Architecture==
===Older section===
The exterior of the older part of the theatre is [[stucco]]ed, and it has a [[slate]] roof.  Its entrance front faces Williamson Square.  It has seven [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and is in three storeys.  The central three bays project forward and are surmounted by a broken [[pediment]].  On the ground floor the central bays contain three entrances, separated by pillars, which lead to a recessed porch.  Over each entrance is an [[architrave]] containing a [[fanlight]].  The lateral bays contain two round-headed and one flat-headed entrance on each side, over which are three blind round windows. In the middle storey, the bays are separated by [[pilaster]]s.  The three central bays each have a [[baluster|balustrade]] and a window with a [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] containing a roundel.  Each of the three lateral bays contains a window with a [[cornice]], and a round window above it.  Along the top storey are [[Oculus|oculi]] between panelled pilasters.  On the summit of each of the two lateral bays is a [[cupola]] on a short [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] [[colonnade]].  Inside the older part of the theatre are two balconies supported by [[cast iron]] columns.  The interior is decorated in [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] style.&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1218642|desc= Playhouse Theatre, Liverpool F.C.|accessdate= 20 August 2013|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newer section===
The newer section is constructed in concrete, and largely faced by glass.  On the ground floor are entrance doors.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt; Above this, the building is based around three cylinders.  The largest of these starts at the first floor and rises through two storeys.  It is [[cantilever]]ed from a central column.  To the left is a smaller cylinder, cantilevered from a separate column, interlocking with the larger cylinder.  Inside the whole is a hollow column containing the stairs.&lt;ref name=pev/&gt;

===Assessment and critique===
The theatre is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II* [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]], having been designated on 14 March 1975.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt; In its description, the list quotes the ''[[Architects' Journal]]'' of 1968 which says of the older section that it is "significant as an early and rare work by one of the pioneers of the Liverpool School of Architecture, in the Grecian style favoured by the school at that date", and of the newer section that it is "a brilliant concept, joyously realised, which exploits asymmetrical volumes and ever varying spaces yet achieves unity and also balance with the adjoining [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] façade".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = 4 December 1968| title = | periodical = [[Architects' Journal]]| page = 1327}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of England]]'' series the architectural historians Richard Pollard and [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] say of the newer section that it is "a spectacular composition" which creates an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation, exactly right for a theatre foyer".&lt;ref name=pev/&gt;

The '''Mikhailovsky Theatre''' ({{lang-ru|Миха́йловский теа́тр}}) is one of [[Russia]]'s oldest [[opera]] and [[ballet]] houses. It was founded in 1833 and is situated in a historical building on 1, [[Arts Square (Saint Petersburg)|Arts Square]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. It is named after [[Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich of Russia]].

== History ==
=== Before 1917 ===
The theatre was established in 1833 by decree of Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].

Before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917 Revolution]], the Mikhailovsky did not have its own resident company. Performances were given either by a French company, hired by the Russian Imperial Theatres, or at the end of the century by the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] and [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]] companies. Most of the great French actors of the period performed at the theatre, including [[Jeanne Sylvanie Arnould-Plessy]], [[Rachel Félix]], [[Lucien Guitry]] and [[Sarah Bernhardt]], as well as singers such as [[Hortense Schneider]]. Both classical and contemporary authors and composers had their works produced to great acclaim in French. Plays by [[Molière]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Victorien Sardou]], and  [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]] and [[operettas]] by [[Jacques Offenbach]] were praised by the intelligentsia and the Russian aristocracy, such as [[Tolstoy]] and [[Tchaikovsky]].

When the [[Bolshevik]]s took power the French company was forced to leave Russia, and in 1917 the Mikhailovsky Theatre was closed.

=== Communist era ===

On March 6, 1918 the theatre was reopened as an opera theatre. Shortly afterwards the Mikhailovsky started changing its names: in 1918–20 it was called the Ex-Mikhailovsky Theatre, in 1920 it was renamed to the State Academic Comic Opera Theatre, in 1921 the theatre changed its name to the Maly Operny Teatr (Maly Opera Theatre), in 1926 it got the name of the Leningrad State Academic Maly Opera Theatre, MALEGOT for short. New management and artists followed. From 1920 to 1930 the Maly Operny Teatr established itself as one of the leading experimental stages in Russian new [[musical theatre]]. [[Shostakovich]] made his debut at the Maly Operny: [[Samuil Samosud]] conducted world premiere performances of his ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' and ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', the famous [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] production of ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' was staged there, and the [[world premiere]] of [[Prokofiev]]'s epic opera ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]'' took place on the theatre's stage on June 12, 1946.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

=== 1930: Creation of the Ballet Company ===

In 1930s Russian choreographer [[Fyodor Lopukhov]] founded the ballet company of the Theatre. The first ballet premiere, ''[[Les millions d'Arlequin|Harlequinade]]'', choreographed by Lopukhov, took place on June 6, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citywalls.ru/house826.html?s=nhu3hgcosjoabru2p062mosrj6 |title=Михайловский театр - Театр Оперы и балета им.

=== The 2000s revival ===

From 1989 to 2007, the theatre bore the name of [[Modest Mussorgsky]], subsequently returning to its original name the Mikhailovsky Theatre.&lt;ref name=official&gt;[http://www.mikhailovsky.ru/theatre/ History of the Mikhaylovsky Theatre], official site. Retrieved 10 August 2008. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, in what was seen as a controversial move, Russian businessman [[Vladimir Kekhman]] was appointed as General Director of the theatre. Vladimir Kekhman's strategy was to spend prolific amounts of money on ballet stars to build the Theatre's popularity.&lt;ref name="independent 6263239"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-is-rocked-by-a-bolshoi-revolution-6263239.html|title=Russia is rocked by a Bolshoi revolution|website=Independent.co.uk|date=17 November 2011|author=Shaun Walker|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He built a business-based organizational structures to the Ballet, donated 1 billion [[rouble]]s ($40m US) for renovation of the building, and invited [[Elena Obraztsova]] and [[Farouk Ruzimatov]] to coordinate the artistic revival of the Mikhailovsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/01/mikhailovsky-ballet-bolshoi|title=Who’s pulling the strings in Russia’s Ballet Revolution?|website=Theguardian.com|date=1 January 2012|author=Luke Jennings|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Elena Obraztsova was appointed Artistic Director of the Mikhailovsky Opera and Farouk Ruzimatov became Artistic Director of the Mikhailovsky Ballet. However, Obraztsova resigned in 2008 and Ruzimatov in 2009. From 2009 both Obraztsova and Ruzimatov held a seat on the Artistic Committee of the Theatre.

The ballet company of the Mikhailovsky Theatre made its London debut in July 2008 in [[London Coliseum]] arranged by the British ex-dancer [[Gavin Roebuck]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. This season helped bring the company international recognition and led to a nomination for the Best Foreign Dance Company Award at the National Dance Awards in 2008, though Mikhailovsky lost out to the [[New York City Ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaldanceawards.com/dance2008/foreign_dance.htm |title=National Dance Awards Best Foreign Dance Company |website=Nationaldanceawards.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, [[Mikhail Messerer]] was appointed Ballet Master in Chief of the Theater. For the Mikhailovsky, Messerer staged numerous ballets, including ''[[Swan Lake]]'', ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'', ''[[Flames of Paris]]'', ''[[Laurencia (ballet)|Laurencia]]'', ''[[Cinderella]]'' and ''[[Le Corsaire]]''. In 2009 - 2011 Peter Feranec was the Theatre's Musical Director.  [[Mikhail Tatarnikov]] began his tenure as the Theatre’s musical director in 2012 (he resigned in October 2018).   The Mikhailovsky Ballet returned to London in 2010, again arranged with Gavin Roebuck{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}.
 
From 2011 till 2013 [[Nacho Duato]] worked as the Mikhailovsky Ballet's Artistic Director, with Messerer as the Theatre's Ballet Master in Chief. Several of Duato ballets received their world premieres at the Mikhailovsky.

Under Mikhail Messerer's leadership the Mikhailovsky Ballet has won the Best Ballet Company award by the British Critics' Circle for it's 3rd London season in 2013. 
Also in 2013, the Mikhailovsky Opera made its debut at the Savonlinna Opera Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operafestival.fi/news/Mikhailovsky-Theatre-to-perform-Eugene-Onegin-and--Un-ballo-in-maschera-at-the-Savonlinna-Opera-Festival/3qe3bat3/77d5f26e-4801-4cf9-9409-01c3006d872b |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109134630/http://www.operafestival.fi/news/Mikhailovsky-Theatre-to-perform-Eugene-Onegin-and--Un-ballo-in-maschera-at-the-Savonlinna-Opera-Festival/3qe3bat3/77d5f26e-4801-4cf9-9409-01c3006d872b |archivedate=2013-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in November 2014, the Mikhailovsky Ballet debuted in the US at New York's [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]].

In October 2012, Vladimir Kekhman was declared bankrupt at London's High Court of Justice, but he assured that the operation of the Mikhailovsky Theatre was not at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theartsdesk.com/dance/bankruptcy-wont-stop-ballet-0|title=Bankruptcy won't stop the ballet|website=Theartdesk.com|date=28 January 2013|author=Ismene Brown|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, top ballet dancer [[Natalia Osipova]] left the company to join [[The Royal Ballet]] in London, after she had made the headlines in December 2011 for choosing the Mikhailosky Theatre over the [[Bolshoi Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/dance/9981660/Natalia-Osipova-to-leave-Russia-for-London-principal-dancer-role.html|title=Natalia Osipova to leave Russia for London principal dancer role|website=Telegraph.co.uk|date=9 April 2013|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent 6263239"/&gt;

In December 2013, Altynai Asylmuratova became Adviser to General Director of the Theatre (she resigned in March 2014). In 2013 Vasily Barkhatov was appointed Artistic Director of the Mikhailovsky Opera (he resigned in 2014). In 2014 Vasily Petrenko became the Theatre's Principal Guest Conductor (he resigned in 2015).
In 2015, the tenor [[Neil Shicoff]] was appointed Chief of the Mikhailovsky Opera,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2015/5/News/Shicoff_Chief_of_Opera_Mikhailovsky_Theatre.html|title=St. Petersburg’s Mikhailovsky Theatre Appoints Tenor Neil Shicoff as Company's Chief of Opera|website=Operanews.com|date=5 May 2015|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and from July 2017 till July 2018, the bass Paata Burchuladze was the Chief of the Mikhailovsky Opera.

Mikhail Messerer resigned from the Theatre in September 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5003">'''Monterey Car Week''' is a week in August in which a number of car-related events are held in and around [[Monterey, California]].

==Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance==
{{main|Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance}}
The Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance is held on the final Sunday of Monterey Car Week. It is a car show showing the most elegant and notable vehicles in the world. The proceeds of the show support charities.

==Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion==
{{main|Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion}}
The Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion, formerly known as the Monterey Historics until 2010, is held the final weekend of Monterey Car Week at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca]]. The four-day event has over 500 participants, and generally features a specific marque every year. The Monterey Pre-Reunion is a two-day event held the previous Saturday and Sunday.

==Auctions==
Automobile auctions of classic cars are held at various times and locations on the Monterey Peninsula. They are held by auction houses such as [[Bonhams]], [[RM Auctions]], [[Russo and Steele]], [[Gooding &amp; Company]], Mecum Auctions, and Rick Cole Auctions. Total sales in 2014 were $463,744,226, with the high sale being a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO berlinetta for $38,115,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piff|first1=Tony|title=Defying All Predictions|journal=[[Sports Car Market]]|date=November 2014|volume=26|issue=11|pages=94-96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jet Center Party==
The Jet Center Party, formally called the Motorworks Revival, is an invitation-only event held at the Monterey Jet Center the Wednesday before the Pebble Beach Concours. It is considered the unofficial kick-off for the week. It is hosted by [[Gordon McCall]]. Both exotic cars and private jets are displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bomstead|first1=Carl|title=Flying High Without Leaving the Ground|journal=[[Sports Car Market]]|date=November 2014|volume=26|issue=11|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends of the Autobahn==
The Legends of the Autobahn show features German automobiles. It began as a [[BMW Car Club of America]] event and grew to include all German cars. It formerly showed Porsches also, but a separate event, the Porsche Werks Reunion, for Porsches was established in 2014. This event is free to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=B. Mitchell|title=Legend Rolls On|journal=[[Sports Car Market]]|date=November 2014|volume=26|issue=11|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held at the Nicklaus Club - Monterey golf club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Erik|title=German Metal! 2014 Legends of the Autobahn Concours|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/german-metal-2014-legends-of-the-autobahn-concours-mega-gallery/|website=caranddriver.com|publisher=[[Car and Driver]]|accessdate=January 9, 2015|date=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Porsche Werks Reunion==
The Porsche Werks Reunion event features Porsches and was established in 2014 after splitting off from the Legends of the Autobahn show. There were 519 cars on display at the initial event. This event was started by the [[Porsche Club of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Prescott|title=Inaugural Werks Reunion: A Porsche Paradise|journal=[[Sports Car Market]]|date=November 2014|volume=26|issue=11|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held at the Rancho Canada Golf Club in Carmel Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ely|first1=Trevor|title=Porsche Werks Reunion 2014 – Report and Photos|url=http://www.sportscardigest.com/porsche-werks-reunion-2014-report-photos/|publisher=Sports Car Digest|accessdate=January 9, 2014|date=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering==
The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering (usually shortened to The Quail) is a car show limited to 200 automobiles located at the Quail Lodge &amp; Golf Club.

'''Rachel Jane Nickell''' (23 November 1968 – 15 July 1992) was a British woman who was murdered on [[Wimbledon Common]], in South-West [[London]] on 15 July 1992. The subsequent initial police investigation of the crime resulted in the arrest in controversial circumstances of an innocent man, who was subsequently acquitted. The perpetrator of the murder was successfully identified by a later police investigation, which secured a conviction in 2008. 

Nickell was walking with her young child on Wimbledon Common when she was attacked and murdered by an assailant at that time unknown. A lengthy police investigation to find the perpetrator followed, during which a wrong suspect was charged and acquitted before the case [[Cold case (criminology)|went cold]]. 

In 2002, with more advanced [[forensic]] techniques, [[Scotland Yard]] reopened the case, and on 18 December 2008 [[Robert Napper]] pleaded guilty to Nickell's [[manslaughter]] on the grounds of [[diminished responsibility]]. Napper, who was already incarcerated for life at that time for a 1993 double-murder, was sentenced at a court trial to indefinite detention at [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor High Security hospital]] for the criminally insane.

==Murder==
At the time of her death, Nickell was living near [[Wimbledon Common]] with boyfriend André Hanscombe, and their son, Alexander Louis, who was born in 1989.&lt;ref name=alex-born&gt;{{cite book
| title = Index to Births
| publisher = General Record Office
| year = 1989
| location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nickell at the time of her death was a 23 year old full-time mother. On the morning of 15 July 1992, she and her then two-year-old son, were walking with the family's dog on Wimbledon Common. Whilst passing through a secluded area of the common Nickell was attacked by an assailant who sexually assaulted her and murdered her by repeatedly stabbing and slashing her with a knife, who afterwards fled the scene, leaving Alexander left physically unharmed in the near vicinity. A passer-by subsequently found Alexander clinging to his mother's body repeating the words, "Wake up, Mummy".

==Investigation==
Officers of the [[Metropolitan Police]] undertook the investigation, under pressure to find the perpetrator from public outrage at the circumstances of the murder and press coverage. Although 32 men were eventually questioned in connection with the murder, the investigation quickly targeted Colin Stagg, an unemployed man from [[Roehampton]] who was known to walk his dog on the Common. As there was no forensic evidence linking Stagg to the scene, the police asked a [[Criminal psychology|criminal psychologist]] to create an [[Offender profiling|offender profile]] of the killer. They decided that Stagg fitted the profile and asked the psychologist to assist with designing a covert operation, code-named "Operation Ezdell", to see whether Stagg would eliminate or implicate himself. This operation was later criticised by the media and Stagg's trial judge, as in effect a "[[Sting operation|honeytrap]]".

===Operation Ezdell===
An [[undercover]] policewoman from the [[Metropolitan Police]]'s Special Operations Group ([[SO10]]) contacted Stagg, posing as a friend of a woman with whom he used to be in contact via a lonely hearts' column. Over a period of five months, she attempted to obtain information from him by feigning a romantic interest, meeting him, speaking to him on the telephone and exchanging letters containing sexual fantasies. During a meeting in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], they spoke about the Nickell murder, but Stagg later claimed that he had only played along with the topic because he wanted to pursue the romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,,1803083,00.html | title = Police quiz new suspect in Wimbledon Common murder case | work = Guardian Unlimited | location=London | first=Duncan | last=Campbell | date=22 June 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Profiler Paul Britton later said that he disagreed with use of the fantasy-filled letters and knew nothing of them until after they had been sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20041114/ai_n12763174 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070123154105/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20041114/ai_n12763174 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-01-23 | title = Police ignored clues that could have led to Rachel Nickell's killer | work =  The Independent on Sunday | publisher = Find Articles at BNET.com }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The undercover female police officer won Stagg's confidence and drew out his violent fantasies, but Stagg did not admit to the murder. Police released a taped conversation between the police-officer and Stagg in which she claimed to enjoy hurting people, to which Stagg mumbled: "Please explain, as I live a quiet life. If I have disappointed you, please don't dump me. Nothing like this has happened to me before." When she went on to say, "If only you had done the Wimbledon Common murder, if only you had killed her, it would be all right," Stagg replied: "I'm terribly sorry, but I haven't."&lt;ref name=Cohen-25Jun2006&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1805414,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=With police and tabloids in cahoots, Colin Stagg became a sacrificial lamb | first=Nick | last=Cohen | date=25 June 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing, on the advice of the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], that there was sufficient evidence to secure a conviction of Stagg in a court trial for the Nickell murder, police arrested and charged him on 17 August 1993 with Nickell's murder.

===Trial===
When the case reached the [[Old Bailey]], [[Mr Justice Ognall]] ruled that the police had shown "excessive zeal" and had tried to incriminate a suspect by "deceptive conduct of the grossest kind". He excluded the entrapment evidence and the prosecution withdrew its case. Stagg was formally acquitted in September 1994.

==Reinvestigation and conviction==
===Cold case review===
Scotland Yard annually came under pressure for progress on the anniversary of the murder. Under new management, they began to collate evidence and files related to the case from 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo000403/text/00403w29.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 3 Apr 2000 (pt 29) |publisher=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, ten years after the murder, Scotland Yard used a cold case review team, which used refined [[DNA]] techniques only recently made available. A small team of officers and retired veteran investigators analysed statements from witnesses, reassessed files on a number of potential suspects, and examined the possibility that the case was linked to other crimes. Officers compared the injuries suffered by Nickell with other attacks and consulted forensic scientists about improvements in DNA matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2236230,00.html |work=The Times |location=London |title=DNA profiling and the case that started it all |date=21 June 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524073409/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C2-2236230%2C00.html |archivedate=24 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2003, reports surfaced that, after 18 months of tests on Nickell's clothes, police had found a male DNA sample which did not match her boyfriend or son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/09/07/nrach07.xml |title=The Daily Telegraph homepage |location=London |accessdate=25 November 2010 |first=Charles |last=Moore |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108145337/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2003%2F09%2F07%2Fnrach07.xml |archivedate=8 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sample at the time was insufficient to confirm an identity, but was large enough to rule out suspects.

===Robert Napper===
{{Main|Robert Napper}}
In July 2006, the Scotland Yard team interviewed convicted murderer Robert Napper for two days at [[Broadmoor Hospital]] in [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.epochtimes.com/news/6-6-21/43044.html |newspaper=The Epoch Times |title=Man Questioned over Rachel Nickell Murder |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929150021/http://en.epochtimes.com/news/6-6-21/43044.html |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Napper, 40 years of age at that time, had been diagnosed as having [[Schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenia]] and [[Asperger syndrome]]&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |author=Sean O'Neill and Adam Fresco |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5365060.ece |title=Inside the mind of Robert Napper |newspaper=The Times |date= 18 December 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and had been held at the secure institution for more than ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,29389-2236041,00.html | work=The Times | location=London | title=Broadmoor sex killer questioned over Nickell murder | first=Stewart | last=Tendler | date=21 June 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been convicted of the murder of Samantha Bisset and her four-year-old daughter Jazmine in November 1993, 16 months after Nickell's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20041114/ai_n12763174 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123154105/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20041114/ai_n12763174 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-01-23 |title=Police ignored clues that could have led to Rachel Nickell's killer |publisher= [[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]] |accessdate=}} &lt;/ref&gt;
On 28 November 2007, Napper was charged with Nickell's murder. He appeared at City of Westminster Magistrates' Court on 4 December 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7117564.stm |title=Man charged with Nickell murder |newspaper=BBC NEWS | date=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was remanded until another hearing on 20 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7126708.stm | work=BBC News | title=Nickell murder accused in court | date=4 December 2007 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January 2008, he pleaded not guilty to Nickell's murder, and faced a prosecution trial for the murder of Rachel Nickell in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7206302.stm |publisher=BBC NEWS |location=England, London |title= Man denies Rachel Nickell murder |date=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 December 2008, at the [[Old Bailey]], Napper pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Rachel Nickell on the grounds of [[diminished responsibility]].  Mr Justice Griffith Williams said that Napper would be held indefinitely at [[Broadmoor Hospital]] because he was "a very dangerous man". (At the same time, Colin Stagg received a public apology from the Metropolitan Police for their previous involvement and prosecution of him in regard the Nickell murder investigation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7783796.stm | title = Man admits 1992 Nickell killing | publisher = BBC | date=18 December 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/dec/18/rachel-nickell-robert-napper-murder-guilty|title=Rachel Nickell killing: Serial rapist Robert Napper pleads guilty|accessdate=6 October 2012 | location=London|work=The Guardian|first1=Sandra|last1=Laville|first2=Haroon|last2=Siddique|first3=Jenny|last3=Percival|first4=James|last4=Sturcke|date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
An internal review estimated that the pursuit of Stagg had cost the public £3&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article1094706.ece | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Police hunting killer of Rachel Nickell question inmate at Broadmoor | first=Jason | last=Bennetto | date=22 June 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202070258/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article1094706.ece | archivedate=2 December 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that vital scientific information had been missed. Stagg decided to sue the police for damages totalling £1&amp;nbsp;million following the 14 months he spent in custody. Stagg has co-written and published two books about the case, ''Who Really Killed Rachel?'' and, more recently, ''Pariah'' (with journalist Ted Hynds), the latter appearing on the same day as the real culprit Robert Napper's appearance in court to enter a plea.

An episode of the TV comedy series ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]'', entitled "[['S Out|Bottom's Out]]", due to be broadcast around the time of the murder, was postponed for two and a half years as it was set on Wimbledon Common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phill.co.uk/comedy/bottom/index.html |title=British TV Comedy |publisher=phill.co.uk |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The undercover female police officer involved in the attempt to obtain evidence against Stagg in the original investigation  by befriending him resigned from the Metropolitan Police force in 1998, taking early retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/111406.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rachel Nickell detective quits at 33 | date=12 June 1998 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of the [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]] she too sued the Metropolitan Police for damages arising from the investigation. In 2001, shortly before it was due to be heard, her case was settled out of court and she received £125,000. Her solicitor said: "The willingness of the Metropolitan Police to pay substantial damages must indicate their recognition that she sustained serious psychiatric injury."&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,,1803083,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Police quiz new suspect in Wimbledon Common murder case | first=Duncan | last=Campbell | date=22 June 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The payout was widely criticised by various sources, particularly as Nickell's son had been granted £22,000 (less than a fifth of the amount paid to the undercover detective) from the [[Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1263052.stm | work=BBC News | title=£125,000 for Rachel Nickell officer | date=6 April 2001 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal psychologist involved with the Stagg investigation was charged with professional misconduct by the [[British Psychological Society]] but, in 2002, in lieu of any substantive hearings, further action was dismissed due to the time delay in bringing proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article4397189.ece|title=Human rights lawyer Keir Starmer named as new prosecution service chief|work=[[The Times]]|date=26 July 2008|first=Frances|last=Gibb|accessdate=2008-08-04 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

André Hanscombe, Nickell's partner, later wrote a book titled ''The Last Thursday in July'', about his life with Nickell, coping with the murder and life with their son afterwards. In 1996 Hanscombe moved with their child to France, driven abroad, according to notes in his book, by media intrusion. "Callous, mercenary, unfeeling&amp;nbsp;... cowardly, snivelling scum" is how he described some of the reporters who tracked him and his son down to his "sanctuary" in the French countryside.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

In January 2007, the [[Home Office]] confirmed that Stagg would receive compensation for wrongful prosecution, with the amount to be set by an independent assessor. On 13 August 2008, Stagg's solicitor announced that the compensation, was £706,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Colin-Stagg-Man-Wrongly-Accused-Of-Killing-Rachel-Nickell-Receives-706000-Compensation/Article/200808215077425 | title = Colin Stagg To Get Compensation | date = 13 August 2008 | work = Sky News | dead-url = yes | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120201629/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Colin-Stagg-Man-Wrongly-Accused-Of-Killing-Rachel-Nickell-Receives-706000-Compensation/Article/200808215077425 |archive-date=20 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPCC findings===
Following an investigation, the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) released a report, dated 3 June 2010, into the actions of the Metropolitan Police Force and their handling of the murder investigation. It described a "catalogue of bad decisions and errors" by the Metropolitan Police which had resulted in Napper being free to kill Nickell. It said that officers missed a series of opportunities to take the violent psychopath off the streets and suggested the lives of Samantha Bisset and her four-year-old daughter Jazmine would also have been saved if police had acted on tip-offs, including one by Napper's mother.

Rachel Cerfontyne, of the IPCC, said that police failed to investigate the 1989 report that he attacked a woman on Plumstead Common, in London, and no record of the telephone call can be found. She said: "It is clear that throughout the investigations into the 'Green Chain' rapes and Rachel Nickell's death there was a catalogue of bad decisions and errors made by the Metropolitan Police. The police failed to sufficiently investigate after Napper's mother called police to report that he had confessed to her that he had raped a woman and, inconceivably, they eliminated Napper from inquiries into the Green Chain rapes because he was over 6ft tall. Without these errors, Robert Napper could have been off the streets before he killed Rachel Nickell and the Bissets, and before numerous women suffered violent sexual attacks at his hands." Detectives had decided to exclude anyone over 6' based on the description of a 5' 7" rapist, however there were conflicting witness reports of the rapist's height and Napper walked with a stoop. &lt;ref name="Telegraph-Missed-Oppurtunities"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3813201/Rachel-Nickell-The-missed-opportunities-to-catch-killer-Robert-Napper.html |title=Rachel Nickell: The missed opportunities to catch killer Robert Napper |last=Edwards |first=Richard |date=18 Dec 2008 |work=The Telgraph |access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Guardian-Missed-clues"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/dec/18/robert-napper-clues |title=Rachel Nickell case: Missed clues that allowed Robert Napper to kill again |last=Laville |first=Sandra |date=18 December 2008 |work=The Guardian |access-date=28 March 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC said no police officer would face disciplinary action because they have all retired, and one key senior detective had died.

'''''Ompax spatuloides''''' was a [[hoax]] fish "discovered" in Australia in August, 1872. Said to be poisonous, it could be found on some lists of Australian fishes through the 1930s.

'''Operation Yellowhammer''' is the codename for "no-deal" contingency planning by the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] in the event [[Brexit negotiations]] for the [[Withdrawal from the European Union|withdrawal]] from the European Union fail to reach an agreement or an extension by 29 March 2019.&lt;ref name="Ind20180906"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/operation-yellowhammer-brexit-photo-eu-rail-access-nodeal-secret-paper-latest-document-a8525506.html |title=Operation Yellowhammer: Photo of secret government no-deal Brexit papers reveals questions over 'rail access to the EU |date=6 September 2018 |newspaper=The Independent|url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Should there fail to be a negotiated settlement by 29 March 2019 then the UK would leave the [[European Union]], leaving a hiatus impacting many aspects of the relationship between the UK and European Union.  The areas impacted would include money, citizens, trade, customs, and regulations.&lt;ref name="BBC-nodeal-look"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39294904|title=Brexit: What would 'no deal' look like?|first=Chris|last=Morris|date=14 October 2017|access-date=6 September 2018|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2018 a press photographer captured a snapshot of a "no-deal" planning document revealing some details of then-current preparations and the [[HM Treasury]] codename for those plans.&lt;ref name="BBCsnatchPIC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Snatched pic gives insight into 'no deal' Brexit planning|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45410344|first=Laura|last=Kuenssberg|date=6 September 2018|access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document appeared to indicate the [[Civil Contingencies Secretariat]], a department of the [[Cabinet Office]] responsible for emergency planning, had been used in anticipation of government policy.&lt;ref name="Sky-FI1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/operation-yellowhammer-leaked-no-deal-brexit-details-are-quite-revealing-11491983|title=It's been another first for Brexit.|access-date=7 September 2018|first=Faisal|last=Islam|website=Sky}}&lt;/ref&gt; No further details were revealed.

'''Pipamazine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; trade names '''Mornidine''', '''Mometine''', '''Nausidol''') is a drug of the [[phenothiazine]] class formerly used as an [[antiemetic]]. It is chemically related to [[chlorpromazine]], but has negligible [[antipsychotic]] activity and produces few [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal side effects]].&lt;ref name=Frota&gt;{{cite book | author=Frota LH |title=Cinqüenta anos de medicamentos antipsicóticos em psiquiatria |edition=1st |language=Portuguese |isbn=85-903827-1-0 |location=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=UFRJ |year=2003 |pages=486 |url=http://www.medicina.ufrj.br/cursos/LH%20FROTA%20-%201%20Ed%20-%2050%20ANOS%20DE%20MEDICAMENTOS%20ANTIPSICOTICOS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipamazine was introduced to the U.S. market in 1959 by [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company]]. It was advertised for [[morning sickness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[No authors listed] |title=Now she can cook breakfast again... |journal=[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] |volume=81 |issue=1 |date=July 1959 |pages=59 |format=PDF |pmc=1830735|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1830735/pdf/canmedaj00808-0002.pdf}} Advertisement.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[postoperative nausea and vomiting]], and was claimed to reduce the need for postoperative [[analgesic|analgesia]].&lt;ref name=AnnSurg&gt;{{cite journal |author=[No authors listed] |title=Lessened postoperative vomiting with MORNIDINE |journal=[[Annals of Surgery]] |volume=151 |issue=4 |date=April 1960 |format=PDF |pmc=1613578|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1613578/pdf/annsurg01301-0002.pdf }} Advertisement.&lt;/ref&gt;
It was eventually withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1969, after reports of [[hepatotoxicity]] (liver injury).&lt;ref&gt;{{Federal Register|34|12051}}. July 17, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wysowski DK, Swartz L |title=Adverse drug event surveillance and drug withdrawals in the United States, 1969–2002: the importance of reporting suspected reactions |journal=[[Archives of Internal Medicine]] |volume=165 |issue=12 |pages=1363–9 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15983284 |doi=10.1001/archinte.165.12.1363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is very little published information on pipamazine; it is mostly absent from modern-day sources, apart from a few passing mentions in the pharmacological literature.&lt;ref name=Frota/&gt;

==Adverse effects==
Mornidine advertisements for postoperative recovery claimed "unusually low side effects".&lt;ref name=AnnSurg/&gt; However, contemporary comparative trials found that [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure) was a substantial concern when the drug was given at normal dosages for this indication; blood pressure reductions of up to 70&amp;nbsp;mmHg were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blatchford E |title=Studies of anti-emetic drugs: A comparative study of cyclizine (Marzine), pipamazine (Mornidine), trimethobenzamide (Tigan), and hyoscine |journal=Canadian Journal of Anesthesia |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=159–65 |date=March 1961 |doi=10.1007/BF03021345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reductions in dosage mitigated hypotension while maintaining antiemetic efficacy.

In his book ''The Creation of Psychopharmacology'', Irish psychiatrist [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]] states that the failure of pipamazine to perform as a neuroleptic and its negative side effect profile helped Searle lose interest in the antipsychotic sector, and contributed to the company's refusal to market [[haloperidol]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Healy D |chapter=Explorations in a new world |title=The creation of psychopharmacology |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=123–4 |isbn=0-674-01599-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Festival''' edition of the festival is also held in [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], [[India]] at the historical [[Chowmahalla Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Shrinivas Rao perform in Hyderabad|author= |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-19/music-events/31075202_1_hindustani-khayal-duo|newspaper= Times of India|date= |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was organised for the first time in Hyderabad in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Three-day Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Joshi Festival kicks off in city|author= |url= http://apnnews.com/2012/02/18/three-day-sawai-gandharva-bhimsen-joshi-festival-kicks-off-in-city/|newspaper= apnnews|date= |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is organised by Mohan Hemmadi and Abhijit Bhattacharjee. It was decided to make it an annual event in Hyderabad like the Pune edition, and possibly an all-night event.

==Controversy==
The festival started on a wrong note with police denying permission and the show on the first day had to be curtailed. And the police gave a limited permission till 10 p.m. in the night, making it difficult for artists to be accommodated well in stipulated time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Chaos at classical music festival|author= |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-19/news-and-interviews/31075224_1_organizers-cops-classical-music|newspaper= Times of India|date= |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Scooby-Doo! and Kiss: Rock and Roll Mystery''''' is a 2015 [[direct-to-DVD]] [[animation|animated]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[mystery film]], and the twenty-fifth entry in the direct-to-video series of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' films. It was released digitally on July 10, 2015, and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 21, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mercedes Milligan |url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/home-entertainment/scooby-doo-meets-kiss-in-rock-and-roll-mystery/ |title=Scooby-Doo Meets KISS in 'Rock and Roll Mystery' |publisher=Animation Magazine |date=2015-04-20 |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the last ''Scooby-Doo'' production featuring [[Mindy Cohn]] as [[Velma Dinkley]] since [[Kate Micucci]] would take over the role the same year.

==Plot==
[[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]], [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]], [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]], [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] and [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] travel to an amusement park called Kiss World to see [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] at their big [[Halloween]] concert and solve a mystery, mostly because Daphne has a crush on Starchild ([[Paul Stanley]]), much to Fred's jealousy. After Scooby and the gang arrive, security chief and former government defense employee Delilah Domino refuses to let them in, so they sneak in and are caught by Delilah. At that moment, Kiss arrives, and after the gang explains that they are there to help, they tell Delilah the kids are free to stay, to which she reluctantly agrees. The Demon ([[Gene Simmons]]) initially opposes to the idea due to Scooby accidentally spraying a water gun on him when he came to Shaggy and Scooby for a surprise visit but later relents. As the gang split up for clues, Shaggy and Scooby are chased by an entity; Kiss comes to their aid. They tell the gang that the entity is called the Crimson Witch, and she has been terrorizing the park for a while, and they need her to disappear before the concert.

A strange [[psychic|fortune teller]] named Chikara says that the witch is from an alternate universe called Kissteria and plans to use the Black Diamond that Kiss uses in their hit song "[[Detroit Rock City]]" to summon a monster called The Destroyer to conquer the Earth, which Velma finds hard to believe. In order to stop the Crimson Witch, the gang uses the diamond to lure the witch. However, the Crimson Witch chases them through a portal to Kissteria. She manages to steal the diamond and unleash The Destroyer, but the gang and Kiss arrive in a spaceship to stop the monster. The gang then return to Earth, where they wake up believing that the witch's gas caused them all to have a hallucination. They unmask the Crimson Witch as Delilah, who wished to sell the Black Diamond (needed for laser technology) to a competing defense company to as revenge against her former employers. 

Later, the Starchild kisses Daphne right in front of Fred. Daphne then gives Fred a kiss on the cheek, much to his delight. The Demon gives Shaggy and Scooby a smile. Shaggy and Scooby then see Kiss fly away with the black diamond. Shaggy asks Scooby if they should tell Velma about what they saw. However, Scooby suggests they do not, stating: "Why rock her world?"

The '''Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine''' required [[History of Bulgaria (1878–1946)|Bulgaria]] to cede various territories, after Bulgaria had been one of the [[Central Powers]] defeated in [[World War I]]. The [[treaty]] was signed on 27 November 1919 at [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=  |first=  |author-link= |year= 1921|editor-last=  |editor-first= |contribution= Treaty between the Principal Allied and Associated Powers and Bulgaria and Protocol, signed at Neuilly-sur-Seine at November 27, 1919 |title= Peace Treaties, Various Treaties and Agreements between the Allied and Associated Powers and Serb-Croat-Slovene State, Roumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Turkey, together with some other agreements signed by the Peace Conference at Paris and Saint-Germain-En-Laye, presented by Mr. Lodge, April 25, 1921 |edition= |publisher= 67th Congress, 1st Session, Senate, Document No. 7 |publication-date=1921|publication-place= Washington, Government Printing Office |pages= 47–162 |url=https://archive.org/stream/peacetreaties00alli#page/46/mode/2up |accessdate=2013-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=  |first=  |author-link= |year= 1920|editor-last=  |editor-first= |title= Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Bulgaria,and Protocol,  Neuilly-sur-Seine, November 27, 1919, printed by the order of Parliament |edition= |publisher= J. de Labroquerie Taché, printer to the King's Most Excellent Majesty |publication-date=1920 |publication-place= Ottawa |pages= |url=https://archive.org/stream/treatyofpeacebet00alliuoft#page/n3/mode/2up |accessdate=2013-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty required Bulgaria: 
*to cede [[Western Thrace]] to the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] (which awarded it to Greece at the [[San Remo conference]]) thereby cutting off Bulgaria's direct outlet to the [[Aegean Sea]]. A population exchange (not compulsory) followed between Bulgaria and Greece.
*to cede a further area of {{convert|2,563|km²|abbr=on}} on its western border with the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia).
*to return [[Dobruja]], which according to the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]] was partially ceded to Bulgaria and partially to the [[Central Powers]] (who later, on 25 September 1918, transferred this joint condominium to Bulgaria), to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], thus restoring the border set by the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)]].
*to reduce its army to 20,000 men.
*to pay reparations of £100 million.
*to recognize the existence of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

The signing ceremony was held in Neuilly's town hall (hôtel de ville).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ville-neuillysurseine.fr/1-13291-Son-histoire.php Neuilly-sur-Seine official site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212002741/http://www.ville-neuillysurseine.fr/1-13291-Son-histoire.php |date=2007-12-12 }} (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bulgaria, the results of the treaty are popularly known as the '''Second National Catastrophe'''. Bulgaria subsequently regained South Dobruja as a result of the [[Treaty of Craiova]]. During [[World War II]], together with [[Nazi Germany]], it temporarily reoccupied most of the other territories ceded under the treaty.

== Territories ceded to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes ==
Four minor regions (historiographically referred to by Bulgarians as the [[Western Outlands]]) had been part of Bulgaria from its inception as a principality in 1878, except for the region around [[Strumitsa]], which became part of Bulgaria in 1912. Bulgaria was internationally recognised as an independent country in 1908 and controlled these territories until 1919 when they were ceded to the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes under the Treaty of Neuilly. The cession of the region was partly a compensation for the occupation of the southern and eastern part of [[Serbia]] by Bulgarian troops between 1915 and 1918, and was partly motivated by strategic reasons. The old political boundary between Bulgaria and Serbia followed a chain of high mountain ridges, whereas the new one gave significant military and strategic advantages to the Serbs: it dangerously exposed the Bulgarian capital of [[Sofia]] and significantly reduced the military threat to eastern Serbia in case of a Bulgarian invasion (see also [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]]).

The Treaty of Neuilly was one of the series of treaties after World War I, which included the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]], the [[Treaty of Trianon]], and the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], which were intended to diminish the military and political strength of the defeated members of the [[Central Powers]]. Some areas with a Bulgarian majority population{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} (such as [[Bosilegrad]] and part of the [[Dimitrovgrad, Serbia|Dimitrovgrad]] municipality) were ceded to Serbia (part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes).

Bulgarian sources claim{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that the treaty was intended to last for twenty years and that all the ceded territories should have been returned to Bulgaria in 1939, but that was not specified in the treaty.

Territories ceded by the treaty to the then [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] cover an area of {{convert|1,545|km²|abbr=on}} in what is now [[Serbia]] and {{convert|1,028|km²|abbr=on}} in what is now the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

In Serbia, to which the term generally applies in Bulgaria, the territory ceded is split between the modern Serbian [[Pirot District|District of Pirot]] (municipality of [[Dimitrovgrad, Serbia|Dimitrovgrad]] and smaller parts of the municipalities of [[Pirot]] and [[Babušnica]]) and [[Pčinja District|District of Pčinja]] (municipality of [[Bosilegrad]] and a small part of the municipality of [[Surdulica]]). It also includes a small section along the [[Timok River]] in the municipality and [[Zaječar District|District of Zaječar]], composed by eight localities (seven populated by [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]] and one populated by Bulgarians).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celedouatribalii.blogspot.com/ Tribalia (Blogger)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, the area corresponded to the following parts of the Bulgarian ''[[okrug]]s'': [[Kyustendil]], {{convert|661|km²|abbr=on}}, [[Tzaribrod]] {{convert|418|km²|abbr=on}}, [[Tran, Bulgaria|Tran]] {{convert|278|km²|abbr=on}}, [[Kula, Bulgaria|Kula]] {{convert|172|km²|abbr=on}} and [[Vidin]] {{convert|17|km²|abbr=on}}. Bulgarian sources claim that the Bulgarian population made 98% of the population in [[Bosilegrad]] and 95% of the population in Tzaribrod at the time. In the [[Yugoslav census of 1931]], all [[South Slavs]] were simply counted as [[Yugoslavs]] (Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Bulgarians) so a comparison could not be made. According to the last Census in Serbia from 2002, Bulgarians made 50% and 71% of population in [[Dimitrovgrad, Serbia|Dimitrovgrad]] and Bosilegrad respectively.

The '''United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict''', also known as the '''Goldstone Report''', was a team established in April 2009 pursuant to Resolution A/HRC/RES/S-9/1 of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC) of 12 January 2009, following the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] as an independent international fact-finding mission "to investigate all violations of [[international human rights law]] and [[international humanitarian law]] by the occupying Power, Israel, against the Palestinian people throughout the [[Occupied Palestinian Territory]], particularly in the occupied [[Gaza Strip]], due to the current aggression".&lt;ref name="resolutions-9/1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=resolution&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/A-HRC-S-9-2.doc Report of the Human Rights Council on its Ninth Special Session] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706073754/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/A-HRC-S-9-2.doc |date=6 July 2010 }}, UNHCR, 27 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; South African jurist [[Richard Goldstone]] was appointed to head the mission.&lt;ref name=resolution/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNHRCOfficialPage"&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/FactFindingMission.htm United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607053232/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/FactFindingMission.htm |date=7 June 2009 }}. [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. Retrieved 17 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The other co-authors of the Report were [[Hina Jilani]], [[Christine Chinkin]] and [[Desmond Travers]]. 

Israel refused to cooperate with the investigation, citing anti-Israel bias in the UNHRC and the mission's one-sided founding resolution.

The Goldstone Report accused both the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and the [[Palestinian militants]] of [[war crime]]s and possible [[crimes against humanity]]. It recommended that each side openly investigate its own conduct, and to bring the allegations to the [[International Criminal Court]] if they failed to do so.&lt;ref name=UNFFMGCReport_pdf&gt;{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf|title=Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|publisher=United Nations Human Rights Council|accessdate=15 September 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN condemns 'war crimes' in Gaza"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN condemns 'war crimes' in Gaza|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8257301.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of [[Israel]] rejected the report as prejudiced and full of errors, and also sharply rejected the charge that it had a policy of deliberately targeting civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1251804580173 'Syria, Somalia can't preach morality'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115100155/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&amp;cid=1251804580173# |date=15 January 2011 }} ''The Jerusalem Post'' 16 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The militant Islamic group [[Hamas]] initially rejected some of the report's findings,&lt;ref name="Chinaview"&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-10/08/content_12195495.htm ''Hamas drafts responses to its accusations in Goldstone report&amp;#91;http://www.ceia-sc.org/page37/page175/page175.html Goldstone Report&amp;#93;'']&lt;/ref&gt; but then urged world powers to embrace it.&lt;ref name="Haniyeh: World must back Goldstone's Gaza report"&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=226956 Haniyeh: World must back Goldstone's Gaza report], ''Ma'an'', 20 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstone stated that the mission "wasn't an investigation, it was a fact-finding mission" and that the conclusion that war crimes had been committed "was always intended as conditional". He described the allegations as "a useful road map" for independent investigations by Israel and the Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Goldstone: 'If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.'"&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/116269/ Goldstone: 'If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.'], The Forward, 16 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He later added that the mission did not conduct a judicial investigation, and stated that its findings did not amount to "the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt". He described it as a [[prima facie]] case, "reasonable on weighing the evidence" and said that the information obtained would not be admissible as evidence in a criminal court.&lt;ref name=push&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1255694848458&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull 'Probe by Israel would stop UN push'], JPost, 20 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial report received wide support among countries in the [[United Nations]], while Western countries were split between supporters and opponents of the resolutions endorsing the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8322584.stm Israel debates response to Gaza report], [[BBC News]] 24 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article6878669.ece Britain criticised for opting out of UN vote condemning Israel], ''[[The Times]]'' 17 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Israel-Warns-That-UN-Vote-On-Gaza-Conflict-report-Risks-Paralysing-The-Middle-East-Process/Article/200910315407388?lpos=World_News_Second_World_News_Feature_Teaser_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15407388_Israel_Warns_That_UN_Vote_On_Gaza_Conflict_report_Risks_Paralysing_The_Middle_East_Process 'Middle East Peace Process Faces Paralysis'], [[Sky News]] 18 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1118152.html Israel to UN body: Come to your senses on Goldstone Report], ''[[Haaretz]]'' 1 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the report stated that it contained methodological failings, legal and factual errors, and falsehoods, and devoted insufficient attention to the allegations that Hamas was deliberately operating in heavily populated areas of Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/nea/136070.htm 2009 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories].

On 1 April 2011, Goldstone retracted his claim that it was Israeli government policy to deliberately target citizens, saying "While the investigations published by the Israeli military and recognized in the U.N. committee's report have established the validity of some incidents that we investigated in cases involving individual soldiers, they also indicate that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html | work=The Washington Post | date=1 April 2011 | first=Kathleen | last=Parker | title=Should the U.S. seek to improve relations with Iran?}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2011 the three other co-authors of the Report, [[Hina Jilani]], [[Christine Chinkin]] and [[Desmond Travers]], released a joint statement criticizing Goldstone's recantation of this aspect of the report.

==Mandate of mission==
On 3 January 2009, in response to the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]'s executive committee asked UNHRC to send a fact-finding mission to Gaza.&lt;ref name="OIC initiated Goldstone inquiry"&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/10/20091021112649368100.html 'OIC initiated Goldstone inquiry'], Al Jazeera, 28 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 January, UNHRC adopted Resolution S-9/1:&lt;ref name="resolutions-9/1"&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/404E93E166533F828525754E00559E30 Text of UNHRC Resolution S-9/1, 12 January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

: to dispatch an urgent, independent international fact-finding mission, to be appointed by the President of the Council, to investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by the occupying Power, Israel, against the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, due to the current aggression, and calls upon Israel not to obstruct the process of investigation and to fully cooperate with the mission.&lt;ref name=resolution/&gt; 

[[Mary Robinson]], former [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], was asked by UNHRC President [[Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi|Martin Uhomoibhi]] to lead the Mission but expressed disappointment with the mandate and refused to head the Mission for that reason. She stated that the UNHRC resolution was one-sided and "guided not by human rights but by politics". She later expressed full support for the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theelders.org/media/news/accounting-gaza# |title=Accounting for Gaza, Mary Robinson, 30 September 2009 |access-date=19 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020173811/http://www.theelders.org/media/news/accounting-gaza# |archive-date=20 October 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Richard Goldstone initially refused the appointment for the same reason, calling the mandate "biased" and "uneven-handed". In January 2011, Goldstone said that UNHRC "repeatedly rush to pass condemnatory resolutions in the face of alleged violations of human rights law by Israel but fail to take similar action in the face of even more serious violations by other States. Until the Gaza Report they failed to condemn the firing of rockets and mortars at Israeli civilian centers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/02/judge_goldstone_contradicts_th.html Judge Goldstone Contradicts the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Goldstone's objection, the mandate was informally widened to cover activities by Palestinian militants as well, and the revised mandate, as quoted by the final report, became:&lt;ref name="UNHRCOfficialPage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstone_BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8076690.stm|title =Goldstone's UN inquiry team arrives in Gaza|date=1 June 2009|accessdate=4 June 2009|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: to investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or after.

Speaking at [[Brandeis University]], Goldstone noted that the widened mandate was presented by UNHRC President to a plenary session, where it did not encounter a single objection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtbHifKM6sM&amp;feature=player_embedded Goldstone in remarks at Brandeis university, cf. 08:30]&lt;/ref&gt; He later described as "tiresome and inept" allegations made by [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] that the mandate had not been broadened to cover violations by all parties.&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"/&gt; Despite Uhomoibhi's verbal commitment that there was no objection to the revised mandate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goldstone: Israel should cooperate|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=148974|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNHRC never voted to revise the mandate, and resolution S-9/1 remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/A-HRC-S-91-L1.doc Text of Resolution S-9/1 - the appointment of the mission followed the adoption on 12 January 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219083233/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/A-HRC-S-91-L1.doc |date=19 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission members==
According to the mission's report, "The President appointed Justice [[Richard Goldstone]], former judge of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]] and former Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia]] and [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|Rwanda]],&lt;ref name="RICHARD J. GOLDSTONE APPOINTED TO LEAD HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL FACT-FINDING MISSION ON GAZA CONFLICT"&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/0/2796E2CA43CA4D94C125758D002F8D25?opendocument RICHARD J. GOLDSTONE APPOINTED TO LEAD HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL FACT-FINDING MISSION ON GAZA CONFLICT], UNHRC, 3 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; to head the Mission. The other three appointed members were: [[Christine Chinkin]], Professor of International Law at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], who took part in a fact-finding mission to [[Beit Hanoun]] in 2008; [[Hina Jilani]], Advocate of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] and a member of the International [[Commission of Inquiry on Darfur]] in 2004; and [[Desmond Travers]], a former colonel in the [[Irish Defence Forces]] and member of the Board of Directors of the [[Institute for International Criminal Investigations]]."

[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) applauded the selection of Goldstone to head the mission, saying, "Justice Goldstone's reputation for fairness and integrity is unmatched, and his investigation provides the best opportunity to address alleged violations by both Hamas and Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/05/17/us-ask-israel-cooperate-goldstone-inquiry |title=US: Ask Israel to Cooperate with Goldstone Inquiry &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=17 May 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstone was a board member of HRW at that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/Bios_Gaza_FMM.doc# |title=Biographical information of the members |access-date=30 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703001832/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/Bios_Gaza_FMM.doc# |archive-date=3 July 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which HRW noted in its article. [[Gerald Steinberg]] of the Jerusalem-based [[NGO Monitor]] and journalist [[Melanie Phillips]] said that even though Goldstone resigned from HRW after the inquiry began, his impartiality was compromised by his link to an organization that accused Israel of war crimes.&lt;ref name="NGO Monitor: Gaza war probe tainted by anti-Israel ideology"&gt;[http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1113207.html NGO Monitor: Gaza war probe tainted by anti-Israel ideology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911221953/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1113207.html# |date=11 September 2009 }}, ''Haaretz,'' 8 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="From Gulag Liberators to Saudi Retainers"&gt;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NjNkYzBhMWNjZTNhZmY3ZDc3N2FhM2ViMzE5ODQ3ZWE From Gulag Liberators to Saudi Retainers] {{Webarchive|url=https://swap.stanford.edu/20090819134459/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NjNkYzBhMWNjZTNhZmY3ZDc3N2FhM2ViMzE5ODQ3ZWE# |date=19 August 2009 }}, NRO, 21 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Goldstone show-trial"&gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/5322971/the-goldstone-showtrial.thtml The Goldstone show-trial] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914070915/http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/5322971/the-goldstone-showtrial.thtml# |date=14 September 2009 }}, ''Spectator'', 11 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Goldstone, Travers and Jilani signed an open letter to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the United Nations Security Council, calling for those who perpetrated "gross violations of the laws of war", "gross violations of international humanitarian law" and "targeting of civilians" to be brought to account. The letter concluded: "The events in Gaza have shocked us to the core. Relief and reconstruction are desperately needed but, for the real wounds to heal, we must also establish the truth about crimes perpetuated against civilians on both sides."&lt;ref name="Gaza investigators call for war crimes inquiry "&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/20572/ Gaza investigators call for war crimes inquiry] Amnesty International, 16 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The chief rabbi of South Africa [[Warren Goldstein]] and Melanie Phillips asserted that this statement, made before the work of the mission has begun, violated provisions for impartiality of the fact-finding missions.&lt;ref name="The Goldstone show-trial"/&gt;&lt;ref name="It looks like law, but it's just politics"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&amp;cid=1255450652253&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull It looks like law, but it's just politics]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, JPost, 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Robinson called Goldstone "a dedicated and unimpeachable human rights lawyer and advocate" who "was able to work with the [Human Rights] Council's president to secure an agreement that he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted in such a way as to allow his team to address the actions taken by both parties to the conflict".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theelders.org/media/news/accounting-gaza Accounting for Gaza] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020173811/http://www.theelders.org/media/news/accounting-gaza# |date=20 October 2009 }}, [[Mary Robinson]], 30 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, before her appointment to the mission, [[Christine Chinkin]] co-signed a letter published in the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' describing Israel's military offensive in Gaza as "an act of aggression". The letter also stated that the firing of rockets by Hamas into Israel and [[Palestinian political violence|suicide bombings]] are "contrary to international humanitarian law and are war crimes".&lt;ref name="Analysis: The problem with Goldstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel's bombardment of Gaza is not self-defence – it's a war crime"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article5488380.ece Israel's bombardment of Gaza is not self-defence – it's a war crime], The Sunday Times, 11 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, among them [[Howard L.

==Investigation==
The mission convened on 4 May in Geneva and during a week-long session held meetings with UN Member States, NGOs and representatives of the UN. By the end of the session, the mission established its methodology and a three-month program of work.&lt;ref name="UNHRCOfficialPage"/&gt; The mission issued a press release on 8 May describing the mandate, progress and plans. Goldstone stated that the focus of the investigation would be on "an objective and impartial analysis of compliance of the parties to the conflict with their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law, especially their responsibility to ensure the protection of civilians and non-combatants," adding "I believe that an objective assessment of the issues is in the interests of all parties, will promote a culture of accountability and could serve to promote greater peace and security in the region."&lt;ref name="Un Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict Holds First Meeting in Geneva"&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/BC7C60F307A16D1BC12575B000315895?opendocument Un Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict Holds First Meeting in Geneva], UN, 8 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June, the mission invited "all interested persons and organizations to submit relevant information and documentation that will assist in the implementation of the Mission's mandate". Submissions were to focus on "events and conduct that occurred in the context of the armed conflict that took place between 27 December 2008 and 19 January 2009" and that "for the purposes of its mandate, events since June 2008 are particularly relevant to the conflict."&lt;ref name="UNHRCOfficialPage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Call for Submissions"&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/call_for_submissions.doc Call for Submissions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703002248/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/call_for_submissions.doc# |date=3 July 2010 }}, UN, 8 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission conducted two field visits to Gaza, entering through the [[Rafah Border Crossing]] from [[Egypt]] after access through Israel was denied. The first visit, on 1–5 June 2009, included a tour of the sites and interviews with victims and witnesses. Investigations continued during the second visit, from 26 June to 1 July, with public hearings.&lt;ref name="UNHRCOfficialPage"/&gt; In the course of the investigation, the committee conducted 188 interviews, reviewed 10,000 pages of documents and inspected 1,200 photographs.&lt;ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/world/middleeast/16gaza.html?hpw Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"], ''The New York Times'', 15 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel refused to cooperate with the investigation, [[Alleged United Nations bias in Israel-Palestine issues|citing anti-Israel bias]] in the UNHRC and the mission's one-sided founding resolution. Israel also stated that the mission would be unable to question Palestinian militants who fired rockets at Israel.&lt;ref name="Goldstone_BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Analysis: The problem with Goldstone"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1246443735904&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=Analysis: The problem with Goldstone|date=6 July 2009|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN's Gaza war crimes investigation faces obstacles"/&gt; The team was denied access to military sources, and entrance to Gaza via Israel.&lt;ref name="UN's Gaza war crimes investigation faces obstacles"/&gt;

At the end of a four-day trip, the head of the team expressed shock at the scale of destruction. Goldstone announced that the team would hold public hearings with the war's victims later in June, in Gaza and Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1090452.html |title=UN investigator 'shocked' by scale of destruction in Gaza – Haaretz – Israel News |publisher=Haaretz |date= |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Whiting, a professor at Harvard law school, said cases like the one being probed by the UN inquiry team are hard to investigate, especially without military records.&lt;ref name="UN's Gaza war crimes investigation faces obstacles"/&gt;

Israeli lawyer Charles Abelsohn criticized the objectivity of the committee members, citing Travers who said during the public hearings that "there have been instances of the shooting of children in front of their parents. As an ex-soldier I find that kind of action to be very, very strange and very unique", asking the witness to comment on those insights.&lt;ref name="Outcast"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=2&amp;cid=1255547726295&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Outcast]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, JPost, 22 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission's report states that during and after the investigation, several Palestinians cooperating with the Mission were detained by Israeli security forces. One of them was [[Muhammad Srour]], a member of the Popular Committee Against the Wall in [[Nilin]], who testified before the Mission in Geneva; en route back to West Bank he was arrested. After UN intervention, he was released. Israeli security sources said that Sruor was detained for questioning on suspicion that he was involved in terror activity and that his visit to Geneva had no bearing on the arrest.&lt;ref name="Palestinian arrested after testifying in Geneva"&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3750927,00.html Palestinian arrested after testifying in Geneva], YNET, 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Another witness, [[Shawan Jabarin]], General Director of the Palestinian human-rights organisation [[Al Haq]], had to be heard by videoconference, as he has been subject to a travel ban by Israel since 2006 preventing him from leaving the West Bank on the grounds that he is a senior member of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]].&lt;ref name="HCJ152009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alhaq.org/pdfs/Shawan-abarin-v.pdf|title=Shawan Rateb Abdullah Jabarin (The Petitioner) – Versus – The Commander of IDF Forces in the West Bank (The Respondent)|date=10 February 2009|publisher=[[Israeli High Court of Justice]]|accessdate=12 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203032314/http://www.alhaq.org/pdfs/Shawan-abarin-v.pdf|archive-date=3 February 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alhaq.org"&gt;http://www.alhaq.org/etemplate.php?id=438 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223163230/http://www.alhaq.org/etemplate.php?id=438 |date=23 February 2010 }} Dutch Foreign Minister Condemns Travel Ban Imposed by Israel on Al-Haq General Director.

==Report==
On 15 September 2009, a 574-page report was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf "Human Rights in Palestine and Other Occupied Arab Territories: Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict"]&lt;/ref&gt;
The report concluded that the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) and Palestinian militant groups had committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity. While the report condemned violations by both sides, it differentiated between the moral and legal severity of the violations of the Israeli forces compared to those of Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups.&lt;ref name=deen&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48448|quote=The U.N. team, led by Justice Richard Goldstone, says there is also evidence that Palestinian armed groups, specifically Hamas, committed war crimes in their repeated mortar attacks on civilians on southern Israel... But its strongest indictment is against the state of Israel, which is accused of imposing a blockade on Gaza "amounting to collective punishment" carried out as part of a "systematic policy of progressive isolation and deprivation of the Gaza Strip".|publisher=[[Inter Press Service]]|accessdate=16 October 2009|title=POLITICS: U.N.

From the facts gathered, the Mission found that the following grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention were committed by Israeli forces in Gaza: wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, and extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly. As grave breaches these acts give rise to individual criminal responsibility. The Mission notes that the use of human shields also constitutes a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court."]
&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Accusations against Israel==

===Blockade of Gaza allegations===
{{Main|2007–present blockade of the Gaza Strip}}
The report stated that the blockade constituted a violation of Israel's obligations as an occupying power in Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;p. 276ff&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civilian targeting allegations===
The report disputes Israel's claim that the Gaza war would have been conducted as a response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, saying that at least in part the war was targeted against the "people of Gaza as a whole". Intimidation against the population was seen as an aim of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf "1680. The Gaza military operations were, according to the Israeli Government, thoroughly and extensively planned. While the Israeli Government has sought to portray its operations as essentially a response to rocket attacks in the exercise of its right to self defence, the Mission considers the plan to have been directed, at least in part, at a different target: the people of Gaza as a whole."]&lt;/ref&gt; The report also says that Israel's military assault on Gaza was designed to "humiliate and terrorize a civilian population, radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself, and to force upon it an ever increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability".&lt;ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"/&gt;

The report focused on 36 cases that it said constituted a representative sample. In 11 of these episodes, it said the Israeli military carried out direct attacks against civilians, including some in which civilians were shot "while they were trying to leave their homes to walk to a safer place, waving white flags".&lt;ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"/&gt; Talking to [[Bill Moyers Journal]], Goldstone said that the committee chose 36 incidents that represented the highest death toll, where there seemed to be little or no military justification for what happened.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/10232009/watch.html Bill Moyers vs Richard Goldstone]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, another alleged war crime committed by IDF include "wanton" destruction of food production, water and sewerage facilities; the report also asserts that some attacks, which were supposedly aimed to kill small number of combatants amidst significant numbers of civilians, were disproportionate.&lt;ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"/&gt;

The report concluded that Israel violated the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] by targeting civilians, which it labeled "a grave breach".&lt;ref name=forward/&gt; It also claimed that the violations were "systematic and deliberate", which placed the blame in the first place on those who designed, planned, ordered and oversaw the operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007093730/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf |date=7 October 2009 }} Para 1692.&lt;/ref&gt; The report recommended, ''inter alia'', that Israel pay reparations to Palestinians living in Gaza for property damage caused during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48448 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916140944/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48448# |date=16 September 2009 }} "the Goldstone team has recommended that the 192-member General Assembly set up an escrow fund so that Israel can compensate the Palestinians of Gaza."&lt;br /&gt;http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf para 1665&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Maqadmah mosque incident===
{{Main|2009 Ibrahim al-Maqadna Mosque strike}}

The report stated that the strike on the al-Maqadmah mosque on the outskirts of Jabilyah occurred when between 200 and 300 men and women attended for their evening prayer, with 15 people being killed and 40 wounded as a result of the attack. The Mission has established that the Israeli armed forces fired a missile that struck near the doorway of the mosque. The Mission found that the mosque was damaged and lodged in its interior walls with "small metal cubes", several of which were retrieved by the Mission when it inspected the site. The Mission concluded that the mosque had been hit by an air-to-ground missile fitted with a shrapnel fragmentation sleeve, fired from an aircraft. The Mission based its findings on investigation of the site, photographs and interviewing witnesses. The Mission found no indications that the mosque was used to launch rockets, store munitions or shelter combatants. The Mission also found that no other damage was done in the area at the time, making the attack an isolated incident. The Mission concluded that the Israelis intentionally bombed the mosque.&lt;ref name=UNFFMGCReport_pdf/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNGazareport&gt;{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf|title=Human Rights in Palestine and Other Occupied Arab Territories|author=Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=15 September 2009|accessdate=15 September 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Goldstone said: "Assuming that weapons were stored in the mosque, it would not be a war crime to bomb it at night... It would be a war crime to bomb it during the day when 350 people are praying." He further added that there is no other possible interpretation for what could have occurred other than a deliberate targeting of civilians.&lt;ref name="Goldstone: 'If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.'"/&gt; The report also reproduces a statement from the Israeli government concerning the attack, where the Israeli government both denies that the mosque was attacked and states that the casualties of the attack were Hamas operatives. The report says that the position of the Israeli government contains "apparent contradictions" and is "unsatisfactory" and "demonstrably false".&lt;ref name=UNFFMGCReport_pdf/&gt;

===Zeitoun incident===
{{Main|Zeitoun incident}}

According to interviews with family members, neighbors, Palestinian Red Crescent personnel, submissions from various NGOs and visits to the site, the extended al-Samouni family gathered together in one house after the fighting in the area was over, ordered there by Israeli soldiers patrolling their Gaza neighborhood of Zeytoun as part of the ground phase of the Gaza War; when five men stepped out of the house to collect firewood, a missile struck them, fired, possibly, from an Apache helicopter; several more missiles followed, this time aimed directly at the house. In all, 21 family members were killed, including women and children. When the surviving al-Samounis attempted to leave and make their way to Gaza City, they were told by an Israeli soldier to return to the house.&lt;ref name="Goldstone: 'If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.'"/&gt; In April 2011, Goldstone wrote that the shelling of the home was apparently the consequence of an Israeli commander's erroneous interpretation of a drone image.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html Reconsidering the Goldstone Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Fakhura school incident===
{{Main|Al-Fakhura school incident}}

The report says that IDF's mortar shelling near a United Nations-run Al-Fakhura school in the Jabaliya refugee camp, which was sheltering some 1,300 people, killed 35 and wounded up to 40 people. The investigation did not exclude the possibility that Israeli forces were responding to fire from an armed Palestinian group, as Israel said, but said that this and similar attacks "cannot meet the test of what a reasonable commander would have determined to be an acceptable loss of civilian life for the military advantage sought".&lt;ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"/&gt; The mission criticized IDF for the choice of the weapons for the supposed counterstrike and concluded that the IDF fire at the Al-Fakhura street violated the law of proportionality.&lt;ref name="Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict"&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict], UNHCR report, 25 September 2009, para. 696–698, late submission&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Israeli officials acknowledged that contrary to earlier claims, no rockets were fired from schools operated by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) during the Gaza war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=1477 No rockets from UNRWA schools in Gaza during the Gaza war of 2008-2009 (UNRWA, 24 October 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abd Rabbo family incident===
{{Main|Abd Rabbo family incident}}
According to the Mission's report, the committee found Khaled and Kawthar Abd Rabbo to be credible and reliable witnesses and it had no reason to doubt the veracity of the main elements of their testimony, which it says is consistent with the accounts it received from other eyewitnesses and NGOs.&lt;ref name="Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict 2"&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict], UNHRC, 25 September 2009, para. 777&lt;/ref&gt; The report concludes that the Israeli soldiers deliberately shot at the family members, as they could not perceive any danger from the house, its occupants or the surroundings. The report bases its conclusion on the premise that the family, consisting of a man, a young and an elderly woman and three small girls, some of them waving white flags, stepped out of the house and stood still for several minutes waiting for instructions from the soldiers.&lt;ref name="Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict 2"/&gt;

The report says that Israeli forces were "systematically reckless" in determining the use of [[white phosphorus]] in built-up areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf Page 21 of the HUMAN RIGHTS IN PALESTINE AND OTHER OCCUPIED ARAB TERRITORIES], Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict&lt;/ref&gt; The writers highlighted the Israeli attack on the UN Relief and Works Agency compound in Gaza City on 15 January, the attack on the Al Quds hospital, and the attack on the Al Wafa hospital, each of which involved using white phosphorus. They described its use as disproportionate or excessive under [[international law]]. More generally, the UN report recommended that "serious consideration should be given to banning the use of white phosphorus in built-up areas".&lt;ref name="UN accuses Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6835910.ece|title=UN accuses Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza|date=16 September 2009|publisher=[[Times Online]]|first=James|last=Bone|accessdate=16 October 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human shields allegations===
The report also accused Israel of using Palestinians as "[[human shields]]" and torturing detainees.&lt;ref name="UN accuses Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza"/&gt; The human shields accusations were supported in 2010, with Israel charging two soldiers with forcing a 9-year-old Palestinian boy to open bags suspected of containing bombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1155800.html Two IDF soldiers charged with using 9-year-old 'human shield' in Gaza war (''Haaretz'', 11 March 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations against Palestinian militants==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
The report also stated there is evidence that Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity by deliberately launching rockets and firing mortars into Israel, calculated to kill civilians and damage civilian structures.&lt;ref name=BBCSept15a&gt;{{Cite news

It also concluded that killings and abuses of members of the Fatah political movement amount to a "serious violation of human rights".&lt;ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"/&gt;

While discussing an obligation of Palestinian armed groups to protect the civilian population in Gaza, the report notes that those interviewed in Gaza appeared reluctant to speak about the presence of or conduct of hostilities by the Palestinian armed groups. The Mission does not discount that the interviewees' reluctance may have stemmed from a fear of reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict], para. 440&lt;/ref&gt; The report also criticized the treatment of captured Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]], and called for his release.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Reactions==

===Israel===
The Israeli government issued an initial 32-point formal response to the fact-finding mission's report on 24 September 2009. The response listed a series of what it argued were serious flaws and biases in the report, finally concluding that the report perverts international law to serve a political agenda. ([[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict#Preliminary analysis by Israel|See below]].)

Also in October 2009, Israel pressured the Palestinian president to postpone asking for a UN vote on the Goldstone report. [[Yuval Diskin]], head of the Israeli Shin Bet security service, met in [[Ramallah]] with President Mahmud Abbas and informed him that if Abbas refuses to ask to postpone the UN vote on the Goldstone report then Israel will turn the [[West Bank]] into a "second Gaza": the Shin Bet chief told Abbas that if he did not ask for a deferral of the vote, Israel would withdraw permission for mobile phone company Wataniya to operate in the Palestinian Authority and threatened to revoke the easing of restrictions on movement within the West Bank that had been implemented earlier in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'', 17 January 2010, "Diskin to Abbas: Defer UN Vote on Goldstone or Face 'Second Gaza,'" http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1143038.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shimon Peres in WEF on the Middle East 2009.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]] said the mission's report "makes a mockery of history".]]
[[President of Israel|Israeli President]] [[Shimon Peres]] said that the report "makes a mockery of history" and that "it does not distinguish between the aggressor and the defender. War is crime and the attacker is the criminal. The defender has no choice. The Hamas terror organization is the one who started the war and also carried out other awful crimes. Hamas has used terrorism for years against Israeli children." Peres also stated that "the report gives de facto legitimacy to terrorist initiatives and ignores the obligation and right of every country to defend itself, as the UN itself had clearly stated." He added that the report "Failed to supply any other way for Hamas fire to stop. The IDF's operations have boosted the West Bank's economy, liberated Lebanon from Hezbollah terror and allowed Gazans to resume normalcy. The Israeli government withdrew (from Gaza) and Hamas began a murderous rampage, firing thousands of shells on women and children – innocent civilians, instead of rebuilding Gaza and caring for the population's welfare. (Hamas) builds tunnels and used civilians and children to shield terrorists and hide weapons."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3777814,00.html Peres: Goldstone Report makes mockery of history], Ynet News 16 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] said: "The Goldstone Report is a field court-martial, and its findings were prewritten. This is a prize for terror. The report makes it difficult for democracies to fight terror."&lt;ref name=prize&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3778079,00.html Netanyahu: Goldstone Report 'a prize for terror'], Ynet News 16 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, Netanyahu said that the report ignored [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza]] and the [[Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel|Palestinian rocket attacks]] that preceded the war. He also warned world leaders that they and their anti-terror forces could be targets for charges similar to those in the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=1115418&amp;contrassID=0&amp;subContrassID=0 Netanyahu asks world to reject Goldstone findings], ''Haaretz'' 5 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[United Nations General Assembly]], Netanyahu called the report biased and unjust, asking: "Will you stand with Israel or will you stand with the terrorists? We must know the answer to that question now. Only if we have the confidence that we can defend ourselves can we take further risks for peace."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/24/AR2009092404598.html Israeli Leader Blasts Ahmadinejad at U.N.], 24 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of Israel will continue to protect its citizens from the attacks of the terrorists and the terror organizations, and will continue to protect its soldiers from hypocritical and distorted attacks."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1251804591568&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Lieberman: UN commission established in advance to blame Israel]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Jerusalem Post'', 17 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preliminary analysis by Israel====
The [[Cabinet of Israel|Government of Israel]] issued a 32-point preliminary analysis of the report, titled "Initial Response to Report of the Fact Finding Mission on Gaza Established Pursuant to Resolution S-9/1 of the Human Rights Council". The main arguments in the analysis were the following.
{{Quotation|
# The resolution mandating the mission was one-sided and prejudicial and the terms of the mandate were never changed.
# The composition of the Mission and its conduct raised serious questions about its impartiality.
# Incidents selected for examination were cherry-picked for political effect.
# The mission displayed double standards in acceptance of evidence: treating even photographic evidence presented by Israel as inherently untrustworthy, except when it could be used to condemn Israel, while uncritically accepting statements by Hamas; reinterpreting or dismissing self-incriminating statements by Hamas; and selectively quoting material from sources.
# The report includes misstatements of fact: for example, it stated that Israel discriminated against its non-Jewish citizens in providing shelter from Palestinian rocket attacks, when the shelter was provided on the basis of proximity to the Gaza Strip and did not discriminate between Jews and non-Jews.
# The report contains misstatements of law: for example, its description of the Israeli appeals process is outdated.
# The report fails to consider the military complexities of the war, makes judgments lacking necessary knowledge, and ignores Israel's extensive efforts to maintain humanitarian standards and protect civilians.
# The report unjustifiably minimizes the threat of terrorism and in effect vindicates terrorist tactics.
# The report presents its findings as judicial determinations of guilt, despite its admission that it does not reach a judicial level of proof; it commits egregious legal errors, including unjustifiable assumptions regarding intent and commanders' states of mind, as well as misinterpretation of the willfulness requirement of responsibility under international law.
# The report ignores Israel's own investigations into its conduct, overlooks the many independent levels of scrutiny in Israel's judicial system, misrepresents Israel's legal mechanisms and shows disdain for democratic values.
# The report makes one-sided recommendations against Israel while making only token recommendations with respect to Palestinians: for example, recommending Israel compensate Palestinians for attacks without recommending Palestinians compensate Israelis for attacks.}}

The analysis concludes that the report claims to represent international law but perverts it to serve a political agenda; that it sends a "legally unfounded message to states everywhere confronting terrorism that international law has no effective response to offer them", and that it signals to terrorist groups "that the cynical tactics of seeking to exploit civilian suffering for political ends actually pays dividends".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131001094449/http://www.mfa.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/FC985702-61C4-41C9-8B72-E3876FEF0ACA/0/GoldstoneReportInitialResponse240909.pdf Initial Response to Report of the Fact Finding Mission on Gaza] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001094449/http://www.mfa.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/FC985702-61C4-41C9-8B72-E3876FEF0ACA/0/GoldstoneReportInitialResponse240909.pdf |date=1 October 2013 }}, [[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestinian National Authority===
[[File:Mahmoud abbas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] ]]
Following the postponing of the vote on the resolution in UNHRC, the [[Palestinian National Authority]] came under heavy criticism for agreeing to defer the draft proposal endorsing all recommendations of the UN Fact Finding Mission. Several Palestinian human rights organizations, condemning the PA's action, issued a statement under the title "Justice Delayed is Justice Denied".&lt;ref name="PA slammed for bumping Goldstone draft"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1254393087797&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull PA slammed for bumping Goldstone draft], JPost, 4 October 2009. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbas agreed to postpone the vote on the Goldstone report following a confrontational meeting with [[Yuval Diskin]], head of the Israeli [[Shin Bet]] security service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1143038.html "Diskin to Abbas: Defer UN Vote on Goldstone or Face 'Second Gaza'" ''Haaretz'', 17 Jan. 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas announced on 4 October that a new committee would be established in order to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deferral of the UN vote on the Goldstone Report.&lt;ref name="Abbas: Probe decision to defer vote"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1254662089811&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Abbas: Probe decision to defer vote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124225652/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&amp;cid=1254662089811# |date=24 January 2011 }}, JPost, 4 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas officials in Gaza demanded Abu Mazen resignation for supporting the postponement of the vote at the UN Human Rights Council. [[Mahmoud al-Zahar]] said that Abbas was guilty of "a very big crime against the Palestinian people" over the PA's conduct at UNHRC.&lt;ref name="PA's Goldstone block linked to tape"/&gt;

Palestinian representative to the United Nations [[Ibrahim Khraishi]] called the report unbiased and professionally compiled. He further added, "This report was important; what bothered some parties was that the report simply monitored international law, international humanitarian law and all relevant international instruments. This was not a political instrument that supported Palestine or Israel." He added the report was the first time killings of Palestinian civilians have been documented, and that his people would not forgive if those responsible were not punished.&lt;ref name="Kuwaitnews"&gt;[http://www.kuna.net.kw/NewsAgenciesPublicSite/ArticleDetails.aspx?Language=en&amp;id=2028226 Arab, African groups, OIC, NAM welcome Goldstone report (Kuwait News Agency, Sept. 29, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven Palestinian human rights organizations, including two based in Israel, called on the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas government in Gaza to investigate Palestinian violations of international law allegedly committed during the Gaza War. Alleged violations include Palestinian attacks on civilians in Israel and instances of internal repression, such as summary executions in the Gaza Strip and arrests and torture in the West Bank. The letter asked to launch investigations before the 5 February deadline. The authors of the call said that for PLO efforts to have the report endorsed by the UN to be of lasting value, the Palestinian authorities must take action to implement its recommendations.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1143330.html Palestinian activists urge Hamas to probe own Gaza war crimes], ''Haaretz'', 18 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governments and regional organizations===

====United States====
Ambassador [[Susan Rice]], the U.S. permanent representative to the UN, said: "We have very serious concerns about many recommendations in the report"&lt;ref name=jpost&gt;E. B.

A presidential advisor on Middle East policy told a group of American Jewish leaders in November 2010 that the U.S. government was committed to curbing actions by the UN on the Goldstone Report.&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'', 2010 Nov 14, "U.S. Offers Israel Warplanes in Return for New Settlement Freeze", http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/u-s-offers-israel-warplanes-in-return-for-new-settlement-freeze-1.324496&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shelley Berkley]] of Nevada and [[Eliot Engel]] of New York wrote in a joint statement: "Israel took every reasonable step to avoid civilian casualties ... It is ridiculous to claim that Israel did not take appropriate actions to protect civilian populations."&lt;ref name="jpost"/&gt;

Perceived unwillingness on the part of the United States to act on the report was criticized by the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM), which represents 118 nations, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], Stephen Zunes, professor of politics and international studies at the University of San Francisco, and [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48864# |title=POLITICS: U.S. Berated for Shielding Israel on Gaza Killings (IPS, 14 October 2009) |access-date=15 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020015504/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48864# |archive-date=20 October 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naomi Klein]] stated that instead of proving its commitment to international law, the United States is smearing the "courageous" report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20091102/klein Obama's Bad Influence (''The Nation'', 14 October 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;*The commission's report lacks context. It does not take account of the nature of Israel's enemy – operating from the midst of civilian populations, committed to Israel's destruction, and fully supported by state actors Iran and Syria.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;*The report does not take into account the extent to which witnesses from Gaza were likely intimidated by Hamas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;*In general, the report is credulous of Hamas claims but skeptical of Israeli claims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Goldstone and several U.S.-based rights groups denounced the resolution. [[Sarah Leah Whitson]], a director of Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, commented that "this sort of resolution sends a terrible message to the international community about American willingness to believe in international justice for all. I hope that the members of Congress reject it. It's funny because it accuses the Goldstone Report of being one sided but it's not.

*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} Dutch foreign minister Maxime Verhagen said both Israel and the Palestinian Authority must investigate war crimes allegations, saying "there can be no impunity for serious human rights violations both on the Palestinian and the Israeli side". Verhagen also urged Israel to halt building settlements in the West Bank, calling the practice a serious obstacle to peace, which "will have to stop".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidANA20091111T135450ZKZS18 Netherlands urges Israel to probe Gaza war (AFP, Nov. 11, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{flagicon|Nigeria}} The Nigerian ambassador to the UNHRC, Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi, said that he Council should not dilute its efforts by vilifying the Fact-Finding Mission members and parts of the report – no useful purpose would be served by compounding the human rights situation in the region through sheer rhetoric or failure to act. He said, "The implementation of the report was crucial to addressing the pernicious issues of impunity and accountability".&lt;ref name="Kuwaitnews"/&gt;

===Non-government organizations===

Israeli human rights group [[B'Tselem]], along with eight other Israeli human-rights NGOs, stated that they "expect the Government of Israel to respond to the substance of the report's findings and to desist from its current policy of casting doubt upon the credibility of anyone who does not adhere to the establishment's narrative".&lt;ref name=btselem&gt;{{cite web

At the same time, she urged to check out every incident and every policy by an independent body, because in her view the military cannot check itself and it has to be explained why so many people had been killed.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

The [[European Centre for Law and Justice]] (ECLJ) – the international affiliate of the American Center for Law and Justice – claimed in its analyses of the Report that among numerous flaws in it, the Mission misstated the International Humanitarian Law regarding the obligation of the fighters engaged in hostilities to distinguish themselves from the civilian population by uniform (perfidy violation per [[s:Protocol I#Art 37. Prohibition of Perfidy|Article 37]] of the [[Protocol I]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclj.org/pdf/ECLJ_MemoonGoldstoneReport_20100126.pdf Legal Memorandum in Opposition to Erroneous Allegations and Flawed Legal Conclusions Contained in the Goldstone Report], p. 46 of the report (p. 48 of the file), ECLJ, 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UN Watch]] criticized Goldstone's report methodologies that allegedly dismissed or ignored much of the evidence provided in Israeli Government report from July 2009 on the one hand and on the other hand endorsed unquestionably testimonies by Gaza officials.&lt;ref name="Goldstone report cites same Hamas witness who claims Israel distributes libido-increasing gum"&gt;[http://blog.unwatch.org/index.php/2009/09/29/goldstone-report-cites-same-hamas-witness-who-claims-israel-distributes-libido-increasing-gum/ Goldstone report cites same Hamas witness who claims Israel distributes libido-increasing gum], UN Watch, 29 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] made similar charges.&lt;ref name="World according to Goldstone"&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3790355,00.html World according to Goldstone], YNET, 15 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalism===
The ''[[Financial Times]]'' (UK) called the report balanced and criticized attacks on Goldstone. It argued, however, that Israeli objections to the UNHRC were on strong ground, stating, "council members from [[Libya]] to [[Angola]] hide behind the Palestinian cause to deflect attention from their own records of serious human rights abuse."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/425c2276-bcdb-11de-a7ec-00144feab49a.html Goldstone's Gaza report is balanced], ''Financial Times'' 19 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Independent]]'' wrote that Israel should open a parliamentary investigation after the model of the [[Kahan Commission]] to look into its actions in Gaza. The paper wrote, "Strong democratic nations are able to scrutinise their own behaviour, even in times of conflict. It is time for Israel to demonstrate its own democratic strength."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-israel-must-investigate-seriously-1887449.html Leading article: Israel must investigate seriously (''The Independent'', 3 February 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' (UK) denounced the report as "deeply flawed" and detrimental to the [[Israeli-Palestinian peace process]], arguing that it was tainted by anti-Israel prejudice in the UNHRC. In particular, ''The Economist'' chastised the mission for saying there was little or no evidence showing Hamas endangered civilians by basing themselves around schools, mosques and hospitals, as the charge was supported by many reports in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14455609 Opportunity missed], ''[[The Economist]]'', 19 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' (UK) criticized the report as "provocative bias" and described as dangerous and unreasonable the moral equivalence drawn in the report between Israel and Hamas. ''The Times'' praised Israel for quietly continuing to conduct its own investigation into the conflict despite the report, and concluded that Israel "is an accountable, democratic, transparent nation, and fighting to remain one amid challenges that few other nations ever have to face".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article7011611.ece White Phosphorus: Israel is a nation both keen and able to hold itself to account], ''[[The Times]]'' 2 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that "... the Goldstone commission proceeded to make a mockery of impartiality with its judgment of facts. It concluded, on scant evidence, that "disproportionate destruction and violence against civilians were part of a deliberate policy" by Israel. At the same time it pronounced itself unable to confirm that Hamas hid its fighters among civilians, used human shields, fired mortars and rockets from outside schools, stored weapons in mosques, and used a hospital for its headquarters, despite abundant available evidence".&lt;ref name="War unchecked"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/14/AR2009111402279.html War unchecked], 15 November 2009, ''The Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' criticized the report, calling it a "new low" in United Nations bias on Israel-related matters. WSJ wrote that the commission's members "were forced to make some astonishing claims of fact" in order to reach some of their conclusions. In particular, WSJ criticized the report's claim that the Gaza police force was a "civilian" agency and its inability to establish Palestinian use of mosques for military purposes despite evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204518504574423652321177372 |title=Gaza Report Shows Anti-Israel Bias - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military commentators===
Colonel [[Richard Kemp]], former commander of [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|British forces in Afghanistan]], addressed the UNHRC in October 2009, speaking on behalf of [[UN Watch]]. He said that Hamas is "adept at staging and distorting incidents" and asserted that during the conflict the Israel Defense Forces "did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any other army in the history of warfare" and that Palestinian civilian casualties were a consequence of Hamas' way of fighting, which involved using human shields as a matter of policy, and deliberate attempts to sacrifice their own civilians. He added that Israel took extraordinary measures to give Gaza civilians notice of targeted areas, aborted potentially effective missions in order to prevent civilian casualties, and took "unthinkable" risks by allowing huge amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza during the fighting.&lt;ref name="Mistakes are not"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Mistakes-are-not-war-crimes |title='Mistakes are not war crimes': UNHRC endorses Goldstone's Gaza report by large majority|publisher= ''The Jerusalem Post''|date= 16 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstone stated that Kemp was not interviewed "because the report did not deal with the issues he raised regarding the problems of conducting military operations in civilian areas".&lt;ref name="OutcastPg1"&gt;David E Kaplan, [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&amp;cid=1255547726295&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Richard Goldstone: Outcast]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, pg. 1, ''The Jerusalem Post'', 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Major General [[Jim Molan]] (retired), who served as chief of operations of the Iraq multinational force in 2004–05, stated that "The Goldstone report is an opinion by one group of people putting forward their judgments, with limited access to the facts, and reflecting their own prejudices. The difference in tone and attitude in the report when discussing Israeli and Hamas actions is surprising." ... "as a soldier who has run a war against an opponent not dissimilar to Hamas, facing problems perhaps similar to those faced by Israeli commanders, my sympathies tend to lie with the Israelis." ... "But having stated my prejudice, I think I may be more honest than Goldstone, who seems to pass off his prejudices in a report that cannot be based on fact, and uses judicial language and credibility to do so. It comes down to equality of scepticism: if you refuse to believe anything the Israelis say, then you have no right to unquestioningly accept what Hamas says."&lt;ref name="UN's bias binds Gaza"&gt;Jim Molan, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26152548-7583,00.html UN's bias binds Gaza], ''The Australian'', 2 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal commentators===
Writing in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' Italian Jurist [[Antonio Cassese]] who was the first President of the International Criminal Tribunal For the Former Yugoslavia argued that critics of the report were relying primarily on [[ad hominem]] and [[strawman]] attacks. He argued that "critics have given inaccurate descriptions of the report's findings" and that "those who claim the mission's mandate was biased against Israel seem to have ignored a significant fact: Justice Goldstone, whose mission was initially asked to look into alleged violations only by Israel, demanded—and received—a change of mandate to include attacks by Hamas." Furthermore, he argued that many critics of the report "have launched personal attacks on Justice Goldstone's character" and some critics have even gone as far as labeling Goldstone, who is Jewish, "an 'anti-Semite' of a kind who 'despise and hate our own people'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/leading-international-jurist-on-goldstone-report/ We must stand behind the UN report on Gaza]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Canadian Minister of Justice]], [[Attorney General of Canada]], former president of the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] and former Director of the Human Rights Program at [[McGill University]] Professor [[Irwin Cotler]] called the inquiry "inherently tainted", agreeing with Mary Robinson and Richard Goldstone that its original mandate was "deeply one-sided and flawed" prior to being broadened, and stating that the UNHRC is "systematically and systemically biased against Israel".&lt;ref&gt;The Goldstone Mission – Tainted to the core (part I), ''The Jerusalem Post'' 18 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed the report, which he regarded as "tainted". At the same time, he is in favor of establishing an independent inquiry into the Gaza war, saying that Israel would set a precedent if it creates such an inquiry that according to his best knowledge "no other democracy" had.&lt;ref name="Cotler: Israel should probe Gaza war"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1256150020918&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Cotler: Israel should probe Gaza war]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Jerusalem Post'', 22 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Princeton university|Princeton]] professor emeritus of international law [[Richard Falk]], appointed in 2008 by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC) to serve as a [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on "the situation of human rights in the [[Palestinian territories]] occupied since 1967", endorsed the report as "an historic contribution to the Palestinian struggle for justice, an impeccable documentation of a crucial chapter in their victimization under occupation". Writing in [[Electronic Intifada]], Falk further commented that the report appeared to him to be "more sensitive" to Israel's contentions that Hamas was guilty of war crimes, and that the report in many ways "endorses the misleading main line of the Israeli narrative". Falk was critical of charges that the report, or the UNHRC, were biased and inferred that such criticism amounted to an attempt to "avoid any real look at the substance of the charges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nigelparry.net |url=http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article10788.shtml |title=ei: The Goldstone report and the battle for legitimacy |publisher=Electronicintifada.net |date= |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[York University]] scholar of human rights and humanitarian law Professor [[Anne Bayefsky]] said that the report, which claims to be a human rights document, never mentions the racist, genocidal intent of the enemy, which Israel confronted after years of restraint. She added that the report relies on testimonies from witnesses speaking under circumstances that gave rise to "a fear of reprisals" from Hamas should they have dared to tell the truth.&lt;ref name="Obama's new leverage—against its ally"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1254827721458&amp;pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull Obama's new leverage – against its ally], JPost, 6 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard]] law professor [[Alan Dershowitz]] wrote that the problem with the report is what its composers willfully and deliberately refused to see and hear. He said that the commission ignored easily accessible videotapes that show Hamas operatives routinely firing rockets from behind human shields, and the report dismissed eyewitness accounts published by reputable newspapers and admissions by Hamas leaders regarding Hamas military activities.&lt;ref name="Goldstone report is an ad hominem attack"&gt;[http://cgis.jpost.com/Blogs/dershowitz/entry/goldstone_report_is_an_ad Goldstone report is an ad hominem attack] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930054712/http://cgis.jpost.com/Blogs/dershowitz/entry/goldstone_report_is_an_ad# |date=30 September 2009 }}, JPost, 27 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Toronto]] professor of law [[Ed Morgan (professor)|Ed Morgan]] wrote in ''the [[Toronto Star]]'' that in dealing with the alleged use of human shielding of the Gaza civilian population by Hamas, the report "put its head in the sand", saying merely that "[t]he mission notes that those interviewed in Gaza appeared reluctant to speak about the presence of or conduct of hostilities by the Palestinian armed groups". The article also criticized the way the committee dismissed first-hand evidences from IDF soldiers implying that mosques were used as launching points for Hamas attacks and as weapons storage facilities.&lt;ref name="Goldstone report undermines faith in international law"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/713921 Goldstone report undermines faith in international law] The Toronto Star, 22 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Daniel Friedmann]], who served as the [[Justice Minister of Israel]] during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], criticized what he called the "reinterpretation" of evidence unfavorable to Hamas. As an example, he cites the statement of the Hamas police force spokesman saying that "police officers received clear orders from the leadership to face the [Israeli] enemy". He says that the committee uncritically accepted the explanation that the intention was that in the event of an invasion, the police would continue to uphold public order and ensure the movement of essential supplies.&lt;ref name="Goldstone report—the terrorists' Magna Carta"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1256799045773&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter 'Goldstone report – the terrorists' Magna Carta'], ''The Jerusalem Post'', 29 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the [[JURIST]], Laurie Blank of Emory Law's International Humanitarian Law Clinic and Gregory Gordon of the University of North Dakota School of Law said that the Goldstone Report's major flaw is that it fails the law. In their view, the Report incorrectly claims Israel disproportionately attacked civilians by relying on information gathered after the fact and discounting contemporaneous Israeli intentions or actions and the surrounding circumstances; the Report unjustly accuses Israel of a disproportionate response to eight years of Hamas's attacks, unfairly presenting Operation Cast Lead as disproportionate overall; the Report treats Israel and Hamas disproportionately by holding them to different standards, merely suggesting that Hamas's actions "would constitute" legal violations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2009/11/goldstone-gaza-and-disproportionality.php Goldstone, Gaza and (Dis)Proportionality: Three Strikes], ''Jurist'', 4 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Noam Shalit, father of Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]] held captive by Hamas, urged the UN to take all possible measures to implement the Goldstone report's recommendations on the status of his son.

[[Noam Chomsky]] argued that the Goldstone report is biased in favour of Israel since the report failed to question Israel's contention that it was acting in self-defence. Chomsky stressed that the right to self-defence requires that peaceful means are first exhausted before resorting to military force, something Israel "did not even contemplate doing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=35407 Noam Chomsky: no change in US 'Mafia principle' (Middle East Online, Nov. 1, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Landes]], who also maintains the "Understanding the Goldstone Report" site, published in the December 2009 volume of the Israeli [[Middle East Review of International Affairs|MERIA]] Journal critical analyses of the Goldstone report. Landes argued that the report fails to investigate seriously the problem of Hamas embedding its war effort in the midst of civilian infrastructure in order to draw Israeli fire and then accuse Israel of war crimes; the report is credulous concerning all Palestinian claims, contrasted with a corresponding skepticism of all Israeli claims; the report harshly judges Israel for war crimes, contrasted with its resolute agnosticism concerning Hamas intentions. Landes concluded that Goldstone actually participates in Hamas' strategy, which, according to Landes, encourages the sacrificing of their own civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gloria-center.org/meria/2009/12/landes1.html Goldstone's Gaza Report: Part One: a Failure of Intelligence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413232650/http://www.gloria-center.org/meria/2009/12/landes1.html |date=13 April 2010 }}, ''Meria Journal'', Volume 13, No. 4 – December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on the independent U.S. news broadcaster [[Democracy Now]], [[Norman Finkelstein]] questioned the way the report judged the events in Gaza based on the [[laws of war]], saying that Gaza did not meet the criteria of a war zone, calling it instead a "massacre". He went on to say that there was no fighting in Gaza, and referred to quotes from the testimonies of the Israeli soldiers published in the report by NGO [[Breaking the Silence (non-governmental organization)|Breaking the Silence]]. Concerning the substance of the report, Finkelstein says the Goldstone report is in-line with reports compiled by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch in the findings that Israel had targeted civilians and the Palestinian infrastructure.&lt;ref name="democracynow.org"&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2009/9/16/un_inquiry_finds_israel_punished_and ''UN Inquiry Finds Israel "Punished and Terrorized" Palestinian Civilians, Committed War Crimes During Gaza Assault'', Democracy Now!, 16 September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission members' responses to criticism===
Goldstone dismissed accusations of anti-Israel bias in his report as "ridiculous"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/15/un-gaza-war-israel-hamas Guardian: UN Gaza report accuses Israel and Hamas of war crimes] 'He rejected any suggestion of bias: "To accuse me of being anti-Israel is ridiculous."'&lt;/ref&gt; and invited "fair minded people" to read the report and "at the end of it, point out where it failed to be objective or even-handed".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8257301.stm BBC: UN condemns 'war crimes' in Gaza]&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in the UNHRC, Goldstone rejected what he called a "barrage of criticism" about his findings and said the answers to such criticism are in the findings of the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8280181.stm BBC: Goldstone defends UN Gaza report]&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstone said that the United States, for example, had failed to substantiate its charges that the report was biased. In an interview with [[Al Jazeera]], Goldstone challenged the Obama administration to identify the flaws the U.S. said it has found in the report.&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48683 ISRAEL-US: Goldstone Rejects Netanyahu Remarks (IPS)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net"&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/10/200910224044179743.html Goldstone dares US on Gaza report (Al Jazeera English, 22 October 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Dershowitz]] in his analyses of the Report responded that as of January 2010 Goldstone had generally refused to reply substantively to credible critics of the Report and declined Dershowitz's offer to publicly debate Goldstone about its contents.&lt;ref name=dersh&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=167379 The Case Against Goldstone Report: Study in Evidentiary Bias], JPost, 31 January 2010; [http://www.alandershowitz.com/goldstone.pdf Case Against Goldstone Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304071257/http://www.alandershowitz.com/goldstone.pdf# |date=4 March 2011 }}, Alan Dershowitz&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstone referred to his experiences of South Africa to reject Israeli PM Netanyahu's arguments that the report would make peacemaking more difficult, saying, "truth-telling and acknowledgement to victims can be a very important assistance to peace."&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net"/&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', published on 7 October 2009, Goldstone emphasized that his task was to conduct a "fact-finding mission" and not an "investigation". He acknowledged the reliance on Palestinian (Gazan and Hamas) testimonies, noting his mission cross-checked those accounts against each other and sought corroboration from photos, satellite photos, contemporaneous reports, forensic evidence and the mission's own inspections of the sites in question. He further acknowledged that "We had to do the best we could with the material we had. If this were a court of law there would have been nothing proven.... I would not consider it in any way embarrassing if many of the allegations turn out to be disproved."&lt;ref name=forward&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/116269/ |title=Goldstone: 'If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.' – |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' published a brief telephone interview with Desmond Travers in which he was asked to respond to criticism of the mission and the report. He rejected the criticism that insufficient weight was given to the difficulties of fighting in the urban environment, and said that he was surprised by what he called "the intensity and viciousness of the personal attacks aimed at members of the Mission". He also said that the mission found no evidence that mosques were used to store munitions; in two cases investigated, neither was used as anything but a place of worship. He added that he had seen no credible criticism of the report itself or of the information in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harpers.org/archive/2009/10/hbc-90006003 Six Questions for Desmond Travers on the Goldstone Report] ''Harpers Magazine'' 29 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Travers' statement regarding the use of mosques was challenged by a researcher at JCPA Colonel (res.) Halevi. Halevi said that the use of mosques as munition storage is supported by photographs of weapons seized in the Salah a-Din mosque in Gaza City during the operation, and the committee did not explain why it chose to disregard the information completely.&lt;ref name="What happened at mosque?"&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3804323,00.html What happened at mosque?], YNET, 12 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==

===Human Rights Council===

[[File:Gaza War UNHRC vote.png|thumb|250px|UN Human Rights Council vote on the resolution. Green represents support, blue represents opposition, brown means abstain, and tan means absent.]]
The vote for the UNHRC resolution endorsing the report was delayed on 2 October 2009 until the council's meeting in March 2010, after Palestinian delegation dropped its support for a resolution, apparently under heavy U.S. pressure.&lt;ref name="UN delays action on Gaza war report"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/02/united-nations-israel-gaza-war UN delays action on Gaza war report], ''The Guardian'', 2 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; But on 11 October, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called on the UN Human Rights Council to hold a special session to endorse the Goldstone Report.&lt;ref name="Abbas wants UN session on Goldstone"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1255204773689&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Abbas wants UN session on Goldstone], JPost, 12 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; UN officials announced that the UN Human Rights Council would reopen the debate about the report's findings on 15 October.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1255204787988&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull UNHRC to reopen debate on Goldstone Report]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, JPost, 13 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[UN Watch]] issued a statement saying that the announced special Council's session would be a gross abuse of the procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.unwatch.org/?p=484 U.N. Rights Council Planning Emergency Session on Goldstone Report], UN Watch, 9 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October, the UNHRC endorsed the report, a move that sends it on to more powerful UN bodies for action. The resolution to the council condemned Israeli human rights violations in east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, as well as chastised Israel for failing to cooperate with the UN mission.&lt;ref name="UN rights body endorses Goldstone Report"&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3790987,00.html UN rights body endorses Goldstone Report], YNET, 16 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution text also calls on the council to endorse the Goldstone Report, however the resolution explicitly mentions only Israeli violations of international law.&lt;ref name="UNHRC endorses Goldstone's Gaza report by large majority"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1255547727737&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull UNHRC endorses Goldstone's Gaza report by large majority], JPost, 16 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 25 of the UNHRC members, mostly developing and Islamic countries, voted in favour of the resolution; the United States and 5 European countries opposed; 11 mostly European and African countries abstained, and Britain, France, and 3 other members of the 47-nation body declined to vote.&lt;ref name="UN rights body endorses Goldstone Report"/&gt; The "unbalanced focus" of the ratification was criticized by U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2113471 UN report accuses Israel of war crimes] {{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} Steven Edwards, Canwest News Service.

Israeli officials rejected the UN Human Rights Council decision to endorse the report. Israeli Arab MK Ahmed Tibi, Hamas, and Palestinian Authority representatives welcomed the vote.&lt;ref name="Israel rejects 'unjust' UN council Goldstone endorsement"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1121614.html Israel rejects 'unjust' UN council Goldstone endorsement, ''Haaretz'', 16 October 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was adopted by a vote of 25 in favour, 6 against, and 11 abstentions at a meeting held on 16 October 2009. The vote was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/256468C04BA76568C1257651004F7DA0?opendocument&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstone criticized the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution for targeting only Israel, and failing to include Hamas: "This draft resolution saddens me as it includes only allegations against Israel. There is not a single phrase condemning Hamas as we have done in the report. I hope that the council can modify the text."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2009/October/middleeast_October385.xml&amp;section=middleeast Israel faces potential embarrassment at UN], AFP (reprinted in ''Khaleej Times'' 16 October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2011, the UNHCR recommended that the General Assembly reconsider the report at its sixty-sixth session (to be held in September 2011), and urges the Assembly to submit that report to the Security Council for its consideration and appropriate action, including consideration of referral of the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/IP%20A%20HRC%20RES%2016%2032.pdf UNHCR resolution 16/32]&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was drafted by the Palestinian Authority and adopted by the Human Rights Council with 27 states voting in favour, three against, and 16 abstentions. It followed the second report of a Committee of Independent Experts, established to monitor the domestic investigations into violations committed during the conflict, which was submitted to the Human Rights Council on 18 March 2011. The report concurred with Amnesty International's assessment that – more than 18 months since the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict documented crimes under international law committed by both sides – the Israeli authorities and the Hamas de facto administration have failed to conduct investigations meeting the required international standards of independence, impartiality, thoroughness, effectiveness and promptness. The General Assembly has already twice called on the domestic authorities to conduct credible, independent investigations into the serious violations of international humanitarian and international human rights law documented by the UN Fact-Finding Mission, in resolutions adopted in November 2009 and February 2010. Those calls appear to have been ignored meaning that the General Assembly would be entitled to submit the issue to the Security Council.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/021/2011/en/ Amnesty International - UN resolution must be translated into international justice for Gaza conflict victims]&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Assembly===

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] endorsed a resolution calling for independent investigations to be conducted by Israel and Hamas on allegations of war crimes described in the Goldstone report. The resolution was passed by overwhelming numbers with 114 in favour and 18 against, and 44 abstentions. The resolution calls on the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary General]] to report to the General Assembly within three months "with a view to considering further action, if necessary, by the relevant United Nations organs and bodies", and to send the report to the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]].&lt;ref name="UN backs Gaza war crimes report"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8342915.stm UN backs Gaza war crimes report (BBC, Nov. 5, 2009)]&lt;br&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49161 POLITICS: U.N.

Most developing countries voted in favor. The countries that voted against the resolution were: Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, [[Israel]], Italy, the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Nauru]], the Netherlands, [[Palau]], [[Panama]], Poland, [[Slovakia]], The [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Ukraine]] and the United States. Some European countries, namely [[Albania]], [[Belarus]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Cyprus]], Ireland, Portugal, [[Malta]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]] and Switzerland, voted in favor of the resolution. Other European countries, including the United Kingdom, France and Spain, abstained.&lt;ref name="Breakdown of UNGA vote on Goldstone Report"&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/ga10883.doc.htm Breakdown of UNGA vote on Goldstone Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] said the vote showed that Israel has a "moral majority", adding: "[we] are pleased that 18 democratic 'premier league' states voted in line with Israel's position, while 44 South American and African states abstained".&lt;ref name=moral&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257455198182&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull FM: UNGA vote shows Israel has moral majority], ''The Jerusalem Post'' 6 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinian ambassador to the UN stated that "the General Assembly sent a powerful message", adding that if Israelis do not comply, "we will go after them."&lt;ref name="UN backs Gaza war crimes report"/&gt;

The General Assembly passed a second resolution on 26 February 2010 to call once more for credible investigations into war crimes allegations detailed in the report, giving both sides five months to report on their investigations. The resolution was passed by a vote of 98–7 with 31 abstentions, with several European countries changing their vote from against to abstaining or from abstaining to supporting relative to the first resolution. Slovak Foreign Minister [[Miroslav Lajcak]] attributed the change in voting partly to a negative reaction in Europe to an [[Assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh|assassination]] carried out in Dubai, which was largely blamed on Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8539681.stm UN renews demand for investigations into Gaza conflict (BBC, Feb. 26, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=170151 'Dubai passports impacted vote' (''The Jerusalem Post'', 4 March 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security Council===

Libya requested an emergency session of the UN Security Council on 7 October to consider the content of the report by UNHRC fact-finding mission.&lt;ref name="PA's Goldstone block linked to tape"&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/10/2009106184126258933.html# PA's Goldstone block linked to tape], Al-Jazeera, 7 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The request was rejected, but the Security Council agreed to advance its periodical meeting on the Middle East from 20 to 14 October and to discuss the war crimes allegations raised in the report.&lt;ref name="UNSC rejects Goldstone session request"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&amp;cid=1254861894322&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull UNSC rejects Goldstone session request]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. JPost, 8 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The report became the focus of the Security Council's monthly Mideast meeting on 14 October. Council diplomats say there is little chance that the Security Council will take any action, primarily because of objections by the United States, which said the report should be handled by the Human Rights Council.&lt;ref name="Palestinians urge Israeli punishment over Gaza"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/14/AR2009101402102.html Palestinians urge Israeli punishment over Gaza] ''The Washington Post'', 14 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members of the Security Council]], which wield veto powers, oppose involving the Security Council in the report.&lt;ref name="Legal row over Gaza report intensifies"/&gt;

The ICC Prosecutor could seek a determination from the Judges of the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber on whether he can open an investigation into crimes committed during the conflict on the basis of a declaration issued by the Palestinian Authority in January 2009. That declaration accepted the jurisdiction of the ICC over crimes "committed on the territory of Palestine since 1 July 2002". Legal experts dispute whether the Palestinian Authority is a "state" capable of making such a declaration under the Rome Statute. If the judges were to determine that the ICC could act on the declaration, a referral by the Security Council would not be required for the ICC to open an investigation. The ICC Prosecutor has not yet sought such a determination.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

==Israeli internal investigations==
The UNHRC Mission's report recommended that both sides in the conflict open credible independent investigations into their own actions.&lt;ref name=debates/&gt; The [[Israeli military]] opened about 100 internal investigations into its actions during the conflict, of which about 20 were criminal.&lt;ref name=debates/&gt; The Prime Minister's Office released a statement on 24 October stating that the Israel Defense Forces had investigated most of the incidents and accusations of human rights abuses mentioned in the report.&lt;ref name=team&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1RpTULAHYSAJ:www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite%3Fcid%3D1256150049412%26pagename%3DJPArticle/ShowFull+PM:+Legal+team+will+combat+Goldstone&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk PM: Legal team will combat Goldstone], ''The Jerusalem Post'' 25 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstone and human rights organizations said it was insufficient for the military to investigate itself, and the United States urged Israel to mount an independent inquiry. Goldstone also stated that an independent investigation in Israel "would really be the end of the matter, as far as Israel is concerned".&lt;ref name=debates/&gt;

In October, support grew within Israel for the launch of an independent inquiry, although the IDF and Defense Ministry argued that it would discredit the military's own internal investigations.&lt;ref name=debates&gt;Heather Sharp, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8322584.stm Israel debates response to Gaza report], BBC News 24 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; That month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the establishment of a commission headed by Justice Minister [[Yaakov Ne'eman]] that would reassemble and reevaluate material gathered by the IDF to ensure that the investigations were thorough and that no facts were covered up. According to the report, the team would not question soldiers and officers.&lt;ref name=team/&gt;

Two professors, Moshe Halbertal and Avi Sagi, called for further investigation of incidents of Israeli troops opening fire on civilians carrying white flags, the destruction of homes in the final days of the operation and the destruction of power stations and water facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1126780.html Authors of IDF ethics code demand Gaza war probe (''Haaretz'')&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Israeli Supreme Court]] President [[Aharon Barak]] advised the Attorney General to establish a state committee endowed with investigative and subpoena powers to look into the claims raised by the Goldstone report.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt; The chief legal officer of the IDF, Pnina Sharvit-Baruch, advocated establishing a commission of inquiry to respond to the Goldstone report, which she described as "very, very damaging" to Israel's international standing. She argued that an inquiry was needed to provide Israel with arguments that it had complied with the report's recommendations, rather than to uncover actual war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1147186.html IDF legal official: Israel should probe Goldstone Gaza report (''Haaretz'', 3 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the Israeli military completed a rebuttal to the Goldstone report. The IDF affirmed that Gaza's sole flour mill was hit by tank shells in the course of a firefight with Hamas and that it was a legitimate military target because Hamas fighters were allegedly in its vicinity.&lt;ref name="GuardianBomb" /&gt; The Goldstone Report informed that the mill had been hit by an aircraft bomb. Moreover, the Israeli military denied that the mill was a pre-planned target.&lt;ref name="GuardianBomb" /&gt; (Photographs taken by a UN team to which ''The Guardian'' had access reportedly show, however, that the remains of a 500-pound Mk82 aircraft-dropped bomb were found in the midst of the mill's ruins.&lt;ref name="GuardianBomb"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/01/gaza-war-report-accuses-israel UN find challenges Israeli version of attack on civilian building in Gaza war (''The Guardian'', 1 February 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;) Israel said it would present UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon with its response to the Goldstone report by 28 January to meet the 5 February deadline set by the UN General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1263147961477&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Israel to present response to Goldstone]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 23 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Defense Minister Ehud Barak and IDF Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen.

In January 2010, eight human rights organizations in Israel reissued a call to the government to establish an independent and impartial investigation.&lt;ref name="ihr-2010-01-26"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/english/press_releases/20100126.asp|title=Human rights community to Israeli Prime Minister: Time is running out.

In April 2010, Human Rights Watch released a 62-page report on Israels and Hamas' investigations. Concerning Israel, HRW reported that Israel had until that point failed to conduct a credible and independent investigation into the alleged war crimes in Gaza. "Israel's investigations into serious laws-of-war violations by its forces during last year's Gaza war lack thoroughness and credibility," HRW said in a release.&lt;ref name="HRWApril11"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/04/09/israelgaza-gaza-war-victims-shortchanged-justice Israel/Gaza: Gaza War Victims Shortchanged on Justice (11 April 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010 Israel released second response to the report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3915978,00.html
&lt;/ref&gt; Several soldiers were charged with misconduct, including manslaughter charges against a soldier for shooting at Palestinian women carrying white flags, as well as charges against use of a boy as a human shield. Brigadier General [[Eyal Eisenberg]] and Colonel Ilan Malca were reprimanded for authorizing an artillery attack that hit a UN compound.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/7875702/Israeli-soldier-shot-two-women-as-they-waved-white-flag.html Israeli soldier 'shot two women as they waved white flag' (''The Telegraph'', 6 July 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hamas claims==
Addressing the report's allegations, initially a Hamas spokesman in Gaza said that the rockets fired at Israel were in self-defense, and were not intended to target civilians: "We were targeting military bases, but the primitive weapons make mistakes."&lt;ref name="Inquiry Finds Gaza War Crimes From Both Sides"/&gt; In what the Associated Press called "a rare deviation from Hamas' violent ideology", Hamas also initially said it regretted killing Israeli civilians. Ahmed Assaf, a spokesman for the rival Palestinian party [[Fatah]], said he was "stunned" at the apology, and said Hamas should instead apologize rather to fellow Palestinians for the deaths and injuries Hamas caused during its [[Fatah-Hamas conflict|violent struggle with Fatah]] over control in Gaza in 2007, which he called a "bloody coup".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6150Z720100206 Rivals slam Hamas for "apology" to Israelis], Reuters 02-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

HRW rejected Hamas's claim: &lt;blockquote&gt;Hamas' claim that rockets were intended to hit Israeli military targets and only accidentally harmed civilians is belied by the facts. Civilians were the target, deliberately targeting civilians is a war crime.&lt;/blockquote&gt; HRW deputy Middle East director [[Joe Stork]] stated: "Hamas can spin the story and deny the evidence, but hundreds of rockets rained down on civilian areas in Israel where no military installations were located."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=259700 Hamas: Israel manipulating evidence of war crimes], Ma'an News Agency 7 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8484947.stm Human Rights Watch rejects Hamas' claims on rockets], BBC 28 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] noted, "Hamas fired hundreds of rockets toward Israeli towns and cities during the fighting, killing three Israeli civilians."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_ISRAEL_PALESTINIANS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2010-01-28-13-17-57 Rights group faults Israel's Gaza war crimes probe], AP 28 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Several days later, Hamas retracted its apology, stating that its statement had been incorrectly interpreted. According to Gaza analyst Naji Sharrab, Hamas's retraction was likely a result of public pressure on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. "They are addressing two different audiences," Sharrab said of Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5h_KtGKVnFYIKK2zNaY7kpOhLt5IQ https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5h_KtGKVnFYIKK2zNaY7kpOhLt5IQ], Associated Press 02-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, HRW reported that Hamas had not conducted any credible investigations at all. "Hamas has punished no one for ordering or carrying out hundreds of deliberate or indiscriminate rocket attacks into Israeli cities and towns," HRW said in a release.&lt;ref name="HRWApril11"/&gt;

==UN Panel assessment==
In September 2010, A [[UN Human Rights Council]] panel said Israel and Hamas had failed to conduct credible and adequate investigations into the war crimes allegations contained in the Goldstone report. The panel said Israel only investigated low-ranking officials and failed to investigate the role of "officials at the highest levels", while Hamas was criticised for not making serious efforts to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11384476 UN faults Israeli, Hamas probes into Gaza conflict (BBC, Sept. 21, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future ramifications==
[[File:Mustafa barghouthi.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Mustafa Barghouti]], Palestinian democracy activist]]
It has been suggested by some states, individuals, organisations and media outlets that the Goldstone report may have ramifications for other present and future conflicts, particularly conflicts between states and [[non-state actors]] such as [[terrorist organisations]].

Israel has said that the Goldstone report poses a challenge to the ability of states to defend themselves against terrorism, and warned that similar allegations could be made against other militaries fighting in comparable circumstances. In a statement released by Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Israel claims that the report "[t]ies the hands of democratic countries fighting terror worldwide" and "[p]romotes criminal proceedings against forces confronting terrorism in foreign states".&lt;ref name="Goldstone Fact-Finding Report: A challenge to democracies fighting terror"&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Hamas+war+against+Israel/Goldstone+Fact-Finding_Report_Challenge_democracies_fighting+_error.htm Goldstone Fact-Finding Report: A challenge to democracies fighting terror], Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs 17 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Following statements by the United Kingdom's Ambassador to Israel calling upon Israel to investigate the allegations contained in the report, Israeli officials reportedly responded that "[i]f a precedent is set of Israelis being prosecuted for acts during the Gaza war, Britons could also be placed in the dock for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan."&lt;ref name="Israeli officials warn against support for UN report"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israeli-officials-warn-against-support-for-un-report-1801236.html Israeli officials warn against support for UN report], ''The Independent'' 11 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], in an interview broadcast on Israel's Channel 10, said, "... countries that are fighting terrorism must understand that this report hurts not only us but them as well. It hurts peace. It hurts security."&lt;ref name="Goldstone Report: Interviews with PM Netanyahu on Israeli television"&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Speeches+by+Israeli+leaders/2009/Goldstone_Report_Interviews_PM_Netanyahu_17-Sep-2009 Goldstone Report: Interviews with PM Netanyahu on Israeli television], Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs 17 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion and editorial pieces expressing similar views have been published in a variety of newspapers and media outlets in the U.S. and Israel, some claiming that American and European military forces could be subject to similar criticism for their operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Britain's Terror Double Take"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704322004574475560854872736 Britain's Terror Double Take], ''The Wall Street Journal'' 16 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The U.N. sides with terrorists"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/oct/19/the-un-sides-with-terrorists/ The U.N. sides with terrorists], ''The Washington Times'' 19 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN report a victory for terror"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/09/24/un_report_a_victory_for_terror/ UN report a victory for terror], ''The Boston Globe'' 24 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. Is "&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-spine/us-concerned-about-the-goldstone-report-gaza-maybe-washington-should-turn-its-eyes-af U.S. Is "Concerned" About the Goldstone Report on Gaza; Maybe Washington Should Turn Its Eyes on Afghanistan and Itself,].

An article published by the [[BBC]] said that the fact that the Goldstone report might have consequences for countries fighting terrorists that hide among civilians "may have been a consideration for the U.S. and some [[NATO]] countries that either voted against the UN resolution or abstained [at the General Assembly vote]". The article concludes by stating that human rights groups note that the report has reinforced efforts to tackle issues of impunity and lack of accountability for war crimes.&lt;ref name="Legal row over Gaza report intensifies"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8347861.stm Legal row over Gaza report intensifies], BBC News 6 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview conducted by [[Al-Jazeera]], American Professor of law and former Lieutenant Colonel in the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] [[Amos N. Guiora]] and Palestinian politician [[Mustafa Barghouti]] both stated that they believed that the Goldstone report would have massive ramifications for the United States and other countries involved in military conflicts. According to Guiora the report "[minimizes] the nation-state's right to self-defence" and "raises extraordinarily important questions for American policymakers and for American commanders presently engaged in Afghanistan and Iraq and that same question is true with respect to other armies".&lt;ref name="aljazeera interview"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vZeBbLeo-M&amp;feature=player_embedded Riz Khan – The Goldstone report dispute – 4 Nov 09 – Part 1], Al-Jazeera 4 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 2010, in testimony before the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, U.S. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] "admitted that the report was problematic for the United States and other countries, which face the same type of war on terrorism coming out of populated areas". She also warned that if the Goldstone report were to set the international standards, the U.S. and many other countries might be accused of war crimes for their military operations.&lt;ref name = "Clinton: Goldstone problematic for other countries"&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3854841,00.html Clinton: Goldstone problematic for other countries], Ynetnews 26 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the report, and following receipt of material from South African, [[International Criminal Court]] prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo stated he was considering opening an investigation into whether Lt. Col. David Benjamin, an IDF reserve officer, allowed war crimes to be committed during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]]. Benjamin served in the Military Advocate General's international law department, but was actually abroad for most of the period of the conflict and already retired from active duty. Because of his dual Israeli-South African citizenship, he is according to Moreno Ocampo within the jurisdiction of the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The European Initiative, a pro-Israeli group, lodged an itemized legal complaint with the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office and demanded that the top Hamas leadership in Gaza and Damascus be prosecuted for war crimes. The plaintiffs are Israelis who hold Belgian citizenship and live in the Gaza periphery communities that have been targeted by rockets. The suit is based on the Goldstone Report, as well as on reports by B'Tselem and Amnesty International.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coteret.com/2009/12/24/european-pro-israel-group-moves-in-support-of-universal-jurisdiction-files-belgian-suit-based-on-goldstone-report/ The foreign passports legion], Yehuda Shohat, Yediot, 24 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1137413.html Gaza rocket victims to Belgium: Try Hamas chiefs for war crimes, ''Haaretz'', 24 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, wrote that the even-handed and impartial approach of the team led by Goldstone is indispensable in preventing future human-rights violations and in establishing a solid base for peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/navi-pillay/the-vital-importance-of-e_b_303954.html The Vital Importance of Ending Impunity in Israel and Palestine (The Huffington Post, Sept. 30, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Goldstone reappraisal|Goldstone recantation}}Goldstone's retraction of claim Israel targeted civilians==

On 1 April 2011, Goldstone published a piece in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' titled 'Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes'. Goldstone noted that the subsequent investigations by Israel and recognized in the U.N. committee's report "indicate that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy" while "the crimes allegedly committed by Hamas were intentional goes without saying." The other principal authors of the UN report, [[Hina Jilani]], [[Christine Chinkin]] and [[Desmond Travers]], have rejected Goldstone's reassessment arguing that there is "no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in anyway change the context, findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the Gaza conflict".&lt;ref name="afp1404"/&gt;&lt;ref name="g2011-04-14"/&gt;  According to journalist Connie Bruck, writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]', "Goldstone came under such pressure that threats were made to ban him from his grandson’s bar mitzvah at a Johannesburg synagogue."&lt;ref name=bruck&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruck|first1=Connie|title=Friends of Israel|journal=The New Yorker|date=1 September 2014|pages=50–63|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/friends-israel|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goldstone's statement===
Goldstone further expressed regret "that our fact-finding mission did not have such evidence explaining the circumstances in which we said civilians in Gaza were targeted, because it probably would have influenced our findings about intentionality and war crimes". Goldstone's revised view concerned the intentional targeting of civilians, not other war crimes alleged in the report to have been committed by Israel. Such other crimes included causing civilian casualties by using a disproportionate level of force and attacks on buildings concerning which there was no indication they were legitimate military targets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/04/201144185658205605.html Goldstone recants, but how much is changed? (Al Jazeera, 05 Apr 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstone added: "That comparatively few Israelis have been killed by the unlawful rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza in no way minimizes the criminality. The U.N. Human Rights Council should condemn these heinous acts in the strongest terms."

Goldstone wrote that "If I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document." He said that the lack of Israeli cooperation had meant that no Israeli officers were interviewed during the writing of the report. In hindsight, incidents that had been interpreted as the deliberate targeting of civilians may have had other explanations, such as poor intelligence information. Goldstone also praised Israel for investigating claims of war crimes while faulting Hamas for its failure to launch any investigations of its own forces. Goldstone commended Israel for responding to his report by revising military procedures e.g. to discontinue the use of white phosphorus (including as a smokescreen) in or near civilian areas.&lt;ref name="WP0401"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html |title=Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes' |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=1 April 2011 |author=Richard Goldstone |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstone also expressed that he initially hoped the "inquiry into all aspects of the Gaza conflict would begin a new era of evenhandedness at the U.N. Human Rights Council, whose history of bias against Israel cannot be doubted".&lt;ref name="WP0401" /&gt;

===Reactions===
Response in Israel to Goldstone's reappraisal of the report was harsh with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu releasing a statement saying that the report should be thrown "into the dustbin of history" and ''Jerusalem Post'' editor David Horovitz writing that Goldstone had "produced a report that has caused such irreversible damage to Israel's good name" that the very least that Goldstone now owes Israel "is to work unstintingly from now on to try to undo the damage he has caused".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=214864 PM: Throw Goldstone Report into dustbin of history]| By TOVAH LAZAROFF, YAAKOV KATZ | ''Jerusalem Post''| 04/02/2011&lt;/ref&gt; UN human rights council spokesman Cedric Sapey stated "The UN will not revoke a report on the basis of an article in a newspaper. The views Mr Goldstone expressed are his own personal views." Sapey explained "A move to change or withdraw the report would either require a formal written complaint from Goldstone, backed unanimously by his three fellow authors, or a vote by the UN general assembly or the human rights council."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/05/goldstone-gaza-report-stands-un | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Ed | last1=Pilkington | first2=Conal | last2=Urquhart | title=Gaza,Israel (News),Middle East (News),Palestinian territories (News),World news,Law,War crimes,Human rights | date=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri dismissed Goldstone's remarks saying, "his retreat does not change the fact war crimes had been committed against 1.5 million people in Gaza," while Palestinian Foreign Minister [[Riyad al-Maliki]] said Goldstone's comments did not change a thing and that "The report was as clear as the crimes that Israel committed during the war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2011/04/02/world/middleeast/international-us-israel-un-gaza.html?scp=1&amp;sq=goldstone&amp;st=nyt | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hina Jilani, one of the four writers of the "Goldstone Report", noted when asked if the report should allegedly be changed: "Absolutely not; no process or acceptable procedure would invalidate the UN Report; if it does happen, it would be seen as a 'suspect move'."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pakistantimes.net/pt/detail.php?newsId=20465 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314122136/http://www.pakistantimes.net/pt/detail.php?newsId=20465 |date=14 March 2012 }} UN report on Gaza conflict stands unchanged: Hina Jilani (''Pakistan Times'', 6 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/world/middleeast/06goldstone.html?_r=1&amp;ref=middleeast Head of Gaza Inquiry Is Said to Plan Israel Trip (''The New York Times'', 5 April 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; Also another of the four co-writers, Irish international criminal investigations expert Desmond Travers, noted: 'the tenor of the report in its entirety, in my opinion, stands'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/un-council-goldstone-regret-not-enough-to-rescind-gaza-war-report-1.354070 UN council: Goldstone regret not enough to rescind Gaza war report (''Haaretz'', 5 April 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; Also Goldstone maintained that, although the one correction should be made, he had "no reason to believe any part of the report needs to be reconsidered at this time" and that he didn't plan to pursue nullifying the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2014686085_apmlisraelunreport.html?syndication=rss Goldstone won't seek Gaza report nullification (Associated Press, 6 April 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights organizations said that much of the report remained valid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/world/middleeast/04goldstone.html?_r=1&amp;ref=middleeast Israel Grapples With Retraction on U.N. Report (''The New York Times'', 3 April 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Jewish Committee]] (AJC) Executive Director, David Harris, said that "Judge Goldstone should apologize to the State of Israel for the accusations of intentionally targeting civilians, which he now admits were unfounded. He should present his updated conclusions to the UN Human Rights Council, as well as to the General Assembly, which endorsed the skewed report, and press for its rejection."&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=214926&amp;R=R4 US Jewish groups urge Goldstone to retract report]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[NGO Monitor]] President Professor [[Gerald Steinberg]] said "with Goldstone's admission that 'our fact-finding mission had no evidence' and that 'civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy,' the politicized NGOs that supplied these allegations have been exposed again as biased and lacking credibility. As NGO Monitor demonstrated&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/goldstone_and_ngos Goldstone and NGOs]&lt;/ref&gt; when the report was released, the so-called 'evidence' provided by these groups was at the core of the political war against Israel."&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

===Statement issued by other members of UN mission===
On 14 April 2011, the other three authors of the Goldstone report released a statement regarding Goldstones article in ''The Washington Post''. Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers claimed, "in recent days some articles and comments appearing in the press with respect to the report of the United Nations (UN) fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict of 2008–2009 have misrepresented facts in an attempt to delegitimise the findings of this report and to cast doubts on its credibility."

The 3 coauthors of the report wanted to address the "aspersions cast on the findings of the report and challenge them. Members of the mission, signatories to this statement, find it necessary to dispel any impression that subsequent developments have rendered any part of the mission's report unsubstantiated, erroneous or inaccurate".

Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers claimed there is "no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in any way change the context, findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the Gaza conflict. Indeed, there is no UN procedure or precedent to that effect".

They stated, "The report of the fact-finding mission contains the conclusions made after diligent, independent and objective consideration of the information related to the events within our mandate, and careful assessment of its reliability and credibility. We firmly stand by these conclusions."

They concluded that Israel and Hamas have yet to establish a convincing basis for any claims that contradict the findings of the mission's report contradicting Goldstones claims.

They pointed out, "many of those calling for the nullification of our report imply that the final report by the follow-up committee's two members, Judge Mary McGowan Davis and Judge Lennart Aspergren, presented to the human rights council in March 2011, somehow contradicts the fact-finding mission's report or invalidates it. In the light of the observations of this committee such claims are completely misplaced, and a clear distortion of their findings".

They criticized the findings of the Israeli inquiries. "The committee's report states that, according to available information, Israel has conducted some 400 command investigations into allegations by the fact-finding mission and other organisations. Command investigations are operational, not legal, inquiries and are conducted by personnel from the same command structure as those under investigation. Out of these, the committee reports that 52 criminal investigations into allegations of wrongdoings have been opened. Of these, three have been submitted for prosecution, with two of them resulting in convictions (one for theft of a credit card, resulting in a sentence of seven months' imprisonment, and another for using a Palestinian child as a human shield, which resulted in a suspended sentence of three months). The third case, related to allegations of deliberate targeting of an individual waving a white flag, is still ongoing."

"The committee has expressed serious concerns about the late start and slow pace of the proceedings, their insufficient transparency and the participation of victims and witnesses. Out of the 36 incidents relating to Gaza described in the fact-finding mission report, more than one third remain unresolved or without a clear status over two years after the conflict. The committee concluded that the slow progress could seriously impair the effectiveness of the investigations and prospects of achieving justice and accountability. Therefore, the mechanisms that are being used by the Israeli authorities to investigate the incidents are proving inadequate to genuinely ascertain the facts and any ensuing legal responsibility."

The authors also stated that "In addition, with regard to the issue of the policies guiding Operation Cast Lead, the committee states that there is "no indication that Israel has opened investigations into the actions of those who designed, planned, ordered and oversaw Operation Cast Lead". In other words, one of the most serious allegations about the conduct of Israel's military operations remains completely unaddressed."

They also criticized Hamas "We regret that no domestic investigations at all have been started into any of the allegations of international crimes committed by members of Palestinian armed groups in Gaza which have fired thousands of rockets into southern Israel. The committee observes the same in its report."

Their statement concluded with "We consider that calls to reconsider or even retract the report, as well as attempts at misrepresenting its nature and purpose, disregard the right of victims, Palestinian and Israeli, to truth and justice. They also ignore the responsibility of the relevant parties under international law to conduct prompt, thorough, effective and independent investigations. We regret the personal attacks and the extraordinary pressure placed on members of the fact-finding mission since we began our work in May 2009. This campaign has been clearly aimed at undermining the integrity of the report and its authors. Had we given in to pressures from any quarter to sanitise our conclusions, we would be doing a serious injustice to the hundreds of innocent civilians killed during the Gaza conflict, the thousands injured, and the hundreds of thousands whose lives continue to be deeply affected by the conflict and the blockade.

"The report has triggered a process that is still under way and should continue until justice is done and respect for international human rights and humanitarian law by everyone is ensured."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/14/goldstone-report-statement-un-gaza Goldstone report: Statement issued by members of UN mission on Gaza war (''The Guardian'', 14 April 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[United Nations]] [[List of UN Security Council Resolutions|Security Council Resolution]] 234''', was adopted on June 7, 1967, after its appeal to the governments concerned to immediately cease all military activities in the [[Near East]] failed. The Council, concerned with the possibility of a broader conflict, demanded that the governments involved discontinue all military activities by 20:00 GMT on June 7, 1967.  The Council also requested that the Secretary-General keep them promptly and currently informed on the situation.

The meeting was called by the [[Soviet Union]] and the resolution passed unanimously. [[Jordan]] and [[Israel]] accepted the resolution, provided other parties accepted as well. The following day the [[United Arab Republic]] also accepted the ceasefire solution, on condition of reciprocity.&lt;ref name="well"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellens|first=Karen|author2=T.M.C.

{{Violence against women}}

'''Violence against women''' ('''VAW'''), also known as '''gender-based violence'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Russo | first1 = Nancy Felipe | last2 = Pirlott | first2 = Angela | title = Gender-based violence: concepts, methods, and findings | journal = [[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |issue=Violence and Exploitation Against Women and Girls | volume = 1087 | pages = 178&amp;ndash;205 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] and [[Oxfam]] | doi = 10.1196/annals.1385.024 | date = November 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1385.024 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''sexual and gender-based violence''' ('''SGBV''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/SGBV/en/ Sexual and Gender-based Violence] (WHO)&lt;/ref&gt; is, collectively, violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against [[woman|women]] and girls. Sometimes considered a [[hate crime]],&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] states, "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women" and "violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm |title=A/RES/48/104 - Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kofi Annan]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], declared in a 2006 report posted on the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) website:&lt;blockquote&gt;Violence against women and girls is a problem of [[pandemic]] proportions. At least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime with the abuser usually someone known to her.&lt;ref name="Moradian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.tolerancy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=176:2009-09-15-08-37-55&amp;catid=43:events-a-reports&amp;Itemid=90 |title=Domestic Violence against Single and Married Women in Iranian Society |last=Moradian |first=Azad |work=Tolerancy.org |publisher=[[The Chicago School of Professional Psychology]] |date=10 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425230632/http://en.tolerancy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=176%3A2009-09-15-08-37-55&amp;catid=43%3Aevents-a-reports&amp;Itemid=90 |archivedate=25 April 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Violence against women can fit into several broad categories. These include violence carried out by "individuals" as well as "states". Some of the forms of violence perpetrated by individuals are: [[rape]], [[domestic violence]], [[sexual harassment]], [[reproductive coercion]], [[female infanticide]], [[sex selective abortion|prenatal sex selection]], [[obstetric violence]], and [[mob violence]]; as well as harmful customary or traditional practices such as [[honor killings]], [[dowry death|dowry violence]], [[female genital mutilation]], [[marriage by abduction]] and [[forced marriage]]. Some forms of violence are perpetrated or condoned by the state such as [[war rape]]; [[sexual violence]] and [[sexual slavery]] during conflict; [[forced sterilization]]; [[forced abortion]]; violence by the police and authoritative personnel; [[stoning]] and [[flogging]]. Many forms of VAW, such as [[trafficking in women]] and [[forced prostitution]] are often perpetrated by organized criminal networks.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last = Prügl | first = Elisabeth (Director) | title = Violence Against Women. Gender and International Affairs Class 2013. Lecture conducted from [[The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] (IHEID) | location = Geneva, Switzerland | date = 25 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), in its research on VAW, has analyzed and categorized the different forms of VAW occurring through all stages of life from before birth to old age.&lt;ref name="WHO_VAW"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Violence against women: Definition and scope of the problem, 1, 1-3 | url = http://www.who.int/gender/violence/v4.pdf | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | date = July 1997 | access-date = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been a trend of approaching VAW at an international level, through instruments such as conventions; or, in the [[European Union]], through [[Directive (European Union)|directive]]s, such as the directive against [[sexual harassment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF |format=pdf | date = September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the directive against [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF |format=pdf |title= Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JH |work=Official Journal of the European Union |accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, provides the following definition of violence against women:&lt;ref name="COE 210"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/210 |title=Details of Treaty No.210: Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence |publisher=Council of Europe |date= |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|"violence against women" is understood as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women and shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life}}

Although the 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) includes VAW in its General Recommendations 12 and 19,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/ |title=General recommendations adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |publisher=United Nations |date=31 December 2003 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] mentions VAW at paragraph 18,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=12 July 1993 |url=http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=459d17822&amp;toid=459b17a82&amp;docid=3ae6b39ec&amp;skip=O |title=Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action |publisher=UN General Assembly |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the 1993 [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution on the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]], which became the first international instrument to explicitly define VAW and elaborate on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/global-norms-and-standards |title=What We Do: Ending Violence against Women: Global Norms and Standards |publisher=UN Women |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions of VAW are provided by the 1994 ''Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html |title=Inter-American Convention On The Prevention, Punishment And Eradication Of Violence Against Women "Convention Of Belem Do Para" |publisher=Organization of American States |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 2003 [[Maputo Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/files/instruments/women-protocol/achpr_instr_proto_women_eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa |publisher=African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the term ''gender-based violence'' refers to "any acts or threats of acts intended to hurt or make women suffer physically, sexually or psychologically, and which affect women because they are women or affect women disproportionately".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Richters | first = J.M. Annemiek | title = Women, culture and violence: a development, health and human rights issue | publisher = Women and Autonomy Centre (VENA), Leiden University | location = Leiden, The Netherlands | year = 1994 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KvbtAAAAMAAJ | oclc = 905570045 | isbn = 9789072631374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of gender-based violence is most often "used interchangeably with violence against women",&lt;ref name="Krantz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krantz | first1 = Gunilla | last2 = Garcia-Moreno | first2 = Claudia | title = Violence against women | journal = [[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]] | volume = 59 | issue = 10 | pages = 818&amp;ndash;821 | publisher = [[BMJ Group]] | doi = 10.1136/jech.2004.022756 | jstor = 25570854 | pmid = 16166351 | pmc = 1732916 | date = October 2005 | url = https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.2004.022756 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some articles on VAW reiterate these conceptions by suggesting that men are the main perpetrators of this violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sen | first = Purna | title = Development practice and violence against women | journal = [[Gender &amp; Development]], special issue: Violence Against Women | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 7&amp;ndash;16 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] and [[Oxfam]] | doi = 10.1080/741922827 | jstor = 4030497 | date = November 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/741922827 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the definition stated by the 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women also supported the notion that violence is rooted in the inequality between men and women when the term violence is used together with the term 'gender-based.'&lt;ref name="Krantz"/&gt;

In ''Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence'', the Council of Europe stipulated that VAW "includes, but is not limited to, the following":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=30 April 2002 |url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383 |format=PDF |title=Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence |publisher=Council of Europe Committee of Ministers |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:a. violence occurring in the family or domestic unit, including, ''inter alia'', physical and mental aggression, emotional and psychological abuse, rape and sexual abuse, incest, rape between spouses, regular or occasional partners and cohabitants, crimes committed in the name of honour, female genital and sexual mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, such as forced marriages;

:b. violence occurring within the general community, including, ''inter alia'', rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in institutions or elsewhere trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation and economic exploitation and sex tourism;

:c. violence perpetrated or condoned by the state or its officials;

:d. violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict, in particular the taking of hostages, forced displacement, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and economic exploitation.

These definitions of VAW as being gender-based are seen by some to be unsatisfactory and problematic. These definitions are conceptualized in an understanding of society as patriarchal, signifying unequal relations between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ertürk | first = Yakin | title = Towards a post-patriarchal gender order: confronting the universality and the particularity of violence against women | journal = Sociologisk Forskning | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 61&amp;ndash;70 | publisher = Sveriges Sociologförbund [Swedish Sociological Association] | jstor = 20853687 | date = 2009 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of such definitions argue that the definitions disregard violence against men and that the term ''[[gender]]'', as used in ''gender based violence'', only refers to women. Other critics argue that employing the term ''gender'' in this particular way may introduce notions of inferiority and subordination for femininity and superiority for masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Visaria | first = Leela | title = Violence against women: a field study | journal = [[Economic and Political Weekly]] | volume = 35 | issue = 20 | pages = 1742&amp;ndash;1751 | publisher = Sameeksha Trust, Mumbai, India | jstor = 4409296 | date = 13 May 2000 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Michau | first = Lori | title = Approaching old problems in new ways: community mobilisation as a primary prevention strategy to combat violence against women | journal = [[Gender &amp; Development]], special issue: Gender-based Violence | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 95&amp;ndash;109 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] and [[Oxfam]] | doi = 10.1080/13552070601179144 | jstor = 20461184 | date = March 2007 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/13552070601179144 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no widely accepted current definition that covers all the dimensions of gender-based violence rather than the one for women that tends to reproduce the concept of binary oppositions: masculinity versus femininity.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. 2013"/&gt;

The history of violence against women remains vague in scientific literature. This is in part because many kinds of violence against women (specifically rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence) are under-reported, often due to societal norms, taboos, stigma, and the sensitive nature of the subject.&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watts | first1 = Charlotte | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Cathy | title = Violence against women: global scope and magnitude | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 359 | issue = 9313 | pages = 1232&amp;ndash;1237 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | pmid = 11955557 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08221-1 | date = 6 April 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08221-1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely recognized that even today, a lack of reliable and continuous data is an obstacle to forming a clear picture of violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women"&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations |title=In-depth study on all forms of violence against women.

Although the history of violence against women is difficult to track, it is clear that much of the violence was accepted, condoned and even legally sanctioned.&lt;ref name="Film script"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ireland|first=Patricia | title=No Safe Place: Violence Against Women (script) |url=https://www.pbs.org/kued/nosafeplace/script/script.html|publisher=[[PBS]] documentary |date =1996|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include that Roman law gave men the right to chastise their wives, even to the point of death,&lt;ref name="Roman Law"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stedman | first = Berne | title = Right of husband to chastise wife | journal = [[Virginia Law Review|The Virginia Law Register]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 241&amp;ndash;248 | publisher = [[University of Virginia School of Law]] | doi = 10.2307/1106112 | jstor = 1106112 | date = August 1917 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1106112 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Also available at [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/valrgn3&amp;div=35&amp;id=&amp;page= HeinOnline].

The history of violence against women is closely related to the historical view of women as property and a gender role of subservience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Toren | first = Christina | chapter = Transforming love: representing Fijian hierarchy | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KGXezlZnjF8C&amp;pg=PA36 | editor-last1 = Harvey | editor-first1 = Penelope | editor-last2= Gow | editor-first2 = Peter  | title = Sex and violence: issues in representation and experience | pages = 18&amp;ndash;39 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780415057349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations of [[patriarchy]] and an overall world system or status quo in which gender inequalities exist and are perpetuated are cited to explain the scope and history of violence against women.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993) states, "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations | title = Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women | id = A/RES/48/104 | url = https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm | publisher = United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UNFPA | author-link = United Nations Population Fund | title = Addressing gender-based violence: advancing human rights | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141021001255/http://www.unfpa.org/rights/violence.htm | archive-date = 21 October 2014 | url = http://www.unfpa.org/rights/violence.htm | publisher = [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN, "there is no region of the world, no country and no culture in which women's freedom from violence has been secured."&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; Several forms of violence are more prevalent in certain parts of the world, often in [[developing countries]]. For example, [[dowry death|dowry violence]] and [[bride burning]] is associated with [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Nepal]]. [[Acid throwing]] is also associated with these countries, as well as in [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Cambodia]]. [[Honor killing]] is associated with the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]]. [[Female genital mutilation]] is found mostly in [[Africa]], and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and some other parts of Asia. [[Marriage by abduction]] is found in [[Ethiopia]], [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]. Abuse related to payment of [[bride price]] (such as violence, trafficking and forced marriage) is linked to parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania.

Certain regions are no longer associated with a specific form of violence, but such violence was common until quite recently in those places; this is true of honor-based crimes in Southern/Mediterranean Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirti | first1 = Anand | last2 = Kumar | first2 = Prateek | last3 = Yadav | first3 = Rachana | title = The face of honour based crimes: global concerns and solutions | journal = International Journal of Criminal Justice Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 343&amp;ndash;357 | publisher = South Asian Society of Criminology &amp; Victimology (SASCV) | date = 2011 | url = http://www.sascv.org/ijcjs/pdfs/kirtietalicjs2011i&amp;iind.pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[Italy]], before 1981, the Criminal Code provided for mitigating circumstances in case of a killing of a woman or her sexual partner for reasons related to honor, providing for a reduced sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Barazzetti | first1 = Donatella | last2 = Garreffa | first2 = Franca | last3 = Marsico | first3 = Rosaria | title = Daphne Project "Proposing new indicators: measuring violence's effects, GVEI (Gender Violence Effects Indicators)" | url = http://www.surt.org/gvei/docs/national_report_italy.pdf | publisher = Centre Women’s Studies “Milly Villa”, [[University of Calabria]] | location = Rende, Italy | date = July 2007 | quote = Before 1981, Art. 587 read: He who causes the death of a spouse, daughter, or sister upon discovering her in illegitimate carnal relations and in the heat of passion caused by the offence to his honour or that of his family will be sentenced to three to seven years.

Invoking culture to explain particular forms of violence against women risks appearing to legitimize them. There is also debate and controversy about the ways in which cultural traditions, local customs and social expectations, as well as various interpretations of religion, interact with abusive practices.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Narayan | first = Uma | chapter = Cross‐cultural connections, border‐crossings, and "Death by Culture": thinking about dowry-murders in India and domestic‐violence murders in the United States | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lzQ49LnmL_cC&amp;pg=PA81 | editor-last = Narayan | editor-first = Uma | title = Dislocating cultures: identities, traditions, and Third-World feminism | pages = 81&amp;ndash;118 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415914192 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, cultural justifications for certain violent acts against women are asserted by some states and social groups within many countries claiming to defend their traditions. These justifications are questionable precisely because the defenses are generally voiced by political leaders or traditional authorities, not by those actually affected.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; The need for sensitivity and respect of culture is an element that cannot be ignored either; thus a sensitive debate has ensued and is ongoing.

There has also been a history of recognizing the harmful effects of this violence. In the 1870s, courts in the United States stopped recognizing the common-law principle that a husband had the right to "physically chastise an errant wife".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Calvert | first = Robert | chapter = Criminal and civil liability in husband-wife assaults | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fCpHAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Steinmetz | editor-first1 = Suzanne | editor-last2 = Straus | editor-first2 = Murray A. | author-link2 = Murray A.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, and in particular since the 1990s, there has been increased activity on both the national and international levels to research, raise awareness and advocate for the prevention of all kinds of violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; Most often, violence against women has been framed as a health issue, and also as a violation of human rights. A study in 2002 estimated that at least one in five women in the world had been physically or sexually abused by a man sometime in their lives, and "gender-based violence accounts for as much death and ill-health in women aged 15–44 years as cancer, and is a greater cause of ill-health than malaria and traffic accidents combined."&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt;

Certain characteristics of violence against women have emerged from the research. For example, acts of violence against women are often not unique episodes, but are ongoing over time. More often than not, the violence is perpetrated by someone the woman knows, not by a stranger.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt; The research seems to provide convincing evidence that violence against women is a severe and pervasive problem the world over, with devastating effects on the health and well-being of women and children.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;

===Milestones===
Some of the most important milestones on the international level for the prevention of violence against women include:

*The 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), which recognizes violence as a part of discrimination against women in recommendations 12 and 19.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global norms and standards: Ending violence against women|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/global-norms-and-standards|publisher=[[UN Women]]|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1993 [[World Conference on Human Rights]], which recognized violence against women as a human rights violation, and which contributed to the following UN declaration.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards" /&gt;
*The 1993 UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] was the first international instrument explicitly defining and addressing violence against women. This document specifically refers to the historically forever-present nature of gender inequalities in understanding violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt; (Include current 2nd paragraph here). This Declaration, as well as the World Conference of the same year, is often viewed as a "turning point" at which the consideration of violence against women by the international community began to be taken much more seriously, and after which more countries mobilized around this problem.&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Venis | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Horton | first2 = Richard | title = Violence against women: a global burden | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 359 | issue = 9313 | page = 1172 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | pmid = 11955533 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08251-X | date = 6 April 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08251-X | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO Multicountry Study"&gt;{{cite book | last = Garcia-Moreno | first = Claudia | title = WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women: initial results on prevalence, health outcomes and women's responses | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2005 | url = http://cdrwww.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/Introduction-Chapter1-Chapter2.pdf | isbn = 9789241593588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]], linking violence against women to reproductive health and rights, and also providing recommendations to governments on how to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt;
*In 1996, the [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) declared violence a major public health issue, and included in the subtypes recognized were intimate partner violence and sexual violence, two kinds of violence often perpetrated as violence against women. This was followed by a WHO report in 2002 (see below).&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Krug | first1 = Etienne G. | last2 = Dahlberg | first2 = Linda L. | last3 = Mercy | first3 = James A. | last4 = Zwi | first4 = Anthony B. | last5 = Lozano | first5 = Rafael | title = World report on violence and health | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2002 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=db9OHpk-TksC&amp;printsec=frontcover | isbn = 9789241545617 }}

*In 1999, the UN adopted the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] and designated [[November 25]] as the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt; 
*In 2002, as a follow-up of the WHA declaration in 1996 of violence as a major public health issue, the [[World Health Organization]] published the first World Report on Violence and Health, which addressed many types of violence and their effect on public health, including forms of violence affecting women particularly strongly. The report specifically noted the sharp rise in civil society organizations and activities directed at responding to gender-based violence against women from the 1970s to the 1990s.&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health" /&gt; 
*In 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] published its "Multi-country study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women", a study of women's health and [[domestic violence]] by surveying over 24,000 women in 10 countries from all regions of the world, which assessed the prevalence and extent of violence against women, particularly violence by intimate partners, and linked this with health outcomes to women as well as documenting strategies and services that women use to cope with intimate-partner violence.&lt;ref name="WHO Multicountry Study" /&gt;
*The 2006 UN Secretary General's "In-depth study on all forms of violence against women", the first comprehensive international document on the issue.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;
*The 2011 Council of Europe [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], which is the second regional legally-binding instrument on violence against women and girls.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt;

*Also in 2013, the [[UN General Assembly]] passed its first resolution calling for the protection of [[human rights defender|defenders]] of women's human rights.&lt;ref name="Norway Post"&gt;{{cite news | last = NRK |title=Protection of women human rights defenders | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131213142536/http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php/news/latest-news/29260-protection-of-women-human-rights-defenders | archive-date = 13 December 2013 |url=http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php/news/latest-news/29260-protection-of-women-human-rights-defenders |work=The Norway Post |date=30 November 2013 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution urges states to put in place gender-specific laws and policies for the protection of women's [[human rights defender]]s and to ensure that defenders themselves are involved in the design and implementation of these measures, and calls on states to protect women's human rights defenders from reprisals for cooperating with the UN and to ensure their unhindered access to and communication with international human rights bodies and mechanisms.&lt;ref name="awid.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-adopts-landmark-resolution-on-Protecting-Women-Human-Rights-Defenders |title=UN adopts landmark resolution on Protecting Women Human Rights Defenders |publisher=[[Association for Women's Rights in Development]] (AWID) |date=28 November 2013 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819203819/http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-adopts-landmark-resolution-on-Protecting-Women-Human-Rights-Defenders |archivedate=19 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, on the national level, individual countries have also organized efforts (legally, politically, socially) to prevent, reduce and punish violence against women. As a particular case study, here are some developments since the 1960s in the United States to oppose and treat violence against women:&lt;ref name="USDOJ-History of VAWA"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Violence Against Women (OVM)|title=The History of the Violence Against Women Act|url=http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/history-vawa.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=2 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017204719/http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/history-vawa.pdf|archivedate=17 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1967: One of the country's first domestic violence shelters opened in Maine.
*1972: The country's first rape help hotline opened in Washington, D.C.
*1978: Two national coalitions, the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault and the [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]], were formed, to raise awareness of these two forms of violence against women.
*1984: The U.S. Attorney General created the Department of Justice Task Force on Family Violence, to address ways in which the criminal justice system and community response to domestic violence should be improved.
*1994: Passage of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] or VAWA, legislation included in the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] of 1994, sponsored by then-Senator Joseph Biden, which required a strengthened community response to crimes of domestic violence and sexual assault, strengthened federal penalties for repeat sex offenders and strengthened legislative protection of victims, among many other provisions.
*2000: President Clinton signed into law the VAWA of 2000, further strengthening federal laws, and emphasizing assistance of immigrant victims, elderly victims, victims with disabilities, and victims of dating violence.
*2006: President Bush signed into law the VAWA of 2006, with an emphasis on programs to address violence against youth victims, and establishing programs for Engaging Men and Youth, and Culturally and Linguistically Specific Services.
*2007: The National Teen Dating Abuse Hotline opened.
*2009: President Obama declared April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
*2013: President Obama signed into law the VAWA of 2015, which granted Native American tribes the ability to prosecute non-Native offenders, and regulated reports of sexual assault on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kohlman | first = Cindy | title = Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) New Reporting Requirements Effective July 1, 2015 – Are You Ready? | url = https://www.inceptia.org | publisher = Inceptia Institute | date = 9 June 2015 }}

Other countries have also enacted comparable legislative, political and social instruments to address violence against women. Experts in the international community generally believe, however, that solely enacting punitive legislation for prevention and punishment of violence against women is not sufficient to address the problem. For example, although much stricter laws on violence against women have been passed in Bangladesh, violence against women is still rising.&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt; Instead, it is thought that wide societal changes to address gender inequalities and women's empowerment will be the way to reduce violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigeria-Female Hawkers-Interventions"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fawole | first1 = Olufunmilayo I. | last2 = Ajuwon | first2 = Ademola J. | last3 = Osungbade | first3 = Kayode O. | last4 = Faweya | first4 = Olufemi C. | title = Interventions for violence prevention among young female hawkers in motor parks in South-Western Nigeria: a review of effectiveness | journal = [[African Journal of Reproductive Health]] [La Revue Africaine de la Santé Reproductive] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 71&amp;ndash;82 | publisher = Women's Health and Action Research Centre (WHARC) | doi = 10.2307/3583347 | jstor = 3583347 | date = April 2003 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO VAM Factsheet"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Violence against women|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]| date = 1 September 2011|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on society==
[[File:Map3.1NEW Womens Physical Security 2011 compressed.jpg|thumb|A map of the world showing countries by level of women's physical security, 2011]]
According to an article in the [[Health and Human Rights (journal)|Health and Human Rights Journal]],&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt; regardless of many years of advocacy and involvement of many feminist activist organizations, the issue of violence against women still "remains one of the most pervasive forms of human rights violations worldwide".&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|91}} The violence against women can occur in both public and private spheres of life and at any time of their life span. Violence against women often keeps women from wholly contributing to social, economic, and political development of their communities.&lt;ref name="Fried"/&gt; Many women are terrified by these threats of violence and this essentially influences their lives so that they are impeded to exercise their human rights; for instance, they fear contributing to the development of their communities socially, economically and politically. Apart from that, the causes that trigger VAW or gender-based violence can go beyond just the issue of gender and into the issues of age, class, culture, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and specific geographical area of their origins.

Importantly, other than the issue of social divisions, violence can also extend into the realm of health issues and become a direct concern of the public health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Colarossi | first = Lisa | title = A response to Danis &amp; Lockhart: What guides social work knowledge about violence against women? | journal = Journal of Social Work Education | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 147&amp;ndash;159 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] on behalf of the [[Council on Social Work Education]] (CSWE) | doi = 10.517/FJSWE.2005.200400418 | jstor = 23044038 | date = Winter 2005 | ref = harv | postscript = .| doi-broken-date = 2018-06-01 }}

Women who have HIV/AIDS infection are also among the targets of the violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|91}} The [[World Health Organization]] reports that violence against women puts an undue burden on health care services, as women who have suffered violence are more likely to need health services and at higher cost, compared to women who have not suffered violence.&lt;ref name="WHO VAM Factsheet" /&gt; Another statement that confirms an understanding of VAW as being a significant health issue is apparent in the recommendation adopted by the Council of Europe, violence against women in private sphere, at home or [[domestic violence]], is the main reason of "death and disability" among the women who encountered violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|91}}

In addition, several studies have shown a link between poor treatment of women and international violence. These studies show that one of the best predictors of inter- and intranational violence is the maltreatment of women in the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Maffly | first = Brian | title = BYU study links women's safety, nation's peace | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100202080318/http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11967564 | archive-date = 2 February 2010 | url = http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11967564 | work = [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date = 21 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Strearmer | first1 = Matthew | last2 = Emmett | first2 = Chad F.|url=http://www.womanstats.org/images/StearmerEmmettAPSA07.pdf |title=The great divide: Revealing differences in the Islamic world regarding the status of women and its impact on international peace |publisher= [[WomanStats Project]] |date=2007 |accessdate=6 August 2014}} Paper prepared for presentation at the annual meeting of the [[American Political Science Association]], Chicago, Illinois, August 29–September 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant progress towards the protection of women from violence has been made on international level as a product of collective effort of lobbying by many women's rights movements; international organizations to civil society groups. As a result, worldwide governments and international as well as civil society organizations actively work to combat violence against women through a variety of programs. Among the major achievements of the women's rights movements against violence on girls and women, the landmark accomplishments are the "[[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]]" that implies "political will towards addressing VAW " and the legal binding agreement, "the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[CEDAW]])".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rosche | first1 = Daniela | last2 = Dawe | first2 = Alexandra | title = Oxfam Briefing Note: Ending violence against women the case for a comprehensive international action plan |page=2 | publisher = [[Oxfam|Oxfam GB]] | location = Oxford | year = 2013 | url = http://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/bn-ending-violence-against-women-action-plan-220213-en.pdf | isbn = 9781780772639 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the UN General Assembly resolution also designated 25 November as [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations | title = International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women | url = https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/news/vawd.html | website = un.org | publisher = [[United Nations]] |date= 17 December 1999|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Another typology: over time ===
[[File:Typology of Violence Against Women over Time.png|thumbnail|300 px|A diagram of typology of violence against women over time, as conceived by authors Charlotte Watts &amp; Cathy Zimmerman.]]

This similar typology from an academic journal article on violence against women shows similarly the different types of violence perpetrated against women according to what time period in a women's life the violence takes place.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt; However, it also classifies the types of violence according to the perpetrator. One important point to note is that more of the types of violence inflicted on women are perpetrated by someone the woman knows, either a family member or intimate partner, rather than a stranger.

==Types==
Violence against women can take a number of forms:

===Rape===
{{main|Rape}}
Rape is a type of [[sexual assault]], usually involving [[sexual intercourse]]. Rape is usually perpetrated by men against boys, women, and girls; women are usually assaulted more often than boys and girls and usually all by someone they know.

Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 varied between 0.1 in [[Egypt]] per 100,000 people and 91.6 per 100,000 people in [[Lesotho]] with 4.9 per 100,000 people in [[Lithuania]] as the [[median]].&lt;ref name="unodc1"&gt;{{cite book | last = UNODC | author-link = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | title = Rape at the National Level, number of police recorded offenses | url = http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Crime-statistics/Sexual_violence_sv_against_children_and_rape.xls | format = spreadsheet | publisher = [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Medical Association]] (1995), sexual violence, and rape in particular, is considered the most underreported violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = AMA | author-link = American Medical Association | title = Strategies for the treatment and prevention of sexual assault | publisher = [[American Medical Association]] | location = Chicago, Illinois | year = 1995 | oclc = 33901581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rds.homeoffice.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kelly | first1 = Liz | last2 = Regan | first2 = Linda | last3 = Lovett | first3 = Jo | author-link = Liz Kelly | title = A gap or a chasm?: Attrition in reported rape cases | publisher = Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate | location = London | id = 293 | year = 2005 | isbn = 9781844735556 | archiveurl = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf | archivedate = 18 February 2011 | url = http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf | format = pdf | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all | accessdate = 31 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of reporting, prosecution and convictions for rape varies considerably in different jurisdictions.

====Violence against victims====
Following a rape, a victim may face violence or threats of violence from the rapist, and, in many cultures, from the victim's own family and relatives. Violence or intimidation of the victim may be perpetrated by the rapist or by friends and relatives of the rapist, as a way of preventing the victims from reporting the rape, of punishing them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint; or it may be perpetrated by the relatives of the victim as a punishment for "bringing shame" to the family. This is especially the case in cultures where female [[virginity]] is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in [[honor killings]]. Victims may also be forced by their families to marry the rapist in order to restore the family's "honor".&lt;ref&gt;''Relevant articles'':

===Marital rape===
{{Main|Marital rape}}
Marital rape, also known as spousal rape, is non-consensual sex perpetrated by the victim's spouse. Once widely condoned or ignored by law, spousal rape is now repudiated by international conventions and increasingly criminalized. Still, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal, or is illegal but widely tolerated and accepted as a husband's prerogative. The criminalization of marital rape is recent, having occurred during the past few decades. Traditional understanding and views of [[marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexuality]], [[gender roles]] and [[self determination]] have started to be challenged in most Western countries during the 1960s and 1970s, which has led to the subsequent criminalization of marital rape during the following decades. With a few notable exceptions, it was during the past 30 years when most laws against marital rape have been enacted. Some countries in Scandinavia and in the former Communist Bloc of Europe made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but most Western countries criminalized it only in the 1980s and 1990s. In many parts of the world the laws against marital rape are very new, having been enacted in the 2000s.

In [[Canada]], marital rape was made illegal in 1983, when several legal changes were made, including changing the rape statute to ''sexual assault'', and making the laws gender neutral.&lt;ref name=grady&gt;{{cite book | last = Grady | first = William | title = Crime in Canadian context: debates and controversies | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780195433784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brennan | first1 = Shannon| last2 = Taylor-Butts | first2 = Andrea | title = Sexual assault in Canada, 2004 | publisher = Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics | location = Ottawa | year = 2008 |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85f0033m/85f0033m2008019-eng.pdf | format = pdf | isbn = 9781100111636 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = SIECCAN |title=Sexual assault in Canada: what do we know? |publisher=The Sex Information and Education Council of Canada (SIECCAN) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722071229/http://sexualityandu.ca/uploads/files/SexualAssault-OCT2011-ENG.pdf | archive-date = 22 July 2014 |url=http://sexualityandu.ca/uploads/files/SexualAssault-OCT2011-ENG.pdf | date = October 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] spousal rape was outlawed in 1990.&lt;ref name="Temkin86"&gt;{{cite book | last = Temkin | first = Jennifer | chapter = Defining and redefining rape | editor-last = Temkin | editor-first = Jennifer | title = Rape and the legal process | page = 86 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2002 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780198763543 }}

In [[England and Wales]], marital rape was made illegal in 1991. The views of Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century jurist, published in ''The History of the Pleas of the Crown'' (1736), stated that a husband cannot be guilty of the rape of his wife because the wife "hath given up herself in this kind to her husband, which she cannot retract"; in England and Wales this would remain law for more than 250 years, until it was abolished by the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]], in the case of ''R v R'' in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html |title=R v R [1991&amp;#93; UKHL 12 (23 October 1991) |publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Netherlands]] marital rape was also made illegal in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zeegers | first = Nicolle | title = What epistemology would serve criminal law best in finding the truth about rape? | journal = Law and Method | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 60&amp;ndash;71 | date = January 2012 | url = http://www.lawandmethod.nl/tijdschrift/lawandmethod/2012/1/ReM_2212-2508_2012_002_001_005 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.bjutijdschriften.nl/tijdschrift/lawandmethod/2012/1/ReM_2212-2508_2012_002_001_005.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the last Western countries to criminalize marital rape was [[Germany]], in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Kieler |first=Marita|date=2003|title=Tatbestandsprobleme der sexuellen Nötigung, Vergewaltigung sowie des sexuellen Mißbrauchs widerstandsunfähiger Personen|publisher=[[University of Osnabrück]] via Tenea | url = http://www.jurawelt.com/dissertationen/werke/8821|oclc=758907108}} [http://www.jurawelt.com/sunrise/media/mediafiles/13792/tenea_juraweltbd52_kieler.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between some religions ([[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]) and marital rape is controversial. The [[Bible]] at 1 Corinthians 7:3-5 explains that one has a "conjugal duty" to have sexual relations with one's spouse (in sharp opposition to [[sex outside marriage]], which is considered a [[sin]]) and states, "The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does.

Women are more likely to be [[victimized]] by someone that they are intimate with, commonly called "[[intimate partner violence]]" or (IPV). Instances of IPV tend not to be reported to police and thus many experts believe that the true magnitude of the problem is hard to estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Intimate partner violence: fact sheet | url = https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/ipvfacts.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211183916/http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/ipvfacts.htm | archive-date = 11 February 2007 | website = cdc.gov/ncipc | publisher = National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = 2006 | accessdate = 4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are much more likely than men to be [[murdered]] by an intimate partner.

In Western Europe, a country that has received major international criticism for the way it has dealt legally with the issue of violence against women is [[Finland]]; with authors pointing that a high level of equality for women in the public sphere (as in Finland) should never be equated with equality in all other aspects of women's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Clarke | first = Kris | title = The paradoxical approach to intimate partner violence in Finland | journal = [[Tokiwa University#Publications|International Perspectives in Victimology]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–19 | publisher = [[Tokiwa University]] via [[California State University|The Press at California State University]] | doi = 10.5364/ipiv.6.1.19 | date = August 2011 | ref = harv | doi-broken-date = 2018-06-01 }} [https://www.academia.edu/992154/The_Paradoxical_Approach_to_Intimate_Partner_Violence_in_Finland Available through academia.edu.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKie |first1=Linda |last2=Hearn |first2=Jeff |title=Gender-neutrality and gender equality: comparing and contrasting policy responses to 'domestic violence' in Finland and Scotland |journal=[[Scottish Affairs]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=85–107 |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |doi=10.3366/scot.2004.0043 |date=August 2004 |ref=harv }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20131021023708/http://www.scottishaffairs.org/backiss/pdfs/sa48/sa48_McKie_and_Hearn.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 2008 |title=Case Closed: Rape and Human Rights in the Nordic Countries |publisher=Amnesty International |url=https://amnesty.dk/media/1557/case-closed.pdf | pages = 89–91 | quote = Finland is repeatedly reminded of its widespread problem of violence against women and recommended to take more efficient measures to deal with the situation. International criticism concentrates on the lack of measures to combat violence against women in general and in particular on the lack of a national action plan to combat such violence and on the lack of legislation on domestic violence. (...) Compared to Sweden, Finland has been slower to reform legislation on violence against women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937, but not until 1971 in Finland. Rape within marriage was criminalised in Sweden in 1962, but the equivalent Finnish legislation only came into force in 1994 – making Finland one of the last European countries to criminalise marital rape. In addition, assaults taking place on private property did not become impeachable offences in Finland until 1995. Only in 1997 did victims of sexual offences and domestic violence in Finland become entitled to government-funded counselling and support services for the duration of their court cases. | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracie | last9 = Widger | first9 = Tom | last10 = Wisner | first10 = Katherine L. | chapter = Personality disorders and relational disorders: a research agenda for addressing crucial gaps in DSM | chapterurl = https://contextualscience.org/system/files/Kupfer,2002.pdf | editor-last1 = Kupfer | editor-first1 = David J. | editor-last2 = First | editor-first2 = Michael B. | editor-last3 = Regier | editor-first3 = Darrel A. | title = A research agenda for DSM-V | publisher = [[American Psychiatric Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780890422922 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|164, 166}} Couples with marital disorders sometimes come to clinical attention because the couple recognize long-standing dissatisfaction with their marriage and come to the [[clinician]] on their own initiative or are referred by an astute health care professional. Secondly, there is serious violence in the marriage that is -"usually the husband battering the wife".&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|163}} In these cases the emergency room or a legal authority often is the first to notify the [[clinician]]. Most importantly, marital violence "is a major risk factor for serious injury and even death and women in violent marriages are at much greater risk of being seriously injured or killed ([[National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women]] 2000)".&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|166}} The authors of this study add, "There is current considerable controversy over whether male-to-female marital violence is best regarded as a reflection of male [[psychopathology]] and control or whether there is an empirical base and clinical utility for conceptualizing these patterns as relational."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|166}}

Recommendations for clinicians making a diagnosis of ''Marital Relational Disorder'' should include the assessment of actual or "potential" male violence as regularly as they assess the potential for suicide in depressed patients. Further, "clinicians should not relax their vigilance after a battered wife leaves her husband, because some data suggest that the period immediately following a marital separation is the period of greatest risk for the women. Many men will [[stalking|stalk]] and [[battery (crime)|batter]] their wives in an effort to get them to return or punish them for leaving. Initial assessments of the potential for violence in a marriage can be supplemented by standardized interviews and questionnaires, which have been reliable and valid aids in exploring marital violence more systematically."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|166}}
 
The authors conclude with what they call "very recent information"&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}} on the course of violent marriages, which suggests that "over time a husband's battering may abate somewhat, but perhaps because he has successfully [[intimidate]]d his wife. The risk of violence remains strong in a marriage in which it has been a feature in the past. Thus, treatment is essential here; the clinician cannot just wait and watch."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}} The most urgent clinical priority is the protection of the wife because she is the one most frequently at risk, and clinicians must be aware that supporting assertiveness by a battered wife may lead to more beatings or even death.&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}}

====Honor killings====
[[Honor killings]] are a common form of violence against women in certain parts of the world. In honor killings, women and girls are killed by family members (usually husbands, fathers, uncles or brothers) because the women are believed to have brought shame or dishonor upon the family. These killings are a traditional practice, believed to have originated from tribal customs where an allegation against a woman can be enough to defile a family's reputation.&lt;ref name="BBC_ethics"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Ethics guide – Honour crimes | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml | work = [[BBC]] | date = | access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Definition of honor killing | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honor%20killing | website = merriam-webster.com | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are killed for reasons such as refusing to enter an [[arranged marriage]], being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, attempting to leave a marriage, having sex outside marriage, becoming the victim of rape, dressing in ways that are deemed inappropriate.&lt;ref name="BBC_ethics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | last = Harter | first = Pascale | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895 | publisher= [[BBC News]] | title=Libya rape victims 'face honour killings' | date=14 June 2011| access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dowry violence====
[[Image:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|upright|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]

The custom of [[dowry]], which is common in South Asia, especially in India, is the trigger of many forms of violence against women. [[Bride burning]] is a form of violence against women in which a bride is killed at home by her husband or husband's family due to his dissatisfaction over the dowry provided by her family. [[Dowry death]] refers to the phenomenon of women and girls being killed or committing [[suicide]] due to disputes regarding dowry. Dowry violence is common in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. In India, in 2011 alone, the National Crime Records Bureau reported 8,618 dowry deaths, while unofficial figures suggest the numbers to be at least three times higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Confronting dowry-related violence in India: women at the center of justice | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice | publisher = [[UN Women]] | date = 24 December 2012 | access-date = 18 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[forced marriage]] is a marriage in which one or both of the parties is married against their will. Forced marriages are common in South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The customs of [[bride price]] and [[dowry]], that exist in many parts of the world, contribute to this practice. A forced marriage is also often the result of a dispute between families, where the dispute is 'resolved' by giving a female from one family to the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

The custom of [[bride kidnapping]] continues to exist in some Central Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and the Caucasus, or parts of Africa, especially Ethiopia. A girl or a woman is abducted by the would be groom, who is often helped by his friends. The victim is often raped by the would be groom, after which he may try to negotiate a bride price with the village elders to legitimize the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''News articles'':

====Force-feeding====
In some countries, notably Mauritania, young girls are forcibly fattened to prepare them for marriage, because obesity is seen as desirable. This practice of [[force-feeding]] is known as ''[[leblouh]]'' or ''gavage''.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

''Son preference'' is a custom rooted in gender inequality that is prevalent in many countries and found across religions and classes.&lt;ref name="StopVAW_son"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Son preference | url =http://www.stopvaw.org/harmful_practices_son_preference | website = stopvaw.org | publisher = Stop Violence Against Women | date = June 2010 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although preference for a specific sex of the child may be common in an abstract way in many cultures, when such preference is so strong as to lead to the rejection of the child or to violence against the mother, this crosses the line into [[domestic violence]], [[child abuse]] and violence against women. Such forms of son preference are common especially in parts of [[South Asia]], [[East Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]. Manifestations of such practices include [[sex selective abortion]], [[female infanticide]], [[child abandonment|female child abandonment]], as well as favoring sons with regard to allocating of family resources.&lt;ref name="StopVAW_son" /&gt;

[[China]] and [[India]] have a very strong son preference. In China, the [[one child policy]] was largely responsible for an unbalanced sex ratio. Sex-selective abortion, as well as rejection of girl children is common. [[The Dying Rooms]] is a 1995 [[television]] [[documentary film]] about Chinese state orphanages, which documented how parents abandoned their newborn girls into [[orphanages]], where the staff would leave the children in rooms to die of thirst, or starvation.
Another manifestation of son preference is the violence inflicted against mothers who give birth to girls.&lt;ref&gt;''News articles'':

[[File:Mauricio rugendas - el malon.jpg|thumb|The painting depicts a Chilean woman being kidnapped during a [[malón]]. [[Bride kidnapping]] for the purpose of [[forced marriage]] and [[forced pregnancy]] was common through the history in many countries.]]
{{Main|Reproductive coercion|Forced pregnancy|Bride kidnapping}}
Reproductive coercion is violent, manipulative or deceptive behavior against [[reproductive health]] or [[reproductive rights]] within an intimate relation and includes a collection of behaviors intended to lead to [[forced pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="ACOG"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Committee on Health Care for Underserved Women | title = Committee Opinion No. 554: Reproductive and Sexual Coercion | journal = [[Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (journal)|Obstetrics and Gynecology]] | volume = 121 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 411&amp;ndash;415 | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|LWW]] | pmid = 23344307 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000426427.79586.3b | date = February 2013 | url = https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Health-Care-for-Underserved-Women/Reproductive-and-Sexual-Coercion | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive coercion is a form of [[domestic violence]], also known as [[intimate partner violence]], where behavior concerning reproductive health is used to maintain power, control, and domination within a relationship and over a partner through an unwanted pregnancy. It is considered a serious public health issue.&lt;ref name="ACOG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chamberlain | first1 = Linda | last2 = Levenson | first2 = Rebecca | title = Reproductive health and partner violence guidelines: an integrated response to intimate partner Violence and reproductive coercion | url = http://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/HealthCare/Repro_Guide.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = Family Violence Prevention Fund | location = San Francisco | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reproductive control is highly correlated to [[unintended pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coker | first = Ann L. | title = Does physical intimate partner violence affect sexual health?

Forced pregnancy is the practice of forcing a woman or girl to become [[pregnant]], often as part of a [[forced marriage]], including by means of [[bride kidnapping]], through rape (including [[marital rape]], [[war rape]] and [[genocidal rape]]) or as part of a program of breeding [[slave]]s (see [[Slave breeding in the United States]]). In the 20th century, state mandated forced marriage with the aim of increasing the population was practiced by some authoritarian governments, notably during the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]], which systematically forced people into marriages ordering them to have children, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Natalae | title = Memorandum: Charging forced marriage as a crime against humanity | url =http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = Documentation Center of Cambodia | date = 22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced pregnancy is strongly connected to the custom of [[bride price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women’s fears and men’s anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.1999.00054.x}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the discourse on reproductive rights, the issue of [[abortion]] is often debated. [[Abortion law]] falls within the jurisdiction of each country, although [[forced abortion]] is prohibited by international law. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits forced abortion and [[forced sterilization]] (Article 39).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = CoE | author-link = Council of Europe | title = Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence | url = https://rm.coe.int/168046031c | publisher = [[Council of Europe]] | date = 12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of ''forced continuation of pregnancy'' (i.e. denying a woman safe and legal abortion) is also seen by some organizations as a violation of women's rights, although there are no binding international obligations on this issue. However, the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women's sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states, "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, ''criminalisation of abortion'', ''denial or delay of safe abortion and post abortion care'', ''forced continuation of pregnancy'', abuse and mistreatment of women and girls seeking sexual and reproductive health information, goods and services, are forms of gender based violence that, depending on the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women | author-link = Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women#Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women | title = General recommendation No. 35 on gender-based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19 | url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf | publisher = [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) | id = CEDAW/C/GC/35 | date = 14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mob violence===
In 2010 [[Amnesty International]] reported that [[Hassi Messaoud mob attacks against women|mob attacks]] against single women were taking place in [[Hassi Messaoud]], Algeria.&lt;ref name="Amnesty"&gt;{{cite web|title=Algerian authorities must investigate and stop attacks against women|url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/22931/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=13 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903140432/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/22931/|archivedate=3 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amnesty International, "some women have been sexually abused" and were targeted "not just because they are women, but because they are living alone and are economically independent".&lt;ref name="Amnesty" /&gt;

===Dating abuse===
{{See|Dating abuse|Teen dating violence}}
Dating abuse or dating violence is the perpetration of coercion, intimidation or assault in the context of [[dating]] or [[courtship]]. It is also when one partner tries to maintain [[abusive power and control]]. Dating violence is defined by the CDC as "the physical, sexual, psychological, or emotional violence within a dating relationship, including stalking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Intimate partner violence: teen dating violence | url = https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html | website = cdc.gov | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = 2016 | accessdate = 21 October 2017}} [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/teen-dating-violence-factsheet-a.pdf Fact sheet pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries it is common for older men to engage in "compensated dating" with underage girls. Such relationships are called [[enjo kōsai]] in Japan, and are also common in Asian countries such as Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong. The WHO condemned "economically coerced sex (e.g. school girls having sex with “sugar daddies” in return for school fees)" as a form of violence against women.&lt;ref name="WHO_VAW" /&gt;

===Sexual violence on college campuses===

Sexual violence on college campuses is considered a major problem in the United States. According to the conclusion of a major Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study: "The CSA Study data suggest women at universities are at considerable risk for experiencing sexual assault."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Krebs | first1 = Christopher P. | last2 =Lindquist | first2 = Christine H. | last3 =Warner | first3 = Tara D. | last4 =Fisher | first4 = Bonnie S. | last5 =Martin | first5 = Sandra L. | title = Campus sexual assault (CSA) study: final report | publisher = [[RTI International]] | url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=243011 | date = October 2007 }} {{NCJ|243011}} [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence on campus has been researched in other countries too, such as Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeKeseredy | first1 = Walter | last2 = Kelly|  first2 = Katharine | title = The incidence and prevalence of woman abuse in Canadian university and college dating relationships | journal = [[Canadian Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 137&amp;ndash;159 | publisher = [[University of Alberta]] | jstor = 3341255 | doi = 10.2307/3341255 | date = 1993 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3341255 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = NUS | author-link = National Union of Students (United Kingdom) |title=Hidden Marks: A study of women student's experiences of harassment, stalking, violence, and sexual assault | url = http://www.nus.org.uk/Global/NUS_hidden_marks_report_2nd_edition_web.pdf | publisher = [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] | location = London, UK | date = 2011| edition = 2nd|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gavey | authorlink=Nicola Gavey|first = Nicola | title = Sexual victimization prevalence among New Zealand university students | journal = [[Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 464&amp;ndash;466 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0022-006X.59.3.464 | date = June 1991 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.59.3.464 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restrictions on freedom of movement===
Women are, in many parts of the world, severely restricted in their [[freedom of movement]].
Freedom of movement is an essential right, recognized by international instruments, including Article 15 (4) of [[CEDAW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  UN General Assembly | author-link =  UN General Assembly | title = The convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (CEDAW) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140326154350/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm | archive-date = 26 March 2014 | url = http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm | publisher = [[UN Women|UN Women, Division for the Advancement of Women]] | date = 1979 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in some countries, women are not legally allowed to leave home without a [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|male guardian]] (male relative or husband).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lee | first = Dave | title = Saudi Arabian woman challenges male guardianship laws | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13932287 | work = [[BBC World Service]] | date = 29 June 2011 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in countries where there are no laws against women traveling alone, there are strong social norms, such as [[purdah]] - a religious and social practice of female [[seclusion]] prevalent especially among some [[Muslim]] and [[Hindu]] communities in [[South Asia]]. Many countries have laws on what type of clothing women may or may not wear in public (see [[Hijab by country]]). Women in some cultures are forced into [[social isolation]] during their [[menstruation|menstrual period]]s. In parts of Nepal for instance, they are forced to live in sheds, are forbidden to touch men or even to enter the courtyard of their own homes, and are barred from consuming milk, yogurt, butter, meat, and various other foods, for fear they will contaminate those goods. (see [[Chhaupadi]]). Women have died during this period because of starvation, bad weather, or bites by snakes.&lt;ref&gt;''Articles'':

===Denial of medical care===
[[File:Maternal mortality rate worldwide.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Maternal Mortality Rate]] worldwide, as defined by the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management, excluding accidental or incidental causes.&lt;ref name=CIA2010&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html?countryName=Australia&amp;countryCode=as&amp;regionCode=aus&amp;rank=156#as Country Comparison: Maternal Mortality Rate] in [[:en:The World Factbook|The CIA World Factbook]]. Date of Information: 2010&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Women in many parts of the world are often denied medical care. Denial of access to 
health assistance, along with denial of access to other services, is a form of socioeconomic violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.womensrefugeecommission.org/images/zdocs/gl_sgbv03_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the WHO, "Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/discrimination-in-health-care/en/|title=Joint United Nations statement on ending discrimination in health care settings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women may be denied medical care for numerous reasons, including lack of necessary [[freedom of movement]] allowing women to leave home so they can go to a medical facility, lack of financial resources, the need (in law or in practice) for a male relative or husband to consent to the medical care of the woman. A common consequence of denial of women's medical care is [[maternal mortality]]. Globally, there are more than 300.000 cases of maternal mortality yearly, with 99% of all maternal deaths occurring in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|title=Maternal mortality|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denial of medical care often occurs with regard to reproductive and sexual health. Sometimes women themselves avoid the medical system  for fear of being reported to the police or facing family violence due to having [[premarital sex]] or being the victims of [[sexual violence]]. In some parts of Latin America, with very strict anti-abortion laws, pregnant women avoid the medical system due to fear of being investigated by the authorities if they have a miscarriage, or a stillbirth, or other problems with the pregnancy. Prosecuting such women is quite common in places such as [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/07/el-salvador-rape-survivor-sentenced-to-30-years-in-jail-under-extreme-anti-abortion-law/|title=El Salvador: Rape survivor sentenced to 30 years in jail under extreme anti-abortion law|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-latin-america-32491838/el-salvador-women-jailed-for-miscarriages|title=Jailed for a miscarriage|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Prügl, E.

===Stalking===
{{Main|Stalking}}
Stalking is unwanted or obsessive attention by an individual or group toward another person, often manifested through persistent [[harassment]], [[intimidation]], or following/monitoring of the victim. Stalking is often understood as "course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/stalking-resource-center/stalking-information |title=Stalking information |website =victimsofcrime.org | publisher = Stalking Resource Center |date= |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although stalkers are frequently portrayed as being strangers, they are most often known people, such as former or current partners, friends, colleagues or acquaintances.

===Sexual harassment===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is abusive, uninvited and unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature, typically in the work/studying place, which may include [[intimidation]], [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature, or the inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors. It can be verbal or physical, and it is often perpetrated by a person in a position of authority against a subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/whatissh.pdf |format=pdf |title=What is sexual harassment |publisher=[[UN Women]] |accessdate=3 April 2016}}

: "Trafficking in persons" shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.

[[Witch trials in the early modern period]] (between the 15th and 18th centuries) were common in Europe and in the European colonies in North America. Today, there remain regions of the world (such as parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], rural [[North India]], and [[Papua New Guinea]]) where belief in [[witchcraft]] is held by many people, and women accused of being witches are subjected to serious violence.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

War rapes are rapes committed by soldiers, other combatants or civilians during armed conflict or war, or during military occupation, distinguished from sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service. It also covers the situation where women are forced into prostitution or [[sexual slavery]] by an occupying power. During World War II the Japanese military established brothels filled with "[[comfort women]]", girls and women who were forced into sexual slavery for soldiers, exploiting women for the purpose of creating access and entitlement for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benedict |first=Helen |url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/ |title=Why soldiers rape |work=[[In These Times]] |date=14 August 2008 | access-date = 10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Morris-Suzuki | first = Tessa | title = Japan's 'Comfort Women': It's time for the truth (in the ordinary, everyday sense of the word) | journal = Japan Focus (The Asia-Pacific Journal) | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | date = 1 March 2007 | url = http://www.japanfocus.org/-Tessa-Morris_Suzuki/2373  |accessdate=4 August 2011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape was committed during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] by members of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistani military]] and the [[militia]]s that supported them. Over a period of nine months, hundreds of thousands of women were raped. [[Susan Brownmiller]], in her report on the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|atrocities]], said that girls from the age of eight to grandmothers of seventy-five suffered attacks. {{See also|Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War}}

Rape used as a weapon of war was practiced during the [[Bosnian War]] where rape was used as a highly systematized instrument of war by Serb armed forces predominantly targeting women and girls of the Bosniak ethnic group for physical and moral destruction. Estimates of the number of women raped during the war range from 50,000 to 60,000; as of 2010 only 12 cases have been prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UNSC | author-link = United Nations Security Council | title = Report of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia Since 1991 | id = A/52/375{{spaces|2}}S/1997/729 | publisher = [[United Nations Security Council]] |url=http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Reports%20and%20Publications/AnnualReports/annual_report_1997_en.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804004034/http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Reports%20and%20Publications/AnnualReports/annual_report_1997_en.pdf |archivedate=4 August 2012 | date = 18 September 1997 | access-date = 10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{See also|Rape during the Bosnian War}}

Human rights violations perpetrated by police and military personnel in many countries are correlated with decreased access to public health services and increased practices of risky behavior among members of vulnerable groups, such as women and female sex workers.&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Martinex G, Gaines T, et al. 2012 403–410"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beletsky | first1 = Leo | last2 = et al | title = Mexico’s northern border conflict: collateral damage to health and human rights of vulnerable groups | journal = [[Pan American Journal of Public Health]] | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 403&amp;ndash;410 | publisher = [[Pan American Health Organization]] | doi = 10.1590/s1020-49892012000500008 | pmc = 3660986 | pmid = 22767041 | date = May 2012 | url = https://doi.org/10.1590/s1020-49892012000500008 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; These practices are especially widespread in settings with a weak rule of law and low levels of police and military management and professionalism.

====Stoning and flogging====
[[Stoning]], or lapidation, refers to a form of [[capital punishment]] whereby an organized group throws stones at an individual until the person dies. Stoning is a punishment that is included in the laws of several countries, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria, as punishment for [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Batha | first = Emma | title = FACTBOX: Stoning - where does it happen? | work = [[Thomson Reuters Foundation News]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160125051613/http://news.trust.org//item/20130927165059-w9g0i | archive-date = 25 January 2016 | url = http://news.trust.org//item/20130927165059-w9g0i | publisher = [[Thomson Reuters Foundation]] | date = 29 September 2013 | access-date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flogging]] or flagellation is the act of methodically beating or whipping the human body. It is a judicial punishment in various countries for specific crimes, including [[sex outside marriage]]. These punishments employed for sexual relations outside marriage, apart from constituting a form of violence in themselves, can also deter victims of [[sexual violence]] from reporting the crime, because the victims may themselves be punished (if they cannot prove their case, if they are deemed to have been in the company of an unrelated male, or if they were unmarried and not virgins at the time of the rape).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lang | first = Olivia | title=Maldives girl to get 100 lashes for pre-marital sex | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21595814 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=26 February 2013 | access-date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jamali |first=Hasan |url=http://www.today.com/id/15836746/ns/today-today_news/t/rape-case-calls-saudi-legal-system-question/#.UolafidedO6 |title=Rape case brings Saudi laws into focus |work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |publisher=[[NBC]] |date= |accessdate=19 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JdMstMvl?url=http://www.today.com/id/15836746/ns/today-today_news/t/rape-case-calls-saudi-legal-system-question/ |archivedate=14 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female genital mutilation===

Female genital mutilation (FGM) is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons".&lt;ref name="WHO FGM"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Female genital mutilation (factsheet) |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date= June 2000 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 125 million women and girls in Africa and the Middle East have experienced FGM.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;{{cite book | last = UNICEF | author-link = UNICEF | title = Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change | url = http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[UNICEF]] | date = 22 July 2013 | accessdate = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO states: "The procedure has no health benefits for girls and women" and "Procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn deaths" and "FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women."&lt;ref name="WHO FGM"/&gt; According to a UNICEF report, the top rates for FGM are in Somalia (with 98 percent of women affected), Guinea (96 percent), Djibouti (93 percent), Egypt (91 percent), Eritrea (89 percent), Mali (89 percent), Sierra Leone (88 percent), Sudan (88 percent), Gambia (76 percent), Burkina Faso (76 percent), Ethiopia (74 percent), Mauritania (69 percent), Liberia (66 percent), and Guinea-Bissau (50 percent).&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

According to some local practitioners, it is believed that FGM is linked to cultural rites and customs. It is considered to be a traditional practice that continues to take place in different communities/countries of Africa and Middle East, including in places where it is banned by national legislation. FGM is defined as a "harmful traditional practice"&lt;ref name="Shell-Duncan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shell-Duncan | first = Bettina | title = From health to human rights: female genital cutting and the politics of intervention | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 110 | issue = 2 | pages = 225&amp;ndash;236 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2008.00028.x | date = June 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1548-1433.2008.00028.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance to the Inter-African Committee.

The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits female genital mutilation (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence | url = https://rm.coe.int/168046031c | date = 12 April 2011 | access-date = 8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, in [[Africa]], FGM has been legally banned in Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

There exist several approaches that were set up by international health organizations and civil societies (for example, [[Tostan]]) aimed at eliminating the practice of FGM in implemented countries: 
# FGM as a Health issue (also known as health risks approach)
# FGM as a Human Rights issue (also known as Human Rights-based approach)

Some scholars suggests that, when dealing with FGM, it is necessary to take lessons from history, particularly 19th-century campaign against [[foot-binding]] in China,&lt;ref name="Kwame Appiah"&gt;{{cite news | last = Appiah | first = Kwame Anthony | author-link = Kwame Anthony Appiah | title = The art of social change | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/magazine/24FOB-Footbinding-t.html?pagewanted=all |work = [[The New York Times]] |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was successful.

===Obstetric violence===
{{See|Abuse during childbirth}}
"Obstetric violence" refers to acts categorized as physically or psychologically violent in the context of labor and birth. In most developed and many [[developing countries]], birth takes place in an increasingly medicalized environment; with numerous surgical interventions that the pregnant woman can sometimes be coerced into accepting, or which are done without her consent, or which are unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Habek | first1 = Dubravko | last2 = Vuković Bobić | first2 = Mirna | last3 = Hrgović | first3 = Zlatko | title = Possible feto-maternal clinical risk of the Kristeller’s expression | journal = [[Central European Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 3&amp;ndash;6 | publisher = [[Walter de Gruyter]] | doi = 10.2478/s11536-008-0008-z | date = 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.2478/s11536-008-0008-z | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO_Normal"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Care in normal birth: a practical guide | id = WHO/FRH/MSM/96.24 | url = http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/who_frh_msm_9624/en/ | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | series = Safe Motherhood Practical Guide | year = 1996 | access-date = 2 December 2013}} [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/63167/1/WHO_FRH_MSM_96.24.pdf Pdf.]

Many such practices originate in patriarchal ideologies. The WHO stated: "in normal birth, there should be a valid reason to interfere with the natural process. The aim of care is to achieve a healthy mother and child with the least possible level of intervention compatible with safety."&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dobbeleir | first1 = Julie M.L.C.L. | last2 = Landuyt | first2 = Koenraad Van | last3 = Monstrey | first3 = Stan J. | title = Aesthetic surgery of the female genitalia | journal = Seminars in Plastic Surgery | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 130&amp;ndash;141 | publisher = [[Thieme Medical Publishers|Thieme]] | doi = 10.1055/s-0031-1281482 | pmc = 3312147 | date = May 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0031-1281482 | ref = harv | postscript = . | pmid=22547970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO_Normal" /&gt;

=== Violence against indigenous women ===
Indigenous women around the world are often targets of sexual assault or physical violence. Many indigenous communities are rural, with few resources and little help from the government or non-state actors. These groups also often have strained relationships with law enforcement, making prosecution difficult. Many indigenous societies also find themselves at the center of land disputes between nations and ethnic groups, often resulting in these communities bearing the brunt of national and ethnic conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = UNFPA | last2 = UNICEF | last3 = UN Women | last4 = ILO | last5 = Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children (OSRSG/VAC) | author-link1 = United Nations Population Fund | author-link2 = UNICEF | author-link3 = UN Women | author-link4 = International Labour Organization | title = Breaking the silence on violence against indigenous girls, adolescents and young women: A call to action based on an overview of existing evidence from Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America | url = http://www.unfpa.org/resources/breaking-silence-violence-against-indigenous-girls-adolescents-and-young-women | publisher = [[UNICEF]] | date = May 2013 | access-date = 10 May 2016}} [https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/resource-pdf/VAIWG_FINAL.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence against indigenous women is often perpetrated by the state, such as in [[Peru]], in the 1990s. President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a [[forced sterilization]] program put in place by his administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 24 July 2002 | access-date = 30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented 28 July 1995.

[[Guatemala]]n indigenous women have also faced extensive violence. Throughout over three decades of conflict, [[Maya civilization|Maya]] women and girls have continued to be targeted. The Commission for Historical Clarification found that 88% of women affected by state-sponsored rape and sexual violence against women were indigenous.

The concept of white dominion over indigenous women's bodies has been rooted in American history since the beginning of colonization. The theory of manifest destiny went beyond simple land extension and into the belief that European settlers had the right to exploit Native women's bodies as a method of taming and "humanizing" them.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roe | first1 = Bubar | last2 = Jumper Thurman | first2 = Pamela | title = Violence against native women | journal = [[Social Justice (journal)|Social Justice]], special issue: Native Women and State Violence | volume = 31 | issue = 4 [98] | pages = 70&amp;ndash;86 | publisher = Social Justice | jstor = 29768276 | date = 2004 | url = http://www.socialjusticejournal.org/?product=roe-bubar-and-pamela-jumper-thurman-2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ramirez | first = Renya | title = Healing, violence, and Native American women | journal = [[Social Justice (journal)|Social Justice]], special issue: Native Women and State Violence | volume = 31 | issue = 4 [98] | pages = 103&amp;ndash;116 | publisher = Social Justice | jstor = 29768279 | date = 2004 | url = http://www.socialjusticejournal.org/?product=renya-ramirez-2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canada]] has an extensive problem with violence against indigenous women, by both indigenous men and non-aboriginals. "[I]t has been consistently found that Aboriginal women have a higher likelihood of being victimized compared to the rest of the female population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Sinha | editor-first = Maire | title = Measuring violence against women: statistical trends 2006 (85-570-XWE) | page = 19 | publisher = Statistics Canada | location = Ottawa, Ontario | series = ''Juristat'' | url = http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2013001/article/11766-eng.pdf | year = 2006 }}

The history of [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]] and economic inequality of indigenous Canadians has resulted in communities facing violence, unemployment, drug use, alcoholism, political corruption, and high rates of suicide.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"/&gt; In addition, there has been clear and admitted racism towards indigenous people by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], making victims less likely to report cases of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jackson |first=Kenneth |title=Top Mountie Admits Racism in Ranks towards Indigenous People |work=[[Aboriginal People's Television Network]] |date=9 December 2015 |url=http://aptn.ca/news/2015/12/09/top-mountie-admits-racism-in-ranks-towards-indigenous-people/ | access-date = 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the issues facing indigenous women in Canada have been addressed via the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women (MMIW) initiatives. Thousands of Native Canadian women have gone missing or been killed in the past 30 years, with little representation or attention from the government. Efforts to make the Canadian public aware of these women's disappearances have mostly been led by Aboriginal communities, who often reached across provinces to support one another. In 2015, prime minister [[Stephen Harper]] commented that the issue of murdered and missing indigenous women was "not high on our radar",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Full Text of Peter Mansbridge's interview with Stephen Harper | work = [[CBC News]] | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2105-full-text-of-peter-mansbridge-s-interview-with-stephen-harper-1.3218399 | date = 7 September 2015 | access-date = 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting outrage in already frustrated indigenous communities. A few months later, Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] launched an official inquiry into the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women.

In the United States, Native American women are more than twice as likely to experience violence than any other demographic.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"/&gt; One in three Native women is sexually assaulted during her life, and over 85% of these assaults are perpetrated by non-Natives.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chekuru | first = Kavitha | title = Sexual violence scars Native American Women | url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/03/201334111633172507.html | work = [[Al Jazeera]] | date = 6 March 2013 | access-date = 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disproportionate rate of assault to indigenous women is due to a variety of causes, including but not limited to the legal inability of tribes to prosecute perpetrators who are not tribal members. Tribes currently cannot exercise criminal jurisdiction over non-Natives. In theory, tribes can send cases to the federal level in order to prosecute non-Natives, but the majority of these cases are thrown out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Bachman | first1 = Ronet | last2 = Zaykowski| first2 = Heather | last3 = Kallmyer | first3 = Rachel | last4 = Poteyeva | first4 = Margarita | last5 = Lanier | first5 = Christina | title = Violence against American Indian and Alaska native women and the criminal justice response: what is known | publisher = [[National Institute of Justice]] | url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=245615 | date = August 2008 | access-date = 10 May 2016}} {{NCJ|245615}} [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/223691.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, many reservations have become popular destinations for rapists and serial killers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gettys | first = Travis | title = Outsiders have been raping Native American women with ‘impunity’ — but legal loophole may finally close | url = https://www.rawstory.com/2015/04/outsiders-have-been-raping-native-american-women-with-impunity-but-legal-loophole-may-finally-close/ | work = [[The Raw Story]] | date = 6 April 2015 | access-date = 10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple versions of the Violence Against Women Act have attempted to address this issue, but these sections have often been removed from official versions of the act.

===Violence against immigrant and refugee women===
Immigrant and refugee women often face violence, both in the private sphere (by partners and other family members) and in the public sphere (by the police and other authorities). These women are often in a vulnerable position: they do not speak the language of the country they are in, they do not know its laws, and sometimes they are in a legal position where they may be deported if they make contact with the authorities. Women who seek protection from armed conflict in their countries of origin often face more violence while travelling to the destination country or when they arrive there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Freedman | first = Jane | title = Sexual and gender-based violence against refugee women: a hidden aspect of the refugee "crisis" | journal = [[Reproductive Health Matters]], special issue – Violence: A Barrier to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights | volume = 24 | issue = 47 | pages = 18&amp;ndash;26 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1016/j.rhm.2016.05.003 | pmid = 27578335 | date = 2017 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rhm.2016.05.003 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robbers | first1 = Gianna | last2 = Gunta | first2 = Lazdane | last3 = Dinesh | first3 = Sethi | title = Sexual violence against refugee women on the move to and within Europe | journal = [[Entre Nous (journal)|Entre Nous]], special issue: Together for a Better Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health | volume = 84 | pages = 26&amp;ndash;29 | publisher = [[WHO]]/Europe | date = 2016 | url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous/together-for-a-better-sexual-and-reproductive-health.-entre-nous-no-84,-2016 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/319301/Entre-Nous-84-full-book.pdf?ua=1 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport-related===

Sport-related violence against women refers to any physical, sexual, mental acts that are "perpetrated by both male athletes and by male fans or consumers of sport and sporting events, as well as by coaches of female athletes".&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Catherine|title=Violence against women and sport: Literature review|year=2011|publisher=Durham University|location=London|pages=2–5|url=http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/22/violence-against-women-and-sport-a-literature-review-by-dr-catherine-palmer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106162130/http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/22/violence-against-women-and-sport-a-literature-review-by-dr-catherine-palmer|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documenting reports and literature suggest that there are obvious connections between contemporary sport and violence against women. Such events as the [[2010 World Cup]], the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] "have highlighted the connections between sports spectatorship and intimate partner violence, and the need for police, authorities and services to be aware of this when planning sporting events".&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer" /&gt;

Sport-related violence can occur in various contexts and places, including homes, pubs, clubs, hotel rooms, the streets.&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer" /&gt;

====Sport-related violence by male college athletes====

Violence against women is a topic of concern in the United States' collegiate athletic community. From the 2010 UVA lacrosse murder, in which a male athlete was charged guilty with second degree murder of his girlfriend, to the 2004 University of Colorado Football Scandal when players were charged with nine alleged sexual assaults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vaughan|first=Kevin|title=Colorado woman seeks justice in alleged sexual assault Read more: Colorado woman seeks justice in alleged sexual assault|url=http://www.denverpost.com/firstinthepost/ci_12557039|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=9 June 2009|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies suggest that athletes are at higher risk for committing sexual assault against women than the average student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brady|first=Jeff|author-link=Jeff Brady (reporter)|title=Scandal Returns to University of Colorado Football|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105381707|work=[[Weekend Edition]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chandler1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandler|first1=Steve B.|last2=Johnson|first2=Dewayne J.|last3=Carroll|first3=Pamela S.|title=Abusive behaviors of college athletes | journal = [[College Student Journal]] | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 638&amp;ndash;645 | publisher = [[University of South Alabama]] | date = 1 December 1999 | url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/193500507 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that one in three college assaults are committed by athletes.&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mak|first=Stephanie|title=Are athletes more abusive than the rest of the student population?|url=http://web1.johnshopkins.edu/hurj/issue3/spotlight-mak.html|journal=Hopkins Undergraduate Research Journal Online|accessdate=12 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229044851/http://web1.johnshopkins.edu/hurj/issue3/spotlight-mak.html|archivedate=29 February 2012|date=2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys suggest that male student athletes who represent 3.3% of the college population, commit 19% of reported sexual assaults and 35% of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff writer|title=Game stats|publisher=The National Coalition Against Violent Athletes (NCVA)|accessdate=27 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117092517/http://www.ncava.org/statistics.html|archivedate=17 November 2016|url=http://www.ncava.org:80/statistics.html|df=dmy-all}}

====Controversy over contributing factors====

Sociologist Timothy Curry, after conducting an observational analysis of two big time sports' locker room conversations, deduced that the high risk of male student athletes for gender abuse is a result of the team's subculture.&lt;ref name=Curry1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=Timothy Jon|title=Fraternal Bonding in the Locker Room: A Profeminist Analysis Of Talk About Competition And Women|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|year=1991|volume=8|issue=2|pages=119–135 |url=http://www.umt.edu/sociology/faculty_staff/ellestad/documents/275_Curry1991fraternalbondinginthelockerroom_s10.pdf |accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states, "Their locker room talk generally treated women as objects, encouraged sexist attitudes toward women and, in its extreme, promoted rape culture."&lt;ref name=Curry1991/&gt; He proposes that this objectification is a way for the male to reaffirm his heterosexual status and hyper-masculinity. Claims have been made that the atmosphere changes when an outsider (especially women) intrude in the locker room. In the wake of the reporter [[Lisa Olson]] being harassed by a Patriots player in the locker room in 1990, she reflected, "We are taught to think we must have done something wrong and it took me a while to realize I hadn't done anything wrong."&lt;ref name="Disch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Disch|first=Lisa|author2=Kane, Mary Jo |title=When a Looker is Really a Bitch: Lisa Olson, Sport, and the Heterosexual Matrix|journal=Signs|date=Winter 1996|volume=21|issue=2|pages=278–308|jstor=3175065|doi=10.1086/495067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other female sports reporters (college and professional) have claimed that they often brush off the players' comments, which leads to further objectification.&lt;ref name="Disch" /&gt; Other sociologists challenge this claim. Steve Chandler notes that because of their celebrity status on campus, "athletes are more likely to be scrutinized or falsely accused than non-athletes."&lt;ref name="chandler1999"/&gt; Another contender, Stephanie Mak, notes that, "if one considers the 1998 estimates that about three million women were battered and almost one million raped, the proportion of incidences that involve athletes in comparison to the regular population is relatively small."&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1"/&gt;

====Response to violence by male college athletes====

In response to the proposed link between college athletes and gender-based violence, and media coverage holding Universities as responsible for these scandals more universities are requiring athletes to attend workshops that promote awareness. For example, St. John's University holds sexual assault awareness classes in the fall for its incoming student athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newsom|first=John|title=Share on emailShare on redditMore Sharing Services Few Colleges Tackle Issue of Athlete Sex Assaults|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-22/news/mn-7249_1_sexual-assault|publisher=Los Angeles Times Online |date=22 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups, such as the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes, have formed to provide support for the victims as their mission statement reads, "The NCAVA works to eliminate off the field violence by athletes through the implementation of prevention methods that recognize and promote the positive leadership potential of athletes within their communities. In order to eliminate violence, the NCAVA is dedicated to empowering individuals affected by athlete violence through comprehensive services including advocacy, education and counseling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.ncava.org/Mission.html|publisher=National Coalition Against Violent Athletes|accessdate=12 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416074831/http://www.ncava.org/Mission.html|archivedate=16 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to better comprehend the anti-violence movements against VAW, there is a need to also understand the generic historical background of [[feminist movements]] in a holistic manner. Talking about the international women's movement, many feminist scholars have categorized these movements into three waves&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kroløkke | first1 = Charlotte | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = Ann Scott | chapter = Three waves of feminism: from suffragettes to grrls | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IEhqiWR1Rt0C&amp;pg=PA1 | editor-last1 = Kroløkke | editor-first1 = Charlotte | editor-last2 = Sørensen | editor-first2 = Ann Scott | title = Gender communication theories &amp; analyses: from silence to performance | pages = 1&amp;ndash;23 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780761929185 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to their different beliefs, strategies and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rupp | first1 = Leila J. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Verta | title = Forging feminist identity in an international movement: a collective identity approach to twentieth-century feminism | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs]] | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 363&amp;ndash;386 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | doi = 10.1086/495344 | jstor = 3175646 | date = Winter 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/495344 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the first women's movements, or so called the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] of feminism, dated back in the years the late 19th Century and early 20th Century in the United States and Europe. During this period, feminist movements developed from the context of industrialization and liberal politics that triggered the rise of feminist groups concerned with gaining equal access and opportunity for women.&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|1}} This wave marks a period of "[[Women's suffrage|suffrage]], independence, rights to nationality, work and [[Gender pay gap|equal pay]]" for women.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last = Prügl | first = Elisabeth (Lecturer) | title = Violence Against Women. Gender and International Affairs Class 2013 | url = http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/study/courses/courses-2017-2018/masters-interdisciplinaires/mia/ia039---gender-and-international.html | location = Geneva, Switzerland | publisher = Lecture conducted from [[The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] (IHEID) | date = 2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] of feminist movements was the series of movements from the period of the late 1960s to early 1970s. It was noted by feminist scholars that this wave could be characterized as a period of [[Women's liberation movement|women's liberation]] and the rise of a branch of feminism known as [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|7–8}} This wave of feminism emerged in the context of the postwar period&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|8}} in society where other mainstream movements also played a large role; for instance, the [[civil rights movements]],&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013" /&gt; which meant to condemn [[capitalism]], [[imperialism]] and the oppression of people based on the notions of [[Racism|race]], ethnicity, [[gender identity]] and [[LGBT social movements|sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|9}} This wave marks a period of equal rights at home and workplace as well as rights to development&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013" /&gt; for the purposes of people of different races, ethnicities, economic statuses and gender identities.

The [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] of feminism is the newest wave of feminism led by young feminists whose understanding and context are of the [[Globalization|globalized]] world order and the technological advances that have come with it. Also, this wave is a transition of the fall communism&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|17}} to more complex issues of new kinds of 'warfare'{{Clarify|reason=What does this mean by "warfare"?  Also, this whole sentence is oddly worded but I don't understand what it's trying to say well enough to rewrite it.|date=November 2018}}, threats and violence. This new wave also "embraces ambiguity"&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|16}} and introduced a feminist approach of '[[intersectionality]]' that includes the issues of race, gender, age, and class.&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|17}} Other than that, the third wave marks a period of feminism dealing with [[identity politics]], body politics as well as the issues of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lind | first = Amy (Lecturer) | title = Gender and International Affairs 2013: International Feminist Movements | url = http://graduateinstitute.ch/directory?detail=people/faculty/lind | location = Geneva, Switzerland | publisher = Lecture conducted from [[The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] (IHEID) | date = 2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the VAW movement was initiated in the 1970s where some feminist movements started to bring the discussion on the issue of violence into the feminist discourse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Eng | first = Phoebe | author-link = Phoebe Eng | title = Stopping the violence against women: the movement from intervention to prevention | url = http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Ms_StoppingVAWTheMovementFromInterventionToPrevention_Aug2005.pdf | format = pdf | page = 2 | publisher = [[Ms. Foundation for Women]] | location = New York | date = August 2005 | series = A Safety Program Report | access-date = 3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that many other groups, on the national as well as international levels, had attempted to push for the betterment of women through lobbying of the state officials and delegates, demanding the conferences on 'gender issues'&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013" /&gt; and thus made the VAW known to a wider range of population. Therefore, to put this into the theoretical context, VAW can be categorized along with the second and third waves of feminism which share a focus on violence.

VAW activist movements come in many forms, operating at international, national, and local levels&lt;ref name="Youngs_368325" /&gt; and utilizing different approaches based on health and human rights frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Alice M. | title = Sexuality, violence against women, and human rights: women make demands and ladies get protection | journal = [[Health and Human Rights]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 16&amp;ndash;47 | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/4065347 | jstor = 4065347 | date = 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/4065347 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movements stemmed mostly from social movements and groups of women who see the need to create organizations to 'lobby' their governments to establish "sanctuaries, shelters" and provision of services that help protecting these victims, also called "battered women", from acts of violence. The term "battered women" was used in a number of VAW movements and had its root in the early stage of organizing efforts to tackle the problem of violence against women in many regions of the world such as Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin American and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|94}} The activist organizations against VAW, some with and the others without the support of their governments, attempted to develop "innovative efforts" to assist battered women by providing them services such as shelters and centers; drafting and lobbying governments to include the recognition and language of VAW into national legislations and [[international human rights instruments]]; advocating to raise the awareness of people via education and training sessions; forming national, regional as well as international networks to empower the movements; organizing demonstrations and gathering more efforts to end violent acts against women.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|88–89}} In addition, many women's rights activist groups see the issue of violence against women as a central focus of their movements. Many of these groups take a human rights approach as the integral framework of their activism. These VAW movements also employ the idea that "women's rights are human rights", transform the concepts and ideas of human rights, which are mostly reckoned to be "[[Western world|Western]] concepts" and '[[Vernacularization|vernacularize]] them into the concepts that can be understood in their local institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Merry | first = Sally Engle | title = Transnational human rights and local activism: mapping the middle | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 108 | issue = 1 | pages = 38&amp;ndash;51 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1525/aa.2006.108.1.38 | date = March 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1525/aa.2006.108.1.38 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}}

=== Levels of activist movements ===

On the local or national level, the VAW movements are diverse and differ in their strategic program of intervention. The strategies used in a number of the movements focus on the individual level with the emphases on individuals, relationships and family. Also, many of them take the 'preventive' as an approach to tackle the issues on the ground by encouraging people to "reexamine their attitudes and beliefs" in order to trigger and create fundamental changes in these "deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors".&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 95–109"/&gt; Despite the fact that these strategies can be life changing, helpful to those who participate and feasible over a long time frame, the effects on societal level seem to be restricted and of minimal effects. In order to achieve the objectives of the movement, many activists and scholars argue that they have to initiate changes in cultural attitudes and norms on a communal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heise | first1 = L. | last2 = Gottemoeller | first2 = M. | title = Ending violence against women | journal = Population Reports | volume = L | issue = 11 | page = 38 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Population and Information Program | url = https://vawnet.org/sites/default/files/assets/files/2016-10/PopulationReports.pdf | date = December 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of activism on the local level can be seen in South Africa. The movements of VAW in this context employ a strategy that is based on the 'prevention' approach, which is applicable on individual and societal levels: in families and communities. This movement encourages the individuals and small populations to rethink their attitudes and beliefs in order to create a possibility to alter these deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors, which lead to the acts of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"/&gt; Another example is the local level movement in East Africa that employs the prevention approach, which is applicable on a communal level. They call this a "raising voices" approach. This approach employs an 'ad hoc' framework that can be used alongside the individual approach where the strategy is to aggravate the status quo issues onto the individuals' and communities' perception and establish a common ground of interests for them to push for the movement, all in a short time period.&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"/&gt; In addition, on the domestic level, there seems to be many 'autonomous movements.'&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt; feminist movements (for VAW) can be understood as "a form of women's mobilization that is devoted to promoting women's status and well-being independently of political parties and other associations that do not have the status of women as their main concern".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

A number of regions of the world have come together to address violence against women. In South America, the Southern Cone Network Against Domestic Violence has worked extensively to address sexual and domestic violence since 1989. The Latin American and Caribbean Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, formed in 1990, includes representation from twenty-one different countries and has been instrumental in increasing the visibility of VAW.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|88}} In September 1999, the Heads of States of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) met and drafted the "Prevention and Eradication of Violence Against Women and Children", a document condemning violence against women and children, and resolved a set of 13 methods of addressing it, reaching into the legal; social, economic, cultural, and political; social service; and education, training, and awareness building sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = SADC| title = The prevention and eradication of violence against women and children | journal = [[Review of African Political Economy]], special issue: Violence and Conflict Resolution in Africa | volume = 26 | issue = 81 | pages = 415&amp;ndash;417 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/03056249908704404 | jstor = 4006468 | date = September 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/03056249908704404 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the transnational or regional level, the anti-violence movements also deploy different strategies based on the specificities of their cultures and beliefs in their particular regions. On this level, the activist movements are known as "transnational feminist networks" or TFNs.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}} The TFNs have a significant effect, like the autonomous movements on the national level, in shaping sets of policies as well pushing for the recognition and inclusion of language of VAW in the United Nations human rights mechanisms: the international human rights agreements.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt; Their activities are ranging from lobbying the policy makers; organizing demonstrations on the local and regional levels; to creating institutional pressure that could push for changes in the international institutional measures.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

On an international level, the movements that advocate for women's rights and against VAW are the mixture of (civil society) actors from domestic and regional levels. The objectives of these VAW movements focus on "creating shared expectations" within the domestic and regional levels as well as "mobilizing numbers of domestic civil society" to create "standards in global civil society".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}} The global women's movement works to transform numbers of international conventions and conferences to "a conference on women's rights" by pushing for a "stronger language and clearer recognition" of the VAW issues. In addition, the United Nations also plays a vital role in promoting and campaigning for the VAW movements on the international level. For instance, in 2008 UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-Moon]] initiated and launched a campaign called "[[UNiTE to End Violence against Women]]". This campaign "calls on governments, civil society, women's organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire UN system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls".&lt;ref name="UNiTE_Orange"&gt;{{cite web | last = UNiTE | author-link = UNiTE to End Violence against Women | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131220093826/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action | archive-date = 20 December 2013 |url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action |title=Take action to Orange your day |publisher=[[UN Women]] |date= 2013 | accessdate = 20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this campaign also announces every 25th of the month to be "Orange Day" or "a day to take action to raise awareness and prevent violence against women and girls".&lt;ref name="UNiTE_Orange" /&gt;

In conclusion, each level of activism is intertwined and has the common purpose to end violence against women. Activism on local levels can significantly affect national, transnational, and international levels as well. In a scholarly article on ''Combating Violence Against Women'', the authors illustrated from their research analysis on how the norms of international society can shape and influence policy making on the domestic or national level and vice versa. They argue that there are three mechanisms which have effects on the making of national policies as well as global agreements and conventions: "1) the influence of global treaties and documents such as [[CEDAW]] on women's rights" - on the national policies "2) the influence of regional agreements on VAW (particularly after certain tipping points are reached)" - on both domestic policies and international conventions and "3) regional demonstration effects or pressure for conformity captured as diffusion within regions" - on the international norms and agreements.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

=== Achievements of the VAW movements ===
On the global level:
* The first major document that highlights the recognition of violence against women as a human rights violation: the United Nations [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in Vienna, 1993.&lt;ref name="Brown Thompson 2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown Thompson | first = Karen | chapter = Women's rights are human rights | editor-last1 = Khagram | editor-first1 = Sanjeev | editor-last2 = Riker | editor-first2 = James V. | editor-last3 = Sikkink | editor-first3 = Kathryn | title = Restructuring world politics: transnational social movements, networks, and norms | pages = 96&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780816639076 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Elman | first = R.

As before the other human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch did not focus on the issue of VAW and did not consider rape and domestic violence as violations of human rights despite of the fact that they also have agenda on women's rights.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;
* The 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations |title=Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/pdf/BDPfA%20E.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=United Nations | date = 1995 |accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 4th Women Conference, VAW was emphasized and named as a critical concern. Also, the spillover effect was that this push highlighted the need for the development of "new international norms" that have often been used by activists and governments the proposition of legislation that provide other action to redress the acts of violence.&lt;ref name="Brown Thompson 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weldon, S.L 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Fábián | editor-first = Katalin | title = Domestic violence in postcommunist states: local activism, national policies, and global forces | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington, Indiana| year = 2010 | isbn = 9780253222183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subsequently, the push from the global feminist movement also push for the fully incorporation of the VAW issues into the "Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women" or [[CEDAW]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = CEDAW | author-link = CEDAW |title=Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/committee.htm |publisher=[[United Nations]] |date=31 December 2003 |accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the "original text of [[CEDAW]] in 1979 did not explicitly mention violence against women".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}}

On the regional level:
* ''Americas'': the Inter-American Convention on Violence Against Women, which was formally announced and adopted by the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1994, immediately after the Vienna Conference&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|557}}
* ''Europe'': The [[European Union]] (EU)'s initiatives to combat violence against women after the 1990s: the 1997 resolution calling for a zero tolerance: specifically on UN human rights instruments of [[CEDAW]] and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action|Vienna Declaration]].
** The [[Council of Europe]] also developed "a series of initiatives" related to the issue of VAW: "the 2000 resolution on trafficking, the 2003 resolution on domestic violence, and the 2004 resolution on honor crimes" as well as promoted "the 2002 recommendation on the protection of women against violence and established its monitoring framework".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|557}}
* ''Africa'': 
** There emerged a series of regional meetings and agreements, which was triggered by the UN processes on the international level such as Third World Conference on Women in Nairobi, 1985; the 1993 Kampala Prep Com; the 1994 Africa-wide UN women's conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tripp | first1 = Aili Mari | last2 = Casimiro | first2 = Isabel | last3 = Kwesiga | first3 = Joy | last4 = Mungwa | first4 = Alice | title = African women's movements: transforming political landscapes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780511479014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that led to the identification of VAW as a critical issue in the Southern African Women's Charter.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|557}}

==Access to justice for female victims of violence==

===International and regional instruments===
Efforts to fight violence against women can take many forms and access to justice, or lack thereof, for such violence varies greatly depending on the justice system. International and regional instruments are increasingly used as the basis for national legislation and policies to eradicate violence against women.

The Inter-American Convention to Prevent, Eradicate and Punish Violence Against Women – also known as the Belém do Parà Convention, for instance, has been applied by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in its first case of domestic violence to condemn Brazil in the Maria da Penha case. This led the Brazilian government to enact in 2006 the Maria da Penha Law, the country's first law against domestic violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spieler | first = Paula | title = The Maria da Penha Case and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights: contributions to the debate on domestic violence against women in Brazil | journal = [[Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 121&amp;ndash;143 | publisher = [[Indiana University Maurer School of Law]] | date = Winter 2011 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/445824 | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also, for instance, the South Asian Agreement on Regional Cooperation's (SAARC) Protocol to End Trafficking in Women and Children.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

===Examples of measures put in place===
As violence is often committed by a family member, women first started by lobbying their governments to set up shelters for domestic violence survivors. The Julia Burgos Protected House established in Puerto Rico in 1979 was the first shelter in Latin America and the Caribbean for "battered women". In 2003, 18 out of the 20 countries in the region had legislation on domestic or family violence, and 11 countries addressed sexual violence in their laws. Legislative measures to protect victims can include restraining orders, which can be found in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Venezuela, Turkey, the United States and many western European countries for instance.

Courts can also be allowed by law (Germany, 2001) to order the perpetrator to leave the home so that victims do not have to seek shelter. Countries were urged to repeal discriminatory legislation by 2005 following the review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2000. Egypt, for instance, abolished a law that exempted men from rape charges when marrying their victims. However, the goal of antiviolence legislation is often to keep the families together, regardless of the best interests of women, which perpetuate domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

Innovative measures have been pioneered in a number of countries to end violence against women. In Brazil and Jordan, [[women's police stations]] have been introduced, and one-stop [[women's shelter]]s were created in Malaysia and Nicaragua.

[[Marital rape]] has been illegal in every American state and the District of Columbia since 1993, but is rarely prosecuted in America.&lt;ref name="rainn.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Marital rape | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131201082952/http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape | archive-date = 1 December 2013 |url=http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape |website=rainn.org | publisher = [[Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network]] (RAINN) |date= |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[UN General Assembly]] passed its first resolution calling for the protection of defenders of women's human rights.&lt;ref name="Norway Post" /&gt; The resolution urges states to put in place gender-specific laws and policies for the protection of women's human rights defenders and to ensure that defenders themselves are involved in the design and implementation of these measures, and calls on states to protect women's human rights defenders from reprisals for cooperating with the UN and to ensure their unhindered access to and communication with international human rights bodies and mechanisms.&lt;ref name="awid.org"/&gt;

=== Challenges faced by women in accessing justice and limitations of measures ===
There can be a de jure or de facto acceptance of violent behaviors and lack of remedies for victims.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

*'''Lack of criminalization:''' in many places, acts of abuse, especially acts such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[marital rape]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]], are not criminalized, or are illegal but widely tolerated, with the laws against them being rarely enforced. There are instances where crimes against women are also categorized as minor offenses.

*'''Lack of awareness of the existing laws:''' in many places, although there are laws against violence on the books, many women do not know of their existence. This is especially the case with marital rape - its criminalization being very recent in most countries.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

*'''Challenges in making a case in court:''' the burden of proof can be placed on the victim. For instance in the Philippines, before a change in law in 1997, rape used to be described as a crime against chastity; and virginity played an important role in court. In various countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], a woman's past sexual experience continues to be very important in a case of rape. Bangladesh has received criticism for its employment of the "two-finger test" in rape investigations. This test consists in a physical examination of women who report rape during which a doctor inserts two fingers in the woman's vagina to determine whether the woman is "habituated to sex". This examination has its origin in the country's British colonial-era laws dating back to 1872. This deters many women from reporting rape. More than 100 experts, including doctors, lawyers, police, and women's rights activists had signed a joint statement in 2013 asking for the test, which they called "demeaning", to be abolished, as it "does not provide any evidence that is relevant to proving the offence". This test is also performed in several other countries in the region, including India.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

On the other hand, there are measures, such as the 2012 law in Brazil, that allow for cases to be filed even without the representation of the victim.

*'''Existing laws are insufficient, conflicting, and have no effect in practice:''' some laws on domestic violence, for instance, conflict with other provisions and ultimately contradict their goals. Legal frameworks can also be flawed when laws that integrate protection do so in isolation, notably in relation to immigration laws. Undocumented women in countries where they would have, in theory, access to justice, don't in practice for fear of being denounced and deported. The CEDAW Committee recommends that a State authority's obligation to report undocumented persons be repealed in national legislation.

*'''The attitude of the police:''' women who report acts of violence most often come into contact first with police workers. Therefore, police attitudes are crucial in facilitating a sense of safety and comfort for women who have been victimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Logan | first1 = T.

Measures to address violence against women range from access to legal-aid to the provision of shelters and hotlines for victims. Despite advances in legislation and policies, the lack of implementation of the measures put in place prevents significant progress in eradicating violence against women globally. This failure to apply existing laws and procedures is often due to the persisting issue of gender stereotyping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = CEDAW | author-link = CEDAW | title = General discussion on women and access to justice | url = http://wilpf.org/cedaw-general-discussion-on-women-and-access-to-justice/ | publisher = [[United Nations]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | date = 18 February 2013 | accessdate = 12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The legal rights of access that married partners have to each other's persons, property, and lives makes it all but impossible for a spouse to defend herself (or himself), or to be protected against torture, rape, battery, stalking, mayhem, or murder by the other spouse... Legal marriage thus enlists state support for conditions conducive to murder and mayhem."

==Istanbul Convention==
The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, is the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of domestic violence and violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bureau des Traités |url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG |title=Liste complète |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Countries which ratify it must ensure that the forms of violence defined in its text are outlawed. In its Preamble, the Convention states that "the realisation of ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' equality between women and men is a key element in the prevention of violence against women". The Convention also provides a definition of [[domestic violence]] as "all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that occur within the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim".&lt;ref name="Istanbul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe – Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|work=coe.int|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is a Convention of the [[Council of Europe]], it is open to accession by any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221131635/http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1613">'''Wardrobing''' is a form of [[return fraud]]. It is the practice of purchasing an item, using it, and then returning it to the store for a refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kim|first1=Eun Kyung|title=Bloomingdale's new b-tags block used clothing returns|url=http://www.today.com/money/bloomingdales-new-b-tags-block-used-clothing-returns-4B11199683|accessdate=2 April 2015|agency=Today Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Daisy|title=Wardrobing: why returning worn clothes is the latest fashion|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/05/wardrobing-returning-worn-clothes-fashion-return-fraud-stores|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most often done with expensive clothing - hence the name - but the practice is also common with tools, electronics, and even computers. To prevent this practice, some stores make certain items, such as wedding dresses or Christmas decorations unreturnable. Some observers classify wardrobing as a form of [[shoplifting]].

[[File:Benidorm19.jpg|thumb|200px|When shoppers purchase items with the intention of using them and then returning them, this is called "wardrobing."]]

==Examples==
Perhaps one of the most notorious examples of wardrobing comes from the film ''[[My Date With Drew]]'', which was filmed entirely on a wardrobed video camera. The filmmaker purchased the camera from [[Circuit City (1949–2009 company)|Circuit City]], used it for 30 days to film his movie, and then returned the camera for a full refund.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5580">The '''Williston Negotiation Competition''' is an annual [[negotiation]] and [[contract|contract drafting]] competition at [[Harvard Law School]] for the 1L class.

Students work in paired teams of two, with each team representing a side in a complex business deal. At the end of the competition, each pair of teams submits a single contract, and each side submits a private memo to its client explaining why the client should accept the agreement.

The competition is judged by experienced negotiators from private practice and the [[Program on Negotiation|Harvard Program on Negotiation]]. Teams are evaluated on three basic factors: value creation, value claiming, and contract drafting. Prizes are awarded to the team pairing that produces the best overall agreement as well as the two teams that best represent the interests of their respective sides in the negotiation.

Now in its 61st year, the competition honors [[Samuel Williston]], professor at Harvard Law School from 1895 to 1938 and author of a classic [[legal treatise|treatise]] on contracts.

The 11th [[World Trade Organization]] [[Ministerial Conference]] was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 11 to 13 December 2017. It was chaired by Minister Susana Malcorra of Argentina. The Conference ended with a number of ministerial decisions, including on fisheries subsidies and e-commerce duties, and a commitment to continue negotiations in all areas. The conference also led to the formation of working party to enable faster induction of South Sudan in the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/mc11_e/mc11_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
