The '''ACEA agreement''' refers to a voluntary agreement between the [[European Automobile Manufacturers Association]] (ACEA) and the [[European Commission]] to limit the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emitted by passenger cars sold in Europe. With 18 million cars sold each year, Europe is the last major car market{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=what do you mean "last"?}} in the world.

Signed in 1998, the agreement sought to achieve an average of 140 g/km of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by 2008 for new [[passenger vehicle]]s sold by the association's cars in Europe. This target represents a 25% reduction from the 1995 level of 186&amp;nbsp;g/km and is equivalent to a [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] of 5.8&amp;nbsp;L/100&amp;nbsp;km or 5.25&amp;nbsp;L/100&amp;nbsp;km for petrol and diesel engines respectively. However, the average for the whole car market for 2008 was 153.7&amp;nbsp;g/km, so the target has not been achieved.

Besides the agreement with ACEA, the European Commission also closed agreements with the [[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] (JAMA) and [[Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association]] (KAMA). However, for the latter two the target date is 2009 instead of 2008 and as ACEA accounts for 86.4% of car sales in Europe,&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/co2/pdf/cars_ia_final_report.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} PDF&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of the latter two is much smaller.

The ultimate EU target to which these agreements are to contribute, is to reach an average CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission (as measured according to Commission Directive 93/116/EC&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31993L0116:EN:HTML EUR-Lex - 31993L0116 - EN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) of 130&amp;nbsp;g/km for all new passenger cars by 2015.

The European Commission announced in late 2006 that it is working on a proposal for legally binding measures and limits.

In February 2007, the Commission acknowledged the failure of the voluntary agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the Result of the review of the Community strategy to reduce {{CO2}} emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, a proposal of regulation was introduced by the Commission on 19 December 2007.

==Implementation==
The agreement defines [[Fleet vehicles|fleet]]-average CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission targets from new cars sold in the European Union, to be reached collectively by the members of the association. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the only gas covered by the agreements, other [[greenhouse gas]] emissions are currently not controlled (see [[carbon dioxide equivalent]]). How the target is to be achieved is not specified, and are expected by the Commission to be mainly by technological developments and market changes linked to these developments.

Apart from the 140&amp;nbsp;g/km target, the ACEA should evaluate in 2003 the potential for additional improvements with a view to moving further towards the objective of emission targets:

* In the range of 165-170&amp;nbsp;g/km CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 2003.
* 140&amp;nbsp;g/km of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by 2008.
* 130&amp;nbsp;g/km of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by 2015.

Concerning costs, a report for the European Commission last year showed that the cost of meeting the target for new cars of 120&amp;nbsp;g/km of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would be on average €577 per car,&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt; which could be earned back in a few years time due to the improved fuel economy implied in the reductions.

==Progress towards the target==

[[Fiat]] has already reached the 2008 goal, 3 year in advance (achieving 139&amp;nbsp;g/km). [[Citroen]] (144&amp;nbsp;g/km) and [[Renault]] (149&amp;nbsp;g/km) are on track to meet the 140&amp;nbsp;g/km commitment in 2008. [[Ford]] (151&amp;nbsp;g/km) and [[Peugeot]] (151&amp;nbsp;g/km) are almost on track. These brands were also relatively good performers in 1997 and yet still managed to reduce their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions significantly.

Only two brands were able to reach the 2008 planned goal of 140&amp;nbsp;g/km: Fiat, with a value of 133.7&amp;nbsp;g/km and Peugeot, with 138.1&amp;nbsp;g/km. The Fiat Auto Group (including the Fiat, [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Lancia]], [[Abarth]], [[Ferrari]] and [[Maserati]] brands) was the only group to reach the planned value, averaging 138.4&amp;nbsp;g/km. The average for the whole car market for 2008 is 153.7&amp;nbsp;g/km, so the target has not been achieved.

===2009 report &lt;ref name="jato2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jato.com/PressReleases/Small%20Cars%20Driving%20Down%20European%20CO2%20Emissions.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102154806/http://www.jato.com/PressReleases/Small%20Cars%20Driving%20Down%20European%20CO2%20Emissions.pdf |archivedate=2 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;===
More brands reached the (now expired) 2008 140&amp;nbsp;g/km goal: Fiat (127.8&amp;nbsp;g/km), [[Toyota]] (130.1&amp;nbsp;g/km), Peugeot (133.6&amp;nbsp;g/km), [[Renault]] (137.5&amp;nbsp;g/km), Citroen (137.9&amp;nbsp;g/km) and [[Ford]] (140.0&amp;nbsp;g/km). Fiat, however, was the only brand to reach the 2015 goal of 130&amp;nbsp;g/km, 6 years in advance. The Fiat Auto Group (including the Fiat, [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Lancia]], [[Abarth]], [[Ferrari]] and [[Maserati]] brands) averaged to 131.0&amp;nbsp;g/km.

For the fourth year running, Fiat Automobiles is the brand that has recorded the lowest level of {{CO2}} emissions by vehicles sold in Europe in 2010 as certified by the company JATO Dynamics. Fiat posted a mean value of 123.1&amp;nbsp;g/km and it also ranked first as Group, with 125.9&amp;nbsp;g/km and an improvement of 5 g/km compared to last year.

===2011 report &lt;ref name="jato2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jato.com/PressReleases/Europe%20cleaning%20up%20act%20as%20car%20CO2%20targets%20loom.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524020924/http://www.jato.com/PressReleases/Europe%20cleaning%20up%20act%20as%20car%20CO2%20targets%20loom.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;===
For the fifth year running, Fiat Automobiles is the brand that has recorded the lowest level of {{CO2}} emissions by vehicles sold in Europe in 2011 as certified by the company JATO Dynamics. Fiat posted a mean value of 118.2&amp;nbsp;g/km, the first and only brand to reach the 120&amp;nbsp;g/km value, while other seven brands were able to reach the 130&amp;nbsp;g/km value. The average for the whole car market is 136.1&amp;nbsp;g/km.

===2012 report &lt;ref name="jato2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jato.com/PressReleases/Europe%20continues%20to%20clean%20up%20act%20as%20car%20CO2%20targets%20loom,%20with%20Fiat%20retaining%20the%20overall%20European%20crown.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704004202/http://www.jato.com/PressReleases/Europe%20continues%20to%20clean%20up%20act%20as%20car%20CO2%20targets%20loom%2C%20with%20Fiat%20retaining%20the%20overall%20European%20crown.pdf |archivedate=4 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;===
For the sixth year running, Fiat Automobiles is the brand that has recorded the lowest level of {{CO2}} emissions by vehicles sold in Europe in 2012 as certified by the company JATO Dynamics. Fiat posted a mean value of 119.8&amp;nbsp;g/km, still the only brand to reach the 120&amp;nbsp;g/km value, while other eight brands were able to reach the 130&amp;nbsp;g/km value. The average for the whole car market is 132.3&amp;nbsp;g/km.

==Longer-term target==
The Commission will support research efforts towards reaching the European Road Transport Research Advisory Council (ERTRAC)&lt;ref&gt;See ERTRAC Strategic Research Agenda, December 2004, available at: {{cite web|url=http://www.ertrac.org/publications.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220230420/http://www.ertrac.org/publications.htm |archivedate=20 February 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; research target of "Improvements in vehicle efficiency [that] will deliver as much as a 40% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions for passenger cars for the new vehicle fleet in 2020". This would correspond to a new car fleet average of 95&amp;nbsp;g/km of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (COM/2007/19).

Some environmental groups insist on the need for a [[longer-term]] target that doubles [[fuel efficiency]] of new cars over the next decade, 80&amp;nbsp;g/km of C0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportenvironment.org/docs/Press/2007/2007_02_12_te_letter_environment_council.pdf|title=Letter Re: transport and climate change policies in Environment Council of 20 February in Brussels|last=|first=|date=December 2, 2007|website=European Federation for Transport and Environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2259">"'''Actually existing capitalism'''" or "'''really existing capitalism'''" is an ironic term used by critics of [[neoliberalism]] and [[capitalism]], used to claim that many economies purportedly practicing capitalism (an economic system characterized by a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[free market]] system) actually have significant state intervention and partnerships between private industry and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, Sean. ''Marxism and Human Nature''. Routledge. 1998. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saree Makdisi, Cesare Casarino, Rebecca E. Karl. ''Marxism Beyond Marxism''. Routledge, 1996. p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[mixed economy]] is also used to describe economies with these attributes. The term seeks to point out discrepancy between capitalism as normally defined and what is labelled as capitalism in practice, and to claim that capitalism as defined is not desirable, pointing to the use of regulation in avoiding economic problems such as acute [[commodities]] fluctuations, financial market crashes, [[Monopoly|monopolies]], and extensive environmental damage. 

== Capitalism defined ==
Capitalism is defined as an economic system with the following attributes:
* Informed consumers making rational decisions regarding their purchases
* Perfect competition, which results in (1) easy entry and access to the marketplace; and (2) long run profits and surpluses not being possible, although short term booms may be.

=== Technical problems with capitalism in practice ===
Critics of capitalism as in the above definition hold that perfect competition is only theoretical, and that any economy that claims to be capitalist is actually some other type of economic system, i.e. only has some capitalist features. Further, current understandings of economics would need to incorporate this impossibility of such capitalism, no longer using the definition of capitalism as a starting point with which to analyze an economy. In this sense, the term can be understood as a critique of the methods of the economics discipline generally, and specifically of the [[Austrian School]] or the [[Chicago school of economics]].

'''Agnes Chow Ting''' ({{zh-t|周庭}}; born 3 December 1996) is a Hong Kong social activist. She is the member of the Standing Committee of [[Demosistō]] and former spokesperson of [[Scholarism]]. Initially a candidate supported by the [[Pro-democracy camp]] for the [[Hong Kong Island by-election, 2018|2018 Hong Kong Island by-election]], she was barred from running based on her party's stance on advocating democratic [[self-determination]].

==Early activism==
She first came to spotlight in the anti-[[Moral and National Education]] movement as the spokesman of student activist group [[Scholarism]] in 2012. She was a Form 6 student at the Holy Family Canossian College and protested against the implementation of the Moral and National Education scheme which they deemed as "brainwashing". The movement successfully drew thousands of protesters gathered in front of the [[Central Government Complex]] which led to the backdown of the government in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://varsity.com.cuhk.edu.hk/index.php/2013/11/liberal-studies-politcal-participation/|title=

After the Moral and National Education, Chow and other activists of Scholarism including [[Joshua Wong]] and Ivan Lam continued their involvement in social and political movements, notably the [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform]]. Chow was one of the leaders in the [[2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign|class boycott campaign]] against the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|restrictive electoral framework]] set by the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] on the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2017|2017 Chief Executive election]], which led to the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|massive Occupy protests]] dubbed the "Umbrella Revolution". During the occupation, Chow announced her stepping out of the politics by resigning as spokesperson of Scholarism, citing the "heavy pressure" and "extreme confusion and fatigue" she was facing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview: Scholarism’s Agnes Chow urges Hongkongers to adopt new solutions in fight for democracy|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/09/27/interview-scholarisms-agnes-chow-urges-hongkongers-to-adopt-new-solutions-in-fight-for-democracy/|date=27 September 2015|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demosistō==
In April 2016, she was among one of the founding members of [[Demosistō]] with other former student leaders in the Occupy protests and was the first deputy secretary-general of the party from 2016 to 2017. She campaigned with party chairman [[Nathan Law]] in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016|2016 Legislative Council election]], in which the latter was elected as the youngest member of the Legislative Council in history. In 2017, she participated in the protest during the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]], in which they covered the [[Golden Bauhinia Square|Golden Bauhinia statue]] with banners. She was arrested along with Demosistō chairman Nathan Law and secretary-general Joshua Wong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong police arrest democracy activists ahead of Xi Jinping visit|date=28 June 2017|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/28/joshua-wong-nathan-law-arrested-ahead-of-xi-jinping-hk-handover-visit.html|work=[[CNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:香港眾志談立法會補選形勢3.jpg|thumb|right|Agnes Chow campaigned with [[Nathan Law]] for the [[Hong Kong Island by-election, 2018|2018 Hong Kong Island by-election]].]]
After Nathan Law was ejected from the Legislative Council over the [[Hong Kong LegCo oath-taking controversy|oath-taking controversy]] in July 2017 and sentenced to imprisonment in August at same year, which barred Law from being candidate of public offices for 5 years, Chow became Demosistō's candidate in the [[Hong Kong Island by-election, 2018|2018 Hong Kong Island by-election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=

On 27 January 2018, her candidacy was disqualified by the Electoral Affairs Commission on the basis of that she "cannot possibly comply with the requirements of the relevant electoral laws, since advocating or promoting 'self-determination' is contrary to the content of the declaration that the law requires a candidate to make to uphold the [[Basic Law]] and pledge allegiance to the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong activist Agnes Chow banned from Legco by-election|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2130714/hong-kong-activist-agnes-chow-banned-legco-election|date=27 January 2018|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;Tom Phillips, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/27/hong-kong-authorities-block-pro-democracy-candidate-from-byelection "Hong Kong authorities block pro-democracy candidate from byelection"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 27 January 2018 (page visited on 27 January 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; Several legal experts expressed misgivings about the decision, leading [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]] to comment that "any suggestion of Hong Kong independence, self-determination, independence as a choice or self-autonomy is not in line with Basic Law requirements and deviates from the important principle of '[[one country two systems]].'"&lt;ref&gt;Kimmy Chung, Tony Cheung, [http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2130714/hong-kong-activist-agnes-chow-banned-legco-election "Political storm in Hong Kong as activist Agnes Chow banned from by-election over party’s call for city’s 'self-determination'."] Additional reporting by Emily Tsang.

== Controversies ==
Growing media scrutiny of the ATC came as a result of allegations made by [[FBI]] whistleblower [[Sibel Edmonds]] regarding the activities of council members in an article in the September 2005 [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]. The improprieties were alleged to be illegal contributions to the [[Congressional Black Caucus Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= The Turkish Lobby &amp; the Congressional Black Caucus |url= http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2010/02/18/the-turkish-lobby-the-congressional-black-caucus/ |work= [[Boiling Frogs Post]] |date= February 18, 2010 |accessdate= July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ATC is where former Ambassador Joseph Wilson met his future wife and CIA operative, [[Valerie Plame]], leading some to speculate Plame's CIA front company, [[Brewster-Jennings &amp; Associates]], was monitoring the same alleged nuclear trafficking of the ATC as Sibel Edmonds.

In 2014, James Holmes, ATC President since 2005, was forced to resign at the demand of Turkey's deputy prime minister [[Ali Babacan]]. ATC Deputy Head Canan Büyüküstün and Executive Manager Ayşe Sümer also submitted their resignations. This was a result of the ATC having issued a report citing media reports about the 2013 [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey|corruption probe]] in Turkey that had implicated members of the AKP Erdoğan government. Concerns were subsequently raised by Cüneyt Zapsu, former Erdogan advisor and executive member of the ATC's partner organization in Turkey, the Turkey-U.S. Business Council (TAİK), an arm of Turkey's Foreign Economic Relations Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/top-american-turkish-council-officials-resign-over-corruption-probe-row.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=67314&amp;NewsCatID=345]&lt;/ref&gt; Further dislike of Holmes by the Turkish government was caused when, 
at an discussion panel chaired by Holmes, AKP-affiliated journalists, acting as if they were still in Turkey where such behavior would be normal, refused to answer a question posed by a [[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]] journalist. Holmes rebuked this refusal, insisting that the AKP-columnist answer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2014/06/turkey-akp-criticism-pressure-american-turkish-council.html ''AKP on warpath against American-Turkish Council'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andhra Mahasabha''' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]: ఆంధ్ర మహాసభ, [[IAST]]: ''Āndhra mahāsabha'') was a people's organisation in the erstwhile [[Hyderabad state]] of [[India]]. Started under the name '''Andhra Janasangham''' (Andhra People's Society) in 1921, the Andhra Mahasabha spearheaded people's awareness and people's movements among the [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-speaking populace of the state and eventually joined hands with the [[Communist Party of India]] to launch the [[Telangana movement]].

== History ==
There was an increase in political and cultural awareness among people of Hyderabad State at the end of 19th century. As the culture and language of the overwhelming majority of the people living in Hyderabad State was sought to be suppressed by the State rulers, the natural desire for education and cultural development, for protection and development of [[Telugu language|their other tongue]] would become a basic doctrinal plank of armed struggle against the Nizam's rule.

A triggering incident that led to the kindling of Telugu people's self-respect in Hyderabad state occurred on 12 November 1921, in the Nizam State "social conference" when a Telugu lawyer, Mr. Allampalli Venkata Rama Rao, spoke in [[Telugu Language|Telugu]] on a resolution. Allampalli Venkata Rama Rao was heckled and shouted at by those in attendance in the audience, among whom were speakers who earlier spoke freely in English, [[Urdu]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. This event is thought to have mobilized the sentiment of Telugu-language speakers and the perception of that language's "true position" in Hyderabad State .

That night witnessed the creation of the "Andhra Jana Sangham" with the stated intention of promoting Telugu language, [[Telugu literature|literature]], its books and [[Telugu language#history|historical research]], with eleven members led by [[Suravaram Pratapareddy]], [[Madapati Hanumantha Rao]], [[Komarraju Venkata Lakshmana Rao]], [[Duvvuri Subbamma]] and others.

Within two years, fifty branches of the Andhra Jana Sangham were established throughout the Telangana region. By 1923, Madapati Hanumantha Rao played a vital role in the central organisation of all the branches into the "Nizam Rashtra Andhra Jana Kendra Sangham".

Regular conferences were held during 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1928.

During the 1930 conference, the Andhra Jana Sangham changed its name to the '''Andhra Mahasabha'''. The Andhra Mahasabha, formed in 1930, pushed for the social and cultural development of the people of [[Telangana]].

Its first conference was held in 1930 at Jogipet in Medak district under the presidency of Suravaram Pratap Reddy. A women's conference called the Andhra Mahila Sabha was held simultaneously with the Andhra Maha Sabha under the presidency of Nadimpalli Sundaramma. Burgula Ramakrishna Rao presided over the second conference held at Devarakonda in 1931. The Nizam's government, deriving its "legitimacy" from [[Islamist]] bigotry and [[racism|racist contempt]] for Telugu-speaking Hindus, developed a hostile attitude towards the Mahasabha and imposed several restrictions on it. As a consequence, the Mahasabha could not obtain "permission" for three years until it held its third conference, at [[Khammam]], in 1934, under the presidency of Pulijala Venkata Ranga Rao.

== The Fourth Andhra Mahasabha At Sircilla 1935 ==
The fourth Andhra Mahasabha, held at [[Sircilla]] in [[Karimnagar district]], was presided over by [[Madapati Hanumantha Rao]] in 1935, while his wife Manikyamba presided over the Andhra Mahila Sabha simultaneously at the same place. The speakers started speaking in Telugu in this conference giving up Urdu, Marathi and English. A primary form for the constitution of Andhra Mahasabha was given in this conference. Many important resolutions were passed in this conference.

:1. Education system should be completely revised and the educational institutions should be recognised.
:2. [[Compulsory education|Compulsory]] [[primary education]] should be implemented.
:3. [[Mother-tongue]] Telugu should be the [[medium of instruction]].
:4. The legitimate rights of the people in ''[[Jagir]]s'' should be protected.
:5. [[Child marriages]] should be discouraged.
:6. Local-self Government should be introduced.
:7. [[Untouchability]] should be eradicated and the untouchables should be given due place in the society.

The leaders like [[Baddam Yella Reddy]], [[Anabheri Prabhakar Rao]], Singireddy Bhoopathi Reddy and the social reformer Bhoomaiah vakil (pleader) played important role in organising this conference. Representatives from all the taluks of the district attended this conference. From Jagtial Kasam Shivaraja Gupta, Jaisetty Lakshmirajam Gupta and Siddamsetti Sangaiah etc. attended it. The branch of Andhra Mahasabha was opened by Kasam Shivaraja Gupta at Jagtial. Raghunath Kache, who attended this conference, established the Andhra Mahasabha branch at Manthani. After the conference of [[Sircilla]], a permanent office of Andhra Maha Sabha was opened at Boiwada in [[Karimnagar]]. Baddam Yella Reddy was elected as the District president of Mahasabha, while [[Anabheri Prabhakar Rao]] was elected as secretary. Damodar Rao of Gundi-Ramadugu was put in charge of the office. The branches of Andhra Maha Sabha were opened at [[Sircilla]], Jagtial, Manthani, Peddapalli, Metpalli, Koratla, Choppadandi, Sultanabad, [[Huzurabad]] and several other places in [[Karimnagar district]].

The popular leaders like K.V.Ranga Reddy, J.V.Narasing Rao, [[Suravaram Pratap Reddy]], [[Raavi Narayana Reddy]], Baddam
Yella Reddy etc. participated in the Sircilla conference on 6 September 1935. The famous weight lifter Kodi Rama Krishna of Vijayawada is said to have exhibited his feats in this conference.

The offices of Andhra Mahasabha opened in the district carried on a campaign against Vetti Chakiri or forced labour, compulsory levy system of paddy and the exploitation of the masses by the privileged class like [[landlords]], [[Jagirdars]] and [[Deshmukhs]]. The Volunteers of the Mahasabha helped the weavers in getting the cotton thread supplied by the Government on ration cards. They worked for the fair distribution of the cotton thread without allowing scope for black marketing.

== The Later Conferences of Andhra Mahasabha ==
The fifth conference of Andhra Mahasabha was held at [[Jagir]] village Shadnagar in 1936 under the presidency of Konda Venkata Ranga Reddy. The sixth conference held at [[Nizamabad, Andhra Pradesh|Nizamabad]] in 1937 was presided over by Mandamula Narsinga Rao. When the Seventh conference was presided over by Mandamula Ramachandar Rao at Malkapur, young men like [[Raavi Narayan Reddy]] from [[Nalgonda]], Kaloji Narayan Rao from [[Warangal]] and Polkampalli Venkatrama Rao from [[Karimnagar]] attended it. The delegates were divided into two distinct groups namely moderates and leftists. The eighth conference held at Chilkuru near Huzurnagar in [[Nalgonda district]] in 1941 was presided over by the Communist leader [[Raavi Narayana Reddy]]. The problems of women and the agricultural tenants were mainly discussed in this conference. The Ninth Andhra Mahasabha conference held in 1942 at Dharmavaram in [[Warangal district]] was presided over by Madiraju Rama Koteswara Rao. In 1943 the Tenth conference was held in Hyderabad. Konda Venkata Ranga Reddy belonging to moderates group having defeated the leftist leader Baddam Yella Reddy of [[Karimnagar district]] became the president of this conference. In the eleventh conference held at Bhuvanagiri in 1944 the communists dominated and their leader [[Raavi Narayan Reddy]] became the president. This Andhra Mahasabha attended by ten thousand people came under the control of communists. The communist leader Chandra Rajeshwar Rao addressed this eleventh session. This led to a split in the Mahasabha. Moderates like Konda Venkata Ranga Reddy and others formed a separate association called the Nationalist Andhra Mahasabha which held two sessions in 1945 and 1946. The last session of the Nationalist Andhra Mahasabha held at Kandi Village in [[Medak district]] in 1946 was presided over by Jamalapuram Keshava Rao. However the Nationalist Andhra Mahasabha ultimately merged itself into the Hyderabad State congress.

The Communist led Andhra Mahasabha held its twelfth session at Khammam in 1946 under the presidency of [[Raavi Narayan Reddy]]. More than forty thousand people attended this conference. On 3 December 1946 the communist party was banned and naturally the activities of Andhra Mahasabha came to a close.

== The Telangana Rebellion ==
{{main article|Telangana Rebellion}}
The last [[Nizam]], [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]] was very notorious for the strengthening of [[feudalism]] in the [[Hyderabad state]]. The feudal lords, nobles and other government officials, known as [[Razakars (Hyderabad)|Razakars]] exploited the poor peasants and workers of their wealth, property, land and many times raped their ladies. Common people had no way other than depending on the landlords' mercy for basic needs like food, shelter and clothing. This situation made the people very angry. Many [[communist]] leaders of the region inspired by the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] have decided to overthrow the [[Nizam]]'s rule.

Sri [[Madapati Hanumantha Rao]] started '''Andhra MahaSabha'''. It was in 1928 that the Andhra Mahasabha was organised
under the leadership of Sri Madapati Hanumantha Rao and others. Its first conference was held in Jogipeta in 1930 under the
chairmanship of Suravaram Pratapa Reddy. In conferences, it used to pass resolutions demanding certain reforms in the
administrative structure, for more schools, for certain concessions for the landed gentry, for certain civil liberties, but did not try to mobilise the people and launch struggles against the oppressors or against the Nizam's Government. But it became in those
wretched and tremendously oppressive conditions in Hyderabad state, a forum, a focal point for the rising democratic aspirations of
the people. (written by Sri [[Puchalapalli Sundaraiah]] in his book 'Telangana People's struggles and its lessons')

The [[Communist Party of India]] organised a peasant led armed rebellion against the cruel rule of [[Nizam]] landlords under the banner of '''Andhra Mahasabha'''. Few among the well-known individuals at the forefront of the movement were great leaders like Pendyala Satyanarayana Rao, [[Kaloji Narayana Rao]], [[Pendyala Raghava Rao]], [[Anabheri Prabhakar Rao]], [[Puchalapalli Sundaraiah]], [[Chandra Rajeswara Rao]], [[Raavi Narayana Reddy]], the Urdu poet [[Makhdoom Mohiuddin]], [[Hassan Nasir]], [[Bhimreddy Narasimha Reddy]], [[Mallu Venkata Narasimha Reddy]], [[Mallu Swarajyam]], [[Arutla Ramchandra Reddy]] and his wife [[Arutla Kamala bai]]. The rebellion is historically famous as the [[Telangana Rebellion]] and ended in October 1951.

The [[Comrades Association]] played an influential role in the guiding the Mahasabha.

The '''Apostolic Nuncio to Prussia''' was the ambassador of the [[Holy See]] to the [[Free State of Prussia]]. He was based in [[Berlin]]. 

==History==
It was founded in 1925 by [[pope Pius XI]] at the request of the [[Weimar Republic]], which intended to give greater prominence to Berlin's Catholics. Such a nunciature had been mooted since the 1871 constitution of the [[German Empire]], but the strong Protestant presence, the support of the kings of Prussia and emperors of Germany, the lack of clear support for such a nunciature from the Holy See and opposition from Austria delayed its inauguration. By this time, there was also already long standing nunciatures to [[Apostolic Nunciature to Germany|Germany]] and [[Apostolic Nunciature to Bavaria|Bavaria]], usually both held by the same man. The German states lost their independence on 30 January 1934 and the nunciature in Berlin was officially closed as a result. It was not revived after [[World War II]].

==List==
*1925–19 August 1929 - [[Eugenio Pacelli]], titular archbishop of Sardis, also apostolic nuncio in Bavaria (1917 to 24 January 1925) and in Germany (1920-1928), later [[pope Pius XII]]
*1930–31 May 1934 - [[Cesare Orsenigo]], titular archbishop of Tolemaide, apostolic internuncio to The Hague (1922-1925), nuncio in Budapest (1925-1930), nuncio in Germany (1930-1945)

'''''Ballot Monkeys''''' is a 2015 British comedy series which appeared on [[Channel 4]] in the run up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]]. The five-part series was set on [[campaign bus]]es belonging to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and [[UK Independence Party]] featuring groups of mid-level party campaign organisers as each embarks on their respective election campaigns.

The series was written by [[Andy Hamilton]] and [[Guy Jenkin]]. Episodes were written and produced within hours of transmission, allowing the characters to react to recent real-world events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32215513 |title=Ben Miller to star in election comedy |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=8 April 2015 |accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The series cuts between the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and UKIP buses. Apart from a brief phone call at the end of the last episode, these groups do not interact with each other. All scenes are shot inside or in the immediate vicinity of the campaign buses, and much of the humour comes from the candidates talking candidly in private about their party and campaign in ways that they would not do in public. In each party there are interpersonal conflicts between individuals.

===Conservatives===
In the Conservative group nominal leader Martin ([[Hugh Dennis]]), a frustrated [[One-nation conservatism|one-nation conservative]], clashes with the well-connected Baz ([[Jimmy Akingbola]]), the latter of which openly supports what he considers to be [[Boris Johnson]]'s inevitable rise to power and is far more willing to engage in more cynical campaign ploys. Women's issues consultant Siobhan ([[Hattie Morahan]]) feels marginalised by both men. The group is completed by dim-witted and politically uninformed intern Ruby (Liz Kingsman), who the group is forced to employ as she is the daughter of a major party donor.

===Labour===
In the Labour group Jack ([[Trevor Cooper]]), a long time party supporter, is confused and dismayed by how the party, politics and campaigning has changed. Social media organiser Conor (Theo Barklem-Biggs) continually suggests unhelpful online strategies, mostly to the chagrin of co-ordinator Christine ([[Daisy Haggard]]). The advice of American political strategy consultant Melanie ([[Kathleen Rose Perkins]]), who is frequently depicted trying to secure a future job in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election campaign]], grates with her English colleagues.

===Liberal Democrats===
Liberal Democrat Kevin ([[Ben Miller]]), dismayed at the poor electoral prospects of his party, the last five years of [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]], and a recent divorce, suffers a nervous breakdown, showing increasingly erratic behaviour as the series progresses. Assistant Charlotte ([[Esther Smith]]), tries to help, but party grandee Simon ([[Michael Fenton Stevens]]) repeatedly refuses to acknowledge that a problem exists.

===UKIP===
In the UKIP bus, communications manager Gerry ([[Andy Nyman]]), a UKIP supporter on purely [[Eurosceptic]] grounds, struggles to prevent political damage arising from offensive comments and behaviour of other UKIP members. This includes those of openly bigoted logistics manager Kate ([[Sarah Hadland]]). The bus is driven by Obi ([[Rhashan Stone]]), a friendly and resourceful Somalian immigrant. Gerry and Obi strike up a friendship, bonding over a mutual love of [[Star Wars]], while Kate views him with suspicion due to his race. Gerry is forced to fire Obi after he learns he is an [[Illegal immigration in the United Kingdom|illegal immigrant]], and his replacement Mick ([[Steven O'Donnell (actor)|Steven O'Donnell]]) is far more aligned with Kate's bigoted worldview.

==''Power Monkeys''==
{{main|Power Monkeys}}
A sequel series, ''[[Power Monkeys]]'' began airing on 8 June 2016. While retaining the same up-to-the-minute production style, the new series focuses more broadly on current events, such as the EU referendum or the American election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/power-monkeys-the-new-political-sitcom-is-written-on-the-day-of-broadcast-to-ensure-maximum-a7070126.html|title=Power Monkeys is written on the day of broadcast to ensure maximum topicality|date=2016-06-08|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11125">{{Recep Tayyip Erdogan sidebar}}
During the [[Erdoğan Cabinet (disambiguation)|Recep Tayyip Erdoğan government]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, civil–military relationship moved towards normalization in which the influence of the military was reduced. During its nine-year reign, the ruling [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]], or AK Party, has often faced off against the military, gaining political power by challenging a pillar of the country’s laicistic establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=civil-military-ties-in-akp-rule---akp-series-part-3-2010-11-02 |first=Serkan |last=Demirtaş  |work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |title=Civil-military ties enter new era in Turkey under AKP rule |date=November 2, 2010 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling party, which came to power following the [[Turkish general election, 2002|November 3, 2002 general elections]], is not the first government to have tangled with the military in Turkey, where the powerful [[Turkish Armed Forces]], or TSK, has periodically carried out [[coup d'état|coups d’état]] since the 1960s. But the shift in the balance of power in civil-military ties has been one of the most important changes the AK Party has made to Turkey’s political landscape.

Under the party’s tenure, the military, while it remains suspicious of the motives of the AK Party, has become much less enthusiastic about making public statements on political issues and more cooperative in efforts to further align Turkey’s standards to those of the [[European Union]] even when such moves would curb the TSK’s own powers.

== Chiefs of the General Staff during Erdoğan's term of office ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hilmiozkok.jpg|200px|thumb|Hilmi Özkök]] --&gt;
The following persons served as [[Chief of the General Staff (Turkey)|Chief of the General Staff]] between 2002 and 2011:
* [[Hilmi Özkök]] (2002-2006)
* [[Yaşar Büyükanıt]] (2006-2008)
* [[İlker Başbuğ]] (2008-2010)
* [[Işık Koşaner]] (2010-2011)
* [[Necdet Özel]] (2011-2015)
* [[Hulusi Akar]] (2015-present)

== History ==

=== Rise of Justice and Development Party ===
Since the [[Cabinet Gül|first AK Party government]] in late 2002, the military, which sees itself as the guardian of the laicistic, democratic and republican Turkish state, monitored what it saw as a “pro-Islamic party” aiming to undermine the country’s laicistic regime. The military had successfully challenged the Islamic [[Welfare Party]] in 1996, overthrowing the government of prime minister [[Necmettin Erbakan]] following the months-long struggle known as the [[February 28 process]]. The process resulted in Erbakan’s resignation from the government and the dissolution of his party by the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Constitutional Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/24/world/turkish-court-to-rule-on-future-of-former-premier-s-islamic-party.html?src=pm |author=[[Stephen Kinzer]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Turkish Court to Rule on Future of Former Premier's Islamic Party |date=November 24, 1997 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, however, the political landscape was not as favorable for military influence in politics. The first reason for this shift was the [[European Union]] [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|membership process]], which nurtured the notion of [[democratization]] in the country; another was the [[Turkish general election, 2002|election victory of the AK Party]] that brought this “democratic conservative party” a clear majority in [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Parliament]] in 2002. Having seen what the political choices of many of its members led to in the past, the AK Party resolved to be firm in confronting the military this time around.

Negotiating for membership in the European Union, which was highly critical of the military’s influence in politics, no doubt strengthened the AK Party's hand. The three-party coalition that previously led the country had already taken initial steps in 2001 and 2002 to stem this influence, helping prepare a suitable environment for the AK Party to further move against the political influence of the military.

“Since 1999, civilian control of the military has been strengthened. The constitutional and legal framework has been amended to clarify the position of the armed forces versus the civilian authorities,” the European Union said in its 2004 Progress Report on Turkey, which cited various developments with regard to civil-military ties. “A number of changes have been introduced over the last year to strengthen civilian control of the military with a view to aligning it with practice in EU member states.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/ds750_03014tur.pdf |work=[[European Commission]] |title=2004 Progress Report on Turkey |date=October 5, 2004 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the coalition party had amended the law governing the National Security Council, or MGK, turning the country’s top security board into an advisory board with an increased number of civilian members. The AK Party further amended the duties and composition of the [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council]] in 2003, a move that paved the way for the appointment of a civilian secretary and reduced the frequency of the council’s meetings to once every two months.

In an attempt to strengthen Parliament’s supervision over the military’s budget concerning defense expenditures, the government initiated amendments to the Law on Public Financial Management and Control in 2003. Though there are still difficulties in implementing these amendments, the change established a new base for full parliamentary oversight of [[List of countries by military expenditures|defense expenditures]]. In addition, it was under the government of the AK Party that the military’s budget became smaller than the education budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://yenisafak.com.tr/Politika/?t=31.08.2008&amp;c=2&amp;i=151265 |work=[[Anatolian Agency]] |publisher=[[Yeni Şafak]] |place=Sinop |title=Bir numaralı bütçe Eğitim'e |date=November 19, 2008 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, an amendment made to the Military Criminal Code prevented military courts from trying civilians in peacetime unless military personnel and civilians commit a crime together. That was followed by legislation in 2009 that allowed civilian courts to try military personnel in peacetime for crimes subject to the Heavy Penal Court. In 2010, the EMASYA protocol, a secret blueprint that allowed the military to conduct operations for internal matters under certain conditions without a request from civilian authorities, was annulled with the consent of the chief of General Staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5f7ccb5c-11f5-11df-b6e3-00144feab49a.html#axzz1NUPP6D9I |author=Delphine Strauss |work=[[Financial Times]] |place=Ankara |title=Turkey tries to rebuild confidence in military |date=February 5, 2010 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a constitutional amendment approved by the people in a [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2010|referendum]] paved the way for military personnel expelled through [[Supreme Military Council (Turkey)|Supreme Military Council]], or YAŞ, decisions to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/106965/-39-yes-39-39-no-39-in-dead-heat-ahead-of-turkish-referendum.html |author=İzgi Güngör |work=[[Journal of Turkish Weekly]] |place=Ankara |title='Yes,' 'No' in Dead Heat Ahead of Turkish Referendum |date=September 2, 2010 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== April 27 memorandum ===
{{Main|E-memorandum}}
Despite the AK Party’s legal moves to diminish the means by which the military could interfere in the political field, the army continued to exercise significant political influence. Chiefs of General Staff, force commanders and lesser-ranking military personnel did not hesitate to express their opinions on domestic and foreign policy issues, many of which were critical of the government.

The biggest issue that caused deep fissures between the army and the government was the midnight [[e-memorandum]] posted on the military’s website objecting to the selection of [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Foreign Minister]] [[Abdullah Gül]] as the ruling party’s [[Turkish presidential election, 2007|candidate for the Presidency]] in 2007. The military argued that the election of Gül, whose wife wears an Islamic headscarf, could undermine the laicistic order of the country.

Contrary to expectations, the government responded harshly to former Chief of General Staff Gen. [[Yaşar Büyükanıt]]’s e-memorandum, saying the selection of the presidential candidate had nothing to do with the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200704/s1909091.htm |author=Reuters |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |title=Turkish govt slams army threat |date=April 28, 2007 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This challenge was followed by a confidential meeting between Büyükanıt and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at Dolmabahçe Palace.

Despite all the tension, Gül was eventually elected [[President of Turkey|president]], becoming the first head of Turkey whose wife is covered. This has continued to be an issue between Gül and the military, as top generals have avoided participating in official events where First Lady [[Hayrünnisa Gül]] would also be present.

=== Prosecutions ===
{{Main|Sledgehammer (coup plan)|Ergenekon (organization)|Ergenekon trials}}
The ruling party has backed prosecutors who launched judicial proceedings against senior military personnel, including former four-star generals, in regard to alleged coup plots against the government in 2003 and 2004. As part of the Ergenekon and ''Balyoz'' (Sledgehammer) cases, hundreds of retired and active-duty military personnel, as well as other prominent figures, have been arrested by prosecutors on charges of attempting to overthrow the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2010/02/201022516176575355.html |author=[[Anita McNaught]] |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |title=Turkey's 'sledgehammer plot' |place=Istanbul |date=February 26, 2010 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cases marked the first time such high-ranking military personnel had been accused of anti-democratic moves and prosecuted by civilian prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-229887-turkey-challenges-sledgehammer-coup-plot-in-historic-trial.html |first=Büşra |last=Erdal |work=[[Today's Zaman]] |title=Turkey challenges Sledgehammer coup plot in historic trial |place=Istanbul |date=December 17, 2010 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenhouse gas removal]] approaches, of which [[carbon dioxide removal]] represents the most prominent subcategory addresses the cause of global warming by removing [[greenhouse gases]] from the [[atmosphere]]. Solar radiation management attempts to offset effects of greenhouse gases by causing the [[Earth]] to absorb less [[solar radiation]].

Climate engineering approaches are sometimes viewed as additional potential options for limiting [[climate change]] or its impacts, alongside [[mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] and [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18988/climate-intervention-reflecting-sunlight-to-cool-earth|doi = 10.17226/18988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Royal Society|url = https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf|website = royalsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is substantial agreement among scientists that climate engineering cannot substitute for [[climate change mitigation]].

Most experts and major reports advise against relying on climate engineering techniques as a main solution to global warming, in part due to the large uncertainties over effectiveness and side effects. However, most experts also argue that the risks of such interventions must be seen in the context of risks of dangerous global warming.&lt;ref name="perspectives"&gt;{{cite book

==History==
{{See also|History of climate change science}}
The 1965 landmark report, "Restoring the Quality of Our Environment" by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Science Advisory Committee warned of the harmful effects of fossil fuel emissions, the report also mentioned "deliberately bringing about countervailing climatic changes," including by "raising the albedo, or reflectivity, of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/09/03/geoengineering-a-short-history/|title=Geoengineering: A Short History|year=2013|publisher=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Teller|Teller]] et al. 1997 suggested to research and deploy reflective particles, to reduce incoming solar radiation, and thus to cancel the effects of fossil fuel burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/labs/caldeiralab/Caldeira%20downloads/Teller_etal_LLNL231636_1997.pdf|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|year=1997|title=Global Warming and Ice Ages: Prospects For Physics-Based Modulation Of Global Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Proposed strategies==
{{See also|List of proposed geoengineering schemes}}
Several climate engineering strategies have been proposed. IPCC documents detail several notable proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/CLIMATE/IPCC_TAR/wg3/176.htm |title=IPCC Third Assessment Report – Climate Change 2001 – Complete online versions &amp;#124; UNEP/GRID-Arendal – Publications – Other |publisher=[[UNEP/GRID-Arendal]] |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927031948/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2FCLIMATE%2FIPCC_TAR%2Fwg3%2F176.htm |archivedate=2012-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fall into two main categories: [[solar radiation management]] and [[carbon dioxide removal]].

===Solar radiation management===
{{Main|Solar radiation management}}
{{See also|Stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|Marine Cloud Brightening}}
Solar radiation management (SRM)&lt;ref name="Royal Society Policy Document" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehardlook.typepad.com/thehardlook/files/schnare_supplemental_testimony_a_framework_for_geoengineering.pdf Proposed Outline for Solar Radiation Management (Geoengineering) Framework&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; techniques would seek to reduce sunlight absorbed ([[ultra-violet]], near [[infra-red]] and [[visible light|visible]]).  This would be achieved by deflecting sunlight away from the Earth, or by increasing the reflectivity ([[albedo]]) of the atmosphere or the Earth's surface. These methods would not reduce [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations in the [[atmosphere]], and thus would not seek to address problems such as the [[ocean acidification]] caused by [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. In general, solar radiation management projects presently appear to be able to take effect rapidly and to have very low direct implementation costs relative to greenhouse gas emissions cuts and carbon dioxide removal.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Furthermore, many proposed SRM methods would be reversible in their direct climatic effects. While [[greenhouse gas remediation]] offers a more comprehensive possible solution to global warming, it does not give instantaneous results; for that, solar radiation management is required.{{dubious|date=March 2013}}

Solar radiation management methods&lt;ref name="Royal Society Policy Document" /&gt; may include:
* Surface-based: for example, protecting or expanding polar sea ice and glaciers,&lt;ref&gt;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016EF000410&lt;/ref&gt; using [[Reflective surfaces (geoengineering)|pale-colored roofing materials]], attempting to change the oceans' brightness, or growing high-albedo crops.
* Troposphere-based: for example, [[Cloud reflectivity modification|marine cloud brightening]], which would spray fine [[sea water]] to whiten clouds and thus increase cloud reflectivity.
* Upper atmosphere-based: creating reflective [[aerosols]], such as [[stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|stratospheric sulfate aerosols]], specifically designed [[photophoresis|self-levitating]] aerosols,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16428.full |title=Photophoretic levitation of engineered aerosols for geoengineering |journal=PNAS |accessdate=2012-05-16 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1009519107 |volume=107 |issue=38 |pages=16428–16431 | last1 = Keith | first1 = D. W.|bibcode=2010PNAS..10716428K |year=2010 |pmc=2944714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or other substances. 
* Space-based: [[space sunshade]]—obstructing [[solar radiation]] with space-based mirrors, dust,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bewick | first1 = R. | last2 = Sanchez | first2 = J.

===Carbon dioxide removal===
{{Main|Carbon dioxide removal|Greenhouse gas remediation|Carbon sequestration}}
{{Refimprove|date=June 2013}}[[File:Phytoplankton SoAtlantic 20060215.jpg|upright|thumb|An oceanic [[phytoplankton]] bloom in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], off the coast of [[Argentina]]. The aim of ocean [[iron fertilization]] in theory is to increase such blooms by adding some iron, which would then draw [[carbon]] from the atmosphere and fix it on the seabed.]]
[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Significant reduction in ice volume in the Arctic Ocean in the range between 1979 and 2007]]

Carbon dioxide removal (sometimes known as negative emissions technologies or greenhouse gas removal) projects seek to remove carbon dioxide from the [[atmosphere]].  Proposed methods include those that directly remove such gases from the atmosphere, as well as indirect methods that seek to promote natural processes that draw down and sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (e.g. tree planting).  Many projects overlap with [[carbon capture and storage]] projects, and may not be considered to be climate engineering by all commentators. Techniques in this category include:
* Creating [[biochar]], which can be mixed with soil to create [[terra preta]]
* [[Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]] to sequester carbon and simultaneously provide energy
* [[Carbon air capture]] to remove [[carbon dioxide]] from ambient air
* [[Afforestation]], [[reforestation]] and [[forest restoration]] to absorb carbon dioxide
* [[Ocean fertilization]] including [[iron fertilization]] of the oceans

Many of the IPCC model projections to keep global mean temperature below 2C, are based on scenarios assuming deployment of negative emissions technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-experts-assess-the-feasibility-of-negative-emissions|title=In-depth: Experts assess the feasibility of ‘negative emissions’|year=2016|publisher=CarbonBrief}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justification==

===Tipping points and positive feedback===
[[File:65 Myr Climate Change.png|thumb|300px|right|Climate change during the last 65 million years. The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum is labelled PETM.]]
It is argued that [[climate change]] may cross [[tipping point (climatology)|tipping points]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lenton | first1 = T.

The precise identity of such "tipping points" is not clear, with scientists taking differing views on whether specific systems are capable of "tipping" and the point at which this "tipping" will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchpages.net/ESMG/people/tim-lenton/tipping-points/ |title=Tipping points in the Earth system |publisher=ResearchPages.net |date=2005-10-06 |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a previous tipping point is that which preceded the rapid warming leading up to the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]]. Once a tipping point is crossed, cuts in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will not be able to reverse the change. Conservation of resources and reduction of greenhouse emissions, used in conjunction with climate engineering, are therefore considered a viable option by some commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662|title= We're Running the Risk of Unstoppable Climate Change|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081213183527/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662|archivedate= 2008-12-13|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081213183527/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42662 |archivedate=2008-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/global-warming-now-unstoppable-scientists-warn-702979.html | work= The Independent | location=London | title=Global warming now 'unstoppable', scientists warn | first=Charles | last=Arthur | date=2001-01-23 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buying time===
Climate engineering offers the hope of temporarily reversing some aspects of global warming and allowing the natural climate to be substantially preserved whilst greenhouse gas emissions are brought under control and removed from the [[atmosphere]] by natural or artificial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Geoengineering could buy the time needed to develop a sustainable energy economy|url = http://thebulletin.org/has-time-come-geoengineering/geoengineering-could-buy-time-needed-develop-sustainable-energy-economy|website = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
Estimates of direct costs for climate engineering implementation vary widely. In general, carbon dioxide removal methods are more expensive than the solar radiation management ones. In their 2009 report ''Geoengineering the Climate'' the [[Royal Society]] judged afforestation and stratospheric aerosol injection as the methods with the "highest affordability" (lowest costs). More recently, research into costs of solar radiation management have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McClellan | first1 = J. | last2 = Keith | first2 = D.

Such costs would be within the budget of most nations, and even some wealthy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/content/thinktank/GeoEng_041209.pdf |title=Unilateral Geoengineering |publisher=CFR |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate engineering would represent a large-scale, intentional effort to modify the climate. It would differ from activities such as burning fossil fuels, as they change the climate inadvertently. Intentional climate change is often viewed differently from a moral standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bodansky | first1 = D | year = 1996 | title = May we engineer the climate? | url = | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 309–321 | doi=10.1007/bf00142579 | bibcode=1996ClCh...33..309B}}&lt;/ref&gt; It raises questions of whether humans have the right to change the climate deliberately, and under what conditions. For example, there may be an ethical distinction between climate engineering to minimize global warming and doing so to optimize the climate. Furthermore, ethical arguments often confront larger considerations of worldview, including individual and social religious commitments.  This may imply that discussions of climate engineering should reflect on how religious commitments might influence the discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clingerman | first1 = F. | last2 = O'Brien | first2 = K. | year = 2014 | title = Playing God: why religion belongs in the climate engineering debate | url = | journal = [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] | volume = 70 | issue = 3| pages = 27–37 | doi=10.1177/0096340214531181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For many people, religious beliefs are pivotal in defining the role of human beings in the wider world. Some religious communities might claim that humans have no responsibility in managing the climate, instead seeing such world systems as the exclusive domain of a Creator.  In contrast, other religious communities might see the human role as one of "stewardship" or benevolent management of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Clingerman, F. (2012) "Between Babel and Pelagius: Religion, Theology and Geoengineering," in Preston, C. (ed.), ''Engineering the Climate: The Ethics of Solar Radiation Management''. Lantham, MD: Lexington, pp. 201–219.&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of ethics also relates to issues of policy decision-making.  For example, the selection of a globally agreed target temperature is a significant problem in any climate engineering [[governance]] regime, as different countries or interest groups may seek different global temperatures.&lt;ref name = geoengineering_option&gt;Victor, D. G., M. G. Morgan, J. Apt, J. Steinbruner, K. Ricke (2009) "The Geoengineering Option: A last resort against global warming?" ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', March/April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics ===
It has been argued that regardless of the economic, scientific and technical aspects, the difficulty of achieving concerted political action on global warming requires other approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/dec/12/environment-climate-change-poznan | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Let's get real on the environment | date=2008-12-12 | accessdate=2010-03-30 | first=David | last=Appell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those arguing political expediency say the difficulty of achieving meaningful emissions cuts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/24/opinion/24caldiera.html?_r=2&amp;ref=opinion&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=How to Cool the Globe | first=Ken | last=Caldeira | authorlink=Ken Caldeira | date=2007-10-24 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effective failure of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] demonstrate the practical difficulties of achieving carbon dioxide [[emissions reduction]] by the agreement of the [[international community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Extreme and risky action the only way to tackle global warming, say scientists | first=David | last=Adam | date=2008-09-01 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others point to support for climate engineering proposals among think tanks with a history of [[global warming skepticism]] and opposition to emissions reductions as evidence that the prospect of climate engineering is itself already politicized and being promoted as part of an argument against the need for (and viability of) emissions reductions; that, rather than climate engineering being a solution to the difficulties of emissions reductions, the prospect of climate engineering is being used as part of an argument to stall emissions reductions in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/009784.html |title=Evaluation + Tools + Best Practices: Geoengineering and the New Climate Denialism |publisher=Worldchanging |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups such as [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]]&lt;ref name="ETC"&gt;{{cite web|title=ETC website|url=http://www.etcgroup.org/issues/climate-geoengineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals such as [[Raymond Pierrehumbert]] have called for a moratorium on climate engineering techniques.&lt;ref name="worldchanging1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csmonitor1"&gt;[http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2008/07/16/can-we-engineer-a-cooler-earth/ ''Can we engineer a cooler earth?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ineffectiveness===
The effectiveness of the techniques proposed may fall short of predictions. In ocean [[iron fertilization]], for example, the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the [[atmosphere]] may be much lower than predicted, as carbon taken up by [[plankton]] may be released back into the atmosphere from dead plankton, rather than being carried to the bottom of the sea and sequestered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Author | first1 =  | year = 2007| title = Seasonal rhythms of net primary production and particulate organic carbon flux to depth describe the efficiency of biological pump in the global ocean | url = | journal = [[Journal of Geophysical Research]] | volume = 112 | issue = | page = C10011 | doi = 10.1029/2006JC003706 | bibcode=2007JGRC..11210011L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model results from a 2016 study, suggest that blooming algae could even accelerate Arctic warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/algae-accelerate-arctic-warming-18929|title=Blooming Algae Could Accelerate Arctic Warming|year=2016|publisher=ClimateCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2&lt;/ref&gt;  This has generally been called a potential [[Moral Hazard|moral hazard]], although [[risk compensation]] may be a more accurate term. This concern causes many environmental groups and campaigners to be reluctant to advocate or discuss climate engineering for fear of reducing the imperative to cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="Moral hazard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celsias.com/article/geo-engineering-a-moral-hazard/|title=Geo-Engineering – a Moral Hazard|date=14 November 2007|publisher=celsias.com|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several public opinion surveys and focus groups have found evidence of either assertions of a desire to increase emission cuts in the face of climate engineering, or of no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

==Governance==
{{See also|Solar radiation management#Governance}}Climate engineering opens up various political and economic issues. The governance issues characterizing carbon dioxide removal compared to solar radiation management tend to be distinct. Carbon dioxide removal techniques are typically slow to act, expensive, and entail risks that are relatively familiar, such as the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from underground storage formations. In contrast, solar radiation management methods are fast-acting, comparatively cheap, and involve novel and more significant risks such as regional climate disruptions. As a result of these differing characteristics, the key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) is making sure actors do enough of it (the so-called "[[free rider problem]]"), whereas the key governance issue for solar radiation management is making sure actors do not do too much (the "free driver" problem).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/sjoe.12120 | volume=117 | issue=4 | title=A Voting Architecture for the Governance of Free-Driver Externalities, with Application to Geoengineering | journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics | pages=1049–1068 | last1 = Weitzman | first1 = Martin L.| year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic and international governance vary by the proposed climate engineering method. There is presently a lack of a universally agreed framework for the regulation of either climate engineering activity or research. The [[London Convention (1972)|London Convention]] addresses some aspects of the law in relation to [[List of proposed geoengineering schemes|biomass ocean storage]] and [[ocean fertilization]]. Scientists at the [[Oxford Martin School]] at [[Oxford University]] have proposed a set of voluntary principles, which may guide climate engineering research. The short version of the 'Oxford Principles'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rayner | first1 = S. | last2 = Heyward | first2 = C. | last3 = Kruger | first3 = T. | last4 = Pidgeon | first4 = N. | last5 = Redgwell | first5 = C. | last6 = Savulescu | first6 = J. | title = The Oxford Principles | doi = 10.1007/s10584-012-0675-2 | journal = Climatic Change | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = | volume=121 | issue = 3 | pages=499–512}}&lt;/ref&gt; is:
*Principle 1: Geoengineering to be regulated as a [[public good]].
*Principle 2: Public participation in geoengineering decision-making
*Principle 3: Disclosure of geoengineering research and [[open access publication|open publication]] of results
*Principle 4: Independent assessment of impacts
*Principle 5: Governance before deployment
These principles have been endorsed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] Science and Technology [[Select Committee]] on “The Regulation of Geoengineering”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oxford Geoengineering Programme // History of the Oxford Principles|url = http://www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk/oxford-principles/history/|website = www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-03|author=Oxford Geoengineering Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been referred to by authors discussing the issue of governance.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/15814427 We all want to change the world]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Asilomar conference]] was replicated to deal with the issue of climate engineering governance,&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt; and covered in a [[TV documentary]], broadcast in Canada.

==Implementation issues==
There is general consensus{{Who|date=May 2017}} that no climate engineering technique is currently sufficiently safe or effective to greatly reduce climate change risks, for the reasons listed above. However, some may be able to contribute to reducing climate risks within relatively short times.

All proposed solar radiation management techniques require implementation on a relatively large scale, in order to impact the Earth's climate. The least costly proposals are budgeted at tens of billions of US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18988/climate-intervention-reflecting-sunlight-to-cool-earth|doi = 10.17226/18988|first = National Research|last = Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Space sunshade]]s would cost far more. Who was to bear the substantial costs of some climate engineering techniques may be hard to agree. However, the more effective solar radiation management proposals currently appear to have low enough direct implementation costs that it would be in the interests of several single countries to implement them unilaterally.

In contrast, carbon dioxide removal, like greenhouse gas emissions reductions, have impacts proportional to their scale. These techniques would not be "implemented" in the same sense as solar radiation management ones. The problem structure of carbon dioxide removal resembles that of emissions cuts, in that both are somewhat expensive [[public good]]s, whose provision presents a [[Collective action|collective action problem]].

Before they are ready to be used, most techniques would require technical development processes that are not yet in place. As a result, many promising proposed climate engineering do not yet have the engineering development or experimental evidence to determine their feasibility or efficacy.

==Public perception==
In a 2017 focus group study conducted by the [[Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences]] (CIRES) in the United States, Japan, New Zealand and Sweden, participants were asked about carbon sequestration options, reflection proposals such as with space mirrors, or brightening of clouds, and their majority responses could be summed up as follows:
*What happens if the technologies backfire with unintended consequences?
*Are these solutions treating the symptoms of climate change rather than the cause?
*Shouldn’t we just change our lifestyle and consumption patterns to fight climate change, making climate engineering a last resort?
*Isn’t there a greater need to address political solutions to reduce our emissions?
Moderators floated then the idea of a future "climate emergency" such as rapid environmental change. The participants felt that mitigation and adaptation to climate change were strongly preferred options in such a situation, and climate engineering was seen as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cires.colorado.edu/news/study-illuminates-public-perceptions-climate-engineering|date=October 9, 2017|title=Study Illuminates Public Perceptions of Climate Engineering|work=CIRES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation of climate engineering==
Most of what is known about the suggested techniques is based on laboratory experiments, observations of natural phenomena, and on [[computer modelling]] techniques. Some proposed climate engineering methods employ methods that have analogues in natural phenomena such as [[stratospheric sulfur aerosols]] and [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. As such, studies about the efficacy of these methods can draw on information already available from other research, such as that following the 1991 [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] of [[Mount Pinatubo]]. However, comparative evaluation of the relative merits of each technology is complicated, especially given modelling uncertainties and the early stage of engineering development of many proposed climate engineering methods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imeche.org/media/Public+Affairs/geoenginq.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports into climate engineering have also been published in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]&lt;ref name="imeche09"/&gt; and the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref name="roysoc09"/&gt; The IMechE report examined a small subset of proposed methods (air capture, urban albedo and algal-based {{co2}} capture techniques), and its main conclusions were that climate engineering should be researched and trialled at the small scale alongside a wider [[decarbonisation]] of the economy.&lt;ref name="imeche09"/&gt;

The Royal Society review examined a wide range of proposed climate engineering methods and evaluated them in terms of effectiveness, affordability, timeliness and safety (assigning [[qualitative data|qualitative]] estimates in each assessment). The report divided proposed  methods into "carbon dioxide removal" (CDR) and "solar radiation management" (SRM) approaches that respectively address longwave and shortwave radiation. The key recommendations of the report were that "Parties to the [[UNFCCC]] should make increased efforts towards mitigating and adapting to climate change, and in particular to agreeing to global emissions reductions", and that "[nothing] now known about climate engineering options gives any reason to diminish these efforts".&lt;ref name="roysoc09"/&gt; Nonetheless, the report also recommended that "research and development of climate engineering options should be undertaken to investigate whether low risk methods can be made available if it becomes necessary to reduce the rate of warming this century".&lt;ref name="roysoc09"/&gt;

In a 2009 review study, Lenton and Vaughan evaluated a range of proposed climate engineering techniques from those that sequester {{co2}} from the atmosphere and decrease [[outgoing longwave radiation|longwave radiation]] trapping, to those that decrease the Earth's receipt of [[shortwave radiation]].&lt;ref name="lenton09"/&gt; In order to permit a comparison of disparate techniques, they used a common evaluation for each technique based on its effect on net radiative forcing. As such, the review examined the scientific plausibility of proposed methods rather than the practical considerations such as engineering feasibility or economic cost. Lenton and Vaughan found that "[air] capture and storage shows the greatest potential, combined with afforestation, reforestation and bio-char production", and noted that "other suggestions that have received considerable media attention, in particular "ocean pipes" appear to be ineffective".&lt;ref name="lenton09"/&gt; They concluded that "[climate] geoengineering is best considered as a potential complement to the mitigation of {{co2}} emissions, rather than as an alternative to it".&lt;ref name="lenton09"/&gt;

In October 2011, a [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] panel issued a report urging immediate researching and testing in case "the [[climate]] system reaches a 'tipping point' and swift remedial action is required".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/science/earth/04climate.html "Group Urges Research Into Aggressive Efforts to Fight Climate Change"], October 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Academy of Sciences===
The [[National Academy of Sciences]] conducted a 21-month project to study the potential impacts, benefits, and costs of two different types of  climate engineering: carbon dioxide removal and albedo modification (solar radiation management). The differences between these two classes of  climate engineering "led the committee to evaluate the two types of approaches separately in companion reports, a distinction it hopes carries over to future scientific and policy discussions."&lt;ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home {{!}} The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine {{!}} National-Academies.org {{!}} Where the Nation Turns for Independent, Expert Advice|url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=02102015|website = www8.nationalacademies.org|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the two-volume study released in February 2015:&lt;blockquote&gt;Climate intervention is no substitute for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and adaptation efforts aimed at reducing the negative consequences of climate change. However, as our planet enters a period of changing climate never before experienced in recorded human history, interest is growing in the potential for deliberate intervention in the climate system to counter climate change. ...Carbon dioxide removal strategies address a key driver of climate change, but research is needed to fully assess if any of these technologies could be appropriate for large-scale deployment. Albedo modification strategies could rapidly cool the planet’s surface but pose environmental and other risks that are not well understood and therefore should not be deployed at climate-altering scales; more research is needed to determine if albedo modification approaches could be viable in the future.&lt;ref name="nas-sites.org"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Climate Intervention Reports » Climate Change at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|url = https://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/other-reports-on-climate-change/2015-2/climate-intervention-reports/|website = nas-sites.org|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The project was sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], U.S. Intelligence Community, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[NASA]], and [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]].&lt;ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/projectview.aspx?key=49540|title=  Geoengineering Climate: Technical Evaluation and Discussion of Impacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change===

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) assessed the scientific literature on climate engineering (referred to as "geoengineering" in its reports), in which it considered carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation separately. Its [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|pp = 575, 632}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Models consistently suggest that SRM would generally reduce climate differences compared to a world with elevated GHG concentrations and no SRM; however, there would also be residual regional differences in climate (e.g., temperature and rainfall) when compared to a climate without elevated GHGs....&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Models suggest that if SRM methods were realizable they would be effective in countering increasing temperatures, and would be less, but still, effective in countering some other climate changes. SRM would not counter all effects of climate change, and all proposed geoengineering methods also carry risks and side effects. Additional consequences cannot yet be anticipated as the level of scientific understanding about both SRM and CDR is low. There are also many (political, ethical, and practical) issues involving geoengineering that are beyond the scope of this report.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Democracy Center''' was founded in 2007 by [[Björn S. Stefánsson]], dr. scient., as an own enterprice in Reykjavik Academy. The Center´s main task is studies of voting and election methods emphazising ''sequential choice'' and ''fund voting'' and giving consulting service in the field. The activities are presented on the [https://www.abcd.is Democracy Center website] and by publishing books.
The aim is to make [[Sequential Choice and Fund Voting]] known the world over. This happens by publishing ''Democracy with Sequential Choice and Fund Voting'' on different languages. This also happens by making people used to take sequential choice and fund voting into account when issues are formed and then submitted for decision. Not least concerns this people in position, members of parliament and people in public administration, national and international.
 
The publishing of ''Democracy with Sequential Choice and Fund Voting'' as a research report from Political Science Institute, Oslo University, made it possible to become acquainted with sequential choice and fund voting  in a historical continuity within the theory of group choice and in the light of a different kind of empirical cases in Iceland. Although the monograph was composed to be published by an academic institute it was devised for the informed public. The monograph has been published in 17 languages, on each language as ebook and for some of the languages also in print. Moreover, Democracy Center has published as ebook instructions for the application of sequential choice and fund voting making use of sections in the monograph.

The work in Democracy Center, besides publishing, is to win experience with sequential choice and fund voting through advice and other assistance. The Center seeks associations, companies, organizations and issues where one can presume that those in responsibility would make it easier by applying sequential choice and fund voting. The Center is positive to applications for assistance and advice.

For some it may be inevitable that application of sequential choice and fund voting would alter society. The course of events will show. The issue is brought up and considered several times in ''Democracy with Sequential Choice and Fund Voting''.

==Definitions==

In this article, the phrase “climate change” is used to describe a change in the climate, measured in terms of its statistical properties, e.g., the global [[mean]] surface [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Climate can change over period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical time period is 30 years, as defined by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. The climate change referred to may be due to natural causes, e.g., changes in the sun's output, or due [[Anthropogenic hazard|human activities]], e.g., changing the composition of [[Atmosphere of Earth|the atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Public good issues==
The [[atmosphere]] is an international [[public good]] and GHG emissions are an international [[externality]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996:,21,&amp;nbsp;28,&amp;nbsp;43).&lt;ref name=goldemberg&gt;{{cite book

A change in the quality of the atmosphere, ''A'', does not affect the welfare of all individuals and countries equally. In other words, some individuals and countries may benefit from climate change, but others may lose out.

===Heterogeneity===

GHG emissions are unevenly distributed around the world, as are the potential impacts of climate change (Toth ''et al.'', 2001:607).&lt;ref name=toth&gt;{{cite book
|year=2001
|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/379.htm

|author=Toth, F.L.
|accessdate=2010-01-10|display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nations with higher than average emissions that face potentially small negative/positive climate change impacts have little incentive to reduce their emissions. Nations with relatively low levels of emissions that face potentially large negative climate change impacts have a large incentive to reduce emissions. Nations that avoid mitigation can benefit from [[free rider problem|free-riding]] on the actions of others, and may even enjoy gains in trade and/or investment (Halsnæs ''et al.'', 2007:127).&lt;ref name=halsnaes&gt;{{cite book |year=2007

|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.htm
|accessdate=2009-05-20|display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unequal distribution of benefits from mitigation, and the potential advantages of free-riding, make it difficult to secure an international agreement to reduce emissions.

===Intergenerational transfers===

Mitigation of climate change can be considered a transfer of wealth from the present generation to future generations (Toth ''et al.''., 2001:607).&lt;ref name=toth /&gt; The amount of mitigation determines the composition of resources (e.g., environmental or material) that future generations receive. Across generations, the costs and benefits of mitigation are not equally shared: future generations potentially benefit from mitigation, while the present generation bear the costs of mitigation but do not directly benefit (ignoring possible co-benefits, such as reduced air pollution). If the current generation also benefitted from mitigation, it might lead them to be more willing to bear the costs of mitigation.

==Irreversible impacts and policy==

Emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2|link=yes}}) might be irreversible on the time scale of millennia (Halsnæs ''et al.'', 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2007
|contribution=2.2.3 Irreversibility and the implications for decision-making.
|title=Framing issues |series= Climate Change 2007: Mitigation. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
|editor=B. Metz
|publisher=Print version: Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, and New York, N.Y., U.S.A.. This version: IPCC website
|isbn=978-0-521-88011-4
|author=Halsnæs, K.
|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch2s2-2-3.html
|accessdate=2010-05-23|display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are risks of irreversible climate changes, and the possibility of sudden changes in climate. On the other hand, these effects are also true of mitigation efforts. [[Investment]]s made in long-lived, large-scale low-emission technologies are essentially irreversible. If the scientific basis for these investments turns out to be wrong, they would become "stranded" assets. Additionally, the costs of reducing emissions may change over time in a [[non-linear]] fashion.

From an economic perspective, as the scale of [[private sector]] investment in low-carbon technologies increases, so do the risks. Uncertainty over future [[climate policy]] decisions makes investors reluctant to undertake large-scale investment without upfront government support. The later section on [[economics of climate change mitigation#Finance|finance]] discusses how risk affects investment in developing and emerging economies.

==Sustainable development==

Solow (1992) (referred to by Arrow, 1996b, pp.&amp;nbsp;140–141)&lt;ref name=arrow/&gt; defined [[sustainable development]] as allowing for reductions in exhaustible [[resource]]s so long as these reductions are adequately offset by increases in other resources. This definition implicitly assumes that resources can be substituted, a view which is supported by economic history. Another view is that reductions in some exhaustible resources can only be partially made up for by substitutes. If true, this might mean then some [[asset]]s need to be preserved at all costs.

In many developing countries, Solow's definition might not be viewed as being acceptable, since it could place a constraint on their ambitions for development. A remedy for this would be for developed countries to pay all the costs of mitigation, including costs in developing countries. This solution is suggested by both [[John Rawls|Rawlsian]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] constructs of the [[social welfare function]]. These functions are used to assess the [[welfare economics|welfare]] impacts on all individuals of climate change and related policies (Markandya ''et al.'', 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;460).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|year=2001 |contribution=7.2.2.2 Cost Analysis and Development, Equity, and Sustainability Aspects |title= Costing Methodologies |series=Climate Change 2001: Mitigation. Contribution of Working Group III to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editor=B. Metz

|accessdate=2010-01-10|display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rawlsian approach concentrates on the welfare of the worst-off in society, whereas the utilitarian approach is a sum of [[utility|utilities]] (Arrow ''et al.'', 1996b, p.&amp;nbsp;138).

It might be argued that since such redistributions of resources are not observed now, why would either Rawlsian or utilitarian constructs be appropriate for climate change (Arrow ''et al.'', 1996b, p.&amp;nbsp;140)? A possible response to this would point to the fact that in the absence of government intervention, market rates of redistribution will not equal social rates.

==Emissions and economic growth==

Economic growth is a key driver of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions (Sathaye ''et al.'', 2007:707).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|year=2007 |contribution=
Sustainable Development and Mitigation |title= Climate Change 2007: Mitigation. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
|editor=B. Metz
|publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, and New York, N.Y., U.S.A.
|author=Sathaye, J.
|url= http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch12s12-2-2.html
|accessdate=2009-05-20|display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the economy expands, demand for energy and energy-intensive goods increases, pushing up CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. On the other hand, economic growth may drive technological change and increase energy efficiency. Economic growth may be associated specialization in certain economic sectors. If specialization is in energy-intensive sectors, then there might be a strong link between economic growth and emissions growth. If specialization is in less energy-intensive sectors, e.g., the services sector, then there might be a weak link between economic growth and emissions growth. Unlike technological change or energy efficiency improvements, specialization in high or low energy intensity sectors does not affect global emissions. Rather, it changes the distribution of global emissions.

Much of the literature focuses on the "environmental [[Kuznets curve]]" (EKC) hypothesis, which posits that at early stages of development, pollution per capita and [[GDP per capita]] move in the same direction. Beyond a certain income level, emissions per capita will decrease as GDP per capita increase, thus generating an inverted-U shaped relationship between GDP per capita and pollution. Sathaye ''et al.''. (2007) concluded that the [[econometrics]] literature did not support either an optimistic interpretation of the EKC hypothesis - i.e., that the problem of emissions growth will solve itself - or a pessimistic interpretation - i.e., that economic growth is irrevocably linked to emissions growth. Instead, it was suggested that there was some degree of flexibility between economic growth and emissions growth.

==Policies that impact emissions==

===Price signals and subsidies===
{{See also|Carbon pricing|Carbon tax}}

In developed countries, energy costs are low and heavily [[subsidy|subsidized]], whereas in developing countries, the poor pay high costs for low-quality services. Bashmakov ''et al.''. (2001:410) commented on the difficulty of measuring energy subsidies, but found some evidence that coal production subsidies had declined in several [[developing country|developing]] and [[OECD]] countries.

===Structural market reforms===
{{See also|Emissions trading}}

Market-orientated reforms, as undertaken by several countries in the 1990s, can have important effects on energy use, [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and therefore GHG emissions. In a literature assessment, Bashmakov ''et al.''. (2001:409) gave the example of [[China]], which has made structural reforms with the aim of increasing GDP.&lt;ref name=bashmakov&gt;{{cite book

===Liberalization of energy markets===

[[free trade|Liberalization]] and restructuring of [[energy market]]s has occurred in several countries and regions, including [[Africa]], the [[European Union|EU]], [[Latin America]], and the [[US]]. These policies have mainly been designed to increase competition in the market, but they can have a significant impact on emissions. Bashmakov ''et al.''. (2001:410) concluded that structural reform of the energy sector could not guarantee a shift towards less carbon-intensive power generation. Reform could, however, allow the market to be more responsive to [[price signal]]s placed on emissions.

==Climate and other environmental policies==

===National===

*'''Regulatory standards''': These set technology or performance standards, and can be effective in addressing the [[market failure]] of informational barriers (Bashmakov ''et al.'', 2001:412).&lt;ref name=bashmakov /&gt; If the costs of [[regulation]] are less than the benefits of addressing the market failure, standards can result in net benefits.
*'''Emission taxes and charges''': an emissions tax requires domestic emitters to pay a fixed fee or tax for every tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq GHG emissions released into the atmosphere (Bashmakov ''et al.'', 2001:413). If every emitter were to face the same level of tax, the lowest cost way of achieving emission reductions in the economy would be undertaken first. In the real world, however, markets are not perfect, meaning that an emissions tax may deviate from this ideal. Distributional and [[equity (economics)|equity]] considerations usually result in differential tax rates for different sources.
*'''Tradable permits''': Emissions can be limited with a [[emissions trading|permit system]] (Bashmakov ''et al.'', 2001:415). A number of permits are distributed equal to the emission limit, with each liable entity required to hold the number of permits equal to its actual emissions. A tradable permit system can be cost-effective so long as transaction costs are not excessive, and there are no significant imperfections in the permit market and markets relating to emitting activities.
*'''Voluntary agreements''': These are agreements between government and industry (Bashmakov ''et al.'', 2001:417). Agreements may relate to general issues, such as [[research and development]], but in other cases, quantitative targets may be agreed upon. An advantage of voluntary agreements are their low transaction costs. There is, however, the risk that participants in the agreement will free ride, either by not complying with the agreement or by benefitting from the agreement while bearing no cost.
*'''Informational instruments''': According to Bashmakov ''et al.''. (2001:419), poor information is recognized as a barrier to improved energy efficiency or reduced emissions. Examples of policies in this area include increasing public awareness of climate change, e.g., through [[advertising]], and the funding of climate change research.
*'''Environmental subsidies''': A subsidy for GHG emissions reductions pays entities a specific amount per tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq for every tonne of GHG reduced or sequestered (Bashmakov ''et al.'', 2001:421). Although subsidies are generally less efficient than taxes, distributional and [[competitiveness]] issues sometimes result in energy/emission taxes being coupled with subsidies or tax exceptions.
*'''Research and development policies''': Government funding of research and development (R&amp;D) on energy has historically favoured [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] and [[coal]] technologies. Bashmakov ''et al.''. (2001:421) found that although research into renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies had increased, it was still a relatively small proportion of R&amp;D budgets in the OECD.
*'''Green power''': The policy ensures that part of the electricity supply comes from designated renewable sources (Bashmakov ''et al.'', 2001:422). The cost of [[tax|compliance]] is borne by all consumers.
*'''Demand-side management''': This aims to reduce energy demand, e.g., through energy audits, labelling, and regulation (Bashmakov ''et al.'', 2001:422).

According to Bashmakov ''et al.''. (2001:422), the most effective and economically efficient approach of achieving lower emissions in the energy sector is to apply a combination of market-based instruments (taxes, permits), standards, and information policies.

===International===

====Kyoto Protocol====

The [[Kyoto Protocol]] is an international [[treaty]] designed to reduce emissions of GHGs.&lt;ref name="unfccc kyoto protocol overview"&gt;
{{citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Kyoto treaty was agreed in 1997,&lt;ref name="unfccc kyoto protocol overview"/&gt; and is a protocol to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), which had previously been agreed in 1992. The Kyoto Protocol sets legally-blinding emissions limitations for developed countries ("Annex I Parties") out to 2008-2012.&lt;ref name="unfccc kyoto protocol overview"/&gt; The [[US]] has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and its target is therefore non-binding.&lt;ref name="pbl kyoto"/&gt; [[Canada]] has ratified the treaty, but withdrew in 2011.&lt;ref name="kyoto Canada withdrawal"&gt;''StarTribune'' - [http://www.startribune.com/world/135469408.html Canada formally pulls out of Kyoto Protocol on climate change] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321002817/http://www.startribune.com/world/135469408.html |date=21 March 2015 }} Retrieved 4 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kyoto treaty is a "cap-and-trade" system of [[emissions trading]], which includes emissions reductions in developing countries ("non-Annex I Parties") through the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM).&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=153}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The economics of the Kyoto Protocol is discussed in [[Views on the Kyoto Protocol]] and [[Flexible mechanisms#Views on the flexibility mechanisms]]. Cost estimates for the treaty are summarized at [[Kyoto Protocol#Cost estimates]]. Economic analysis of the CDM is available at [[Clean Development Mechanism]].

To summarize, the caps agreed to in Kyoto's first commitment period (2008-2012) have turned out to be too weak.&lt;ref name="carbon trust kyoto iet"&gt;
{{harvnb|Carbon Trust|2009|pp=24–25}}
&lt;/ref&gt; There are a large surplus of emissions allowances in the former-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] economies ("Economies-in-Transition" - EITs), while several other [[OECD]] countries have a deficit, and are not on course to meet their Kyoto targets (see [[Kyoto Protocol#Annex I Parties with targets]]).&lt;ref name="pbl kyoto"&gt;
{{harvnb|Olivier|Janssens-Maenhout|Peters|Wilson|2011|p=25}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carbon trust kyoto iet"/&gt; Because of the large surplus of allowances, full trading of Kyoto allowances would likely depress the price of the permits near to zero.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=164}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the surplus allowances have been bought from the EITs,&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|World Bank|2011|p=53}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but overall little trading has taken place.&lt;ref name="carbon trust kyoto iet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="world bank carbon market"&gt;Figure 1 and Table 1 {{harv|World Bank|2011|p=9}}, which show the [[EU ETS]] as taking up the largest share of the carbon market's value.

&lt;/ref&gt; Countries have mainly concentrated on meeting their targets domestically, and through the use of the CDM.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|World Bank|2011|pp=21–30}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries have implemented domestic energy/carbon taxes (see [[carbon tax]] for details) and emissions trading schemes (ETSs). The individual articles on the various ETSs contain commentaries on these schemes - see [[Kyoto Protocol#International Emissions Trading]] for a list.

A number of analysts have focussed on the need to establish a global price on carbon in order to reduce emissions cost-effectively.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., see: {{citation

&lt;/ref&gt; As stated earlier, the US is not part of the Kyoto treaty, and is a major contributor to global annual emissions of carbon dioxide&lt;ref&gt;
Figure 3.2: {{harvnb|Olivier|Janssens-Maenhout|Peters|Wilson|2011|p=13}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[greenhouse gas#Regional and national attribution of emissions]]). Additionally, the treaty does not place caps on emissions in developing countries.&lt;ref name="stern kyoto"/&gt; The lack of caps for developing countries was based on [[equity (economics)|equity]] (fairness) considerations (see [[Kyoto Protocol#Negotiations]] for more information).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Developing countries, however, have undertaken a range of policies to reduce their emissions domestically.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., see {{harvnb|World Bank|2011|pp=33–38}}

&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that current policies (as of 2011) are not strong enough to meet this target.

====Other policies====

*'''Regulatory instruments''': This could involve the setting of regulatory standards for various products and processes for countries to adopt. The other option is to set national emission limits. The second option leads to inefficiency because the marginal costs of abatement differs between countries (Bashmakov ''et al.''., 2001:430).&lt;ref name=bashmakov /&gt;
Initiatives such as the EU "cap and trade" system have also been implemented. &lt;ref&gt;European Commission,2017 &lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Carbon taxes''': This would offer a potentially cost-effective means of reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Compared with emissions trading, international or harmonized (where each country keeps the revenue it collects) taxes provide greater certainty about the likely costs of emission reductions. This is also true of a hybrid policy (see the article ''[[carbon tax]]'') (Bashmakov ''et al.''., 2001:430).

====Efficiency of international agreements====

For the purposes of analysis, it is possible to separate efficiency from equity (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;30).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; It has been suggested that because of the low energy efficiency in many developing countries, efforts should first be made in those countries to reduce emissions. Goldemberg ''et al.'' (1996, p.&amp;nbsp;34) suggested a number of policies to improve efficiency, including:
*'''Property rights reform'''. For example, [[deforestation]] could be reduced through reform of property rights.
*'''Administrative reforms'''. For example, in many countries, [[electricity]] is priced at the cost of production. Economists, however, recommend that electricity, like any other good, should be priced at the competitive price.
*'''Regulating non-greenhouse externalities'''. There are externalities other than the emission of GHGs, for example, [[road congestion]] leading to [[air pollution]]. Addressing these externalities, e.g., through [[congestion pricing]] and [[energy tax]]es, could help to lower both air pollution and GHG emissions.

'''General equilibrium theory'''

One of the aspects of efficiency for an international agreement on reducing emissions is participation. In order to be efficient, mechanisms to reduce emissions still require all emitters to face the same costs of emission (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;30).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; Partial participation significantly reduces the effectiveness of policies to reduce emissions. This is because of how the global economy is connected through [[trade]].

[[General equilibrium theory]] points to a number of difficulties with partial participation (p.&amp;nbsp;31). Examples are of "leakage" ([[carbon leakage]]) of emissions from countries with regulations on GHG emissions to countries with less regulation. For example, stringent regulation in developed countries could result in polluting industries such as [[aluminium]] production moving production to developing countries. Leakage is a type of "spillover" effect of mitigation policies.

Estimates of spillover effects are uncertain (Barker ''et al.'', 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=2007

|accessdate=2010-04-05|display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have suggested that spillover might be beneficial and result in reduced emission intensities in developing countries.

'''Comprehensiveness'''

Efficiency also requires that the costs of emission reductions be minimized (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;31). This implies that all GHGs (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, methane, etc.) are considered as part of a policy to reduce emissions, and also that carbon sinks are included. Perhaps most controversially, the requirement for efficiency implies that all parts of the [[Kaya identity]] are included as part of a mitigation policy. The components of the Kaya identity are:
*CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions per unit of energy, (carbon intensity)
*energy per unit of output, (energy efficiency)
*economic output per capita,
*and human population.
Efficiency requires that the marginal costs of mitigation for each of these components is equal. In other words, from the perspective of improving the overall efficiency of a long-term mitigation strategy, population control has as much "validity" as efforts made to improve energy efficiency.

====Equity in international agreements====

Unlike efficiency, there is no consensus view of how to assess the fairness of a particular climate policy (Bashmakov ''et al.''. 2001:438-439;&lt;ref name=bashmakov /&gt; see also [[economics of global warming#Paying for an international public good]]). This does not prevent the study of how a particular policy impacts welfare. Edmonds ''et al.'' (1995) estimated that a policy of stabilizing national emissions without trading would, by 2020, shift more than 80% of the aggregate policy costs to non-OECD regions (Bashmakov ''et al.''., 2001:439). A common global carbon tax would result in an uneven burden of abatement costs across the world and would change with time. With a global tradable quota system, welfare impacts would vary according to quota allocation.

==Regional aspects==

In a literature assessment, Sathaye ''et al.''. (2001:387-389) described regional barriers to mitigation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|year=2001

|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.htm
|accessdate=2009-05-20|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Developing countries''':
**In many developing countries, importing mitigation technologies might lead to an increase in their [[external debt]] and [[balance of payments|balance-of-payments]] deficit.
**[[Technology transfer]] to these countries can be hindered by the possibility of non-enforcement of [[intellectual property]] rights. This leaves little incentive for private firms to participate. On the other hand, enforcement of property rights can lead to developing countries facing high costs associated with patents and licensing fees.
**A lack of available capital and finance is common in developing countries.. Together with the absence of regulatory standards, this barrier supports the proliferation of inefficient equipment.
*'''Economies in transition''': In the [[New Independent States]], Sathaye ''et al.'' (2007) concluded that a lack of [[liquidity]] and a weak environmental policy framework were barriers to investment in mitigation.

===Finance===

Article 4.2 of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] commits industrialized countries to "[take] the lead" in reducing emissions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=144}}

The [[International Energy Agency]] estimates that US$197 billion is required by states in the developing world above and beyond the underlying investments needed by various sectors regardless of climate considerations, this is twice the amount promised by the developed world at the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) Cancún Agreements.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Jessica Brown and Michael Jacobs 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5701&amp;title=climate-finance-private-investment-public-sector-climate-change Leveraging private investment: the role of public sector climate finance]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a new method is being developed to help ensure that funding is available for climate change mitigation.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; This involves [[Financial leverage|financial leveraging]], whereby public financing is used to encourage private investment.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

The private sector is often unwilling to finance [[Low-carbon economy|low carbon technologies]] in developing and emerging economies as the market incentives are often lacking.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; There are many perceived risks involved, in particular:&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
# General [[political risk]] associated politically instability, uncertain property rights and an unfamiliar legal framework.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
# [[Currency risk]]s are involved is financing is sought internationally and not provided in the nationally currency.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
# Regulatory and policy risk - if the public incentives provided by a state may not be actually provided, or if provided, then not for the full length of the investment.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
# Execution risk – reflecting concern that the local project developer/firm may lack the capacity and/or experience to execute the project efficiently.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
# Technology risk as new technologies involved in low carbon technology may not work as well as expected.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
# Unfamiliarity risks occur when investors have never undertaken such projects before.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Funds from the developed world can help mitigate these risks and thus leverage much larger private funds, the current aim to create $3 of private investment for every $1 of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|4}} Public funds can be used to minimise the risks in the following way.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
* Loan guarantees provided by international public financial institutions can be useful to reduce the risk to private lenders.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
* Policy insurance can insurance the investor against changes or disruption to government policies designed to encourage low carbon technology, such as a [[feed-in tariff]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
* Foreign exchange liquidity facilities can help reduce the risks associated with borrowing money in a different currency by creating a line of credit that can be drawn on when the project needs money as a result of local currency devaluation but then repaid when the project has a financial surplus.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
* Pledge fund can help projects are too small for equity investors to consider or unable to access sufficient equity. In this model, public finance sponsors provide a small amount of equity to anchor and encourage much larger pledges from private investors, such as sovereign wealth funds, large private equity firms and pension funds. Private equity investors will tend to be risk-adverse and focused primarily on long-term profitability, thus all projects would need to meet the fiduciary requirements of the investors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
* Subordinated equity fund - an alternative use of public finance is through the provision of subordinated equity, meaning that the repayment on the equity is of lower priority than the repayment of other equity investors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; The subordinated equity would aim to leverage other equity investors by ensuring that the latter have first claim on the distribution of profit, thereby increasing their risk-adjusted returns.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; The fund would have claim on profits only after rewards to other equity investors were distributed.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

==Assessing costs and benefits==

===GDP===

The costs of mitigation and adaptation policies can be measured as a change in GDP. A problem with this method of assessing costs is that GDP is an imperfect measure of welfare (Markandya ''et al.''., 2001:478):&lt;ref name=markandya /&gt;
*Not all welfare is included in GDP, e.g., housework and leisure activities.
*There are [[externality|externalities]] in the economy which mean that some prices might not be truly reflective of their [[social cost]]s.
Corrections can be made to GDP estimates to allow for these problems, but they are difficult to calculate. In response to this problem, some have suggested using other methods to assess policy. For example, the [[Earth Summit#Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD)|United Nations Commission for Sustainable Development]] has developed a system for [[green gross domestic product|"Green" GDP]] accounting and a list of sustainable development indicators.

===Baselines===

{{See also|Climate change scenario#Baseline scenarios}}

The emissions baseline is, by definition, the emissions that would occur in the absence of policy intervention. Definition of the baseline scenario is critical in the assessment of mitigation costs (Markandya ''et al.''., 2001:469-470).&lt;ref name=markandya /&gt; This because the baseline determines the potential for emissions reductions, and the costs of implementing emission reduction policies.

There are several concepts used in the literature over baselines, including the "efficient" and "business-as-usual" (BAU) baseline cases. In the efficient baseline, it is assumed that all resources are being employed efficiently. In the BAU case, it is assumed that future development trends follow those of the past, and no changes in policies will take place. The BAU baseline is often associated with high GHG emissions, and may reflect the continuation of current energy-subsidy policies, or other market failures.

Some high emission BAU baselines imply relatively low net mitigation costs per unit of emissions. If the BAU scenario projects a large growth in emissions, total mitigation costs can be relatively high. Conversely, in an efficient baseline, mitigation costs per unit of emissions can be relatively high, but total mitigation costs low.

===Ancillary impacts===

These are the secondary or side effects of mitigation policies, and including them in studies can result in higher or lower mitigation cost estimates (Markandya ''et al.''., 2001:455).&lt;ref name=markandya /&gt; Reduced mortality and morbidity costs are potentially a major ancillary benefit of mitigation. This benefit is associated with reduced use of fossil fuels, thereby resulting in less air pollution (Barker ''et al.''., 2001:564).&lt;ref name=barker /&gt; There may also be ancillary costs. In developing countries, for example, if policy changes resulted in a relative increase in electricity prices, this could result in more pollution (Markandya ''et al.''., 2001:462).

===Flexibility===

Flexibility is the ability to reduce emissions at the lowest cost. The greater the flexibility that governments allow in their regulatory framework to reduce emissions, the lower the potential costs are for achieving emissions reductions (Markandya ''et al.''., 2001:455).&lt;ref name=markandya /&gt;
*"Where" flexibility allows costs to be reduced by allowing emissions to be cut at locations where it is most efficient to do so. For example, the Flexibility Mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol allow "where" flexibility (Toth ''et al.'', 2001:660).&lt;ref name=toth /&gt;
*"When" flexibility potentially lowers costs by allowing reductions to be made at a time when it is most efficient to do so.
Including carbon sinks in a policy framework is another source of flexibility. Tree planting and forestry management actions can increase the capacity of sinks. [[Soil]]s and other types of vegetation are also potential sinks. There is, however, uncertainty over how net emissions are affected by activities in this area (Markandya ''et al.''., 2001:476).

===No regrets options===

These are, by definition, emission reduction options that have net negative costs (Markandya ''et al.''., 2001:474-475).&lt;ref name=markandya /&gt; The presumption of no regret options affects emission reduction cost estimates (p.&amp;nbsp;455).

By convention, estimates of emission reduction costs do not include the benefits of avoided climate change damages. It can be argued that the existence of no regret options implies that there are market and [[non-market failure]]s, e.g., lack of information, and that these failures can be corrected without incurring costs larger than the benefits gained. In most cases, studies of the no regret concept have not included all the external and implementation costs of a given policy.

Different studies make different assumptions about how far the economy is from the production frontier (defined as the maximum outputs attainable with the optimal use of available inputs – natural resources, labour, etc. (IPCC, 2007c:819)).&lt;ref name=glossary&gt;{{cite web

Where the costs of implementing policies are less than the benefits, a no regret option (negative cost) is identified. "Top-down" approaches, based on [[macroeconomics]], assume that the economy is efficient in the baseline case, with the result that mitigation policies always have a positive cost.

===Technology===

Assumptions about technological development and efficiency in the baseline and mitigation scenarios have a major impact on mitigation costs, in particular in bottom-up studies (Markandya ''et al.''., 2001:473).&lt;ref name=markandya /&gt; The magnitude of potential technological efficiency improvements depends on assumptions about future technological [[innovation]] and [[market penetration]] rates for these technologies.

===Discount rates===

Assessing climate change impacts and mitigation policies involves a comparison of economic flows that occur in different points in time. The discount rate is used by economists to compare economic effects occurring at different times. Discounting converts future economic impacts into their present-day value. The discount rate is generally positive because resources invested today can, on average, be transformed into more resources later. If climate change mitigation is viewed as an [[investment]], then the return on investment can be used to decide how much should be spent on mitigation.

[[Integrated assessment modelling|Integrated assessment models (IAM)]] are used for to estimate the [[Carbon tax#Social_cost_of_carbon|social cost of carbon]].  The discount rate is one of the factors used in these models.  The IAM frequently used is the [[DICE model|Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model]] developed by [[William Nordhaus]].  The DICE model uses discount rates, uncertainty, and risks to make benefit and cost estimations of climate policies and adapt to the current economic behavior.  &lt;ref&gt;John Weyant. (2017) [https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/reep/11/1/10.1093_reep_rew018/7/rew018.pdf?Expires=1494110549&amp;Signature=Lv3DqKLajltHUzGI~F1fYQIemZvLeq1xPb0EHJGpb5KbN-BFGp0impzD~p2OcgDoqekaOkvsCvaPYxcuOK9xQS3hb4Vi3IL0UqMUgwYW2~c3MHClTJLwSCXhfZ8uMAfT2Afozsh8AUECa~tw9T7kg8yYpHRa6WwVf-AmxI6pNDUa0KQheVvVYi0rkUNINSPw4hvoB~djKxRren5YhkLKTA~62Jv3yKRfQaSkvgSUk4OMV2y7apcpVIZa7oA4yeoKMIo8owCz5DnI2KM4W61sxIMl3SVjRdSJCF5iT6l~0zmAyBSJmrddleGsXu~2FtS1qu9b-Z0SatFwE5eC5CxgoQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q Some Contributions of Integrated Assessment Models of Global Climate Change.] ''Review of Environmental Economics and Policy'' 11:1, 115-137&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of discount rate has a large effect on the result of any climate change cost analysis (Halsnæs ''et al.''., 2007:136).&lt;ref name=halsnaes /&gt; Using too high a discount rate will result in too little investment in mitigation, but using too low a rate will result in too much investment in mitigation.  In other words, a high discount rate implies that the present-value of a dollar is worth more than the future-value of a dollar.

Discounting can either be prescriptive or descriptive. The descriptive approach is based on what discount rates are observed in the behaviour of people making every day decisions (the private [[discounted cash flow|discount rate]]) (IPCC, 2007c:813).&lt;ref name=glossary /&gt; In the prescriptive approach, a discount rate is chosen based on what is thought to be in the best interests of future generations (the [[social discount rate]]).

The descriptive approach can be interpreted as an effort to maximize the economic resources available to future generations, allowing them to decide how to use those resources (Arrow ''et al.'', 1996b:133-134).&lt;ref name=arrow&gt;{{cite book

The DICE model incorporates a descriptive approach, in which discounting reflects actual economic conditions.  In a recent DICE model, DICE-2013R Model, the social cost of carbon is estimated based on the following alternative scenarios: (1) a baseline scenario, when climate change policies have not changed since 2010, (2) an optimal scenario, when climate change policies are optimal (fully implemented and followed), (3) when the optimal scenario does not exceed 2oC limit after 1900 data, (4) when the 2oC limit is an average and not the optimum, (5) when a near-zero (low) discount rate of 0.1% is used (as assumed in the [[Stern Review]]), (6) when a near-zero discount rate is also used but with calibrated interest rates, and (7) when a high discount rate of 3.5% is used.&lt;ref&gt;Nordhaus W (2014) [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/676035 Estimates of the social cost of carbon: Concepts and results from the DICE-2013R model and alternative approaches.] ''J Assoc Environ Resour Econ'' 1(1/2): 273–312.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Markandya ''et al.''. (2001:466), discount rates used in assessing mitigation programmes need to at least partly reflect the [[opportunity cost]]s of capital.&lt;ref name=markandya&gt;{{cite web

(2001:466) thought that a discount rate of around 4%-6% was probably justified, while in developing countries, a rate of 10%-12% was cited. The discount rates used in assessing private projects were found to be higher – with potential rates of between 10% and 25%.

When deciding how to discount future climate change impacts, value judgements are necessary (Arrow ''et al.''., 1996b:130). IPCC (2001a:9) found that there was no consensus on the use of long-term discount rates in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prescriptive approach to discounting leads to long-term discount rates of 2-3% in real terms, while the descriptive approach leads to rates of at least 4% after tax - sometimes much higher (Halsnæs ''et al.''., 2007:136).

Even today, it is difficult to agree on an appropriate discount rate.  The approach of discounting to be either prescriptive or descriptive stemmed from the views of Nordhaus and [[Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford|Stern]].  Nordhaus takes on a descriptive approach which “assumes that investments to slow climate change must compete with investments in other areas.”  While Stern takes on a prescriptive approach in which “leads to the conclusion that any positive pure rate of time preference is unethical.” &lt;ref&gt;John Weyant. (2017) [https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/reep/11/1/10.1093_reep_rew018/7/rew018.pdf?Expires=1494110549&amp;Signature=Lv3DqKLajltHUzGI~F1fYQIemZvLeq1xPb0EHJGpb5KbN-BFGp0impzD~p2OcgDoqekaOkvsCvaPYxcuOK9xQS3hb4Vi3IL0UqMUgwYW2~c3MHClTJLwSCXhfZ8uMAfT2Afozsh8AUECa~tw9T7kg8yYpHRa6WwVf-AmxI6pNDUa0KQheVvVYi0rkUNINSPw4hvoB~djKxRren5YhkLKTA~62Jv3yKRfQaSkvgSUk4OMV2y7apcpVIZa7oA4yeoKMIo8owCz5DnI2KM4W61sxIMl3SVjRdSJCF5iT6l~0zmAyBSJmrddleGsXu~2FtS1qu9b-Z0SatFwE5eC5CxgoQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q Some Contributions of Integrated Assessment Models of Global Climate Change.] ''Review of Environmental Economics and Policy'' 11:1, 115-137&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nordhaus’ view, his descriptive approach translates that the impact of climate change is slow, thus investments in climate change should be on the same level of competition with other investments.  He defines the discount rate to be the rate of return on capital investments.  The DICE model uses the estimated market return on capital as the discount rate, around an average of 4%.  He argues that a higher discount rate will make future damages look small, thus have less effort to reduce emissions today.  A lower discount rate will make future damages look larger, thus put more effort to reduce emissions today.&lt;ref&gt;Nordhaus, W. (2008) [http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/Balance_2nd_proofs.pdf A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies] ''Yale University Press'' pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

In Stern’s view, the pure rate of time preference is defined as the discount rate in a scenario where present and future generations have equal resources and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, F. (2007) [http://sei-us.org/Publications_PDF/SEI-FOE-DebatingClimateEcon-07.pdf Debating Climate Economics: The Stern Review vs. Its Critics] ''Global Development and Environment Institute''&lt;/ref&gt;  A zero pure rate of time preference in this case would indicate that all generations are treated equally.  The future generation do not have a “voice” on today’s current policies, so the present generation are morally responsible to treat the future generation in the same manner.  He suggests for a lower discount rate in which the present generation should invest in the future to reduce the risks of climate change.   

Assumptions are made to support estimating high and low discount rates. These estimates depend on future emissions, climate sensitivity relative to increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, and the seriousness of impacts over time.&lt;ref&gt;Anthoff, D., R.S.J.Tol, and G.W.Yohe (2009), 'Discounting for Climate Change', ''[http://www.economics-ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/2009-24 Economics -- the Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal]'', 3, (2009-24), pp. 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Long-term climate policies will significantly impact future generations and this is called intergenerational discounting.  Factors that make intergenerational discounting complicated include the great uncertainty of economic growth, future generations are affected by today’s policies, and private discounting will be affected due to a longer “investment horizon.”&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) December 2010, [https://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eerm.nsf/vwan/ee-0568-06.pdf/$file/ee-0568-06.pdf Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses: Discounting Future Benefits and Costs]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision analysis==

This is a quantitative type of [[decision analysis|analysis]] that is used to assess different potential decisions. Examples are [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit]] and [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] (Toth ''et al.''., 2001:609).&lt;ref name=toth /&gt; In cost-benefit analysis, both costs and benefits are assessed economically. In cost-effectiveness analysis, the benefit-side of the analysis, e.g., a specified ceiling for the atmospheric concentration of GHGs, is not based on economic assessment.

One of the benefits of decision analysis is that the analysis is reproducible. Weaknesses, however, have been citied (Arrow ''et al.''., 1996a:57):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*'''The decision maker''':
**In decision analysis, it is assumed that a single decision maker, with well-order preferences, is present throughout the analysis. In a cost-benefit analysis, the preferences of the decision maker are determined by applying the concepts of "[[willingness to pay]]" (WTP) and "[[willingness to accept]]" (WTA). These concepts are applied in an attempt to determine the aggregate value that society places on different resources (Markandya ''et al.''., 2001:459).&lt;ref name=markandya /&gt;
**In reality, there is no single decision maker. Different decision makers have different sets of values and preferences, and for this reason, decision analysis cannot yield a universally preferred solution.
*'''Utility valuation''': Many of the outcomes of climate policy decisions are difficult to value.
Arrow ''et al.''. (1996a) concluded that while decision analysis had value, it could not identify a globally optimal policy for mitigation. In determining nationally optimal mitigation policies, the problems of decision analysis were viewed as being less important.

===Cost-benefit analysis===

In an economically efficient mitigation response, the [[margin (economics)|marginal]] (or incremental) costs of mitigation would be balanced against the marginal benefits of emission reduction. "Marginal" means that the costs and benefits of preventing (abating) the emission of the last unit of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq are being compared. Units are measured in tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. The marginal benefits are the avoided damages from an additional tonne of carbon (emitted as carbon dioxide) being abated in a given emissions pathway (the [[carbon tax#Social cost of carbon|social cost of carbon]]).

A problem with this approach is that the marginal costs and benefits of mitigation are uncertain, particularly with regards to the benefits of mitigation (Munasinghe ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;159).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Damage function'''

In cost-benefit analysis, the optimal timing of mitigation depends more on the shape of the aggregate damage function than the overall damages of climate change (Fisher ''et al.''., 2007:235).&lt;ref name=fisher /&gt; If a damage function is used that shows smooth and regular damages, e.g., a cubic function, the results suggest that emission abatement should be postponed. This is because the benefits of early abatement are outweighed by the benefits of investing in other areas that accelerate economic growth. This result can change if the damage function is changed to include the possibility of catastrophic climate change impacts.

==The mitigation portfolio==

In deciding what role emissions abatement should play in a mitigation portfolio, different arguments have been made in favour of modest and stringent near-term abatement (Toth ''et al.''., 2001:658):&lt;ref name=toth/&gt;

*'''Modest abatement''':
**Modest deployment of improving technologies prevents lock-in to existing, low-productivity technology.
**Beginning with modest emission abatement avoids the premature retirement of existing [[capital stock]]s.
**Gradual emission reduction reduces induced sectoral unemployment.
**Reduces the costs of emissions abatement.
**There is little evidence of damages from relatively rapid climate change in the past.
*'''Stringent abatement''':
**[[Endogeneity (economics)|Endogenous]] (market-induced) change could accelerate development of low-cost technologies.
**Reduces the risk of being forced to make future rapid emission reductions that would require premature capital retirement.
**Welfare losses might be associated with faster rates of emission reduction. If, in the future, a low GHG stabilization target is found to be necessary, early abatement reduces the need for a rapid reduction in emissions.
**Reduces future climate change damages.
**Cutting emissions more quickly reduces the possibility of higher damages caused by faster rates of future climate change.

==Energy sector subsidies==

Large [[energy subsidies]] are present in many countries (Barker ''et al.'', 2001:567-568).&lt;ref name=barker /&gt; Currently governments subsidize [[fossil fuel]]s by $557 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg New Energy Finance (July, 2010) [http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/07/fossil-fuel-subsidies-outpace-renewables "Fossil Fuel Subsidies Outpace Renewables "] ''RenewableEnergyWorld.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[ScienceDaily]]'' (Apr. 22, 2010) [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100421133110.htm "Fossil-Fuel Subsidies Hurting Global Environment, Security, Study Finds"]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic theory indicates that the optimal policy would be to remove [[coal mining]] and burning subsidies and replace them with optimal taxes. Global studies indicate that even without introducing taxes, subsidy and trade barrier removal at a sectoral level would improve efficiency and reduce environmental damage (Barker ''et al.'', 2001:568). Removal of these subsidies would substantially reduce GHG emissions and stimulate economic growth.

The actual effects of removing fossil fuel subsidies would depend heavily on the type of subsidy removed and the availability and economics of other energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|publisher=[[International Panel on Climate Change]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the issue of [[carbon leakage]], where removal of a subsidy to an energy-intensive industry could lead to a shift in production to another country with less regulation, and thus to a net increase in global emissions.

==Cost estimates==

{{See also|Carbon pricing}}

===Global costs===

According to a literature assessment by Barker ''et al.''. (2007:622), mitigation cost estimates depend critically on the baseline (in this case, a reference scenario that the alternative scenario is compared with), the way costs are modelled, and assumptions about future government policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=2009-05-20|display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher ''et al.''. (2007) estimated macroeconomic costs in 2030 for multi-gas mitigation (reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other GHGs, such as [[methane]]) as between a 3% decrease in global GDP to a small increase, relative to baseline. This was for an emissions pathway consistent with atmospheric stabilization of GHGs between 445 and 710 ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. In 2050, the estimated costs for stabilization between 710 and 445 ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq ranged between a 1% gain to a 5.5% decrease in global GDP, relative to baseline. These cost estimates were supported by a moderate amount of evidence and much agreement in the literature (IPCC, 2007b:11,18).&lt;ref name=wg3 /&gt;

Macroeconomic cost estimates made by Fisher ''et al.''. (2007:204) were mostly based on models that assumed transparent markets, no transaction costs, and perfect implementation of cost-effective policy measures across all regions throughout the 21st century. According to Fisher ''et al.''. (2007), relaxation of some or all these assumptions would lead to an appreciable increase in cost estimates. On the other hand, IPCC (2007b:8) noted that cost estimates could be reduced by allowing for accelerated technological learning, or the possible use of carbon tax/emission permit revenues to reform national tax systems.&lt;ref name=wg3 /&gt;

In most of the assessed studies, costs rose for increasingly stringent stabilization targets. In scenarios that had high baseline emissions, mitigation costs were generally higher for comparable stabilization targets. In scenarios with low emissions baselines, mitigation costs were generally lower for comparable stabilization targets.

*Regional abatement costs are largely dependent on the assumed stabilization level and baseline scenario. The allocation of emission allowances/permits is also an important factor, but for most countries, is less important than the stabilization level (Gupta ''et al.'', 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;776–777).
*Other costs arise from changes in [[international trade]]. Fossil fuel-exporting regions are likely to be affected by losses in coal and oil exports compared to baseline, while some regions might experience increased bio-energy (energy derived from [[biomass]]) exports (Gupta ''et al.'', 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;776–777).
*Allocation schemes based on current emissions (i.e., where the most allowances/permits are given to the largest current polluters, and the fewest allowances are given to smallest current polluters) lead to welfare losses for developing countries, while allocation schemes based on a per capita convergence of emissions (i.e., where per capita emissions are equalized) lead to welfare gains for developing countries.

====Sectoral costs====

In a literature assessment, Barker ''et al.'' (2001:563-564), predicted that the [[renewable energy|renewables]] sector could potentially benefit from mitigation.&lt;ref name=barker&gt;{{Citation |year=2001 |contribution=Sectoral Costs and Ancillary Benefits of Mitigation. |title=Climate Change 2001: Mitigation.

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''Education Commission of the States''' ('''ECS''') tracks policy, translates research, provides advice and "creates opportunities for state policymakers to learn from one another"&lt;ref&gt;fsu.digital.flvc.org&lt;/ref&gt;. ECS was founded as a result of the creation of the '''Compact for Education''', an [[interstate compact]] approved by [[United States Congress|Congress]] and works with all 50 [[U.S. state]]s, three [[United States territory|territories]] ([[American Samoa]], [[Guam]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]]) and the [[District of Columbia]].

The idea of establishing a compact on education and creating an operational arm to follow up on its goals was originally proposed by [[James Bryant Conant]], [[University president|president]] of [[Harvard University]]. Between 1965 and 1967, [[John W. Gardner]], president of the [[Carnegie Corporation]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and former [[Governor of North Carolina|North Carolina Governor]] [[Terry Sanford]] took up the idea, drafted the proposed Compact, obtained the endorsement of all 50 states and got Congress' approval.

The organization opened its offices in [[Denver]] in 1967 and began administering the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP) test until the Reagan administration in 1982 made the decision to privatize the test, which is now administered by the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS). That decision threatened the very existence of the Commission, leading to the virtual closing of ECS's Information Clearinghouse, the laying off or early retirement of half of its 117-member staff and a 50% cut in the organization's budget.

Each member [[jurisdiction]] (state, territory, and the District of Columbia) has seven seats on the Commission, including the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] and six appointed members, usually including members of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] and education officials, such as the state education commissioner or head of the [[state education agency]].

==Commission chairs==
The commissioner chairman ship is held by the governor of a member jurisdiction. The term changed from one year to two years in 2002. It alternates between political parties.

'''Eupen-Malmedy''' or '''Eupen-Malmédy''' is a small, predominantly [[German language|German-speaking]] region in eastern [[Belgium]]. It consists of three [[Cantons of Belgium|administrative cantons]] around the small cities of [[Eupen]], [[Malmedy]], and [[Sankt Vith]] which encompass some {{convert|730|km2}}. Elsewhere in Belgium, the region is commonly referred to as the '''East Cantons''' ({{lang-fr|Cantons de l'Est}}, {{lang-nl|Oostkantons}}).

Eupen-Malmedy became part of Belgium in the aftermath of [[World War I]]. The region, which had formerly been part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and the [[German Empire]], was allocated to Belgium by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. It was formally annexed after a controversial referendum in 1920, becoming part of the [[Province of Liège]] in 1925. Agitation by German nationalists during the [[interwar period]] led to its re-annexation by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. It was returned to Belgium in 1945. Today, it forms a large component of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], one of Belgium's [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|three federal communities]].

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Carte Belgique 1843.jpg|thumb|An 1843 map of Belgium, with Eupen and Malmedy shown as part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]]]
Historically, the territories have little in common. The northern part around [[Eupen]] was originally part of the [[Duchy of Limburg]],{{sfn|Dewulf|2009|p=70}} a dependency of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] which was latterly part of the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. The Southern part, around [[Sankt Vith]], belonged to the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]].{{sfn|Dewulf|2009|p=70}} The small village of Manderfeld-Schönberg belonged to the [[Archbishopric of Trier]]. [[Malmedy]] and [[Waimes]], except the village of Faymonville, were part of the [[Imperial Abbey|abbatial principality]] of [[Stavelot-Malmedy]] which was an [[Imperial Estate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. By the 19th century, the majority of the territory spoke German while the city of [[Malmedy]] was split between French and German speakers.{{sfn|Dewulf|2009|p=70}}

In 1795, as the [[French Revolutionary Army]] entered the Austrian Netherlands, the area was also taken over and eventually incorporated in its entirety into the French department of the [[Ourthe (department)|Ourthe]].

===Prussian administration, 1815–1919===
At the [[Congress of Vienna]], the whole area was awarded to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].{{sfn|Dewulf|2009|p=70}} In the northwest of the area, [[Moresnet]], coveted by both the [[Netherlands]] and Prussia for its [[Calamine (mineral)|calamine]], was declared a neutral territory. After 1830, the 50 percent guardianship of the Netherlands was taken over by newly independent Belgium, and this remained so even after 1839, when Belgium relinquished its claims to neighbouring [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]].
[[File:Gaststätte Harmonie, Eupen.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Eupen]] in 1900 when the territory was under German rule]]
This change did not significantly affect the inhabitants of this region.  Even in the mainly French or Walloon speaking Malmedy, changes went smoothly since the municipality was allowed to continue to use French for its administration until the ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' when the authorities forbade the use of French.

For instance, during a visit to the city in 1856, the King [[Frederick William IV]] is believed to have said "I am proud to have in my kingdom a little country where people speak French". For the people of Malmedy, this would eventually change when German was implemented as the only official administrative language. This was no problem in Eupen and St.Vith but more so in Malmedy-Waimes. There was some resistance to the interdiction: for instance, Roman Catholic priests who were forbidden to preach in French started to preach in Walloon in order to avoid having to preach in German.

Most of the territory had spoken German or German dialects for centuries, with Walloon being spoken by about two-thirds of the population in the district of Malmedy at the time it was newly created in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Hans-Henning and Kunze, Peter: Nationale Minderheiten und staatliche Minderheitenpolitik in Deutschland im 19. Jahrhundert. Akademie Verlag GmbH, Berlin, 1999 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelmingly German-speaking district of Sankt Vith further south was, in 1821, united with the district of Malmedy to form a new, much larger district of Malmedy that then had a majority of German-speakers. According to the 1 December 1900 population census this new district of Malmedy had only a minority of 28.7% Walloon-speaking inhabitants. The smaller but more populous district of Eupen was almost entirely German-speaking, with Walloon and French speaking minorities making up less than 5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.geschichte-on-demand.de/fremdspr_krei.html Foreign-language minorities in the German Reich according to the population census of 1 December 1900 (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of [[World War I]], most of the inhabitants of the Eupen and Malmedy districts considered themselves German and fought for the German Empire during the war.

===Provisional Belgian administration, 1919–25===
[[File:Duitsland1914-1923.png|thumb|Map showing the territories lost by the [[German Empire]] after [[World War I]]. Eupen-Malmedy is labelled "8" on the map.]]
During [[World War I]], Belgium [[German invasion of Belgium|was invaded]] by the German Empire and, between 1914 and 1918, much of Belgium's territory was [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|under German military occupation]]. With the defeat of Germany in 1918, Belgian politicians attempted to expand Belgian territory at German expense. However, the settlement at the [[Treaty of Versailles]] proved disappointing for Belgium.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=12}} Belgium failed to gain any territory from the Netherlands or Luxembourg, but was awarded the small German colonial territory of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] in Africa and Eupen-Malmedy in Europe, together with the previously neutral territory of Moresnet.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=12}} At the time, Eupen-Malmedy had approximately 64,000 residents.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=12}} Although the Belgian government attempted to depict Eupen-Malmedy as an ethnically Belgian territory, many Belgians were suspicious of the move.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=12}}

In 1919, a Transitional Government was established for Eupen-Malmedy by the Belgian government. It was headed by a Belgian general, [[Herman Baltia]].{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=13}} Under the terms of the Treaty, Belgian control over the territory was contingent on the result of a local [[plebiscite]], held between January and June 1920. The plebiscite itself was held without a [[secret ballot]], and organized as a consultation in which all citizens who opposed the annexation had to formally register their protest; just 271 of nearly 34,000 eligible voters did so.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=15}}{{sfn|Dewulf|2009|p=71}} The [[League of Nations]] accepted the result and the Transitional Government prepared for the unification of Eupen-Malmedy with Belgium in June 1925.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=15}}

===Integration into Belgium, 1925–40===
In June 1925, the Eupen-Malmedy was finally incorporated into the Belgian state as part of the [[Province of Liège]]. The inhabitants of the region voted in its first [[Belgian general election, 1925|Belgian general election in 1925]] and returned a vote in favour of the centre-right [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]].{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=15}} A local centre-right party, the ''Christliche Volkspartei'' (Christian People's Party), emerged by 1929.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=34}}

The early Belgian administration of Eupen-Malmedy was paralleled by secret negotiations between [[Belgian]] and [[Weimar Germany|Weimar German]] government of [[Gustav Stresemann]] over a possible return of the region in exchange for money.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|pp=18-23}}{{sfn|Grathwol|1975|pp=221-50}} The negotiations collapsed in 1926, following the German signature of the [[Locarno Treaties]] (1925) guaranteeing Germany's western borders and international pressure.

Various ethnic German organisations emerged in the Eupen-Malmedy region in the late 1920s, campaigning to promote German culture and the return of the territory to Germany.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|pp=33-4}} After the rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany in 1933, agitation in Eupen-Malmedy increased and many inhabitants began to wear [[swastika]] badges.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=34}} Local socialists began to distance themselves from calls to return to Germany.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=39}} In 1935, an openly pro-Nazi party emerged locally, known as the ''[[Heimattreue Front]]'', which achieved a majority in all three of the Eupen-Malmedy districts in the elections of 1936 and 1939.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|pp=40-1}}

===Annexed to Germany, 1940–45===

{{also|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}
In [[World War II]], Nazi Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]] in May 1940 and rapidly defeated and [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|occupied]] Belgium for a second time. On 18 May, Hitler announced the re-integration of Eupen-Malmedy into Germany while the rest of the country remained under [[military occupation]].{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=41}} The [[Belgian government in exile]], however, refused to recognise the German annexation and maintained that Eupen-Malmedy was part of Belgium.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=41}} Administered as part of Nazi Germany, 8,000 local men were conscripted into the German armed forces of whom 2,200 were killed on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=41}}{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=143}} Support for the German takeover eroded sharply after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. The region suffered severely during the [[Ardennes Offensive]] of 1944–45 and Sankt Vith, in particular, was nearly totally destroyed by bombing.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=143}}{{sfn|Dewulf|2009|p=72}}

===Return to Belgium, 1945–present===
[[File:63023-CLT-0063-01 Regierung der Deutschsprachigen Gemeinschaft Belgiens (2).jpg|thumb|left|The seat of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]] in [[Eupen]], created in 1984]]
After the war, the Belgian state reasserted sovereignty over the area, which caused the male inhabitants of the area who had served in the German army to lose their civil rights as "traitors to the Belgian state". After the war, the Belgian authorities opened 16,400 investigations into citizens from Eupen-Malmedy, representing around 25 percent of the region's entire population. In comparison, the figure for the rest of Belgium represented less than five percent.{{sfn|O'Connell|2013|p=43}}{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=143}}

After the war, demands to return Eupen-Malmedy to Germany faded. The first regionalist political party, the ''[[Party of German-speaking Belgians|Partei der Deutschsprachigen Belgier]]'' (Party of German-speaking Belgians, or PDB), emerged in 1971 to argue that greater autonomy to be given to Belgium's German speakers within the newly created federal state but not for regional secession.{{sfn|Dewulf|2009|p=73}} The PDB's campaign culminated in the creation of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]] in 1984 which provided cultural autonomy to Belgium's 70,000 German speakers along [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|the same lines]] as those already negotiated for Belgium's [[Flemish Community|Dutch]] and [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking communities]].{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=143}} The nine German-speaking communes of the East Cantons form part of the German-speaking Community while Malmedy and Waimes are part of the French Community. There are protected rights for the minority language in both areas.

== Languages spoken in the area ==
[[File:Faciliteitengemeente Bewegwijzering.jpg|thumb|Bilingual German and French road signs in [[Eupen]] ]]
The linguistic situation of the wider area is complex since it lies on the border between the [[Romance language|Romance]] and [[Germanic languages]] and on an [[isogloss]] dividing several German dialects. In general, over the past decades, the local dialects have lost ground to German and French.

Historically, in Aubel, Baelen, Plombières, Welkenraedt (neighbouring Belgian municipalities), [[Eupen]], [[Kelmis]] and [[Lontzen]], the local languages have been classed as [[Limburgish]], thus dialects of [[Low Franconian]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. The inhabitants of Raeren have spoken [[Ripuarian (language)|Ripuarian]] and those of the district of Sankt Vith [[Moselle Franconian]], which are dialects of [[High German]]. On the other hand, most of the people living in Malmedy and Waimes speak [[Walloon language|Walloon]] or French, with a minority of German speakers. Some of the folklore and carnival traditions there are still in the Walloon language. That is also the case for the children:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The New Year's wishes have hardly been uttered when the children start going round from house to house in order to celebrate the three kings. The individual groups sing a song at the doors and demand a “lôtire” for their efforts, in other words a small sweetmeat.  They sing in Walloon and say that the kings have sent them."&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.malmedy.be/en/Tourisme/folklore-et-carnaval/la-hayes-des-rwas.html The Feast of Epiphany]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The East Cantons as a whole should therefore not be confused with the German language region created in 1963 or with the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], which does not include the (smaller) Malmedy and Waimes areas.

== Current administration ==
At the beginning of the 1920s, the municipalities composing these territories were grouped into three districts: Eupen, Malmedy, and Sankt Vith. The administration was overhauled during the local government reforms of 1976–77, and are now administered as follows:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3382">On November 16, 2015 the beta version of the '''[http://www.europeandataportal.eu European Data Portal]''' was launched.&lt;ref name="europeandataportal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeandataportal.eu|title=Home page - European Data Portal|publisher=europeandataportal.eu|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Data Portal is an initiative of the [[European Commission]], and is part of the [[Internal market|Digital Single Market]].&lt;ref name="europa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/blog/looking-open-data-different-country-try-european-data-portal|title=Looking for Open Data from a different country? Try the European Data portal &amp;#124; Digital Agenda for Europe|publisher=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The European Data Portal was created to gather [[Directive on the re-use of public sector information|Public Sector Information]] of the 28 [[Member state of the European Union|European Member States]] and the four [[EFTA]] countries.&lt;ref name="europa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/opengov/news/ec-brings-pan-european-open-data-together-european-data-portal|title=EC brings pan-European open data together on European Data Portal &amp;#124; Joinup|publisher=joinup.ec.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries are also referred to as the EU28+.

Public Sector Information that can be freely re-use for any purpose is commonly referred to as [[Open Data]]. The EU28+ countries publish public data on national data portals and geospatial portals. In order to provide one single access point to all of this data, the European Data Portal was created. On the portal, only metadata (data about the data) is shown. This metadata is directly harvested from the existing portals through the use of [[API]]s.

The data is gathered in order to promote the re-use of the public data. By re-using this data, several benefits can be achieved.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/odine-partner-zone/2015/nov/18/european-data-portal-european-data-forum|title=EU fosters open data economy with pan-European portal &amp;#124; ODINE partner zone &amp;#124; The Guardian|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These benefits are further detailed in the report [http://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/content/creating-value-through-open-data Creating Value through Open Data].

== Content ==
The European Data Portal provides access to the data sets in different ways, via:&lt;ref name="europeandataportal2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/content/data-tools|title=Data Tools - European Data Portal|publisher=europeandataportal.eu|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Direct search;
* Data catalogues; and
* [[SPARQL]] queries.

However, the European Data Portal is not just a repository for public data. The Portal offers different content:&lt;ref name="ukauthority"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukauthority.com/news/5777/eu-launches-european-data-portal|title=EU launches European Data Portal|publisher=ukauthority.com|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has highlighted differences among founder and non-founder CEOs that influence [[Return on investment|firm performance]]. These differences include: [[Return on investment|stock performance]], [[Equity stake|equity stake in the firm]], managerial incentives, [[Research and development|innovation investment]], and outlook towards [[mergers and acquisitions]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

According to some scholars such as Rudiger Fahlenbrach, founder CEOs outperform their non-founder CEO counterparts in both [[Return on investment|stock performance]] and [[Market value|market valuation]]. They tend to take a long-term view and consider their firm their lifetime achievement, resulting in them holding a larger [[equity stake]] in their firm than non-founder CEOs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Darius Palia, S. Abraham Ravid, and Chia-Jane Wang developed this idea further and concluded that founder CEOs become less influenced by managerial incentives as they continue to devote resources to their firm whereas the opposite is true for non-founder CEOs. Non-founder CEOs are less invested in their company and are more likely to tailor their performance according to managerial incentives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Scholars such as Joon Mahn Mahn Lee, Jongsoo Jays Kim, and Joonhyung Bae, concluded that founder CEOs continually invest in new projects and explore new knowledge that will benefit the firm in the long-term, suggesting that the existence of a founder CEO is correlated with a greater [[Research and development|innovation investment]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In terms of [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers &amp; acquisitions]], Fahlenbrach, along with other scholars, concluded that founder CEOs partake in a greater number of acquisitions within their [[core business]] line each year as they have a greater [[Risk Tolerance|tolerance for risk]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This additional risk taken on by founder CEOs stems from [[overconfidence]] at the CEO level which some scholars have measured through their tone in tweets, regarding both [[Earnings call|earnings announcements]] and personal statements, and their [[Option (finance)|option exercise behavior]] relative to non-founder CEOs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Founder [[CEO succession]] can occur through both voluntary and involuntary means. Noam Wasserman found in majority of founder CEO successions, the founder is forced to step down by investors. Founder CEOs who successfully execute [[New product development|product development]] or enter into negotiations with potential outside investors for additional capital have a higher likelihood of being replaced than those who are not as successful with product development and/or do not to raise additional capital. Indicated by several scholars, like Wasserman, as the CEO becomes successful in product development the needs of the firm expand and a mismatch between the current skills of the founder CEO and the new skills needed for the firm's success going forward is likely to occur, increasing the probability of succession.  Founder CEOs are generally succeeded by someone from outside the firm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Founder CEO comebacks have occurred when the founder CEO was replaced and later returned to their role as CEO.

== Founder imprinting  ==

A person or several people can be founders of the firm. The founders earn the founder title once the firm becomes [[Operational definition|operational]] at which point their founder role ends. Founders do not have a particular role post founding, but their influence continues as they designed the firm's blueprint impacting structures and decision-making going forward.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== US firms ==
Eleven percent of US [[Market capitalization|large cap firms]] are led by founder CEOs, including well-known companies such as [[Facebook]], [[Netflix]],  [[FedEx|Fedex]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Negative and positive contributions to firm performance  ==
Several differences identified in research exist between firms led by founder CEOs and non-founder CEOs. Identified differences include [[Return on investment|stock performance]], [[equity stake]], managerial incentives, [[Research and development|innovation investment]] and participation in [[mergers and acquisitions]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In November 2009, [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune Magazine]] named [[Steve Jobs]], founder of [[Apple Inc.]], CEO of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2009/11/23/decade-steve-jobs-apple/|title=The Decade of Steve Jobs (Fortune, 2009)|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six runners-up, all founder CEOs, were: [[Bill Gates]], [[Warren Buffett]], [[Martha Stewart]], [[Bernard Madoff]], [[Sergey Brin]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2009/11/05/fortune-magazine-names-apples-steve-jobs-ceo-of-the-decade/|title=Fortune magazine names Apple’s Steve Jobs CEO of the decade|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stock performance  ===
According to some scholars such as Rudiger Fahlenbrach, firms led by founder CEOs outperform those led by non-founder CEOs, in both [[Return on investment|stock performance]] and [[Market value|market valuation]].  Between the time period of 1993 and 2002 an [[Portfolio (finance)|equally weighted portfolio]], consisting of companies led by founder CEOs, would have earned an annual benchmark-adjusted return of 8.3%. In other words, an [[Abnormal return|excess abnormal return]] of 4.4% annually.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahlenbrach|first=Rüdiger|date=2009-01-01|title=Founder-CEOs, Investment Decisions, and Stock Market Performance|jstor=40505931|journal=The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|volume=44|issue=2|pages=439–466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2016, 16 companies in the [[S&amp;P 500 Index|S&amp;P 500]] still have founder CEOs, who have been with the company for at least 5 years. In aggregate, these companies have generated a 5-year average [[Rate of return|return]] of 170%, significantly greater than the 56% 5-year S&amp;P 500 gain.  Of these companies, 14 have outperformed the market over the past three years. These companies include: [[Facebook]], [[Netflix]], [[Under Armour]], [[Nvidia]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Starbucks]], [[Regeneron|Regeneron Pharmaceuticals]], [[L Brands]], [[Verisign|VeriSign]], [[FedEx]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[Akamai Technologies]], [[Intercontinental Exchange]], and [[SanDisk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2016/03/28/19-companies-excel-founders-charge/82343660/|title=Founders make great CEOs. Here's why|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity stake  ===
Fahlenbrach, like many other scholars, concluded that founder CEOs have a larger [[equity stake]] in the firm, potentially reducing the [[Principal–agent problem|principal agent problem]].  Founder CEOs consider their firm their lifetime achievement and therefore take a long-term view. This approach results in the [[Shareholder value|optimal shareholder-value maximizing strategy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Managerial incentives  ===
Incentive structures do differ for firms led by founder CEOs and non-founder CEOs as a result of different pay performance sensitivity as concluded by several scholars including Palia, Ravid, and Wang. A statistically significant relationship is present between these two variables for firms led by non-founder CEOs. Non-founder CEOs tend to be less invested in their company and are more likely to tailor their performances according to their pay incentives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Meanwhile, this relationship is insignificant for founder CEOs, who become less influenced to pay incentives as they devote more time and energy to their firm.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palia|first=Darius|last2=Ravid|first2=S. Abraham|last3=Wang|first3=Chia-Jane|date=2008-02-01|title=Founders versus non-founders in large companies: financial incentives and the call for regulation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11149-007-9042-z|journal=Journal of Regulatory Economics|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=55–86|doi=10.1007/s11149-007-9042-z|issn=0922-680X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This founder CEO attachment to their firm results in lower salaries, which can be seen in a study completed by Noam Wasserman on 528 ventures between the years 1996 and 2002. This results of this study concluded that more than half, 51%, of founder CEOs make either the same salary or one that is lower than someone who reports to them. Additionally, the results showed that founder CEOs receive 20% less in cash compensation than their non-founder CEO counterparts with similar experience.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-founders-dilemma|title=The Founder’s Dilemma|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovation investment ===
Scholars have indicated that founder CEOs experience greater [[innovation]] performance than non-founder CEOs, who tend to be [[Risk-averse|risk averse]]. Extant research attributes these differences in [[Research and development|innovation investment]]  to founder CEOs taking a long-term approach, continually investing in new projects, and exploring new knowledge. Thus suggesting that founder CEOs are not as concerned with [[job security]] or impacted by short term performance, therefore, resources are dedicated to long-term resources. Lee, Kim, and Bae found that the existence of a founder CEO is [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] with a 31 percent increase in the citation-weighted [[patent]] count before controlling for [[Research and development|research and development spending]] and a 23 percent increase after controlling for [[Research and development|research and development spending]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joon Mahn Mahn|last2=Kim|first2=Jongsoo Jays|last3=Bae|first3=Joonhyung|date=2016-01-01|title=Are Founder CEOs Better Innovators? Evidence from S&amp;P 500 Firms|url=http://proceedings.aom.org/content/2016/1/13311|journal=Academy of Management Proceedings|language=en|volume=2016|issue=1|page=13311|doi=10.5465/AMBPP.2016.13311abstract|issn=0065-0668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mergers and acquisitions  ===
Fahlenbrach, along with others concluded founder-CEOs have a greater [[Risk Tolerance|risk tolerance]] and partake in a greater number of [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] per year than non-founder CEOs.  The [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] that founder-CEOs make do not diversify their portfolio as the acquisitions tend to be within their [[core business]]es.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Joon Mahn Lee, Byoung-Hyoun Hwang, and Hailiang Chen suggested that the additional risks taken on by founder-led firms stem from [[overconfidence]] at the CEO level.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Founder CEO overconfidence ====
Founder-CEOs overconfidence may have negative or positive effect on their firms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Stephen X.|last2=Cueto|first2=Javier|date=2015-11-09|title=The Study of Bias in Entrepreneurship|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/etap.12212|journal=Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=419–454|doi=10.1111/etap.12212|issn=1042-2587}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In a study completed on the [[S&amp;P 1500|S&amp;P 1500 firms]] by Lee, Hwang, and Chen, it was concluded that founder CEOs use fewer negative words in both personal tweets and statements regarding [[Earnings call|earnings]]. This optimism was observed to exist at the executive level as well. Founder CEOs also provide more optimistic earnings estimates than their non-founder counterparts. Investors are unaware of this [[overconfidence bias]] among founder CEOs and take them at face value indicating no discount taken into consideration in the [[financial market]]s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joon Mahn|last2=Hwang|first2=Byoung-Hyoun|last3=Chen|first3=Hailiang|date=2017-03-01|title=Are founder CEOs more overconfident than professional CEOs? Evidence from S&amp;P 1500 companies|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2519/abstract|journal=Strategic Management Journal|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=751–769|doi=10.1002/smj.2519|issn=1097-0266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 study completed by researchers at Purdue University, this overconfidence was seen when 3,000 entrepreneurs, founders, claimed there was an 81% chance of success for them and only a 59% chance for peers. One in three of these entrepreneurs believed they had a 100% success rate going forward.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Additionally, [[Option (finance)|options]], which are tied to firm performance, were taken into account in Lee, Hwang, and Chen's study to measure overconfidence as most CEOs, founders or non-founders, are compensated in [[Option (finance)|options]] to an extent. When analyzing option-exercise behavior using the value of [[Vesting|vested in-the-money]] options to the total compensation, they concluded that founder CEOs had a significantly greater ratio. By comparison, they concluded that non-founder CEOs generally exercise their [[Option (finance)|options]] immediately when they become exercisable in-the-money to receive cash and remove their compensation linkage to future performance. Founder CEOs, however, hold off on exercising their in-the-money options as they are overly optimistic about the firm's future performance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Founder CEO succession  ==

=== Occurrence ===
In the three years subsequent to the firm being founded, Wasserman concluded 50% of founder CEOs step down. The following year, another 10% step down and by the time the firm has an [[initial public offering]] less than 25% of founders still hold the CEO position.  This being said, the decision to step down is not always voluntary, four out of five founder CEOs are forced to relinquish their role as CEO by investors.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Events affecting replacement likelihood ===
As indicated in Wasserman's study and others, founder CEOs experience higher turnover when they:
# Successfully execute [[New product development|product development]]. Thus, the quicker the founder CEO leads the firm to success in product development, the quicker they will be replaced. As the needs of the firm expand with product development, a mismatch is likely to occur between the current skills of the founder CEO and the new skills needed for the firm's success going forward.
# Enter negotiations with potential investors for additional capital. As [[Investor|personal investors]] (family and friends), [[angel investor]]s, and [[venture capitalists]] invest in the firm, founder CEOs must often give up some control. It is also possible that potential investors will make their investment in the firm contingent upon the appointment of a new CEO. This occurs when the investors do not trust the founder CEO's ability to lead the company longer term. The likelihood of this happening is higher when the amount of capital needed is higher and outsiders have a larger equity stake in the firm, giving them more control in these decisions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wasserman|first=Noam|date=2003-03-01|title=Founder-CEO Succession and the Paradox of Entrepreneurial Success|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.14.2.149.14995|journal=Organization Science|volume=14|issue=2|pages=149–172|doi=10.1287/orsc.14.2.149.14995|issn=1526-5455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founder CEO successor origin ===
Wasserman concluded that founder CEOs are almost always replaced by someone outside the organization (outside successor) opposed to someone inside (inside successor). Smaller and younger firms turn tend to turn to outsiders whereas in larger firms the [[board of directors]] is disinclined to appoint an outsider successor CEO unless the firm has experienced poor past performance. Relative to inside successors, outside successors are known to make more changes within the firm altering the firms overall business strategy, earn higher compensation, and achieve higher inter-organizational status.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Founder CEO comeback ===
A founder CEO comeback can be defined as a founder CEO who relinquished their role as CEO and later returns to the position. A study completed by Ryan Krause, Abhijith G. Acharya, and Jeffrey G. Covin, on fourteen high-profile [[Fortune 1000]] comeback firms, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Starbucks]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Dell]], [[Charles Schwab Corporation|Charles Schwab]], [[PeopleSoft|Peoplesoft]] and [[Google]], identified five key conditions attributable to a founder-CEO comeback. The conditions include: poor performance, unplanned succession, founder on board, founder ownership, and interdependent board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krause|first=Ryan|last2=Acharya|first2=Abhijith G.|last3=Covin|first3=Jeffrey G.|date=2014-12-01|title=Here I come to save the day: Proposing necessary and sufficient conditions for founder-CEO comeback|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352673414000055|journal=Journal of Business Venturing Insights|volume=1–2|pages=26–30|doi=10.1016/j.jbvi.2014.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Freedom of Thought Ben Franklin.jpg|thumb|200px|"Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom &amp; no such thing as publick liberty without freedom of speech", [[Benjamin Franklin]], 1722.]]

'''Freedom of thought''' (also called  '''freedom of conscience''' or '''ideas''') is the [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] of an individual to hold or consider a fact, viewpoint, or [[thought]], independent of others' viewpoints. 

== Overview ==
&lt;!-- Note: perhaps something could be mentioned here about the Four Freedoms proposed by Franklin Roosevelt, which also includes freedom from fear and freedom from want --&gt;

Freedom of thought is the precursor and progenitor of—and thus is closely linked to—other liberties, including [[freedom of religion]], freedom of speech, and freedom of expression. Though freedom of thought is axiomatic for many other freedoms they are in no way required for it to operate and exist. The conception of a freedom or a right does not guarantee its inclusion, legality, or protection via a philosophical caveat. It is a very important concept in the Western world and nearly all{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} democratic constitutions protect these freedoms. For instance, the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] contains the famous guarantee in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] that laws may not be made that interfere with religion "or prohibiting the free exercise thereof". U.S. [[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Benjamin Cardozo]] reasoned in ''[[Palko v. Connecticut]]'' (1937):

{{quote|Freedom of thought... is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom. With rare aberrations a pervasive recognition of this truth can be traced in our history, political and legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court
 |litigants=Palko v. State of Connecticut

 |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=302&amp;invol=319
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Such ideas are also a vital part of [[international human rights law]]. In the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which is legally binding on member states of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), "freedom of thought" is listed under Article 18:

{{quote|Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.}}

The [[United Nations]]' [[Human Rights Committee]] states that this, "distinguishes the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief from the freedom to manifest religion or belief. It does not permit any limitations whatsoever on the freedom of thought and conscience or on the freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief of one's choice. These freedoms are protected unconditionally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=General Comment No. 22: The right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Art. 18) : . 30/07/93. CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.4, General Comment No. 22. (General Comments)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Article 19 of the UDHR guarantees that "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference".

==History of development and suppression==
{{wikinews|Interview with dismissed Ocean Drive columnist Trisha Posner}}

It is impossible to know with certainty what another person is thinking, making suppression difficult. The concept is developed throughout the Bible, most fully in the writings of [[Paul of Tarsus]] (e.g., "For why should my freedom [''eleutheria''] be judged by another's conscience [''suneideseos'']?" [[1 Corinthians]] 10:29).&lt;ref&gt;Eugene J. Cooper, "Man's Basic Freedom and Freedom of Conscience in the Bible : Reflections on 1 Corinthians 8–10", ''Irish Theological Quarterly'' Dec 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GiordanoBrunoCampodeiFiori cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bronze statue of [[Giordano Bruno]], Campo de' Fiori, Rome]]
Although Greek philosophers [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]] had discussed Freedom of Thought minimally, the edicts of King [[Ashoka]] (3rd century BC) have been called the first decree respecting Freedom of Conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6cL9Jng5okC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=%22freedom+of+conscience%22+ashoka&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22freedom%20of%20conscience%22%20ashoka&amp;f=true|title=Luigi Luzzatti, "The First Decree on Freedom of Conscience" p. 47 in ''God in Freedom''|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In European tradition, aside from the decree of religious toleration by [[Constantine I]] at Milan in 313, the philosophers [[Themistius]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[John Locke]], [[Voltaire]], [[Alexandre Vinet]], and [[John Stuart Mill]] have been considered major proponents of the idea of Freedom of Conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Luzzatti, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Elizabeth I]] revoked a thought censorship law in the late sixteenth century, because, according to Sir [[Francis Bacon]], she did "not [like] to make windows into men's souls and secret thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brimacombe |first=Peter |title=All the Queen's Men: The World of Elizabeth I |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2000 |pages=125 |isbn=0-312-23251-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her reign, philosopher, mathematician, [[astrologer]], and astronomer [[Giordano Bruno]] took refuge in England from the [[Italian Inquisition]], where he published a number of his books regarding an infinite universe and topics banned by the Catholic Church. After leaving the safety of England, Bruno was eventually [[Execution by burning|burned]] as a [[Christian heresy|heretic]] in Rome for refusing to recant his ideas. For this reason, he is considered by some to be a martyr for free thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Giordano Bruno: Martyrs of free thought no. 1|author=Arturo Labriola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[freedom of expression]] can be limited through [[censorship]], arrests, [[book burning]], or [[propaganda]], and this tends to discourage freedom of thought. Examples of effective campaigns against freedom of expression are the Soviet suppression of genetics research in favor of a theory known as [[Lysenkoism]], the book-burning campaigns of [[Nazi Germany]], the radical [[anti-intellectualism]] enforced in [[Cambodia]] under [[Pol Pot]], the strict limits on freedom of expression imposed by the [[communist state|Communist]] governments of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and Cuba or by [[right-wing authoritarian]] dictatorships such as those of [[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Chile]] and [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Spain]].

The [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], which states that [[thought]] is inherently embedded in [[language]], would support the claim that an effort to limit the use of words of language is actually a form of restricting freedom of thought.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} This was explored in [[George Orwell]]'s novel'' [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'', with the idea of [[Newspeak]], a stripped-down form of the [[English language]] lacking the capacity for metaphor and limiting expression of original ideas.

'''Gilbert Keith Chesterton''', [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|KC*SG]] (29 May 1874&amp;nbsp;– 14 June 1936), was an English writer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Obituary | newspaper = [[Variety Obituaries|Variety]] | date = 17 June 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; poet, philosopher, dramatist, journalist, orator, [[lay theologian]], biographer, and literary and art critic.

Chesterton is well known for his fictional priest-detective [[Father Brown]],&lt;ref name="Father Brown on Chesterton,"&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Connor |first=John |url=http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/Father_Brown_on_Chesterton.pdf |format=PDF |title=Father Brown on Chesterton |publisher=Frederick Muller Ltd. |date=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for his reasoned [[apologetics]].

The world never fails to appreciate the combination when it is well done; even [[evangelicals]] sometimes give the impression of bestowing a waiver on deviations if a man is enough of a genius."}}  Chesterton routinely referred to himself as an [[Orthodoxy|"orthodox"]] Christian, and came to identify this position more and more with Catholicism, eventually converting to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] from [[Anglo-Catholicism|High Church]] [[Anglicanism]]. [[George Bernard Shaw]], his "friendly enemy", said of him, "He was a man of colossal genius."&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; Biographers have identified him as a successor to such Victorian authors as [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]], and [[John Ruskin]].{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=485}}

==Early life==
[[File:G.K. Chesterton at the age of 17.jpg|thumb|left|G. K. Chesterton at the age of 17]]

Chesterton was born in [[Campden Hill]] in [[Kensington]], London, the son of Marie Louise, née Grosjean, and Edward Chesterton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Jchesterton.htm|title=G. K. Chesterton|first=John|last=Simkin|work=Spartacus Educational}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Haushalter |first=Walter M. |year=1912 |url=https://archive.org/stream/universitymagazi11mcgiuoft#page/232/mode/2up |title=Gilbert Keith Chesterton |journal=The University Magazine |volume=XI |page=236 |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptised at the age of one month into the [[Church of England]],{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=1}} though his family themselves were irregularly practising [[Christian Unitarianism|Unitarians]].{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=13}} According to his autobiography, as a young man Chesterton became fascinated with the [[occult]] and, along with his brother [[Cecil Chesterton|Cecil]], experimented with [[Ouija boards]].{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1936 | loc = [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1301201h.html#ch15 Chapter IV]}}

Chesterton was educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]], then attended the [[Slade School of Art]] to become an illustrator.  The Slade is a department of [[University College London]], where Chesterton also took classes in literature, but did not complete a degree in either subject.

==Family life==

Chesterton married [[Frances Blogg]] in 1901; the marriage lasted the rest of his life. Chesterton credited Frances with leading him back to [[Anglicanism]], though he later considered Anglicanism to be a "pale imitation". He entered full communion with the [[Catholic Church]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=March 2007 | publisher = Google | url = http://socrates58.blogspot.com/2007/03/gk-chestertons-conversion-story.html | contribution = GK Chesterton's Conversion Story | format = [[World Wide Web]] log | title = Socrates 58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

In September 1895 Chesterton began working for the London publisher [[George Redway|Redway]], where he remained for just over a year.{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=41}} In October 1896 he moved to the publishing house [[T. Fisher Unwin]],{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=41}} where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902 the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]'' gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.

Early on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images.  Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. [[Father Brown]] is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story "The Flying Stars", Father Brown entreats the character [[Flambeau (character)|Flambeau]] to give up his life of crime: "There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it. Many a man I've known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Chesterton |first=G.

[[File:Caricature of Chesterton, by Beerbohm.jpg|thumb|[[Caricature]] of Chesterton, by [[Max Beerbohm]]]]
Chesterton loved to debate, often engaging in friendly public disputes with such men as [[George Bernard Shaw]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Do We agree? A Debate between G. K. Chesterton and Bernard Shaw, with Hilaire Belloc in the Chair |location=London |publisher=C. Palmer |year=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. G. Wells]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Clarence Darrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chesterton.org/clarence-darrow-debate/ |title=Clarence Darrow debate |publisher=American Chesterton Society |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darrow.law.umn.edu/photo.php?pid=1062 |work=Clarence Darrow digital collection |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Law School]] |title=G.K.

K. |title=Autobiography |location=London |publisher=Hutchinson &amp; Co., Ltd. |year=1936 |pages=231–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual wit===

Chesterton was a large man, standing {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} and weighing around {{convert|20|st|6|lb|kg lb}}. His girth gave rise to a famous anecdote. During the First World War a lady in London asked why he was not "out at the [[Front (military)|Front]]"; he replied, "If you go round to the side, you will see that I am."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wilson |first=A. N. |year=1984 |title=Hilaire Belloc |location=London |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion he remarked to his friend [[George Bernard Shaw]], "To look at you, anyone would think a famine had struck England."  Shaw retorted, "To look at you, anyone would think you have caused it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornelius|first=Judson K.|title=Literary Humour|publisher= St Paul's Books |location=Mumbai|isbn=81-7108-374-9|page= 144}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. G. Wodehouse]] once described a very loud crash as "a sound like G. K. Chesterton falling onto a sheet of tin".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The World of Mr. Mulliner |publisher = Barrie and Jenkins |page=172| year= 1972|author-link = P. G. Wodehouse | first = P.G. | last = Wodehouse}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesterton usually wore a cape and a crumpled hat, with a [[swordstick]] in hand, and a cigar hanging out of his mouth. He had a tendency to forget where he was supposed to be going and miss the train that was supposed to take him there. It is reported that on several occasions he sent a [[telegram]] to his wife Frances from some distant (and incorrect) location, writing such things as "Am in [[Market Harborough]]. Where ought I to be?" to which she would reply, "Home".{{Sfn | Ward | 1944 | loc = chapter XV}}  (Chesterton himself tells the story, omitting, however, his wife's alleged reply, in ch. XVI of his autobiography.)

===Radio===

In 1931, the [[BBC]] invited Chesterton to give a series of radio talks. He accepted, tentatively at first. However, from 1932 until his death, Chesterton delivered over 40 talks per year. He was allowed (and encouraged) to improvise on the scripts. This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary to sit with him during his broadcasts.{{sfn|Ker|2011}}

The talks were very popular. A BBC official remarked, after Chesterton's death, that "in another year or so, he would have become the dominating voice from Broadcasting House."&lt;ref name=catholicauthors&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicauthors.com/chesterton.html|title=Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874–1936)|work=Catholic Authors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and veneration==
[[File:PPXI.jpeg|thumb|[[Telegram]] sent by Cardinal [[Eugenio Pacelli]] (future Pius XII) on behalf of [[Pope Pius XI]] to the people of England following the death of Chesterton.]]

Chesterton died of [[congestive heart failure]] on the morning of 14 June 1936, at his home in [[Beaconsfield]], Buckinghamshire. His last known words were a greeting spoken to his wife. The [[homily]] at Chesterton's [[Requiem Mass]] in [[Westminster Cathedral]], London, was delivered by [[Ronald Knox]] on 27 June 1936. Knox said, "All of this generation has grown up under Chesterton's influence so completely that we do not even know when we are thinking Chesterton."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lauer |first=Quentin |year=1991 |title=G.K. Chesterton: Philosopher Without Portfolio |location=New York City, NY |publisher=Fordham University Press |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in [[Beaconsfield]] in the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] Cemetery. Chesterton's estate was [[probate]]d at £28,389, approximately equivalent in 2012 terms to £1.3&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Barker |first=Dudley |year=1973 |title=G. K. Chesterton: A Biography |location=New York |publisher=Stein and Day |page=287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of Chesterton's life, [[Pope Pius XI]] invested him as Knight Commander with Star of the Papal [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]] (KC*SG).&lt;ref name=catholicauthors/&gt; The Chesterton Society has proposed that he be [[beatification|beatified]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Antonio | first = Gaspari | title = 'Blessed' G.

==Writing==

[[File:G. K. Chesterton at work.jpg|thumb|left|Chesterton in his study]]
Chesterton wrote around 80 books, several hundred poems, some 200 short stories, 4000 essays, and several plays. He was a literary and social critic, historian, playwright, novelist, Catholic theologian&lt;ref&gt;Bridges, Horace J. (1914). [https://archive.org/stream/ethicaladdresses21ameruoft#page/20/mode/2up "G. K. Chesterton as Theologian."] In: ''Ethical Addresses.'' Philadelphia: The American Ethical Union, pp. 21–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caldecott, Stratford (1999). "Was G.K. Chesterton a Theologian?," ''The Chesterton Review''. (Rep. by [http://catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0499.html ''CERC: Catholic Education Research Center''].)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[apologist]], debater, and mystery writer. He was a columnist for the ''Daily News'', ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', and his own paper, ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]''; he also wrote articles for the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', including the entry on [[Charles Dickens]] and part of the entry on Humour in the 14th edition (1929). His best-known character is the priest-detective [[Father Brown]],&lt;ref name="Father Brown on Chesterton,"/&gt; who appeared only in short stories, while ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' is arguably his best-known novel. He was a convinced Christian long before he was received into the Catholic Church, and Christian themes and symbolism appear in much of his writing. In the United States, his writings on [[distributism]] were popularised through ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'', published by [[Seward Collins]] in New York.

Of his nonfiction, ''Charles Dickens: A Critical Study'' (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise. According to [[Ian Ker]] (''The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845–1961'', 2003), "In Chesterton's eyes Dickens belongs to [[Merry England|Merry]], not [[Puritan]], England"; Ker treats Chesterton's thought in Chapter 4 of that book as largely growing out of his true appreciation of Dickens, a somewhat shop-soiled property in the view of other literary opinions of the time.

Chesterton's writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humour. He employed paradox, while making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, philosophy, theology and many other topics.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, J. D. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/augustweb-only/8-27-52.0.html "G.K.

==Views and contemporaries==
[[File:Three acres and a cow.JPG|thumb|Self-portrait of Chesterton based on the [[Distributism|distributist]] slogan "[[Three acres and a cow]]"]]

Chesterton's writing has been seen by some analysts as combining two earlier strands in English literature. Dickens' approach is one of these. Another is represented by [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]], whom Chesterton knew well: satirists and social commentators following in the tradition of [[Samuel Butler (1835-1902)|Samuel Butler]], vigorously wielding paradox as a weapon against complacent acceptance of the conventional view of things.

Chesterton's style and thinking were all his own, however, and his conclusions were often opposed to those of Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. In his book ''[[Heretics (book)|Heretics]]'', Chesterton has this to say of Wilde: "The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde.  It is the carpe diem religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw."{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch7.html chapter 7]}}  More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in ''Orthodoxy'' concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: "Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde."

Chesterton and Shaw were famous friends and enjoyed their arguments and discussions.  Although rarely in agreement, they both maintained good will toward and respect for each other. However, in his writing, Chesterton expressed himself very plainly on where they differed and why. In ''Heretics'' he writes of Shaw:

{{quote |After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch4.html chapter 4]}}}}

Shaw represented the new school of thought, [[modernism]], which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' he writes: "The worship of will is the negation of will … If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up to me and says, 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular."{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch20.html chapter 20]}}

[[File:Title Page of Orthodoxy, by G.K. Chesterton.png|thumb|Title page of the 1909 edition of ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'', first published in the previous year]]
This style of argumentation is what Chesterton refers to as using 'Uncommon Sense' – that is, that the thinkers and popular philosophers of the day, though very clever, were saying things that were nonsensical. This is illustrated again in ''Orthodoxy'': "Thus when Mr. H. G. Wells says (as he did somewhere), 'All chairs are quite different', he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them 'all chairs'."{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1908b | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html chapter 3]}} Or, again from ''Orthodoxy'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless – one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is – well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html|title=The Suicide of Thought&gt;|work=dmu.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chesterton, as a political thinker, cast aspersions on both [[progressivism]] and [[conservatism]], saying, "The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Blunders of Our Parties| newspaper = Illustrated London News | date = 19 April 1924}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an early member of the [[Fabian Society]], but resigned from it at the time of the Boer War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holroyd |first1=Michael |title=Bernard Shaw Vol 2 |date=1989 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |location=London |isbn=0701133503 |page=214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another contemporary and friend from schooldays was [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|Edmund Bentley]], inventor of the [[clerihew]].  Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend's first published collection of poetry, ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), which popularised the clerihew form.  Chesterton was also godfather to Bentley's son, [[Nicolas Bentley|Nicolas]], and opened his novel ''The Man Who Was Thursday'' with a poem written to Bentley.

===Charges of anti-Semitism===

Chesterton faced accusations of [[anti-Semitism]] during his lifetime, as well as posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1455054,00.html | title = Last orders | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 9 April 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An early supporter of [[Alfred Dreyfus|Captain Dreyfus]], by 1906 he had turned into an [[Dreyfus Affair|anti-dreyfusard]].&lt;ref&gt;Chesterton, Gilbert. ''G.K. Chesterton to the Editor''. The Nation, 18 March 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 20th century, his fictional work included caricatures of Jews, stereotyping them as greedy, cowardly, disloyal and communists.&lt;ref name="Mayers85-7"/&gt;

The [[Marconi scandal]] of 1912–13 brought issues of anti-Semitism into the political mainstream, on the basis that senior ministers in the Liberal government had secretly profited from advanced knowledge of deals regarding wireless telegraphy. Some of the key players were Jewish.&lt;ref name="Frances Donaldson 2011 51"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frances Donaldson|title=The Marconi Scandal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JKMamWMSbAC&amp;pg=PT51|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Todd Edelman identifies Catholic writers as central critics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most virulent attacks in the Marconi affair were launched by [[Hilaire Belloc]] and the brothers Cecil and G. K. Chesterton, whose hostility to Jews was linked to their opposition to liberalism, their backward-looking Catholicism, and their nostalgia for a medieval Catholic Europe that they imagined was ordered, harmonious, and homogeneous.
&lt;p&gt;
The Jew baiting at the time of the Boer War and the Marconi scandal was linked to a broader protest, mounted in the main by the Radical wing of the Liberal Party, against the growing visibility of successful businessmen in national life and their challenge to what were seen as traditional English values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Todd M. Endelman|title=The Jews of Britain, 1656 to 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMOQkrUtqkwC&amp;pg=PA155|year=2002|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian Frances Donaldson says, "If Belloc's feeling against the Jews was instinctive and under some control, Chesterton's was open and vicious, and he shared with Belloc the peculiarity that the Jews were never far from his thoughts."&lt;ref name="Frances Donaldson 2011 51"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean Rapp, "The Jewish response to GK Chesterton's antisemitism, 1911–33."

In a work of 1917, titled ''A Short History of England'', Chesterton considers the royal decree of 1290 by which Edward I [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled Jews from England]], a policy that remained in place until 1655. Chesterton writes that popular perception of Jewish moneylenders could well have led Edward I's subjects to regard him as a "tender father of his people" for "breaking the rule by which the rulers had hitherto fostered their bankers' wealth". He felt that Jews, "a sensitive and highly civilized people" who "were the capitalists of the age, the men with wealth banked ready for use", might legitimately complain that "Christian kings and nobles, and even Christian popes and bishops, used for Christian purposes (such as the Crusades and the cathedrals) the money that could only be accumulated in such mountains by a usury they inconsistently denounced as unchristian; and then, when worse times came, gave up the Jew to the fury of the poor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Anthony | last = Julius | authorlink = Anthony Julius | title = [[Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2010 | page = 422}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = G. K. | last = Chesterton | title = A Short History of England | publisher = Chatto and Windus | year = 1917 | pages = 108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New Jerusalem (Chesterton book)|The New Jerusalem]]'', Chesterton made it clear that he believed that there was a "Jewish Problem" in Europe, in the sense that he believed that Jewish culture (though not Jewish ethnicity) separated itself from the nationalities of Europe.{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1920 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/New_Jerusalem.txt Chapter 12]}}{{Failed verification|date=June 2017|reason=maybe the wrong chapter?}} He argued that he was quite in favour of a Jew becoming Prime Minister or Lord Chancellor, under the condition, though, that "every Jew must be dressed like an Arab […] The point applies to any Jew, and to our own recovery of healthier relations with him. The point is that we should know where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land." He suggested the formation of a [[Jewish homeland]] as a solution, and was later invited to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] by Jewish [[Zionists]] who saw him as an ally in their cause. Later he grew out of the notion of Palestine as a Jewish homeland, and suggested somewhere in Africa instead.

Chesterton, like Belloc, openly expressed his abhorrence of [[Hitler]]'s rule almost as soon as it started.&lt;ref name = "Pearce2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pearce|first= Joseph|authorlink= Joseph Pearce| title= Literary Giants, Literary Catholics | year = 2005 | publisher = Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-58617-077-5|page= 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Rabbi Stephen Wise]] wrote in a posthumous tribute to Chesterton in 1937 : 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When Hitlerism came, he was one of the first to speak out with all the directness and frankness of a great and unabashed spirit. Blessing to his memory!{{Sfn | Ward | 1944 | loc = [https://archive.org/stream/gilbertkeithches001579mbp#page/n301/mode/2up p. 265]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Truth about the Tribes'' Chesterton blasted German race theories, writing: "the essence of Nazi Nationalism is to preserve the purity of a race in a continent where all races are impure."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XsWrlo7P-5cC&amp;lpg=PA593&amp;ots=IL3TzrzpZc&amp;dq=%22the%20essence%20of%20Nazi%20Nationalism%20is%20to%20preserve%20the%20purity%20of%20a%20race%20in%20a%20continent%20where%20all%20races%20are%20impure.%22&amp;pg=PA593#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20essence%20of%20Nazi%20Nationalism%20is%20to%20preserve%20the%20purity%20of%20a%20race%20in%20a%20continent%20where%20all%20races%20are%20impure.%22&amp;f=false ''The Collected Works of G.K. Chesterton''], Volume 5, Ignatius Press, 1987, page 593&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian Simon Mayers points out that Chesterton wrote in works such as ''The Crank'', ''The Heresy of Race'', and ''The Barbarian as Bore'' against the concept of racial superiority and critiqued pseudo-scientific race theories, saying they were akin to a new religion.&lt;ref name="Mayers85-7"/&gt; In ''The Truth About the Tribes'' Chesterton wrote, "the curse of race religion is that it makes each separate man the sacred image which he worships. His own bones are the sacred relics; his own blood is the [[Januarius#Blood|blood of St. Januarius]]."&lt;ref name="Mayers85-7"&gt;{{cite book|pages=85–87|title=Chesterton's Jews: Stereotypes and Caricatures in the Literature and Journalism of G.K. Chesterton|author=Simon Mayers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbmWBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;ots=c40rkmm2Vz&amp;dq=Chesterton%E2%80%99s%20Jews%3A%20Stereotypes%20and%20Caricatures%20in%20the%20Literature%20and%20Journalism%20of%20G.K.%20Chesterton&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayers records that despite "his hostility towards Nazi antisemitism … [it is unfortunate that he made] claims that 'Hitlerism' was a form of Judaism, and that the Jews were partly responsible for race theory."&lt;ref name="Mayers85-7"/&gt; In ''The Judaism of Hitler'' Chesterton wrote "Hitlerism is almost entirely of Jewish origin."&lt;ref name="Mayers85-7"/&gt; In ''A Queer Choice'' Chesterton maintained that the only possible source of "the Hitlerites" idea of "a Chosen Race" was "from the Jews."&lt;ref name="Mayers85-7"/&gt; In ''The Crank'' Chesterton went on to say: "If there is one outstanding quality in Hitlerism it is its Hebraism" and "the new Nordic Man has all the worst faults of the worst Jews: jealousy, greed, the mania of conspiracy, and above all, the belief in a Chosen Race."&lt;ref name="Mayers85-7"/&gt;

Mayers also shows that Chesterton didn't just portray Jews as culturally and religiously distinct, but racially as well. Chesterton wrote ''The Feud of the Foreigner'' in 1920, saying that the Jew "is a foreigner far more remote from us than is a Bavarian from a Frenchman; he is divided by the same type of division as that between us and a Chinaman or a Hindoo. He not only is not, but never was, of the same race."&lt;ref name="Mayers85-7"/&gt;

In ''The Everlasting Man'', while writing about human sacrifice, Chesterton suggested that medieval stories about Jews killing children might have resulted from a distortion of genuine cases of devil-worship. Chesterton wrote: "the Hebrew prophets were perpetually protesting against the Hebrew race relapsing into an idolatry that involved such a war upon children; and it is probable enough that this abominable apostasy from the God of Israel has occasionally appeared in Israel since, in the form of what is called ritual murder; not of course by any representative of the religion of Judaism, but by individual and irresponsible diabolists who did happen to be Jews."&lt;ref name="Mayers85-7"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Everlasting&gt;{{cite book|title=The Everlasting Man|author=G. K. Chesterton|page=117|publisher=Dover publications|year=2007|location=Mineola, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chesterton goes on in the paragraph to speak of "the enormous [devotional] popularity of the Child Martyr of the Middle Ages" and of [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln|little St. Hugh]] (figures held to have been ritual victims of Jews).&lt;ref name=Everlasting/&gt;

The [[Dale Ahlquist#Gilbert: The Magazine of the American Chesterton Society|American Chesterton Society]] has devoted a whole issue of its magazine, ''Gilbert'', to defending Chesterton against charges of antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesterton.org/was-chesterton-antisemitic/ "Was G.K. Chesterton Anti-Semitic?,"] by Dale Ahlquist.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to Eugenics===
In ''Eugenics and Other Evils'' Chesterton attacked [[eugenics]] as Britain was moving towards passage of the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913]]. Some backing the ideas of eugenics called for the government to sterilise people deemed "mentally defective"; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction. These ideas disgusted Chesterton who wrote, "It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children."&lt;ref name=Eugenics/&gt; He blasted the proposed wording for such measures as being so vague as to apply to anyone, including "Every tramp who is sulk, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs. That is the situation; and that is the point … we are already under the Eugenist State; and nothing remains to us but rebellion."&lt;ref name=Eugenics&gt;{{cite book|title=Eugenics and Other Evils|author=Gilbert Keith Chesterton|publisher=Cassell and Company, Ltd|location=London, UK|year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He derided such ideas as founded on nonsense, "as if one had a right to dragoon and enslave one's fellow citizens as a kind of chemical experiment".&lt;ref name=Eugenics/&gt;

Chesterton also mocked the idea that poverty was a result of bad breeding: "[it is a] strange new disposition to regard the poor as a race; as if they were a colony of Japs or Chinese coolies … The poor are not a race or even a type. It is senseless to talk about breeding them; for they are not a breed. They are, in cold fact, what Dickens describes: 'a dustbin of individual accidents,' of damaged dignity, and often of damaged gentility."&lt;ref name=Eugenics/&gt;

===Literary===
* Chesterton's ''[[The Everlasting Man]]'' contributed to [[C. S. Lewis]]'s conversion to Christianity.

K. Chesterton's ''The Everlasting Man''". The book was also cited in a list of 10 books that "most shaped his vocational attitude and philosophy of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Christian Century | date = 6 June 1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chesterton was a very early and outspoken critic of [[eugenics]]. ''[[s:Eugenics and other Evils|Eugenics and Other Evils]]'' represents one of the first book length oppositions to the [[Eugenics]] movement that began to gain momentum in England during the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secondspring.co.uk/articles/sparkes.htm "The Enemy of Eugenics"], by Russell Sparkes.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chesterton's 1906 biography of [[Charles Dickens]] was largely responsible for creating a popular revival for Dickens's work as well as a serious reconsideration of Dickens by scholars.{{Sfn | Ahlquist | 2006 | p = 286}}
* Chesterton's novel ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' inspired the Irish Republican leader [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] with the idea: "If you didn't seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out."&lt;ref&gt;Forester, Margery (2006). ''Michael Collins – The Lost Leader'', Gill &amp; MacMillan, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Collins's favourite work of Chesterton was ''The Napoleon of Notting Hill'', and he was "almost fanatically attached to it", according to his friend Sir William Darling who cemented their friendship in their mutual appreciation of Chesterton's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Michael Collins: A Life|author=James Mackay|page=Chapter 2|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|location=London, England|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Etienne Gilson]] praised Chesterton's Aquinas volume as follows: "I consider it as being, without possible comparison, the best book ever written on Saint Thomas … the few readers who have spent twenty or thirty years in studying St. Thomas Aquinas, and who, perhaps, have themselves published two or three volumes on the subject, cannot fail to perceive that the so-called 'wit' of Chesterton has put their scholarship to shame."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Letter to Chesterton's editor | editor-first = Josef | editor-last = Pieper | title = Guide to Thomas Aquinas| publisher = University of Notre Dame Press| year =1987 | pages = 6–7 | first = Etienne | last = Gilson}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Archbishop [[Fulton J. Sheen]], author of seventy books, identified Chesterton as the stylist who had the greatest impact on his own writing, stating in his autobiography ''Treasure in Clay'', "the greatest influence in writing was G. K. Chesterton who never used a useless word, who saw the value of a paradox, and avoided what was trite."&lt;ref&gt;Sheen, Fulton J. (2008). ''Treasure in Clay''. New York: Image Books/Doubleday, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Chesterton wrote the introduction for Sheen's book ''God and Intelligence in Modern Philosophy; A Critical Study in the Light of the Philosophy of Saint Thomas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=God and Intelligence|author=Fulton J.

''Marshall McLuhan: The Medium and the Messenger: A Biography.'' Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Neil Gaiman]] has stated that he grew up reading Chesterton in his school's library, and that ''[[The Napoleon of Notting Hill]]'' was an important influence on his own book ''[[Neverwhere]]'', which used a quote from it as an epigraph. Gaiman also based the character [[Characters of The Sandman#Fiddler's Green|Gilbert]], from the comic book ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]'', on Chesterton,&lt;ref&gt;Bender, Hy (2000). ''The Sandman Companion : A Dreamer's Guide to the Award-Winning Comic Series'' DC Comics, {{ISBN|1-56389-644-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Good Omens|novel]] he co-wrote with [[Terry Pratchett]] is dedicated to him.
* [[Argentine]] author and essayist [[Jorge Luis Borges]] cited Chesterton as a major influence on his own fiction. In an interview with [[Richard Burgin (writer)|Richard Burgin]] during the late 1960s, Borges said, "Chesterton knew how to make the most of a detective story."&lt;ref&gt;Burgin, Richard (1969). ''Conversations with Jorge Luis Borges.'' New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chesterton's fence===
'''Chesterton's fence''' is the principle that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood (compare to the [[Precautionary principle]]). The quotation is from Chesterton's 1929 book, ''The Thing: Why I am a Catholic'', in the chapter, "The Drift from Domesticity":

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'&lt;ref&gt;Chesterton, G. K. (1929).

'''George James Doundoulakis''' (October 19, 1921 – March 17, 2007) was a [[Greek American]] [[physicist]] and soldier who worked under [[British intelligence agencies|British Intelligence]] during [[World War II]] with [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agent [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]], and then served with the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] in [[Thessaly]], [[Greece]].

He is known by his twenty-six US Patents in the fields of [[radar]], [[electronics]], and [[Narrow-bandwidth television|narrowband television]]. Doundoulakis is best remembered for the idea of suspending the [[antenna feed]] of the [[Arecibo radio telescope]] by cables and towers, eventually patented by his brother [[Helias Doundoulakis]].

A decorated veteran of [[World War II]], Doundoulakis formed an underground resistance organization in Crete under the [[Special Operations Executive]]. He escaped to Egypt and joined the [[U.S. Army]] and [[Office of Strategic Services]] – the OSS. He was sent back to Greece, where he outfitted and unified a [[communist|leftist]] rebel army, and was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] from the [[United States Army]] and the [[King's Medal for Courage in the Cause of Freedom]] from Great Britain.

==Early life==
George Doundoulakis was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] to Greek-immigrant parents, Demetrios and Evanthia (née Psaroudakis) Doundoulakis. When he was four-years-old, his family immigrated to [[Crete, Greece]] to look after their blind grandmother in the village of [[Archanes]]. Nearby was the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] excavations at [[Knossos]], where British archaeologist – later, SOE agent – [[John Pendlebury]] had been the curator. By 1941, Greece had fallen to the [[Axis powers]] except [[Crete]]. On May 20, 1941, German [[paratrooper]]s invaded the island, known as the [[Battle of Crete]].

==World War II==
===[[Battle of Crete]] and the [[Cretan Resistance]]===
During the [[Battle of Crete]], Doundoulakis assisted the Greek and British army headquarters in [[Archanes]], translating communiqués from other military posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the British had been defeated, those soldiers who could not be evacuated either surrendered or went into hiding.

===Special Operations Executive – (SOE)===
"Monty" [[Christopher Montague Woodhouse|Woodhouse]] was appointed [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] chief on Crete, replacing [[John Pendlebury|Pendlebury]] who had been executed by the Germans during the battle. Woodhouse approached Doundoulakis after spotting his savoir-faire as the Greek interpreter in Archanes. He requested that Doundoulakis support the SOE in hiding and evacuating British soldiers who had been left behind on Crete, with full knowledge that his efforts were punishable by death. Undaunted, Doundoulakis formed an underground organization under the command of the SOE's "Monty" Woodhouse. This would become one of the first [[Cretan resistance]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Along with his brother [[Helias Doundoulakis]] and friends, they began scouring the island for recruits. Gathering momentum, Doundoulakis rounded up ex-military personnel and civilians from [[Heraklion]] and [[Lasithi]]. After Woodhouse left Crete, the SOE replaced him with [[Thomas Dunbabin|"Tom" Dunbabin]]. Risky sabotages under his watch were performed, such as the destruction of the [[Kastelli, Heraklion|Kastelli]] Airfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

After being relayed to Dunbabin, it resulted in the destruction of a German convoy destined to resupply Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] and his [[Afrika Korps]] in September 1942.

After serving under the SOE for two years, Doundoulakis’ ever-widening organization became apparent. He was blackmailed by a local Cretan who demanded one million drachmas as hush money. Otherwise, his organization and the SOE's Leigh Fermor would be let known to the Germans. Refusing the blackmail, Doundoulakis sent high school friends Sifis Migadis and John Androulakis to dispose of the traitor. However, they were too late in stopping the betrayal to the Gestapo. 
Leigh Fermor urged Doundoulakis to take flight at once to Crete's southern shore, and await evacuation by the SOE. They escaped through [[Mount Ida]] and the mountain ranges of [[Rethymno]] with others in his organization. After hiding in caves for a month, they were rescued by a British torpedo boat south of [[Tympaki|Tymbaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with thirteen other resistance members, they headed to [[Mersa Matruh]], Egypt. As they were about to board, Doundoulakis reunited with Leigh Fermor and partisan leader [[Georgios Petrakis|Petrakogiorgis]]. Petrakogiorgis had returned to Crete on the same vessel carrying the Doundoulakis brothers to Egypt on June 7, 1943. They would not see Leigh Fermor for another forty years. [[Patrick Leigh Fermor|Leigh Fermor]] and [[W. Stanley Moss|"Billy" Stanley Moss]] became renowned after the war in the British book and film, [[Ill Met by Moonlight (film)|''Ill Met by Moonlight'']], for their [[Kidnap of Heinrich Kreipe|abduction of German General Kreipe]] from Crete. After reaching Mersa Matruh, Doundoulakis and his brother, as well as his close circle of friends, were transported to an SOE villa in [[Heliopolis, Cairo|Heliopolis]]. They were destined for SOE saboteur training upon the entreaty of [[Patrick Leigh Fermor|Leigh Fermor]], while the other escapees went off to the exiled [[Greek Armed Forces in the Middle East|Greek Army in the Middle East]].
Before leaving Crete, Doundoulakis instructed Mikis Akoumianakis to assume command of the organization that he had begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===[[Office of Strategic Services]] – (OSS)===
Two months of training at the lavish SOE villa in Heliopolis, Cairo, came to an abrupt end when Doundoulakis learned of the [[Office of Strategic Services]], the OSS. Doundoulakis contacted the fledgling American spy service that would become a key player in the Doundoulakis brothers' future. With help from Leigh Fermor, he informed the SOE commander of his intentions to join the [[American Army]]. Much to the SOE's dismay, George and Helias ultimately departed as comrade-in-arms and with hopes of defeating their common enemy.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his discharge, Doundoulakis settled in [[Brooklyn, NY]].

===Education===
After settling in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Doundoulakis received a bachelor's degree in physics from [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|Brooklyn Polytechnic]] in 1953 under the [[GI Bill]]. He went on to earn his master's of science in physics at [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|Brooklyn Polytechnic]] under renowned physicist and X-ray crystallographer, [[Paul Peter Ewald]] in 1955.

===RCA Institutes===
After receiving his master's of physics from Brooklyn Polytechnic, Doundoulakis found his metier in electronics, radio physics and the advancing field of radar and television. Tutored by Ira Kamen, one of the preeminent electrical engineers in New York City at the [[TCI College of Technology|RCA Institutes]], Doundoulakis gained a solid foothold in the field. Subsequently, he taught electronics at the RCA Institutes. In 1956, Doundoulakis and Ira Kamen filed their first US patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===General Bronze Corporation===
Seeing the potential of this rising star in a rapidly developing field, Doundoulakis was hired by General Bronze Corporation in [[Garden City, New York]] as head of [[Research and Development]] (R&amp;D). At the time, General Bronze was dedicated to pioneering and taking the lead in the commercial market of antenna designs.

As the head of Research and Development for General Bronze, Doundoulakis was notified by [[Cornell University]] of their intent to build a [[radio telescope]]. Subsequently, he was invited to Cornell the day the project for the design and construction of the antenna at [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico]] was announced, by Professor [[William E. Gordon|William Gordon]]. Gordon, who led the project for Cornell, indicated at that time that the support for the [[antenna feed]] – or "eye" – was envisioned to be a 500-foot tower situated in the center of the 1000&amp;nbsp;ft. reflector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Doundoulakis, foreseeing a simpler approach with a suspended [[antenna feed]], leapt at the opportunity. Along with Zachary Sears – who directed Internal Design at Digital B &amp; E Corporation of New York – he received the [[request for proposal]] (RFP) from [[Cornell University]] for the antenna design. He studied the idea of suspending the [[antenna feed]] with his brother, [[Helias Doundoulakis]], a civil engineer who was then working for [[Emery Roth]]. Doundoulakis identified the problem that a tower or tripod would have presented around the center, which is the most critical portion of the reflector. Instead, Doundoulakis' proposal of a revolutionary design, by suspending the [[antenna feed|feed]] from cables connected to towers, was more practical. Rather than having a massive tower in the center of the reflector, his design would save millions in construction costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

He presented his proposal to Cornell University for a suspension system of the [[antenna feed|feed]]. This suspension system would possess a doughnut or [[torus]]-type [[truss]] suspended by four cables from four towers, to provide along its edge a rail track intended for [[azimuth]]al positioning of the [[antenna feed|feed]]. A second [[truss]] in the form of an [[arch]] was to hang below and rotate on said rails through 360 degrees. The arch also provided rails onto which the unit supporting the feed would move to provide for the elevational positioning of the feed. A counter-weight would move symmetrically opposite to the feed position for overall stability. 
George informed his brother, [[Helias Doundoulakis]], to design the cable suspension system which was finally adopted for the Arecibo Antenna. A patent was filed on September 11, 1961, by [[Helias Doundoulakis]] for "A radio telescope having a scanning feed supported by a cable suspension over a stationary reflector"&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference| number = 3273156| y = 1966| m = 09| d = 13| inventor = Helias Doundoulakis| title = Radio Telescope having a scanning feed supported by a cable suspension over a stationary reflector}}&lt;/ref&gt; who designed the suspension system according to George's specifications.

''Advancement Devices'' was launched, under which [[William J. Casey]] first heard of the inventor. In WWII, Casey had been chief of the OSS' Secret Intelligence branch for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; He learned that Doundoulakis also served in the OSS, and had secured a contract from the "[[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Corps]] to produce a radar that could measure the trajectory of a mortar shell. But he lacked the capital to follow through on his bid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Following this lead, Casey ensured that all the necessary funding would accompany Doundoulakis’ future projects. Under Advancement Devices, and with contributions from Casey, Doundoulakis developed a stream of patents for electronics, television, and internal ballistic engines. 

One patent, the tri-rotor engine, became a matter of contention with the IRS in back taxes owed by Casey to the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Doundoulakis/Casey business partnership would beget a life-long friendship from, "the inventor who he had long subsidized."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Their bond was not only grounded in their prior service with the OSS but in an alliance that continued throughout Casey’s Congressional hearings prior to his [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)]] post. Doundoulakis was called to testify before the [[United States Congress]] on Casey's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually was sworn in and became head of the Securities and Exchange Commission under [[President Nixon]]. Afterward, under the [[presidency of Ronald Reagan]], Casey was appointed the director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].

==Personal==
George married Chrysanthe "Chris" (Markomihalakis) in [[Brooklyn]], New York, where they settled after the war, resettling in [[North Bellmore, New York]]. They had two sons and one daughter, and three grandchildren. 

During the 1980s, Leigh Fermor visited and stayed with George at his North Bellmore home. [[Patrick Leigh Fermor|Leigh Fermor]] visited him during one of the many celebrations for the [[Battle of Crete]] and [[Kidnap of Heinrich Kreipe|the abduction of Gen. Kreipe]], punctuating a friendship which had endured throughout both their lives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5455">[http://gpsa-online.org/ The '''Georgia Political Science Association''' (GPSA)] is the [[professional association]] for [[Political Science|political scientists]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States. Founded in 1968, the GPSA holds an annual conference in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in November. Conference participants are from Georgia, other U.S. states, and overseas. Although political scientists are in the [[majority]], the conference is definitely [[interdisciplinary]]. Participants have included political scientists, [[historians]], [[economists]], [[humanists]], [[sociologists]], [[criminologists]], [[anthropologists]], [[Public Administration|public administrators]], [[philosophers]], students, interested non-academics and many others. Currently, the membership numbers around 200 political scientists teaching in Georgia. The GPSA publishes a refereed online [[proceedings]] of the conference.

Both the [[University System of Georgia]] Board of Regents Academic Advisory Committee for Political Science and the [[European Union]] Studies Certificate Steering Committee traditionally meet during the conference.

The GPSA [[Board of Directors]] consists of seven officers and eight at-large board members. The GPSA [[Vice President]] and program chair organizes the annual conference program from proposals received by July 1 of each year. Panels and roundtables are assembled from the accepted proposals and individual papers.  Seven sessions of four concurrent panels each are spread over two days. Four to six presentations are assigned to each panel. All interested persons may submit proposals.

The GPSA has several [[awards]]. The McBrayer Award and an accompanying $500.00 cash [[prize]] is awarded in years when a paper of outstanding scholarship within the [[academic discipline]] of political science is presented in its entirety at the conference. The Donald T. Wells Award is given annually to a member for recognition of outstanding service to the Georgia Political Science Association. The Roger N. Pajari [[Undergraduate]] Paper Award is given annually to the best undergraduate paper submitted to meet the requirements of an undergraduate [[political science]] course taught in the state of Georgia and nominated by the [[professor]] teaching the course.

GPSA members participate in the activities of the [[American Political Science Association]], Southern Political Science Association and the [[American Society for Public Administration]]. [http://gpsa-online.org/questions-in-politics/ Question in Politics (QiP)] is the scholarly journal of the Georgia Political Science Association. The first volume of QiP was published in 2013 and this journal is the continuation of the earlier Proceedings of the Georgia Political Science Association.

When Kalema-Zikusoka was 25, she was appointed to be the veterinary officer for the Ugandan Wildlife Service, which later merged with Uganda's national parks to become the [[Uganda Wildlife Authority]]. She was first woman to hold that position. She pioneered the first wildlife translocation to restock Uganda's national parks following years of poaching during Uganda's civil wars.&lt;ref name="5R"/&gt;

As part of her veterinary research, she identified parasite transmission from humans to mountain gorillas as a significant risk factor for gorillas.&lt;ref name="6R"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kalema-Zikusoka |first=Gladys |last2=Rothman |first2=Jessica M. |last3=Fox |first3=Mark T. |date=January 2005 | title=Intestinal parasites and bacteria of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=59–63 |issn=0032-8332 |journal=Primates; Journal of Primatology |pmid=15338419 |doi=10.1007/s10329-004-0103-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her demonstration of pathways for human diseases to harm or kill gorillas, Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka, Lawrence Zikusoka, and Stephen Rubanga then founded [[Conservation Through Public Health]] to improve both human and ecological health in Africa.&lt;ref name="4R"/&gt; CTPH is a non-profit organisation based in Uganda and the USA that conducts programs that protect gorillas and other wildlife from human and livestock disease risk; that reduce human and livestock diseases in the vicinity of wildlife; that increase the local use of family planning; and that use Information/Communication Technology both to help local development and to educate people about the environment. Kalema-Zikusoka is the CEO of the organisation.&lt;ref name="4R"/&gt;

CTPH was founded in 2003. In 2015, CTPH established a program called ''Gorilla Conservation Coffee''. Under this arrangement, the non-profit improves the livelihood of the surrounding community by assisting in getting international market prices for the community's [[Arabica coffee]] crop. With increased incomes, the community's illnesses and disease burden is reduced. Hence less disease is transferred to the resident gorillas. Also, a small fee is charged and retained by the farmers, whenever tourists traverse their gardens, when on gorilla treks through the community.&lt;ref name="5R"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/magazine/Saving-the-gorilla-with-quality-coffee-/434746-4727930-la6ylq/index.html |title=Saving the gorilla with quality coffee |access-date=25 August 2018 |date=25 August 2018 |

==Honors, awards, and other recognitions==
Kalema-Zikusoka has received a number of honours, awards, and other public recognitions of her environmental and humanitarian work. In 2009, she won the Whitley Gold Award, the top prize awarded in what has been considered the "[[Whitley Awards (UK)|Green Oscars]]".&lt;ref name="3R"/&gt; In 2008, the [[San Diego Zoo]] gave her its Conservation-in-Action Award.&lt;ref name="4R"/&gt; In 2006, Kalema-Zikusoka was elected to an [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public|Ashoka Fellowship]].&lt;ref name="7R"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.exploregreen.com/dr-gladys-kalema-zikusoka/ | title=About Dr. Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka |access-date=10 June 2018 |date=2013 |publisher=Exploregreen.com |location=St. Louis, Missouri |author=Exploregreen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Seed Magazine]] named her one of their eight Revolutionary Minds in Science.&lt;ref name="7R"/&gt;

Kalema-Zikusoka was profiled in the BBC documentary, Gladys the African Vet. She has also been featured in documentaries in National Geographic, Animal Planet, MNet and Uganda Television.
She was chosen among nine international environmental leaders to write a letter to the next US President in [[Sierra Club]] Magazine, November/December 2008 issue.&lt;ref name="7R"/&gt;

In 2018, Dr. Kalema-Zikusoka was awarded the EarthCare Award by the [[United States]]-based [[Sierra Club]], in recognition of her "unique contribution to international environmental protection and conservation", as related to her work in environmental protection and co-existence between communities and mountain gorillas in Uganda. She received the award on 29 September 2018, at a ceremony that was held in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], in the United States.&lt;ref name="9R"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/magazine/Ugandan-wildlife-vet-gets-coveted-Sierra-Club-award/434746-4813808-hp1ul4z/index.html |title=Ugandan wildlife vet gets coveted Sierra Club award |access-date=20 October 2018 |date=20 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The EastAfrican]] |first=Bamuturaki | last=Musinguzi |location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16095">The term '''Hollow State''' is used to describe a set of governmental practices in which [[State (polity)|states]] contract with third parties (private companies) in order to distribute government services. In a hollow state there are many degrees of separation between the source of taxpayer funds and the final distribution of taxpayer-funded products or services. Services paid for by the state are produced by a vast network of providers and the task of the government is not to manage provision, but to negotiate contracts with providers. There is no "command and control" relationship between government and contractors. Contracts are managed by countless agencies and even more providers, there is no means of central record keeping or data management.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Brinton Milward, H. (2012). Hollow state. In H. K. Anheier, &amp; M. Juergensmayer (Eds.). The encyclopedia of global studies (pp. 808–809). London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Graeme. “The Hollow State: Rural Governance in China.” The China Quarterly, no. 203 (2010): 601-618. JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; A Hollow State has all the standard edifices of governance although most are under the influence of third-party organizations, either for-profit or non-profit entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2009/03/hollow-states-vs-failed-states.html|title=HOLLOW STATES vs. FAILED STATES - Global Guerrillas|website=globalguerrillas.typepad.com|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oied.ncsu.edu/selc/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Governing-the-Hollow-State.pdf|title=Covering Hollow State|last=Milward|first=Brinton|date=2000|website=|publisher=University of Arizona|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of government contracting goes back thousands of years to when [[Mercenary]] bands were utilized by the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Persian Empire|Persians]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. In the [[United States]], the history of government contracting is rooted in the history of English civil service. Throughout the 1600s, educated Englishmen could make a career out of negotiating the procurement of goods for local government, especially for the English military. This system was how much of the English military procurement was carried out, and was brought to the colonies by English settlers. The English military in the colonies was expected to obtain their own supplies locally. To this end, most military outfits employed a commissary general to obtain food and related supplies, and a quartermaster general to obtain supplies for construction, transportation, and weaponry. These officers had the authority to contract with local farmers and merchants. A version of this system was implemented by the [[Continental Congress]] during the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ago.noaa.gov/acquisition/docs/foundations_of_contracting_with_the_federal_government.pdf|title=The Foundations of Government Contracting|last=Keeney|first=Sandy|date=Summer 2007|website=NOAA.gov|publisher=NOAA|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend continued through the [[American Civil War]] and has grown and evolved into the modern system of [[government procurement]]. The United States government increasingly implements policy through a complicated network of providers. The system relies on the collaboration of multiple levels of government, for-profit, and non-profit entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative Public Management: New Strategies for local governments|last=Agranoff|first=R.|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brinton Milward, H. (2014). The increasingly hollow state: challenges and dilemmas for public administration. Asia Pacific Journal of Public Administration, 36(1), 70-79. doi:10.1080/23276665.2014.892275-&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ALONSO, J. M., ANDREWS, R., &amp; HODGKINSON, I. R. (2016). INSTITUTIONAL, IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL INFLUENCES ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING: EVIDENCE FROM ENGLAND. Public Administration, 94(1), 244-262.-&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the term "Hollow State" is shorter than the history of the practice, as [[capitalism]] emerged as a dominant social force, so did the influence of private contractors on government leaders. Brinton Milward, Director of the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona, uses the term Hollow State as a metaphor to describe the process and consequences of excessive government contracting.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, L. S. (2010). [A Government Out of Sight]. ''Social History'',''35''(2), 221-223.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of modern Hollow State iterations include:
* China, though often in rural areas as opposed to on a national scale&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Smith, G. (2010). The Hollow State: Rural Governance in China. ''The China Quarterly,'' (203), 601-618.&lt;/ref&gt;
* South Africa has been trending toward a Hollow State for years with moves empowering business over people &lt;ref&gt;The hollow state. (2015). ''Economist, 417''(8969), 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21684146-two-decades-after-south-africas-transition-non-racial-democracy-its|title=The hollow state|date=2015-12-19|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Zimbabwe is an example of current Hollow State.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globaldashboard.org/2008/12/06/what-does-a-hollow-state-look-like/|title=What does a Hollow State look like?|last=Edwards|first=Charlie|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrastructure ==
The primary purpose of the hollow state is to function as a multi-organizational structure through which policy is designed and executed. The metaphor "Hollow State" is meant to be understood as a system consisting of units of government separated from their outputs but still linked by negotiation or contract. When nonprofit organizations receive contracts or grants to deliver public goods or services, the delegating agency assumes a sufficient level of capacity to implement the project or deliver the service. However, if the nonprofit community-based organizations are too limited in capacity to carry out their grants or contracts, then a disconnect occurs in the hollow state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fredricksen, Patricia, and Rosanne London. "Disconnect in the Hollow State: The Pivotal Role of Organizational Capacity in Community-Based Development Organizations." Public Administration Review 60, no. 3 (2000): 230-39. {{jstor|977465}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary reasons privatization occurs is because of the severe capacity that limitations force the government to contract for services it does not have the ability to provide.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Milward, H. Brinton. "Nonprofit Contracting and the Hollow State." Public Administration Review 54, no. 1 (1994): 73-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually this would involve a private development network supported by a public administration like the [[Chamber of commerce|Chamber of Commerce]] and several private businesses. There are 2 types of networks that exist in the hollow state: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal networks consist of 3 types, policy making, resource exchange, and project based, all of which are between governments and non-governmental organizations. Vertical networks are the collaborations that occur between federal, state, and local governments.

The purpose of this collaboration is to devise strategy for business retention, expansion, or recruitment. The reason city economics developers reach out to surrounding organizations and become multiple networks is due to the fact economic policy is designed and implemented under ambiguity and uncertainty. As complexities increase, grassroots initiatives become more sought after. Most nonprofit organizations are started with passion and enthusiasm for resolving a particular issue. Many of these are the small grassroots or community-based nonprofits that meet important human service needs for a specific geographic area or population.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Balance and Competition: Norris- Tirrell, Dorthy. 2014. "The Changing Role of Private, Nonprofit Organizations in the Development and Delivery of Human Services in the United States.” Journal of Health &amp; Human Services Administration 37, no. 3: 304-326. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed October 21, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the need for more nongovernmental actors to deliver local services hence more actors equates to more hollowing of the state. In fact publicly funded social services are an increasingly important component of social provision spending and accounft for approximately one-fifth to today's welfare state expenditures.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Allocation of Funding:  Marwell, Nicole P., and Aaron Gullickson. 2013. "Inequality in the Spatial Allocation of Social Services: Government Contracts to Nonprofit Organizations in New York City." Social Service Review 87, no. 2: 319-353. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed October 24, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Substituting from a stable, linear government for complex networks may raise questions of allocation deliberations being solely prompted by cost/ efficiency not taking into account taxpayers other values.

== Contracting ==
The Hollow State refers to the extent to which governments are directly involved in providing services.&lt;sup&gt;[[Hollow state#cite note-4|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Contracting out is when government allows a non-government institution to operate under the governments name to provide a public service. Hollowing out of government by allocating services to private organizations has three imperatives: the need to attract investment to compensate for lost revenues and meet the political imperatives set by the country and provincial governments; the need to receive inspection teams from higher levels of government; and "soft centralization" of township bureaus, which are placed under country or provincial government control.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Advocates of privatization often make the point that government can provide or arrange for citizens to receive a service without the government actually providing it,&lt;sup&gt;[[Hollow state#cite note-:2-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; by contracting out.  A government intent on privatization would decide what it wanted done and then contract with the [[private sector]] to provide the good or the service.&lt;sup&gt;[[Hollow state#cite note-:2-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; The federal government has always relied on state and local governments to distribute and provide services with money funded by the federal level. However, community-based development organizations have problems with accountability, responsiveness, and sometimes lose their connections with municipalities. This can lead to experiencing disparities in fundraising, fiscal and human resource management practices, and even skills in building and maintaining partnerships and gaining political support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fredericksen|first=Patricia|year=2000|title=Disconnect in the Hollow State: The Pivotal Role of Organizational Capacity in Community Based Development Organizations|url=|journal=American Society for Public Administration|volume=60|pages=230–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contracting out or privatization also redirects the funds that would otherwise go to the state and local government to private organizations. It can be said that there is a negative relationship between the neighborhoods where the central offices of those organizations are located, and neighborhood disadvantage, largely because so many distributive organization headquarters are located in downtown, higher-income areas. [[Subsidy|Government funding]] of nonprofit agencies in the United States of America increased during the grant-in-aid explosion of the 1960s and 1970s and continued during the Reagan and Bush administrations under the banners of privatization, limited budgets, and getting government off the backs of those it regulates.&lt;sup&gt;[[Hollow state#cite note-:2-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It should be noted that not all states who adopt the Hollow State find it successful and more often than not those states fail and lose their political goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2009/03/hollow-states-vs-failed-states.html|title=Hollow States vs. Failed States|last=Robb|first=John|date=2009|website=Global Gerrillas|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There are several outspoken criticisms of government contracting practices. Critics claim the hollow state can be inefficient, dangerous, and may violate human rights. The hollow state can effectively destroy a society's interests in humanities as money leads to a monopoly and/or oligarchy. A hollow state can be unreliable. When a government sector contracts out, there can be many problems. The hollow state is exemplified by increased reliance on third-party producers, which may result in a lack of oversight expertise in government.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Contracting private organizations for warfare can lead to unethical methods and the hollow state can effectively destroy a society's interests in humanities as money leads to a monopoly and/or oligarchy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Bryer, T. t.(2008). Warning: The Hollow State Can Be Deadly. ''Public Administration Review, 68''(3), 587-590. doi:10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.00896.x
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryer, T. A. (2008). Warning: The Hollow State Can Be Deadly. Public Administration Review, (3). 587&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delfeld, H. (2014).

The problems of managing non-governmental, contracted organizations are extensive and severe. The number of degrees of separation between the source of funds and the implementation of those funds creates diminishing quality of returns with each new layer. Managers at every level are forced to deal with an uncertain budget cycle, long waits for payment for services rendered, financial crises, billing problems, frequently changing and contradictory rules and much more. Another thing to consider is the existence of the "principle-agent" issue, wherein the "principle" (the person giving the contract) can never have as much information about the requirements of the job than the "agent" (the one being contracted). This information disparity causes the principle to have unrealistic expectations and allows the agent to mislead the principle as to aspects such as cost, time, and human resources.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Administrations that already exist within a country moving toward a Hollow State begin to be parsed in seemingly innocent fashion. In the name of "efficiency" government interests are delegated to private contractor, who will then often subcontract to other groups. For example, contractors hired to patch roofs with blue tarp for FEMA after Katrina received payment of "between $149 and $175 per (10ftx10ft square)." This price was comparable to installing entirely new roofs at the time. However; through a long string of subcontractors, the firms performing the final installations of the tarps "earned as little as $2 per 10ftx10ft square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Catastrophe in the Making|last=Freudenburg|first=William|publisher=Island Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=136|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taxpayers end up paying exorbitantly as business interests takes complete control over the process of procurement.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, L.

'''IT risk management''' is the application of [[risk management]] methods to [[information technology]] in order to manage [[IT risk]], i.e.:
:''The business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of IT within an enterprise or organization''
&lt;!----- transclusion --------&gt;
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
IT risk management can be considered a component of a wider [[enterprise risk management]] system.&lt;ref name=RISKITW&gt;[http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/Documents/RiskIT-FW-18Nov09-Research.pdf ISACA THE RISK IT FRAMEWORK (registration required)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment, maintenance and continuous update of an [[Information security management system]] (ISMS) provide a strong indication that a company is using a systematic approach for the identification, assessment and management of information security risks.&lt;ref name=ENISAFULL&gt;[http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/cr/risk-management-inventory/files/deliverables/risk-management-principles-and-inventories-for-risk-management-risk-assessment-methods-and-tools/at_download/fullReport Enisa Risk management, Risk assessment inventory, page 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different methodologies have been proposed to manage IT risks, each of them divided into processes and steps.&lt;ref name=Vacca1&gt;{{cite book

According to the [[Risk IT]] framework,&lt;ref name=RISKITW/&gt; this encompasses not only the negative impact of operations and service delivery which can bring destruction or reduction of the value of the organization, but also the benefit enabling risk associated to missing opportunities to use technology to enable or enhance business or the IT project management for aspects like overspending or late delivery with adverse business impact.{{clarify|date=September 2017|post-text=incomprehensible sentence}}

Because [[Risk#Risk as a vector quantity|risk]] is strictly tied to uncertainty, [[decision theory]] should be applied to manage risk as a science, i.e. rationally making choices under uncertainty.

Generally speaking, [[risk]] is the product of likelihood times [[result|impact]] (Risk = Likelihood * Impact).&lt;ref&gt;"Risk is a combination of the likelihood of an occurrence of a hazardous event or exposure(s) and the severity of injury or ill health that can be caused by the event or exposure(s)" (OHSAS 18001:2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure of an IT risk can be determined as a product of threat, vulnerability and [[asset (computing)|asset]] values:&lt;ref name=Vacca&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;Risk = Threat * Vulnerability * Asset&lt;/math&gt;

A more current Risk management framework for IT Risk would be the TIK framework:
:&lt;math&gt;Risk = ((Vulnerability * Threat) / Counter Measure) * Asset Value at Risk&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://it-risk-management.com/ IT Risk Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

&lt;!----- transclusion --------&gt;
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
The [[Certified Information Systems Auditor]] Review Manual 2006 produced by ISACA, an international professional association focused on IT Governance, provides the following definition of risk management: ''"Risk management is the process of identifying [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and [[threat (computer)|threats]] to the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives, and deciding what [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]], if any, to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level, based on the value of the information resource to the organization."''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last = ISACA
 | title = CISA Review Manual 2006
 | publisher = [http://www.isaca.org/ Information Systems Audit and Control Association]
 | year = 2006
 | pages = 85
 | isbn = 1-933284-15-3 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
&lt;!----- transclusion END HERE BUT FOLLOWS --------&gt;

There is two things in this definition that may need some clarification. First, the ''process'' of risk management is an ongoing iterative [[Business process|process]]. It must be repeated indefinitely. The business environment is constantly changing and new [[threat (computer)|threats]] and [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] emerge every day. Second, the choice of [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] ([[security controls|controls]]) used to manage risks must strike a balance between productivity, cost, effectiveness of the countermeasure, and the value of the informational asset being protected.

''[[Risk management]] is the process that allows IT managers to balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability by protecting the IT systems and data that support their organizations’ missions. This process is not unique to the IT environment; indeed it pervades decision-making in all areas of our daily lives''.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

The head of an organizational unit must ensure that the organization has the capabilities needed to accomplish its mission. These mission owners must determine the security capabilities that their IT systems must have to provide the desired level of mission support in the face of real world [[threat (computer)|threat]]s. Most organizations have tight budgets for IT security; therefore, IT security spending must be reviewed as thoroughly as other management decisions. A well-structured risk management methodology, when used effectively, can help management identify appropriate [[security controls|controls]] for providing the mission-essential security capabilities.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
[[File:Osa metamodel v003.png|thumb|Relationships between IT security entity]]

Risk management in the IT world is quite a complex, multi faced activity, with a lot of relations with other complex activities. The picture to the right shows the relationships between different related terms.

The American [[National Information Assurance Training and Education Center]] defines risk management in the IT field as:&lt;ref name="NIATEC Glossary of terms"&gt;[http://niatec.info/Glossary.aspx?term=4253&amp;alpha=R NIATEC Glossary of terms]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The total process to identify, control, and minimize the impact of uncertain events. The objective of the risk management program is to reduce risk and obtain and maintain DAA approval. The process facilitates the management of security risks by each level of management throughout the system life cycle. The approval process consists of three elements: [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]], certification, and approval.''
# ''An element of managerial science concerned with the identification, measurement, control, and minimization of uncertain events. An effective risk management program encompasses the following four phases:''
##a ''Risk assessment, as derived from an evaluation of threats and vulnerabilities.''
## ''Management decision.''
## ''Control implementation.''
## ''Effectiveness review.''
# ''The total process of identifying, measuring, and minimizing uncertain events affecting AIS resources. It includes [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]], cost benefit analysis, safeguard selection, security test and evaluation, safeguard implementation, and systems review.''
# ''The total process of identifying, controlling, and eliminating or minimizing uncertain events that may affect system resources. lt includes risk analysis, cost benefit analysis, selection, implementation and test, security evaluation of safeguards, and overall security review.''

== Risk management as part of enterprise risk management ==
Some organizations have, and many others should have, a comprehensive [[Enterprise risk management]] (ERM) in place. The four objective categories addressed, according to [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission]] (COSO) are:
* Strategy - high-level goals, aligned with and supporting the organization's mission
* Operations - effective and efficient use of resources
* Financial Reporting - reliability of operational and financial reporting
* Compliance - compliance with applicable laws and regulations
According to the [[Risk IT]] framework by [[ISACA]],&lt;ref name=riskit&gt;The Risk IT Framework by ISACA, {{ISBN|978-1-60420-111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; IT risk is transversal to all four categories. The IT risk should be managed in the framework of Enterprise risk management: [[Risk appetite]] and Risk sensitivity of the whole enterprise should guide the IT risk management process. ERM should provide the context and business objectives to IT risk management

== Risk management methodology ==
[[File:The Risk Management Process.png|thumb|ENISA: The Risk Management Process, according to ISO Standard 13335]]
The term [[methodology]] means an organized set of principles and rules that drive action in a particular field of knowledge.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt;
A methodology does not describe specific methods; nevertheless it does specify several processes that need to be followed. These processes constitute a generic framework. They may be broken down in sub-processes, they may be combined, or their sequence may change. However, any risk management exercise must carry out these processes in one form or another, The following table compares the processes foreseen by three leading standards.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt; The [[ISACA]] [[Risk IT]] framework is more recent. The Risk IT Practitioner-Guide&lt;ref name=RISKITP&gt;[http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/The-Risk-IT-Practitioner-Guide.aspx The Risk IT Practitioner Guide, Appendix 3 ISACA] {{ISBN|978-1-60420-116-1}} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; compares Risk IT and ISO 27005.
The overall comparison is illustrated in the following table.
{| class="wikitable"

Due to the probabilistic nature and the need of cost benefit analysis, IT risks are managed following a process that according to [[NIST]] SP 800-30 can be divided in the following steps:&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
# [[risk assessment]],
# [[#Risk mitigation|risk mitigation]], and
# [[evaluation]] and [[wikt:assessment|assessment]].

Effective risk management must be totally integrated into the [[Systems Development Life Cycle]].&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

Information [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] conducted on applications, computer installations, networks and systems under development should be undertaken using structured methodologies.&lt;ref name=SOGP&gt;[https://www.isfsecuritystandard.com Standard of Good Practice by Information Security Forum (ISF) Section SM3.4 Information risk analysis methodologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context establishment ==
This step is the first step in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO/IEC 27005]] framework. Most of the elementary activities are foreseen as the first sub process of Risk assessment according to [[NIST]] SP 800-30.
This step implies the acquisition of all relevant information about the organization and the determination of the basic criteria, purpose, scope and boundaries of risk management activities and the organization in charge of risk management activities. The purpose is usually the compliance with legal requirements and provide evidence of due diligence supporting an [[Information security management system|ISMS]] that can be certified. The scope can be an incident reporting plan, a [[business continuity plan]].

Another area of application can be the certification of a product.

Criteria include the risk evaluation, risk acceptance and impact evaluation criteria. These are conditioned by:&lt;ref name=ISO27005&gt;ISO/IEC, "Information technology -- Security techniques-Information security risk management" ISO/IEC FIDIS 27005:2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* legal and regulatory requirements
* the strategic value for the business of information processes
* [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] expectations
* negative consequences for the reputation of the organization

Establishing the scope and boundaries, the organization should be studied: its mission, its values, its structure; its strategy, its locations and cultural environment. The constraints (budgetary, cultural, political, technical) of the organization are to be collected and documented as guide for next steps.

=== Organization for security management ===
The set up of the organization in charge of risk management is foreseen as partially fulfilling the requirement to provide the resources needed to establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve an ISMS.&lt;ref name=ISO27001&gt;ISO/IEC 27001&lt;/ref&gt; The main roles inside this organization are:&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
* Senior Management
* [[Chief information officer]] (CIO)
* System and Information owners
* the business and functional managers
* the [[ISSO (IT)|Information System Security Officer]] (ISSO) or [[Chief information security officer]] (CISO)
* IT Security Practitioners
* Security Awareness Trainers

== Risk assessment ==
[[File:Octave like.jpg|thumb|ENISA: Risk assessment inside risk management]]
Risk Management is a recurrent activity that deals with the analysis, planning, implementation, control and monitoring of implemented measurements and the enforced security policy. On the contrary, Risk Assessment is executed at discrete time points (e.g. once a year, on demand, etc.) and – until the performance of the next assessment - provides a temporary view of assessed risks and while parameterizing the entire Risk Management process.
This view of the relationship of Risk Management to Risk Assessment is depicted in figure as adopted from OCTAVE.&lt;ref name=ENISAFULL/&gt;

Risk assessment is often conducted in more than one iteration, the first being a high-level assessment to identify high risks, while the other iterations detailed the analysis of the major risks and other risks.

According to [[National Information Assurance Training and Education Center]] risk assessment in the IT field is:&lt;ref name="NIATEC Glossary of terms"/&gt;
# ''A study of the vulnerabilities, threats, likelihood, loss or impact, and theoretical effectiveness of security measures. Managers use the results of a risk assessment to develop security requirements and specifications.''
# ''The process of evaluating threats and vulnerabilities, known and postulated, to determine expected loss and establish the degree of acceptability to system operations.''
# ''An identification of a specific ADP facility's assets, the threats to these assets, and the ADP facility's vulnerability to those threats.''
# An analysis of system assets and vulnerabilities to establish an expected loss from certain events based on estimated probabilities of the occurrence of those events. The purpose of a risk assessment is to determine if countermeasures are adequate to reduce the probability of loss or the impact of loss to an acceptable level. ''
#''A management tool which provides a systematic approach for determining the relative value and sensitivity of computer installation assets, assessing vulnerabilities, assessing loss expectancy or perceived risk exposure levels, assessing existing protection features and additional protection alternatives or acceptance of risks and documenting management decisions. Decisions for implementing additional protection features are normally based on the existence of a reasonable ratio between cost/benefit of the safeguard and sensitivity/value of the assets to be protected. Risk assessments may vary from an informal review of a small scale microcomputer installation to a more formal and fully documented analysis (i. e., risk analysis) of a large scale computer installation. Risk assessment methodologies may vary from qualitative or quantitative approaches to any combination of these two approaches.''

=== ISO 27005 framework ===
Risk assessment receives as input the output of the previous step [[#Context establishment|Context establishment]]; the output is the list of assessed risks prioritized according to risk evaluation criteria.
The process can be divided into the following steps:&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;
* [[Risk analysis (engineering)|Risk analysis]], further divided in:
** [[#Risk identification|Risk identification]]
** [[#Risk estimation|Risk estimation]]
** [[#Risk evaluation|Risk evaluation]]
The following table compares these ISO 27005 processes with [[Risk IT]] framework processes:&lt;ref name=RISKITP/&gt;

|}
The [[ISO/IEC 17799|ISO/IEC 27002:2005]] Code of practice for information security management recommends the following be examined during a risk assessment:
*[[security policy]],
*[[organization]] of information security,
*[[asset management]],
*[[human resources]] security,
* [[physical security|physical]] and [[environmental security]],
*[[communications]] and operations management,
*[[access control]],
*information systems acquisition, development and maintenance, (see [[Systems Development Life Cycle]])
*information security [[incident management]],
* [[business continuity]] management, and
* [[regulatory compliance]].

==== Risk identification ====
[[File:2010-T10-ArchitectureDiagram.png|thumb|300px|OWASP: relationship between threat agent and business impact]]
Risk identification states what could cause a potential loss; the following are to be identified:&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;
* [[asset (computing)|assets]], primary (i.e. Business processes and related information) and supporting (i.e. hardware, software, personnel, site, organization structure)
* [[Threat (computer)|threat]]s
* existing and planned security measures
* vulnerabilities
* consequence
* related business processes
The output of sub process is made up of:

* list of asset and related business processes to be risk managed with associated list of threats, existing and planned security measures
* list of vulnerabilities unrelated to any identified threats
* list of incident scenarios with their consequences.

==== Risk estimation ====
There are two methods of risk assessment in information security field, [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitative]].&lt;ref name="CISSP-Guide"&gt;{{cite book | title=Official (ISC)2 Guide to CISSP CBK | publisher=Auerbach Publications | year=2007 | pages=1065 | location=Risk Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purely quantitative risk assessment is a mathematical calculation based on security metrics on the [[asset (computing)|asset]] (system or application).
For each [[risk scenario]], taking into consideration the different [[risk factor (computing)|risk factors]] a [[Single loss expectancy]] (SLE) is determined. Then, considering the probability of occurrence on a given period basis, for example the annual rate of occurrence (ARO), the [[Annualized Loss Expectancy]] is determined as the product of ARO X SLE.&lt;ref name="Vacca"/&gt;
It is important to point out that the values of [[asset (computing)|assets]] to be considered are those of all involved assets, not only the value of the directly affected resource.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, if you consider the risk scenario of a Laptop theft threat, you should consider the value of the data (a related asset) contained in the computer and the reputation and liability of the company (other assets) deriving from the lost of availability and confidentiality of the data that could be involved.
It is easy to understand that [[intangible asset]]s (data, reputation, liability) can be worth much more than physical resources at risk (the laptop hardware in the example).&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-01-27/politics/va.data.theft_1_laptop-personal-data-single-veteran?_s=PM:POLITICS CNN article about a class action settlement for a Veteran Affair stolen laptop]&lt;/ref&gt;
Intangible asset value can be huge, but is not easy to evaluate: this can be a consideration against a pure quantitative approach.&lt;ref name=FAIR/&gt;

Qualitative risk assessment (three to five steps evaluation, from Very High to Low) is performed when the organization requires a risk assessment be performed in a relatively short time or to meet a small budget, a significant quantity of relevant data is not available, or the persons performing the assessment don't have the sophisticated mathematical, financial, and risk assessment expertise required.&lt;ref name="CISSP-Guide" /&gt; Qualitative risk assessment can be performed in a shorter period of time and with less data. Qualitative risk assessments are typically performed through interviews of a sample of personnel from all relevant groups within an organization charged with the security of the asset being assessed. Qualitative risk assessments are descriptive versus measurable.
Usually a qualitative classification is done followed by a quantitative evaluation of the highest risks to be compared to the costs of security measures.

Risk estimation has as input the output of risk analysis and can be split in the following steps:
* assessment of the consequences through the valuation of assets
* assessment of the likelihood of the incident (through threat and vulnerability valuation)
* assign values to the likelihood and consequence of the risks
The output is the list of risks with value levels assigned. It can be documented in a [[risk register]].

Risks arising from security threats and adversary attacks may be particularly difficult to estimate. This difficulty is made worse because, at least for any IT system connected to the Internet, any adversary with intent and capability may attack because physical closeness or access is not necessary. Some initial models have been proposed for this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Global adversarial capability modeling|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7120797|journal = 2015 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime)|date = 2015-05-01|pages = 1–21|doi = 10.1109/ECRIME.2015.7120797|first = J.|last = Spring|first2 = S.|last2 = Kern|first3 = A.|last3 = Summers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During risk estimation there are generally three values of a given asset, one for the loss of one of the [[CIA triad|CIA]] properties: [[Information security|Confidentiality]], Integrity, [[Availability]].&lt;ref name="BS7799"&gt;British Standard Institute "ISMSs-Part 3: Guidelines for information security risk management" BS 7799-3:2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Risk evaluation ====
The risk evaluation process receives as input the output of risk analysis process. It compares each risk level against the risk acceptance criteria and prioritise the risk list with risk treatment indications.

=== NIST SP 800 30 framework ===
[[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 3-1.png|thumb|Risk assessment according NIST SP 800-30 Figure 3-1]]
To determine the likelihood of a future adverse event, [[threat (computer)|threat]]s to an IT system must be in conjunction with the potential [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and the [[security controls|controls]] in place for the IT system.&lt;br /&gt;
Impact refers to the magnitude of harm that could be caused by a threat’s exercise of vulnerability. The level of impact is governed by the potential mission impacts and produces a relative value for the IT assets and resources affected (e.g., the criticality sensitivity of the IT system components and data). The risk assessment methodology encompasses nine primary steps:&lt;ref name=SP80030&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Step 1 System Characterization
* Step 2 Threat Identification
* Step 3 Vulnerability Identification
* Step 4 Control Analysis
* Step 5 Likelihood Determination
* Step 6 Impact Analysis
* Step 7 Risk Determination
* Step 8 Control Recommendations
* Step 9 Results Documentation

== Risk mitigation ==
Risk mitigation, the second process according to SP 800-30, the third according to ISO 27005 of risk management, involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the risk assessment process.
Because the elimination of all risk is usually impractical or close to impossible, it is the responsibility of senior management and functional and business managers to use the least-cost approach and implement the most appropriate controls to decrease mission risk to an acceptable level, with minimal adverse impact on the organization’s resources and mission.

=== ISO 27005 framework ===
The risk treatment process aim at selecting security measures to:
* reduce
* retain
* avoid
* transfer
risk and produce a risk treatment plan, that is the output of the process with the residual risks subject to the acceptance of management.

There are some list to select appropriate security measures,&lt;ref name=ISO27001/&gt; but is up to the single organization to choose the most appropriate one according to its business strategy, constraints of the environment and circumstances. The choice should be rational and documented. The importance of accepting a risk that is too costly to reduce is very high and led to the fact that risk acceptance is considered a separate process.&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;

Risk transfer apply were the risk has a very high impact but is not easy to reduce significantly the likelihood by means of security controls: the [[insurance]] premium should be compared against the mitigation costs, eventually evaluating some mixed strategy to partially treat the risk. Another option is to outsource the risk to somebody more efficient to manage the risk.&lt;ref&gt;Costas Lambrinoudakisa, Stefanos Gritzalisa, Petros Hatzopoulosb, Athanasios N. Yannacopoulosb, Sokratis Katsikasa, "A formal model for pricing information systems insurance contracts", Computer Standards &amp; Interfaces - Volume 27, Issue 5, June 2005, Pages 521-532 {{doi|10.1016/j.csi.2005.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk avoidance describe any action where ways of conducting business are changed to avoid any risk occurrence. For example, the choice of not storing sensitive information about customers can be an avoidance for the risk that customer data can be stolen.

The ''residual risks'', i.e. the risk remaining after risk treatment decision have been taken, should be estimated to ensure that sufficient protection is achieved. If the residual risk is unacceptable, the risk treatment process should be iterated.

=== NIST SP 800 30 framework ===
[[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-2.png|thumb|Risk mitigation methodology flow chart from NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-2]]
[[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-1.png|thumb|Risk mitigation action point according to NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-1]]
Risk mitigation is a systematic methodology used by senior management to reduce mission risk.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Risk mitigation can be achieved through any of the following risk mitigation options:
* '''Risk Assumption'''. To accept the potential risk and continue operating the IT system or to implement controls to lower the risk to an acceptable level
* '''Risk Avoidance'''. To avoid the risk by eliminating the risk cause and/or consequence (e.g., forgo certain functions of the system or shut down the system when risks are identified)
* '''Risk Limitation'''. To limit the risk by implementing controls that minimize the adverse impact of a threat’s exercising a vulnerability (e.g., use of supporting, preventive, detective controls)
* '''Risk Planning'''. To manage risk by developing a risk mitigation plan that prioritizes, implements, and maintains controls
* ''' Research and Acknowledgement'''. To lower the risk of loss by acknowledging the vulnerability or flaw and researching controls to correct the vulnerability
* '''Risk Transference'''. To transfer the risk by using other options to compensate for the loss, such as purchasing insurance.
Address the greatest risks and strive for sufficient risk mitigation at the lowest cost, with minimal impact on other mission capabilities: this is the suggestion contained in&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

== Risk communication ==
{{main article|Risk_management#Risk_communication}}
Risk communication is a horizontal process that interacts bidirectionally with all other processes of risk management. Its purpose is to establish a common understanding of all aspect of risk among all the organization's stakeholder. Establishing a common understanding is important, since it influences decisions to be taken. The Risk Reduction Overview method &lt;ref&gt;[http://rro.sourceforge.net RRO website]&lt;/ref&gt; is specifically designed for this process. It presents a comprehensible overview of the coherence of risks, measures and residual risks to achieve this common understanding.

== Risk monitoring and review ==
Risk management is an ongoing, never ending process. Within this process implemented security measures are regularly monitored and reviewed to ensure that they work as planned and that changes in the environment rendered them ineffective. Business requirements, vulnerabilities and threats can change over the time.

Regular audits should be scheduled and should be conducted by an independent party, i.e. somebody not under the control of whom is responsible for the implementations or daily management of [[Information security management system|ISMS]].

== IT evaluation and assessment ==
Security controls should be validated. Technical controls are possible complex systems that are to tested and verified. The hardest part to validate is people knowledge of procedural controls and the effectiveness of the real application in daily business of the security procedures.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

[[Vulnerability assessment (computing)|Vulnerability assessment]], both internal and external, and [[Penetration test]] are instruments for verifying the status of security controls.

[[Information technology security audit]] is an organizational and procedural control with the aim of evaluating security.
The IT systems of most organization are evolving quite rapidly. Risk management should cope with these changes through change authorization after risk re evaluation of the affected systems and processes and periodically review the risks and mitigation actions.&lt;ref name=Vacca/&gt;

Monitoring system events according to a security monitoring strategy, an incident response plan and security validation and metrics are fundamental activities to assure that an optimal level of security is obtained.&lt;br /&gt;
It is important to monitor the new vulnerabilities, apply procedural and technical security controls like regularly [[Patch (computing)|updating software]], and evaluate other kinds of controls to deal with [[zero-day attack]]s.

The attitude of involved people to [[benchmarking|benchmark]] against [[best practice]] and follow the seminars of [[professional association]]s in the sector are factors to assure the state of art of an organization IT risk management practice.

== Integrating risk management into system development life cycle ==
Effective risk management must be totally integrated into the [[Systems Development Life Cycle|SDLC]]. An IT system’s SDLC has five phases: initiation, development or acquisition, implementation, operation or maintenance, and disposal. The risk management methodology is the same regardless of the SDLC phase for which the assessment is being conducted. Risk management is an iterative process that can be performed during each major phase of the SDLC.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

|+ align="center" |'''Table 2-1 Integration of Risk Management into the SDLC'''&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
|-
! SDLC Phases!!Phase Characteristics!!Support from Risk Management Activities
|-
| Phase 1: Initiation||The need for an IT system is expressed and the purpose and scope of the IT system is documented||Identified risks are used to support the development of the system requirements, including security requirements, and a security concept of operations (strategy)
|-
| style=white-space:nowrap| Phase 2: Development or Acquisition||The IT system is designed, purchased, programmed, developed, or otherwise constructed||The risks identified during this phase can be used to support the security analyses of the IT system that may lead to architecture and design tradeoffs during system development
|-
| Phase 3: Implementation||The system security features should be configured, enabled, tested, and verified||The risk management process supports the assessment of the system implementation against its requirements and within its modeled operational environment. Decisions regarding risks identified must be made prior to system operation
|-
| style=white-space:nowrap|Phase 4: Operation or Maintenance||The system performs its functions. Typically the system is being modified on an ongoing basis through the addition of hardware and software and by changes to organizational processes, policies, and procedures||Risk management activities are performed for periodic system reauthorization (or reaccreditation) or whenever major changes are made to an IT system in its operational, production environment (e.g., new system interfaces)
|-
| Phase 5: Disposal||This phase may involve the disposition of information, hardware, and software. Activities may include moving, archiving, discarding, or destroying information and sanitizing the hardware and software||Risk management activities are performed for system components that will be disposed of or replaced to ensure that the hardware and software are properly disposed of, that residual data is appropriately handled, and that system migration is conducted in a secure and systematic manner

[[NIST]] SP 800-64&lt;ref name=NIST80064&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-64-Rev2/SP800-64-Revision2.pdf 800-64 NIST Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle]&lt;/ref&gt; is devoted to this topic.

Early integration of security in the SDLC enables agencies to maximize return on investment in their security programs, through:&lt;ref name=NIST80064/&gt;
* Early identification and mitigation of security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, resulting in lower cost of security control implementation and vulnerability mitigation;
* Awareness of potential engineering challenges caused by mandatory security controls;
* Identification of shared [[Security service (telecommunication)|security services]] and reuse of security strategies and tools to reduce development cost and schedule while improving security posture through proven methods and techniques; and
* Facilitation of informed executive decision making through comprehensive risk management in a timely manner.
This guide&lt;ref name=NIST80064/&gt; focuses on the information security components of the SDLC. First, descriptions of the key security roles and responsibilities that are needed in most information system developments are provided. Second, sufficient information about the SDLC is provided to allow a person who is unfamiliar with the SDLC process to understand the relationship between information security and the SDLC.
The document integrates the security steps into the linear, sequential (a.k.a. waterfall) SDLC. The five-step SDLC cited in the document is an example of one method of development and is not intended to mandate this methodology.
Lastly, SP 800-64 provides insight into IT projects and initiatives that are not as clearly defined as SDLC-based developments, such as service-oriented architectures, cross-organization projects, and IT facility developments.

Security can be incorporated into information systems acquisition, development and maintenance by implementing effective security practices in the following areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.internet2.edu/confluence/display/itsg2/Information+Systems+Acquisition%2C+Development%2C+and+Maintenance+%28ISO+12%29 EDUCAUSE Dashboard ISO 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Security requirements for information systems
* Correct processing in applications
* Cryptographic controls
* Security of system files
* Security in development and support processes
* Technical vulnerability management

Information systems security begins with incorporating security into the requirements process for any new application or system enhancement. Security should be designed into the system from the beginning. Security requirements are presented to the vendor during the requirements phase of a product purchase. Formal testing should be done to determine whether the product meets the required security specifications prior to purchasing the product.

Correct processing in applications is essential in order to prevent errors and to mitigate loss, unauthorized modification or misuse of information. Effective coding techniques include validating input and output data, protecting message integrity using encryption, checking for processing errors, and creating activity logs.

Applied properly, cryptographic controls provide effective mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of information. An institution should develop policies on the use of encryption, including proper key management. Disk Encryption is one way to protect data at rest. Data in transit can be protected from alteration and unauthorized viewing using SSL certificates issued through a Certificate Authority that has implemented a Public Key Infrastructure.

System files used by applications must be protected in order to ensure the integrity and stability of the application. Using source code repositories with version control, extensive testing, production back-off plans, and appropriate access to program code are some effective measures that can be used to protect an application's files.

Security in development and support processes is an essential part of a comprehensive quality assurance and production control process, and would usually involve training and continuous oversight by the most experienced staff.

Applications need to be monitored and patched for technical vulnerabilities. Procedures for applying patches should include evaluating the patches to determine their appropriateness, and whether or not they can be successfully removed in case of a negative impact.

== Critique of risk management as a methodology ==
Risk management as a scientific methodology has been criticized as being shallow.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt; Major IT risk management programmes for large organizations, such as mandated by the US [[FISMA#Critique|Federal Information Security Management Act]], have been criticized.

By avoiding the complexity that accompanies the formal probabilistic model of risks and uncertainty, risk management looks more like a process that attempts to guess rather than formally predict the future on the basis of statistical evidence. It is highly subjective in assessing the value of assets, the likelihood of threats occurrence and the significance of the impact.

However, a better way to deal with the subject has not emerged.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt;

== Risk managements methods ==

It is quite hard to list most of the methods that at least partially support the IT risk management process. Efforts in this direction were done by:
* [[NIST]] Description of Automated Risk Management Packages That NIST/NCSC Risk Management Research Laboratory Has Examined, updated 1991
* [[ENISA]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/cr/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra-methods ENISA, Inventory of Risk Management / Risk Assessment Methods]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006; a list of methods and tools is available on line with a comparison engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rm-inv.enisa.europa.eu/rm_ra_methods.html Inventory of Risk Management / Risk Assessment Methods]&lt;/ref&gt; Among them the most widely used are:&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt;
** [[CRAMM]] Developed by British government is compliant to [[ISO/IEC 17799]], [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLBA) and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA)
** [[EBIOS]] developed by the French government it is compliant with major security standards: [[ISO/IEC 27001]], ISO/IEC 13335, [[ISO/IEC 15408]], [[ISO/IEC 17799]] and ISO/IEC 21287
** [[Standard of Good Practice]] developed by [[Information Security Forum]] (ISF)
** [[Mehari]] developed by [https://www.clusif.asso.fr/ Clusif Club de la Sécurité de l'Information Français]
** TIK IT Risk Framework developed by [http://itriskinstitute.com/ IT Risk Institute]
** Octave developed by Carnegie Mellon University, SEI ([[Software Engineering Institute]]) The Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability EvaluationSM (OCTAVE) approach defines a risk-based strategic assessment and planning technique for security.
** [[IT Baseline Protection Catalogs|IT-Grundschutz]] (IT Baseline Protection Manual) developed by Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) (Germany); IT-Grundschutz provides a method for an organization to establish an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It comprises both generic IT security recommendations for establishing an applicable IT security process and detailed technical recommendations to achieve the necessary IT security level for a specific domain
Enisa report&lt;ref name=ENISAFULL/&gt; classified the different methods regarding completeness, free availability, tool support; the result is that:
* EBIOS, ISF methods, IT-Grundschutz cover deeply all the aspects (Risk Identification, Risk analysis, Risk evaluation, Risk assessment, Risk treatment, Risk acceptance, Risk communication),
* EBIOS and IT-Grundschutz are the only ones freely available and
* only EBIOS has an open source tool to support it.

The [[Factor Analysis of Information Risk]] (FAIR) main document, "An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006;&lt;ref name=FAIR&gt;,[http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf "An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118061526/http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf |date=2014-11-18 }};&lt;/ref&gt;
outline that most of the methods above lack of rigorous definition of risk and its factors. FAIR is not another methodology to deal with risk management, but it complements existing methodologies.&lt;ref name=OGC081&gt;Technical Standard Risk Taxonomy {{ISBN|1-931624-77-1}} Document Number: C081 Published by The Open Group, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

FAIR has had a good acceptance, mainly by [[The Open Group]] and [[ISACA]].

ISACA developed a methodology, called [[Risk IT]], to address various kind of IT related risks, chiefly security related risks. It is integrated with [[COBIT]], a general framework to manage IT.
Risk IT has a broader concept of [[IT risk]] than other methodologies, it encompasses not just only the negative [[impact (security)|impact]] of operations and service delivery which can bring destruction or reduction of the value of the organization, but also the benefit\value enabling risk associated to missing opportunities to use technology to enable or enhance business or the IT project management for aspects like overspending or late delivery with adverse business impact.&lt;ref name=RISKITW/&gt;

The "''Build Security In''" initiative of [[Homeland Security Department]] of United States, cites FAIR.&lt;ref&gt;https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/bsi/articles/best-practices/deployment/583-BSI.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The initiative Build Security In is a collaborative effort that provides practices, tools, guidelines, rules, principles, and other resources that software developers, architects, and security practitioners can use to build security into software in every phase of its development. So it chiefly address [[Secure coding]].

In 2016, Threat Sketch launched an abbreviated cyber security risk assessment specifically for small organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hub.innovationquarter.com/2016/10/05/a-start-up-grows-up-in-the-innovation-quarter/|title=Threat Sketch: A Start-up Grows Up in the Innovation Quarter|date=2016-10-05|website=Innovation Quarter Hub|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.twcnews.com/nc/triad/news/2016/11/11/entrepreneurs-share-business-ideas-on-startup-weekend.html|title=Triad Entrepreneurs Share Business Ideas on Startup Weekend|newspaper=TWC News|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology uses [[Real options valuation|real options]] to forecast and prioritize a fixed list of high-level threats.

The '''Inter-Services Intelligence''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|بین الخدماتی مخابرات}}}}, abbreviated as '''ISI''') is the premier [[intelligence agency]] of [[Pakistan]], operationally responsible for gathering, processing, and analyzing [[national security]] information from around the world. As one of the principal members of the [[Pakistani intelligence community]], the ISI reports to the [[Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence|Director-General]] and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the [[Government of Pakistan]].

The ISI consists primarily of serving military officers drawn on [[secondment]] from the three service branches of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] ([[Pakistan Army|Army]], [[Pakistan Air Force|Air Force]], and [[Pakistan Navy|Navy]]) and hence the name "Inter-Services". However, the agency also recruits many civilians. Since 1971, the ISI has been headed by a serving [[Lieutenant-General|three-star general]] of the Pakistan Army, who is appointed by the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] on recommendation of the [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]], who recommends three officers for the job. The ISI is currently headed by Lieutenant-General [[Asim Munir (soldier)|Asim Munir]] who was appointed Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence on 1 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1301868|title=Lt Gen Asim Munir appointed as DG ISI|work=dawn.com|date=11 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Director-General reports directly to both the Prime Minister and the Army Chief.

The ISI gained global recognition and fame in the 1980s when it supported the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[Mujahideen#Afghanistan|Mujahideen]] against the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] in then [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. During the war, the ISI worked in close coordination with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] of the [[United States]] to train and fund the Mujahideen with American, Pakistani, and Saudi funds.

After fall of the Soviet Union, the ISI provided strategic support and intelligence to the Afghan Taliban against the [[Northern Alliance]] during the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] in Afghanistan of the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Sky"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matt Waldman |date=June 2010 |title=The Sun in the Sky: The Relationship between Pakistan's ISI and Afghan Insurgents |journal=Crisis States Working Papers |publisher=Crisis States Research Centre, [[London School of Economics]] and Political Science |issue=series no.2, no. 18 |page=3 |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/mritems/Documents/2010/6/13/20106138531279734lse-isi-taliban.pdf |quote=In the 1980s the ISI was instrumental in supporting seven Sunni Muslim mujahideen groups in their jihad against the Soviets and was the principal conduit of covert US and Saudi funding. It subsequently played a pivotal role in the emergence of the Taliban (Coll 2005:292) and Pakistan provided significant political, financial, military and logistical support to the former [[Taliban]] regime in [[Afghanistan]] (1996–2001)(Rashid 2001).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Inter-Services Intelligence was created in 1948 following 1947–48 Pakistan-India war which had exposed weaknesses in intelligence gathering, sharing, and coordination between the [[Pakistan Army|Army]], [[Pakistan Air Force|Air Force]], [[Pakistan Navy|Navy]], [[Intelligence Bureau (Pakistan)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB) and [[Military Intelligence of Pakistan|Military Intelligence]] (MI).&lt;ref name="ISI History 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/pakistan/isi.htm|title=Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515203133/https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/pakistan/isi.htm |archive-date=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISI was structured to be operated by officers from the three main military services, and to specialize in the collection, analysis, and assessment of external military and non-military intelligence.&lt;ref name="ISI History 1" /&gt; The ISI was the [[Idea|brainchild]] of the former [[British Indian Army]] Major General Sir [[Robert Cawthome]], then Deputy [[Chief of Staff|Deputy Chief of Staff]] of the Pakistan Army and selected Colonel Shahid Hamid to set up the agency. Initially, the ISI had no role in the collection of internal intelligence, with the exception of the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|NWFP]] and [[Azad Kashmir|Azad Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="ISI History 1" /&gt; The recruitment and expansion of the ISI was managed and undertaken by [[Pakistan Navy|Naval]] [[Commander]] [[Syed Mohammad Ahsan]], who was tenuring as Deputy Director of [[Naval Intelligence of Pakistan|Naval Intelligence]] and played a pivotal role in formulating the procedures of the ISI. Following the [[1958 Pakistani coup d'état|1958 coup d'état]], all national intelligence agencies came under the direct control of the President and Chief Martial Law Administrator. The maintenance of national security, which was the principal function of these agencies, came to mean the consolidation of the Ayub regime.

==Organization==
The ISI is headed by a Director-General, who is traditionally a serving Lieutenant-General (Three-star general) in the Pakistan Army.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Three Deputy Director-Generals, who are serving 2-star military officers, report directly to the Director-General with each deputy heading three wings respectively:&lt;ref&gt;Shuja Nawaz.

*'''Internal Wing''' – responsible for domestic intelligence, domestic [[counter-intelligence]], counter-espionage, and counter-terrorism.
*'''External Wing''' – responsible for external intelligence, external counter-intelligence, and espionage.
*'''Foreign Relations Wing''' – responsible for diplomatic intelligence and foreign relations intelligence.

The wing is particularly significant because the port at [[Gwadar]] is slated to be a linchpin for the major trade corridor linking northwestern China to the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claws.in/images/journals_doc/1425990525_BSPawar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The general staff of the ISI is composed of military officers of the armed forces as well as civilian officers from the [[Federal Investigation Agency|FIA]], [[Federal Board of Revenue (Pakistan)|FBR]], [[Pakistan Customs]], [[Law enforcement in Pakistan|police]] and [[Pakistani judiciary|judiciary]]. They are recruited on deputations for 3 to 4 years and enhance the ISI's professional competence. Experienced army officers who perform well are given repeated extensions in their service.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} According to some experts, the ISI is the largest intelligence agency in the world in terms of total staff. While the total number has never been made public, experts estimate around 10,000 officers and staff, which does not include informants or assets.&lt;ref name="FAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/pakistan/isi/ |title=Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |author=Pike, John |date=25 July 2002 |access-date=13 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515131913/http://www.fas.org/irp/world/pakistan/isi/ |archive-date=15 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Headquarters===
The ISI is headquartered in Pakistan's capital, [[Islamabad]]. The complex consists of various low-rise buildings separated by lawns and fountains. The entrance to the complex is next to a [[private hospital]]. Declan Walsh of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that the entrance is "suitably discreet: no sign, just a plainclothes officer packing a pistol who direct visitors through a chicane of barriers, soldiers and sniffer dogs".&lt;ref name="Walshreally"&gt;Walsh, Declan. "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/12/isi-bin-laden-death-pakistan-alqaida Whose side is Pakistan's ISI really on?]." ''[[The Guardian]]''. Thursday 12 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh said that the complex "resembles a well-funded private university" and that the buildings are "neatly tended," the lawns are "smooth," and the fountains are "tinkling." He described the central building, which houses the director general's office on the top floor, as "a modern structure with a round, echoing lobby."&lt;ref name="Walshreally" /&gt;

==Recruitment and training==
Both civilians and members of the armed forces can join the ISI. For civilians, recruitment is advertised and is jointly handled by the [[Federal Public Services Commission]] (FPSC) and civilian ISI agents are considered employees of the Ministry of Defence. The FPSC conducts various examinations testing the candidate's knowledge of current affairs, English and various analytical abilities. Based on the results, the FPSC shortlists the candidates and sends the list to the ISI who conduct the initial background checks. The selected candidates are then invited for an interview which is conducted by a joint committee comprising both ISI and FPSC officials, then the selected persons are sent to Defence Services intelligence Academy (DSIA) for 6 months of training. Later these officers are transferred to different sections for open source information where they serve for five years. Officers after five years of basic service are entrusted with sensitive jobs and declared the core team of ISI.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

: ISI is a very well-funded organisation. It employs a large number of different types of human resource which share information voluntarily or involuntarily. The ISI agents often build a very warm relationship with the subjects and take a long time to build trust.

The masterminds behind the coup were high-ranking Military and Intelligence officers and were led by Major General Tajammal Hussain Malik, his son, Captain Naveed and his nephew Major Riaz, a former Military Intelligence officer. ISI decided against arresting these men outright because they did not know how deep this conspiracy went and kept these men under strict surveillance. As the date of the annual parade approached, ISI was satisfied that it had identified the major players in this conspiracy and then arrested these men along with quite a few high-ranking military officers.&lt;ref name="Profiles of Intelligence" /&gt;

Gen. Joseph Anderson, a senior commander for US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, said in a Pentagon-hosted video briefing from Afghanistan that the Haqqani network is now "fractured" like the Taliban. "They are fractured. They are fractured like the Taliban is. That's based pretty much on the Pakistan's operations in North Waziristan this entire summer-fall," he said, acknowledging the effectiveness of Pakistan's [[Zarb-e-Azb|military offensive]] in North Waziristan. "That has very much disrupted their efforts in Afghanistan and has caused them to be less effective in terms of their ability to pull off an attack in Kabul," Anderson added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Operation Zarb-i-Azb disrupted Haqqani network: US general |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1142664/ |date=6 November 2014 |work=Dawn |accessdate=7 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TuAoKSCW?url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1142664/ |archivedate=7 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association of Lawyers against Nuclear Arms''' ('''IALANA''') is an [[international non-governmental organisation]] headquartered in [[Berlin]]. It was founded in 1988 and seeks "to build and strengthen international legal efforts to ban the use and threat of use of [[nuclear weapons]]."&lt;ref name="Diehl" /&gt; Its membership consists of individual lawyers and lawyer's organisations. The current President of the organisation is [[Christopher Weeramantry]], a former Judge of the [[International Court of Justice]]. The German section of the organisation was co-founded by former German Minister of Justice [[Herta Däubler-Gmelin]]. IALANA had a central role in the process that sought an advisory ruling on the legality of nuclear arms from the International Court of Justice.&lt;ref name="Diehl"&gt;Sarah J. Diehl, James Clay Moltz, ''Nuclear Weapons and Nonproliferation: A Reference Book'' (p. 277), 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation has consultative status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3745">The '''International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation''', also known as the '''Hague Code of Conduct (HCOC)''', was established on 25 November 2002 as an arrangement to prevent the proliferation of [[ballistic missile]]s.

The HCOC is the result of international efforts to regulate access to ballistic missiles which can potentially deliver [[weapons of mass destruction]]. The HCOC is the only multilateral code in the area of disarmament which has been adopted over the last years.  It is the only normative instrument to verify the spread of ballistic missiles. The HCOC does not ban ballistic missiles, but it does call for restraint in their production, testing, and export.

As agreed by the conference in The Hague, [[Austria]] serves as the Immediate Central Contact (Executive Secretariat) and therefore coordinates the information exchange of the HCOC. 

To create a link between the UN and the HCOC, which was not negotiated in the context of the UN, a Resolution regarding the HCOC was tabled in the course of the 59th as well as the 60th and 63rd sessions of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] in [[New York City]].

Since the HCOC's entry into force, sixteen Conferences of Subscribing States of the HCOC have been held. The 16th Regular Meeting of Subscribing States of the HCOC took place from 6–7 June 2017 under the chairmanship of Ambassador [[:pl:Marek_Szczygieł|Marek Szczygieł]] from [[Poland]].

India joined the HCOC on 1 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India Subscribes to The Hague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2016/06/257907.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India joins The Hague Code of Conduct|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-joins-the-hague-code-of-conduct/article8682678.ece|website=The Hindu|accessdate=26 June 2016|language=en-IN|date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Missile Technology Control Regime]] (MTCR) has a similar mission, it is an export group with only 35 members.

The '''Legislative Council''' was the legislature of [[British Guiana]] between 1928 and 1953 and again from 1954 until 1961.

==History==
The Legislative Council was created by constitutional reforms in 1928, which abolished the 22-member [[Combined Court]] and replaced it with the 30-member Council. The new Council included an extra eight appointees,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter105.html New constitution of 1928] Guyana.org&lt;/ref&gt; and consisted of the Governor, two ex-officio members, eight official members, five unofficial members and 14 members elected in single-member constituencies.&lt;ref name=P&gt;[http://parliament.gov.gy/GUYANA%20PARLIAMENT%20HISTORY%202009-1.pdf Historical information events and dates on the Parliament of Guyana from 1718 to 2006] Parliament of Guyana&lt;/ref&gt; The new council met for the first time on 28 November 1928.&lt;ref name=P/&gt; The first elections were held in [[British Guiana general election, 1930|1930]] and [[British Guiana general election, 1935|1935]].

Due to the outbreak of [[World War II]], elections did not happen again until 1947, with the Council elected in 1935 becoming known as the "Long Parliament". Constitutional amendments in 1943 saw the number of appointed members reduced from 16 to 11, giving the elected members a majority. The [[British Guiana general election, 1947|1947 elections]] were held under this system.

As a result of the [[Waddington Commission]], further constitutional reforms were enacted in 1952; universal suffrage was introduced and the Legislative Council was to be replaced by a [[House of Assembly (British Guiana)|House of Assembly]]. The term of the final Legislative Council was extended in order to allow preparations for [[British Guiana general election, 1953|elections]] under the new system on 27 April 1953. The Council was dissolved on 8 April 1953.&lt;ref name=P/&gt;

However, the constitution was suspended on 9 October 1953 and the House of Assembly was prorogued, before being dissolved on 21 December. A wholly appointed Interim Legislative Council was established and met for the first time on 5 January 1954. The Interim Legislative Council had 28 members, including the Speaker, three ex-officio members, four members with portfolio, three members without portfolio, two official members and 15 unofficial members,&lt;ref name=P/&gt; several of whom had previously been elected members.

The Interim Legislative Council remained in place until it was dissolved on 29 June 1957, after which [[British Guiana general election, 1957|elections]] for a new Legislative Council were held on 12 August. It consisted of the Speaker, three official members, six nominated members and 14 elected members.&lt;ref name=P/&gt;

A new constitution was promulgated in July 1961. It abolished the Legislative Council for a second time, replacing it with a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Legislature (British Guiana)|Legislature]] including a 13-member [[Senate (British Guiana)|Senate]] and a 36-member [[Legislative Assembly (British Guiana)|Legislative Assembly]]. [[British Guiana general election, 1961|Elections]] to the new Legislature were held on 21 August.

This '''list of suffragists and suffragettes''' includes noted individuals active in the worldwide [[women's suffrage]] movement who have campaigned or strongly advocated for women's suffrage, the [[List of suffragists and suffragettes#Major suffrage organizations|organizations]] which they formed or joined, and the [[List of suffragists and suffragettes#Women's suffrage publications|publications]] which publicized&amp;nbsp;– and, in some nations, continue to publicize&amp;nbsp;– their goals. [[Suffragist]]s and [[suffragette]]s, often members of different groups and societies, used or use differing tactics. For example, "suffragette" in the [[United Kingdom|British]] usage denotes a more "[[Militant (word)|militant]]" type of campaigner, while suffragettes in the United States organized such [[nonviolent]] events as the [[Suffrage Hikes]], the [[Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913|Woman Suffrage Procession of 1913]], and the [[Silent Sentinels]].

'''Morris Berthold Abram''' (June 19, 1918 – March 16, 2000) was an [[United States|American]] lawyer, civil rights activist, and for two years president of [[Brandeis University]].  In 1953 he successfully sought the Democratic nomination for Congress from the Fifth District in Georgia, urging the desegregation of schools but lost the election in 1954. He may be best remembered as a civil rights attorney who successfully waged a fourteen year struggle from 1949–63 to end a Georgia electoral rule that gave disproportionate weight in primary elections to vote counts in white rural areas at the expense of those cast by urban blacks. When the rule was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1963, he briefed Attorney General Robert Kennedy who argued the case.  

The Supreme Court found "within a given constituency there can be room for but one constitutional rule – one voter, one vote." 

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Abram was born into a [[Jews|Jewish]] family, the son of Sam Abram, a [[Romania|Romanian]] immigrant who came to America in 1904.  Morris Abrams' mother, Irene Cohen was born into a German Jewish family that first settled in Philadelphia in 1848.&lt;ref name=art&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/08/books/books-of-the-times-135183.html Morris Berthold Abram: New York Times Article]&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the small town of [[Fitzgerald, Georgia|Fitzgerald]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and attended the [[University of Georgia]], where he excelled academically. At UGA, he was a member of the [[Phi Kappa Literary Society]] and graduated according to one source with the highest grade-point average in the school's history. Abram then earned a law degree from the [[University of Chicago Law School]]. Although he was forced to forgo a [[Rhodes scholarship]] because of the [[Second World War]], he later earned a master's degree from [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandeis.edu/president/past/  brandeis university]: Past presidents page&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herskowitz"&gt;Herkowitz, Linda, ''The Philadelphia Enquirer'', Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg. 47, 14 August 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime service===
After graduation from the University of Chicago Law School, Abram served as an Army Air Corp Public Relations Officer in the second World War.

====Work at the Nuremberg trials and drafting the Fourth Geneva Convention====
While at Oxford, a professor arranged for Abram to join the staff of prosecutors at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.  Around 1949, he was involved in the drafting of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], a document which dealt primarily with humanitarian protections for civilians in a war zone.  He later received criticism primarily from Palestinian representatives for a statement he made during that period that did not focus on the plight of displaced Palestinians and the existence of Israeli settlements in what they deemed occupied territories during the first year of Israel's statehood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=1&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=378&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=5603&amp;TTL=The_Settlements_Issue:_Distorting_the_Geneva_Convention_and_the_Oslo_Accords The Settlements Issue: Distorting the Geneva Convention and the Oslo Accords ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work for Jewish causes and legal work on behalf of nursing homes===
Abram was deeply affected by the [[Holocaust]] and later became an ardent supporter of Jewish causes.

Before moving to New York, and while working in Georgia during his civil rights career, he negotiated the release of Dr. Martin Luther King from a Fulton County Georgia jail. &lt;ref name="Herskowitz"/&gt;

In 1975, Abram led the Moreland Act Commission, which investigated corruption in New York's nursing home industry. The commission's recommendations led to several changes, among them the closing of 68 nursing homes that failed to comply with existing fire-safety codes.

He was national president of the American Jewish Committee from 1963 to 1968; chairman of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry from 1983 to 1988; and chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations from 1986 to 1989.

==High level positions held==
In his long and distinguished legal career, Abram held a variety of high level positions.  In 1961 he was appointed by President Kennedy to chief counsel of the [[Peace Corps]].  He also worked as a partner at the New York law firm [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison]] from 1963–8. He then worked as President of Brandeis University from 1968–1970.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brandeis.edu/president/past/abram.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as chairman of the President Carter's Commission on the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research.  In New York, he chaired the Governor's Commission on Nursing Home Practices.&lt;ref&gt;Gralnick, William A., "Extraordinary Life Fits Morris Abram for a Seat on Federal Civil Rights Panel", Miami, Florida, pg. 11, 27 June 1983&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1983, he was nominated to the United States Commission on Civil Rights by Ronald Reagan.  By that time, he was a vocal opponent of affirmative action and busing which made him a fit for Reagan, but an instant opponent of many more liberal civil rights advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/17/us/morris-abram-is-dead-at-81-rights-advocate-led-brandeis.html|title=Morris Abram Is Dead at 81|publisher=''New York Times''|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1970 to 1979 he served as Chairman of the United Negro College Fund, an organization which raises money predominantly for Black colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/17/us/morris-abram-is-dead-at-81-rights-advocate-led-brandeis.html|title=Morris Abram Is Dead at 81|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work as representative to the UN European Office, 1989–93===
President [[George H. W. Bush]] appointed Abram as the [[Representative of the United States to the European Office of the United Nations]] and he served in that office from 1989–93.&lt;ref name="USUNEO"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/chiefsofmission/representative-uneo|title=Representatives of the U.S.A. to the European Office of the United Nations (Geneva)|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1990, he served as the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Council|US Representative to the UN Commission on Human Rights]]. He took criticism primarily for siding with America's solitary veto of the 1986 UN Resolution to the [[Right to development]] of countries, when he stated that the right to development was an "empty vessel" and would be "a dangerous incitement". America's veto of the resolution may have been related to the nature of their economic, political, and military involvement with developing countries particularly in Africa and the Middle East during the Reagan and George H.

While working for UN Watch, Abram noted in 1996 that Israel was the only country in the UN excluded from membership in a geopolitical grouping or states groups which made it ineligible to serve on the Security Council, the Human Rights commission, and a large number of other bodies.  These exclusions, Abrams believed "made it easier for Israel's enemies to proactively cultivate international hostility toward Israel at the General Assembly".  Abram pushed for Israel's membership in the Western European or other states groups as the "only reasonable way to remedy this ongoing illegal discrimination against Israel".  Abram was concerned during this period there were 19 United Nations resolutions that castigated Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Cynthia, "Israel at the United Nations: Two Steps Forward, One Back", ''St. Louis Jewish Light'', St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 2, 10 April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and surviving illness==
After being diagnosed with a thought-to-be-fatal form of leukemia in 1973 but overcoming it, Abram published a memoir in 1982 titled ''The Day is Short''.&lt;ref name=art/&gt; Into the late 70s he continued to battle leukemia with painful chemotherapy, a variety of anti-leukemia drugs, and injections of treated leukemic cells. Remarkably, he survived the illness and lived a vibrant life until dying of a viral infection on March 15, 2000 in [[Geneva]] at the age of 80.&lt;ref&gt;Gupte, Pranay, "There's Hope for Leukemia Patients", ''Tampa Bay Times'', St. Petersburg, Florida, pg. 38, 16 August 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= William|last= Honan|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Morris Abram is Dead at 81.

The '''No Self-Government Party''' was a minor [[Australian Capital Territory]] political party that experienced limited success in the early years of the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]]. Like [[Dennis Stevenson]]'s [[Abolish Self-Government Coalition]], it opposed [[Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988|self-government]] for the ACT. In the [[Australian Capital Territory legislative election, 1989|first territory election]] in 1989, three members of the No Self-Government Party were elected. None was still a member of the party by the 1992 election, by which time it had ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legassembly.act.gov.au/education/fact-sheets.asp?nav=factsheet02 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329130619/http://www.legassembly.act.gov.au/education/fact-sheets.asp?nav=factsheet02 |archivedate=2013-03-29 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Norwegian Police Service''' ({{lang-no|Politi- og lensmannsetaten}}) is the [[Norway|Norwegian]] civilian [[police]] agency. It consists of a central [[National Police Directorate (Norway)|National Police Directorate]], seven specialty agencies and [[list of police districts in Norway|twelve police districts]]. The [[government agency]] is subordinate to the [[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Ministry of Justice and Public Security]] and has 16,000 employees, of which 8,000 are [[police officer]]s. In addition to [[Police|police power]]s, the service is responsible for [[border guard|border control]], certain civil duties, coordinating [[search and rescue]] operations, [[counter-terrorism]], [[highway patrol]]ling, [[writ of execution]], [[criminal investigation]] and [[prosecution]].

The police service dates to the 13th century when the first [[lensmann|sheriffs]] were appointed. As the first city in Norway to do so, [[Trondheim]] had a [[chief of police]] appointed in 1686, and [[Oslo]] established a uniformed police corps in 1859. The directorate is led by National Police Commissioner [[Odd Reidar Humlegård]]. Police districts were introduced in 1894, with the current structure dating from 2003.

Each police district is led by a chief of police and is subdivided into several [[police station]]s in towns and cities, and sheriffs' offices for rural areas. The [[Governor of Svalbard]] acts as chief of police for [[Svalbard]]. Norwegian police officers do not carry [[firearm]]s, but keep their [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]] submachine guns and [[Heckler &amp; Koch P30]] pistols locked down in the patrol cars. The [[Norwegian Prosecuting Authority]] is partially integrated with the police.

Specialist agencies within the services include the [[National Criminal Investigation Service (Norway)|National Criminal Investigation Service]], the [[National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime in Norway|National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]] (Økokrim), the [[National Police Immigration Service (Norway)|National Police Immigration Service]], the [[National Mobile Police Service (Norway)|National Mobile Police Service]], the [[Norwegian Border Commissioner]], the [[National Police Computing and Material Service (Norway)|National Police Computing and Material Service]] and the [[Norwegian Police University College]]. Several other national responsibilities are under the command of [[Oslo Police District]], such as the [[Emergency Response Unit (Norway)|Emergency Response Unit]] and the two [[police helicopter]]s. The [[Norwegian Police Security Service|Police Security Service]] is separate from the National Police Directorate.

==History==
{{main|History of the Norwegian Police Service}}
The police force in Norway was established during the 13th century. Originally the 60 to 80 sheriffs (''[[lensmann]]'')  were predominantly used for writ of execution and to a less degree police power. In the cities the duties were originally taken care of by a ''gjaldker''. The sheriffs were originally subordinate to the ''[[sysselmann]]'', but from the 14th century they instead became subordinate to the [[bailiff]] (''fogd'') and the number of sheriffs increased. In the cities the police authority was transferred directly to the bailiff. By the mid-17th century there were between 300 and 350 sheriffs. With the introduction of the [[absolute monarchy]] in 1660 and subsequent strengthening of the civil service, the importance of the police increased. The bailiffs as such became part of the police structure, with their superiors, the [[county governor (Norway)|county governor]], receiving a similar role as that of chief of police. The first titled chief of police was hired in [[Trondheim]] in 1686, thus creating the first police district, although his jurisdiction only covered the city proper. Chiefs of police were hired in [[Bergen]] in 1692, [[Oslo|Christiania]] (Oslo) in 1744 and [[Christianssand]] in 1776.&lt;ref name=history1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/stmeld/20002001/stmeld-nr-22-2000-2001-/3/8.html?id=431929 |title=Politireform 2000 Et tryggere samfunn |chapter=3.8 Historikk |date=12 January 2001 |publisher=[[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Ministry of Justice and the Police]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archivedate=17 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69ziJdvGz |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Police constables Norway 1908.jpg|thumb|left|Norwegian police constables in 1908]]
From the 19th century, deputies were hired in larger areas to assist the sheriffs. Following the [[Norway in 1814|democratization in 1814]], the Ministry of Justice was created in 1818 and has since had the primary responsibility for organizing the police force. The 19th century saw a large increase in the number of chiefs of police, reaching sixteen by the middle of the century. Christiania established the country's first uniformed corps of constables in 1859, which gave the force a more unified appearance. Similar structures were soon introduced in many other cities. From 1859 the [[municipalities of Norway|municipalities]] would finance the wages of the deputies and constables, which made it difficult for the police to use those forces outside the municipal borders.&lt;ref name=history1 /&gt; The first organized education of police officers started in Christiania in 1889.&lt;ref name=phshist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phs.no/no/Om-PHS/Fakta-og-tal/PHS-sin-historie/ |title=Historie |publisher=[[Norwegian Police University College]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=9 November 2010 |archivedate=9 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109012337/http://www.phs.no/no/Om-PHS/Fakta-og-tal/PHS-sin-historie/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894 the authorities decided to abolish the position of bailiff and it was decided that some of its tasks would be transferred to the sheriffs. This resulted in 26 new chief of police positions, largely corresponding to the old [[bailiwick]]s. Some received jurisdiction over both cities and rural areas, other just rural areas. At the same time the existing police districts were expanded to include the surrounding rural areas. However, the individual bailiff were not removed from office until their natural retirement, leaving some bailiwick in place until 1919. The reform eliminated the difference between the rural and city police forces; yet the sheriffs were only subordinate to the chief of police in police matters—in civil matters and administration they remained under the county governors.&lt;ref name=history1 /&gt;

The number of police districts was nearly constant from 1894 to 2002, although a few have been creased and closed.&lt;ref name=history1 /&gt; However, the organization in the various police districts varied considerably, especially in the cities. In particular, some cities had their civilian responsibilities taken care of by the municipality.

The [[Norwegian Border Commissioner]] is located in [[Kirkenes]] and is responsible for managing the [[Norway–Russia border]] and upholding the border agreement. Special consideration is needed as it is the only non-[[Schengen Area]] land border of Norway. Border controls are the responsibility of the respective police district. The [[National Police Computing and Material Service (Norway)|National Police Computing and Material Service]] is responsible for managing the police's [[information and communications technology]], [[procurement]], security and real estate.&lt;ref&gt;National Police Directorate (2010): 18&lt;/ref&gt; Norway has two [[joint rescue coordination center]]s, [[Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway|one for Northern Norway]] located in Bodø and on [[Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway|one for Southern Norway]] located in [[Sola]].

Metropolitan Norway is divided into [[list of police districts in Norway|27 police districts]]. Each district is further subdivided into local police stations and rural police districts, the latter led by a sheriff. Each police district is headquartered at a main police station and is led by a [[chief of police]]. Police districts hold a common pool of resources and personnel and have a common administration and budget. Each also has a joint operations center which also acts as an [[emergency call]] center for [[112 (emergency telephone number)|112]]. Many of the larger districts have their own execution and enforcement authority, while this in integrated in the smaller districts.&lt;ref&gt;National Police Directorate (2010): 8&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the police districts varies, from Oslo with 2,500 employees and covering a population of 570,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politi.no/oslo/om_oss/ |title=Om Oslo politidistrikt |publisher=Norwegian Police Service |accessdate=16 August 2012 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Eastern Finnmark Police District|Eastern Finnmark]] which has 160 employees and 30,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politi.no/ostfinnmark/om_oss/ |title=Om Østfinnmark politidistrikt |publisher=Norwegian Police Service |accessdate=16 August 2012 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oslo Police District has a series of special divisions and task forces which provide aid to all other police districts when necessary. It is responsible for the two police helicopters, which is mostly used for traffic motoring, search and rescue and apprehension.&lt;ref name="National Police Directorate 2010"/&gt; The [[Emergency Response Unit (Norway)|Emergency Response Unit]] is a deployment unit for [[terrorism]], [[sabotage]] and [[hostage]] incidents, which is separate from the crisis and hostage negotiation service.

Svalbard is not part of the regular police districts—instead it law enforcement it handled by the Governor of Svalbard. He holds the responsibility as both county governor and chief of police, as well as holding other authority granted from the executive branch. Duties include [[environmental policy]], [[family law]], law enforcement, search and rescue, tourism management, information services, contact with foreign settlements, and abjudication in some areas of maritime inquiries and judicial examinations—albeit never in the same cases as acting as police.&lt;ref name=admin&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/jd/Documents-and-publications/Reports-to-the-Storting-White-Papers/Reports-to-the-Storting/19992000/report-no-9-to-the-storting-/5-The-administration-of-Svalbard.html?id=456897 |title=Report No. 9 to the Storting (1999-2000): Svalbard  |publisher=[[Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police]] |chapter=The administration of Svalbard |date=29 October 1999 |archivedate=19 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67382yAd1 |deadurl=no |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Mayen]] is subordinate to Salten Police District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/in/xd-19620601-3341.html |title=FOR 1962-06-01 nr 3341: Instruks for sjefen for den militære stasjon på Jan Mayen for så vidt angår fremmedkontroll og fiskerioppsyn. |publisher=[[Lovdata]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=18 August 2012 |archivedate=18 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A0jLvJhK |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdiction and capabilities==
[[File:Fartskontroll.jpg|thumb|The [[National Mobile Police Service (Norway)|National Mobile Police Service]] performing a traffic control on [[European route E18|E18]]]]
Norway has a unified police, which means that there is a single police organization and that [[Police|police power]] and [[prosecutor]] power is not granted to other agencies within Norway.&lt;ref name=grunnprinsipper&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/stmeld/20042005/stmeld-nr-42-2004-2005-/2.html?id=199244 |title=Politiets rolle og oppgaver |chapter=2 Grunnprinsipper for norsk politi |date=24 June 2005 |publisher=[[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Ministry of Justice and the Police]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archivedate=17 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69zXc1pGV |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sole exception is the [[military police]], albeit which only has jurisdiction over military personnel and on military installations, except during [[martial law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19880520-033-0.html |title=Lov om politimyndighet i det militære forsvar. |publisher=[[Lovdata]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archivedate=17 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69zZE2B01 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police are decentralized and generalized to allow a more flexible resource allocation, while remaining under political control.

Conversely, the police can ask for assistance from the [[Norwegian Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] when necessary. The police are responsible for all responses against terrorism and sabotage unless Norway is under [[war|armed attack]].&lt;ref name=oppgaver /&gt;

Responsibilities and functions related to security includes patrolling, continual emergency availability, highway patrolling, [[water police|sea patrolling]], coordination of search and rescue activities, embassy security and as a [[body guard]] service for members of the government, the royal family and other in need. The crime fighting responsibility is split between preventative measures, such as information, observation and controls, and consequential measures, such as investigation and prosecution. The police further have duties related to civilian court cases, such as writ of execution, evaluation of natural damage, assisting the courts after [[bankruptcies]] and functioning as a [[notary public]].&lt;ref name=oppgaver /&gt;

[[File:OSLpass.JPG|thumb|left|[[Romerike Police District]] is responsible for the passport control at [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen]]]]
The police have a series of functions related to public management, such as the issuing of [[Norwegian passport|passports]], [[firearms license]]s, [[police certificate]]s, permissions for lotteries and withdrawal of [[driving license]]s, approval of [[security guard]] companies and [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]],  recommendations to municipal councils for issuing alcohol sales licenses, approval of [[second-hand shop]]s and arrangements which are otherwise unlawful, dealing with unowned dogs and animals in the care of people sentenced unsuitable to hold animals.&lt;ref name=oppgaver /&gt;

The police also have the responsibility for [[prisoner transport]] during [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]], including transport to and from court. The police serve as [[border guard]]s for the outer border of the [[Schengen Area]]. The busiest are [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen]], which has 130 man-years tied to it, [[Storskog]] on the Russian border and [[Sandefjord Airport, Torp]]. These are the only borders with designated border employees—all other are manned with regular officers. The police is not responsible for [[customs]], which is the responsibility of the [[Norwegian Customs and Excise Authorities]]. Norway participates in a series of international police cooperation, such as [[Interpol]], [[Europol]], the [[Schengen Information System]], [[Frontex]], and the [[Baltic Sea Task Force on Organized Crime]]. Norway also has a close cooperation with the other Nordic police forces. The Norwegian Police Service occasionally participates in international operations.&lt;ref name=oppgaver /&gt;

In 2011 the police force had 746,464 assignments, the most common with 180,000 assignments being investigation cases, such as reported deaths, controls and reports of [[motor vehicle theft]]. This was followed by traffic assignments, public [[Breach of the peace|disturbance of peace]], animal cases, theft, private disturbance of peace, and sickness and psychiatry. Seventy-five percent of assignments are solved with a single patrol, while ninety percent are solved with one and two. In armed situations only twenty percent are solved with a single patrol.&lt;ref name=foss&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/En-av-to-politifolk-far-ikke-lov-til-a-rykke-ut-6978973.html |title=En av to politifolk får ikke lov til å rykke ut |last=Foss |first=Andreas Bakke |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=31 August 2012 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 August 2012 |archivedate=31 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AL25Sdeh |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the Norwegian Police Service had 13 billion [[Norwegian krone]] in costs, of which seventy percent was used on wages.

There were 5,399 debt settlements, 226,491 applications for writ of execution, 195,345 immigration cases and 4,615 forced returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/03/05/politi_statres_en/ |title=Politiet som del av påtalemyndigheten |publisher=[[Statistics Norway]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archivedate=17 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69z91uJE2 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and prosecution==
[[File:Police officers securing DNA.jpg|thumb|A police officer demonstrates securing [[DNA evidence]].]]
The [[Norwegian Prosecuting Authority]] is integrated into the Norwegian Police Service. The authority is divided into a higher and lower authority, with the higher authority (public prosecutor) being a separate government agency and the lower authority (police prosecutor) being members of the police. The latter includes chief of police, deputy chief of police, police prosecutors and deputy police prosecutors. In questions of prosecution the police districts are subordinate to the Norwegian Prosecuting Authority and in other matters subordinate to the National Police Directorate.&lt;ref name=oppgaver /&gt;

The higher authorities will take decisions in serious criminal charges and for appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politi.no/om_politiet/rettsvesenet_i_norge/politiets_del_av_patalemyndigheten/ |title=Police and prosecution – StatRes |publisher=Norwegian Police Service |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archivedate=17 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69zgXgOn9 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian Persecuting Authority is led by the Director General of Public Prosecutions,&lt;ref name=prosecution&gt;National Police Directorate (2010): 29&lt;/ref&gt; which since 1997 has been [[Tor-Aksel Busch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/06/21/nyheter/innenriks/terror/anders_behring_breivik/breivik/22225547/ |title=– Hun bør bli vår neste riksadvokat |last=Foss |first=Andreas Bakke |work=[[Dagbladet]] |date=22 June 2012 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=2 September 2012 |archivedate=2 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ANUxILQT|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director general makes decisions of [[indictment]] in cases with a maximum penalty of twenty-one years and certain other serious crimes.&lt;ref name=prosecution /&gt; There are twelve subordinate agencies, ten regional and two supporting Kripos and Økokrim, respectively.

If an offense is filed, the issue may be investigated by police on duty. Permission for [[search and seizure]] is issued by the police prosecutor on duty at the police district. Apprehended people are permitted a free [[defense counsel]] at the public's expense. If the police wish to keep apprehended people in [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]], the issue is brought to the relevant [[district court (Norway)|district court]], a process which may be repeated several times if the custody needs to be extended. Investigations are led by a police prosecutor. During investigation, the case may be concluded as a non-criminal offense, dismissed, or transferred to another police district. Minor cases with a positive finding may be resolved by police penalty notice, settlement by a conflict resolution board and withdrawal of prosecution.&lt;ref name=procedure&gt;National Police Directorate (2010): 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal cases with an assumed perpetrator are sent to the public prosecutor, who will consider issuing an indictment. If positive, the trial will take place at a district court, with a police prosecutor presiding over the case.&lt;ref name=procedure /&gt; Cases with more than six years maximum penalty will normally be carried out with public prosecutors prosecuting.&lt;ref name=prosecution /&gt; Either party can, on specified terms, appeal the outcome of the case to the [[court of appeal (Norway)|court of appeal]] and ultimately the [[Supreme Court of Norway]].&lt;ref name="procedure"/&gt;

==Education and employment==


Education of police officers is the responsibility of the [[Norwegian Police University College]], which is subordinate to the National Police Directorate. The main campus is located at [[Majorstuen]] in Oslo, while the secondary campus is located at [[Mørkved]] in Bodø.

At the time of graduation all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main reason is that the police districts see it as a waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.&lt;ref name=foss /&gt;

Each police district may dictate that operational personnel have a higher amount of training, for instance 80 hours is required in Oslo. Officers are certified at five levels, of which the top four can use firearms. Level three consists of a call-out unit for each police district, consisting of a combined 646 people. This requires 103 hours of special training per year. Higher levels are required for body-guard service (55 officers) and the Emergency Response Union (73 officers). All certification curriculum is developed by and organized by the university college.&lt;ref name=foss /&gt;

"'''Official Secrets Act'''" is a term used in [[Hong Kong]], [[India]],  [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and the [[United Kingdom]], and formerly in [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] for legislation that provides for the protection of state secrets and official information, mainly related to national security.

People working with [[Information sensitivity|sensitive information]] are commonly required to sign a statement to the effect that they agree to abide by the restrictions of the Official Secrets Act.  This is popularly referred to as "signing the Official Secrets Act". Signing this has no effect on which actions are legal, as the act is a [[law]], not a [[contract]], and individuals are bound by it whether or not they have signed it. Signing it is intended more as a reminder to the person that they are under such obligations. To this end, it is common to sign this statement both before and after a period of employment that involves access to secrets (e.g. [[MI5]]/[[MI6]]).

====Other legislation====
In addition to the Official Secrets Acts, the [[Naval Discipline Act 1957]] made it an offence punishable with [[life imprisonment]] to spy on-board [[Royal Navy]] ships or overseas bases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;Year=1957&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1292014&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1292225&amp;filesize=2764 Naval Discipline Act 1957 (c. 53), Part III Provisions relating to civilians and civil authorities, Section 93]. Accessed 15 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a capital offence until 1981.

===Canada===
*The (UK) [[Official Secrets Act 1889]] (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. 52) was adopted in Canada with minor modifications in 1890. Its provisions became part of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] in 1892. 
*The [[Official Secrets Act (Canada) 1939]] replaced the Criminal Code provisions and utilised the provisions of The Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1920 (UK). Amendments were made in 1950, 1967, 1970 and 1973.
*The [[Official Secrets Act (Canada) 1981]] was the final version of the law adopted by the House of Commons.
*In 2001, the Official Act was repealed and replaced by the [[Security of Information Act]]. 
22 prosecutions occurred under the Official Secrets Act in Canada, over half of which were in relation to the [[Gouzenko Affair]]. In 1989, [[Stephen Joseph Ratkai]] was charged and convicted under the Act, of espionage in relation to the [[SOSUS]] network site at [[Naval Station Argentia]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].

===Hong Kong===
*The [[Official Secrets Ordinance|Official Secrets Ordinance 1997]] (27 June 1997,  L.N. 369 of 1997, Originally c. 62 of 1997)

===Malaysia===
* [[Official Secrets Act 1972]], Malaysia

==Official Secrets Acts in other countries==
The phrase ''official secrets act'' may also be used to refer to statutes of a similar nature in other countries.  [[Canada]]'s ''Official Secrets Act'' was replaced in 2001 by similar legislation titled the ''[[Security of Information Act]]'' (which was created in the wake of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th 2001]] to replace the vaguely worded Official Secrets Act&lt;ref&gt;Don Butler, [http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=2504f6b0-4ba0-4441-82bb-56dd1c784bd8&amp;k=48585 "Judge quashes law, warrants authorizing RCMP raid on Citizen reporter"], ''[[The Province]]'', October 19, 2006. Accessed 15 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The [[United States]] does not have a broad-reaching Official Secrets Act, although the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] has similar components. Much of the Espionage Act remains in force, although some has been struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] because of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (See ''[[United States v. The Progressive]]'', ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]''). {{usc|18|798}}, enacted in 1951, makes dissemination of secret information involving cryptography, espionage, and surveillance illegal for all people, and is thus an "official secrets act" limited to those subjects.

In the [[Republic of Ireland]] the [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1963/en/act/pub/0001/index.html Official Secrets Act, 1963] repealed previous [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] legislation of 1911 and 1920. The Official Secrets Act, as amended, applies to all [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|civil servants]] and potentially anyone within the state. A suit may only be instigated at the approval of the [[Attorney General of Ireland]], additionally proceedings may occur [[in camera]] but the verdict and any sentence must occur in public.

[[Malaysia]] has an [[Official Secrets Act (Malaysia)|Official Secrets Act]] (also referred to as the OSA) prohibiting the collection, possession or distribution of information marked as an official secret—an action which can be made by any public officer. The certification of a document as an official secret is not subject to [[judicial review]], and a violation of the act is punishable with between one and seven years' imprisonment. The act has been controversial for its use to silence dissent and stifling anti-corruption activities.&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Puah, [http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-n/2006/09/osa-stays-says-nazri.htm "OSA stays, says Nazri"], ''[[Malaysia Today]]'', September 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]] has Part VII of the [[Crimes Act 1914]] (Commonwealth), entitled ''Official Secrets and Unlawful Soundings''.

'''Oratorical Interpretation''' (often shortened to Oral Interp, Oratorical Interp, Oratorical, or abbreviated to OI) is an event in American competitive high school forensics. In 2015 the category was officially renamed to Declamation. Similar to [[Original Oratory]], Oratorical differs in that the speeches performed must be published material, not original material. The speeches given are speeches originally delivered in a public forum. Examples include the Inaugural Address of [[John F. Kennedy]], "I Have a Dream" by [[Martin Luther King]], and any college graduation speech. In a typical round of competition, five to seven competitors will declaim speeches before a judge. After the round, the judge will rank them from best to worst, and assign each competitor a score, which will be used to break ties when the tournament is tabulated.

Like [[Duet Acting]], Oratorical is not a [[National Forensic League]]-sanctioned event. It is practiced by other speech leagues, including the [[Ohio High School Speech League|OHSSL]], NCFCA, [[NCFL]], [[ and [[California High School Speech Association]].

'''Peter Ritchie Calder, Baron Ritchie-Calder''' (1 July 1906 &amp;ndash; 31 January 1982) was a Scottish socialist author, journalist and academic. 

==Early life==
Peter Ritchie Calder was born on 1 July 1906 in [[Forfar]], [[Angus, Scotland]].

==Career==
Calder first worked as a [[journalist]] in [[Dundee]] and [[Glasgow]], where he became noted as a [[socialism|socialist]] and [[peace activist]]; as Science Editor of the ''[[News Chronicle]]'', he wrote under the name of 'Ritchie Calder'. 

After moving to [[London]] before [[World War II]], he accepted an appointment as the Director of Plans and Campaigns at the [[Political Warfare Executive]] branch of the Government, which was responsible for the allied war [[propaganda]] effort. He wrote propaganda posters and leaflets and speeches for allied leaders. He was a member of the [[1941 Committee]], a group of [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[politician]]s, writers and other people of influence in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1941 he became popular with his book ''Carry on London'', which described the effects of the German bombardment of London, [[Coventry]] and other cities in [[Great Britain]].

After the war Calder returned to his former activities as a writer and specialised in [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], the [[peace]] movement and in the [[public understanding of science]]. He worked also with the [[United Nations]] and was President of the [[National Peace Council]] and of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]. He also worked for the ''News Chronicle'' newspaper as Science Editor. 

Sir [[Lawrence Bragg]]'s original announcement of the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]] was made at a [[Solvay conference]] on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953 but went unreported by the UK press.  He then gave a talk at [[Guy's Hospital Medical School]] in London on Thursday 14 May 1953, which resulted in an article by Ritchie Calder in the ''News Chronicle'' of London on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled "Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life". 

Calder was an ardent peace activist and [[humanist]]. In 1955, Calder recorded and released an album on [[Folkways Records]] entitled, ''Science in Our Lives.''  In 1980 he was one of the signatories of [[A Secular Humanist Declaration]], a statement of belief in [[democracy|Democratic]] [[Secular Humanism]], issued by the Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism ("CODESH"), now the [[Council for Secular Humanism]] ("CSH"). He was also one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also taught [[International Relations]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], from 1961 to 1967. He was created a life peer as '''Baron Ritchie-Calder''', of Balmashanner in the Royal Burgh of [[Forfar]] on 5 July 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=44048 |date=8 July 1966 |page=7719}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received the 1960 [[Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science|Kalinga prize]].

==Personal life==
Lord Ritchie-Calder and his wife Mabel Jane Forbes McKail had five children: [[science writer]] [[Nigel Calder]] (1931-2014); writer and [[historian]] [[Angus Calder]] (1942-2008); mathematician Allan Calder; educationist Isla Calder (1946-2000) and teacher Fiona Rudd (née Calder).  He was also the grandfather of travel writer [[Simon Calder]] and the actor, writer and comedienne Gowan Calder.

==Death==
Calder died on 31 January 1982, [[Edinburgh]], Scotland.

A small number of countries possess police forces (national or sub-national) which do not carry firearms on regular patrol or reserve firearms for specialist police officers.

==Use of firearms by country==
{{main|Police firearm use by country}}
===Iceland===
Icelandic policemen generally do not carry firearms, instead they carry [[telescopic baton]]s and [[pepper spray]].

===Republic of Ireland===
All routinely uniformed officers are unarmed. The strength of the [[Garda Síochána]] is approximately 15,000 officers, of which approx. 4,000 are licensed to carry firearms. Uniformed Gardaí wear stab-proof body armour and carry expandable ASP batons, handcuffs and pepper spray all introduced by the new Garda Inspectorate.

Armed support units include the [[Garda Regional Support Unit|Regional Support Units]] (RSU) and the national [[Garda Emergency Response Unit|Emergency Response Unit]] (ERU), which is comparable to American SWAT or British SCO19 and operates a variety of lethal and non-lethal devices. All Gardaí (Police Officers) who train as detectives carry a sidearm, and many plainclothes/undercover officers are also trained and deployed with the use of concealed handguns. 

The policy of unarmed police has been in place since 1922, when the Garda's armed predecessor, the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], was replaced upon the [[Irish Free State]]'s secession from the United Kingdom.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand police officers do not normally carry firearms, although access to firearms is available when circumstances dictate. Specialised units of the New Zealand Police such as the [[Armed Offenders Squad]], a [[SWAT]] type unit and the [[Special Tactics Group]] are also operational for different scenarios that might arise.

===Norway===
Norwegian police were generally not armed until November 25, 2014. Since then, officers with weapon training have been generally armed with loaded firearms, following the increased threat from IS.{{clarify|date=June 2018}} The temporary measure has been extended four times, the latest at July 29, 2015.&lt;ref name=VG&gt;''Justisdepartementet sier ja til fortsatt bevæpning: [http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/politi-hverdagen/justisdepartementet-sier-ja-til-fortsatt-bevaepning/a/23496883/]'' retrieved July 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Police use of firearms in the United Kingdom}}
The majority of British police are never routinely armed,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19641398]&lt;/ref&gt; relying on an extendable [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton]] and in some cases [[Taser]]s, with specialist armed units called in when necessary. The exceptions are the [[Ministry of Defence Police]], the [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]] and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]].

The '''property ladder''' is a term widely used in the United Kingdom to describe the relative differences in constant terms from cheaper to more expensive housing. 

According to this metaphor, an individual or family's lifetime progress can be traveled equally from cheap [[house]]s for younger [[First time buyer|first-time buyers]] who  are typically at the bottom of the property ladder, and expensive houses are at the top.  'Getting on to the property ladder' is the process of buying one's first house and holding a place on the [[Volatility (finance)|volatile]] property market.

'''Pumped-storage hydroelectricity''' ('''PSH'''), or '''pumped hydroelectric energy storage''' ('''PHES'''), is a type of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[energy storage]] used by [[electric power system]]s for [[load balancing (electrical power)|load balancing]].  The method stores energy in the form of [[gravitational potential energy]] of water, pumped from a lower elevation [[reservoir]] to a higher elevation. Low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps. During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through [[water turbine|turbine]]s to produce electric power. Although the losses of the pumping process makes the plant a net consumer of energy overall, the system increases [[revenue]] by selling more electricity during periods of ''[[peak demand]]'', when electricity prices are highest.

Pumped-storage hydroelectricity allows energy from intermittent sources (such as [[solar_power|solar]], [[Wind_power|wind]]) and other renewables, or excess electricity from continuous base-load sources (such as coal or nuclear) to be saved for periods of higher demand.&lt;ref&gt;http://poppware.de/Storage_for_a_secure_Power_Supply_from_Wind_and_Sun.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271539381_Pumped_hydro_energy_storage_system_A_technological_review|title=Pumped hydro energy storage system: A technological review|first1=Shafiqur|last1=Rehman|first2=Luai|last2=Al-Hadhrami|first3=Md|last3=Alam|date=30 April 2015|publisher=|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=44|via=ResearchGate|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2014.12.040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reservoirs used with pumped storage are quite small when compared to conventional hydroelectric dams of similar power capacity, and generating periods are often less than half a day.

Pumped storage is the largest-capacity form of [[grid energy storage]] available, and, as of 2017, the [[United States Department of Energy Global Energy Storage Database]] reports that PSH accounts for over 95% of all active tracked storage installations worldwide, with a total installed nameplate capacity of over 184 [[Gigawatt|GW]], of which about 25 GW are in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOE Global Energy Storage Database|url=http://www.energystorageexchange.org/|website=www.energystorageexchange.org|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''round-trip'' [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of PSH varies between 70%&amp;ndash;80%,&lt;ref name=EconomistPSH&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21548495?frsc=dg%7Ca|title=Energy storage - Packing some power|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2011-03-03|accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thier&gt;Jacob, Thierry.[http://www.stucky.ch/en/contenu/pdf/Pumped_storage_in_Switzerland_Dr_Jacob.pdf Pumped storage in Switzerland - an outlook beyond 2000] ''Stucky''.

Suitable sites are therefore likely to be in hilly or mountainous regions, and potentially in areas of outstanding natural beauty, and therefore there are also social and ecological issues to overcome. Many recently proposed projects, at least in the U.S., avoid highly sensitive or scenic areas, and some propose to take advantage of "brownfield" locations such as disused mines. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201202/20120208ATT37544/20120208ATT37544EN.pdf European Renewable Energy Network] pp. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
===Basic principle===
[[File:Pumpspeicherkraftwerk engl.png|thumb|left|Power distribution, over a day, of a pumped-storage hydroelectricity facility. Green represents power consumed in pumping; red is power generated.]]

At times of low electrical demand, excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the upper reservoir. When there is higher demand, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a [[turbine]], generating electricity. Reversible turbine/generator assemblies act as a combined pump and turbine generator unit (usually a [[Francis turbine]] design).

===Types: natural or man-made reservoirs===
In open-loop systems, pure pumped-storage plants store water in an upper reservoir with no natural inflows, while pump-back plants utilize a combination of pumped storage and conventional [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plants]] with an upper reservoir that is replenished in part by natural inflows from a stream or river. Plants that do not use pumped-storage are referred to as conventional hydroelectric plants; conventional hydroelectric plants that have significant storage capacity may be able to play a similar role in the [[Electric power transmission|electrical grid]] as pumped storage by deferring output until needed.

===Economic efficiency===
Taking into account evaporation losses from the exposed water surface and conversion losses, [[energy recovery]] of 70-80% or more can be regained.&lt;ref name="ESA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pumped Hydroelectric Storage {{!}} Energy Storage Association |url= http://energystorage.org/energy-storage/technologies/pumped-hydroelectric-storage/ |website=energystorage.org |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is currently the most cost-effective means of storing large amounts of electrical energy, but capital costs and the presence of appropriate geography are critical decision factors in selecting pumped-storage plant sites.

The relatively low energy density of pumped storage systems requires either large flows and/or large differences in height between reservoirs. The only way to store a significant amount of energy is by having a large body of water located relatively near, but as high above as possible, a second body of water. In some places this occurs naturally, in others one or both bodies of water were man-made. Projects in which both reservoirs are artificial and in which no natural inflows are involved with either reservoir are referred to as "closed loop" systems.&lt;ref name="ferc-psp-def"&gt;{{cite web |title=FERC: Hydropower - Pumped Storage Projects |url= https://www.ferc.gov/industries/hydropower/gen-info/licensing/pump-storage.asp|website=www.ferc.gov |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These systems may be economical because they flatten out load variations on the power grid, permitting thermal power stations such as [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired plant]]s and [[nuclear power plant]]s that provide base-load electricity to continue operating at peak efficiency, while reducing the need for "peaking" power plants that use the same fuels as many base-load thermal plants, gas and oil, but have been designed for flexibility rather than maximal efficiency. Hence pumped storage systems are crucial when [[unit commitment problem in electrical power production|coordinating large groups of heterogeneous generators]]. Capital costs for pumped-storage plants are relatively high, although this is somewhat mitigated by their long service life of up to 75 years or more, which is three to five times longer than utility-scale batteries.

Along with energy management, pumped storage systems help control electrical network [[frequency]] and provide reserve generation. Thermal plants are much less able to respond to sudden changes in electrical demand, potentially causing frequency and [[voltage]] instability. Pumped storage plants, like other hydroelectric plants, can respond to load changes within seconds.

The most important use for pumped storage has traditionally been to balance baseload powerplants,&lt;!--diurnal--&gt; but may also be used to [[Load following power plant|abate]] the fluctuating output of [[intermittent energy source]]s.&lt;!--week/month--&gt; Pumped storage provides a load at times of high electricity output and low electricity demand, enabling additional system peak capacity. In certain jurisdictions, [[Electricity market|electricity prices]] may be close to zero or occasionally negative on occasions that there is more electrical generation available than there is load available to absorb it; although at present this is rarely due to [[Wind power|wind]] or [[Solar power|solar]] power alone, increased wind and solar generation will increase the likelihood of such occurrences. It is particularly likely that pumped storage will become especially important as a balance for very large scale [[photovoltaic]] generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea-pvps.org/products/rep8_02s.htm Summary Energy from the Desert - Practical Proposals for Very Large Scale Photovoltaic Power Generation (VLS-PV) Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613185611/http://www.iea-pvps.org/products/rep8_02s.htm |date=2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased long distance transmission capacity combined with significant amounts of energy storage will be a crucial part of regulating any large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable power sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/67240.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The high [[Intermittent energy source#Penetration|non-firm renewable electricity penetration]] in some regions &lt;!--parts of Germany, Australia and Denmark--&gt; supplies 40% of annual output, but 60% may be reached before additional storage is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://reneweconomy.com.au/german-grid-operator-sees-70-wind-solar-storage-needed-35731/ |title=German grid operator sees 70% wind + solar before storage needed |work=Renew Economy |date=7 December 2015 |accessdate=20 January 2017 |quote=Schucht says, in the region he is operating in, 42 per cent of the power supply (in output, not capacity), came from wind and solar – about the same as South Australia.

====Small-scale facilities====
While smaller scale pumped storage experiences an [[economies of scale|economy of scale]] penalty, there are small-scale installations of such technology, including a recent 13 MW project in Germany. Shell Energy has proposed a 5 MW project in the U.S. state of Washington. Some have proposed small pumped storage plants in buildings, although these are economically unfeasible given the economies of scale present.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Oliveira e Silva |first=Guilherme |last2=Hendrick |first2=Patrick |date=2016-10-01 |title=Pumped hydro energy storage in buildings |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916309874 |journal=Applied Energy |volume=179 |pages=1242–1250 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a large volume of water is required for a meaningful storage capacity which is a difficult fit for an urban setting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, some authors defend its technological simplicity and secure provision of water as important [[Externality|externalities]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

The first use of pumped storage was in the 1890s in [[Electricity sector in Italy|Italy]] and [[Electricity sector in Switzerland|Switzerland]]. In the 1930s reversible hydroelectric turbines became available. These turbines could operate as both turbine-generators and in reverse as electric motor driven pumps. The latest in large-scale engineering technology are variable speed machines for greater efficiency. These machines operate in synchronization with the network frequency when generating, but operate [[Electric motor#Three-phase AC induction motors|asynchronously]] (independent of the network frequency) when pumping.

The first use of pumped-storage in the United States was in 1930 by the Connecticut Electric and Power Company, using a large reservoir located near New Milford, Connecticut, pumping water from the Housatonic River to the storage reservoir 230 feet above.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sigDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=1930+plane+%22Popular&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zxiVTtztJ-Pr0gGvtu2kBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=1930%20plane%20%22Popular&amp;f=true "A Ten-Mile Storage Battery."] ''Popular Science'', July 1930, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018 the Australian federal government announced that 14 sites had been identified in Tasmania for pumped storage hydro, with the potential of adding 4.8GW to the national grid if a second interconnector beneath Bass Strait was constructed.

==Pump-back hydroelectric dams==
Conventional hydroelectric dams may also make use of pumped storage in a hybrid system that both generates power from water naturally flowing into the reservoir as well as storing water pumped back to the reservoir from below the dam. The [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in the US was expanded with a pump-back system in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Alternative Energy and Shale Gas Encyclopedia page 424&lt;/ref&gt; Existing dams may be repowered with reversing turbines thereby extending the length of time the plant can operate at capacity. Optionally a pump back powerhouse such as the [[Richard B. Russell Dam|Russell Dam]] (1992) may be added to a dam for increased generating capacity. Making use of an existing dams upper reservoir and transmission system can expedite projects and reduce costs.

== Potential technologies ==

===Seawater===
Pumped storage plants can operate with seawater, although there are additional challenges compared to using fresh water. In 1999, the 30&amp;nbsp;MW [[Okinawa Yanbaru Seawater Pumped Storage Power Station|Yanbaru project]] in Okinawa was the first demonstration of seawater pumped storage. It has since been decommissioned. A 300 MW seawater-based [[Lanai Pumped Storage Project]] was considered for Lanai, Hawaii, and seawater-based projects have been proposed in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/02/massive-energy-storage-courtesy-west-ireland|title=Massive Energy Storage, Courtesy of West Ireland|author=|date=18 February 2012|website=sciencemag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of proposed projects in the [[Atacama Desert]] in northern Chile would use 600&amp;nbsp;MW of photovoltaic solar (Skies of Tarapacá) together with 300&amp;nbsp;MW of pumped storage (Mirror of Tarapacá) raising seawater {{convert|600|m}} up a coastal cliff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Espejo de Tarapacá|url=http://valhalla.cl/espejo-de-tarapaca/|website=Valhalla|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.power-technology.com/features/featurethe-mirror-of-tarapaca-chilean-power-project-harnesses-both-sun-and-sea-4872272/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underground reservoirs===
The use of underground reservoirs has been investigated. Recent examples include the proposed Summit project in [[Norton, Ohio]], the proposed Maysville project in [[Kentucky]] (underground limestone mine), and the Mount Hope project in [[New Jersey]], which was to have used a former iron mine as the lower reservoir. The proposed energy storage at the [[Callio]] site in [[Pyhäjärvi]] ([[Finland]]) would utilize the deepest base metal mine in Europe, with {{Convert|1450|m|ft}} elevation difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://callio.info/energy-storage/opportunities/|title=Energy storage|last=|first=|date=|work=Callio Pyhäjärvi|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several new underground pumped storage projects have been proposed. Cost-per-kilowatt estimates for these projects can be lower than for surface projects if they use existing underground mine space. There are limited opportunities involving suitable underground space, but the number of underground pumped storage opportunities may increase if abandoned coal mines prove suitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2017/03/german-coal-mine-to-be-reborn-as-giant-pumped-storage-hydro-facility.html|title= German Coal Mine to Be Reborn as Giant Pumped Storage Hydro Facility|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bendigo]], Victoria, Australia, the [http://www.bsg.org.au Bendigo Sustainability Group] has proposed the [https://www.bsg.org.au/bendigo-pumped-hydro-project/ use of the old gold mines under Bendigo for Pumped Hydro Energy Storage].  Bendigo has the greatest concentration of deep shaft hard rock mines anywhere in the world with over 5,000 shafts sunk under Bendigo in the second half of the 19th Century.  The deepest shaft extends 1,406 metres vertically underground.  A recent pre-feasibility study has shown the concept to be viable with a generation capacity of 30 MW and a run time of 6 hours using a water head of over 750 metres.

===Decentralised systems===
Small pumped-storage hydropower plants can be built on streams and within infrastructures, such as drinking water networks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senator Wash|url=http://www.iid.com/water/water-transportation-system/colorado-river-facilities/senator-wash|website=www.iid.com|publisher=Imperial Irrigation District|accessdate=6 August 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artificial snow making infrastructures. Such plants provide distributed [[energy storage]] and distributed flexible [[electricity production]] and can contribute to the decentralized integration of [[intermittent renewable energy]] technologies, such as [[wind power]] and [[solar power]]. Reservoirs that can be used for small pumped-storage hydropower plants could include&lt;ref name=Thesis&gt;Crettenand, N. (2012) "The facilitation of mini and small hydropower in Switzerland: shaping the institutional framework. With a particular focus on storage and pumped-storage schemes". Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). PhD Thesis N° 5356. http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/176337?ln=en&lt;/ref&gt; natural or artificial lakes, reservoirs within other structures such as irrigation, or unused portions of mines or underground military installations. In [[Switzerland]] one study suggested that the total installed capacity of small pumped-storage hydropower plants in 2011 could be increased by 3 to 9 times by providing adequate [[Market-based environmental policy instruments|policy instruments]].&lt;ref name=Thesis /&gt;

===Underwater reservoirs===
{{Further|Stored Energy at Sea}}

In March 2017 the research project StEnSea (Storing Energy at Sea) announced their successful completion of a four-week test of a pumped storage underwater reservoir. In this configuration a hollow sphere submerged and anchored at great depth acts as the lower reservoir, while the upper reservoir is the enclosing body of water. Electricity is created when water is let in via a reversible turbine integrated into the sphere. During off-peak hours the turbine changes direction and pumps the water out again, using "surplus" electricity from the grid. The quantity of power created when water is let in grows proportionally to the height of the column of water above the sphere, in other words: the deeper the sphere is located, the more potential energy it can store, which can be transformed into electric power. On the other hand, pumping the water back out at greater depths also uses up more power, since the turbine-turned-pump must act on the same entire column of water.

As such the energy storage capacity of the submerged reservoir is not governed by the [[gravitational energy]] in the traditional sense, but rather by the [[vertical pressure variation]].

While StEnSea's test took place at a depth of 100&amp;nbsp;m in the fresh water [[Lake Constance]], the technology is foreseen to be used in salt water at greater depths. Since the submerged reservoir needs only a connecting electrical cable, the depth at which it can be employed is limited only by the depth at which the turbine can function, currently limited to 700&amp;nbsp;m. The challenge of designing salt water pumped storage in this underwater configuration brings a range of advantages:
* No land area is required,
* No mechanical structure other than the electrical cable needs to span the distance of the potential energy difference,
* In the presence of sufficient seabed area multiple reservoirs can scale the storage capacity without limits,
* Should a reservoir collapse, the consequences would be limited apart from the loss of the reservoir itself,
* Evaporation from the upper reservoir has no effect on the energy conversion efficiency,
* Transmission of electricity between the reservoir and the grid can be established from a nearby [[offshore wind farm]] limiting transmission loss and obviating the need for onshore cabling permits.

A current commercial design featuring a sphere with an inner diameter of 30&amp;nbsp;m submerged to 700&amp;nbsp;m would correspond to a 20&amp;nbsp;MWh capacity which with a 5&amp;nbsp;MW turbine would lead to a 4-hour discharge time. An energy park with multiple such reservoirs would bring the storage cost to around a few eurocents per kWh with construction and equipment costs in the range €1,200-€1,400 per kW. To avoid excessive transmission cost and loss, the reservoirs should be placed off deep water coasts of densely populated areas, such as Norway, Spain, USA and Japan. With this limitation the concept would allow for worldwide electricity storage of close to 900&amp;nbsp;GWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://forschung-energiespeicher.info/en/projektschau/gesamtliste/projekt-einzelansicht/95/Kugelpumpspeicher_unter_Wasser/ |title= Storing energy at sea |website= forschung-energiespeicher.info |date= 2016-10-17 |accessdate= 2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.energiesystemtechnik.iwes.fraunhofer.de/de/presse-infothek/Presse-Medien/Pressemitteilungen/2016/energiespeicher-von-morgen-stensea.html |title= Unterwasser-Pumpspeicherkraftwerk erfolgreich getestet |work= [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer]] Institute for Wind Energy and Energy System Technology |date= 2017-03-03 |accessdate= 2017-03-06 |language= de |trans-title= Underwater Pumped Storage Powerplant successfully tested}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For comparison, a traditional, gravity-based pumped storage capable of storing 20&amp;nbsp;MWh in a water reservoir the size of a 30&amp;nbsp;m sphere would need a [[hydraulic head]] of 519&amp;nbsp;m with the elevation spanned by a pressurized [[Plumbing#Water pipes|water pipe]] requiring typically a hill or mountain for support.&lt;!-- Potential energy: E = h F = h m g = h \rho V g = h \rho 4/3 π r^3 g = 519.33720 m * 1000 kg/m^3 * 4/3 * π * (15 m)^3 * 9.80665 m/s^2 = 72 GJ = 20 MWh --&gt;

[[File:Rajan Zed Senate Guest Chaplain.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Senator Bob Casey as the Presiding Officer of the Senate directs that "The Sergeant-at-Arms will restore order in the Senate" as Christian protestors interrupt Guest Chaplain Rajan Zed on July 12, 2007]]
The '''Rajan Zed prayer protest''' were events surrounding the first official offering of a [[Hindu]] prayer at the [[United States Senate]].

On July 12, 2007, Rajan Zed, a Hindu cleric and a noted leader in Interfaith Relations from the Indian Association of Northern Nevada based in Reno, appeared at the United States Senate as its guest Chaplain.

==Prelude to the protest==
===AFA and David Barton===
Several days prior to the scheduled prayer the [[American Family Association]] (AFA) called on its membership to phone and email their Senators "expressing your disappointment in the Senate decision to invite a Hindu to open the session with prayer." In the Action Alerts to their membership the AFA cited self-styled historian [[David Barton (author)|David Barton]] saying he wonders "why the U.S. government is seeking the invocation of a non-monotheistic god. Barton points out that since Hindus worship multiple gods, the prayer will be completely outside the American paradigm, flying in the face of the American motto 'One Nation Under God'."&lt;ref name="Previous"/&gt; They quoted Barton as saying "In Hindu[ism], you have not one God, but many, many, many, many, many gods. And certainly that was never in the minds of those who did the Constitution, did the Declaration [of Independence] when they talked about Creator—that's not one that fits here because we don't know which creator we're talking about within the Hindu religion. This [Hinduism] is not a religion that has produced great things in the world.&lt;ref name="Previous"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/senprayer07a.htm|title=Previous Hindu prayer in the House; Opposition prior to the Senate prayer|publisher=ReligiousTolerance.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt; You look at India, you look at Nepal—there's persecution going in both of those countries that is gendered by the religious belief that is present there, and Hindu dominates in both of those countries."&lt;ref name="Barton"/&gt; While admitting the prayer is legal, he stated "One definitely wonders about the pragmatic side of it. What is the message, and why is the message needed? And will it actually communicate anything other than engender with folks like me a lot of questions?"&lt;ref name="Barton"&gt;{{cite news|title=Historian Barton says Hindu prayer before Senate raises concerns|date=July 11, 2007|publisher=One News Now|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2007/07/11/prayer-in-senate-sure-hindu-prayer-blasphemy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Barton take issue with his implication that Hinduism is a polytheistic religion, saying "it is a henotheistic religion, like very early forms worship described in the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament). Hindus recognize a single deity. They view other gods and goddesses as facets, forms, manifestations, or aspects of that one supreme God."&lt;ref name="Previous"/&gt; They also took issue with his claim that Hinduism has not produced great things pointing to contributions by Hinduism like "[[Mahatma Gandhi]] whose ''Path of Nonviolence'' inspired [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] to fight racism and segregation, and formed the basis of [[Nelson Mandela]]'s fight against Apartheid".&lt;ref name="Previous"/&gt; and inventions by Hinduism such as [[Yoga]], [[Kalarippayattu]], [[Ayurveda]], The [[Decimal]] Number System, [[Chess]] and [[Plastic surgery]].

===Faith2Action===
Former U.S. Navy Chaplain, [[Gordon Klingenschmitt]] (who was [[United States military chaplains#Restrictions on religious observance or expression|court-martialed for disobeying a direct order and protesting non-sectarian prayer while in uniform]]) protested the Hindu prayer on July 10, 2007 by going to offices in the Senate and requesting "equal time" to pray "in Jesus' name." [[Harry Reid]]'s office informed him that they wouldn't sponsor him as he was not a constituent of Nevada that the Senator represents. As Klingenschmitt was from New York he requested Hillary Clinton's office give him "equal time". Her staff refused  "because Senate Chaplain Barry Black is a Seventh-Day Adventist who regularly prays on the Senate floor" so they held that the question of "equal time" for "praying in Jesus' name" was moot. Klingenschmitt resented this feeling as Black "prays "'non-sectarian' prayers".&lt;ref name="Away"/&gt; He was told that Black might be able to schedule him as a guest chaplain. Black's staffers told him his appointment calendar was booked till 2009.

===Americans United===
[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] (AU) remembering the [[Venkatachalapathi Samuldrala prayer controversy]] of September, 2000 where a Hindu prayer in the United States House of Representatives sparked controversy and negative comments from the Christian group the [[Family Research Council]] (FRC), AU stated "Now the FRC gets a chance to really make amends. We challenge the group to issue a public statement affirming religious diversity in America and welcoming Hindus to our rich tapestry of faiths. If we must have such prayers before Congress, they should respect religious diversity. Surely the FRC has no problem with that?"&lt;ref name="Previous"/&gt;

===Zed's comments===
Rajan Zed, an Indian immigrant and American citizen, had served as guest Chaplain for the Nevada State Senate and Assembly and delivered the first Hindu prayer there (on March 19 and May 7, 2007).&lt;ref name="SF"/&gt; Speaking of his upcoming appearance before the Federal Senate he spoke about the prayer in an email to Cybercast News Service. Zed, apparently aware of the email campaign to prevent the prayer, anticipated the invitation would not be revoked and the prayer would go smoothly. He said "I believe that despite our philosophical differences, we should work together for the common objectives of human improvement, love, and respect for others." He called the event "an illustrious day for all Americans and a memorable day for Indian Americans when prayers from ancient Hindu scriptures will be read in the great hall of democracy". He stated that the prayer would draw on Hindu religious texts including the Rig Veda, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad-Gita, and likely begin and end with "'OM,' the mystical syllable containing the universe, which in Hinduism is used to introduce and conclude religious work." He stressed it would be "universal in approach."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hindu Prayer Will Open Senate Session in July|author=Nathan Burchfiel|date=July 7, 2008|url=http://cnsnews.com/node/7489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prayer and protest==
At the Senate chambers on July 12, 2007 Rajan Zed (wearing the traditional sandalpaste [[tilak]] on his forehead, a [[Rudraksha|ruddraksh]] [[Hindu prayer beads|mala]], and [[Saffron (color)#Saffron in culture|saffron colored clothing]]) approached the podium. He was prepared to give the first official Hindu prayer ever offered at the Senate as a guest chaplain upon the request of Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] of Nevada.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; This would also open the day's proceedings (which were largely centered around the Iraq war).

As Zed moved to start the prayer he was loudly interrupted by Ante Pavkovic who stood up in the gallery holding a Bible aloft and shouting "Lord Jesus, forgive us father for allowing a prayer of the wicked, which is an abomination in your sight. This is an abomination. We shall have no other gods before You. Lord Jesus, have mercy on our nation for allowing this abomination, this idolatry, for violating the First Commandment 'Thou shalt have no other gods before me.' God forgive our nation, in Jesus name, Amen."&lt;ref name="Away"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleefeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flip"/&gt; The presiding officer for the Senate that morning was Senator [[Bob Casey, Jr.]] he immediately ordered the Sergeant-at-Arms to restore order in the Senate Chamber and the Capitol police restrained Ante who continued to shout first quoting Psalm 33:12 "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord" and then one of the Christian Scripture's Ten Commandments "Thou shalt have no other gods before me", closing with "You are the One true living God."&lt;ref name="Flip"/&gt;

With Ante in custody, Zed began his prayer but was interrupted by Kathy Pavkovic who shouted a quote from John 14:6 "Jesus is the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." Again Casey ordered the Sergeant-at-Arms to restore order and the Capitol Police moved to arrest Kathy Pavkovic.&lt;ref name="Oct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleefeld"&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Kleefeld|title=Christian Right Activists Disrupt First Hindu Prayer In Senate: "This Is An Abomination"|publisher=TPMCafe|date=July 12, 2007|url=http://intellibriefs.blogspot.com/2007/07/christian-right-activists-disrupt-hindu.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Christians disrupt Hindu prayer in Senate|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/senprayer07b.htm|publisher=ReligiousTolerance.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she was restrained by the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Pavkovics' daughter Christan Renee Sugar yelled "Father, forgive us for betraying your Son Jesus!" and was also restrained.&lt;ref name="Kleefeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flip"/&gt; As they were escorted out they continued to direct their shouts at Zed, saying "No Lord but Jesus Christ!" and "There's only one true God!"&lt;ref name="Kleefeld"/&gt;

The three protesters belonged to [[Operation Save America|Operation Save America/Operation Rescue]] and had traveled to D.C. from North Carolina "to lobby against a hate-crimes bill that would extend certain protections to gay people".&lt;ref name="Oct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt; They were arrested by the Capitol police and charged with a misdemeanor for disrupting Congress.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hindu prayer in Senate disrupted|date=7/12/2007|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19729245/ns/politics/t/hindu-prayer-senate-disrupted/|publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; While being handcuffed Mr. Pavkovic told reporters that they were motivated to act because they were "Christians and patriots".&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleefeld"/&gt;

After a period of visible discomfort Zed was able to proceed with his prayer (which also made mention of the recent death of [[Lady Bird Johnson]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Let us pray.
We meditate on the transcendental Glory of the Deity Supreme, who is inside the heart of the Earth, inside the life of the sky, and inside the soul of the Heaven. May He stimulate and illuminate our minds.
Lead us from the unreal to the real, from darkness to light, and from death to immortality. May we be protected together. May we be nourished together. May we work together with great vigor. May our study be enlightening. May no obstacle arise between us.
May the Senators strive constantly to serve the welfare of the world, performing their duties with the welfare of others always in mind, because by devotion to selfless work one attains the supreme goal of life. May they work carefully and wisely, guided by compassion and without thought for themselves.
United your resolve, united your hearts, may your spirits be as one, that you may long dwell in unity and concord.
Peace, peace, peace be unto all.
Lord, we ask You to comfort the family of former First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson.
Amen.&lt;ref name="Record"&gt;{{cite book|title=Congressional Record, Proceedings and Debates of the 110th Congress First Session|volume=153|publisher=United States Congress|page=S9069|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-07-12/pdf/CREC-2007-07-12-pt1-PgS9069-8.pdf#page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the prayer Reid (himself of a minority faith - [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]) rose to defend the choice of Zed especially during debates about war. Reid went over all of Zed's involvement in causes around Reno and Nevada, and spoke of his own encounters with students from India while he was attending Utah State. He remembered giving car rides to these students and being invited with his young wife to a traditional Indian feast when it was near his time to graduate which he recalled fondly. During this feast the Indian students gave him gifts including a hand carved statue of Gandhi which Reid said "I have protected and saved that all these years. It is in my office. I have always had it there. The reason I mention that is that if people have any misunderstanding about Indians and Hindus, all they  have to do is think of Gandhi. Here is a man who changed the world, a man who believed in peace. We heard the prayer: Peace, peace, peace. If there was ever a time, with this international war on terror that we are fighting now, where people have to understand how important peace is, think of Gandhi, a man who gave his life for peace, a tiny little man in physical stature but a giant in morality. Gandhi is the man that Martin Luther King, Jr., followed. ...I think it speaks well of our country that someone representing the faith of about a billion people comes here and can speak in communication with our heavenly Father regarding peace. I am grateful he is here. I am thankful he was able to offer this prayer of peace in the Capitol. I say to everyone concerned, think of Gandhi. If you have a problem in the world, think what this great man has done to bring peace and nonviolence to a troubled world."&lt;ref name="Record"/&gt;

Ante Pavkovic in a statement made to Gordon Klingenschmitt after being released from jail, said "The Senate was already being disturbed before we arrived. The sin of Hindu idolatry was greatly disrupting the sanctity of the Senate. We only prayed to preserve the covenant our nation has with the most-high God, who established our Republic, in Jesus name."&lt;ref name="Away"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hindu chaplain prays, Christian chaplain told 'go away'|date=2007-07-16|url=http://www.wnd.com/2007/07/42585/|author=Gordon James Klingenschmitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Wildmon, president of the AFA that had been calling for its members to contact Senators to try and prevent the prayer, distanced his group from the act of civil disobedience, "We would not ever encourage shouting in the gallery like that, we asked people to contact their Senators to show their disapproval."&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Hindu Press International|title=Head Of Christian Right Group Calls Hindu Senate Invocation "Gross Idolatry"|date=July 14, 2007|url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/blogs-news/hindu-press-international/head-of-christian-right-group-calls-hindu-senate-invocation--gross-idolatry-/6928.html|author=Eric Kleefeld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2007 the three protestors appeared before Superior Court Judge Robert Rigsby, in Washington, D.C.. While Operation Save America had declared that [[Roy Moore]] (sometimes referred to as Alabama's "Ten Commandments judge") would personally defend the three, he did not but his "Foundation for Moral Law" sent Ben DuPre to represent them.&lt;ref name="Oct"/&gt; The protestors were told the charges would be dropped if they did not return to the Capitol grounds for a year.&lt;ref name="Oct"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Church &amp; State|title=Senate Prayer Protesters Barred From Returning to Capitol Grounds|date=October 2007|url=http://www.au.org/church-state/october-2007-church-state/people-events/senate-prayer-protesters-barred-from-returning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benham's statements==
Operation Save America released a statement for the press entitled "Theology Moved to the Senate and was Arrested" by their director Rev. [[Flip Benham]]. The statement took Senators to task for not joining the protest. It stated that the Congressional "chamber was violated by a false Hindu god. The Senate was opened with a Hindu prayer placing the false god of Hinduism on a level playing field with the One True God, Jesus Christ. This would never have been allowed by our Founding Fathers. Not one Senator had the backbone to stand as our Founding Fathers stood. They stood on the Gospel of Jesus Christ! There were three in the audience with the courage to stand and proclaim, 'Thou shalt have no other gods before me.' They were immediately removed from the chambers, arrested, and are in jail now. God bless those who stand for Jesus as we know that He stands for them."

Benham also published an essay about the protest on the Operation Save America website "A Hindu opening prayer in the United States Senate? How the Mighty have fallen! Have our elected officials forgotten so quickly the God of our Pilgrim Forefathers, the God of our Founding Fathers, and the God who has blessed America and made her the mightiest nation in the world? Has Jesus, who made this nation free, been prostrated to the same level as every other religion? The events that took place in the Senate chambers yesterday would indicate that the answer is, "Yes!" Well then, what happens when United States senators fail to stand for truth, and bow their knee to the false god of political correctness? Simple Christian moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, sons and daughters, must stand up for Jesus!"&lt;ref name="protest"/&gt; He praised the three for giving a "rebuke to a nation that has forsaken the God of our fathers. They rose to their feet to rightly proclaim the one true God—Jesus Christ—the One before Whom every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess."&lt;ref name="Flip"&gt;{{cite web|title=What happens when Senators won't stand?

Flip Benham|url=http://www.nriinternet.com/NRIhindu/Rajan_Zed/Prayer_in_Senate_Disrupted.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the protest a "simple act of biblical obedience" which "has inspired and encouraged the hearts of hundreds of thousands of Christians across this nation."&lt;ref name="protest"/&gt; He warned politicians in the upcoming general election of 2008 that "The Christian vote is not for sale. Republicans you cannot depend upon us. If you can't find it in yourself to stand for Christ—we can't find it in ourselves to vote for you." He concluded saying "The falsehood of Hinduism was eloquently challenged yesterday by those who know the truth that sets people free—Jesus. We pray that their lives will inspire many to do the same and call our nation to repentance and to return to the God of our fathers. May the hallowed halls and chambers of the Congress of the United States of America never again entertain the false religions of this age."&lt;ref name="protest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/senprayer07c.htm|title=Three Christians disrupt Hindu prayer in Senate - Reactions to the protest|publisher=ReligiousTolerance.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later when speaking to a reporter, Benham said of the protest "What we have here is just a wonderful example of Christian theology becoming biography in the sacred chamber of the United States Senate, as a Hindu was offering up a prayer to open up the session this morning. And the folks that were there [the Pavkovics]...waited for the Senate, or a Senator with a backbone, to remind the Hindu that there is one God who made this country great, and his name is Jesus. ...They thought they needed to go and represent the Lord who made this nation great. ...other religions [are] being held on a par with Christianity. Of course, we have said that is not true, that indeed Christianity is one way." Responding to the AFA's criticism that the protestors should have petitioned their Senators rather than break the law, Benham said "Our answer is, when one stands up in the face of gross idolatry being allowed in the Senate, in the chamber of the United States Senate, it is incumbent on a Christian to stand up and speak the truth. No matter what, we must obey God rather than men. When you stand up and are arrested, and the Hindu is allowed to go free, this country has gone upside-down." "Our answer is," Benham said, "When one stands up in the face of gross idolatry being allowed in the Senate, in the chamber of the United States Senate, it is incumbent on a Christian to stand up and speak the truth. No matter what, we must obey God rather than men." When pressed by a reporter, he clarified that he did not think non-Christians should be arrested, but asked "Now, why are Hindus allowed here? Why are Muslims allowed here? Because we are a nation that's free, built upon the principles of almighty God."&lt;ref name="HP"/&gt;

==Other responses==
===Family Research Council===
Having made no response to Americans United call to come out in support of religious diversity before the prayer took place, [[Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins]] an official for the Christian group the [[Family Research Council]] issued a statement on the day of the protest saying "No one can legitimately challenge the fact that the God America refers to in the pledge, our national motto, and other places is the monotheistic God of the Jewish and Christian faith. ...There is no historic connection between America and the polytheistic creed of the Hindu faith. I seriously doubt that Americans want to change the motto, 'In God we Trust,' which Congress adopted in 1955, to, 'In gods we Trust.' That is essentially what the United States Senate did today."&lt;ref name="protest"/&gt;

===AFA===
Having called on its members to act to prevent it from ever happening and distancing the group from the methods of the protestors, the American Family Association's Tim Wildmon stated his group's disgust that the prayer had gone ahead in the first place, "This goes against all history and tradition of our country. This fella does not even believe in one God as the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence speak of.... So we object to this kind of prayer before the United States Senate. The god of popular culture today is tolerance and multi-culturalism, and so I guess the Senate wants to see how far they can go with this idea that all religion and faiths are equal and the same. Hopefully, it won't happen again."&lt;ref name="Holy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Holy War On The Hill: Hindu-Led Prayer In Senate Sparks Religious Right Crusade Against American Pluralism|date=September 2007|url=http://www.au.org/church-state/september-2007-church-state/featured/holy-war-on-the-hill|author=Joseph L. Conn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Klingenschmitt===
Gordon James Klingenschmitt, who was sitting in the galleries when the protest was made, wrote "No senators seemed to notice, nor did any object, while Zed committed the sin of idolatry, right there in public, violating the first of God's Ten Commandments with full government permission. Sure, a Hindu prayer (to millions of false gods) may be 'legal' by American law, but it still violates God's law: 'I am the Lord Thy God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.' Imagine the surprise of idolaters on judgment day, arguing to the most-high God that He shouldn't be angry, 'because idolatry was perfectly legal according to American law.' Perhaps that day God will remind them of Paul's warning to the Corinthians, 'Idolaters ... will not inherit the kingdom of heaven.' ...Had the Pavkovic family simply said 'Amen' to the Hindu prayer, or prayed a Hindu 'ohm' meditation, they'd have been viewed as supportive, not disruptive, and wouldn't have been arrested. But since the content of their prayer voiced opposition to Hinduism, so they were arrested and jailed as 'disrupters,' arrested for the content of their prayer, nothing else. I applaud their spiritual courage, perhaps the only people present who feared God's law more than man's law."&lt;ref name="Away"/&gt;

===Americans United===
[[Barry W. Lynn]] of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] held that "This shows the intolerance of many Religious Right activists. They say they want more religion in the public square, but it's clear they mean only their religion. America is a land of extraordinary religious diversity, and the Religious Right just can't seem to accept that fact. I don't think the Senate should open with prayers, but if it's going to happen, the invocations ought to reflect the diversity of the American people. The Religious Right promotes a deeply skewed version of American history. Our founders wanted separation of church and state and full religious liberty for all faith traditions. The episode today shows we still have a ways to go to achieve that goal."&lt;ref name="protest"/&gt;

==Rajan Zed's reaction==
Speaking to a reporter Zed said "I thought that it will be a simple, roughly 90-second prayer, and it will go very smoothly (as the prayers are a time for reflection), like the ones I delivered in the Nevada State Assembly and Nevada State Senate a few months back. And everybody will go back to the normal routine. ...This was reportedly the first Senate prayer since its formation in 1789, which was protested."&lt;ref name="Holy"/&gt; Reflecting on the reaction to the protest, he said "Although the blogs it generated were mixed, the emails and letters I received about the prayer and protest were all inspiring, most of these apologetic [about the interruption] and thankful. Although we have much more conscious awareness of religious pluralism today than in the past, the religious as well as non-religious people need to have deeper, broader and more inclusive understanding of religion, which still wields huge power."&lt;ref name="Holy"/&gt; Thinking of those who opposed the prayer he said "Despite our philosophical differences, we have similar objectives. We all believe in a superior being and we simply differ on how each of us perceives/embodies/responds to Ultimate/Divine Reality. Differences begin when we start claiming to be the sole guardians of 'truth.' We should share our quest for truth. Dialogue will make us spiritually richer. We need to overcome the prejudices handed down to us by the previous generations."&lt;ref name="Holy"/&gt;

==State Legislatures==
Soon after the protest at the U.S. Senate Rajan Zed served as guest chaplain offering a Hindu prayer before the California State Senate. Zed delivered the prayer without incident on August 27, 2007 with the appreciation of State Sen. Elaine Alquist and the official State Senate Chaplain Rev. James Richardson, an Episcopal priest. There was no complaints over the prayer from California's Conservative Christian Community, and the Rev. Louis Sheldon, who founded the state's "Traditional Values Coalition" declared "I don't see any problem with it at all. I would have no problems with a Hindu praying, just as I wouldn't an evangelical Christian." National groups continued in their opposition to Hindu Legislative prayers with Wildmon speaking for the AFA stating "We're not opposed to the ability of people to worship their own gods or god, but when it comes to our civil government...it's always been the recognition of the God of the Bible. Every religion is not equal. That's my belief. That's logic."&lt;ref name="SF"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/27/BALVRQDFR.DTL#ixzz1PMf9lT8l|author=Haley Davies|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Hindu chaplain Rajan Zed leads state Senate in opening prayer|date=August 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; California's Chief Sergeant-at-Arms for the state Senate admitted that they had taken extra security precautions in case of protests against the Zed's prayer.&lt;ref name="SF"/&gt;

Seeking to promote understanding of Hinduism and "emphasizes the multicultural and religious freedom aspect of this country" throughout the end of 2007 and into 2008 Zed made requests and was granted a guest chaplaincy to recite Hindu prayers at State Legislatures in New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Washington, Oregon, and Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Senate-opens-with-its-first-Hindu-prayer-1265290.php#ixzz1PNMzDzgv|title=Senate opens with its first Hindu prayer: Traveling chaplain on a mission in legislatures|author=John Iwasak|publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calls for candidates to denounce==
As the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential elections]] approached American Hindu organizations urged presidential candidates to denounce the protestors. The executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, Ishani Chowdhury, stated "if you look at it as a reflection of a larger number of people...we need people to condemn what happened and highlight the need for dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hindu Groups Ask '08 Hopefuls to Criticize Protest|author=Michelle Boorstein|publisher=Washington Post|date=July 27, 2007|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/27/AR2007072700206.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zed's later legislative invocations and the 2015 Idaho prayer boycott==
Since the 2007 protest Rajan Zed offered Hindu opening prayers in various State Senates and State Assemblies/Houses-of-Representatives and at various County Commissions/Boards and City Councils across the United States. On June 19, 2014 he offered the opening prayer as a guest chaplain at the United States House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US House of Representatives to open with Hindu prayer|date=June 17, 2014|author=Rajan Zed|url=http://www.worldreligionnews.com/religion-news/hinduism/us-house-representatives-open-hindu-prayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events occurred without any notable public controversy.

In March 2015 Rajan Zed was the focus of another protest of legislators over his leading a legislative invocation at the Idaho State Senate.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; Sen. Steve Vick, with reported support from his constituents, tried to prevent Zed from offering the prayer. Failing to prevent the prayer Vick and two other Republican state senators refused to enter the chamber until Zed had finished.&lt;ref name=Quinn/&gt; Vick held that having a Hindu invocation would "send a message we're not happy with the way America is" and held that people under Hinduism "have a caste system. They worship cows."&lt;ref name=Quinn/&gt; Joining in the boycott of the prayer was Sen. Sheryl Nuxoll who stated "Hindu is a false faith with false gods. I think it's great that Hindu people can practice their religion, but since we're the Senate, we're setting an example of what we, Idaho, believe."&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quinn&gt;{{cite news|title=Idaho Lawmakers Refuse to Hear Hindu Prayer|author=Rob Quinn|publisher=Newser|date=March 4, 2015|url=http://www.newser.com/story/203515/idaho-lawmakers-refuse-to-hear-hindu-prayer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen. Lori Den Hartog joined the boycott holding it would be disingenuous to her Christian faith to attend and "It was a personal decision, I didn't want to announce it prior to the event."&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; Zed's prayer as guest chaplain was in English and Sanskrit focusing on selflessness and peace.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/idaho-senate-opens-hindu-prayer-lawmakers-protest-29361944|publisher=Associated Press|title=Idaho Senate Opens With Hindu Prayer, 3 Lawmakers Protest|date=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lithuania]] does not recognise [[same-sex marriage]]s or [[civil unions|civil partnerships]]. A bill to grant unmarried couples (including same-sex couples) some limited rights is pending in the Lithuanian Parliament ([[Seimas]]).

==Civil partnerships==
{{Same-sex marriage map Europe|align=left|size=250px}}

On 25 March 2015, 9 members of the [[Seimas]] (Parliament) from the [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Liberal Movement (Lithuania)|Liberal Movement]] introduced a partnership bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.delfi.lt/lithuania/politics/9-mps-register-bill-on-same-sex-partnership.d?id=67530578 9 MPs register bill on same-sex partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter2/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=1018362 Civilinio kodekso 3.1, 3.3, 3.16, 3.140, 3.150, 3.194, 3.229, 3.230, 3.231, 3.234, 3.235 straipsnių ir III knygos III dalies ir VI skyriaus pavadinimų pakeitimo, Kodekso papildymo 3.230(1) ir 3.230(2) straipsniais, bei 3.232 ir 3.233 straipsnių pripažinimo netekusiais galios]&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister and leader of the Social Democratic Party [[Algirdas Butkevičius]] expressed his opposition to the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.delfi.lt/lithuania/politics/pm-against-legalisation-of-same-sex-partnerships.d?id=67536878 PM against legalisation of same-sex partnerships]&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May 2015, the Committee on Legal Affairs announced that they could find no constitutional barriers to same-sex civil partnerships in the Baltic State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/lithuanian-parliament-committee-%E2%80%98constitution-no-barrier-gay-civil-partnerships%E2%80%99110515 Lithuanian parliament committee: ‘constitution no barrier to gay civil partnerships’]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was not voted upon and died at the end of Parliament's term in November 2016. A similar bill was introduced by deputies from the Liberal Movement on 30 May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAP/30c639a0451011e7b465dc41e35792b9?positionInSearchResults=3&amp;searchModelUUID=26f829cf-cecd-4807-9e2e-7dd2a4f7c415 Civilinio kodekso 2.18, 2.19, 3.3, 3.16, 3.140, 3.141, 3.143, 3.146, 3.147, 3.150, 3.155 straipsnių, Kodekso Trečiosios knygos VI dalies XV skyriaus ir 5.13, 6.588, 6.590, 6.744 straipsnių pakeitimo įstatymo projektas]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was rejected in its first reading in a 29-59 vote with 20 abstentions, on 15 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{lt icon}} [http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/seime-zlugo-bandymas-iteisinti-vyro-ir-moters-bei-homoseksualu-partneryste.d?id=74950844 Seime žlugo bandymas įteisinti vyro ir moters bei homoseksualų partnerystę]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/lithuania-tries-fails-recognize-sex-couples/ Lithuania tries, but fails to recognize same-sex couples]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cohabitation agreements==
In 2017, the [[Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union]] and the [[Homeland Union]] proposed a bill to establish "cohabitation agreements" as an alternative to civil partnerships. The proposed legislation would guarantee cohabitants hospital visitation rights and the right to inherit a late partner's property. Povilas Urbšys, one of the authors of the proposal said: "Our registered project will effectively contribute to legal clarity, regulate property rights and some property unrelated relations between people living together and will also help to avoid negative consequences when the cohabitation is dissolved."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgl.lt/en/?p=17332 Lithuanian Peasant and Green Party Propose “Cohabitation Agreements” Instead of Partnerships]&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal, which was criticised by LGBT groups, explicitly stipulates that the cohabitants entering the agreement do not intend to create family relations. The proposal was preliminarily approved by the Seimas with 46 votes for, 17 votes against and 6 abstentions on 31 May 2017 and sent to further consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgl.lt/en/?p=17403 Seimas Approves the Proposal on “Cohabitation Agreements” as Alternative to Partnership Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lt icon}} [https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAP/2eed4fd03fbe11e7b8e5a254f4e1c3a7 Civilinio kodekso 6.589, 6.969, 6.971, 6.973, 6.978 straipsnių pakeitimo įstatymo projektas]&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October 2017, the Lithuanian Government announced its support for the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{lt icon}} [https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/en/legalAct/698dcde0bd4a11e79122ea2db7aeb5f0 DĖL LIETUVOS RESPUBLIKOS CIVILINIO KODEKSO 6.589, 6.969, 6.971, 6.973, 6.978 STRAIPSNIŲ PAKEITIMO ĮSTATYMO PROJEKTO NR.

On 14 February 2018, appearing at an LGBT rally in Vilnius, Prime Minister [[Saulius Skvernelis]] called on the Seimas to recognise same-sex partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thedailybeast.com/lithuanian-prime-minister-wants-same-sex-partnerships-law Lithuanian Prime Minister Wants Same-Sex Partnerships Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Same-sex marriage==
Same-sex marriages are not legal in Lithuania, with the Civil Code defining [[marriage]] as a voluntary agreement between a man and a woman. Moreover, there is an additional article in the Civil Code that explicitly bans same-sex marriages. Nevertheless, a drive to amend the [[Constitution of Lithuania|Constitution]] to ban same-sex marriages was reportedly under way in December 2005 by a [[Social conservatism|conservative]] member of the [[Seimas|Parliament]], who had started collecting signatures for such an amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltictimes.com/hot1.php?art_id=14314 "Lithuania could follow in Latvia’s footsteps on banning gay marriage"] The Baltic Times, December 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Sabatauskas, chairman of the Parliament's Legal Committee, however, denounced the plan and said it was unneeded. Some [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s say Lithuania's Constitution already bans same-sex marriage. The Constitution states: "Marriage shall be concluded upon the free mutual consent of man and woman." The actual effect of this statement is unknown and it has yet to be challenged in court.

==Public opinion==
According to the 2015 Eurobarometer, 24% of Lithuanians supported same-sex marriage, the fourth lowest among EU member states alongside [[Slovakia]]. EU-wide support was 61%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equineteurope.org/IMG/pdf/ebs_437_en.pdf DISCRIMINATION IN THE EU IN 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3096">'''Status–income disequilibrium''' (sometimes [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''SID''') is a political term used to describe a desirable high [[social status | status]] job with relatively low [[income]]. It is a variation on the sociological term "[[status inconsistency]]".  The phrase was coined by ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] in his 1996 article [https://www.weeklystandard.com/david-brooks/the-tragedy-of-sid "The Tragedy of SID"].  He wrote:
{{quote|The sufferers of this malady, have jobs that give them high status but low income. They lunch on an expense account at [[The Palm (restaurant)|The Palm]], but dine at home on macaroni. All day long the phone-message slips pile up on their desks—calls from famous people seeking favors—but at night they realize the tub needs scrubbing, so it's down on the hands and knees with the Ajax. At work they are aristocrats, Kings of the [[Meritocracy]], schmoozing with [[Felix Rohatyn]]. At home they are peasants, wondering if they can really afford to have orange juice every morning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.weeklystandard.com/david-brooks/the-tragedy-of-sid David Brooks, "The Tragedy of SID"], ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', May 6, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

David Brooks characterized the "sufferers" from SID in a long list, which includes [[News program|TV news]] producers, [[museum curator]]s,  [[classical music]] performers, [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House aides]], and politicians, among others.  Other journalists applied the term to "authors and academics",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/node/160908 NS essay – The honours system, far from being abolished, should be hugely expanded], by [[Richard Reeves (American writer)|Richard Reeves]], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 08 November, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; journalists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2132709/ Are Journalists Underpaid?], by [[Daniel Gross]], ''[[Slate Magazine]]'', December 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; writers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/05/debt_a_writers_life.php Debt: A Writer's Life], by [[Megan McArdle]], ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 15 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[British middle class]]es",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3635427/The-Coping-Classes---Part-1-Why-do-we-all-feel-so-damn-poor.html The Coping Classes – Part 1], by Judith Woods, ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 31 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and even to the [[List of United Kingdom MPs|British MPs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2219044/ No, You May Not Put My Taxes Toward Your Floating Duck House],  [[Anne Applebaum]], ''[[Slate Magazine]]'', May 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4116">The conventional explanation until 1951 for the cause of [[famine]]s was the decline of food availability (abbreviated as FAD for food availability decline). The assumption was that the central cause of all famines was a decline in food availability.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2010|p=}} However this does not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by famines while others were insulated from them.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}}

==Failure of exchange entitlements==
It has been suggested{{By whom|date=October 2018}} that the causal mechanism for precipitating starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food availability such as the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange his primary entitlement, i.e. labor for rice, when his employment became erratic or was completely eliminated.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} According to the proposed theory, famines are due to an inability of a person to exchange his entitlements rather than to food unavailability.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} This theory is called the failure of exchange entitlements or FEE in short.

==Lack of democracy==
[[Amartya Sen]] advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, A. ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation,'' 1981; Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0198284632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, [[Niger]], and [[Malawi]], he finds that "democracy is no panacea against famine." Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the [[Famine in India#1972 Maharashtra drought|Maharashtra famine]] involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.{{sfn|Rubin|2009}}

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study ''Starvation and India's democracy'' affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid [[Malnutrition in India|severe under-nutrition]] and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.{{sfn|Banik|2007}}

According to a FEWSNET report, "Famines are not natural phenomena, they are catastrophic political failures."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/reactions/fewsnet-report-260000-people-died-somalia-famine&lt;/ref&gt;

In a social context, '''trust''' has several connotations.&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, D. H., and Chervany, N. L. (1996). [http://www.misrc.umn.edu/wpaper/wp96-04.htm The Meanings of Trust. Scientific report, University of Minnesota.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930083112/http://www.misrc.umn.edu/wpaper/wp96-04.htm |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions of trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Davis | first2 = J.H. | last3 = Schoorman | first3 = F.D. | year = 1995 | title = An integrative model of organizational trust | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 709–734 | doi=10.5465/amr.1995.9508080335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bamberger, Walter (2010). [http://www.ldv.ei.tum.de/en/research/fidens/interpersonal-trust/ "Interpersonal Trust – Attempt of a Definition"]. Scientific report, Technische Universität München. Retrieved 2011-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; typically refer to a situation characterized by the following aspects: One party (trustor) is willing to rely on the actions of another party (trustee); the situation is directed to the future. In addition, the trustor (voluntarily or forcedly) abandons control over the actions performed by the trustee. As a consequence, the trustor is uncertain about the outcome of the other's actions; they can only develop and evaluate expectations. The uncertainty involves the risk of failure or harm to the trustor if the trustee will not behave as desired.

Trust can be attributed to relationships between people. It can be demonstrated that humans have a natural disposition to trust and to judge trustworthiness that can be traced to the neurobiological structure and activity of a human brain. Some studies indicate that trust can be altered e.g. by the application of [[oxytocin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kosfeld | first1 = M. | last2 = Heinrichs | first2 = M. | last3 = Zak | first3 = P. J. | last4 = Fischbacher | first4 = U. | last5 = Fehr | first5 = E. | year = 2005 | title = Oxytocin increases trust in humans | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = | pages = 673–676 | doi=10.1038/nature03701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to the relationship between people and technology, the attribution of trust is a matter of dispute. The [[intentional stance]]&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D.C. (1989) The Intentional Stance. Bradford Books.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates that trust can be validly attributed to human relationships with complex technologies. However, rational reflection leads to the rejection of an ability to trust technological artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;Shneiderman, B. (2000) Designing trust into online experiences. Communications of the ACM Volume 43, Number 12, Pages 57-59&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key current challenges in the social sciences is to re-think how the rapid progress of technology has impacted constructs such as trust. This is specifically true for information technology that dramatically alters causation in social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. (2005) Risk: a sociological theory. AldineTransaction.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the social sciences, the subtleties of trust are a subject of ongoing research. In [[sociology]] and [[psychology]] the degree to which one party trusts another is a measure of [[belief]] in the [[honesty]], fairness, or [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]] of another party. The term "[[confidence]]" is more appropriate for a belief in the [[Skill|competence]] of the other party. A failure in trust may be [[forgive]]n more easily if it is interpreted as a failure of competence rather than a lack of benevolence or honesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MNkr0r5QZIYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=failure+in+trust+lack+of+competence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t1EVV5YjwI&amp;sig=N8bNpc6hakMIcLcRtHH3YJ872cM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji6eSMkJbXAhUkMJoKHZBVCWsQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Trust: Forms, Foundations, Functions, Failures and Figures|first=B.|last=Nooteboom|date=29 October 2017|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|accessdate=29 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[economics]], trust is often conceptualized as reliability in transactions. In all cases trust is a [[heuristic]] decision rule, allowing the human to deal with complexities that would require unrealistic effort in rational reasoning.

==Sociology==
When it comes to trust, sociology is concerned with the position and role of trust in social systems. Interest in trust has grown significantly since the early eighties, from the early works of Luhmann,&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. (1979) Trust and Power. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Barber&lt;ref&gt;Barber, B. (1983) The Logic and Limits of Trust. Rutgerts University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Giddens&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, A. (1984). The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration; Polity Press, Cambridge 1984&lt;/ref&gt; (see&lt;ref&gt;Sztompka, P. (1999) Trust: A Sociological Theory. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; for a more detailed overview). This growth of interest in trust has been stimulated by on-going changes in society, characterised as late [[modernity]] and [[post-modernity]].

Trust is one of several [[social constructs]], an element of the social reality.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J. R. (1995) The Construction of Social Reality. The Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; It does not exist outside of our vision of the other. This image can be real or imaginary, but it is this one which permits the creation of the Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Construction of Trust|last=Allison I. Carter|first=Linda R. Weber|publisher=Kluwer Academic/ Plenum Publishers|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other constructs, frequently discussed together with trust, are: control, confidence, risk, meaning and power. Trust is naturally attributable to relationships between social actors, both individuals and groups (social systems). Because trust is a social construct, it is valid to discuss whether trust can be trusted (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Gambetta, D. (2000) Can We Trust Trust? In: Gambetta, D. (ed.) Trust: Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations, electronic edition, Department of Sociology, University of Oxford, chapter 13, pp. 213-237.&lt;/ref&gt;), i.e. whether social trust operates as expected.

Sviatoslav contends that society needs trust because it increasingly finds itself operating at the edge between confidence in what is known from everyday experience, and contingency of new possibilities. Without trust, all contingent possibilities should be always considered, leading to a paralysis of inaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braynov|first=Sviatoslav|date=2002|title=Contracting with uncertain level of Trust|url=|journal=Computational Intelligence|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trust can be seen as a bet on one of contingent futures, the one that may deliver benefits. Once the bet is decided (i.e. trust is granted), the trustor suspends his or her disbelief, and the possibility of a negative course of action is not considered at all. Because of it, trust acts as a reductor of social complexity, allowing for actions that are otherwise too complex to be considered (or even impossible to consider at all); specifically for cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bachmann | first1 = R | year = 2001 | title = Trust, Power and Control in Transorganizational Relations | url = | journal = Organization Studies | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 337–365 | doi=10.1177/0170840601222007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociology tends to focus on two distinct views: the macro view of social systems, and a micro view of individual social actors (where it borders with [[social psychology]]). Similarly, views on trust follow this dichotomy. Therefore, on one side the systemic role of trust can be discussed, with a certain disregard to the psychological complexity underpinning individual trust. The behavioural approach to trust is usually assumed&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, J. (1990) Foundations of Social Theory. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; while actions of social actors are measurable, leading to statistical modelling of trust. This systemic approach can be contrasted&lt;ref&gt;Castelfranchi, C., Falcone, R. (2000) Trust Is Much More than Subjective Probability: Mental Components and Sources of Trust. Proc. of the 33rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences-Volume 6.&lt;/ref&gt; with studies on social actors and their decision-making process, in anticipation that understanding of such a process will explain (and allow to model) the emergence of trust.

Sociology acknowledges that the contingency of the future creates dependency between social actors, and specifically that the trustor becomes dependent on the trustee. Trust is seen as one of the possible methods to resolve such a dependency, being an attractive alternative to control.&lt;ref&gt;Mollering, G. (2005) The Trust/Control Duality: An Integrative Perspective on Positive Expectations of Others. In: Int. Sociology, September 2005, Vol. 20(3): 283–305. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Trust is specifically valuable if the trustee is much more powerful than the trustor, yet the trustor is under social obligation to support the trustee.&lt;ref&gt;Baier, A. (1986) Trust and antitrust. Ethics, vol. 96, pp. 231-260. Reprinted in: Moral Prejudices. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern information technologies not only facilitated the transition towards post-modern society, but they also challenged traditional views on trust. Empirical studies&lt;ref&gt;Lacohée, H., Cofta, P., Phippen, A., and Furnell, S. (2008) Understanding Public Perceptions: Trust and Engagement in ICT Mediated Services. International Engineering Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt; confirms the new approach to the traditional question regarding whether technology artefacts can be attributed with trust. Trust is not attributable to artefacts, but it is a representation of trust in social actors such as designers, creators and operators of technology. Properties of technological artefacts form a message&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bohmann | first1 = K | year = 1989 | title = About the Sense of Social Compatibility | url = | journal = [[AI &amp; Society]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 323–331 | doi=10.1007/bf01908622}}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine trustworthiness of those agents.

The discussion about the impact of information technologies is still in progress. However, a conceptual re-thinking of technology-mediated social groups,&lt;ref&gt;Willson, M. A. (2006) Technically Together: Rethinking Community within Techno-society. Peter Lang Publishing Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; or the proposition of a unifying socio-technical view on trust,&lt;ref&gt;Cofta, P. (2007). Trust, Complexity and Control: Confidence in a Convergent World. John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; from the perspective of social actors.

==Psychology==

In psychology, trust is believing that the person who is trusted will do what is expected. It starts at the family and grows to others. According to the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Erik Erikson]] development of basic trust is the [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|first state of psychosocial development]] occurring, or failing, during the first two years of life. Success results in feelings of security, trust, and optimism, while failure leads towards an orientation of insecurity and mistrust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Child Development Institute Parenting Today |url=http://www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/development/erickson.shtml |title=Stages of Social-Emotional Development In Children and Teenagers |publisher=Childdevelopmentinfo.com |accessdate=2013-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002220833/http://www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/development/erickson.shtml |archivedate=October 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly resulting in [[attachment disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fonagy, Peter. ''Attachment Theory and Psychoanalysis''. Other Press Professional, 2010. Print. {{ISBN|1590514602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person's dispositional tendency to trust others can be considered a [[personality trait]] and as such is one of the strongest predictors of [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref name=deneve&amp;cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M.|author2=Cooper, Harris |title=The Happy Personality: A Meta-Analysis of 137 Personality Traits and Subjective Well-Being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1998|volume=124|pages=197–229|url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y5_ID/personality/wellbeing/1998_Deneve_cooper_psych_bull.pdf|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197|pmid=9747186|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that trust increases subjective well-being because it enhances the quality of one's interpersonal relationships, and happy people are skilled at fostering good relationships.&lt;ref name=deneve1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M. |title=Happy as an Extraverted Clam? The Role of Personality for Subjective Well-Being |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |year=1999|volume=8|pages=141–144|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/8/5/141.abstract|issue=5|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trust is integral to the idea of [[social influence]]: it is easier to influence or persuade someone who is trusting. The notion of trust is increasingly adopted to predict acceptance of behaviors by others, [[Institutional trust|institution]]s (e.g. [[government agency|government agencies]]) and objects such as [[machine]]s. However, once again perception of honesty, competence and value similarity (slightly similar to benevolence) are essential. There are three different forms of trust. Trust is being vulnerable to someone even when they are trustworthy; trustworthiness are the characteristics or behaviors of one person that inspire positive expectations in another person, and trust propensity being able to rely on people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=main.showContent&amp;view=fulltext&amp;format=HTML&amp;id=2007-09571-002|title=PsycNET|website=Psycnet.apa.org|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once trust is lost, by obvious violation of one of these three determinants, it is very hard to regain. Thus there is clear asymmetry in the building versus destruction of trust. Hence being and acting trustworthy should be considered the only sure way to maintain a trust level.

Increasingly much research has been done on the notion of trust and its social implications:

* Barbara Misztal, in her book,&lt;ref name="BarbaraMisztal"&gt;Barbara Misztal, ''Trust in Modern Societies: The Search for the Bases of Social Order'', Polity Press, {{ISBN|0-7456-1634-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to combine all notions of trust together. She points out ''three basic things that trust does in the lives of people'': It makes social life ''predictable'', it creates a ''sense of [[community]]'', and it ''makes it easier for people to work together''.
* In the context of sexual trust Riki Robbins&lt;ref name="RikiRobbins"&gt;Riki Robbins, ''Betrayed!: How You Can Restore Sexual Trust and Rebuild Your Life'', Adams Media Corporation, {{ISBN|1-55850-848-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes four stages of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innerself.com/Relationships/Four_Stages_of_Trust.htm |title=Four stages of trust |publisher=Innerself.com |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the context of [[Information theory]] Ed Gerck defines and contrasts trust with social functions such as [[Power (philosophy)|power]], surveillance, and [[accountability]].&lt;ref name="Ed Gerck"&gt;Ed Gerck, ''Trust Points'', Digital Certificates: Applied Internet Security by J. Feghhi, J. Feghhi and P. Williams, Addison-Wesley, {{ISBN|0-201-30980-7}}, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ed Gerck |url=http://mcwg.org/mcg-mirror/trustdef.htm |title=Definition of trust |publisher=Mcwg.org |date=1998-01-23 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From a [[social identity]] perspective, the propensity to trust in strangers (see [[in-group favoritism]]) arises from the mutual knowledge of a shared group membership,&lt;ref name=Platow2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Platow |first1=M. J. |last2=Foddy |first2=M. |last3=Yamagishi |first3=T. |last4=Lim |first4=L. |last5=Chow |first5=A. |year=2012 |title=Two experimental tests of trust in in-group strangers: The moderating role of common knowledge of group membership |url=|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=42 |issue=|pages=30–35 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foddy2009"/&gt; stereotypes,&lt;ref name=Foddy2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Foddy |first1=M. |last2=Platow |first2=M.J. |last3=Yamagishi |first3=T. |year=2009 |title=Group-based trust in strangers: The role of stereotypes and expectations |url=|journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=|pages=419–422 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02312.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the need to maintain the group's positive distinctiveness.&lt;ref name="Tanis2005"/&gt;

In addition to the social influence, in organizational settings, trust may have a positive influence on the behaviors, perceptions, and [[performance]]s of a person. Trust has a circular relationship with [[organizational justice]] perceptions such that perceived justice leads to trust which, in turn, promotes future perceptions of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeConick | first1 = J. B. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of organizational justice, perceived organizational support, and perceived supervisor support on marketing employees' level of trust | url = | journal = Journal of Business Research | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 1349–1355 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor that enhances trust in a human being is facial resemblance. Through digital manipulation of facial resemblance in a two-person sequential trust game, supporting evidence was found that having similar [[facial feature]]s (facial resemblance) enhanced trust in a subject’s respective partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Facial resemblance enhances trust|author=Lisa M. DeBruine|date=7 July 2002|journal=Trust|doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2034|volume=269|pages=1307–1312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though facial resemblance was shown to increase trust, facial resemblance had the effect of decreased sexual desire in a particular partner. In a series of tests, digitally manipulated faces were presented to subjects to be evaluated for attractiveness within the context of a long term or short term relationship. The results showed that within the context of a short term relationship, which is dependent on sexual desire, similar facial features caused a decrease in said desire. Within the context of a long term relationship, which is dependent on trust, similar facial features increased the attractiveness of an individual, leading one to believe that facial resemblance and trust have great effects on relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeBruine|first=Lisa|title=Trustworthy but not lust-worthy: context-specific effects of facial resemblance|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|date=3 November 2005|volume=272|issue=1566|pages=919–22|jstor=30047623|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.3003|pmid=16024346|pmc=1564091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structure often creates trust in a person that encourages them to feel comfortable and excel in the workplace. Working anywhere may be [[Workplace stress|stress]]ful and takes effort. By having a conveniently organized area to work on, concentration will increase as well as effort. Structure is not just a method of order. It increases trust and therefore makes a workplace manageable. A structured, ordered environment produces trust as one may contain increased cooperation and perform on a higher level.

People may work together and achieve success through trust while working on projects that rely on each individual’s contribution.&lt;ref&gt;The Role of Trust in Organizational Settings, Kurt T. Dirks, Donald L. Ferrin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, where trust is absent, projects can fail, especially if this lack of trust has not been identified and addressed. This is one facet of [[VPEC-T]] analysis: This thinking framework is used when studying information systems. Identifying and dealing with cases where information providers, information users, and those responsible for processing information do not trust one another can result in the removal of a risk factor for a project.

One's social relationship characterized by low trust and norms that discourage academic engagement are expected to be associated with low academic achievement. Individuals that are in relationships characterized by high levels of social trust are more apt to openly exchange information and to act with caring benevolence toward one another than those in relationships lacking trust.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Roger.

An important key to treating [[sexual victimization]] of a child is the rebuilding of trust between parent and child.

===Social identity approach===
The [[social identity approach]] explains trust in strangers as a function of group-based stereotypes or [[ingroup favoritism|in-group favouring]] behaviours based on [[self-categorization theory|salient group memberships]]. With regard to ingroup favoritism, people generally think well of strangers but expect better treatment from in-group members in comparison to out-group members. This greater expectation then translates into a higher propensity to trust an in-group rather than out-group member.&lt;ref name="Platow2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanis2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foddy2008"/&gt; It has been pointed out that it is only advantageous to form such expectations of an in-group stranger if they too know the group membership of the recipient.&lt;ref name="Foddy2008"/&gt;

There is considerable empirical activity related to the social identity approach. Allocator studies have frequently been employed to understand group-based trust in strangers.&lt;ref name="Platow2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foddy2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Foddy2008&gt;Foddy, M., &amp; Dawes, R. (2008). Group-based trust in social dilemmas. In A. Biel, D. Eek, T. Garling, &amp; M. Gustafsson (Eds.), New Issues and Paradigms in Research on Social Dilemmas (pp. 57-85). New York, USA: Springer Science and Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guth2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guth | first1 = W. | last2 = Levati | first2 = M.V. | last3 = Ploner | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Social identity and trust – An experimental investigation | url = | journal = The Journal of Socio-Economics | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 1293–1308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be operationalised as unilateral or bilateral relationships of exchange. General social categories such as university affiliation, course majors, and even ad-hoc groups have been used to distinguish between in-group and out-group members. In unilateral studies of trust, the participant would be asked to choose between envelopes containing money that was previously allocated by an in-group or out-group member.&lt;ref name="Foddy2008"/&gt; They would have had no prior or future opportunities for interaction, simulating Brewer’s notion that group membership was sufficient in bringing about group-based trust and hence cooperation.&lt;ref name=Brewer1999&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = M.B. | year = 1999 | title = The psychology of prejudice: Ingroup love or outgroup hate? | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 429–444 | doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants could expect an amount ranging from nothing to the maximum value an allocator could give out. In bilateral studies of trust have employed an investment game devised by Berg and colleagues where individuals could choose to give a portion or none of their money to another.&lt;ref name=Berg1995&gt;Berg, J., Dickhaut, J., &amp; McCabe, K. (1995). Trust, reciprocity, and social history. Games and Economic Behaviour, 10, 122-142&lt;/ref&gt; Any amount given would be tripled and the receiver would then decide on whether they would return the favour by giving money back to the sender. Trusting behaviour on the part of the sender and the eventual trustworthiness of the receiver was exemplified through the giving of money.&lt;ref name=Tanis2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tanis |first1=M. |last2=Postmes |first2=T. |year=2005 |title=A social identity approach to trust: Interpersonal perception, group membership and trusting behaviour |url=|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=35 |issue=|pages=413–424 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foddy2008"/&gt;

The above empirical research has demonstrated that when group membership is made salient and known to both parties, trust is granted more readily to in-group members than out-group members.&lt;ref name="Foddy2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foddy2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guth2006"/&gt; This occurred even when the in-group stereotype was comparatively less positive than an out-group’s (e.g. psychology versus nursing majors),&lt;ref name="Foddy2009"/&gt; in the absence of personal identity cues,&lt;ref name="Tanis2005"/&gt; and when participants had the option of a sure sum of money (i.e. in essence opting out of the need to trust a stranger).&lt;ref name="Platow2012"/&gt; In contrast, when only the recipient was made aware of group membership trust becomes reliant upon group stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Foddy2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanis2005"/&gt; The group with the more positive stereotype was trusted (e.g. one’s university affiliation over another),&lt;ref name="Tanis2005"/&gt; even over that of the in-group (e.g. nursing over psychology majors).&lt;ref name="Foddy2009"/&gt; Another reason for in-group favouring behaviours in trust could be attributed to the need to maintain in-group [[Social identity theory#Positive distinctiveness|positive distinctiveness]], particularly in the presence of social identity threat.&lt;ref name="Guth2006"/&gt; It should also be noted that trust in out-group strangers increased when personal cues to identity were revealed.&lt;ref name="Tanis2005"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Some philosophers argue that trust is more than a relationship of reliance. Philosophers such as Annette Baier have made a difference between trust and reliance by saying that trust can be betrayed, whilst reliance can only be disappointed (Baier 1986, 235).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baier, Annette|date=1986|title=Trust and Antitrust|journal=Ethics|volume=96 | issue = 2 |pages=231–260|jstor=2381376|doi=10.1086/292745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn McLeod explains Baier's argument by giving the following examples: we can rely on our clock to give the time, but we do not feel betrayed when it breaks, thus, we cannot say that we trusted it; we are not trusting when we are suspicious of the other person, because this is in fact an expression of distrust (McLeod 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entriesrust/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Carolyn|last=McLeod|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=29 October 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=29 October 2017|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, trust is different from reliance in the sense that a truster accepts the risk of being betrayed.

The definition of trust as a belief in something or a confident expectation about something&lt;ref&gt;"trust." Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. 25 May. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; leads to eliminate the notion of risk from the definition, because it does not include whether the expectation or belief is favorable or unfavorable. For example, to have an expectation of a friend arriving to dinner late because she has habitually arrived late for the last fifteen years, is a confident expectation (whether or not we agree with her annoying late arrivals.) The trust is not about what we wish for, rather it is in the consistency of the data of our habits. As a result, there is no risk or betrayal because the data now exists as collective knowledge.

==Economics==
{{see also|Consumer confidence}}
Trust in economics is treated as an explanation for a difference between actual human behaviour and the one that can be explained by the individual desire to maximize one's utility. In economic terms, trust can provide an explanation of a difference between [[Nash equilibrium]] and the observed equilibrium. Such an approach can be applied to individuals as well as societies.

Trust is also seen as an economic lubricant, reducing the cost of transactions between parties, enabling new forms of cooperation and generally furthering business activities;&lt;ref name="Morgan 20–38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Robert|author2=Hunt, S. |authorlink2=Shelby D. Hunt |title=The Commitment-Trust Theory of Relationship Marketing|journal=The Journal of Marketing|date=July 1994|volume=58|issue=3|pages=20–38|doi=10.2307/1252308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zheng, J.|author2=Roehrich, J.K.|author3=Lewis, M.A.|date=2008|title=The dynamics of contractual and relational governance: Evidence from long-term public-private procurement arrangements|journal=Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management|volume=14 | issue = 1 |pages=43–54|url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-41049112855&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=yXIvJQ7AsPq0YyDQfJmJLCa%3a2|doi=10.1016/j.pursup.2008.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; employment and prosperity. This observation &lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, F. (1996) Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity, Touchstone Books.&lt;/ref&gt; created a significant interest in considering trust as a form of [[social capital]] and has led research into closer understanding of the process of creation and distribution of such capital. It has been claimed that higher level of social trust is positively correlated with economic development. Even though the original concept of 'high trust' and 'low trust' societies may not necessarily hold, it has been widely accepted and demonstrated that social trust benefits the economy &lt;ref&gt;Zak, P. J., and Knack, S. (2001) Trust and growth. Economic Journal,111: [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2667866 295]-321.&lt;/ref&gt; and that a low level of trust inhibits economic growth.

Theoretical economical modelling &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braynov | first1 = S. | last2 = Sandholm | first2 = T. | year = 2002 | title = Contracting With Uncertain Level Of Trust | url = | journal = Computational Intelligence | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 501–514 | doi=10.1111/1467-8640.00200}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that the optimum level of trust that a rational economic agent should exhibit in transactions is equal to trustworthiness of the other party. Such a level of trust leads to efficient market. Trusting less lead to the loss of economic opportunities, trusting more leads to unnecessary vulnerabilities and potential exploitation.

Economics is also interested in quantifying trust, usually in monetary terms. The level of correlation between increase in [[profit margin]] &lt;ref&gt;Resnick, P. (2006) The value of reputation on eBay: a controlled experiment. Experimental Economics, volume 9, Issue 2, Jun 2006, Page 79-101.&lt;/ref&gt; or decrease in transactional cost can be used as indicators of economic value of trust.

Economic 'trust games' are popularly used to empirically quantify trust in relationships under laboratory conditions. There are several games and game-like scenarios related to trust that have been tried, with certain preferences to those that allow to estimate confidence in monetary terms.&lt;ref&gt;Keser, C. (2003) Experimental games for the design of reputation management systems. IBM Systems J., vol. 42, no. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Games of trust are designed in a way that their Nash equilibrium differ from Pareto optimum so that no player alone can maximise his own utility by altering his selfish strategy without cooperation while cooperating partners can benefit.

The classical version of the game of trust has been described in &lt;ref&gt;Berg, J., Dickhaut, J., and McCabe, K. (1995) Trust, Reciprocity, and Social History, Games and Economic Behavior 10, 122–142. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WFW-45NJFPR-14&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=07/31/1995&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=49474c64b2d97b84891f6009445ffd76&amp;searchtype=a Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; as an abstracted investment game, using the scenario of an investor and a broker. Investor can invest a fraction of his money, and broker can return only part of his gains. If both players follow their economical best interest, the investor should never invest and the broker will never be able to re-pay anything. Thus the flow of money flow, its volume and character is attributable entirely to the existence of trust.

The game can be played as one-off, or as a repetitive one, between the same or different sets of players, to distinguish between a general propensity to trust and trust within particular relationships. Several other variants of this game exist. Reversing rules lead to the game of distrust, pre-declarations can be used to establish intentions of players,&lt;ref&gt;Airiau, S., and Sen, S. (2006) Learning to Commit in Repeated Games. In: Proc. of the Fifth Int. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS06).&lt;/ref&gt; while alterations to the distribution of gains can be used to manipulate perception of both players. The game can be also played by several players on the closed market,&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. E., Katok, E., and Ockenfels, A. (2003) How Effective are Electronic Reputation Mechanisms? An Experimental Investigation.&lt;/ref&gt; with or without information about reputation.

Other interesting games are e.g. binary-choice trust games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Camerer | first1 = C. | last2 = Weigelt | first2 = K. | year = 1988 | title = Experimental Tests of a Sequential Equilibrium Reputation Model | url = | journal = Econometrica | volume = 56 | issue = 1| pages = 1–36 | doi=10.2307/1911840| citeseerx = 10.1.1.458.4383 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the gift-exchange game &lt;ref&gt;Fehr, E., Kirchsteiger, G., and Riedl, A. (1993) Does Fairness Prevent Market Clearing? An Experimental Investigation. Quarterly Journal of Economics 108(May), pp. 437-60.&lt;/ref&gt; and various other forms of social games. Specifically games based on the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] &lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, W. (1992) Prisoner's Dilemma. Doubleday, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; are popularly used to link trust with economic utility and demonstrate the rationality behind reciprocity.

The work of [[Rachel Botsman]] is also very important about collaboration economy.

The popularisation of [[e-commerce]] opened the discussion of trust in economy to new challenges while at the same time elevating the importance of trust, and desire to understand customer decision to trust.&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, D., H., Chervany, N. L. (2001) Conceptualizing Trust: A Typology and E-Commerce Customer Relationships Model. Proc. of the 34th Hawaii Int. Conf. on System Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, inter-personal relationship between the buyer and the seller has been dis-intermediated by the technology,&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, A. (1991) Modernity and Self-identity: Self and Society in the Late Modern Age. Polity Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and had to be improved upon.&lt;ref&gt;Golbeck, J. (2008). Computing with Social Trust. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, web sites could be made to convince the buyer to trust the seller, regardless of seller's actual trustworthiness (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Egger, F. N. From Interactions to Transactions: Designing the Trust Experience for Business-to-Consumer Electronic Commerce. PhD Thesis, Eindhoven University of Technology (The Netherlands).&lt;/ref&gt;) . Reputation-based systems improved on trust assessment by allowing to capture the collective perception of trustworthiness, generating significant interest in various models of reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, E., Dillion, T., Hussain, F. K. (2006) Trust and Reputation for Service-Oriented Environments: Technologies for Building Business Intelligence and Consumer Confidence. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems==
In [[systems]], a trusted component has a set of properties which another component can rely on. If A trusts B, this means that a violation in those properties of B might compromise the correct operation of A. Observe that those properties of B trusted by A might not correspond quantitatively or qualitatively to B’s actual properties. This happens when the designer of the overall system does not take the relation into account. In consequence, trust should be placed to the extent of the component’s trustworthiness. The trustworthiness of a component is thus, not surprisingly, defined by how well it secures a set of functional and non-functional properties, deriving from its architecture, construction, and environment, and evaluated as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Women's Party''' (''Arnat Partiiat'') was a feminist [[political party]] in [[Greenland]].  At the 2002 [[legislative]] [[elections in Greenland|elections]] the party won 2.4% of the popular vote and no seats.  On November 6, 1999, in response to the still much lower representation of women in politics, a group of women formed the party. Several members ran for the parliamentary election in 2002. The Women's Party was in short of votes. The party was dissolved in the spring of 2008.
