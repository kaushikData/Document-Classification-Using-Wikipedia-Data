[[File:Tarte.tatin.wmt.jpg|thumb|''[[Tarte Tatin]]'', a French variation on apple pie]]

An '''apple pie''' is a [[pie]] or a [[tart]], in which the principal filling ingredient is [[apple]]. It is, on occasion, served with [[whipped cream]] or [[ice cream]] on top, (which is known as apple pie a la mode), or with [[cheddar cheese]].&lt;ref name=Atlas&gt;{{cite news |last1=Waters |first1=Michael |title=The Long, Storied Controversy Over Cheese on Apple Pie |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/cheese-apple-pie |accessdate=11 June 2018 |work=Atlas Obscura |date=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pastry is generally used top-and-bottom, making it a double-crust pie; the upper crust may be a circular or a pastry lattice woven of crosswise strips. Depending on the baker's preference, the bottom of the double-crust may be baked first (before baking the whole pie) to prevent the bottom from getting soggy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factslegend.org/20-facts-apple-pie/|title=20 Interesting Facts About Apple Pie|website=factslegend.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are deep-dish apple pie, with a top crust only, and open-face [[Tarte Tatin]]. Apple pie is an unofficial [[National symbols of the United States|symbol of the United States]] and one of its signature [[comfort foods]].&lt;ref name=Pinch /&gt;

==Ingredients==

Apple pie can be made with many different sorts of apples. The more popular cooking apples include, [[Braeburn]], [[Gala (apple)|Gala]], [[Cortland (apple)|Cortland]], [[Bramley (apple)|Bramley]], [[Empire (apple)|Empire]], [[Northern Spy]], [[Granny Smith]], and [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Best Apples for Apple Pie|url = http://www.stemilt.com/blog/tips/best-apples-for-apple-pie/|website = Farm Blog {{!}} The Stemilt Blog|date = 2015-09-28|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fruit for the pie can be fresh, canned, or reconstituted from [[dried fruit|dried apple]]s. These different types of apples (canned, dried, fresh) affects the final texture and the length of cooking time required will vary, therefore people disagree{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} on if it affects the flavour or not. Dried or preserved apples were originally substituted only at times when fresh [[fruit]] was unavailable. Along with the apples people commonly use, cinnamon, salt, butter, and most importantly sugar.&lt;ref name="foodnetwork.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/apple-pie-recipe.html|title=Apple Pie|website=Food Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most of the old recipes don't include sugar due to the price or having a better sweetener option, most people definitely use it today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfile.org/7-facts-about-apple-pie|title=7 Facts about Apple Pie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apple pie is often served in the style of ''"[[Pie à la Mode|à la Mode]]"'' (topped with [[ice cream]]). Alternatively, a piece of [[sharp cheddar]] cheese is, at times, placed on top of or alongside a slice of the finished pie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thekitchn.com/an-apple-pie-without-the-chees-99573|title=An apple pie without the cheese |publisher= 2012 Apartment Therapy |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ochef.com/r125.htm | title = Apple Pie | publisher = OChef | accessdate = 2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hungermountain.coop/OurCommunity/News/tabid/148/entryid/177/Default.aspx | title = Product Highlight: Apple Pie, Sharp Cheddar, and A Nice Cup of Coffee | publisher= Hunger Mountain Coop | accessdate = 2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple pie with cheddar is popular in the [[American Midwest]] and [[New England]], particularly in [[Vermont]], where it is considered the [[List of U.S. state foods|state dish]].&lt;ref name=Atlas /&gt;

==Dutch style==
Recipes for Dutch apple pie go back to the [[Middle Ages]]. An early Dutch [[cookbook]] from 1514, ''Een notabel boecxken van cokeryen'' ("A notable little cookery book"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kookhistorie.nl/NBC/index_nbc.htm |title=Home Notabel Boecxken van Cokeryen door Thomas vander Noot (1514) |publisher=Kookhistorie.nl |date=2002-08-13 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; documents a recipe for ''Appeltaerten'' (compare modern Dutch [[wikt:appeltaart|''Appeltaarten'']] "apple pies"). This early recipe was a simple one, requiring only a standard pie crust, slices of especially soft apples with their skin and seeds removed, and ''den selven deeghe daer die taerte af ghemaect es'' (roughly meaning "the same dough that the pie [crust] is made of") to fill in the top. It was then baked in a typical [[Dutch oven]]. Once baked, the top crust (except at the edges) would be cut out from the middle, after which the apple slices were potentially put through a [[sieve]] before the pie was stirred with a wooden spoon. At this point the book recommends adding several [[spice]]s to the pie, namely: [[cardamom]], [[ginger]], [[cinnamon]], [[nutmeg]], [[clove]], [[Mace (spice)|mace]] and [[powdered sugar]]. Finally, after mixing the ingredients into the pie with [[cream]], it is once again put into the oven to dry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_not001nota01_01/_not001nota01_01_0003.php Een notabel boecxken van cokeryen - 123 Appeltaerten.], ''[http://dbnl.org dbnl.org]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[Dutch cuisine|Dutch]] apple pie comes in two varieties, a crumb (''appelkruimeltaart'') and a lattice (''appeltaart'') style pie. Both recipes are distinct in that they typically call for flavourings of [[cinnamon]] and [[lemon juice]] to be added and differ in texture, not taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recipestap.com/more-apple-cakes-hollandse-appeltaart-aka-dutch-apple-tart |title=Recipe: More apple cakes: Hollandse appeltaart aka Dutch Apple Tart |publisher=Recipes Tap |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012012659/http://www.recipestap.com/more-apple-cakes-hollandse-appeltaart-aka-dutch-apple-tart |archivedate=12 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stemilt.com/stem-blog/dutch-apple-pie/|title=Dutch Apple Pie {{!}} Stemilt|date=2016-10-17|newspaper=Stemilt|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch apple pies may include ingredients such as full-cream butter, raisins and [[almond paste]], in addition to ingredients such as apples and sugar, which they have in common with other recipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kookhistorie.nl/images/vk-scan/vk-c3r.jpg |title=page 21 "De verstandige kock of sorghvuldige huyshoudster (anno 1669)" |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of Dutch apple pie is a crust on the bottom and around the edges. This crust is then filled with pieces or slices of apple, usually a crisp and mildly tart variety such as Goudreinet or [[Elstar]]. Cinnamon and [[sugar]] are generally mixed in with the apple filling. Atop the filling, strands of [[dough]] cover the pie in a [[Lattice (pastry)|lattice]] holding the filling in place but keeping it visible or cover the pie with crumbs. It can be eaten warm or cold, sometimes with a dash of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. In the US, "Dutch apple pie" refers specifically to the apple pie style with a crumb, [[streusel]], topping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stemilt.com/stem-blog/dutch-apple-pie/|title=Dutch Apple Pie {{!}} Stemilt|date=2016-10-17|newspaper=Stemilt|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.browneyedbaker.com/2010/09/15/dutch-apple-pie/ |title=Dutch Apple Pie |publisher=Brown Eyed Baker |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English style==

[[File:For to Make Tartys in Applis (1381).gif|right|thumb|"For to Make Tartys in Applis", 18th-century print of a 14th-century recipe]]
English apple pie recipes go back to the time of [[Chaucer]]. The 1381 recipe (see illustration at right) lists the ingredients as ''good [[apple]]s, good [[spice]]s, [[ficus|fig]]s, [[raisin]]s and [[pear]]s.'' The ''cofyn'' of the recipe is a casing of pastry. [[Saffron]] is used for colouring the pie filling. Today, the English style incorporates generous layers of sweetened slices of, usually, Bramley apple; layered into a dome shape to allow for downward shrinkage, and thus avoid a saggy middle, then topped with butter or lard shortcrust pastry, and baked until the apple filling is cooked.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In English-speaking countries, apple pie, often classified as a satisfying 'comfort' food, is a dessert of enduring popularity, whether it's eaten hot or cold, on its own or with [[ice cream]], [[cream|double cream]], or [[custard]].

== French style ==

[[French cuisine|French]] style apple pie is very different compared to the American version of the sweet dessert. Instead of it being right side up with crust on top and bottom, it actually is upside down, with the fruit being caramelized. This can be made not only with apples but other fruits or vegetables as well, for example, pears or tomatoes.
''see [[Tarte Tatin]]''

==Swedish style==
The [[Swedish cuisine|Swedish]] style apple pie is predominantly a variety of apple [[crumble]], rather than a traditional pastry pie. Often, breadcrumbs are used (wholly or partially) instead of flour, and sometimes rolled oats. It is usually flavoured with cinnamon and served with vanilla [[custard]] or ice cream. There is also a very popular version called ''äppelkaka'' (apple cake), which differs from the pie in that it is a [[sponge cake]] baked with fresh apple pieces in it.

Apple pie was brought to the colonies by the [[British people|British]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], and [[Swedes]] during the 17th and 18th centuries. The apple pie had to wait for the planting of European varieties, brought across the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]], to become fruit-bearing apple trees, to be selected for their cooking qualities as there were no native apples except [[crabapple]]s, which yield very small and sour fruit.&lt;ref name=app&gt;{{cite web

Apple pie was a common food in 18th-century [[Delaware]]. As noted by the New Sweden historian Dr. [[Israel Acrelius]] in a letter: "Apple pie is used throughout the whole year, and when fresh Apples are no longer to be had, dried ones are used. It is the evening meal of children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stradley|first=Linda|title=Apple Pie - History of Apple Pie|url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PieHistory/ApplePie.htm|work=What's Cooking America.net|accessdate=2 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110610202255/http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PieHistory/ApplePie.htm| archivedate= 10 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mock apple pie, made from [[cracker (food)|crackers]], was probably invented for use aboard ships, as it was known to the British Royal Navy as early as 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Naval Chronicle|date=1812|volume=28|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K085AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22mock+apple%22|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known published recipes for mock apple pie date from the antebellum period of the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bliss|title=Practical Cook Book: Containing Upwards of One Thousand Receipts…|date=1850|publisher=Lippincott, Grambo|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9loEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Godey's Magazine|date=1854|volume=48-49|page=378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e8hZAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22mock+apple+pie%22|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1930s, and for many years afterwards, [[Ritz Crackers]] promoted a recipe for mock apple pie using its product, along with sugar and various spices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Beth|last=Kracklauer  |url=http://www.saveur.com/article/Kitchen/Putting-on-the-Ritz |title=Putting on the Ritz |publisher=Saveur.com |date=2008-02-28 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although eaten in Europe since long before the [[European colonization of the Americas]], apple pie as used in the phrase "as American as apple pie" describes something as being "typically American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/american-food-dishes/index.html|title=American food: The 50 greatest dishes|date=2017-07-12|work=CNN Travel|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;" "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/as-american-as-apple-pie| title=Definition of "as American as apple pie"| journal= Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus| author=Cambridge University Press| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, apple pie became a symbol of American prosperity and national pride. A newspaper article published in 1902 declared that "No pie-eating people can be permanently vanquished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Popular Apple Sayings|url=http://usapple.org/consumers/all-about-apples/history-and-folklore/popular-apple-sayings|publisher=U.S. Apple Association|accessdate=2 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701035054/http://usapple.org/consumers/all-about-apples/history-and-folklore/popular-apple-sayings|archivedate=1 July 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dish was also commemorated in the phrase "for Mom and apple pie" - supposedly the stock answer of American soldiers in [[World War II]], whenever journalists asked why they were going to war. Jack Holden and Frances Kay sang in their patriotic 1950 song ''The Fiery Bear'', creating contrast between this symbol of U.S. culture and the [[Russian bear]] of the [[Soviet Union]]:

:We love our baseball and apple pie
:We love our county fair
:We'll keep Old Glory waving high
:There's no place here for a bear

Advertisers exploited the patriotic connection in the 1970s with the commercial jingle "[[baseball]], [[hot dog]]s, apple pie and [[Chevrolet]]".

Modern American recipes for apple pie usually indicate a [[pastry]] that is 9 inches in diameter in a fluted pie plate, with an apple filling spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice, and it may or may not have a lattice or shapes cut out of the top for decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McBride-Carlton|first1=Jan|title=The Old Fashioned Cookbook |date=1975 |publisher=Vineyard Books|isbn=0030146216|page=286|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; One out of five Americans surveyed (19%) prefer apple pie over all others, followed by pumpkin (13%)
and pecan (12%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.piecouncil.org/pdf/Pie_Fun_Facts.pdf |title=Fun facts |website=piecouncil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unincorporated community of [[Pie Town, New Mexico]] is named after apple pie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pietown.com/ |title=Pie Town New Mexico |publisher=Pietown.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aquarium furniture''' refers to the various ornaments and functional items in an [[aquarium]].

Ornamental aquarium furniture is often [[kitsch]]: popular examples include [[ceramic]] [[mermaid]]s, 'sunken' [[ship]]s and [[castle]]s, and the ever-popular (but curiously misplaced) "No Fishing" [[Information sign|sign]]. Another strange piece of decor is the ubiquitous plastic [[coral]]s found often in [[Fresh water|freshwater]] tanks. (Corals are exclusively found in saltwater.)

Examples of functional aquarium furniture would include devices for removing [[algae]] from the glass (either a [[razor]] or a scouring pad, attached to the glass by a [[magnet]]), [[airstone]]s, [[water filter]]s, water heaters, and food dispensers.

Aquarium furniture may also refer to an item of (regular) [[furniture]] that features an aquarium in its design. A stand or [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] that supports the aquarium may be considered aquarium furniture. Also, many home reef aquariums canopies containing [[Metal-halide lamp|metal halide lights]]. The canopies are often constructed to the same standards as high quality [[Cabinet making|cabinetry]].

[[File:Marmitako.JPG|thumb|A dish of [[marmitako]] in [[Thunnus alalunga|bonito]] variety]]

'''Basque cuisine''' refers to the cuisine of the Basque Country and includes meats and fish grilled over hot coals, [[marmitako]] and [[stew|lamb stews]], [[cod]], [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]] bean dishes, [[paprika]]s from [[Lekeitio]], [[pintxo]]s (Basque [[tapas]]), [[Idiazábal cheese|Idiazabal sheep's cheese]], [[txakoli]] sparkling wine, and [[Sagardotegi|Basque cider]].

A '''basquaise''' is a type of dish prepared in the style of Basque cuisine that often includes [[tomato]]es and sweet or hot red [[capsicum|pepper]]s.

==Overview==
[[File:Pinchos txaka bonito.jpg|thumb|The traditional ''[[pintxo]]s'']]

Basque cuisine is influenced by the abundance of produce from the sea on one side and the fertile [[Ebro]] valley on the other. The  great mountainous nature of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] has led to a difference between coastal cuisine dominated by fish and seafood, and inland cuisine with fresh and cured meats, many vegetables and legumes, and freshwater fish and [[salt cod]]. The French and Spanish influence is strong also, with a noted difference between the cuisine of either side of the modern border; even iconic Basque dishes and products, such as txakoli from the South, or [[Gâteau Basque]] (Biskotx) and [[Jambon de Bayonne]] from [[Iparralde|the North]], are rarely seen on the other side.

Basques have also been quick to absorb new ingredients and techniques from new settlers and from their own trade and exploration links. [[Jew]]s expelled from Spain and [[Portugal]] created a chocolate and confectionery industry in [[Bayonne]] still well-known today, and part of a wider confectionery and pastry tradition across the Basque Country. Basques embraced the [[potato]] and the [[capsicum]], used in hams, sausages and recipes, with pepper festivals around the area, notably [[Ezpeleta]] and [[Puente la Reina]].

[[Olive oil]] is more commonly used than [[vegetable oil]] in Basque cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Fillmore |first=Colleen R. Asumendi |title=Basques of Boise: Adult dietary culture and tradition |type=Ph.D. |year=2005 |publisher=[[University of Idaho]] |page=56 |oclc=68571142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuisine and the kitchen are at the heart of Basque culture, and there is a Museum of Gastronomy in [[Llodio]].

One of the staple cookbooks for traditional Basque dishes was initially published in 1933. "La cocina de Nicolasa" (the Kitchen of Nicolasa) by [[Nicolasa Pradera]] has gone into 20 editions.&lt;ref name=Markina-Xemein&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicolasa Pradera (1870-1959)|url=http://www.markina-xemein.com/es-ES/Turismo/Historia/Paginas/NicolasaPradera.aspx|website=Markina-Xemein|publisher=Markina-Xemein Town Hall|accessdate=25 September 2015|location=Markina-Xemein, Spain|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ways of eating===
In addition to the dishes and products of the Basque Country, there are features of the way of preparing and sharing food unique to the area.

Cider houses ([[sagardotegi]]ak) are a feature of the hills around [[San Sebastián|Donostia]], especially near [[Astigarraga]]. These are usually large country restaurants with enormous barrels of cider. Cider is poured from a height straight into the glass for visitors, with a rustic menu invariably of salt cod [[omelette]], grilled [[T-bone steak]] and ewes' milk cheese with [[walnut]]s and [[quince]] paste. The cider houses are only open for a few months of the year.

The ''txikiteo'' is the tapas crawl from bar to bar seen across Spain, but it reaches its pinnacle in [[San Sebastián|Donostia]], with hundreds of people on the streets of the old town wandering from bar to bar, each known for its specialty, whether it be [[croquette]]s, [[Tortilla de patatas|tortilla]], toast, or seafood. The txikiteo is also popular in cities such as [[Pamplona]] and [[Bilbao]].

''Gerezi beltza arno gorriakin''&lt;ref name=Hirigoyen&gt;{{cite book |last=Hirigoyen |first=Gerald |author2=Cameron Hirigoyen |title=The Basque kitchen:  Tempting food from the Pyrenees |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers, Inc |location=New York |language= |isbn=0-06-757461-0 |page=262 |year=1999 }}, page 214&lt;/ref&gt; is a cherry soup served warm or cold. The cherries are [[Poaching (cooking)|poached]] in [[wine]], often with enough [[sugar]] added to make a light [[syrup]]. A cherry without pits is preferred for this dish. To release their flavor, the cherries are carefully [[cherry pitter|pitted]] or cut in half. Usually the soup is prepared on the day it will be served, because 24 hours is enough time for the cherries to blanch noticeably in the liquid. The soup is often served with a dollop of [[sour cream]], [[crème fraîche]], or [[ice cream]].

Gastronomic societies are organisations, almost always of men, who cook and eat together in a communal [[txoko]]. In large cities, the society's premises can be large and formally organised, but the ''txoko'' is frequently a small space owned by a group of friends in smaller towns and suburbs, where food and costs are shared. The first txoko was noted in Donostia in 1870. This unique feature of the Spanish [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] enables men to participate in the cooking process and spend time together away from the traditionally formidable matriarchs (''etxekoandreak''). In recent years, women have been allowed into some clubs.

===New Basque Cuisine===
In the 1970s and 1980s Basque chefs were influenced by the ''[[nouvelle cuisine]]'' of France and created the ''nouvelle cuisine basque'', radically original in its form but solidly Basque in substance, with lighter and less rustic versions of traditional dishes and flavours. The first Spanish restaurant to be awarded 3 stars in the Michelin Guide was, in fact, ''Zalacaín'', a Basque restaurant, although located in Madrid. [[Juan Mari Arzak]] in Donostia became the most famous exponent and one of the first three-star [[Michelin Guide]] restaurants in Spain.
In a few years the movement swept across Spain, becoming the state's default [[haute cuisine]]. Many tapas bars, especially in San Sebastián, serve modern-style ''pintxos'' employing novel techniques and ingredients. In more recent years, young chefs, such as [[Martin Berasategui]], have given new impetus to Basque cuisine.

===International Basque cuisine===
Basque cuisine has continued to have an influence on international cuisine, particularly in Spain and France where it is highly regarded. [[Catalan people|Catalan]] chef [[Ferran Adrià]] has taken the techniques pioneered by Arzak and other Basque chefs to new heights. [[Karlos Arguiñano]] has popularised Basque cuisine in Spain through TV and books. Teresa Barrenechea was among the first people to bring traditional Basque cuisine to America with her first restaurant Marichu in Bronxville in 1991, where she hired Chef Joseba Encabo to set up, develop the menus and run the restaurant till soon later he was offered a position as faculty at the [[Culinary Institute of America]] in [[Hyde Park, New York]]. Teresa Barrenechea and husband Raynold von Samson continued to promote Basque cuisine in America by opening their second Marichu restaurant in Manhattan in 1994, which was close to the United Nations Headquarters. Teresa Barrenechea has written two books, ''The Basque Table'' (Harvard Common Press, Boston 1998) and ''The Cuisines of Spain'' (Ten Speed, Berkley 2005). Teresa Barrenechea is the holder of two awards: Premio Nacional de Gastronomía&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realacademiadegastronomia.com/premios_dentro.php?categoria=6|title=Real Academia de Gastronomía. Premios|publisher=|access-date=2014-04-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418220630/http://www.realacademiadegastronomia.com/premios_dentro.php?categoria=6|archive-date=2014-04-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (National Prize of Gastronomy, the highest culinary award given by the Spanish Administration) and Best Regional Cuisine Book at the 5th World Cookbook Fair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookbookfair.com/index.php/component/search/?searchword=teresa%20barrenechea&amp;searchphrase=all&amp;Itemid=101|title=Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Périgueux]] (France).  At the other end of the scale, Basque-style [[pincho|pintxos]] bars are common in [[Barcelona]] and [[Madrid]]. In cities where large numbers of Basque people emigrated, such as [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]; [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], [[Boise]], [[Idaho]]; [[Fresno]], [[California]], and [[Bakersfield]], [[California]], there are several Basque restaurants and a noted Basque influence on the local cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.buber.net/Basque/Food/charley.html | title=Basque Restaurants of the United States | publisher=Buber.net | accessdate=20 November 2014 | author=Shaffer, Charles L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28684">'''Celebratory gunfire''' (also called '''aerial firing''' or '''happy fire''') is the shooting of a [[firearm]] into the air in celebration.  It is culturally accepted in parts of the [[Balkans]], the [[Middle East]], the Central Asian region of [[Afghanistan]], and the South Asian region of [[Pakistan]].  In regions such as [[Puerto Rico]] and continental areas of the [[United States]] it is practiced illegally, especially on holidays like New Year's Eve.&lt;ref name="dawn"/&gt;

Common occasions for celebratory gunfire include [[New Year's Day]] as well as religious holidays such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]].&lt;ref name=SETimes/&gt; The practice may result in random death and injury from [[stray bullet]]s. Property damage is sometimes another result of celebratory gunfire; shattered windows and damaged roofs are often found after such celebrations.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;

==Falling-bullet injuries==
[[Image:Telop-mkd.jpg|thumb|right|"Bullets are not greeting cards. Celebrate without firearms." From the IANSA Macedonian poster campaign, December 2005]]
Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with [[terminal velocity|terminal velocities]] much lower than their [[muzzle velocity]] when they leave the barrel of a firearm.  Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground.  Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its [[Trajectory of a projectile|angular ballistic trajectory]] and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in [[free fall]].

A study by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found that 80% of celebratory gunfire-related injuries are to the head, feet, and shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a2.htm |title=New Year's Eve Injuries Caused by Celebratory Gunfire --- Puerto Rico, 2003 |accessdate=2007-07-31 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Puerto Rico]], about two people die and about 25 more are injured each year from celebratory gunfire on New Year's Eve, the CDC says.&lt;ref name=Abdul-Alim/&gt; Between the years 1985 and 1992, doctors at the [[King/Drew Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], treated some 118 people for random falling-bullet injuries.

Firearms expert [[Julian Hatcher]] studied falling bullets in the 1920s and calculated that .30 [[caliber]] rounds reach terminal velocities of &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;90&amp;nbsp;m/s&amp;nbsp;(300&amp;nbsp;feet per second or 186&amp;nbsp;miles per hour)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hatcher, Julian Sommerville|title=Hatcher's Notebook |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |year= 1962|isbn=0-8117-0795-4|page= 514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[International Action Network on Small Arms]] (IANSA) ran education campaigns on the dangers of celebratory gunfire in [[Serbia and Montenegro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In Serbia, the campaign slogan was "every bullet that is fired up, must come down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/12/C00FD2BC-CD6E-4774-A127-F38C1133CC4F.html |title=Serbs Told To Keep Guns Quiet On New Year's Eve – RADIO FREE EUROPE / RADIO LIBERTY |accessdate=2007-08-01 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property damage==
Bullets often lodge in [[roof]]s, causing minor damage that requires repair in most cases. Normally, the bullet will penetrate the roof surface through to the roof deck, leaving a hole where water may run into the building and cause a leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsboadvertisingservice.com/library1.htm#BULLETS |title=Professionals Topics Library : Roofs &amp; Bullets |accessdate=2007-08-02 |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817004232/http://www.fsboadvertisingservice.com/library1.htm#BULLETS |archivedate=2007-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The number of complaints regarding random shooting in [[Dallas, Texas]], on New Year's Eve declined from approximately 1,000 in 1999 to 800 each in 2001 and 2002.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;
*In early 2008, increased partisanship in [[Lebanon]] led to the practice of firing celebratory gunfire in support when politicians appeared on local television, leading to multiple deaths and to calls from these leaders to end the practice.&lt;ref name=Fallout/&gt;

==Notable incidents==
&lt;!-- Notable incidents should involve either multiple fatalities, tracing the bullet to the shooter, change in policy or procedure, or some other form of notability above and beyond a random injury. --&gt;

[[Special-effects]] experts [[Adam Savage]] and [[Jamie Hyneman]] conducted a series of experiments to answer the question: "Can celebratory gunfire kill when the bullets fall back to earth?"

Using [[pig]] carcasses, they worked out the terminal velocity of a falling bullet and had a mixed result, answering the question with all three of the show's possible outcomes: Confirmed, Plausible and Busted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode_06.html |title=Discovery Channel :: Mythbusters: Episode Guide |accessdate=2007-07-31 |work=StarPhoenix |publisher=CanWest Interactive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823212625/http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode_06.html |archivedate=2007-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They tested falling bullets by firing them from both a [[handgun]] and a [[rifle]], by firing them from an [[air gun]] designed to propel them at terminal velocity, and by dropping them in the desert from an instrumented balloon.

They found that while bullets traveling on a perfectly vertical trajectory tumble on the way down, creating turbulence that reduces terminal velocity below that which would kill, it was very difficult to fire a bullet in a near-ideal vertical trajectory. In practice, bullets were likely to remain spin-stabilized on a ballistic trajectory and fall at a potentially lethal terminal velocity. They also verified cases of actual deaths from falling bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2006/04/episode_50_bullets_fired_up_vo_1.html |title=Annotated Mythbusters: Episode 50: Bullets Fired Up, Vodka Myths III |accessdate=2007-08-01 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Court Theatre of Buda''' (natively Várszínház) is [[Hungary]]'s oldest functioning, and [[Budapest]]'s first theatre. It was built in 1763 as a [[Carmelite]] church and monastery, and was converted to a theatre in 1787. The theatre was home to the first play in Hungarian language in 1790.

==History==
[[File:Court theatre buda old.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The Court Theatre of Buda in the 18th century]]
In the Middle Ages, the area was occupied by a Franciscan temple devoted to St. John, built between 1269-70. The building was converted to a mosque during the [[Ottoman Hungary|Turkish occupation]], and was destroyed in the [[Battle of Buda (1686)|1686 siege of Buda]]. The plot was given to the Carmelites in 1693. Laying the foundation stone in 1725, their temple was built by 1736, but only consecrated in 1763. [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] dissolved the order in 1784, and on his trip to Buda in 1786, he personally arranged to convert the temple to a theatre, to entertain government officers of Buda. The plans were made by [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]]. A part of the crypt under the sanctuary was rebuilt as a trap room, and cells functioned as changing rooms. The high altar became the stage. With a three-story auditorium, and a capacity of 1200 seats, the premiere was held on 17 October 1787, from which on the theatre was home to mainly German productions for the next few decades. The first ever play in the Hungarian language was premiered on its stage, on 25 October 1790, by the company of László Kelemen. On 7 May 1800 Beethoven gave a concert here. The building was renovated in 1815.

According to a pact with the municipality of Buda, for a symbolic lease, a company like  from Kassa played in the theatre between 1833 and 1837, including acclaimed actors of the era, like [[Déryné]], [[Márton Lendvay]] or [[Gábor Egressy (actor)|Gábor Egressy]]. They formed the foundations of the later [[National Theatre (Budapest)|National Theatre]] opening in 1837. Until 1870, German troupes were playing in the building, when German plays were banned by the municipality. From 1871, the theatre was home to the National Theater, and from 1885–86, also hosted plays of the [[Népszínház]] the [[Hungarian State Opera House|Opera House]], and the [[Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest|Academy of Drama]].

After [[World War I]], the theatre re-opened on 21 March 1918. Plans were made to make the theatre a chamber theatre of the National Theatre, but it was found unfit for the task. Smaller groups played in the building until 1924, when, after the gallery collapsed, it was closed for the next five decades. During [[World War II]], it received severe bomb hits, collapsing the balcony. Until the end of the war, the building functioned as an army storage. Renovations took place in 1947.

The Várszínház was reopened on 13 February 1978, and was the home to the Népszínház until 1982, after which it was the chamber theatre of the National Theatre until 1 December 2001. From 2001, it is the home of the National Dance Theatre, thus being a theatre only in its name.

'''Cuban Spanish'''—also referred to colloquially as simply ''cubano'', or even ''cubañol''—{{Quotation needed|date=January 2018}} is the variety of the [[Spanish language]] as it is spoken in [[Cuba]].  As a [[Caribbean Spanish|Caribbean language variety]], Cuban Spanish shares a number of features with nearby varieties, including [[Syllable#Coda|coda]] deletion, [[seseo]], and {{IPA|/s/}} [[debuccalization]] ("aspiration").

==Phonology==
Characteristic of Cuban Spanish is the weak pronunciation of consonants, especially at the end of a syllable.  Syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} weakens to {{IPA|[h]}} or disappears entirely; word-final {{IPA|/n/}} becomes {{IPA|[ŋ]}}; syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}} may become {{IPA|[l]}} or {{IPA|[j]}}, or even become entirely silent.  The [[fricative]] variants of {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} (i.e. {{IPA|[ð]}}, {{IPA|[β]}}, {{IPA|[ɣ]}}) are also significantly weakened when occurring after a vowel: {{IPA|[ð]}} tends to disappear entirely, while {{IPA|[β]}} and {{IPA|[ɣ]}} become weak [[approximant]]s, with no friction at all and often barely audible as consonants.  All of these characteristics occur to one degree or another in other Caribbean varieties, as well as in many dialects in [[Andalusia]] (in southern Spain)&amp;mdash;the place of historical origin of these characteristics.

One of the most prominent features of Cuban Spanish is the [[debuccalization]] of {{IPA|/s/}} in [[Syllable#Coda|syllable coda]]. This trait is shared with most American varieties of Spanish spoken in coastal and low areas (''Lowland Spanish''), as well as with [[Canarian Spanish]] and the Spanish spoken in the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula.

Take for example, the following sentence:

:''Esos perros no tienen dueños''
:{{IPA|[ˈesoh ˈperoh no ˈtjeneŋ ˈdweɲoh]}}
:('Those dogs do not have owners')

Also, because {{IPA|/s/}} may also be deleted in the syllable coda and because this feature has variable realizations,&lt;ref name="Guitart1997"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Guitart|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; any or all instances of {{IPA|[h]}} in the above example may be dropped, potentially rendering {{IPA|[ˈeso ˈpero no ˈtjeneŋ ˈdweɲo]}}. Other examples: ''disfrutar'' ("to enjoy") is pronounced {{IPA|[dihfruˈtar]}}, and ''fresco'' ("fresh") becomes {{IPA|[ˈfrehko]}}. In Havana, ''después'' ("after[ward]") is typically pronounced {{IPA|[dehˈpwe]}}.

Another instance of consonant weakening ("[[lenition]]") in Cuban Spanish (as in many other dialects) is the deletion of intervocalic {{IPA|/d/}} in the participle ending ''&amp;#8209;ado'', as in ''cansado'' {{IPA|[kanˈsa.o]}} "tired"). 
More typical of Cuba and the Caribbean is the [[dissimilation]] of final {{IPA|/r/}} in some verb infinitives; e.g. ''parar'', to stop, can be realized as {{IPA|[paˈral]}}.

The Spanish of the eastern provinces (the five provinces comprising what was formerly [[Oriente Province]]) is closer to [[Dominican Spanish|that of the Dominican Republic]] than to the Spanish spoken in the western part of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology and syntax==
Cuban Spanish typically uses the diminutive endings ''-ico'' and ''-ica'' (instead of the standard ''-ito'' and ''-ita'') with stems that end in {{IPA|/t/}}.  For example, ''plato'' ("plate") &gt; ''platico'' (instead of ''platito''), and ''momentico'' instead of ''momentito''; but ''cara'' ("face") becomes ''carita''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form is common to the Venezuelan, Cuban, Costa Rican, Dominican, and Colombian dialects.

The suffix ''-ero'' is often used with a place name to refer to a person from that place; thus ''habanero'', ''guantanamera'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person from [[Santiago de Cuba]] is ''santiaguero'' (compare ''santiagués'' "from [[Santiago de Compostela]] (Spain)", ''santiaguino'' "from [[Santiago de Chile]]").

[[Question#By grammatical form|''Wh''-questions]], when the subject is a pronoun, are usually not inverted. Where speakers of most other varieties of Spanish would ask "¿Qué quieres?" or "¿Qué quieres tú?", Cuban speakers would more often ask "¿Qué tú quieres?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This form is also characteristic of [[Dominican Spanish|Dominican]] and [[Puerto Rican Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In keeping with the socialist polity of the country, the term ''compañero/compañera'' ("comrade" or "friend") is often used instead of the traditional ''señor/señora''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acad.depauw.edu/~mkfinney/teaching/Com227/culturalPortfolios/CUBA/Social.html "Social Life in Cuba"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;José Sánchez-Boudy, ''Diccionario de cubanismos más usuales (Cómo habla el cubano)'', Miami: Ediciones Universal, 1978. "En Cuba, hoy en día, se llama a todo el mundo «compañero»."&lt;/ref&gt; (For a contrary view, see Corbett (2007: 137).&lt;ref&gt;Ben Corbett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cBrxuDi6YQ8C&amp;lpg=PT126&amp;dq=compa%C3%B1ero%20cuba&amp;pg=PT134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''This is Cuba: An Outlaw Culture Survives''] (Westview Press: 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;) Similarly, Cuban Spanish uses the familiar second-person pronoun ''tú'' in many contexts where other varieties of Spanish would use the formal ''usted''. [[Voseo]] is practically non-existent in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Cuban Spanish is most similar to, and originates largely from, the Spanish that is spoken in the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Andalusia]]. Cuba owes much of its speech patterns to the heavy Canarian migrations of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The accent of [[La Palma]] is the closest of the Canary Island accents to the Cuban accent. Many Cubans and returning Canarians settled in the Canary Islands after the [[Cuban Revolution|revolution of 1959]]. Migration of other Spanish settlers ([[Asturian people|Asturians]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Galician people|Galicians]] and [[Castilian people|Castilian]]s) also occurred, but left less influence on the accent.

Much of the typical Cuban replacements for standard Spanish vocabulary stems from Canarian [[lexicon]]. For example, ''guagua'' ('bus') differs from standard Spanish ''autobús''. The word ''guagua'' originated in the Canaries and is an [[onomatopoeia]] stemming from the sound of a [[Klaxon]] horn. An example of Canarian usage for a Spanish word is the verb ''fajarse'' ('to fight').&lt;ref&gt;''[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?LEMA=fajar&amp;TIPO_HTML=2&amp;FORMATO=ampliado fajar] at ''Diccionario de la [[Real Academia Española]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the verb would be ''pelearse'', and ''fajar'' exists as a non-reflexive verb related to the hemming of a [[skirt]].

Much of the vocabulary that is peculiar to Cuban Spanish comes from the different historic influences on the island. Many words come from the [[Canary Islands]], but some words are of West African, French, or indigenous [[Taíno language|Taino]] origin, as well as peninsular Spanish influence from outside the Canary Islands, such as Andalusian or Galician.  American English has lent several words, including some for clothing, such as ''pulóver'' [sic] (which is used to mean "T-shirt") and ''chor'' ("shorts", with the typical Spanish change from English ''sh'' to ''ch'').

==Manners==
To speak to the elderly or to strangers, Cubans sometimes speak more formally as a sign of respect. They shake hands both on greeting and on leaving someone. Men often exchange friendly hugs (''abrazos''), and both men and women often greet friends and family with a hug and a kiss on the cheek.

However Cubans tend to speak informally, such as by addressing a stranger with ''mi corazón'' ("my heart"), ''mi vida'' ("my life"), or ''cariño'' ("dear") are common. ''Mi amor'' ("my love") is used, even between strangers, when at least one of them is a woman (for example, in being served in a shop). Cubans are less likely to use the formal second-person singular pronoun ''usted'' to speak to a stranger, elder or superior. ''Tú'' is considered acceptable in all but very formal situations; regular use of the ''usted'' form can be seen by some Cubans as an affectation or a mark of coldness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6091">'''Dancing England''' was a series of showcase traditional dance concerts held at the Derby Assembly Rooms from 1979 to 1987. They were devised and curated by Phil Heaton and John Shaw, members of the Black Cap Sword Dancers, and two very notable characters on the Nottingham and Derby folk and dance scene of the 1970s. Dancing England was set up to showcase the best of traditional dance in the UK, along with unique and/or interesting folk customs to celebrate the UK's wide cultural heritage.

==Dancing England gone by==

In 1979 Phil and John of Black Cap decided to hold a 'Feast' and invite the best dancers from across the UK as their guests, and so the idea of Dancing England was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-nut.net/articles/phil.php] The Nut on the Web. Retrieved on 2016-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was held in the evening and consisted of a series of performances by dance teams across all the styles of UK traditional dance; [[Morris dance|Cotswold Morris]], [[Rapper sword]], [[Long Sword dance|Longsword]], North West, [[Clog dance (British)|step clog dancing]], [[Border Morris|Border]], [[Molly dance|Molly]], and much more. There were also performances by [[Mummers play|mummers]] and [[Pace Egg play|Pace Eggers]], musicians and from some of the more idiosyncratic traditional teams; notably [[Britannia Coco-nut Dancers|The Britannia Coconut Dancers]], [[Abbots Bromley Horn Dance|Abbotts Bromley Horn Dancers]] and the [[Whittlesey#Whittlesea Straw Bear|Whittlesey Straw Bear]]. There were stalls selling music, ephemera and crafts, films, workshops and talks. The event was refreshed with plenty of real ale, and finished with a ceilidh late at night.

==Daughter of Dancing England==

After Dancing England came to an end in 1987, there was a brief reprise in 1993 at the same venue for the Daughter of Dancing England event. This only ran for one year, and both Dancing England and Daughter of same were sadly missed.

==The Dancing England Rapper Tournament (DERT)==

Dancing England featured a rapper sword competition in the afternoon prior to the evening concert, in homage to the Newcastle Tournament of Music and Art which was held in the city from just after the Great War until the 1950s. Following the sad demise of Dancing England in 1987, the competition continued under the name of [[Dancing England Rapper Tournament|DERT]] and now travels around the country being hosted by a different rapper sword team every year.

==The modern Dancing England Series, 2017 onwards==

2019 - Nottingham Playhouse; Saturday 26th January 2019

[[File:Dogeza 2015-01-15.png|thumb|upright=0.5|Two positions used in dogeza]]
{{nihongo|'''''Dogeza'''''|土下座}}&lt;!--||"sitting right on the ground" --- this isn't really a literal translation, is it? }}--&gt; is an element of [[Etiquette in Japan|Japanese etiquette]] which involves kneeling directly on the ground and bowing to prostrate oneself while touching one's head to the floor.&lt;ref name="Takamura"&gt;{{cite book|author=Takamura, Kōtarō|author2=Sato, Hiroaki (translation)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88bjo4y6mLQC&amp;pg=PA253 |title=A brief history of imbecility: poetry and prose of Takamura Kōtarō |page=253 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1992|isbn=0-8248-1456-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leaman"&gt;Leaman, Oliver [https://books.google.com/books?id=4SwRoW8v15cC&amp;pg=PA74 ''Friendship East and West: philosophical perspectives''] p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Chamber of Commerce in Japan (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=e4C2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Dogeza&amp;dq=Dogeza&amp;ei=vn03S_HrIYGEyQSngom1Cw&amp;cd=41 ''The Journal of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan''] ACCJ p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to show deference to a person of higher status, as a deep apology and to express the desire for a favor from said person.

The term is used in [[Japanese politics]] such as {{nihongo|''"dogeza-gaikō"''|土下座外交}} which is translated to "kowtow diplomacy" or "kowtow foreign policy".&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, Hugo (2003) [''Japan and United Nations peacekeeping: new pressures, new responses''] Routledge, p. 20 {{ISBN|0-415-26384-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Edward A. (1985) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KG5qD75RsiUC&amp;pg=PA109 ''U.S.-Japan Strategic Reciprocity: A Neo-Internationalist View''] Hoover Press, vol. 307. p.109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drifte, Reinhard (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=jfw0VtxyTPAC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=dogeza+kowtow&amp;ei=dnw3S9nvN5j2ygS7u6TnDg&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=dogeza%20kowtow&amp;f=false ''Japan's security relations with China since 1989: from balancing to bandwagoning?''] Routledge, p.7 {{ISBN|0-415-30507-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, dogeza is translated into English as "[[prostration]]"&lt;ref name="Leaman" /&gt; or "[[kowtow]]".&lt;ref name="Takamura" /&gt;

==The meaning of performing dogeza==
In the Japanese social consciousness, the act of sitting on the ground and creating a scene (dogeza), is an uncommon deference only used when one is deviating greatly from daily behavior. It is seen as part of etiquette and filled with the feeling of being sorry about troubling the other person. By performing dogeza and apologizing to someone, usually the other person would have a tendency to forgive.

==History==
In the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms|Gishiwajinden]]'' (魏志倭人伝), the oldest Chinese record of encounters with the Japanese, it was mentioned that commoners of the ancient [[Yamataikoku]] would, upon meeting noblemen along the road, fall prostrate on the spot, clapping their hands as in prayer (柏手 read: kashiwade), and this is believed to be an old Japanese custom.

The [[haniwa]] of the [[Kofun period]] can be seen prostrating themselves in dogeza.

In the early modern period, popularly as the ''[[daimyō]]''{{'}}s procession passed by, it is believed that it was mandatory for the commoners present to perform dogeza, but that is incorrect. It was normal for common people to perform dogeza in modern times when being interviewed by higher-ups.

Even now, as a method of self-protection and apology in which damage to one's image is neglected, its idea of feeling shame remains firmly rooted.

'''[[Art museum]]s''' in the United States and the United Kingdom have been hit especially hard by the '''[[2008–2012 global recession]]'''. Dwindling [[Financial endowment|endowments]] from wealthy patrons forced some museums to make difficult and controversial decisions to [[Collection (museum)#Deaccessioning|deaccession]] artwork from their collections to gain funds, or in the case of the [[Rose Art Museum]], to close the institution and sell the entire collection.

Such actions have prompted censure from Museum organizations such as the [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] in the UK and the [[Association of Art Museum Directors]] in the US. These organizations charge that the actions of their members were in violation of not only their ethics code but also the core of their mission- to provide access to a fund of cultural heritage for future scholarship- by selling works to private buyers for purposes other than funding new acquisitions. Consideration of the dire financial state of these institutions, and the intensifying effect that any punitive action by an ethics organization will have on the finances of an individual museum, has fostered debate on the merits of deaccessioning.

==Background==
[[File:Men of the Docks by G Bellows.jpg|thumb|[[George Wesley Bellows]]' ''[[Men of the Docks]]'' (1912, oil on canvas) is one of several paintings that [[Randolph College]] intends to auction]]
Art museums have struggled to meet their operating costs for years, especially as many have "suggested donations" rather than entrance fees, or have no entrance fees whatsoever, relying on endowments and membership dues. In 2006, this began to change at many museums: on 3 June 2006, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] announced that its suggested donation of $12 would become mandatory,&lt;ref name="Smith July 06"&gt;[http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/07/22/arts/design/22admi.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FS%2FSmith%2C%20Roberta&amp;pagewanted=all ''Should Art Museums Always Be Free? There’s Room for Debate.'' Roberta Smith, for the New York Times, 22 July, 2006. Retrieved 29 January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and in July of that year the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] raised its suggested admission fee from $15 to $20.&lt;ref name="Smith July 06"/&gt;

On 1 October 2007, the board of [[Randolph College]] decided to auction four works from its collection in order to raise funds for the college: ''Peaceable Kingdom'', by [[Edward Hicks]]; ''Men of the Docks'', by [[George Bellows]]; ''Through the Arroyo'', by [[Ernest Hennings]]; and ''Troubadour'', by [[Rufino Tamayo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/arts/design/02gallery.html?ref=design ''A Southern College to Sell Prized Paintings''], by Carol Vogel for the New York Times, 2 October 2007. Retrieved 29 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was halted in November when a court [[injunction]] against it was granted to a group of alumnae and others. When this coalition raised only half of the required one million dollar bond, the court lifted the injunction and the college proceeded to sell ''Troubador'' at [[Christie's]] in April 2008. The other paintings are currently held in a Christie's warehouse, to be sold when markets rebound.&lt;ref name="Finkel"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/arts/design/28fink.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1 ''Whose Rules Are These, Anyway?''], by Jori Finkel for the New York Times, 24 December 2008. Retrieved 29 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 2008, museum directors could clearly see that the crisis would greatly affect the operation of their museums. After [[Lehman Brothers]], a major [[Sponsor (commercial)|corporate sponsor]] of the [[MOMA]], filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, MOMA director [[Glenn D. Lowry]] was quoted as saying "We know there’s a storm at sea and we know it’s going to hit land and it could get ugly".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/arts/design/20muse.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=arts ''Museums Fear Lean Days Ahead''], by Carol Vogel for the New York Times, 19 October 2008. Retrieved 29 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The National Academy of Design==
[[File:Scene on the Magdalene, by Frederic Edwin Church, 1854.jpg|thumb|''Scene on the Magdalene'' (1854), by [[Frederic Edwin Church]], oil on canvas. One of two paintings sold by the [[National Academy of Design]]]]

On 5 December 2008, the [[National Academy of Design]] announced that it had sold two canvases by [[Hudson River School]] painters for 13.5 million dollars in order to meet its operating costs: ''Mount Mansfield, Vermont'', by [[Sanford Robinson Gifford]]; and ''Scene on the Magdalene'', by [[Frederic Edwin Church]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/06/arts/design/06acad.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;ref=design&amp;adxnnlx=1233275338-t5n2w2YbIPku6P5yFX4MiQ ''National Academy Sells Two Hudson River School Paintings to Bolster Its Finances''], by Randy Kennedy for the New York Times, 5 December 2008. Retrieved 29 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The decision drew criticism from the [[Association of Art Museum Directors]], who strongly oppose [[Collection (museum)#Deaccessioning|deaccessioning]] to gain funds for any purpose other than acquiring art.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt; The director of the Academy, Carmine Branagan, argued that because the Academy does not buy artwork but acquires pieces only through donations, the guideline should not apply.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt;

The decision was made by the board of the Academy, which is composed of 16 prominent American artists such as [[Chuck Close]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Wolf Kahn]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]] as well as 5 non-artist advisory board members.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pogrebin"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/arts/design/23acad.html?ref=design ''Branded a Pariah, the National Academy Is Struggling to Survive''], by Robin Pogrebin for the New York Times, 22 December 2008. Retrieved 29 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pogrebin2"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/arts/design/14acad.html?pagewanted=1&amp;fta=y ''Censured by Museum Association, National Academy Revises its Policies''], by Robin Pogrebin for the New York Times, 13 March 2009. Retrieved 26 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some have attributed the poor financial state of the academy to its unusual leadership, as most museums are governed by professional administrators and [[curator]]s.&lt;ref name="Pogrebin" /&gt;

The AAMD struck back, issuing an e-mail to its members ordering them not to loan works to the Academy or to collaborate with it on exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Pogrebin" /&gt; The apparent harshness of this reaction drew criticism from some quarters, such as Patty Gerstenblith, a law professor at [[DePaul University]] and author of ''Art, Cultural Heritage, and the Law'': "If it’s a choice between selling a Rauschenberg and keeping the museum doors open, I think there’s some justification for selling the painting".&lt;ref name="Finkel"/&gt; Others have supported the AAMD's decision, initiating a debate on the ethics of deaccessioning. According to Dan Monroe, director of the [[Peabody Essex Museum]], "The fact is as soon as you breach this principle, everybody’s got a hardship case. It would be impossible to control the outcome."&lt;ref name="Finkel"/&gt;

[[File:Mount Mansfield Vermont Gifford.jpg|thumb|[[Sanford Robinson Gifford]]'s ''Mount Mansfield, Vermont, 1859'' (Oil on canvas) was the other painting sold by the National Academy of Design]]

On 9 March 2009, representatives from the Academy and the AAMD met to discuss the Academy's financial future. The Academy agreed not to sell any more artworks, but there was no promise to lift sanctions on the part of the AAMD.&lt;ref name="Pogrebin2" /&gt; They also agreed to change the composition of their board of directors: the new board will consist of 11 artist members and 10 non-artist members.&lt;ref name="Pogrebin2" /&gt;

===Legislation===
On 17 March 2009, a bill that would ban museums from selling artwork to meet operating costs was proposed by [[Richard Brodsky]] in the [[New York State Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, Robin. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/18/arts/design/18rege.html?scp=1&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt ''Bill Seeks to Regulate Museums’ Art Sales.''] ''[[The New York Times]]'', p. C1, NY edition, 18 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It would allow museums in [[New York State]] to use money from deaccessioned artwork only for the purposes of acquiring new art or for preserving works in the collection.

Similarly, Northampton Museum and Art Gallery made the decision to sell an Egyptian Sekhemka statue to substantial controversy. The sale raised £16 Million for the Museum but resulted in a loss of its accreditation with the [[Arts Council England]]. See [[Northampton Sekhemka statue]].

The '''flag of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]''' was white, with a horizontal blue stripe in the center, one-third of the flag's hoist, superimposed on a vertical red stripe of the same width, also centered; six white, five-pointed stars are arranged in a pentagon pattern in the center of the blue band, their points up. It was adopted on 19 November 1959.

The six stars represented the six main islands of [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Curaçao]], [[Saba]], [[Sint Eustatius]], and [[Sint Maarten]].

==1986 modification==
[[File:Flag of the Netherlands Antilles.svg|thumb|right|Flag of the Netherlands Antilles (1986–2010)]]
In 1986, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles resulting in the flag being modified to depict only five stars to represent the remaining five islands.&lt;ref&gt;http://flagspot.net/flags/an.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles==

On 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles was [[Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|dissolved]] into [[Curaçao]], [[Sint Maarten]] and the three public bodies of the [[Caribbean Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;

A '''geohazard''' is a geological state that may lead to widespread damage or risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geohazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface [[landslide]]) and affect local and regional socio-economy to a large extent (e.g., [[tsunami]]s).

==Geohazards==
{{See also|Natural hazard}}
Human activities, such as drilling through overpressured zones—could result in significant risk, and as such mitigation and prevention are paramount, through improved understanding of geohazards, their preconditions, causes and implications. In other cases, particularly in montane regions, natural processes can cause catalytic events of a complex nature, such as an [[avalanche]] hitting a lake causes a debris flow, with consequences potentially hundreds of miles away, or creating a [[lahar]] by volcanism.

The continued and multi-disciplinary investigation into the occurrence and implications of geohazards, in particular offshore geohazards in relation with the oil and gas exploration, lead to specific mitigation studies and establishing relevant prevention mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadim | year = 2006 | title = Challenges to geo-scientists in risk assessment for sub-marine slides | url = | journal = Norwegian Journal of Geology | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 351–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solheim | first1 = A.| year = | title = , 2005.

[[Image:Amine Discovered with the Goule.jpg|thumb|"Amine Discovered with the Goule", from the story of Sidi Nouman, of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''|229x229px]]

A '''ghoul''' ({{lang-ar|الغول}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-ghuûl}}''), is a [[demon]] or [[monster]] originating in [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabian religion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ghoul {{!}} Arabian mythology |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/ghoul |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with graveyards and consuming human flesh. In modern fiction, the term has often been used for a certain kind of [[undead]] monster. 

By extension, the word ''ghoul'' is also used in a derogatory sense to refer to a person who delights in the [[macabre]], or whose profession is linked directly to death, such as a [[gravedigger]] or [[Grave robbery|graverobber]].

== Early etymology ==
Ghoul is from the [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|غُول}} ''ghūl'', from {{Lang|ar|غَالَ}} ''ghāla'', "to seize".&lt;ref name="Lebling2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lebling|title=Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKL3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96|date=30 July 2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85773-063-3|pages=96–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Arabic]], the term is also sometimes used to describe a greedy or gluttonous individual.

The term was first used in English literature in 1786, in [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] novel ''[[Vathek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O27-ghoul.html|title=Ghoul Facts, information, pictures &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about Ghoul|date=|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes the ''ghūl'' of Arabic folklore. This definition of the ghoul has persisted until modern times, with ghouls appearing in [[Ghouls in popular culture|popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al-Rawi|first1=Ahmed K.|date=11 November 2009|title=The Arabic Ghoul and its Western Transformation|journal=Folklore|volume=120|issue=3|pages=291–306|doi=10.1080/00155870903219730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folklore ==
[[File:Shah Namah, the Persian Epic of the Kings Wellcome L0035191.jpg|thumb|Ghouls gathering for combat in a Persian poem|274x274px]]

In the Arabic folklore, the ''ghūl'' is said to dwell in [[cemetery|cemeteries]] and other uninhabited places. A male ghoul is referred to as ''ghūl'' while the female is called ''ghulah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Werewolf Book: The Encyclopedia of Shape-Shifting Beings|last=Steiger|first=Brad|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2011|isbn=9781578593675|location=Canton, MI|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; A source identified the Arabic ghoul as a female creature who is sometimes called Mother Ghoul (''umm'' ''ghūla)'' or a relational term such as Aunt Ghoul.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture|last=Reynolds|first=Dwight|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780521898072|location=Cambridge|pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is portrayed in many tales luring hapless characters, who are usually men, into her home where she can eat them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some state that a ghoul is a desert-dwelling, shapeshifting demon that can assume the guise of an animal, especially a [[striped hyena|hyena]]. It lures unwary people into the desert wastes or abandoned places to slay and devour them. The creature also preys on young children, drinks blood, steals coins, and eats the dead,&lt;ref name="merweb"&gt;{{cite web|title=ghoul|website=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|url=http://webster.com/dictionary/ghoul|accessdate=January 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; then taking the form of the person most recently eaten. One of the narratives identified a ghoul named Ghul-I-Beaban, a particularly monstrous character believed to be inhabiting the wilderness of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead|last=Melton|first=J Gordon|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2010|isbn=9781578592814|location=Canton, MI|pages=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until [[Antoine Galland]] translated ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' into [[French language|French]] that the western idea of ghoul was introduced into European society. Galland depicted the ghoul as a monstrous creature that dwelled in cemeteries, feasting upon corpses. 

Ghouls ({{lang-fa|غول}}) also exist in [[Iranian folklore]].

The [https://gcdn.net '''Global Cultural Districts Network''' ('''GCDN''')] is a federation of global centers of [[arts]] and [[culture]]. It's members represent cities, [[Cultural district|cultural districts]], and cultural institutions from around the world, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, China, and Singapore.&lt;sup&gt;[[AEA Consulting|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==History==
GCDN was founded in 2013 by [[Adrian Ellis]], and established by [[AEA Consulting]], the New Cities Foundation, and the [[Dallas Arts District]]. Beatrice Pembroke was appointed as Director in March 2018 and Adrian Ellis is Chair.

The network’s formation was stimulated by a series of conversations among cultural leaders, who were aware that, though forums for cultural institutions to meet and discuss common issues did exist, there were none for those responsible for cultural districts.

==Members==
GCDN’s 40 current members represent cities, cultural districts, cultural institutions, non-profits, foundations, and private initiatives from around the world, including Australia, the UK, Canada, the US, Dubai, China, and Singapore.

'''Greek lace''' is considered one of the earliest forms of all lace. Some types of Greek lace include [[reticella]], Roman lace, [[cutwork]], Venetian guipure, and Greek point lace&lt;ref name="bob"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Emily|title=A history of hand-made lace|date=1900|pages=163, 140, 194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Greek lace was first made from 1480 to 1620, the designs being always a rigid geometrical type. Greek Lace was used in large quantities for the decoration of ecclesiastical vestments and cere cloths. The earliest types of Greek lace were created by straight lines buttoned over in repetition. In the beginning, Greek lace specimens were primarily formed in the simplest type of geometrical outlines. Originally, this lace was made from a tracing on parchment and then woven on a cushion in order to create the ornate pattern. As time passed and the process developed, greater variety of geometrical designs were created and shown in the lace. Patterns became more full, and the bars more ornate. The complex designs of the Greek lace were always formal and often arranged with excellent artistic effect. Geometrical outlines such as circles and triangles were slowly added to the lace to enhance its dimensions. The [[Ionian Islands]] are recognized as being the home to the creation of the Greek lace.&lt;ref name="bob" /&gt;
Reticella was mentioned in the Sforza Inventory in 1493, which spread the idea and technique even further. Other countries like Germany, France, Spain, Flanders, and England all made only a very limited extent of the Greek Lace, but it eventually was mocked and imitated, creating more types of lace.&lt;ref name="bob" /&gt; However, Greek lace became popular outside of the main manufacturing countries.

==Etymology==
Between the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries, the term Greek lace may have originated from the time when the Ionian Islands were in the possession of the Venetian Republic. A true lace is created when a thread is looped, braided, or twisted to other threads independently from a fabric in one of 3 ways: (1) with a needle, when the work is distinctively known as “needlepoint lace” (2) with bobbins, pins on a [[lace pillow|pillow]] or cushion, when the work is known as ‘pillow lace” (3) by machinery. Originally, lace was made with linen, silk, gold, or silver threads, but now lace is often made with cotton thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herschel|first1=Julia|title=A Handbook of Greek Lace Making|date=1870|publisher=Forgotten Books|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is no evidence to prove that Greek Lace was ever produced for commercial purposes in Greece. It is speculated that the term may have originated between the 15th and 18th century, when the Ionian Islands were under the rule of the Venetian Republic.

==Modern uses==
In modern day, Greek lace, or Reticella, is generally considered a furniture lace. Greek Lace is also used as decoration rather than clothing. Authentic Greek lace is now predominantly made in Italy. Modern Greek lace is made with flax thread only, rather than the silk that was originally used.&lt;ref name="bob" /&gt;

Mass production of lace is also common. While it is not authentic, the patterns often have resemblance to the geometric structures of Greek lace. Modern popular uses for lace are primarily for decoration and wedding attire. Due to its popularity, it became very widespread around the world and was modified to create other types of lace, modernly known as imitations.&lt;ref name="bob" /&gt;

==Distinguishing Greek lace==
Since Greek lace is one of the earliest form of needle lace, there are many different variations that are difficult to distinguish. One of the biggest differentiations between different types of old Greek lace is whether it is “Italian or Flemish.” However, specimens have shown that there are no standard differences between the two.&lt;ref name="Chats On Old Lace and Needlework"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowes|first1=Emily|title=Chats On Old Lace and Needlework|date=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very early Greek lace can be identified by lace trimmings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upholsterer|edition=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Authentic Greek lace is identified by the procedure of buttoning over the thread in specific patterns and can ideally be distinguished from others.&lt;ref name="Chats On Old Lace and Needlework"/&gt; When Greek lace is made by machine, it is made entirely differently. It is either woven, where two threads are used, or embroidered, when a pattern is embroidered onto something that is later removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laces|url=https://www.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/monographs/wi_lace.pdf|website=University of Arizona|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hatam–Mansim''' is a small language family of New Guinea, consisting of two languages:
*[[Hattam language|Hatam]]
*[[Mansim language|Mansim (Borai)]]

Ross (2005) tentatively classified Hatam as a branch of the [[West Papuan languages|West Papuan]] family, based on similarities in pronouns (he did not consider Mansim), but ''Glottolog'' continues to list Hatam–Mansim as an independent family.&lt;ref name=Glottolog/&gt;  Following Reesink (2002), ''Glottolog'' lists Mansim as a language distinct from Hattam: "comparisons of old wordlists (e.g. von der Gabelentz &amp; Meyer 1882) readily confirm this difference."&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DorrHouseAug2008HatTreeFromFrontDoor.jpg|thumb|220px|Halltree at the [[Clara Barkley Dorr House]]]]
A '''hatstand''' (UK), '''hatrack''' (US) or '''coat rack''' is a device used to store [[hat]]s and often [[Coat (clothing)|coat]]s on, and [[umbrella]]s within. Some upscale catalogues in Europe market it as a [[portmanteau]] from the French words Porter (carry) and Manteau (cloak).

The front hall was the introduction to the [[house]], and as such was an important part of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] home. [[Furnishings]] were selected not only to make it a useful place to hang a hat and coat, store an umbrella and leave a [[Visiting card|calling card]], but also to show family [[wealth]], [[social position]] and [[knowledge]] of current styles. A hall stand or a hatrack was the most important piece of furniture. These were new forms that appeared about 1840, as homes became larger and social visits became more structured; see also [[Hall Tree]].

Usually made of wood and standing at least {{convert|5|ft}} tall, they have a single pole making up most of the height, with a sturdy base to prevent toppling, and an array of lengthy pegs at the top for placement of hats. Smaller houses had smaller front halls, so a hanging hatrack was the answer to the problem of storing visitors' coats and hats. The complicated shapes of the spindles and hooks of both varieties created an interesting pattern on the wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050612/news_1hs12kovels.html Collectors tip hats to Victorian hall racks | The San Diego Union-Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1920s, houses had become smaller, and hall furnishings were usually just a chair, a table and perhaps a mirror - a [[closet]] or [[cupboard]] held hats and coats. 

In [[breakdancing]], the ''hatstand'' refers to the first part of a frozen [[headspin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b-boys.com/classic/bboymoves.html B-Boy Breakin Moves Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
'''''Homo sacer''''' (Latin for "the sacred man" or "the accursed man") is a figure of [[Roman law]]: a person who is [[ban (law)|banned]] and may be killed by anybody, but may not be [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] in a religious ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Agamben, Giorgio. Heller-Roazen, trans. ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The meaning of the term ''sacer'' in [[Ancient Roman religion]] is not fully congruent with the meaning it took after Christianization, and which was adopted into English as ''sacred''. In early Roman religion ''sacer'', much like the Hebrew [[:wikt:קדש|{{Hebrew|קָדוֹש}}]] ''qadoš'', denotes anything "set apart" from common society and encompasses both the sense of "hallowed" and that of "cursed". This concept of the sacred is more in line with the Islamic notion of ''[[haram]]''. The ''homo sacer'' could thus also simply mean a person expunged from society and deprived of all [[rights]] and all functions in [[civil religion]]. ''Homo sacer'' is defined in legal terms as someone who can be killed without the killer being regarded as a murderer; and a person who cannot be sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Agamben - Homo Sacer, 1995 (Valdisholm publishing company, Norwegian translation), 2. part (Homo Sacer) 1.1.  citing [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sacred human may thus be understood as someone outside the law, or beyond it. With respect to certain monarchs, in certain western legal traditions, the concepts of the sovereign and of the Homo Sacer have been conflated.&lt;ref&gt;§ 5 Constitution of Norway -&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sacred man'' could also have been used because the condemned could only rely on protection of gods.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.pl/books?id=3tTfzsdmbl4C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=prescription+homo+sacer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3c-aTIegvb&amp;sig=v2CFrKQJ7oGUQfEZe_ysaSHyU80&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIhZiL8YTcAhUmLsAKHTvHByYQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=prescription%20homo%20sacer&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of ''homo sacer'' could fall upon one as a consequence of oath-breaking. An [[oath]] in antiquity was essentially a conditional self-cursing, i.e. invoking one or several deities and asking for their punishment in the event of breaking the oath. An oathbreaker was consequently considered the property of the gods whom he had invoked and then deceived. If the oathbreaker was killed, this was understood as the revenge of the gods into whose power he had given himself. Since the oathbreaker was already the property of the oath deity, he could no longer belong to human society, or be consecrated to another deity.

A direct reference to this status is found in the [[Twelve Tables]] (8.21), laws of the early Roman Republic written in the 5th century BC. The paragraph states that a [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]] who deceives his clients is to be regarded as ''sacer''.

The idea of the status of an [[outlaw]], a criminal who is declared as unprotected by the law and can consequently be killed by anyone with impunity, persists throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. Medieval perception condemned the entire human intrinsic moral worth of the outlaw, dehumanizing the outlaw literally as a "wolf" or "wolf's-head" (in an era where hunting of wolves existed strongly, including a commercial element)&lt;ref&gt;Mary R. Gerstein, Berkeley, Ca., 1974, "Germanic Warg: The Outlaw as Werwolf", in G.J. Larson, ed., ''Myth in Indo-European Antiquity'', p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and is first revoked only by the English ''[[Habeas Corpus]]'' act of 1679 which declares that any criminal must be judged by a tribunal before being punished.

Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] takes the concept as the starting point of his main work ''[[Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life]]'' (1998).

The 1976 book '''''I Married Wyatt Earp''''' was published as a [[memoir]] of his widow [[Josephine Earp]], but after 23 years as a best-selling non-fiction book, was described as a fraud, creative exercise, and a hoax. Originally published by the respected [[University of Arizona|University of Arizona Press]], it is the second best-selling book about [[American Old West|western]] [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy U.S. Marshal]] [[Wyatt Earp]] ever sold. It was regarded for many years as a factual account that shed considerable light on the life of Wyatt Earp and his brothers in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona Territory]]. It was cited in scholarly works, assigned as classroom work, and used as a source by filmmakers. Amateur Earp historian [[Glenn Boyer]] said that the retouched image on the cover of a scantily-clad woman was of Josephine in her 20s, and based on his statements, copies of the image were later sold at auction for up to $2,875.

Boyer had a long-term relationship with members of the Earp family. He claimed that he used two manuscripts written by Josephine Earp as the basis for the memoir. The first was an account, allegedly composed by Josephine with the help of former Tombstone Mayor and ''[[The Tombstone Epitaph]]'' publisher John Clum, known as the "Clum manuscript".  The second, supposedly written by Josephine with the assistance of two Earp cousins, was known as the "Cason manuscript". Josephine fiercely protected details of her and Wyatt's early life in Tombstone, including her own life there and the existence of Wyatt Earp's second wife, [[Mattie Blaylock]], even threatening litigation to keep some details private. Josephine was repeatedly vague about her and Wyatt's time in Arizona, so much so that the Earp cousins gave up collaborating with her and publishers refused to publish the manuscript.

In 1994, other Western researchers and rival authors of new Earp books identified alleged discrepancies in the book and began to challenge the authenticity of what they called the "Clum manuscript". They also claimed to have identified factual errors and inconsistencies in other books published by Boyer, leading to an increasing number of questions about the veracity of his work. The risque cover image was linked to a [[photogravure]] titled ''Kaloma'' that had been first published by a novelty company in 1914.  A 1998 investigative article in the ''Phoenix New Times'' revealed that Boyer could not prove the Clum manuscript existed and refused to allow the reporter access to the source documentation.  The article also disclosed that the university press' editor encouraged Boyer to embellish the account. During the interview, Boyer said that he had a responsibility to protect the reputation of the Earp brothers, and that he "had a license to say any darned thing I please...[to] lie, cheat, and steal." Boyer found another publisher and continued to publish the work, representing it as an authentic history of Wyatt Earp's life.

== Origins ==

[[File:Josephine-Sarah-Marcus-c1881.jpg|thumb| Disputed portrait of Josephine Sarah Marcus at about age 20, c. 1881, by [[C. S. Fly]].]]
After the death of  [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Josephine Earp|Josephine Marcus Earp]] tried to get her own life story published. She sought the assistance of Wyatt's cousins Mabel Earp Cason and Cason's sister Vinola Earp Ackerman. The cousins recorded events in Josephine's life and found Josephine was generous with details about her life after Tombstone, but could not remember events before and while she lived in the town. The Cason manuscript the Earp cousins produced had a serious limitation: it was missing the family's most compelling and interesting story,&lt;ref name=lingufranca/&gt; the time while Josephine and Wyatt lived in Tombstone. Cason and her sister pressured Josephine to supply as much information about her time in Tombstone as she readily recalled about the rest of her life, but Josie resisted. She was very protective of her and Wyatt's image. She finally revealed only a few details, including that she had returned to Arizona when [[Johnny Behan]] promised to marry her, but was disillusioned when he continually put off the wedding.&lt;ref name=lingufranca/&gt;

Josephine approached several publishers about the book, but backed out each time due to their insistence that she be completely open and forthcoming, rather than slanting her memories to her favor. Mable Earp Cason says she and her sister "finally abandoned work on the manuscript because she would not clear up the Tombstone sequence where it pertained to her and Wyatt."&lt;ref name=morey1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morey|first=Jeffrey J.|title=The Curious Vendetta of Glenn G.

Boyer donated the original The Cason Manuscript to the University of Arizona, which is housed in a special collection and a second copy to the Ford County Historical Society.  When Boyer presented the idea of publishing the manuscript to the University of Arizona, they insisted the book had to cover the period in Tombstone. Boyer produced a second, previously unknown and still unseen manuscript, that he said Josephine had worked on between 1929 and 1932 with the help of [[John Clum]], a former editor of ''[[The Tombstone Epitaph]]'' newspaper. This became known as the "Clum manuscript."{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Notability ===

The [[University of Arizona|University of Arizona Press]] published the book in 1976 under the title ''I Married Wyatt Earp: The Recollections of Josephine Sarah Marcus''. The copyright was issued in her name and her name was given as the author.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;&lt;ref name=azmarried1994&gt;{{cite book |title=I Married Wyatt Earp: The Recollections of Josephine Sarah Marcus Earp |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Phoenix, Arizona|year=1994 |pages=277|asin=B000WWBJQ0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book published by a university press usually must meet a high standard. When it is sold as non-fiction, academics consider the university's approval sacrosanct.&lt;ref name=tumbleweed/&gt;

Boyer's book gained wide acceptance as a memoir written by Josephine and an accurate portrayal of her life with Wyatt Earp.  The book was immensely popular for many years, capturing the imagination of people with an interest in western history, studied in classrooms, cited by scholars, and relied upon as factual by filmmakers.&lt;ref name=ortega29may&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Tony|title=I Varied Wyatt Earp|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-03-04/news/i-varied-wyatt-earp/|publisher=Phoenix New Times|accessdate=29 May 2011|date=March 4, 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020095737/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-03-04/news/i-varied-wyatt-earp/|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the university's fourth all-time best-selling book with 12 printings totaling more than 35,000 copies.&lt;ref name=lingufranca&gt;{{cite web|last=Decker|first=Jefferson|title=Tombstone Blues|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9907/blues.html|work=Inside Publishing|year=1999|publisher=LingaFranca.com|accessdate=1 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515015042/http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9907/blues.html|archivedate=15 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second-largest selling book about Wyatt Earp.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|title=Bunfight at the OK Corral|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jul/10/books.guardianreview1|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=9 July 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507181349/http://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jul/10/books.guardianreview1|archivedate=7 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyer in turn received wide recognition as the foremost authority on Wyatt Earp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Gary|title=Trailing an American Mythmaker: History and Glenn G.

He is responsible for the publication of [[Big Nose Kate]]'s memoirs as well as the long-sought ''Flood Manuscript'' written with Wyatt Earp's direct input.&lt;ref name=morey1994/&gt;

For many years, the book was accepted as a legitimate historical document&lt;ref name=tumbleweed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~knuthco1/IMWEfiles2/articles-IMWEsource.htm |title=History Expose the Facade Behind the Front |publisher=Tombstone Tumbleweed |date=March 16, 2000 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418050521/http://home.earthlink.net/~knuthco1/IMWEfiles2/articles-IMWEsource.htm |archivedate=April 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was cited by important works on Tombstone like ''And Die in the West'' by Paula Mitchell Marks, ''Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait'' by Karen Holliday Tanner,&lt;ref name=sharlet/&gt; and Richard Maxwell Brown's social history of frontier law, ''No Duty to Retreat'' (Oxford, 1991).&lt;ref name=lingufranca/&gt; The book was even adopted as required reading in history classes.&lt;ref name=hayesbohanan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://celebratethestates.blogspot.com/2010_02_01_archive.html |title=Controversy Over I Married Wyatt Earp |first=Pamela |last=Hayes-Bohanan |date=February 14, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091206/http://celebratethestates.blogspot.com/2010_02_01_archive.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  University of New Mexico history professor Paul Hutton, who has served as executive director of the Western History Association, noted in 1998 that the University of Arizona had been selling the book for 23 years as an individual's memoir and an important historical document.&lt;ref name=ortega2/&gt;

However, critics began to question Boyer's sources for the book in the 1990s.

== Book sources ==
{{details|Glenn Boyer}}

According to an interview with Boyer in 2009, when he turned 85, his family had a long-standing relationship with the Earps. According to Boyer, his father was a janitor in a saloon owned by Josie and Wyatt in Nome, Alaska. The son of Wyatt's good friend George Miller, Bill Miller, married Estelle Edwards, the daughter of Wyatt's sister Adelia Earp Edwards. Boyer said Bill and Estelle became a second set of parents to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not Married to Wyatt Earp - Glenn Boyer Interview|url=http://www.historynet.com/not-married-to-wyatt-earp-glenn-boyer-interview.htm/1|publisher=Wild West Magazine|accessdate=7 June 2011|date=September 21, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218080057/http://www.historynet.com/not-married-to-wyatt-earp-glenn-boyer-interview.htm/1|archivedate=18 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Earp cousins attempted to write about Josephine's life in Tombstone, she was very evasive. Even when Wyatt was alive, she and her husband were very protective of their "past". Author [[Stuart N. Lake]] interviewed Earp eight times before his death and began writing his biography. Josie corresponded with Lake, and he insisted she attempted to influence what he wrote and hamper him in every way possible, including consulting lawyers. Josie claimed she was striving to protect Wyatt Earp's legacy.&lt;ref name=shapell&gt;{{cite web|title=Josephine Earp, Wyatt Earp's Jewish Widow, Admits Her Destitution to Earp's Biographer|url=http://www.shapell.org/manuscript.aspx?170348|publisher=Shapell Manuscript Collection|accessdate=10 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509065436/http://www.shapell.org/manuscript.aspx?170348|archivedate=9 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She successfully prevented her name from being mentioned in Lake's book ''Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal'', and there is reason to believe that Lake avoided including her because she threatened legal action. As an unmarried woman in frontier Tombstone without visible means of support, perhaps an actress and a dancer, vastly outnumbered by men, if she had not been a prostitute, she undoubtedly was regarded by some as one.&lt;ref name=lubet/&gt;{{rp|101}}

Kit Scheifele, who was the original editor of Boyer's book for the University of Arizona Press, noticed that Boyer had removed wording from his original introduction to the book that made it clear "that the manuscript you have presented is not solely the first-person writing of Mrs. Earp, and that you have written a first-person account based on her memoirs and other material as well." She asked him to restore the content, but Boyer ignored her request.&lt;ref name=ortega2/&gt;  Karen Thure, who prepared the book for publication, questioned Boyer's sources from the beginning. She asked to see copies of the Clum manuscript more than once, and Boyer refused each time. "Glenn put a lot of Glenn in there. Glenn's theories appeared as Josie's," she said. "I think it's a shame that anyone took ''I Married Wyatt Earp'' literally," she says. "It's somewhere between history and historical fiction."&lt;ref name=ortega2/&gt;

=== Clum manuscript sources ===

Boyer claimed to possess the so-called Clum manuscript.&lt;ref name=ortega4/&gt; He said it contained details of Wyatt and Josie's life in Tombstone that was missing from the story she wrote with the Earp cousins. Boyer said that the Clum manuscript had been written by ''[[The Tombstone Epitaph]]'' publisher [[John Clum]] based on conversations with Josephine.&lt;ref name=ortega4&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Tony|title=How the West Was Spun|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-12-24/news/how-the-west-was-spun/4/|accessdate=29 May 2011|date=December 24, 1998|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020095648/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-12-24/news/how-the-west-was-spun/4/|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Boyer confused readers and critics when he changed the story behind the origins of the manusccript.

In 1977, Boyer published a pamphlet, ''Trailing an American Myth,'' in which he stated that the Clum manuscript was actually written by several authors. He wrote that their work formed "the basis of the Tombstone years in ''I Married Wyatt Earp'' and "the Ten Eyck Papers in ''Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta.''" In the same year, Boyer wrote and published another pamphlet, "Who Killed John Ringo?" It stated that fiction writers [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[Wilson Mizner]], [[Rex Beach]] and [[Walt Coburn]] had written a portion of the  manuscript documenting Josephine' Tombstone years.&lt;ref name=adare/&gt;  When questioned about the origins of the Clum manuscript during the early 1980s, Boyer changed his story to say that he did not receive the Clum manuscript from Colyn after all, instead it was given to him by one of Earp's nieces, Jeanne Cason Laing in 1967.&lt;ref name=lingufranca/&gt;&lt;ref name=kirschner/&gt; 

When asked if these were all the same manuscript, Boyer replied, "Some of them are a manuscript. Some are only a mishmash, as a matter of fact... The earlier ones of those guys all lean heavily on Clum and Parsons for insights, which is one of the reasons they got in trouble with Josephine Earp... This is a broad way when I say I refer to a Clum manuscript, for example. It is a broad way of referring to something when really this is nobody's business in a way."&lt;ref name=adare/&gt;

=== Cason manuscript origins ===

In addition to the manuscript written by Clum, Boyer said he had a copy of a manuscript that Josephine prepared with the help of two of her husband's cousins, Mabel Earp Cason and her sister Vinolia Earp Ackerman. Wyatts' cousins pressed her for details about her personal life before and while living in Tombstone, but she was evasive. Josephine wanted to keep her and Wyatt Earp's tarnished history associated with Tombstone private and sanitize anything that could be seen negatively. Josephine finally consented to tell them that upon returning to Arizona, she believed Johnny Behan was going to marry her, and was disappointed and disillusioned when he repeatedly delayed the wedding. In her version of events, she said years later that she lived with a lawyer while working as a housekeeper for Behan and his ten-year-old son, Albert.&lt;ref name=kirschner&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirschner|first=Ann|title=Lady at the O.K. Corral: The True Story of Josephine Marcus Earp|year=2013|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780062199003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seeking more information, Boyer contacted Virgil Earp's granddaughter Mable Earp Cason only to learn she had died.  Based on his reputation and success with his prior book on Earp, her daughter Jeanne Cason Laing cooperated with Boyer. She sifted through years of material her mother had collected during resulting from three attempts by her mother Mabel's and aunt Vinnolia's attempt to write a biography of Josephine Earp. This included drafts and notes from their first attempt at collaborating with Josephine during the 1930s, which was part of something that Jeanne called "the Clum manuscript". Mabel also had collected materials and letters during 1955, when she made another attempt to get the work published, and corresponded with Earp historian John Gilchriese and the publishing house [[Houghton Mifflin]]. She has also collected clippings and correspondence with researchers during the mid-1960s. They loaned him "a stack of material almost a foot high."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Just what is Virgil Earp’s connection to Prescott ? {{!}} Prescott Reenactors |url=http://www.prescottreenactors.com/just-what-is-virgil-earps.html |website=www.prescottreenactors.com |accessdate=7 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyer argues that she actually lived with Behan. Boyer warns readers of  "her 'little-old-lady' attempts to tell only the decorous and proper." Interviewers said she was often "difficult" to interview.&lt;ref name=bart&gt;{{cite web|last=Bart|first=Black|title=I Married Wyatt Earp – The Recollections of Josephine Sarah Marcus Earp|url=http://www.fiveshot.org/guests/earp.htm|work=Book Review|accessdate=14 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202093127/http://fiveshot.org/guests/earp.htm|archivedate=2 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyer interviewed her and other family members, gleaning details of Josephine's life, and received additional documents and photographs.&lt;ref name=kirschner/&gt; He said the documents contributed "to the overall fabric of Josie's story were undoubtedly made by former Tombstone mayor and Earp friend John Clum," but that "some Earp researchers got hung up on this 'manuscript' business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not Married to Wyatt Earp - Glenn Boyer Interview|url=http://www.historynet.com/not-married-to-wyatt-earp-glenn-boyer-interview.htm|publisher=Wild West Magazine|accessdate=16 September 2014|date=September 21, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006065421/http://www.historynet.com/not-married-to-wyatt-earp-glenn-boyer-interview.htm|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authenticity of the manuscripts ===

Boyer said he merged the Clum and Cason manuscripts, "which contained vastly different materials presented in widely different styles."&lt;ref name=lingufranca/&gt; To bolster the authenticity of the book, Boyer pointed to affidavits and letters from the Cason family. Virgil Earp's great-granddaughter Jeanne Cason Laing had provided Boyer with the collection of papers that included the source materials for the Clum manuscript in 1967. In a September 21, 1983 statement, Laing wrote, "I believe the book edited by Mr. Boyer is ''[[good faith|bona fide]]'' in its entirety and is remarkably accurate in its portrayal of Mrs. Earp's character and personality."&lt;ref name=expose/&gt;

"My mother and Aunt were aware of the earlier 'Clum' manuscript covering the Tombstone years, and for that reason were willing to burn that portion of their manuscript at Mrs. [Josephine] Earp's request. My aunt had written that portion."&lt;ref name=kirschner/&gt; Laing was not a historian or writer and had not cataloged the material.&lt;ref name=kirschner/&gt; She had not seen the so-called Clum manuscript and relied on Boyer's word as to its authenticity.&lt;ref name=expose/&gt;  Although the exact contents of stack of materials Laing gave Boyer are unknown, Jeanne Cason Laing and other members of her family insisted that Josephine had started a manuscript with John Clum.&lt;ref name=kirschner/&gt;

Jack Burrows, who wrote '' John Ringo, The Gunfighter Who Never Was'', said, "How can he just take a stack of material and give it a name that has nothing to do with what's included? You can take a cowpie and call it filet mignon, but somebody's going to catch on during dinner. This is just gobbledygook."&lt;ref name=expose&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Gary|title=History Expose - The Facade Behind the Front|publisher=Tombstone Tumbleweed|date=March 16, 2000|url=http://www.tombstonehistoryarchives.com/?page_id=98|accessdate=3 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004011532/http://www.tombstonehistoryarchives.com/?page_id=98|archivedate=4 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virgil's great-grand-niece Alice Greenberg found a collection of type-written pages along with a sketch of the gunfight of the O.K. corral. The manuscript turned out to be the long-missing Flood manuscript and the sketch had been drawn by Wyatt Earp from memory.&lt;ref name=kirschner/&gt;

=== Errors noted ===

The Clum manuscript was apparently Boyer's name for the materials given him by Laing, which include a collection of notes, newspaper accounts, memorabilia, and the written recollections of relatives, plus other materials he had acquired over many years.&lt;ref name=lingufranca/&gt; Boyer said that he "often used my knowledge of Josie when using dialogue so she could tell her tale, the way she wanted." He insisted that his knowledge of her life was "fortified by my written, taped and oral research," and that it didn't matter if "the details Josie gave in her memoirs are correct."&lt;ref name=historynet&gt;{{cite web |title=Not Married to Wyatt Earp - Glenn Boyer Interview |url=http://www.historynet.com/not-married-to-wyatt-earp-glenn-boyer-interview.htm |publisher=Historynet.com |date=September 21, 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515044202/http://www.historynet.com/not-married-to-wyatt-earp-glenn-boyer-interview.htm |archivedate=15 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the collection and his personal knowledge, he wrote his synthesized version of Marcus' life in Tombstone as if the words were Josephine's. Boyer also made several errors in the process.&lt;ref name=lingufranca/&gt;

One inconsistency noted by other researchers is the account of [[Warren Earp]]'s death. Josephine allegedly wrote in ''I Married Wyatt Earp'' how Wyatt returned to Arizona to avenge [[Warren Earp]]'s July 6, 1900 killing. However, on June 29, 1900, the ''Nome Daily News'' reported that Wyatt had been arrested for "interfering with an officer while in the discharge of his duty ... Earp, upon reaching the barracks, asserted that his action had been misconstrued, and that he had intended to assist the deputy marshal." Other references to him in the newspaper placed him in Alaska for the next several weeks. There was no way for Wyatt to get to Arizona in the time available.&lt;ref name=morey1994/&gt;

Boyer's Josephine cites an article from the Tombstone ''Weekly Nugget'' of March 19, 1881—an article that smeared Earp's friend [[Doc Holliday]] by implicating him in a botched stagecoach robbery. "Doc's implication in this robbery through the propaganda of...the Nugget," she writes, "led straight to the Earps' shootout with the rustlers some six months later." But author Casey Tefertiller studied the ''Nugget'' microfiche and could not find a reference to Holliday. After further research, he suggested that Boyer had made a gaffe common to Earp researchers—he had lifted a confabulated version of the Nugget article from Billy Breakenridge's 1928 book, ''Helldorado: Bringing the Law to the Mesquite''.&lt;ref name=lingufranca/&gt;

=== Earp family seek manuscript return ===

As the severity of Boyer's inventions became more widely known, Laura Cason, the granddaughter of Mable Earp Cason who helped author the Cason Manuscript, issued a statement that said, "Mr. Boyer now claims that ''I Married Wyatt Earp'' is creative non-fiction when he has always led our family to believe it as a true account and memoir of Josephine Earp."&lt;ref name=tumbleweed/&gt; In February 2000, when the controversy over the book became widely known, she formally asked Boyer to return the Cason manuscript, stating that they had always intended to only loan the material to him. "We are saddened to learn that Mr. Boyer has seemingly manipulated Cason family members over the years in an apparent effort to provide authentication when questions arose."&lt;ref name=gabrielson&gt;{{cite web |title=Family Wants Manuscript Back From Boyer |first=Ryan |last=Gabrielson |publisher=Arizona Daily Wildcat |date=February 11, 2000 |url=http://www.tombstonehistoryarchives.com/?page_id=100 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004011537/http://www.tombstonehistoryarchives.com/?page_id=100 |archivedate=October 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer reacted by threatening a lawsuit and said that younger members of the Earp descendants were motivated by greed. The younger Cason family members were never successful in any of their efforts to gain ownership of the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Laura D.Cason&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyer donated a copy of the manuscript, along with other materials, to the Dodge City Historical Society, but retained the right to only allow individuals he authorized to see the documents.&lt;ref name=kirschner/&gt;

=== Value at auction ===

Once the image appeared on the cover of the book, and due to the book cover attribution, copies of the portrait of "Josephine Earp" began to sell for hundreds and later thousands of dollars. Citations in auction catalogs and from dealer sales, all after the 1976 publication of ''I Married Wyatt Earp'', were regularly used for a number of years to "verify" that the image was Josie Earp. On December 6, 1996 the image, represented as a picture of Josephine Earp, was offered by H. C. A. Auctions in Burlington, North Carolina and sold for USD $2,750.&lt;ref name=rowe/&gt;

Don Ackerman wrote ''Maine Antique Digest'' in April 1997 questioning the authenticity of the image sold at auction. Bob Raynor of the magazine acknowledged that H. C. A., after researching the image, had represented it as being Josie Earp.&lt;ref name=rowe/&gt; He noted that "Both [[Sotheby's]] and Swann Galleries identified and sold the photo image in 1996, both auctions prior to the December HCA auction." Raynor stated, "Please note that the image was used as a dust cover of the book ''I Married Wyatt Earp'', published by University of Arizona Press, 1976. Additionally, the image was used in another book, ''Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta'', published by Talei, and also in ''Pioneer Jews'', Houghton Mifflin, 1984. In all instances the image was identified as Josephine Earp." However, all these sources postdate and rely on Boyer's use of the image on the cover of the book.&lt;ref name=rowe/&gt; On April 8, 1998, Sotheby's  sold another copy of the image for $2,875.&lt;ref name=rowe/&gt;

=== Known origin ===

However, the first known published image of the photograph of the beautiful young woman boldly posing for the camera wearing a sheer gauze [[peignoir]] was circulated in 1914. Labeled "Kaloma," it was originally produced as an art print. The risqué image was popular and sold well.&lt;ref name=rowe/&gt; At the bottom right of the uncropped, original image is printed, "COPYRIGHT 1914-P N CO." The image was copyrighted and circulated by the Pastime Novelty Company of 1313 Broadway, New York, New York.&lt;ref name=logcabin&gt;{{cite web|title=Wyatt Earp's Wife Jose 1914 Photo As Kaloma|url=http://logcabin-antiques.com/dynapage/IP47.htm|date=December 13, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325015623/http://logcabin-antiques.com/dynapage/IP47.htm |archivedate=March 25, 2012|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hyman&gt;{{cite book|editor=Paula E.

It was used as a pin-up image during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=rowe/&gt;

Most of the early Kaloma images seen to date are [[photogravures]], a type of high-quality reproduction that has been produced since the 1850s, with a surge in popularity between 1890 and 1920. A photogravure is made from an engraving plate on a printing press, making them much less costly than actual photographs. Photogravures were often printed with title and publication data below the image and were commonly used to create many copies of high quality illustrations for books, postcards and art magazines.&lt;ref name=rowe/&gt;

The image regained popularity in the 1960s. One of the great rock poster designers of the time, [[Alton Kelley]] with Family Dog Productions in Haight Ashbury, made the image of the semi-nude woman as the centerpiece of his classic concert poster for [[Vanilla Fudge]] and The Charles Lloyd Quartet when they appeared at the [[Avalon Ballroom]] in San Francisco September 29-October 1, 1967.&lt;ref name=rowe/&gt;

=== Links to Josephine Earp ===

No evidence has been found that links the picture to Josephine before Boyer's book was published in 1976, and no primary sources have been found that link the photo to Josephine's time in Tombstone.&lt;ref name=rowe/&gt; Many individuals share similar facial features and faces on people who look radically different can look similar when viewed from certain angles. Because of this, most museum staff, knowledgeable researchers and collectors require [[provenance]] or a documented history for an image to support physical similarities that might exist. Experts will rarely offer even a tentative identification of new or unique images of famous people based solely on similarities shared with other known images.&lt;ref name=rowe&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maineantiquedigest.com/articles_archive/articles/oct02/josi1002.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320071207/http://maineantiquedigest.com/articles_archive/articles/oct02/josi1002.htm|first=Jeremy |last=Rowe |year=2002|archivedate=20 March 2012|title=Thoughts on Kaloma, the Purported Photograph of Josie Earp |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the photograph shows that the fashion and hair style of the young woman are not from the 1880s time frame, but from the early 20th Century.&lt;ref name=facts/&gt; If the 1914 copyright date is the year the picture was taken, Josephine Earp would have been 53 in 1914. Casey Terfertiller's book ''Wyatt Earp The Life Behind the Legend'' contains a picture of an elderly Josephine Marcus Earp on page 225. The photo is from the Robert G. McCubbin Collection and has been verified as authentic. The date of the photograph is estimated at about 1921. Josephine is elderly and very plump. This contrasts sharply with the alleged 1914 photo of a very young, thin and buxom "Josie".&lt;ref name=facts/&gt;

On November 26, 1997, Dave McKenna of ABC Novelty Company, the successor to the original company that produced the image, wrote "I will confirm that this photo was copyrighted under the ABC name in 1914. In our warehouse we have a thousand similar photos of nude woman that we used and still use. My understanding is that the photographs were taken in New York or Boston."&lt;ref name=facts/&gt;

Boyer responded to criticism of the validity of the image by offering to sell proof in a booklet available from his company, "Historical Research Associates" operated out of his home in Rodeo, New Mexico.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clantongang.com/oldwest/facts.htm |title=Tombstone Facts, Finds &amp; Fakes |accessdate=6 June 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003231247/http://www.clantongang.com/oldwest/facts.htm |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histres.com/Other/ContactUs.asp |title=Contact Us Historical Research Associates |accessdate=6 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990427044442/http://www.histres.com/Other/ContactUs.asp |archivedate=April 27, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked directly about the authenticity of the image in 2009, he replied, "Actually the publisher made the decision for the cover.

== Other invented sources ==

Several Western researchers have uncovered a pattern in Boyer's publications of inventing not only sources but fictional individuals who supply insight and perspective into real events and people. Jack Burrows wrote that Boyer "has published three different memoirs telling how Wyatt Earp killed Ringo, all giving different stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letters to the Editor of True West|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~knuthco1/IMWEfiles/lttrstoeditorsource.htm|publisher=True West Magazine|accessdate=3 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910094425/http://home.earthlink.net/~knuthco1/IMWEfiles/lttrstoeditorsource.htm|archivedate=10 September 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyers justified the three different stories as representing three different person's perspectives. The ''Phoenix New Times'' reported in a lengthy investigative article that "Fiction appears to infuse much of his historical writings."&lt;ref name=ortega1&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Tony|title=How the West Was Spun|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-12-24/news/how-the-west-was-spun/|accessdate=29 May 2011|date=December 24, 1998|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020095900/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-12-24/news/how-the-west-was-spun/|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyer's first book, ''An Illustrated History of Doc Holliday'', was published in 1966. Boyer wrote ten years later that he purposefully attempted to mislead others. Bogus photos of 'Perry Mallon,' 'Johnny Tyler,' and Doc's cousin 'Mattie Holliday' were inserted into a fabricated story about Doc and Wyatt killing Mallon and Tyler in Colorado.  The picture of Mattie Holliday was a photograph of Boyer's father's cousin.&lt;ref name=morey1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=robertsmytymaker&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Gary L.|title=Trailing an American Mythmaker: History and Glenn G.

Bob Palmquist, an attorney and avid Earp researcher, worked with Boyer for several years. He said that Boyer intended to write ''Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta'' as "...a novel in the style of a memoir as if somebody was actually telling the story, in this case Ted Ten Eyck."&lt;ref name=ortega6&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Tony|title=How the West Was Spun|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-12-24/news/how-the-west-was-spun/6/|accessdate=29 May 2011|date=December 24, 1998|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020100019/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-12-24/news/how-the-west-was-spun/6/|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer told other versions about the origins of Ted Ten Eyck, saying he had received a new manuscript from Earp family members, that the story was based on the unpublished memoir of a newspaper journalist who was present in Tombstone while the Earps were lawmen,&lt;ref name=ortega6/&gt; and that he had used Ten Eyck as a literary device and the book was in the form of a "[[non-fiction novel]]." In a 1977 interview he altered his description of the newspaperman once again. He said, "I am Ten Eyck. I'm the literary artist that created the composite figure that I chose to call Ten Eyck."&lt;ref name=adare&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adare|first1=Sierra|title=Boyer vs. Tefertiller: Penslingers Face off over Wyatt Earp|url=http://www.historynet.com/boyer-vs-tefertiller-penslingers-face-off-over-wyatt-earp.htm|accessdate=16 September 2014|publisher=Wild West Magazine|date=August 10, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007154711/http://www.historynet.com/boyer-vs-tefertiller-penslingers-face-off-over-wyatt-earp.htm|archivedate=7 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on publication ==

Boyer responded to criticism saying he had an artistic license. His credibility was questioned, while his unwillingness or inability to provide researchers with evidence led the University to re-assess the book.

=== University withdraws book ===

In an interview in 1999, the university's current president Peter Likins described the book as having a "fictional format." Although Likens admitted he had not read the book, he said the book states that it isn't a first-person account but a blend of secondary sources. The epilogue says that it is a memoir based on Josephine Earp's own writing.&lt;ref name=ortega2/&gt; Likins characterized the disagreements about the book's authenticity as a squabble between non-academic authors hoping to promote different interpretations of Western history. It might take years, Likins said, for scholars to decide which version of Earp events was correct.&lt;ref name=ortega2/&gt; During his investigation of Boyer's work, reporter Tony Ortega found that "the University of Arizona Press not only knew his sources were suspect, but they encouraged him to embellish."&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; Marshall Townsend, Director of the University of Arizona Press when Boyer's book was published, actively discouraged two editors from questioning Boyer, and repeatedly encouraged him to put "more of yourself" into the book.&lt;ref name="lingufranca"/&gt;

Author Andrew Albanese wrote that "historians agree that the press has put its integrity on the line by allowing Boyer's bogus Tombstone account to enter the mainstream of Western history under the imprimatur of a scholarly press."&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; In 1999, the University of Arizona Press director said they would reissue the book with a redesigned cover and alter the cover copy to make it clearer that the author was Glenn Boyer and not Josephine Earp.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; Hutton said that the university's decision to claim that the book is partly fiction after 23 years "is essentially foisting a fraud upon the public."&lt;ref name=ortega2/&gt;

When confronted with allegations that his book was a hoax, Boyer said he had been misunderstood. "My work is beginning to be recognized by all but a few fanatics and their puppets as a classic example of the newly recognized genre '[[Non-fiction novel|creative non-fiction]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Decker|first=Jefferson|title=Tombstone Blues|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9907/blues.html|work=Inside Publishing|publisher=Lingua Franca|accessdate=7 June 2011|date=July–August 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515015042/http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9907/blues.html|archivedate=15 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer compared his work to [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning author [[Edmund Morris (writer)|Edmund Morris]], who wrote ''Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan''. Professor Donna Lee Brien wrote that in his "confused defence" Boyer failed to differentiate between his actions, collecting and blending primary source documents with his own fictionalized accounts, and Morris's very "experimental biography which transparently acknowledged his inclusion of clearly recognisably fictional passages into traditionally sourced and referenced text."&lt;ref name=brien/&gt; She noted that "...as soon as Boyer invented source manuscripts, fabricated elements of the story and presented his own speculations as historical fact, he was not writing creative nonfiction but historical fiction—that is, fiction based on historical events."&lt;ref name=brien/&gt;

In early 2000 the University refused to comment about the book and referred all questions to university lawyers.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;  On January 29, 2000, Boyer posted a note on Amazon.com that he intended to take back the rights to the book.&lt;ref name=expose/&gt; In March the University of Arizona Press announced they had released all rights to the book,&lt;ref name=kirschner/&gt; removed the book from their catalog,&lt;ref name=brien&gt;{{cite book |last=Brien |first=Donna Lee |title=The Power of Truth: Literary Scandals and Creative Nonfiction |url=http://www.writingnetwork.edu.au/files/Brien%20The%20Power%20of%20Truth.pdf |work=Creative Writing: Theory Beyond Practice |editor=Tess Brady and Nigel Krauth |publisher=Post-Pressed |location=Brisbane |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408002742/http://www.writingnetwork.edu.au/files/Brien%20The%20Power%20of%20Truth.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned unsold copies to Boyer.&lt;ref name=brien/&gt; Boyer claimed he decided to drop publication because he was disappointed with the university's handling of movie rights.&lt;ref name=robertstravesty/&gt; Boyer found a small non-academic publisher, shortened the title to ''I Married Wyatt Earp'', and shifted authorship to his own name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Glen|title=I Married Wyatt Earp|year=1999|publisher=Sinclair-Stevenson Ltd|location=|isbn=978-0-18-650583-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boyer response ===

Boyer has admitted that the book is "100 percent Boyer."&lt;ref name=ortega29may/&gt; He said that he is uninterested in what others think of the accuracy of what he has written. "This is an artistic effort. I don't have to adhere to the kind of jacket that these people are putting on me. I am not a historian. I'm a storyteller."&lt;ref name=ortega2&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Tony|title=How the West Was Spun|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-12-24/news/how-the-west-was-spun/2/|accessdate=29 May 2011|date=December 24, 1998|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020095834/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-12-24/news/how-the-west-was-spun/2/|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer said the book was not really a first-person account, that he had interpreted Wyatt Earp in Josephine's voice, and admitted that he couldn't produce any documents to vindicate his methods.&lt;ref name=ortega29may/&gt;

Boyer admitted that two other books he had written, ''An Illustrated Life of Doc Holliday'' (Reminder Press, 1966), and ''Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta'', (Talie, 1993) were not based on the documents he claimed to have used. He followed the last book with a fourteen-part series in ''True West'' magazine titled ''Wyatt Earp, Legendary American''. Boyer responded to continuing questions about his sources and allegations of fraud, claiming that because of his close connection to the  Earp family, he "had a license to say any darned thing I please for the purpose  of protecting the reputation of the Earp Boys, which I committed myself to do.  I can lie, cheat, and steal, and figuratively ambush, antagonize, poison wells,  and all of the others [sic] things that go with a first class Vendetta, even a  figurative one."&lt;ref name=robertstravesty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Gary L.|title=The Real Tombstone Travesty:  The Earp Controversy from Bechdolt to Boyer|url=http://www.tombstonehistoryarchives.com/?page_id=115|journal=WOLA Journal|volume=VIII|issue=3|date=Fall 1999|accessdate=1 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004011433/http://www.tombstonehistoryarchives.com/?page_id=115|archivedate=4 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on Old West research ==

Professor of Western history Gary Roberts wrote that Earp researchers are burdened with discriminating between Boyer fact and Boyer fiction. "By passing off his opinions and interpretations as primary sources, he has poisoned the record in a way that may take decades to clear."&lt;ref name=ortega3&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Tony|title=How the West Was Spun|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-12-24/news/how-the-west-was-spun/3/|accessdate=29 May 2011|date=December 24, 1998|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020095913/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-12-24/news/how-the-west-was-spun/3/|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Boyer's work is so enmeshed into the literature that if it is discredited virtually everything written since ''I Married Wyatt Earp'' was published is suspect to the extent that its conclusions are based on material drawn from Boyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Gary|title=Trailing an American Mythmaker: History and Glenn G.

The book has become an example of how supposedly factual works can trip up the public, researchers, and librarians. It was described by the ''Annual Review of Information Science and Technology'' in 2006 as a "creative exercise" and hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Blaise Cronin|title=Annual Review of Information Science and Technology|year=2006|publisher=Information Today|location=Medford, N.J.|isbn=978-1-57387-242-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|489}} Other authors agreed that the book cannot be relied on.&lt;ref name=lubet&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubet|first=Steven|title=Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=978-0-300-11527-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|154}}

Glenn Boyer's contributions to Wyatt Earp studies were widely regarded, but doubts raised by ''Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta'' seriously damaged his credibility.&lt;ref name=morey1994/&gt; Author Gary Roberts, a Western historian, noted, "History is what's suffered the most. It's all kind of tragic really."&lt;ref name=gabrielson/&gt; Allen Barra, author of ''Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends'', believes that ''I Married Wyatt Earp'' is now recognized by Earp researchers as a hoax.&lt;ref name=ortega2/&gt;  Casey Tefertiller, a long-time critic of Boyer and the author of ''Wyatt Earp: The Life Behind the Legend'', agreed. "This may be the most remarkable literary hoax in American history. It has been believed and accepted as the words of Josephine Earp for twenty-three years now."&lt;ref name=lingufranca/&gt; Tefertiller's book was one of the very few that didn't use any of Boyer's work as a source. Boyer commented, "Writing about Earp and failing to mention me and my work is something like writing about Catholicism and neglecting to mention the Pope."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adare|first1=Sierra|title=Boyer vs. Tefertiller: Penslingers Face off over Wyatt Earp|url=http://www.historynet.com/boyer-vs-tefertiller-penslingers-face-off-over-wyatt-earp.htm|publisher=Wild West Magazine|accessdate=16 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007154711/http://www.historynet.com/boyer-vs-tefertiller-penslingers-face-off-over-wyatt-earp.htm|archivedate=7 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Inside Deep Throat''''' is a 2005 American [[documentary film]] about the 1972 [[pornographic film]] ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', at the forefront of the [[Golden Age of Porn]], and its effects on American society. 

== Content ==
{{More plot|date=January 2015}}
The film discusses how ''Deep Throat'' was distributed to theaters. Prints would be hand-delivered and employees would count heads of moviegoers and then collect the cash profits from the theaters. This process was known as sending "checkers and sweepers".

It features scenes from the film, news of the time and interviews, both from archive and purpose-made, with director [[Gerard Damiano]], actor [[Harry Reems]], actress [[Linda Lovelace]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[Larry Flynt]], [[Hugh Hefner]], [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], [[Erica Jong]], a prosecutor, Reems' defense, Mafia money collectors, and other people involved or just commenting on the film. Much of the material was compiled from approximately 800 hours of interview and archive footage collected by the filmmakers.

==Rating==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
''Inside Deep Throat'' was rated [[NC-17]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] for explicit sexual content; specifically, explicit excerpts from the original film. It was the first film rated NC-17 to be released by Universal since ''[[Henry &amp; June]]'' in 1990, which was the first film to receive the NC-17 rating. 

An edited version received an R rating for "strong [[Human sexual behavior|sexuality]] including graphic images, [[nudity]] and dialogue". In addition, [[Arrow Productions]] edited the original, pornographic version of ''Deep Throat'' to get an "R" rating, and also submitted the original for reclassification. Both reedited films were released theatrically in 2005 in a double-bill.

The '''Isabelline''' style, also called the '''Isabelline Gothic''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Gótico Isabelino''), or '''Castilian late Gothic''', was the dominant architectural style of the [[Crown of Castile]] during the reign of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], [[Queen Isabella I of Castile]] and King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] in the late-15th century to early-16th century. The Frenchman Émile Bertaux named the style after Queen Isabella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Annie Cloulas|title=Mélanges de la Casa de Velázquez|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CS1jRpHT40kC&amp;pg=PA159|volume=16|year=1980|publisher=Casa de Velázquez|location=Madrid|isbn=978-84-600-2213-8|page=159|chapter=Origines et évolution du terme "Plateresco"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Durliat1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel Durliat|title=L'Architecture espagnole|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5mtLAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22style%20Isabelle%22|year=1966|publisher=Privat-Didier|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It represents the transition between late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and early [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] architecture, with original features and decorative influences of the Castilian tradition, the [[Flanders|Flemish]], the [[Mudéjar]], and to a much lesser extent, Italian architecture. The consideration or not of the Isabelline as a Gothic or Renaissance style, or as an [[Eclecticism in architecture|Eclectic]] style, or as a phase within a greater [[Plateresque]] generic, is a question debated by historians of art and unresolved. &lt;ref&gt;"... is not satisfactory the supposedly enlightening the denomination of Gothic Plateresque, from the terminology adopted by D. Bayón for what Durliat called as Isabelline style and, as a binder of the one and the other (Marías), because if conceptually there is continuity, the ornamental repertoire used is very different, and there is no record of the use of the term for the medieval decorative fantasies. " Soto Caba, Virginia. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20120301233038/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/artesp/contextos/7626.htm ''The Platersque issue'']" in ''ArteHistoria''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Isabelline style introduced several structural elements of the Castilian tradition and the typical [[Flanders]]'s flamboyant forms, as well as some ornaments of [[Islamic]] influence. Many of the buildings that were built in this style were commissioned by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] or were in some way sponsored by them. A similar style called [[Manueline]] developed concurrently in [[Portugal]]. The most obvious characteristic of the Isabelline is the predominance of [[Heraldry|heraldic]] and [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] motifs, especially the symbols of the [[Coat of arms of the King of Spain|yoke and arrows]] and the pomegranate, which refer to the Catholic Monarchs. Also characteristic of this period is ornamentation using beaded motifs of orbs worked in plaster or carved in stone.

After the Catholic Monarchs had completed the [[Reconquista]] in 1492 and started the colonization of the Americas, imperial Spain began to develop a consciousness of its growing power and wealth, and in its exuberance launched a period of construction of grand monuments to symbolize them. Many of these monuments were built at the command of the Queen; thus Isabelline Gothic manifested the desire of the Spanish ruling classes to display their own power and wealth. This exuberance found a parallel expression in the extreme profusion of decoration which has been called [[Plateresque]].

References to classical antiquity in the architecture of Spain were more literary, whereas in Italy, the prevalence of Roman-era buildings had given 'Gothic' a meaning adapted to Italian classicist taste. Until the Renaissance took hold in the Iberian peninsula, the transition from the 'Modern' to the 'Roman' in Spanish architecture had hardly begun. These terms were applied with a meaning different from what one would expect now&amp;mdash; the 'Modern', an originally Spanish style, referred to the Gothic and its rational efficiency,&lt;ref&gt;Maroto, J. ''Historia del Arte'', Casals, {{ISBN|978-84-218-4021-4}}, pg. 195, citing, among others, to Diego de Sagredo ''Las Medidas del Romano'', 1526.&lt;/ref&gt; while the 'Roman' was the neoclassical or emotional and sensualist style of the [[Italian Renaissance]].

Regardless of the spatial characteristics of the interiors, Gothic buildings utilized proven structural systems. The Gothic style in the Iberian Peninsula had undergone a series of changes under the influence of local tradition, including much smaller windows which allowed the construction of roofs with substantially less pitch and even flat roofs. This made for a truly original style, yet more efficient construction. Spanish architects, accustomed to their Gothic structural conventions,  looked with some contempt on the visible metal braces that Italian architects were forced to put on their buildings' arches to resist horizontal thrust, while their own Gothic building methods had avoided this problem.

The development of classical architecture in the Iberian Peninsula, as elsewhere, had been moribund during the centuries of building construction done in the Gothic tradition, and the neoclassical movement of the Italian Renaissance was late to arrive there. A unique style with modern elements evolved from the Gothic inheritance in Spain. Perhaps the best example of this [[syncretistic]] style is the [[Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes, Toledo|Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes]] in Toledo; designed by the architect [[Juan Guas]], its Gothic ideals are expressed more in the construction than in the design of the interior space, as the relationship with original French Gothic building techniques had receded with the passage of time.

In the Isabelline style, decorative elements of Italianate origin were combined with Iberian traditional elements to form ornamental complexes that overlaid the structures, while retaining many Gothic elements, such as [[pinnacle]]s and [[Pointed arch#Architecture|pointed arches]]. Isabelline architects clung to the Gothic solution of the problem of how to distribute the weight burden of vaults pressing on pillars (not on the walls, as in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] or Italian Renaissance styles): that is, by propping them up with flying buttresses. After 1530, although the Isabelline style continued to be used and its decorative ornaments were still evolving, Spanish architecture began to incorporate Renaissance ideas of form and structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11392">'''James Thomas Hooper''' (1 September 1897 – 9 February 1971) was a British collector of ethnographic artifacts of the Inuit, Native American, Oceanic and African peoples.

Hooper was born in North Wraxall-Wiltshire&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Hooper, James Thomas | work = Danster Who's Who in African Art | url = http://www.danster-research.com/bin/who/htmlwho.cgi?search=2016213~01 | accessdate = 24 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1897 and began collecting in 1912 when his father gave him a native spear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = TOTEM MUSEUM video newsreel film  |publisher = British Pathe | url = http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=734 | accessdate = 22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became an employee of the Thames Conservancy Board&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hall |first=Michael |title=BOOK OF THE YEAR |work=Apollo Magazine |date=3 December 2007 |url=http://www.apollo-magazine.com/features/384731/book-of-the-year.thtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121101071045/http://www.apollo-magazine.com/features/384731/book-of-the-year.thtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 1 November 2012 |accessdate=22 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but collecting was his obsession. He scoured flea markets and small antique shops in rural England for items of interest as well as purchasing from auction houses, private museums and house sales. He also organised exchanges with other dealers and collectors such as [[William Ockelford Oldman]] and [[Kenneth Athol Webster]].

At the height of his collecting in the 1950s, he was one of the top four collectors of pacific ethnographic material in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Tatua (belt) | work = Collections Online |publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/ObjectDetails.aspx?oid=53958 | accessdate = 21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others included [[Kenneth Athol Webster]] and [[William Ockelford Oldman]]. Hooper's interest in collecting this material was ethnological rather than aesthetic. Like Oldman, Hooper never left Great Britain to visit the cultures that created the material he enjoyed.

After his retirement, Hooper opened the Totems Museum in Arundel, Sussex, United Kingdom in a two-story building on the High Street. He ran this museum between 1957 and 1963. The ground-floor rooms were packed full of his ethnographic collection while he and his grandson, Steven Hooper, lived in the rooms above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hooper | first = Steven | title = STEVEN HOOPER | work = Art and Divinity in Polynesia, 1760-1860 | url = http://www.quaibranly.fr/uploads/tx_gayafeespacepresse/MQB-DP-Polynesie-arts-divinites-1760-1860-EN.pdf | accessdate = 22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Pathe newsreel film dated 9 December 1957 follows a couple visiting the Totems Museum. While the film gives little information when describing the treasures of the museum, close attention to the background and general shots of the interior of the museum give an excellent insight into the size, diversity and quality of Hooper's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = TOTEM MUSEUM video newsreel film  |publisher = British Pathe | url = http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=734 | accessdate = 22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, he co-authored the publication ''The Art of Primitive Peoples'' with Cottie Arthur Burland. In it, Hooper concentrates on the [[art of Polynesia]], Melanesia, North Coast of America, Eskimo, West Africa and the Congo. His text is illustrated with 116 photographs of items from his collection taken by R.H. Bomback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The art of primitive peoples / by J.T. Hooper and C.A.

Hooper's collection continued to be documented after his death in 1971. His collection was the subject of a book by his grandson Steven Phelps – now known as Steven Hooper. ''Art and Artifacts of the Pacific, Africa and the Americas: The James Hooper Collection'' was published in 1976 and featured 250 illustrations. Soon after this book was published, parts of the collection began to be auctioned by Christie's. Between 1976 and 1982 there were at least six auctions of material from the James Hooper Collection. The auctions included ''African Art from the James Hooper Collection'' held on 14 July 1976 at Christie's London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = African Art from the James Hooper Collection | publisher = Christie's | date = 14 July 1976 | location = London | pages =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Indian Art from the James Hooper Collection'' held on 9 Nov 1976 at Christie's London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = American Indian Art from the James Hooper Collection | publisher = Christie's | date = 9 Nov 1976 | location = London | pages = , 207 lots auctioned, 207 lots illustrated | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hawaiian and Maori Art from the James Hooper Collection'' held on 21 June 1977 at Christie's London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Hawaiian and Maori Art from the James Hooper Collection | publisher = Christie's | date = 21 June 1977 | location = London | pages = 61, 203 lots auctioned, 196 lots illustrated | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Melanesian and Polynesian Art from the James Hooper Collection'' held on 19 June 1979 at Christie's London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Melanesian and Polynesian Art from the James Hooper Collection | publisher = Christie's | date = 19 June 1979 | location = London | pages = 63, 198 lots auctioned, 198 lots illustrated | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oceanic Art From the James Hooper Collection'' held on 17 June 1980 at Christie's London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Oceanic Art From the James Hooper Collection | publisher = Christie's | date = 17 June 1980 | location = London | pages = 56, 160 lots auctioned, 151 lots illustrated | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Important Tribal Art'' held on 7 July 1982 at Christie's London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Important Tribal Art from the properties of ...

'''''Kid 'n Play''''' is an animated cartoon series based on the real life hip-hop duo, [[Kid 'n Play]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5rfRdOMfTqsC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=The+Cartoon+Music+Book+kid+n+play&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFyOj74fXaAhWHKcAKHfpPCj0Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The+Cartoon+Music+Book+kid+n+play&amp;f=false|title=The Cartoon Music Book|first1=Daniel|last1=Goldmark|first2=Yuval|last2=Taylor|date=1 November 2002|publisher=Chicago Review Press|accessdate=8 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.41089/title.chris-kid-reid-reveals-kid-n-plays-dumbest-career-mistake-talks-narrating-nfl-show-undrafted#signup|title=Chris "Kid" Reid Reveals Kid 'n Play's Dumbest Career Mistake &amp; Talks Narrating NFL Show "Undrafted"|first=HipHopDX -|last=http://hiphopdx.com|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran for one season on [[NBC]] from September 8, 1990 to December 8, 1990. On the show, Kid 'n Play were portrayed as teenagers, but their recording careers remained the same as in real life, as did their character traits. Production was by [[Marvel Productions]] and Saban Entertainment.

The real Kid 'n Play appeared in live-action wraparounds of the cartoons, but voice actors took over for the animated versions of the duo.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The show stressed positive role models, teaching children how to get along with each other and stay out of trouble. Akin to the ''House Party'' films, Play was the less responsible member of the duo, cooking up get rich quick schemes, while Kid, the more responsible member, would usually be made to clean up messes. Oftentimes the issue would be resolved by the characters' girlfriends, or sometimes by an elderly jazz musician who wore a blue beret and was aptly named "Old Blue". The lessons ranged from serious to lighter fare. One of the "less serious" episodes dealt with Kid's father not understanding hip-hop and Kid not having the means to put it in a positive light, and Old Blue offers to help to sending Kid on a trip back in time to the era of jazz and speakeasies to help better understand its roots.

In 1992, [[Marvel Comics]] published a comic book based on the cartoon. The comic book ran for nine issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/i-love-ya-but-youre-strange-how-did-it-take-until-1992-for-kid-n-play-to-have-their-own-comic-book/|title=I Love Ya But You're Strange - How Did It Take Until 1992 For Kid 'n' Play to Have Their Own Comic Book?|date=10 March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was created by [[John Semper]] Jr. and [[Cynthia Friedlob]] who also served as the show-runners and head-writers. They would later go on to write Kid 'N Play's first live action feature film for a major studio, "CLASS ACT" for Warner Bros. Semper would later produce and be the head-writer for "Spider-Man: The Animated Series," for Marvel Films Animation.

'''Kim Jong-chul''' (18 February 1947 – 5 July 2014&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news|author=Yeoran Kim|title=‘못의 사제’ 김종철 시인, 하늘나라 순례에 오르다|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201407062104275&amp;code=100402|date=2014-07-06|accessdate=2016-11-23|publisher=[[Kyunghyang Shinmun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[South Korea]]n poet.&lt;ref name="mhj21"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mhj21.com/newnews/print.php?uid=8901|script-title=ko:&lt;북 리뷰&gt;김종철 시집 '못의 귀향' 장석원 시집 '태양의 연대기' |publisher=Munhwa Journal |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rose to fame in 1968 when he was awarded a prize by the Hankook newspaper for his poem ''Sound of a Loom''. In 1970 Kim won another prize with the Seoul Daily newspaper for his poem ''Drowned Dreams''. He is considered one of the most significant modern Korean poets.

Kim grew up in extreme poverty. He graduated with a degree in Korean Literature from ''Sorabol University of Arts'' in [[Seoul]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="mhj21" /&gt; In 1997 and 1998 he lectured poetry at [[Pyeongtaek University|PyeongTaek University]]. He is a member of the [[Society of Korean Poets]] and the [[Korean Writers Association]]. Among the many prizes Kim has won are the ''Dong-Joo Yoon Literary Prize'' (1990), the ''Nam-Myung Literary Prize'' (1992), the ''Pyun-Woon Literary Prize'' (1993) and the ''[[Jeong Jeong Jiyong Literature Prize]](2001)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okinews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=6216 |script-title=ko:김종철 시인「등신불」연작, 정지용 문학상 |publisher=Okcheon Sinmun |date=2001-05-05 |accessdate=2010-01-22 |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Kim's first publications generally explored basic human emotions. These are sometimes thought{{By whom|date=April 2017}} to be typical of Korean poetry. Basic emotions include: disappointment, sorrow, parting, illness, or grief. These emotions are considered ''basic'' since everyone naturally lives through these emotions as part of their life. This close relationship with everyday life, as well as the subtlety of the emotions are not only a characteristic of Korean poetry, but particularly of Kim Jong-Chul. Kim is considered{{By whom|date=April 2017}} exceptionally talented at moving the reader's heart when writing about these basic emotions. There are critics{{Who|date=April 2017}} who argue that this talent can be explained with Kim's biography which includes extreme poverty and growing up in war time. Because he was poor, Kim joined the army to serve in the [[Vietnam War]] voluntarily.

He continuously showed an interest in themes such as desperation, death, or poverty. Kim distanced himself from these motifs in his second collection of poetry, which had a more light-hearted approach to life matters.

In his third collection, Kim returned to darker motifs. This can be explained by Korea's long experience of military dictatorships between the 1960s and 1980s. He describes this time as "a period of universal tragedy."{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} With the coming of the 1990s, the political atmosphere in Korea changed. This was also reflected in some of Kim's poems. It seemed impossible to describe all life in terms of misery and tragedy. Kim continued to recognize the matter in trivial things. He frequently chooses the most mundane objects, such as a pumpkin, a nail or even a grain of rice.

His attitude is often linked with Kim's Roman Catholic faith. It is argued that this drives the author to search for the deeper meaning in everything, even if it appears trivial or insignificant. He hints at this in the preface of his fourth collection of poetry. There are some attempts to link his poems with Christian symbols, but this is frowned upon by others{{By whom|date=April 2017}}.

Kim gives profound meaning to everyday objects. It is this giving meaning to ordinary objects that some people{{Who|date=April 2017}} regard as a special ability of Kim Jong-Chul. Kim argues that there is no meaning in the objects themselves: "If all humanity were to disappear from this earth, a diamond would be nothing but a stone." This involvement with philosophical questions, such as of meaning, is often considered{{By whom|date=April 2017}} a departure from his earlier works. However, this also helped Kim to be viewed as one of the finest Korean poets of recent times.

==Works==
Kim has published a number of poetry collections:
* ''The Last Words of Seoul'' (1975)
* ''The Island of Wise Crows Island'' (1984)
* ''The Day Has Already Come'' (1990)
* ''Meditation on Nails'' (못에 관한 명상, 1992)&lt;ref name="mhj21" /&gt;

* ''Practice of Meeting in Dewdrops'' (1981)

}}
The '''Lisbon Recognition Convention''', officially the '''Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region''', is an international convention of the [[Council of Europe]] elaborated together with the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]]. As of 2012, the Convention has been ratified by all 47 member states of the Council of Europe in [[Strasbourg]] except for Greece and [[Monaco]]. It has also been ratified by the Council of Europe non-member states Australia, [[Belarus]], the [[Holy See]], Israel, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]] and New Zealand. Canada and the United States have signed but not ratified the Convention.

==Aims==
The Convention stipulates that [[academic degrees|degrees]] and periods of study must be recognised unless ''substantial differences'' can be proved by the institution that is charged with recognition. Students and graduates are guaranteed fair procedures under the Convention.
It is named after [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], where it was signed in 1997, and entered into force on 1 February 1999 (or later in some countries, subject to ratification date).

==Convention bodies==
The Convention established two bodies which oversee, promote and facilitate the implementation of the Convention:
# the Committee of the Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning [[Higher Education]] in the European Region, and
# the [[European Network of Information Centres]] on Academic Mobility and Recognition (the ENIC Network).

The Committee is responsible for promoting the application of the Convention and overseeing its implementation. To this end, it can adopt, by a majority of the Signatory Parties, recommendations, declarations, protocols and models of good practice to guide the competent authorities of the Parties. Before making its decisions, the Committee seeks the opinion of the ENIC Network. As for the ENIC Network, it upholds and assists the practical implementation of the Convention by the competent national authorities.

==Bologna Process==
The Lisbon Recognition Convention is an important instrument for the [[Bologna Process]] which aims at creating the "[[European higher education area]]" by making academic degree standards and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible throughout Europe.

==Historical background==
The possibility for students to study abroad has been recognised as an essential element of European integration since the foundation of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1949. Within the Council of Europe, several international treaties were elaborated in this field: starting with the right to education under Article 2 of the first Protocol of 1952 to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the European Convention on the Equivalence of Diplomas leading to Admission to Universities was opened for signature in 1953, the European Convention on the Equivalence of Periods of University Study in 1956, the European Convention on the Academic Recognition of University Qualifications in 1959, the European Agreement on continued Payment of Scholarships to students studying abroad in 1969, and the European Convention on the General Equivalence of Periods of University Study in 1990.

In addition, under Article 2 of the Council of Europe's European Cultural Convention of 1954, each Contracting Party shall, insofar as may be possible: encourage the study by its own nationals of the languages, history and civilisation of the other Contracting Parties and grant facilities to those Parties to promote such studies in its territory; and endeavour to promote the study of its language or languages, history and civilisation in the territory of the other Contracting Parties and grant facilities to the nationals of those Parties to pursue such studies in its territory.

'''Action film actors''' appear in [[action movie]]s, a [[film genre]] in which one or more [[hero]]es are thrust into a series of challenges that typically include physical feats, extended fight scenes, [[violence]], and frantic chases. Action films tend to feature a resourceful [[character (arts)|character]] struggling against incredible odds, which include life-threatening situations, a [[villain]], or a pursuit which generally concludes in victory for the hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= FILM; Battle of the Action Heroes|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=May 9, 1993|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/movies/film-battle-of-the-action-heroes.html?src=pm|accessdate=January 30, 2011|first=Rick|last=Marin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= FILM VIEW; SHORT ON TALK, BIG AT THE BOX OFFICE|work= The New York Times|date=December 2, 1984|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/02/arts/film-view-short-on-talk-big-at-the-box-office.html|accessdate=January 2, 2011|first=Janet|last=Maslin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A New Generation Of Macho Men|publisher= Sun |date=|url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-06-26/features/8802060717_1_smuggler-paul-hogan-heroes|accessdate=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9031">"'''Mr. Difficult'''", subtitled "[[William Gaddis]] and the problem of hard-to-read books", is a 2002 essay by [[Jonathan Franzen]] that appeared in the 9/30/2002 issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Franzen|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2002-09-30#folio=100|title=Mr. Difficult|work=The New Yorker|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was reprinted in the paperback edition of ''[[How to Be Alone (book)|How to Be Alone]]'' without the subtitle.

The essay describes the experience of being thought of as difficult by his readers and his own experience at reading difficult books.  Franzen then provides an extended commentary on most of Gaddis's novels.

The essay has attracted strong reactions.  Novelist [[Ben Marcus]] was hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Marcus|authorlink=Ben Marcus|url=http://harpers.org/archive/2005/10/why-experimental-fiction-threatens-to-destroy-publishing-jonathan-franzen-and-life-as-we-know-it/|title=Why experimental fiction threatens to destroy publishing, Jonathan Franzen, and life as we know it: A correction|work=Harper's|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Novelist [[Cynthia Ozick]] mentioned the Franzen/Marcus disagreement as part of a larger picture on the nature of reviewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Cynthia|last=Ozick|authorlink=Cynthia Ozick|url=http://harpers.org/archive/2007/04/literary-entrails/|title=Literary entrails: The boys in the alley, the disappearing readers, and the novel's ghostly twin|work=Harper's|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author and publisher [[Phil Jourdan]] was hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Thanks, Mr Franzen, I Like My Novels Difficult|last=Jourdan|first=Phil|authorlink=Phil Jourdan|website=LitReactor|url=http://litreactor.com/columns/no-thanks-mr-franzen-i-like-my-novels-difficult|date=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2013 review of Gaddis's letters described the literary significance of Gaddis by summarizing Franzen's essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It Ain’t Easy: William Gaddis’s Life in Letters|website=The New York Observer|url=http://observer.com/2013/02/it-aint-easy-william-gaddiss-life-in-letters/|last=Taylor|first=Justin|date=2013-02-26|accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mrs. M&amp;mdash;'s complaint==

The essay begins by describing some of the hostile reaction his third novel, ''[[The Corrections]]'', received.  One letter writer, identified as "{{nowrap|Mrs. M&amp;mdash;}} from Maryland", had a list of 30 vocabulary words (like "diurnality" and "antipodes") and some flowery phrases (like "electro-pointillist Santa Claus faces") from the novel that she did not approve of.  She asked who Franzen was writing for, since it was certainly not the "average person who just enjoys a good read."  She answered her question with what Franzen calls a caricature of him and his presumed readership.

Franzen finds himself ambivalent about his reaction to {{nowrap|Mrs. M&amp;mdash;}}.  He credits this ambivalence to his parents.  His father was an admirer of scholars, while his mother was anti-élitist.&lt;ref&gt;The use of an acute e is, of course, élitist.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Status and Contract models==
Franzen proceeds to summarize his ambivalence in terms of two models.

===The Status model===
:The "Status" model is presented as championed by [[Flaubert]].  It views writing to be an act of high art, best done by geniuses and whose worth has nothing to do with the opinion of the masses, who are doubtless philistines anyway.

===The Contract model===
:The "Contract" model presumes there is a specific audience of readers that the novel is meant for.  This can be narrow, like followers of ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', or wide, like the readers of [[Barbara Cartland]].  But the author has implicitly "contracted" to appeal to this circle of readers, and is to be judged on those grounds.

Franzen allows that it is quite possible for a novel to fulfill both models.  He mentions ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' and ''[[The House of Mirth]]''.  But he says that the models diverge when the novel is difficult.

In short, difficulty is a sign of success under the Status model, and a sign of failure under the Contract model.

Franzen then proceeds to list nine books that he has never been able to complete, including ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and ''[[Mason &amp; Dixon]]''.  (He will add to this list of unfinished books later in the essay.)  He then mentions the most difficult book that he has completed is ''[[The Recognitions]]''.

==Reading ''The Recognitions''==

Franzen then tells the story of how he came to read ''The Recognitions'' in the early 1990s (about the time he  published his second novel).  His previous year had been miserable from a writing point of view, with a failed screenplay.  Borrowing money, he left Philadelphia and moved into a Tribeca loft.  At some point, looking for distractions, Franzen purchased a copy of the Gaddis novel, and then made it his daily job, reading it six to eight hours a day for a week and a half.  He comments that the first two hundred pages were read partly out of professional curiosity, but that the rest were read out of love for the story, and that finishing the novel qualified as an act of virtue.

Franzen includes some commentary on the novel.  He also mentions that he failed to notice at the time the many parallels between the novel's main character and his own life and art.

==List of difficult authors==

Franzen returns back to how in college he was trained to read and admire complicated texts, finding fault with modern Systems, and his ambition became that of creating literary Art:
{{quote|I took for granted that the greatest novels were tricky in their methods, resisted casual reading, and merited sustained study.}}

Franzen then identifies 13 authors that he determined in his early post-college days as "a canon of intellectually, socially edgy, white-male American fiction writers" who "shared the postmodern suspicion of realism".  They are, listed in the order Franzen gave:
*[[Thomas Pynchon]]
*[[Joseph Heller]]
*[[Don DeLillo]]
*[[Robert Coover]]
*[[William Gaddis]]
*[[William Gass]]
*[[William Burroughs]]
*[[John Barth]]
*[[Donald Barthelme]]
*[[Barry Hannah]]
*[[John Hawkes (novelist)|John Hawkes]]
*[[Joseph McElroy]]
*[[Stanley Elkin]]

These are authors that, at the time, Franzen thought he wanted to write like.  He made a serious attempt to read these authors, but he never got more than a few pages into them (including ''The Recognitions'').  But he realized that the writers he liked to read were not the difficult ones with "academic and hipster respect."  Meanwhile, he continued writing his own version of difficult, System novels.

==Franzen and ''J R''==
Franzen jumps ahead to his later, successful reading of ''The Recognitions''.  He acknowledges it influenced him strongly, including his naming one of his novels ''The Corrections''.

Franzen tells how a few years later he then attempted to read ''[[J R]]''.  He had less free time, only putting in one or two hours a night.  Somewhere past the halfway point, he put the book down for too long a stretch, and then found it impossible to return to the novel.  He identifies his last connection to the novel: his bookmark is still on page 469.

Franzen isn't sure who to "blame" here.  He claims he thought of himself as the ideal Systems/Status reader, and for him to give up was like quitting a cult, as opposed to quitting a mainstream church, where people come and go all the time:
{{quote|Nothing in my Congregational experience had prepared me for the fanatical fervor, the guilt-provoking authority, of Mr. Difficult.}}

==In high-brow culture==

A book review of a new book by Joseph McElroy, one of the "hard-to-read 13" mentioned by Franzen, began by citing "Mr. Difficult" as if it were an essential credential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Essex|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2003-06-03/books/the-complications/|title=The Complications: Joseph McElroy's Uncompromising Positions|work=Village Voice'', review of ''[[Actress in the House]]''|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The review lavishly praises McElroy for maintaining his difficulty without a hint of compromise.

Online critics &lt;ref&gt;https://litreactor.com/columns/no-thanks-mr-franzen-i-like-my-novels-difficult&lt;/ref&gt; were particularly vocal following the essay's publication. One suggested that Jonathan Franzen was alone in disliking being challenged by books, and that most readers enjoy trying difficult books, for they are able to mentally enrich the reader.

The theme of Gaddis-versus-Franzen is part of the [[James Reiss]] poem "The Novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Reiss|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2012-11-19#folio=078|title=The Novel|work=The New Yorker|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The poem says that after Gaddis, the novel "didn't look back", but "... tramped past a bust of Jonathan Franzen."

[[Image:Artus2.jpg|thumb|King Arthur from ''The Book of Knowledge'', The Grolier Society, 1911]]
A '''mythological king''' is an [[archetype]] in [[mythology]]. A king is considered a "mythological king" if he is included and described in the culture's [[mythology]].  Unlike a [[fiction]]al king, aspects of their lives may have been real and legendary, or that the culture (through legend and story telling) believed to be real.  In the [[myth]], the legends that surround any historical truth might have evolved into symbols of "kinship" and leadership, and expanded with descriptions of spiritual, [[supernatural]] or magical chain of events. For example, in legend the king may have magical weapons and fight dragons or other mythological beasts. His [[archetype|archetypical]] role is usually to protect and serve the people.

==Archetypes of kings==
One mythological [[archetype]] is the "good king" (McConnel 1979), also sometimes called the "monarchical hero". The "good king" is often the [[epic hero]] who made his world safe for civilization.  Two examples that scholars have identified as filling the roles and earning the reputation of "good kings" were [[King Arthur]] and [[Beowulf]], above and beyond their legendary and historic lives.

Beowulf for example is a mythological king in training in the [[Epic poetry|epic]] tradition, because he fights "a strenuous battle against the disorganization of the universe." (McConnel 1979:59) Another is the great king "Oxthar", a leopard headed man that journeyed to the mythical underworld of Palulu (which is the supposed place where the sun goes to rest at night) and stole glowing stones from the bed of the sun to give light and power to his people.

==Mythemes of kings==
Some [[mytheme]]s and cultural belief systems that are explored through myths about kings include: what is the source of the king's power, what is the training he must go through, what tests of courage does he pass, what are the battles he must fight, and what are the effects of taking power.

In [[epic poetry|epics]] of war,  source of power is often having physical skills above ordinary men, owning "magical" weapons and political alliances.

In spiritual mythologies the king's power may come from a spiritual source and also spiritual weapons. In romantic and contemplative myths his power and success may from internal personality traits, such as from courage, wisdom and self-restraint.

Another common theme is the king's wounds, sacrifice and (sometimes) death for the betterment of the people. The [[Fisher King]] is an example of theme of the "wounded king."

One other theme to be aware of in [[storytelling]] and mythology is that the king's health is often symbolic of the health of the kingdom or society: For example, a sick king means a weakened and vulnerable society, a healthy king means a healthy society,  an emotionally or physically distant king means the society is in danger. Also, the installation of kings at the New Year was believed to renew the [[cosmos]]: "The king becomes in a manner responsible for the stability, the fecundity and the prosperity of the entire Cosmos." (Eliade 1963:41)

{{expand Russian|Новый русский|date=October 2012}}

The '''New Russians''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|новые русские}} ''Novye Russkie'') were newly rich business class in post-Soviet Russia. It is perceived as a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[caricature]]. According to the stereotype, "New Russians" achieved rapid wealth by using criminal methods during [[History of Russia (1991–present)#Reforms|Russia's chaotic transition to a market economy]].

Having a modest education and social background, New Russians are perceived as arrogant ''[[nouveau riche]]'' and gaudy, [[conspicuous consumption|conspicuous consumers]] with poor taste. Money and status symbols are prominently displayed by the New Russian, in particular jewelry and luxury cars. In the early 1990s, prominent attributes of the New Russian stereotype also included [[mobile phones]] and crimson jackets.  A wide range of elite restaurants and nightclubs catering to the New Russian social circle have sprung up in Moscow.

== Etymology ==

The expression Новый Русский (lit. "New Russian") arose in the Russian-speaking sphere in the demonstrated English-language form of "New Russian", and was then calcified into the Russian-language form.&lt;ref name="Костомаров"&gt;Костомаров В. Г. [http://www.pinkrus.ch/cgi/kyr.pl?f=NR&amp;c=9785865470700&amp;t=temartic_ru Языковой вкус эпохи.

Вып. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Another sparse theory suggests the term appeared in foreign press, and then made its way into Russia. Supporters of this theory consider that the author of the expression was the American journalist [[Hedrick Smith]] who published two books about Russia: "The Russians" (1976) and "The New Russians" (1990).&lt;ref name="Сафонова"&gt;Сафонова Ю. А. Новые русские (заметки об одном новом фразеологизме) // Russistik. — 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

There's also a theory that it's more of a pun, playing on the French words "nouveau riche" (i.e. new rich),&lt;ref name="Сафонова"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Эрлих, Сергей Ефроимович|Эрлих С. Е.]] [http://stratum.ant.md/ 05_99/articles/erlih/erlih06.htm Россия колдунов-2 (Раскопки сакрального текста)] {{недоступная ссылка|число=26|месяц=05|год=2013|url=http://stratum.ant.md/|id=20061016}} // [http://stratum.ant.md/  STRATUM plus] {{недоступная ссылка|число=26|месяц=05|год=2013|url=http://stratum.ant.md/|id=20061016}}. – 1999. – [http://stratum.ant.md/ 05_99/index.htm № 5 (Неславянское в славянском мире).] {{недоступная ссылка|число=26|месяц=05|год=2013|url=http://stratum.ant.md/|id=20061016}} – С. 469—500.&lt;/ref&gt; having an absolutely similar meaning as the term "New Russian". 

In the documentary film "With a hard-sign on the end" (С твёрдом знаком на конце, dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the creation of the newspaper [[Kommersant|Коммерсантъ]], and shown on [[Channel One Russia|Channel One]] on 30 November 2009), author [[Leonid Parfyonov|Leonid Parfenov]] demonstrates a copy of Kommersant from 1992 where editorial statistics were addressed as "New Russian". Parfenov confirms that the newspaper first implemented this word into daily life, and at first didn't have any negative or ironic connotation, merely annotating the representatives of nascent Russian businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.yandex.ru/users/woodyalex/view/8/ Ролик недоступен&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attributes ==

Characteristic attributes of 1990s New Russians are considered:

* Red or crimson jacket – distinguishing style of clothes for ostentatious people, status symbol (likewise a symbol of tastelessness), black jeans of a popular brand, steel-toed black boots. In the words of the gameshow player Andrei Kozlov from "[[What? Where? When?]]", New Russians began wearing crimson jackets after their appearance on this gameshow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1tv.ru/sprojects_edition/si5867/fi27428 «Сегодня вечером», 23 ноября 2013 года]&lt;/ref&gt; Although, there is another version of appearance of crimson jackets – in 1993 [[Sergey Mavrodi]], founder of financial pyramid [[MMM (Ponzi scheme company)|MMM]] greeted nation with New Year – 1994. And he wore crimson jacket in this instance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTVeAfMHgIE]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Massive gold chains around the neck ("golda"), gold chains worn outside.
* A weighty gold [[Seal (emblem)#Signet rings|signet ring]] ("nut")
* Large watches ("cauldrons") of an expensive brand, preferably solid gold and with expensive stones
* The automobile: [[Mercedes-Benz W140|Mercedes-Benz 600]] model with the W140 body ("six-hundredth Mers", "600th [[Gelding|Merin]]", "Suitcase", "Bandit", "Boar", "the one-forty"), [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] ("Chirik", "Cherkan", "Jeep", "Zhyp", "Cherokez", and the close-pair Широкий "Wide"), [[Nissan Terrano]] ("Tiranka"), [[Mitsubishi Pajero]] ("Podzhary"). [[Toyota Land Cruiser]] ("Cruzak", and "Kukuruzer" a play on the Russian word for corn), [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|Mercedes Geländewagen]] ("Gelik", "Cubic"), [[Chevy Tahoe|Chevrolet Tahoe]] ("Coffin"), [[Volvo 940]], [[Mercedes-Benz W124]], [[BMW 5]], [[BMW 7]] ("Bimmer, {{IPA|/ˈbumʲɪr/|lang=ru}}"), [[Audi 100]], [[Lincoln Town Car]]
* Mobile phone (труба "trumpet/pipe/tube", "mobila", сотовик "celly"), until the beginning of the 2000s, considered an item of luxury and prestige
* A buzz cut or shaved head or back-of-the-head ("репа" "turnip") &lt;!-- source needed&lt;ref&gt;Amongst New Russians, however, there were not only bald and shavedheaded.&lt;/ref&gt; ..of course "not only", but speaking mostly of stereotypes --&gt;
* The "[[Sign of the horns|sign of the horns hand]]" gesture, with or without thumb extended ("fingers", "fingering", "finger goat").
* Use of New Russian [[jargon]] (words such as "like-a", "in nature", "cleanly", "concretely", "anyway", and so on). [[Fenya|Thief-cant]].
* "Cabbage" – wads of [[cash]] in [[USD|US dollars]], or money in general ("bucks", "babki", "bablo", "green", "lave")

== In modern society ==

"New Russians" became by conventional wisdom, the heroes of a multitude of anecdotes appearing in various films, plays, and broadcasts. The archetype itself repeatedly progressed and other spheres and walks of life (see: [[:ru:Новые Русские Бабки|New Russian Bucks]]). Also in the year 1996, the program [[:ru:Джентльмен-шоу|Gentleman-Show]] had "Vovan Sidorovich Scherbatyy" as a guest performed by actor [[:ru:Школьник, Олег Львович|Oleg Shkolnik]].

Many [[Russian jokes]] revolve around New Russians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4550">'''Norma Khouri''' is the pen name of author '''Norma Bagain Toliopoulos''' (born '''Norma Bagain''' in [[Jordan]] in 1970). She is the author of the book titled ''Honor Lost'' (titled ''[[Forbidden Love (novel)|Forbidden Love]]'' in Australia, Britain, and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations). The book was published by [[Random House]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/23/1090464851887.html?oneclick=true|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2007-05-21|date=2004-07-24|title=The lies stripped bare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book, which became a [[bestseller]], purported to describe the [[honor killing]] of her best friend in Jordan. After criticism from Jordanian writers and groups in regards to numerous errors, the book was exposed as a [[Literary forgery|literary hoax]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=newspaper&gt;{{cite news|last=Knox|first=Malcolm|title=Bestseller's lies exposed|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/23/1090464854793.html|accessdate=18 June 2011|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=24 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Khouri was born in [[Jordan]] in 1970, and moved to [[Chicago]] in the [[United States]] with her parents in 1973. She attended a Catholic school in South Chicago.

In 1993 she married John Toliopoulos, the father of her two children, Zoe and Christopher. In about 2001, Khouri, Toliopoulos and their children moved to [[Australia]], from where she published a non-fiction account of the honour killing of her best friend in Jordan. After the revelation of her literary hoax made headline news, she moved back to the United States. She is the subject of the acclaimed 2007 film ''[[Forbidden Lie$]]''.

==''Forbidden Love'' hoax==
On July 24, 2004 [[Malcolm Knox (author)|Malcolm Knox]], literary editor of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', revealed that Khouri was not living in Jordan during 1993-1995 (the timeframe of ''Forbidden Love''), but was living in Chicago with her husband, John Toliopoulos, and her two children. She had not lived in Jordan since her early childhood, except for a three-week stay during which she apparently researched the background for her book. Knox further revealed accusations that Khouri had left the United States while being investigated for defrauding an elderly neighbor.

Things were further complicated for [[Random House|Random House Australia]] because Khouri was sponsored under the category of nomination for distinguished talent in 2002. On July 28, 2004 the Australian [[Department of Immigration and Citizenship (Australia)|Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs]] announced that Khouri was cleared of violating visa conditions, but Khouri had already left the country of her own accord.

Khouri said she would co-operate with all requests to provide documentation and was said to be preparing to publish her next book ''A Matter of Honour'' in November 2004, again by Random House; it appears that this book was not released, as on August 18, 2004, Khouri admitted publicly that she took "literary licence" with the book, claiming that she did not receive any payment or royalties for writing it.

'''Oberon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|b|ər|ɒ|n}}) is a king of the [[fairy|fairies]] in [[Middle ages|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] literature. He is best known as a character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', in which he is [[King consort|Consort]] to [[Titania]], Queen of the Fairies.&lt;ref name="Rose1996"&gt;{{cite book | title = Spirits, Fairies, Leprechauns and Goblins: An Encyclopedia | last = Rose | first = Carol | publisher = W.W. Norton |location= New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-393-31792-7 | chapter = M | page = 207 |oclc=554956069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merovingian legend==
{{Confusing|reason=the etymology which refers to elf instead of fairy|section|date=July 2016}}

Oberon's status as king of the fairies comes from the character of [[Alberich]] (from [[Old High German]] ''alb-'' "elf" and ''-rîh-'', "ruler", "king"), a [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] in the legendary history{{which|date=May 2013}} of the [[Merovingian]] dynasty. In the legend, he is the otherworldly "brother" of [[Merowech]], whose name is the [[:wikt:eponym|eponym]] of the Merovingians but whose actual existence is unproven. Alberich wins for his eldest son, Walbert, the hand of a princess of [[Constantinople]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', a [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundian]] poem written around the turn of the 13th century, Alberich guards the treasure of the [[Nibelung]]en, but is overcome by [[Sigurd|Siegfried]].

==French heroic song==
The name Oberon is first attested to in the early 13th century ''[[chanson de geste]]'' entitled ''Les Prouesses et faitz du noble [[Huon de Bordeaux]]'', wherein it refers to an elven man of the forest encountered by the eponymous hero. Huon, son of Seguin [[count of Bordeaux]], passed through the [[enchanted forest|forest]] inhabited by Oberon. He was warned by a [[hermit]] not to speak to Oberon, but his courtesy had him answer Oberon's greetings, and so gain his aid in his [[quest]]. Huon had killed Charlot, the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor's]] son, in self-defense, and so he must visit the court of the [[amir]] of [[Babylon]] and perform various feats to win a pardon. He succeeds only with Oberon's aid.

This [[elf]] is dwarfish in height, though very handsome. He explains that, at his christening, an offended fairy cursed him to dwarfish height (an example of the [[wicked fairy godmother]] folklore motif) but relented and gave him great beauty as compensation. Alberich features as a dwarf in the ''Nibelungen''; the dwarfish height was thus explained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katharine Mary Briggs|Katharine Briggs]], ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures,'' "Huon de Bordeaux", p. 227. {{ISBN|0-394-73467-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seguin II of Gascony|real Seguin]] was Count of Bordeaux under [[Louis the Pious]] in 839, and died fighting against the [[Normans]] in 845. [[Charles l'Enfant]], a son of [[Charles the Bald]], died in 866 of wounds inflicted by a certain ''Aubouin'' in the circumstances of an ambush similar to the ''Charlot'' of the story. Thus, Oberon appears in a 13th-century French courtly fantasy that is based on a shred of 9th century fact. He is given some Celtic trappings, such as a magical cup (similar to the [[Holy Grail]]) that is ever full for the virtuous. "The magic cup supplied their evening meal; for such was its virtue that it afforded not only wine, but more solid fare when desired", according to [[Thomas Bulfinch]]. In this story, he is said to be the child of [[Morgan le Fay]] and [[Julius Caesar]].

A manuscript of the romance in the city of [[Turin]] contains a prologue to the story of ''Huon de Bordeaux'' in the shape of a separate romance of Auberon and four sequels, and there are later French versions, as well.

Shakespeare saw or heard of the French heroic song through the {{circa|1540|lk=no}} translation of John Bourchier, Lord Berners, called ''Huon of Burdeuxe''. In [[Philip Henslowe]]'s diary, there is a note of a performance of a play ''Hewen of Burdocize'' on 28 December 1593.

[[File:Shakespeare's comedy of A midsummer-night's dream (1914) (14729845086).jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of Oberon enchanting Titania by [[W. Heath Robinson]], 1914]]
In William Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' Oberon is the king of all of the fairies and is engaged in a dispute with his wife Titania, the fairy queen. They are arguing over custody of a child whom Oberon wants to raise to be his henchman. Titania wants to keep and raise the child for the sake of her mortal friend and follower who died giving birth to him. To make it look as if he didn't disappear, Titania put a [[Changeling|fairy]] in his place. 

Because Oberon and Titania are both powerful spirits connected to nature, their feuding disrupts the weather. Titania describes the consequences of their fighting:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vains,
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
Have every pelting river made so proud
That they have overborne their continents:
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
The human mortals want their winter here;
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
That rheumatic diseases do abound:
And thorough this distemperature we see
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
The childing autumn, angry winter, change
Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
By their increase, now knows not which is which:
And this same progeny of evils comes
From our debate, from our dissension;
We are their parents and original.
&lt;/poem&gt;|source=''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Act&amp;nbsp;2, Scene&amp;nbsp;1}}

Oberon tricks Titania into giving him back the child using the juice from a special flower that makes you "madly dote upon the next live thing that it sees". The flower was accidentally struck by Cupid's arrow when he attempted to shoot a young maiden in a field, instead infusing the flower with love. Oberon sends his servant, Puck, to fetch the flower, which he does successfully.

Furious that Titania will not give him the child, he puts juice from a magical flower into her eyes while she is asleep. The effect of the juice will cause Titania to fall in love with the first live thing she sees. Titania awakens and finds herself madly in love with Bottom, an actor from the [[rude mechanicals]] whose head was just transformed into that of a donkey, thanks to a curse from Puck.

Meanwhile, two couples have entered the forest: Lovers Hermia and Lysander are pursued by Demetrius, who also loves Hermia, and Helena, who loves Demetrius. Oberon witnesses Demetrius rejecting Helena, admires her amorous determination, and decides to help her. He sends Puck to put some of the juice in Demetrius's eyes, describing him as “a youth in Athenian clothing”, to make him fall in love with Helena. Puck finds Lysander &amp;ndash; who is also a youth wearing Athenian clothing &amp;ndash; and puts the love potion on Lysander's eyes. When Lysander wakes, he sees Helena first and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Demetrius has also been anointed with the flower and awakes to see Helena, pursued by Lysander, and a fight breaks out between the two young men. Oberon is furious with Puck, and casts a sleeping spell on the forest, making Puck reverse the potion on Lysander, admonishing Puck to not reverse the effects on Demetrius. Both couples awake and begin the journey back to Athens.

Oberon now looks upon Titania and her lover, Bottom, and feels sorry for what he has done. He reverses the spell using a magic herb. When she wakes, she is confused, thinking that she had a dream. Oberon explains that the dream was real, and the two reunite happily. They then return to Athens in the epilogue to bless the couples, becoming once again the benevolent fairy king and queen.

[[File:Purcell portrait.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait of Purcell engraved by R.White after Closterman, from the second edition of volume I, London: William Pearson 1706]]
'''''Orpheus Britannicus''''' is a collection of [[song]]s by [[Henry Purcell]], published posthumously in [[London]] in two volumes, the first in 1698 and the second in 1702. In the preface to the first volume, [[Henry Playford]], the printer of the volume and the son of the famous [[John Playford]], extolls Purcell's skill as setter of English texts.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, 2. Domestic vocal music&lt;/ref&gt;

The portrait on the frontispiece was based on [[John Closterman]]'s portrait of Purcell, currently in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;For the original painting, see [http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp03677&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=sit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, 8. Portraits&lt;/ref&gt;

The first publication of a section of Purcell's opera ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' was the air "Ah! Belinda" in ''Orpheus Britannicus'', transposed up one step, from C to D.&lt;ref&gt;Dido and Aeneas&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Hall (poet)|Henry Hall]], who had studied composition with Purcell under [[John Blow]], wrote the dedicatory poems at the beginning of each volume, (1698 and 1702) and also wrote one for Blow's ''Amphion Anglicus''.&lt;ref&gt;Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

The later 1706 London printing of ''Orpheus Britannicus'' by [[William Pearson (printer)|William Pearson]] utilized a new style of music printing to great success, where the notehead was in one piece with the background staff.&lt;!--this could probably be explained better--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Printing and Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=August 2011}}

John Blow's ''Amphion Anglicus'' (1700), a collection of Blow's songs, excerpts from odes, and [[chamber music]], was published by subscription, after ''Orpheus Britannicus''' success, and even shows a certain symmetry in title.&lt;ref&gt;Blow&lt;/ref&gt;

A later engraver, [[Cole Benjamin]] (''fl'' 1740–1760), printed as ''Orpheus Britannicus'' a seemingly unrelated set of engravings which he had made originally for ''The New Universal Magazine'' (1751–9).&lt;ref&gt;Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Britten]], working with [[Peter Pears]],&lt;!--Just out of interest, was Britten's version intended for Pears? Did he sing any of them?--&gt;
realized and edited a number of songs from ''Orpheus Britannicus'' for both solo singer with piano and solo singer with orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Britten&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">[[File:Pocket-knife.jpg|thumb|A simple penknife.]]

A '''penknife''', or '''pen knife''', is a British English term for a small folding [[knife]].&lt;ref name="EB1770-1"/&gt; Today the word ''penknife'' is the common British English term for both a [[pocketknife]], which can have single or multiple blades, and for [[multi-tool]]s, with additional tools incorporated into the design.&lt;ref name="Moore1988"/&gt;

Originally, penknives were used for thinning and pointing [[quill]]s to prepare them for use as [[dip pen]]s and, later, for repairing or re-pointing the [[Nib_(pen)|nib]].&lt;ref name="EB1770-1"/&gt; A penknife might also be used to sharpen a [[pencil]],&lt;ref name="Machen1895"/&gt; prior to the invention of the [[pencil sharpener]]. A penknife did not necessarily have a folding [[blade]], but might resemble a [[scalpel]] or [[wood knife]] by having a short, fixed blade at the end of a long handle. One popular (but incorrect) [[folk etymology]] makes an association between the size of a penknife and that of a small [[ballpoint pen]].

During the 20th century there has been a proliferation of multi-function knives with assorted blades and gadgets, including; [[stitching awl|awls]], [[reamers]], [[scissors]], [[nail files]], [[corkscrew (tool)|corkscrews]], [[tweezers]], [[toothpicks]], and so on. The tradition continues with the incorporation of modern devices such as [[ballpoint pens]], [[LED]] torches, and [[USB flash drives]].&lt;ref name="Shackleford2010"/&gt;

The most famous example of a multi-function penknife is the [[Swiss Army knife]], some versions of which number dozens of functions and are really more of a folding [[multi-tool]], incorporating a blade or two, than a penknife with extras.&lt;ref name="Shackleford2010"/&gt;

A larger folding knife, especially one in which the blade locks into place, is often called a [[claspknife]].&lt;ref name="Shackleford2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13870">'''Phra Lak Phra Ram''' (&lt;big&gt;ພຣະລັກພຣະຣາມ&lt;/big&gt;, pʰrāʔ lāk pʰrāʔ ráːm) is the national epic of the Lao people, and is adapted from Valmiki's Hindu epic, the ''[[Ramayana]].'' Ramayana reached Laos much later than Cambodia and Thailand (Siam) which caused the loss of its original Hindu influence and affected local adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Phralak Phralam|url=http://phralakphralam.com/phralak_phralam_en/le-phralak-phralam/les-personnages/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to some Malay versions of the ''[[Hikayat Seri Rama]]'', the epic has lost the association with Hinduism and is instead considered a Jataka Story, a previous lifetime of the Buddha. It is also very popular in some parts of Northeastern Thailand, or [[Isan]], a region of Thailand populated by a large number of Lao-speaking people and formerly part of [[Lane Xang|Lanxang]].

==Names==

''Phra Lak Phra Ram'' is named after two principal characters, the brothers ''Phra Lak'', or [[Lakshaman]], and ''Phra Ram'', or [[Rama]]. Since ''Phra Ram'' is considered the hero, it is believed the altered name was chosen for euphony. Veteran dance performers of Luang Prabang, however, say that ''Phra Lak'' comes first in deference to his voluntary assistance of ''Phra Ram,'' whose actions were obligatory to his kingship.&lt;ref&gt;Jähnichen, G. (2009). Re-designing the role of phalak and pharam in modern Lao Ramayana. Wacana Seni Journal of Art Discourse, 8, p 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it also considered a Jataka tale, it is referred to as ''Phra Ram Xadôk'' (&lt;big&gt;ພຣະຣາມຊາດົກ&lt;/big&gt;, pʰrāʔ ráːm sáː dók). It was also called ''Rammakien'' (&lt;big&gt;ຣາມມະກຽນ&lt;/big&gt;, Ráːm māʔ kian), but this the name for this other regional varieties in the ''Ramayana'' in general.

==Introduction to Laos==

Lao legends attribute to the introduction of the ''Phra Ram Xadôk'' via the first king of Lane Xang, Chao Fa Ngoum, who arrived with his soldiers, artists, dancers, concubines, poets from musicians from [[Angkor]] who would have been familiar with the Reamker. Yet Indic civilizations knew of what is now Yunnan in China, as "Gandhara" no later than the second century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, K. R. S. (2006). Asian variations in ramayana. New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi. p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hindu culture]], language and religion spread into that part of the world incident to the [[Satavahanas#Cultural achievements|cultural achievements of the Sahavahana]]s (230 BC–AD 220.) Though definitive dates cannot be established for the [[Peopling_of_Laos#Gradual_Tai_inland_migration_from_China|gradual Tai inland migration from China]], transmission of the epic likely occurred much sooner than the traditional date. Tai tribes definitely settled on the fringes of highly Indianized kingdoms of the Mon and Khmer culture, adopting much of Indic learning and knowledge. As those kingdoms receded, the Lao came to venerate the earlier Hindu temples, often decorated in [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]] motifs, such as at [[Vat Phou]] in [[Champasak Province|Champassak]].

Earlier versions remained somewhat similar to other versions, but by the 18th century, the versions are completely localised. Although Theravada Buddhism was known to the Mekong River Tai tribes as early as the 7th or 8th century B.C., it wasn't until the 14th or 15th centuries that a re-invigorated Theravada Buddhism supplanted earlier animist, Hindu, or Mahayana Buddhist loyalties.&lt;ref&gt;Saveda, A. (1994). Laos: a country study. [Replaces 1971 version.]. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Library of Congress. Retrieved from http://countrystudies.us/laos/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles, I. (2007). Buddhism, power and political order. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This would have also seen introduction of the Dasaratha Jataka, an ancient Buddhist crystallisation of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Richman, P. (1991). p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th century, the manuscripts are completely adapted to Lao culture and Theravada Buddhist religion.&lt;ref&gt;p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==

Although the Hindu nature of the ''[[Ramayana]]'' epic was lost in Laos, it was not completely erased. Indra, Shiva, and Brahma are present in the ''Phra Ram Xadôk.'' Lao culture has always been oral and visual, and oral tales were often codified into elaborate dance-dramas by the royal courts. Great influence in dance came from Khmer, Thai, and even Javanese culture, with a slight native flair. In ''khône'' and ''lakhone'' dance-dramas, the symbolism, costumes, and story are also more attuned to and influenced by Hindu Khmer, Thai, and even Javanese traditions.

Some versions explicitly announce that it is a Jataka tale, while others are generally assumed to be so. Phra Lak and Phra Ram are the epitome of moral leadership, ethics, selflessness, and living true to dharma. Pha Ram is associated with a previous life of Siddartha Gautama, while his cousin Hapmanasouane (Ravanna) is often compared to Buddha's cousin ''[[Devadatta|Phra Thevathat]]'' or Buddha's final impasse to enlightenment, ''Phra Man''. The parallels include their religious knowledge and generally moral superiority but also their ruin by greed and desire.&lt;ref&gt;Richman, P. (1991). Many rāmāyaṇas: the diversity of a narrative tradition in south asia. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hampanasouane as [[Mara (demon)|Mara]], the personification of worldly desires who tried to tempt the Buddha during meditation, can be seen in both their searches for lust, power, and material gain. The cosmology and some elements are taken from the Tripitaka, such as the greater role of Indra vis-à-vis Shiva, and Indra asking riddles of religion and Buddhist thought to a young Hapmanasouane.&lt;ref&gt;Richman, P. (1991). pp. 62-73&lt;/ref&gt; Although important, religiously, it is subordinate to the greater and more chronologically recent Jataka tales of Phra Vet and the annals of the lifetime of Siddhartha Gautama.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, J. (2009). Spirits of the place: Buddhism and Lao religious culture. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animistic elements are not as apparent in the ''Phra Lak Phra Ram'', but it is noteworthy to point out that the scenery takes place along the Mekong River. She is a great goddess and ancestral spirit that is as sacred and quintessentially 'theirs' as the [[Ganges]] is to India and a personification of water, bounty, and life. It was also the [[Phaya Naga|King of the Nagas]] that suggested Phra Ram's father move the capital from Maha Thani Si Pan Phao (modern-day [[Nong Khai]], Thailand) across the bank to Chantaboury Sri Sattanak (modern-day [[Vientiane]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tinh, V. T. (1971). Phra lak phra Ram: a previous life of the buddha [Published on-line 2003.]. (Adapted from text of Vat Kang Tha.), Retrieved from http://www.seasite.niu.edu/lao/otherTopics/PhralakPhralam/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Like most animistic elements, the [[Nāga]] is seen in both Buddhist and Hindu-influenced contexts, but worship of nagas predates Indian influence in the region, and are common in folktales of Laos and Isan. A unique version of the ''Phra Lak Phra Ram'', the ''Khwai Thoraphi'' focuses very much on Sankhip and Palichane's fight with the water buffalo. It was often read at temple, probably in Buddhism's attempt to replace Lao spirit propitiation ceremonies that involved water buffalo sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, K. R. S. (2006) pp. 237-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on culture and art==

The importance of ''Phra Lak Phra Ram'' to Lao culture can be seen in how ubiquitous it is. It is a mainstay of dance and drama, song, painting, sculpture, religious texts, and manuscripts. It is also seen in the more common arts, such as classical [[morlam]], folklore, and village dances.&lt;ref&gt;p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes from court dancers were performed on Lao New Year celebrations, and other Buddhist holidays. The texts are commonly read during sermons. And the tales themselves have been deeply interwoven into local folklore, myth, and legend. Sculpture, lacquerware, carvings, and paintings adorn temples and palaces. The chapters have been intricately crafted into song and dance and accompanying music. Through the Buddhist elements, Lao beliefs of morality and karma are re-affirmed. The first half of Lao versions also establish the mythology for the creation of the Lao polities, land features, and waterways, and it serves as a transmission of culture.

===Versions===

====Textual====
Due to the fragile nature of organic matter in hot, humid weather, most of these texts have been mostly lost or destroyed. Nevertheless, several texts have been uncovered at Vat Phra Kèo in Vientiane, Vat Kang Tha in Ban Bo Ô, Ban Naxone Tay, Ban Hom, and Vat Nong Bon, in Laos; Roi Et in Thailand, now housed in Bangkok; and a manuscript of the Vientiane version in Phnom Penh. Of these, only Ban Hom and Ban Naxone Tay have complete versions preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Jähnichen, G. (2009), pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two modern printed editions exist. The most noted is Sachchidanda Sahai's version, mostly based on the Vat Phra Kèo version. It was printed in 1973 by the patronage of the Indian Embassy in Vientiane.&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, K. R. S. (2006). Asian variations in ramayana. New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi. p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese scholar Vo Thu Tinh also published a 1972 version adapted from the manuscript of Vat Kang Tha, and is depicted at Vat Oup Muong in Vientiane. This version has been criticised for being too simplified.&lt;ref&gt;Giteau Madeleine. Note sur des sculptures sur bois de Luang Prabang représentant des scènes du Rāmāyaṇa. In: Arts asiatiques. Tome 45, 1990. pp. 67-75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jähnichen, G. (2009), pp.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sister texts====
In addition to the Phra Lak Phra Ram, other similar stories are known from Laos.

*Phrômmachak

'''''Playing God''''' was a 2012 BBC documentary in the ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' series, hosted by [[Adam Rutherford]]. The documentary discusses [[synthetic biology]], the potential of science "breaking down nature into spare parts" and then rebuilding it back up as we wish.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web | title=Playing God | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01b45zh| work=Horizon | publisher=BBC | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Adam Rutherford has been studying the emerging field of synthetic biology for the past 10 years and believes that this sort of genetic tinkering is the most effective way to pass along traits between different organisms, given that this result cannot be easily obtained through typical mating of certain species. In ''Playing God'', he discusses the creation of the spider-goat by American researchers. It is a part goat, part spider hybrid, whose genetic code has been altered to be able to produce the same proteins found in spider silk. The milk produced by these goats can be used to create an artificial spider's web.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jan/14/synthetic-biology-spider-goat-genetics|title=Synthetic biology and the rise of the 'spider-goats'|last=Rutherford|first=Adam|date=2012-01-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically this silk is produced in small quantities by spiders but with the genetic modification of the goats, it may be mass produced. The goats are easier to handle in large groups than spiders and thus this could potentially increase the efficiency of silk production and consumer cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This technology is also being used to make bio-diesel to power cars. Biotech company, Amyris, in Emeryville, California, has applied synthetic biology to yeast. Instead of producing alcohol through the fermentation of sugar, this yeast produces diesel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The amount of diesel that is produced by this method is substantially greater than that of the conventional method and can exponentially increase the rate of production. This diesel has already been implemented in actual cars, in Brazil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other researchers are looking at how we might, one day, control human emotions by sending 'biological machines' into our brains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; MIT professor Ed Boyden leads a group in synthetic neuroscience. This team utilizes the genetic code for molecules that convert light into electrical energy and inserts it in a virus or cassette that may be installed into various organisms. Because the brain works on electrical impulses, this technology may be applied to neural circuits, in order to treat various neurological disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With this technology, the direct control of various light sensitive and electrical functions in the brain would be enabled.

MIT professor, Ron Weiss, has worked extensively in this field and has been leading a team in incorporating the concepts of computer programming and engineering to biology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "I decided to take what we understand in computing and apply that to programming biology. To me, that's really the essence of synthetic biology."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Weiss' team published a study that discusses how they combined computer circuit elements with BioBricks parts. The way this works is that the computer circuit is able to distinguish between a healthy and mutated cell by utilizing a set of five criteria. Any cells that satisfy these conditions are deleted, similar to the way code could eliminate certain functions in computer programming. The ability to target individual cells could make this an alternative to treatments that may have harmful effects on healthy cells, such as chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Scientific Concepts ==
The area of synthetic biology is extensively discussed in ''Playing God''. This is considered to be a relatively new field that incorporates elements of engineering into biology.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bio.org/articles/synthetic-biology-explained|title=Synthetic Biology Explained - BIO|website=BIO|language=en|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the blending and manipulation of natural molecules and unnatural molecules to obtain a specific outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://syntheticbiology.org/FAQ.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021212065409/http://syntheticbiology.org/faq.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2002-12-12|title=Synthetic Biology: FAQ|website=syntheticbiology.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this mean, scientists may use biology as a base for the development of synthetic life and genetic coding.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This area of study has been noted with the potential to increase the efficiency of the production of certain biomolecules and naturally occurring materials, such as enzymes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Reception ==
''Playing God'' and presenter, Adam Rutherford, have been subject to criticism following the release of this documentary. As plainly stated by [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/andrew-marszal/ Andrew Marszal] of ''The Telegraph'', "Rutherford overcooked it, particularly in his opening gambit – the revelation that scientists have developed a new hybrid breed of 'spider-goats'... we were left a little disappointed as Freckles, Pudding and Sweetie chomped and grazed around the farm looking for all the world like, well, goats."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9020873/Horizon-Playing-God-BBC-Two-review.html|title=Horizon: Playing God, BBC Two, review|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrayal of the applications of synthetic biology in this documentary appeared to be exaggerated and their importance not adequately stressed. The Alliance for Natural Health International (ANHI) wrote a reaction piece in which it expressed concern about the overwhelmingly positive tone the documentary as a whole had towards the development of this technology. "The programme was almost wholly positive about the new technology, even though it has many serious potential consequences for humans and the planet... Dr Rutherford reacts like a kid in a sweetshop at each new technological marvel.  Not once does he question whether creating spider-goats is necessary, or whether the ‘trickle-down’ of genetic engineering into the community is a step too far." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anhinternational.org/2012/01/26/playing-god-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/|title=‘Playing God’: What could possibly go wrong?|date=2012-01-26|website=Alliance for Natural Health International|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7938">'''''Princess Belle-Etoile''''' is a French literary [[fairy tale]] written by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]].&lt;ref&gt;Madame d'Aulnoy, ''Contes Nouveaux ou Les Fees a la Mode'' [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/aulnoy/1892/princessbelleetoile.html "Princess Belle-Etoile"]&lt;/ref&gt; Her source for the tale was ''[[Ancilotto, King of Provino]]'', by [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 220, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 707 ''The dancing water, the singing apple, and the speaking bird''.

==Synopsis==
[[Image:Princess Belle-Etoile 2 - illustration by Walter Crane - Project Gutenberg eText 18344.jpg|thumb|The children of Queen Blondine and sister Brunette picked up by a Corsair after seven days at sea; illustration by Walter Crane]]

A queen was reduced to poverty, and to selling sauces to support herself and her three daughters.  One day, an old woman came to them and begged that they feed her a fine meal.  They did so, and the woman, being a [[fairy]], promised that the next time they wished something without thinking of her, it would come true.  For a long time, they could not make a wish without thinking of her, but one day, the king came by.  The oldest daughter, Roussette, said that if she married the king's admiral, she would make sails for all his ships; the second, Brunette, that if she married the king's brother, she would make him [[lace]] enough to fill a castle; the third, Blondine, that if she married the king, she would bear him two sons and a daughter, who would have golden chains about their necks and stars on their foreheads, and jewels would fall from their hair.

A favorite repeated their words to the king, who summoned the sisters, and soon the marriages were concluded.  A splendid wedding feast appeared out of nowhere, served on golden dishes, and the women realized it was from the old woman.  Roussette hid the dishes when they left, but they were turned to [[earthenware]] when she arrived.

The king's mother was furious to hear that her sons had married such lowly women. Roussette was jealous of her sisters. Brunette gave birth to a son, and died. Blondine gave birth to two sons and a daughter, and the queen and Roussette put three puppies in their place. They took the children, including Brunette's, and gave them to a maid, who scrupled to kill them, but [[Child abandonment#In fiction|put]] them in a boat, with necklaces that might pay for their support if someone found them.  The queen was sent back to her mother.

The [[fairies]] guarded the boat until it fell in with a [[pirate ship]].  The captain brought them to his childless wife. When they found that jewels fell from the children's hair, the captain gave up his [[piracy]], because he would be rich without it.  They named the princess Belle-Etoile ([[French language|French]] for "Beautiful Star"); her older brother, Petit-Soleil ("Little Sun"); her younger, Heureux ("Happy"); and their cousin, who did not have the chain or star but was more beautiful than his cousins, Chéri ("Darling").

As Belle-Etoile and Chéri grew up, they fell in love, but believing themselves brother and sister, deeply regretted it.  One day, she overheard the pirate and his wife talking, and learned where they had come from.  She told her brothers and cousin, and they told the pirate and his wife that they wished to leave.  The pirate implored them to stay, but Heureux persuaded him that they wondered too much about their birth to endure it.  They set sail in a marvelous ship.  It arrived at the castle of the king their father, and the king marveled over them.  They asked only for a house in which to stay.

The [[Queen Mother]] realized from the description that these were her grandchildren. She sent the maid who had failed to drown them, and the woman told Belle-Etoile that she needed the dancing water, which would keep her from ever looking old. She told that story, and Chéri set out at once, against her will. He found a spring and rescued a dove from drowning. It set all sorts of animals that burrow to dig up the dancing water, and Chéri returned with it. He freed the dove and it flew off rather sulkily.
[[Image:Princess Belle-Etoile - illustration by Walter Crane - Project Gutenberg eText 18344.jpg|thumb|Princess Belle-Etoile rescues Prince Cheri, in an illustration by [[Walter Crane]]]]
The maid came back with a tale of a singing apple, and Chéri once again set out.  This time, a reading stranger directed him to the apple, and by helping a wounded dove, he gained the knowledge of the dragon that guarded it, and how it could be frightened off by mirrors, and returned with the apple.

The maid returned with a tale of a little green bird that knew everything.  Belle-Etoile was deeply distressed by this, as she realized it could tell her who their parents were, and where they came from. Chéri set out again, but when he had nearly reached the bird, the rock opened, and he fell into a hall and was transformed into stone. Belle-Etoile fell ill from her distress at his absence, and Petit-Soleil set out to find Chéri, but suffered the same fate, and then Heureux did the same.

Belle-Etoile set out after them, and rescued a dove from snow.  It advised her not to climb the mountain where the bird perched, but to sing below it, and lure it down. She did so, and the bird advised her on how to free her brothers and all the rest of the prisoners.

Meanwhile, the [[Queen Mother]] had persuaded the king to have his marriage to Blondine set aside, and marry again.  Roussette persuaded the queen to invite Blondine to the wedding.  The king invited the four children, and left a gentleman to await their arrival.  The gentleman, on their arrival, told them the king's story.  Belle-Etoile and her brothers arrived for the wedding, bringing their treasures, told how they were abandoned, and showed them to the king.  Finally, the king asked the green bird who these children were, and where they came from.  The bird proclaimed that they were the king's children and nephew.

The [[Queen Mother]], Roussette, and the maid were all punished, and instead of marrying himself, the king married his daughter Belle-Etoile to Chéri.

==See also==
"[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]", "[[The Wicked Sisters]]", and "[[The Tale of Tsar Saltan]]" include the three sisters' marriages, and the sisterly hostility, though it is unusual to see only one sister [[evincing]] it. ("[[The Three Little Birds]]" is even more unusual, in that the oldest sister is the heroine and victim of her sisters.) "[[The Bird of Truth]]" begins with the children already abandoned, through the hostility of nobles to a low-born queen, but follows the same plot thereafter. "[[The Water of Life (Spanish fairy tale)|The Water of Life]]" sends the children after the treasures while omitting the motive to be rid of them; they only wish to make their home pleasant, and the one who told them had no ulterior motive.

The hostility from the [[mother-in-law]] is also found in "[[The Boys with the Golden Stars]]".  It is a common [[Motif (literature)|motif]] in other fairy tales, not of this form:  Perrault's version of "[[Sleeping Beauty]]", and "[[The Six Swans]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7589">'''''READ 180 is a''''' reading intervention program in wide use by students in Grades 4–12 who read at least two years below grade level. It was created by [[Scholastic Corporation]]. In 2011, Scholastic released its newest version, '''''READ 180'' Next Generation''', which has been fully aligned to meet the demands of the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]].&lt;ref name="R180"&gt;[http://read180.scholastic.com/reading-intervention-program A webpage] about READ 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholastic sold READ 180 to [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmhco.com/media-center/press-releases/2015/april/scholastic-acquisition#sthash.uQY0qwGH.dpuf  Houghton Mifflin Harcourt to Acquire Scholastic’s Educational Technology and Services Business for $575 Million]&lt;/ref&gt;

== How It Works ==
''READ 180'' is based on a blended instructional model that includes whole-group instruction and three small-group rotations, adaptive software, [[differentiated instruction]], and [[independent reading]].

The program has three different versions: Upper Elementary (Grades 4–5), Middle School (Grades 6-8), and High School (Grades 9–12).

== Placement ==
The Scholastic Reading Inventory (SRI) is a technology-based universal screener and progress monitor.  SRI is used to generate a [[Lexile]], or [[readability]] level, for each student. The purpose of administering the SRI is to determine if the student is a candidate for intervention. SRI is software that “assesses students’ reading levels, tracks students’ growth over time, and helps guide instruction according to students’ needs.” &lt;ref name="SRI"&gt;[http://teacher.scholastic.com/products/sri_reading_assessment/index.htm A webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213080038/http://teacher.scholastic.com/products/sri_reading_assessment/index.htm |date=2012-12-13 }} about SRI.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Components ==
''READ 180'' is a reading intervention program that provides individualized instruction to meet each student’s reading needs.  The technology collects data based on individual responses and adjusts instruction to meet each students’ needs at their level, accelerating their path to reading mastery.&lt;ref name="R180Research"&gt;[http://read180.scholastic.com/pdf/research/1_2011_ResearchFoundationPapers_R180NG_READ180.pdf A PDF] Research Foundation Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers begin and end each class session with whole-group instruction. Next students break into one of three rotations.  First, the teacher leads small-group instruction, using the ''READ 180'' worktext called the ''rBook'', teachers monitor reading and differentiate instruction based on students’ needs. Second, students work independently in the ''READ 180'' software. The software leads students through five Learning Zones: the Reading Zone, the Word Zone, the Spelling Zone, the Success Zone, and the Writing Zone. Third, the students read independently in Independent Reading. Students select from the ''READ 180'' paperback or audiobook library and read a [[fiction]] or [[nonfiction book]] (or eRead).&lt;ref name="R1802"&gt;[http://read180.scholastic.com/about/instructional-model A webpage] regarding how ''READ 180'' is used.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
''READ 180'' is the result of research that began in 1985 with the work of Dr. Ted Hasselbring and members of the Cognition and Technology Group at [[Vanderbilt University]]. With a grant from the [[United States Department of Education]]’s Office of Special Education, Dr. Hasselbring developed software that used student performance data to individualize and differentiate the path of computerized reading instruction.&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;[http://read180.scholastic.com/pdf/research/read180_Heritage_of_Research_.pdf A PDF] READ 180: A Heritage of Research.&lt;/ref&gt; This software became the prototype for the READ 180 program.

Between 1994 and 1998, Dr. Hasselbring and his team put their work to the test in [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]], Florida. The Orange County Literacy Project used this ''READ 180'' prototype with more than 10,000 struggling students. The dramatic results Orange County public schools experienced were documented in the ''Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness''.&lt;ref name="Slavin"&gt;[http://research.scholastic.com/sites/default/files/publications/READ180_ProfessionalPaper_MTSS_2012.pdf A PDF] An Alignment Guide.&lt;/ref&gt; These results led Scholastic to partner with Orange County public schools and [[Vanderbilt University]] to license the software, and to launch ''READ 180''. 

After the initial launch of ''READ 180'', Scholastic released Enterprise Edition in 2006 in collaboration with Dr. Kevin Feldman and Dr. Kate Kinsella. ''READ 180'' Enterprise Edition featured the ''READ 180'' ''rBook'', structured engagement routines for [[English language learners]], and the Scholastic Achievement Manager (SAM).&lt;ref name="Research"&gt;[http://read180.scholastic.com/pdf/research/1_2011_EfficacyStudy_ResearchCompendium2011_READ180.pdf Compendium of ''READ 180'' Research ] History of ''READ 180''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==
A number of studies have been conducted regarding the [[effectiveness]] of using ''READ 180''  in the classroom. The company's [[webpage]] includes a searchable list of research articles. 

Below is a sample of some of the current research available on ''READ 180''. 

The U.S. Department of Education Striving Readers Project shows ''READ 180'' effective in combating adolescent illiteracy.&lt;ref name="Striving"&gt;[http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/node/517 A Press Release] Research Shows ''READ 180'' Effective in Combating Adolescent Illiteracy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Educational Science (IES) What Works Clearinghouse recognized ''READ 180'' for potentially positive effects in comprehension and general literacy achievement. 
&lt;ref name="WWC"&gt;[http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/node/258 A Press Release] What Works Clearinghouse Confirms Scholastic Read 180 Works.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavin, Cheung, and Groff, and Lake (2008) placed ''READ 180'' in a select group of [[adolescent]] literacy programs that showed more evidence of effectiveness than 121 other programs reviewed.

Harty, Fitzgerald, and Porter (2008) indicated that ''READ 180'' can be successfully implemented in an afterschool setting. 
Lang, Torgesen, Vogel, Chanter,  Lefsky, and Petscher (2009) published a study which indicated that ninth-grade students enrolled in ''READ 180'' exceeded the benchmark for expected yearly growth on the [[Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test]]. 

De La Paz (1997) documented the foundational research conducted by Dr. Ted Hasselbring and his team from [[Peabody College]] at [[Vanderbilt University]].

'''Robert Dale Owen''' (November 7, 1801 – June 24, 1877) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born social reformer who immigrated to the United States in 1825, became a U.S. citizen, and was active in [[Indiana]] politics as member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] (1835–39 and 1851–53) and represented Indiana in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] (1843–47). As a member of Congress, Owen successfully pushed through the bill that established [[Smithsonian Institution]] and served on the Institution's first Board of Regents. Owen also served as a delegate to the [[Constitution of Indiana#Constitutional Convention 2|Indiana Constitutional Convention]] in 1850 and was appointed as U.S. ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'' (1853–58) to [[Naples]].

Owen was a knowledgeable exponent of the socialist doctrines of his father, [[Robert Owen]], and managed the day-to-day operation of [[New Harmony, Indiana]], the socialistic utopian community he helped establish with his father in 1825. Throughout his adult life, Robert Dale Owen wrote and published numerous pamphlets, speeches, books, and articles that described his personal and political views, including his belief in [[spiritualism]]. Owen co-edited the ''New-Harmony Gazette'' with [[Frances Wright]] in the late 1820s in Indiana and the ''Free Enquirer'' in the 1830s in [[New York City]]. Owen was an advocate of married women's property and divorce rights, secured inclusion of an article in the [[Constitution of Indiana#Constitution of 1851|Indiana Constitution of 1851]] that provided tax-supported funding for a uniform system of free public schools, and established the position of [[Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction]]. Owen is also noted for a series of open letters he wrote in 1862 that favored the abolition of slavery and supported general emancipation, as well as a suggestion that the federal government should provide assistance to freedmen.

==Early life and education==
Robert Dale Owen was born on November 7, 1801, in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], to Ann (or Anne) Caroline Dale and [[Robert Owen]]. His mother was the daughter of [[David Dale]], a Scottish textile manufacturer; his Welsh-born father became part-owner and manager of the New Lanark Mills, his father-in-law's textile mill at [[New Lanark]], Scotland.&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite web| author= | title =Robert Owen Timeline | work = | publisher =Robert Owen Museum | date =2008 | url = http://robert-owen-museum.org.uk/time_line| format = | accessdate =29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GS269-70&gt;{{cite book | author=Linda C.

Owen grew up in Braxfield, Scotland, and was privately tutored before he was sent at the age of sixteen to [[Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg]]'s school at Hofwyl, [[Switzerland]]. The Swiss school exposed Owen to [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]'s method of education.

Owen's father, a successful textile manufacturer and philanthropist, became a noted socialist reformer whose vision of social equality included, among other projects, the establishment of experimental utopian communities in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Dale Owen, who shared many of his father's views on social issues immigrated to the United States in 1825, became a U.S. citizen, and helped his father manage the socialistic community at [[New Harmony, Indiana]].

==Early career==
Between 1825 and 1828, Owen managed the day-to-day operations of the socialistic community at New Harmony, Indiana, while his father returned to Britain to resume his social reform and philanthropic work in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his other work, Owen and [[Frances Wright]], a wealthy, Scottish philanthropist and radical reformer, published articles in the ''New-Harmony Gazette'', the town's liberal weekly newspaper, and served as its co-editors. Established in 1825, the ''Gazette'' was one of Indiana's earliest newspapers; however, it ceased publications in February 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Pitzer, "Why New Harmony is World Famous," p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the New Harmony utopian community dissolved in 1827, Owen traveled in Europe before returning to the United States in 1829. During this period Owen wrote ''Moral Physiology; or, A Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question'' (1830), a controversial pamphlet on the topic of population control.&lt;ref name=PL145&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first book in the United States to advocate birth control.&lt;ref name=Pitzer12&gt;Pitzer, "Why New Harmony is World Famous," p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen moved to [[New York City]], where he and Wright co-edited the weekly ''Free Enquirer'' until 1831–32.&lt;ref name=BrownTandy54-55&gt;{{cite journal| author=Allison Brown and Kisha Tandy | title =To Be Morally Just: Robert Dale Owen and Abolitionism | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =26  | issue =3 | pages=54–55 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Summer 2014| url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Owen, Robert Dale|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they had done in the ''New Harmony Gazette'', the ''Free Enquirer'' continued to express their radical views on a variety of subjects, including abolition of slavery, women's rights, universal suffrage, free public education, birth control, and religion. Owen returned to New Harmony, Indiana, in 1833, after he and Wright discontinued their editorship of the New York newspaper.&lt;ref name=BrownTandy54-55/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Owen and Mary Jane Robinson were married before a justice of the peace on April 12, 1832, in New York City. After an extended trip to Europe, they relocated to New Harmony, Indiana. The couple had six children, two of whom died at an early age. Their surviving children were Florence (b. 1836), Julian Dale (b. 1837), Ernest (b. 1838), and Rosamond (b. 1843).&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, pp. 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 1876, five years after the death of his first wife, Owen married Lottie Walton Kellogg at Caldwell, New York; he died a year later.&lt;ref name=PL106/&gt;

==Politician and statesman==

===Working Men's Party leader===
During 1829–30, Owen became an active leader in the [[Working Men's Party]] in [[New York City]]. In contrast to other [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] of the era, Owen was opposed to [[slavery]], although his radical partisanship distanced him from the leading [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Lott |title=Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|location=New York|page=129|isbn=9780199717682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indiana legislator===
After Owen's return to New Harmony, Indiana, in 1833, he became active in state politics.&lt;ref name=BrownTandy54-55/&gt; Owen served in the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] (1835–38; 1851–53).&lt;ref name=CongBio/&gt; He distinguished himself as an influential member of the [[Indiana General Assembly]] during his first term by securing appropriations for the state's tax-supported public school system.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt; In addition, Owen was instrumental in introducing legislation and argued in support of widows and married women's property rights, but the bill was defeated. He also proposed laws granting women greater freedom of divorce.&lt;ref name=Pitzer12/&gt;

In addition to serving in the state legislature, Owen was elected as a delegate from [[Posey County, Indiana]], to the [[Constitution of Indiana#Constitutional Convention 2|Indiana Constitutional Convention]] in 1850.&lt;ref name=Estabrook72-74&gt;Estabrook, pp. 72–74.&lt;/ref&gt; At the convention, Owen initiated a proposal to include provisions for women's property rights in the state' constitution. Although it was not approved, this early effort to protect women's rights led to later laws that were passed to secure women's property, divorce, and voting rights.&lt;ref name=PL22&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Owen's lasting legacies was his authorship and efforts to secure the inclusion of an article in the [[Constitution of Indiana#Constitution of 1851|Indiana Constitution of 1851]] that provided state funding for a uniform system of common schools that are free and open to all and established the office of the state's superintendent of public instruction.&lt;ref name=PL56-57&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Congressman===
After his first term in the Indiana legislature and two unsuccessful campaigns for election to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in 1838 and in 1840, Owen was elected as a Democrat to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1842. He served from 1843 to 1847 in the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Congresses. Owen was chairman of the Committee on Roads and Canals during the Twenty-eighth Congress. He was also involved in the debates about the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] and an [[Oregon boundary dispute]] in 1844 that led to the establishment of the U.S-British boundary at the [[49th parallel north]], the result of the [[Oregon Treaty]] (1846).&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

While serving as a member of Congress, Owen introduced and helped to secure passage of the [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] that founded the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1846.&lt;ref name=Hafertepe15-17&gt;{{cite book | author=Kenneth Hafertepe | title =America's Castle: The Evolution of the Smithsonian Building and Its Institution, 1840–1878 | publisher =Smithsonian Press  | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1984 | location =Washington, D.C. | pages =15–17 | url =  | isbn =0-87474-500-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen was appointed to the Smithsonian Institution's first Board of Regents and chaired its Building Committee, which oversaw the construction of the [[Smithsonian Institution Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and recommended [[James Renwick, Jr.]] as architect, James Dixson and Gilbert Cameron as the contractors, and the [[Seneca Quarry]] for its distinct, dark-red sandstone.&lt;ref&gt;Hafertepe, pp. 17, 27, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robertdaleowenindiana.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Dale Owen as he appeared in his later years.]]

Owen, his brother [[David Dale Owen]], and architect [[Robert Mills (architect)|Robert Mills]], were involved in developing preliminary plans for the Smithsonian Building. These early plans influenced Renwick's choice of the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival architectural style]] (sometimes referred to as [[Norman architecture|Norman-style]] architecture) and his three-story design for the building, which was finally selected, although not without controversy.&lt;ref name="Hafertepe, p. 47, 60–61"&gt;Hafertepe, p. 47, 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen's book ''Hints on Public Architecture'' (1849) argued the case for the suitability of Renwick's Romanesque Revival (Norman) architectural style for public buildings such as the Smithsonian "Castle," which he discussed in detail. Seven full-page illustrations and details of the building's architectural elements were prominently featured in the book, leading some to criticize Owen for his bias toward Renwick and his preference for Norman-style architecture over other popular styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Smithsonian Castle and the Seneca Quarry|author=Garrett Peck |year=2013 |publisher=The History Press |pages=43–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hafertepe, pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. diplomat===
Owen was defeated in his bid for re-election to Congress in 1846; however, he remained active in public service and was once again elected to serve in the Indiana General Assembly.&lt;ref name=CongBio/&gt; On May 24, 1853, while Owen was serving as a state legislator in Indiana, President [[Franklin Pierce]] appointed him as U.S. minister (''[[Chargé d'Affaires]]'' and Minister Resident) to the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] at [[Naples]].&lt;ref name="RobertDaleOwenState1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/owen-robert-dale |title=Robert Dale Owen|work=Department History |publisher=[[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], Office of the Historian|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen served in the diplomatic post until September 20, 1858, and then retired from political life, although he remained actively interested in public affairs and social reform issues.&lt;ref name=CongBio/&gt;

===Other political activities===
During the [[American Civil War]], Owen served in the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Commission]] to supply the [[Union Army|Union army]]; on March 16, 1863, he was appointed to the Freedman's Inquiry Commission. The commission was a predecessor to the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 Owen wrote a series of open letters to U.S. government officials, including President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Salmon P. Chase]], to encourage them to support general emancipation. Owen's letter of July 23, 1862, was published in the ''New York Evening Post'' on August 8, 1862, and his letter of September 12, 1862, was published in the same newspaper on September 22, 1862. In another open letter that Owen wrote to President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] on September 17, 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Dale Owen's Letter to President Lincoln | work =|  
 publisher=University of Evansville | date=
|url=http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/bstud/lincoln.html |accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
he urged the president to abolish [[slavery]] on moral grounds. Owen also believed that emancipation would weaken the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces and help the Union army win the war.&lt;ref name=BrownTandy54-55/&gt; On September 23, 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary version of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, pp. 87–89, and note 15, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; (as he had first resolved to do in mid-July&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/alhtml/almintr.html | title=Emancipation Proclamation | publisher=Library of Congress and Knox College | work=Lincoln Papers | year=2002 | accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In ''Emancipation is Peace'', a pamphlet that Owen wrote in 1863, he confirmed his view that general emancipation was a means to end the war. In ''The Wrong of Slavery, the Right of Emancipation, and the Future of the African Race'', a report that Owen wrote in 1864, he also suggested that the Union should provide assistance to freedmen.&lt;ref name=BrownTandy54-55/&gt;

Toward the end of his political career, Owen continued his effort to obtain federal voting rights for women. In 1865 he submitted an initial draft for a proposed [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] that would not restrict voting rights to males. However, Article XIV, Section 2, in the final version of the Amendment, which became part of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] in 1868, was modified to limit suffrage to males who were U.S. citizens over the age of twenty-one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| title =The Constitution: Amendments 11–27 | work = | publisher =National Archives and Records Administration | date = | url = https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/amendments-11-27 | format = | accessdate =September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritualism==
In ''The authenticity of the Bible'' (1833), Owen remarked&amp;nbsp;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For a ''century and a half'', then, after Jesus' death, we have no means whatever of substantiating even the existence of the Gospels, as now bound up in the New Testament. There is a perfect blank of 140 years; and a most serious one it is.&lt;ref name=Authenticity&gt;{{cite book|author=Origen Bacheler and Robert Dale Owen|title=Discussion on the Existence of God, and The Authenticity of the Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RPUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA247|year=1833|publisher=A.J. Matsell|page=247|quote=For a ''century and a half'', then, after Jesus' death, we have no means whatever of substantiating even the existence of the Gospels, as now bound up in the New Testament. There is a perfect blank of 140 years; and a most serious one it is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Like his father, Owen converted to [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] and was the author of two books on the subject: ''Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World'' (1859) and ''The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next'' (1872).&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Although he retired from active public service at the conclusion of his work as a member of the Freedman's commission on May 15, 1864, Owen continued his writing career.&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Major writing projects in retirement included ''Beyond the Breakers'' (1870), a novel;&lt;ref name=PL149&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next'' (1871), one of his two books on spiritualism;&lt;ref name=PL149/&gt; and ''Threading My Way'' (1874), his autobiography.&lt;ref name=Threading&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert Dale Owen | coauthors =|title=Threading My Way: Twenty-seven Years of Autobiography |publisher=G. W. Carleton and Company | series = | volume = | edition =|year=1874|location=New York | pages = |url=https://archive.org/details/threadingmywayt01owengoog | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen also wrote several articles that were published in the ''Atlantic Monthly'' and ''Scribner's Monthly''.&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875 Owen suffered a mental breakdown that was severe enough for him to be hospitalized at the [[Central State Hospital (Indiana)|Indiana Hospital for the Insane]] in [[Indianapolis]], where he underwent three months of treatment. Owen recovered from the illness, was released from the hospital, and resumed writing.&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, pp. 104–5.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 23, 1876, a year before his death, Owen married Lottie Walton Kellogg at Caldwell, New York.&lt;ref name=PL106/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
On June 24, 1877, Owen died at his summer home at Crosbyville on [[Lake George (town), New York|Lake George, New York]]. Initially he was buried in the town of [[Lake George, New York|Lake George]] in [[Warren County, New York]].&lt;ref name=CongBio/&gt; Later, his remains were exhumed and interred at New Harmony, Indiana, beside his first wife, Mary Jane Owen.&lt;ref name=PL106/&gt;

One of Owen's most significant legacies in Indiana was to secure the inclusion of an article in the Indiana Constitution of 1851 that provided tax-supported funding for a uniform system of free public schools and established the position of [[Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction]].&lt;ref name=PL56-57/&gt; His early efforts to protect women's rights were another of his political legacies.&lt;ref name=BrownTandy54-55/&gt; Although he was unsuccessful in adding provisions to protect women's rights to Indiana's state constitution of 1851, his efforts paved the way for others to follow. Eventually, Indiana laws granted women's property and voting rights, as well as greater freedom in divorce.&lt;ref name=PL22/&gt;

As a U.S. Congressman, Owen introduced federal legislation that founded the Smithsonian Institution in 1846.&lt;ref name= Hafertepe15-17/&gt; He was also a member of the Smithsonian Institution's first Board of Regents and its Building Committee. His vision for the Smithsonian Institution Building, along with the preliminary plans and suggestions made by his brother, David Dale Owen, and architect Robert Mills, influenced architect James Renwick Jr.'s design for the Romanesque Revival-style building in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Hafertepe, p. 47, 60–61"/&gt;

Owen's impact on the issues of slavery and emancipation is less direct. In a series of open letters he wrote in 1862 and in publications that followed, Owen encouraged the abolition of slavery on moral grounds, supported general emancipation, and suggested that the federal government should provide assistance to freedmen.&lt;ref name=BrownTandy54-55/&gt; Some historians have concluded that these open letters and Civil War-era pamphlets "helped immeasurably to solidify public opinion" in favor of emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and tributes==
The town of [[Dale, Indiana]] was named in Owen's honor.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;{{cite book |author=Burford, William|title=Yearbook of the State of Indiana for the Year 1919|publisher=Legislative Bureau Division of Accounting and Statistics and The State Board of Accounts|location=Indiana |year= 1920|pages=|isbn= |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1911, the women of Indiana dedicated a [[Robert Dale Owen Memorial|memorial]] to Owen on the grounds of the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis that included a bronze bust of the statesman created by [[New Castle, Indiana]] native Frances Goodwin. The bust of Owen disappeared in the early 1970s; only its pedestal remains.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glory-June Greiff | title =Remembrance, Faith and Fancy: Outdoor Public Sculpture in Indiana | publisher =Indiana Historical Society Press | year =2005 | location =Indianapolis | page=165 | isbn =0-87195-180-0}} See also: {{cite web |publisher=Indiana Department of Administration |format=pdf |url=http://www.in.gov/idoa/files/WebPageSelfGuide6.pdf |title=The Indiana Statehouse: A Self-Guided Tour |accessdate=27 October  2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614094418/http://www.in.gov/idoa/files/WebPageSelfGuide6.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}

In the [[phonology]] of the [[Romanian language]], the [[phoneme]] inventory consists of seven [[vowel]]s, two or four [[semivowel]]s (different views exist), and twenty [[consonant]]s. In addition, as with all languages, other phonemes can occur occasionally in interjections or recent borrowings.

Notable features of Romanian include two unusual diphthongs {{IPA|/e̯a/}} and {{IPA|/o̯a/}} and the central vowel {{IPA|/ɨ/}}.

==Vowels==
[[File:Romanian vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.13|Romanian vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Sarlin|2014|p=18}}. The non-native vowels {{IPA|/y, ø, ɵ/}} are not shown.]]
There are seven [[monophthong]]s in Romanian:&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2001|p=7"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2001|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Close back rounded vowel|Close back rounded]]
| ''uda'' {{IPA|/uˈda/}} ('to wet') &lt;br&gt; ''aduc'' {{IPA|/aˈduk/}} ('I bring') &lt;br&gt; ''simplu'' {{IPA|/ˈsimplu/}} ('simple')
|-

|}

Although most of these vowels are relatively straightforward and similar or identical to those in many other languages, the [[close central unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɨ/}} is uncommon as a phoneme&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2001|p=7"/&gt; and especially uncommon amongst [[Indo-European languages]].

According to {{Harvcoltxt|Sarlin|2014}}, {{IPA|/ə/}} is phonetically open-mid somewhat retracted central {{IPAblink|ɜ|ɜ̠}}, rather than mid central.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sarlin|2014|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Less frequent vowels===

====ö====
In addition to the seven core vowels, in a number of words of foreign origin (predominantly French, but also German) the [[mid front rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ø/}} (rounded Romanian {{IPA|/e/}}; example word: ''bleu'' {{IPA|/blø/}} 'light blue') and the [[mid central rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɵ/}} (rounded Romanian {{IPA|/ə/}}; example word: ''chemin de fer'' {{IPA|/ʃɵˌmen dɵ ˈfer/}} '[[Baccarat (card game)#Chemin de Fer|Chemin de Fer]]') have been preserved, without replacing them with any of the existing phonemes.&lt;ref&gt;Academia Română, ''Dicționarul ortografic, ortoepic și morfologic al limbii române'', Ediția a II-a revăzută și adăugită, Editura Univers Enciclopedic, București, 2005 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The borrowed words have become part of the Romanian vocabulary and follow the usual inflexion rules, so that the new vowels, though less common, could be considered as part of the Romanian phoneme set. Romanian dictionaries use {{angbr|ö}} in their phonetic descriptions to represent both vowels, which suggests that they may be actually pronounced identically by Romanian speakers. {{OR|date=September 2018}}

Because they are not native phonemes, their pronunciation may fluctuate or they may even be replaced by the diphthong {{IPA|/e̯o/}}. In older French borrowings it has often been replaced by {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, or {{IPA|/e̯o/}}, as in ''șofer'' {{IPA|/ʃoˈfer/}} ('driver', from French ''chauffeur''), ''masor'' {{IPA|/maˈsor/}} ('masseur', from ''masseur''), and ''sufleor'' {{IPA|/suˈfle̯or/}} ('theater prompter', from ''souffleur'').

====ü====
Similarly, borrowings from languages such as [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] sometimes contain the [[close front rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/y/}}: ''ecru'' {{IPA|/eˈkry/}}, ''tul'' {{IPA|/tyl/}}, ''führer'' {{IPA|/ˈfyrer/, /ˈfyrər/}}. The symbol used for it in phonetic notations in Romanian dictionaries is {{angbr|ü}}. Educated speakers usually pronounce it {{IPA|/y/}}, but other realizations such as {{IPA|/ju/}} also occur. Older words that originally had this sound have had it replaced with {{IPA|/ju/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, or {{IPA|/i/}}. For instance, [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''kül'' became ''ghiul'' {{IPA|/ɡjul/}} ('large ring'), Turkish ''tütün'' became ''tutun'' {{IPA|/tuˈtun/}} ('tobacco'), but ''tiutiun'' {{IPA|[tjuˈtjun]}} in the [[Moldavian subdialect of Romanian|Moldavian subdialect]], [[German language|German]] ''Düse'' gave ''duză'' {{IPA|/ˈduzə/}} ('nozzle') and [[French language|French]] ''bureau'' became ''birou'' {{IPA|/biˈrow/}} ('desk', 'office').

=== Diphthongs and triphthongs===
According to Ioana Chițoran, Romanian has two [[diphthongs]]: {{IPA|/e̯a/}} and {{IPA|/o̯a/}}.  As a result of their origin (diphthongization of mid vowels under stress), they appear normally in stressed syllables&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002a|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and make [[#Vowel alternations|morphological alternations]] with the mid vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.

In addition to these, the semivowels {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} can be combined (either before, after, or both) with most vowels. One view considers that only {{IPA|/e̯a/}} and {{IPA|/o̯a/}} can follow an obstruent-liquid cluster such as in ''broască'' ('frog') and ''dreagă'' ('to mend')&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002b|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; and form real [[diphthong]]s, whereas the rest are merely vowel–glide sequences.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2001|pp=8–9}} for one overview regarding Romanian semivowels&lt;/ref&gt;
The traditional view (taught in schools) considers all of the above as diphthongs.

As can be seen from the examples above, the diphthongs {{IPA|/e̯a/}} and {{IPA|/o̯a/}} contrast with {{IPA|/ja/}} and {{IPA|/wa/}} respectively, though there are no [[minimal pair]]s to contrast {{IPA|/o̯a/}} and {{IPA|/wa/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002a|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressionistically, the two pairs sound very similar to native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002a|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because {{IPA|/o̯a/}} doesn't appear in the final syllable of a prosodic word, there are no monosyllabic words with {{IPA|/o̯a/}}; exceptions might include ''voal'' ('veil') and ''doar'' ('only, just'), though Ioana Chițoran argues&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002b|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; that these are best treated as containing glide-vowel sequences rather than diphthongs. In some regional pronunciations, the diphthong {{IPA|/o̯a/}} tends to be pronounced as a single vowel {{IPA|/ɒ/}}.{{sfnp|Pop|1938|p=29}}

Other triphthongs such as {{IPA|/juj/}} and {{IPA|/o̯aw/}} occur sporadically in interjections and uncommon words.

==== Diphthongs in borrowings ====
Borrowings from [[English language|English]] have enlarged the set of ascending diphthongs to also include {{IPA|/jə/}}, {{IPA|/we/}}, {{IPA|/wi/}}, and {{IPA|/wo/}}, or have extended their previously limited use. Generally, these borrowings have retained their original spellings, but their pronunciation has been adapted to Romanian phonology. The table below gives some examples.

{| class="wikitable"
! Diphthong || Examples
|-
| {{IPA|/jə/}}
| ''yearling'' {{IPA|/ˈjərlinɡ/}} 'one-year-old animal (colt)'
|-
| {{IPA|/we/}}
| ''western'' {{IPA|/ˈwestern/}} 'Western (movie set in the American West)'
|-
| {{IPA|/wi/}}
| ''tweeter'' {{IPA|/ˈtwitər/}} 'high-pitch loudspeaker'
|-
| {{IPA|/wo/}}
| ''walkman'' {{IPA|/ˈwokmen/}} 'pocket-sized tape/CD player'
|}

Borrowings such as ''whisky'' and ''week-end'' are listed in some dictionaries as starting with the ascending diphthong {{IPA|/wi/}}, which corresponds to the original English pronunciation, but in others they appear with the descending diphthong {{IPA|/uj/}}.&lt;ref&gt;The entries for [http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=weekend ''week-end''] in several dictionaries specify the pronunciation {{IPA|/ˈujkend/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowel alternations===
Romanian has vowel [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] or [[apophony]] triggered by [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. A stressed syllable has a low vowel, or a diphthong ending in a low vowel, and an unstressed syllable has a mid vowel. Thus {{IPA|/e̯a/}} alternates with {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/o̯a/}} with {{IPA|/o/}}, and {{IPA|/a/}} with {{IPA|/ə/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002b|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This alternation developed from [[History of Romanian#Breaking of e and o|Romanian vowel breaking (diphthongization)]] and [[History of Romanian#Vowel reduction|reduction (weakening)]]. The [[Eastern Romance languages|Eastern Romance]] mid vowels {{IPA|/e o/}} were [[vowel breaking|broken]] in stressed syllables, giving the Romanian diphthongs {{IPA|/e̯a o̯a/}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002b|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the low vowel {{IPA|/a/}} was [[vowel reduction|reduced]] in unstressed syllables, giving the Romanian central vowel {{IPA|/ə/}}.

These sound changes created the stress-triggered vowel alternations in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002b|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here stressed syllables are marked with underlining (''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;''):

This has since been [[grammaticalization|morphologized]] and now shows up in verb conjugations&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002b|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nominal inflection: ''oaste'' — ''oști'', 'army' — 'armies'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002b|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consonants ==
Standard Romanian has twenty phonemic consonants, as listed in the table below. Where symbols for consonants occur in pairs, the left represents a [[voiceless consonant]] and the right represents a [[voiced consonant]].

{{note|1a|1}} All consonants marked as "dental" in this table (excluding {{IPA|/l/}}) are apico-dental.&lt;ref name="draghici"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ovidiu Drăghici|title=Limba Română contemporană. Fonetică. Fonologie. Ortografie. Lexicologie|url=http://cis01.central.ucv.ro/litere/idd/cursuri/an_1/limba_rom_cont/lrc_an1_draghici.pdf|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/l/}} is apico-alveolar.&lt;ref name="draghici"/&gt;

Besides the consonants in this table, a few consonants can have [[allophone]]s:
* Palatalized consonants occur when preceding an underlying word-final {{IPA|/i/}}, which is then deleted.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt_Chițoran_2001_p10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Petrovici|1956}} argues that the palatalized consonants are underlying, but this analysis is not widely accepted.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/n/}} becomes the velar {{IPA|[ŋ]}} before {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/h/}};
* {{IPA|/h/}} becomes the velar {{IPA|[x]}} in word-final positions (''duh'' 'spirit') and before consonants (''hrean'' 'horseradish'); it becomes the palatal {{IPA|[ç]}} before {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[j]}}, like in the word ''human'' in English, and as a realization for an underlying {{IPA|/hi/}} sequence in word-final positions (''cehi'' 'Czech people' is pronounced {{IPA|[t͡ʃeç]}}, though usually transcribed {{IPA|[t͡ʃehʲ]}}).

The consonant inventory of Romanian is almost the same as [[Italian language|Italian]]. Romanian, however, lacks the palatal consonants {{IPA|/ɲ ʎ/}}, which merged with {{IPA|/j/}} by [[History of Romanian#Lenition of resonants|lenition]], and the affricate {{IPA|/d͡z/}} changed to {{IPA|/z/}} by [[History of Romanian#Spirantization|spirantization]]. Romanian has the fricative {{IPA|/ʒ/}} and the glottal fricative {{IPA|/h/}}, which do not occur in Italian.

===Palatalized consonants===
Palatalized consonants appear mainly at the end of words,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schane|1971|p=505}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mark two grammatical categories: plural nouns and adjectives, and second person singular verbs.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2001|p=11"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interpretation commonly taken is that an underlying morpheme {{IPA|/i/}} palatalizes the consonant and is subsequently deleted.  However, {{IPA|/sʲ/}}, {{IPA|/tʲ/}}, and {{IPA|/dʲ/}} become {{IPA|[ʃʲ]}}, {{IPA|[t͡sʲ]}}, and {{IPA|[zʲ]}}, respectively,&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2001|p=11"/&gt; with very few phonetically justified exceptions, included in the table below, which shows that this palatalization can occur for all consonants.

|-
| – ||
|
| {{IPA|/rʲ/}} || sari {{IPA|/sarʲ/}} 'you jump'
|}

In certain morphological processes {{IPA|/ʲ/}} is replaced by the full vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, for example
* in noun plural genitive formation: ''școli — școlilor'' {{IPA|/ʃkolʲ/ — /ˈʃkolilor/}} ('schools — of the schools'),
* when appending the definite article to some plural nouns: ''brazi — brazii'' {{IPA|/brazʲ/ — /ˈbra.zij/}} ('fir trees — the fir trees')
* in verb + pronoun combinations: ''dați — dați-ne'' {{IPA|/dat͡sʲ/ — /ˈdat͡sine/}} ('give — give us').

This may explain why {{IPA|/ʲ/}} is perceived as a separate sound by native speakers and written with the same letter as the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}.

The non-syllabic {{IPA|/ʲ/}} can be sometimes found inside compound words like ''câțiva'' {{IPA|/kɨt͡sʲˈva/}} ('a few') and ''oriunde'' {{IPA|/orʲˈunde/}} ('wherever'), where the first morpheme happened to end in this {{IPA|/ʲ/}}. A word that contains this twice is ''cincizeci'' {{IPA|/t͡ʃint͡ʃʲˈzet͡ʃʲ/}} ('fifty').

In old Romanian and still in some local pronunciations there is another example of such a non-syllabic, non-semivocalic phoneme, derived from {{IPA|/u/}}, which manifests itself as [[labialization]] of the preceding sound. The usual IPA notation is {{IPA|/ʷ/}}. It is found at the end of some words after consonants and semivowels, as in ''un urs'', pronounced {{IPA|/un ˈursʷ/}} ('a bear'), or ''îmi spui'' {{IPA|/ɨmʲ spujʷ/}} ('you tell me'). The disappearance of this phoneme might be attributed to the fact that, unlike {{IPA|/ʲ/}}, it didn't play any morphological role. It is possibly a trace of Latin endings containing {{IPA|/u/}} (''-us'', ''-um''), this phoneme is related to vowel {{IPA|/u/}} used to connect the definite article "l" to the stem of a noun or adjective, as in ''domn — domnul'' {{IPA|/domn/ — /ˈdomnul/}} ('lord — the lord', cf. [[Latin]] ''dominus'').

=== Other consonants ===
{{original research|date=July 2012}}
As with other languages, Romanian interjections often use sounds beyond the normal phoneme inventory or disobey the normal phonotactical rules, by containing unusual phoneme sequences, by allowing words to be made up of only consonants, or by consisting of repetitions. Such exceptional mechanisms are needed to obtain an increased level of expressivity.&lt;ref name="Academia Română 2005, p. 659"&gt;{{ro icon}} Academia Română, ''Gramatica limbii române'', Editura Academiei Române, București, 2005, Vol. I "Cuvântul", p. 659&lt;/ref&gt; Often, these interjections have multiple spellings or occasionally none at all, which accounts for the difficulty of finding the right approximation using existing letters.&lt;ref name="Academia Română 2005, p. 660"&gt;{{ro icon}} Academia Română, ''Gramatica limbii române'', Editura Academiei Române, București, 2005, Vol. I "Cuvântul", p. 660&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a list of examples.

* A [[Bilabial clicks|bilabial click]] {{IPA|[ʘ]}}, pronounced by rounding the lips and strongly sucking air between them, is used for urging horses to start walking.&lt;ref name="Academia Română 2005, p. 659"/&gt;
* Whistling is another interjection surpassing the limits of the phoneme inventory. It is usually spelled ''fiu-fiu''.&lt;ref name="Academia Română 2005, p. 659"/&gt;
* The [[dental click]] {{IPA|[ǀ]}} (see also [[click consonant]]s) is used in an interjection similar to the English ''tut-tut'' (or ''tsk-tsk''), expressing concern, disappointment, disapproval, etc., and generally accompanied by frowning or a comparable facial expression. Usually two to four such clicks in a row make up the interjection; only one click is rare and more than four can be used for over-emphasis. The Romanian spelling is usually ''tț'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://dexonline.ro/definitie/t%C8%9B Dictionary entries for ''tț'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''ttt'' or ''țțț''.
* The same dental click is used in another interjection, the informal equivalent of "no" ([[wikt:nu#Romanian|''nu'']] in Romanian). Only one click is emitted, usually as an answer to a [[yes-no question]]. Although there is rarely any accompanying sound, the usual spelling is ''nt'' or ''nț''.
* A series of interjections are pronounced with the mouth shut. Depending on intonation, length, and rhythm, they can have various meanings, such as: perplexity, doubt, displeasure, tastiness, toothache, approval, etc.&lt;ref name="Academia Română 2005, p. 660"/&gt; Possible spellings include: ''hm'', ''hâm/hîm'', ''mhm'', ''îhî'', ''mmm'', ''îî'', ''hî''. Phonetically similar, but semantically different, is the English interjection ''ahem''.
* Another interjection, meaning "no", is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈʔḿ ʔm̀]}} ({{IPA|[ˈʔa ʔa]}} with the mouth shut and a high-low phonetic pitch). Possible spellings include: ''î-î'', ''îm-îm'', and ''m-m''. The stress pattern is opposite to the interjection for "yes" mentioned before, pronounced {{IPA|[m̀ˈḿ̥m]}} ({{IPA|[aˈha]}} with the mouth shut and a low-high phonetic pitch).
* ''Pfu'' expresses contempt or dissatisfaction and starts with the [[voiceless bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|/ɸ/}}, sounding like (but being different from) the English ''whew'', which expresses relief after an effort or danger.
* ''Câh/cîh'' expresses disgust and ends in the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}}, similar in meaning to English ''ugh''.
* ''Brrr'' expresses shivering cold and is made up of a single consonant, the [[bilabial trill]], whose [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol is {{IPA|/ʙ/}}

== Stress ==
Romanian has a [[Stress (linguistics)|stress accent]], like almost all other [[Romance languages]] (with the notable exception of [[French language|French]]). Generally, stress falls on the rightmost syllable of a prosodic word (that is, the root and derivational material but excluding inflections and final inflectional vowels).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002b|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a lexically marked stress pattern with penultimate stress exists, any morphologically derived forms will continue to follow the unmarked pattern.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

: ''fráte'' {{IPA|/ˈfrate/}} ('brother'), ''copíl'' {{IPA|/koˈpil/}} ('child')

: ''strúgure'' {{IPA|/ˈstruɡure/}} ('grape'), ''albástru'' {{IPA|/alˈbastru/}} ('blue'), ''călătór'' {{IPA|/kələˈtor/}} ('voyager').

Stress is not normally marked in writing, except occasionally to distinguish between homographs, or in dictionaries for the entry words. When it is marked, the main vowel of the stressed syllable receives an accent (usually [[Acute accent|acute]], but sometimes [[Grave accent|grave]]), for example ''véselă — vesélă'' ('jovial', fem. sg. — 'tableware').

In verb conjugation, noun declension, and other word formation processes, stress shifts can occur. Verbs can have homographic forms only distinguished by stress, such as in ''el suflă'' which can mean 'he blows' (''el súflă'') or 'he blew' (''el suflắ'') depending on whether the stress is on the first or the second syllable, respectively. Changing the grammatical category of a word can lead to similar word pairs, such as the verb ''a albí'' {{IPA|/alˈbi/}} ('to whiten') compared to the adjective ''álbi'' {{IPA|/ˈalbʲ/}} ('white', masc. pl.). Stress in Romanian verbs can normally be predicted by comparing tenses with similar verbs in Spanish, which does indicate stress in writing.

[[Secondary stress]] occurs according to a predictable pattern, falling on every other syllable, starting with the first, as long as it does not fall adjacent to the primary stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosody==

=== Rhythm ===
Languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are called [[stress timing|stress-timed]], meaning that [[syllable]]s are pronounced at a lower or higher rate so as to achieve a roughly equal time interval between [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllables. Another category of languages are [[syllable timing|syllable-timed]], which means that each syllable takes about the same amount of time, regardless of the position of the stresses in the sentence. Romanian is one of the syllable-timed languages, along with other Romance languages ([[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], etc.), [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], and many others. (A third timing system is [[mora timing]], exemplified by [[Classical Latin]], [[Fijian language|Fijian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Old English]].)

The distinction between these timing categories may sometimes seem unclear, and definitions vary. In addition, the time intervals between stresses/syllables/morae are in reality only approximately equal, with many exceptions and large deviations having been reported. However, whereas the actual time may be only approximately equal, the differences are perceptually identical.

In the case of Romanian, consonant clusters are often found both in the syllable [[Syllable onset|onset]] and [[Syllable coda|coda]], which require physical time to be pronounced. The syllable timing rule is then overridden by slowing down the rhythm. Thus, it is seen that stress and syllable timing interact. The sample sentences below, each consisting of six syllables, are illustrative:

: ''Mama pune masa'' &amp;ndash; Mom sets the table

: ''Mulți puști blonzi plâng prin curți'' &amp;ndash; Many blond kids cry in the courtyards

The total time length taken by each of these sentences is obviously different, and attempting to pronounce one of them with the same rhythm as the other results in unnatural utterances.

To a lesser extent, but still perceivably, the syllables are extended in time also on one hand by the presence of liquid and nasal consonants, and on the other by that of semivowels in diphthongs and triphthongs, such as shown in the examples below.

{| class="wikitable"
! Romanian || English
|-
| pic — plic || ''bit'' — ''envelope''
|-
| cec — cerc || ''cheque'' — ''circle''
|-
| zic — zinc || ''I say'' — ''zinc''
|-
| car — chiar || ''I carry'' — ''even''
|-
| sare — soare || ''salt'' — ''sun''
|-
| sta — stea || ''to stay'' — ''star''
|-
| fi — fii || ''be (inf.)'' — ''be (imperative)''
|}

A simple way to evaluate the length of a word, and compare it to another, consists in pronouncing it repeatedly at a natural speech rate.

=== Intonation ===
A detailed description of the [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] patterns must consider a wide range of elements, such as the focus of the sentence, the theme and the rheme, emotional aspects, etc. In this section only a few general traits of the Romanian intonation are discussed. Most importantly, intonation is essential in [[question]]s, especially because, unlike English and other languages, Romanian does not distinguish grammatically declarative and interrogative sentences.

In '''non-emphatic yes/no questions''' the pitch rises at the end of the sentence until the last stressed syllable. If unstressed syllables follow, they often have a falling intonation, but this is not a rule.

: — Ai stins lumina? [ai stins lu↗mi↘na] (''Have you turned off the light?'')

: — Da. (''Yes.'')

In Transylvanian speech these yes/no questions have a very different intonation pattern, usually with a pitch peak at the beginning of the question: [ai ↗stins lumi↘na]

In '''selection questions''' the tone rises at the first element of the selection, and falls at the second.

: — Vrei bere sau vin? [vrei ↗bere sau ↘vin] (''Do you want beer or wine?'')

: — Bere. (''Beer.'')

'''Wh-questions''' start with a high pitch on the first word and then the pitch falls gradually toward the end of the sentence.

: — Cine a lăsat ușa deschisă? [↗cine↘ a lăsat ușa deschisă] (''Who left the door open?'')

: — Mama. (''Mom did.'')

'''Repeat questions''' have a rising intonation.

: — A sunat Rodica adineauri. (''Rodica just called.'')

: — Cine a sunat? [cine a su↗nat] (''Who called?'')

: — Colega ta, Rodica. (''Your classmate, Rodica.'')

'''Tag questions''' are uttered with a rising intonation.

: — Ți-e foame, nu-i așa? [ți-e foame, nu-i a↗șa] (''You're hungry, aren't you?'')

'''Unfinished utterances''' have a rising intonation similar to that of yes/no questions, but the pitch rise is smaller.

: — După ce m-am întors... [după ce m-am în↗tors...] (''After I came back...'')

Various other intonation patterns are used to express: requests, commands, surprise, suggestion, advice, and so on.

In 1969, Nutters of Savile Row modernised the style and approach of the traditional tailors; a modernisation which continued in the 1990s with the arrival of designers including [[Richard James (tailor)|Richard James]], [[Ozwald Boateng]] and [[Timothy Everest]].

==History ==

Tailoring has been associated with Savile Row since the 19th century, when [[Beau Brummell]], who epitomised the well-dressed man, patronised the tailors congregated on the Burlington Estate, notably around [[Cork Street]]. By 1803 some were occupying premises in Savile Row, but none of those original tailors survive today.

The Savile Row Bespoke Association was founded in 2004 to protect and to develop bespoke tailoring as practised in Savile Row and the surrounding streets.&lt;ref name=SRBA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savilerowbespoke.com/about-us/objectives/ |title=Objectives |publisher=Savile Row Bespoke Association |accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founder members include: Anderson &amp; Sheppard, [[Dege &amp; Skinner]], Gieves &amp; Hawkes and Henry Poole. The member tailors are required to put at least 50 hours of hand labour into each two-piece suit.&lt;ref name=SR_MemReq&gt;{{cite web| title=Membership Requirements| url=http://www.savilerowbespoke.com/about-us/membership-requirements| publisher=Savile Row Bespoke Association| date=2014| accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2006 report by the [[City of Westminster]] (Department of Planning and City Development), "Bespoke Tailoring in London’s West End", it was estimated that between 6,000 and 7,000 [[men's suit]]s were made in and around the Savile Row area annually.&lt;ref name=SRT_Westminster_Plan/&gt; This represented a turnover of approximately £21 million.&lt;ref name=SRT_Westminster_Plan/&gt; A [[Reuters]] article in February 2013 suggested that the total revenue for the informal group of suitmakers was now estimated to be £30-35 million pounds, with several tailoring houses having over 10% growth in recent years.&lt;ref name=A&amp;S_Reuters&gt;{{cite web| title=Timeless suits from London's Savile Row back in fashion| author=Stephen Eisenhammer| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/uk-fashion-menswear-savilerow-idUKBRE91J0IY20130220| publisher=Reuters| date=20 February 2013| accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fashion Industry's contribution as a whole to the British economy is an estimated £26 billion a year.&lt;ref name=BBC_FB&gt;{{ cite web| title=The Fashion Business| author=Linda Yueh| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26257403?filter=none| publisher=BBC| date=19 February 2014| accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article| Henry Poole &amp; Co}}
*Henry Poole &amp; Co are the acknowledged "Founders of Savile Row" and creators of the [[Tuxedo]]. The company has remained a family-run business since their establishment in 1806. They opened first in [[Brunswick Square]], in 1806, originally specialising in military tailoring, with particular merit at the time of the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. Their business moved to Savile Row in 1846, following the death of founder James Poole. In 1982, MD Angus Cundey brought the firm back to Savile Row (No. 15), after being in exile on Cork Street since 1961; Poole were forced to move to Cork Street, because the lease at number 32 expired and the unlisted building was demolished.

{{main article| Gieves &amp; Hawkes}}
*Gieves &amp; Hawkes is a traditional British gentleman's bespoke tailor located at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Savile Row. The business dates from the late 19th century, and was formed by the merger of two separate businesses, 'Gieves' (founded 1785)  and 'Hawkes' (founded 1771).&lt;ref name=G&amp;H_EL&gt;{{cite web| title=Gieves and Hawkes at Number One Savile Row in London| url=http://www.elegant-lifestyle.com/gieves-and-hawkes.htm| publisher=Elegant Lifestyle (British Airways)| accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting out with roots from two suppliers who focused on the [[British Army]] and the [[Royal Navy]], it was the first Savile Row tailor to provide [[ready-to-wear]] clothes. There are various Gieves &amp; Hawkes shops and concessions around the UK and in several other countries. It holds a number of [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal warrant of appointment]]s, which cover all three British Royal Warrants ([[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], and HRH [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]).&lt;ref name=G&amp;H_WS&gt;{{cite web| title=Gieves &amp; Hawkes| url=http://www.gievesandhawkes.com| publisher=Gieves &amp; Hawkes| accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Chester Barrie]] was established in 1935 by expatriate English tailor Simon Ackerman, who wanted a British brand and tailoring for his New York-based clothing business. Locating its factory in [[Crewe]] from 1939, close to the [[Port of Liverpool]] and its cloth supplier in [[Huddersfield]], it introduced semi-bespoke and [[ready-to-wear]] tailoring to the row. Sold to [[Austin Reed (retailer)|Austin Reed]] in 1980, it went into receivership in 2002, which split the factory from the retail operation. Now owned by Prominent Europe, clients have included [[Cary Grant]] and [[Winston Churchill]], while both [[Steve McQueen]] and [[Sean Connery]] wore Chester Barrie in their films.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}
*The British fashion house [[Hardy Amies (fashion house)|Hardy Amies]] was founded by English [[dressmaker]] [[Hardy Amies]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="FashEncyc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/A-Az/Amies-Sir-Hardy.html|title=Hardy Amies|publisher=Fashion Encyclopedia|accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been managing designer for [[Lachasse]] in 1934, and having designed clothes for the British Board of Trade under the government Utility Scheme, Amies bought the bombed out shell of No.14 Savile Row in 1946.

Amies was one of the first European designers to venture into the ready-to-wear market when he teamed up with [[Joseph Hepworth (tailor)|Hepworths]] in 1959 to design a range of menswear. In 1961, he made fashion history by staging the first men's ready-to-wear catwalk shows, at the Ritz Hotel in London&lt;ref name="VicAlb"&gt;{{cite web| title=Fashion in Motion: Hardy Amies| url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/f/fashion-in-motion-hardy-amies| publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]| date=April 2006| accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amies also undertook design for in-house work wear, which developed from designing special clothes for groups such as the [[Oxford University Boat Club]] and [[London Stock Exchange]]. Amies also designed costumes for films, including ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name=Amies_IMDB&gt;{{cite web| title=Hardy Amies| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0024868| publisher=[[IMDb]]| accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amies is perhaps best known to the British public for his work for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The association began in 1950, when Amies made several outfits for the then Princess Elizabeth's royal tour to Canada. Although the couture side of the Hardy Amies business was traditionally less financially successful, the award of a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal warrant of appointment]] as official dressmaker in 1955 gave his house a degree of respectability and resultant publicity. One of his best known creations is the gown he designed in 1977 for Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee portrait which, he said, was "immortalised on a thousand biscuit tins."&lt;ref name="FashEncyc"/&gt; Knighted in 1989, Amies held the warrant until 1990, when he gave it up so that younger designers could create for the Queen.

In May 1973, Amies sold the business to [[Debenhams]], who had themselves purchased Hepworths which distributed the Hardy Amies line. Amies purchased the business back in 1981. In May 2001, Amies sold his business to the Luxury Brands Group. He retired at the end of that year, when [[Morocco|Moroccan]]-born designer Jacques Azagury became head of couture. In November 2008, after going [[bankruptcy]], the Hardy Amies brand was acquired by Fung Capital, the private investment arm of Victor and William Fung, who together control the Li &amp; Fung group.&lt;ref name=HA_Fung&gt;{{cite web| title=Hardy Amies UK stores to close following sale to Fung Capital| author=Lisa Berwin| url=http://www.retail-week.com/hardy-amies-uk-stores-to-close-following-sale-to-fung-capital/1920101.article| publisher=Retail Week| date=11 November 2008| accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current collection is overseen by design director Mehmet Ali. The Hardy Amies name is still licensed globally, particularly in Japan.

===Conduit Street tailors===
*Established by Austrian tailor Jonathan Meyer at 36 Conduit Street in the late 18th century, Meyer &amp; Mortimer supplied both the [[Prince regent]] and his fashion mentor, Beau Brummell, as early as 1800. When the Prince became [[George IV of the United Kingdom]] he awarded the company a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal warrant of appointment]] which, through [[Queen Victoria]] and monarchs since, it still holds today. After Meyer pioneered modern trouser design in the 19th century, he formed a new company with Mortimer in Edinburgh, called the Royal Clan Tartan Warehouse.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} After being bombed out of its premises during World War 2, the company relocated to its current location at 6 Sackville Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.meyerandmortimer.co.uk|title=Meyer &amp; Mortimer| publisher=Meyer &amp; Mortimer| accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
As of November 2014, there are only two family-owned tailoring houses left on Savile Row, namely Dege &amp; Skinner and Henry Poole &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=KarlWest&gt;{{cite web| title=Savile Row tailor fears overseas threat to rich tapestry of tradition| author=Karl West| url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/nov/14/savile-row-tailoring-foreign-buyout-threat-hong-kong| publisher=The Guardian| date=14 November 2014| accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managing Director of D&amp;S William G. Skinner, when interviewed by The Business of Fashion (BofF) website, stated: "Ready-to-wear has been available on the Row for some time, but recession and a tough economic climate have led some retailers further down the road of ready-to-wear..."&lt;ref name=BofFPt2&gt;{{cite web| title=A Row of Opportunity, Part 2| author=Robin Mellery-Pratt| url=http://www.businessoffashion.com/2014/01/row-opportunity-part-2.html| publisher=The Business of Fashion| date=29 January 2014| accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in recent years the global luxury menswear market has grown at roughly double the pace of luxury womenswear, the tailors of Savile Row face the stark reality that bespoke tailoring is simply not a scalable business.&lt;ref name=BofFPt1&gt;{{cite web| title=A Row of Opportunity, Part 1| author=Robin Mellery-Pratt| url=http://www.businessoffashion.com/2014/01/row-opportunity-part-1.html| publisher=The Business of Fashion| date=28 January 2014| accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How different companies compete in the forthcoming years will vary. Starting with the 150-year-old company Dege &amp; Skinner, William Skinner points out the young people involved: the future generation of tailors, serving apprenticeships within the trade.&lt;ref name=KarlWest/&gt; He stated in an interview to [[The Guardian]]: "That highlights our belief in the future of the bespoke tailoring business. We have invested in the future of the trade, because we are confident about the future of the trade. We have a good business model; we make money and we reinvest it in the company. We are not a museum piece by any means."&lt;ref name=KarlWest/&gt; He continued: "A lot of people don’t want to go into a high street shop, they want the relationship and the service that we give. As long as we can maintain that, there’s every chance of surviving."&lt;ref name=KarlWest/&gt;

At Gieves &amp; Hawkes (G&amp;H), founded in 1771, the approach differs. In 2012, G&amp;H was bought up by Trinity Ltd., part of Hong Kong's Fung Capital, the private equity partnership of Victor and William Fung, the chairman and group managing director of Li &amp; Fung, the world’s largest supplier to consumer brands of clothing.&lt;ref name=BofFPt1/&gt; Ray Clacher, Chief Executive of G&amp;H, stated in an interview to The BofF: "In the last 12 months, we have [become] a more style-driven, less suit-dependent company than we have been in the past... We have hired in excess of 40 new heads just to look after design, production and development and merchandising."&lt;ref name=BofFPt1/&gt; He continued: "We have opened seventeen stores and we have certainly spent over £10 million in terms of pure hardware — going into digital, websites for Japan, China, the UK."&lt;ref name=BofFPt1/&gt;

Patrick Grant, designer and owner since 2005 of bespoke tailor Norton &amp; Sons and its sister ready-to-wear line E. Tautz, stated to The BofF : "The simple truth is that there are opportunities to sell ready-to-wear clothes thanks to Savile Row’s history."&lt;ref name=BofFPt1/&gt; He continued: "Personally as someone who has a business on both sides, I would like to see anything with a Savile Row name on it actually made on Savile Row... If you have got ten thousand suits being made by hand on Savile Row, but you have got a million suits somewhere in a factory in Asia also called Savile Row, I don’t think it can do anything other than hurt the business here."&lt;ref name=BofFPt2/&gt;

Kilgour &amp; French was taken over by the company '14 Savile Row', a subsidiary of Fung Capital, in 2013.&lt;ref name=TG_Brandelli&gt;{{ cite web| title=The Savile Row saviour| author=Nick Compton| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/mens-style/45665/the-savile-row-saviour.html| publisher=The Daily Telegraph| date=21 September 2014| accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 14 Savile Row also owns Hardy Amies and Norman Hartnell. They managed to re-install Carlo Brandelli as Creative Director, who had resigned when Kilgour was taken over by in 2008 by [[JMH Group|JMH Lifestyle]].&lt;ref name=TG_Brandelli/&gt; According to Brandelli, Savile Row has been invigorated, but he stated to [[The Daily Telegraph]]: "It has changed over the last few years but it is still not enough." He continued: "Too many of the tailors are like the wrong kind of museum."&lt;ref name=TG_Brandelli/&gt;

Huntsman's Roubi L’Roubi is adamant that ready-to-wear is crucial to the survival of the Row.&lt;ref name=SR_Economia&gt;{{cite web| title=Savile Row Uncut| author=Laura Powell| url=http://economia.icaew.com/life/september-2014/savile-row-uncut| publisher=economia| date=5 September 2014| accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated to the website Economia: "There’s a way of carrying the traditions and modernising. They are not mutually exclusive."&lt;ref name=SR_Economia/&gt; He also broaches the subject of the dwindling proportion of female customers: today it accounts for less than 5% at Poole, Huntsman and Gieves &amp; Hawkes.&lt;ref name=SR_Economia/&gt; He states: "It’s because women want instant purchases. They want to buy it, take it home and wear it that evening."&lt;ref name=SR_Economia/&gt; At present, the companies that advertise as bespoke tailors for women include: Nooshin, Katherine  Maylin, King &amp; Allen and Kathryn Sargent.

Henry Poole &amp; Co. are wanting to expand into China.&lt;ref name=SR_CNBC&gt;{{ cite web| title=China the perfect fit for London’s $6,000 luxe tailors| author=Arjun Kharpal| url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101905712| publisher=CNBC| date=25 August 2014| accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[CNBC]], Simon Cundey, director of Henry Poole &amp; Co, stated: "We've had a number of customers who have ordered in London and want the attention to detail we offer them and we hope that by bringing that option to Beijing we can grow the market there."&lt;ref name=SR_CNBC/&gt; Henry Poole &amp; Co already has two stores in China through a partnership; however tailors make the framework for the suit in London and send it over to be assembled in a Chinese factory.&lt;ref name=SR_CNBC/&gt;

Westminster policy 'CM2.3: Savile Row Special Policy Area' states: "The Savile Row Special Policy Area (SPA) is home to a historic concentration of bespoke tailoring, with the street name in itself acting as a widely recognised international brand, synonymous with the unique and high quality bespoke and discreet, personal service it offers."&lt;ref name=WCP&gt;{{cite web| title=Westminster's City Plan| url=https://www.westminster.gov.uk/westminsters-city-plan-strategic-policies| publisher=The City of Westminster| pages=42-44| date=November 2016| access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also states: "Encouraging bespoke tailoring uses in the Savile Row SPA will continue to support this cluster of bespoke tailoring activities and the wider bespoke tailoring industry in Westminster and the UK."&lt;ref name=WCP/&gt;

'''Spray-on clothing''' is a form of [[clothing]], that is applied by spraying [[polymer]] over the body in such a manner that it appears as clothing. It is a polymer mix that dries relatively quickly.&lt;ref name=DailyMail2010-10-04/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyMail2010-09-30/&gt;&lt;ref name=SciAm2013-10-25&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/spray-on-clothing-could-d/ |title=Spray-On Clothing Could Deliver a Suit in a Can [Video] |publisher=Scientific American |date= |accessdate=2016-11-16 | quote = Someday, packing for a trip might be as simple as stowing a spray can of colloidal polymer mix for making your own spray-on clothes. Whether it’s a T-shirt or evening attire, spray-on fabric is a novel way to make a variety of light-use fabrics. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2010, [[Ian Sample]], ''[[The Guardian (UK)|The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Science correspondent reported on a press conference where Dr Manuel Torres showed a spray-on clothing product named [[Fabrican]].&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2010-09-16/&gt;  Covering the same announcement Prita Ganapati, writing for ''[[Wired magazine]]'' referred to the result as ''"spray-on fabric"''.&lt;ref name=Wired2010-09-16/&gt;  ''The Guardian'' referred to both ''"spray-on bandages"'' and ''"spray-on fabric"''.  ''[[Scientific American]]'' referred to both ''"spray-on clothing"'' and ''"spray-on clothes"''.&lt;ref name=SciAm2013-10-25/&gt; Torres described the fabric as similar to felt.

In a 2010 article published in the [[Daily Mail (UK)|''Daily Mail'']] Laura Stott described being allowed to wear a prototype spray-on shirt, and being pleasantly surprised that it did not tear, or rip, when she hung her large handbag from her shoulder.&lt;ref name=DailyMail2010-10-04/&gt;  She said she was able to take off the shirt as easily as any t-shirt, and that it retained its shape on subsequent wearings.

'''''The Qing Ding Pearl''''' (《慶頂珠》, simplified 庆顶珠) is a Chinese play. It dates to the [[Song Dynasty]] and is still performed in adapted forms in the [[Beijing Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;The Longman anthology of drama and theater: a global perspective   Michael L. Greenwald, Roger Schultz, Roberto Darío Pomo - 2002 -p571 "It is best known as The Qing Ding Pearl (pronounced "chin deen"), a reference to the engagement pearl that Chinese maidens wear on the crown of their bridal headpieces. In this story the pearl takes on magic powers because it allows the ."&lt;/ref&gt;

The play is known by other titles:&lt;ref&gt;They sing theatre: the aural performance of Beijing opera Elizabeth Wichmann University of Hawaii, 1983 p554&lt;/ref&gt; Two sections ([[:wikt:折|折]] zhe) of the main play are sometimes performed separately as '''''The Fisherman's Revenge'''''《漁夫恨》 or '''''A Fisherman Kills a Family''''' (《打漁殺家》, simplified 打渔杀家 dayu sha jia)&lt;ref&gt;寂寞沙洲冷: 周正榮京劇藝術 - p160  王安祈, 李元皓 - 2003 "父與女的堅強與軟弱《打漁殺家》賞析《打漁殺家》是全本《慶頂珠》故事的兩折,又叫《漁夫恨》、《討漁稅》,由於劇本結構的凝鍊、人物語言的鮮活生動、主題意識的色彩強烈,再加上演員的不斷創造,故此這齣戲歷久彌新,在不同的時代環境下都大受歡迎"&lt;/ref&gt; also '''''Collecting the Fishing Tax''''' (《討漁稅》 ''taoyushui'').

==Plot==
The play tells the story of [[Hsiao En]], a poor [[fisherman]] and his daughter who seeks bloody revenge after their livelihoods are taxed away by the overbearing  [[Ting Yuan Wai]]. Ting Yuan Wai sends tax collectors and [[boxers]] to Hsiao’s fishing vessel but the fisherman refuses because the tax is illegal and the river had run dry. There's no fish for him to be taxed on. Two [[swashbucklers]] named Li Chun and [[Ni Jung]] help Hsiao En. The now bloodied Boxers escape and report to Ting Yuan Wai. For his transgression, Hsiao is whipped. Angered, he and his daughter go to Yuan’s residence – The [[Ting Mansion]]. They sneak in, his daughter wearing the [[Qing Ding Pearl]] to masquerade as a noble. Inside, the pair slays everyone inside.

==Music==
The play is a ''[[xipi]]'' (西皮 ''western skins'') play.

==History==
The twentieth-century Chinese actor [[Mei Lanfang]] frequently performed the role of the fisherman's daughter to great acclaim.

The '''Throne Celebration in Morocco''' is a national occasion celebrated on 30 July of each year, punctuated by several official and popular celebrations, it commemorates the day of the King's accession to the throne. The first celebration was held in 1933 to recognise the accession of [[Mohammed V of Morocco]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of Modern Morocco |last=Miller |first=Susan Gilson  |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |isbn= 9781139619110 |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current King [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|Mohammed VI]] succeeded his father on 23 July 1999 and officially took the throne on 30 July.  On the occasion, several nationwide events are covered on public television, including official activities.

== History ==
The first celebration was in 1933 in honour of King [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], and was thereafter held on November 18 each year. The date moved to March 3 during the rule of the late King [[Hassan II]] (1961-1999). When King [[Mohammed VI]] took the throne in 1999, it moved again to July 30.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aglobalworld.com/holidays-around-the-world/morocco-throne-feast/|title=Morocco Festively Celebrates Feast of the Throne|website=aglobalworld.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Throne Speech == 
The '''Throne Speech''' is given on the 30 July, when the King addresses the nation on official State TV, giving an inventory of events and projects completed during the previous year, and discusses the future vision and foreign policies of the kingdom. According to Article 52 of the [[Constitution of Morocco]] of 2011, the King has to address both the nation and parliament in order to make the Throne Speech binding to the nation and to the authorities.
