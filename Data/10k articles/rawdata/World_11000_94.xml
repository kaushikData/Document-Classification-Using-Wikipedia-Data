'''Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://acpss.ahram.org.eg/eng/ |title=ACPSS |access-date=2010-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107130651/http://acpss.ahram.org.eg/eng/ |archive-date=2010-01-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 1968 as an independent research unit functioning within the framework of [[Al-Ahram Foundation]].

The Center has evolved over time, with reforms in 1972 that broadened its research scope beyond [[Zionism]] and [[Demographics of Israel|Israeli society]] to incorporate the international and strategic issues, with a special focus on developmental issues and interactive trends between [[Arab world|Arab countries]] and the international system, the [[Middle East|regional]] framework surrounding them, and [[Arab League|amongst one another]].

The Center devotes a large part of its activities to studying the [[Demographics of Egypt|Egyptian society]] from its various [[Politics of Egypt|political]], economic, [[Egyptian Armed Forces|military]] and [[Culture of Egypt|social]] viewpoints. The center maintains complete independence in directing its research activities, and is keen on adhering to a philosophy of [[Critical thinking|criticism]]; and it aims to advance an intellectual, investigative vision for the issues at hand. It also provides for the [[freedom of speech]] of its scholars and researchers in accordance with the guidelines of [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and scientific research.
The programs of the center are the result of collective efforts built on a framework of democratic scientific research planning.

'''Almannaskarðsgöng''' is a [[tunnel]] along [[Route 1 (Iceland)|Route 1]], located just east of the town of [[Höfn]] (Hornafjörður) in the [[Eastern Region (Iceland)|Eastern Region]] of [[Iceland]]. 

[[File:2008-05-23 20 Skarðsfjörður.jpg|thumb|right|View for the pass]]
The construction of the tunnel began in March 2004, the breakthrough was in October that same year, and the tunnel was opened on June 24, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-from-iceland.com/2005_06.html|title=News from Iceland |publisher=News from Iceland - Review Journal|date=June 2005|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel runs through 1,150 metres of solid rock and some 162 metres of concrete portals, bringing the total length to 1,312 metres (although a sign rounds it off to 1,300 m). The tunnel is two lanes wide, with three passing areas for emergency traffic. The southern tunnel entrance is located at 39 m above sea level whilst the northern tunnel entrance is 82 m high, making the incline of the tunnel 4.6%.

The tunnel replaced the narrow and steep Almannaskarð pass which was regularly closed during the winter because of snow, impeding traffic to and from the east of Iceland. The pass is still accessible in the summertime from the northern ramp and there is a parking place with a beautiful view (the southwest ramp is closed to public traffic).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2815">'''Aluminium in Africa''' originates primarily in [[Guinea]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Ghana]]. Guinea is by far the biggest producer in [[Africa]], and is a world leader in [[aluminium]] and [[bauxite]] production; see "[[Bauxite#World bauxite mine production, reserves, and reserve base|World bauxite mine production, reserves, and reserve base]]" at the bauxite article.

There are many companies involved in the aluminium trade in Africa. Principal [[mining|mine]] and [[smelter]] operators include:

== [[Cameroon]] ==

* [[Ngaoundéré]] - [[Railway stations in Cameroon|railhead]]

== [[Ghana]] ==
* [[Ghana Bauxite]], affiliated with [[Alcan]]
* [[Volta Aluminum Company]] (Valco)

== [[Guinea]] ==
* [[Rio Tinto Alcan]]
* [[Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée]] (CBG) - in the [[Boké Region]] - Guinea's largest producer, affiliated with [[Halco Mining]], which is affiliated with [[Alcan]], [[Alcoa]], [[Reynolds Metals]], [[Pechiney]], [[Comalco]], etc.
* [[Alumina Company of Guinea]], ACG - operating the [[Friguia bauxite-alumina complex]] at [[Fria]] &lt;ref name="railwaysafrica.com"&gt;http://railwaysafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3381&amp;Itemid=35&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Societé des Bauxites de Kindia]] SBK - state-owned, operates the [[Kindia]] mining operations; operated by [[Rusal]] (Russia Aluminium) and exports bauxite to [[Ukraine]]
* [[Global Alumina Products Corporation]], proposed smelting operation in [[Conakry]]
* [[Kinia]] - refinery &lt;ref name="railwaysafrica.com"/&gt;
* [[Sangaredi]]
* There are over 100 Guinean aluminium companies listed at MBendi's Bauxite:Africa:Guinea information page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbendi.co.za/indy/ming/baux/af/gu/p0005.htm Mbendi overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Mozambique]] ==

'''Cheesecake''' is a sweet [[dessert]] consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest layer, consists of a mixture of soft, fresh [[cheese]] (typically [[cream cheese]] or [[ricotta]]), eggs, vanilla and sugar; if there is a bottom layer it often consists of a crust or base made from crushed [[cookies]] (or [[digestive biscuits]]), [[Graham cracker crust|graham crackers]], [[pastry]], or [[sponge cake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fergusonplarre.com.au/History/Cheescakes.html | author = Ferguson Plarre Bakehouses | title = A History of Cheesecakes | publisher = www.fergusonplarre.com.au | accessdate = 2008-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be [[baked]] or unbaked (usually refrigerated). Cheesecake is usually sweetened with [[sugar]] and may be flavored or topped with [[fruit]], [[whipped cream]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], cookies, fruit sauce, or [[chocolate syrup]]. Cheesecake can be prepared in many flavors, such as [[strawberry]], [[pumpkin]], [[key lime]], [[lemon]], [[chocolate]], [[Oreo]], [[chestnut]], or [[toffee]].

== History ==
An ancient form of cheesecake may have been a popular dish in [[ancient Greece]] even prior to Romans' adoption of it with the conquest of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Bovbjerg, Jeremy Iggers, ''The Joy of Cheesecake'', Barron's Educational Series, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attested mention of a cheesecake is by the Greek physician [[Aegimus]] (5th century BCE), who wrote a book on the art of making cheesecakes ({{lang|grc|πλακουντοποιικόν σύγγραμμα}}—''plakountopoiikon sungramma'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Callimachus]], ''ap. Athen'', xiv. p. 643, e&lt;/ref&gt;The earliest extant cheesecake recipes are found in [[Cato the Elder]]'s ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'', which includes [[recipe]]s for three cakes for religious uses: ''libum'', ''savillum'' and ''[[Placenta cake|placenta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cato the Elder, ''De Agri Cultura'', paragraphs 75 and 76.  Available in English on-line at:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/E*.html University of Chicago: Penelope]  (Note:  The "leaves" mentioned in Cato's recipe are bay leaves.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.novaroma.org/religio_romana/cato_recipes.html | author = | title = Cato's 'De Agricultura': Recipes | publisher = www.novaroma.org | accessdate = 2008-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cato/de_agricultura/e*.html | author = | title = Cato's 'De Agricultura': Recipes | publisher =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the three, placenta is most like most modern cheesecakes, having a crust that is separately prepared and baked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.culinaryschools.com/newsletter/July%202007%20CulinarySchools.com%20Newsletter.pdf | title = A Bit of Food History: Cheesecake | publisher = www.culinaryschools.com | accessdate = 2008-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more modern version is found in ''[[Forme of Cury]]'', an English cookbook from 1390.&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1525/gfc.2002.2.4.19| title = Cheesecakes, Junkets, and Syllabubs| journal = Gastronomica| volume = 2| issue = 4| pages = 19| year = 2002| last1 = Wilson | first1 = C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, chef [[Heston Blumenthal]] has argued that cheesecake is an English invention.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heston Blumenthal|title=Historic Heston|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdHYAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-4088-0441-4|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheesecake did not evolve into the dessert that we see today up until somewhere around the 18th century. Europeans began removing yeast and adding beaten eggs to the cheesecake instead. With the overpowering yeast flavor gone, the result tasted more like a [[dessert]] treat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cheesecake.com/History-Of-Cheesecake.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern commercial American cream cheese was developed in 1872, when William Lawrence, from [[Chester, Orange County, New York|Chester, New York]], while looking for a way to recreate the soft, French cheese [[Neufchâtel (cheese)|Neufchâtel]], accidentally came up with a way of making an "unripened cheese" that is heavier and creamier; other dairymen came up with similar creations independently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Cakes/Cheesecake.htm cheesecake History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cheesecake comes in two different types.  Along with the baked cheesecake, some cheesecakes are made with uncooked cream-cheese on a crumbled-biscuit base.  This type of cheesecake was invented in the United States.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;

== Composition ==
The early Greeks considered cheesecake a cake. Some modern authors point to the presence of many eggs, the sole source of leavening, as proof that it is a [[torte]]. Still others claim that the separate crust, the soft filling, and the absence of flour prove that it is a [[custard pie]].&lt;ref&gt;Berenbaum, Rose Levy (1988). ''The Cake Bible''. William Morrow Cookbooks. {{ISBN|978-0-688-04402-2}}. p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

== National varieties ==
Cheesecakes can be broadly categorized into two basic types: [[Baking|baked]] and unbaked. Each comes in a variety of styles determined by region:

=== Africa ===
;South Africa: South Africa has many different varieties of cheesecake. One popular variant is made with whipped cream, cream cheese, gelatine for the filling, and a buttered digestive biscuit crust. It is not baked, and is sometimes made with [[Amarula]] liqueur. This variant is very similar to British cheesecake. This cheesecake is more common in [[British South African|British South African communities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A South African Favourite: Amarula Cheesecake|url=https://www.hotelschool.co.za/2014/08/south-african-favourite-amarula-cheesecake|website=The International Hotel School|publisher=The International Hotel School|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
[[Asian cuisine|Asian-style]] cheesecake flavors include [[matcha]] (powdered Japanese green tea), [[lychee]], and [[mango]]. Asian-style cheesecakes are also lighter in flavor and are sometimes light and spongy in texture. Compared to its counterparts, Asian cheesecake is also considerably less sweet.

; Japan: [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]]-style cheesecake relies upon the [[emulsification]] of [[cornstarch]] and eggs to make a smooth [[flan]]-like texture and almost [[plasticine]] appearance.

; India: The Indian state of [[Odisha]] is known for [[Chhena poda]] which is a type of cheesecake made by baking a mixture of chhena - a type of cottage cheese, sugar and nuts.

=== Australia ===

Australian cheesecakes are more commonly unbaked.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Common flavors include passionfruit, chocolate, raspberry, lemon, caramel, and vanilla.

=== Europe ===
; Bulgaria: [[Bulgarian cuisine|Bulgarian]]-style cheesecake uses [[cream cheese]] in a New York–style filling and [[Smetana (cream)|smetana]] for a top layer. Ground nuts are often added to the crust mixture.
; France: [[French cuisine|French]]-style cheesecakes are very light, feature gelatin as a binding ingredient, and are typically only 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;cm (1 to 2&amp;nbsp;inches) high. This variety gets its light texture and flavor from [[Neufchâtel (cheese)|Neufchâtel cheese]].
; Germany: [[German cuisine|German]]-style cheesecake (''Käsekuchen'', ''Quarkkuchen'', ''Matzkuchen''; ''Topfenkuchen'' in Austria) uses [[Quark (dairy product)|quark]] and a freshly made dough, not Graham crackers. The ''Käsesahnetorte'' (cheese cream [[tart]]) adds cream and is not baked. This recipe is sometimes translated into English using rennet-based [[cottage cheese]], but a German ''Quarkkuchen'' uses quark cheese made from sour milk.
; Greece: In Greece the cheese cake has been made since antiquity and is now traditionally made using [[mizithra]]. There are many regional variants of the ''mizithropita''.
; Italy: [[Ancient Roman cuisine|Ancient Roman]]-style cheesecake uses [[honey]] and a [[ricotta]]-like cheese along with flour and is traditionally shaped into loaves. Some recipes call for [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]], which may have been used as a preservative.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} [[Italian cuisine|Italian]]-style cheesecake uses ricotta or [[mascarpone]] cheese, sugar, [[vanilla]] extract, and sometimes [[barley]] flakes. This type of cheesecake is typically drier than American styles. Small bits of candied fruit are often added.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
; The Netherlands and Belgium: [[Netherlands|Dutch]]/[[Belgium|Belgian]]-style cheesecakes are typically flavored with fruit or melted bittersweet chocolate, are generally made with quark, and are not baked. Belgian cheesecake also includes a ''[[speculaas]]'' crust (''speculaas'' is a traditional Dutch-Belgian biscuit).
; Poland: [[List of Polish cuisine dishes#Dessert|Polish]] ''sernik'' (cheesecake), one of the most popular desserts in Poland, is made primarily using [[twaróg]], Polish quark cheese.
; Portugal: The [[Portuguese Cuisine|Portuguese]] confectionery [[Queijada]] is closely related to cheesecake, although smaller in size and prepared with [[Requeijão]], a typically Portuguese cheese. 
; Russia: [[Russian cuisine|Russian]]-style cheesecake (''Vatrushka'') is in the form of a dough ring and filled with quark or cottage cheese.&lt;ref&gt;https://rbth.com/multimedia/video/2015/11/26/kings-vatrushka-a-rusian-style-cheesecake_544793&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tvorozhnaya zapekanka'' is a crustless baked cheesecake that mixes tvorog (Russian quark), eggs and semolina, and often includes raisins. It is a traditional snack in Russian kindergartens.
; Sweden: [[Swedish cuisine|Swedish]]-style cheesecake differs greatly from other cheesecakes. A Swedish cheesecake is not layered and is traditionally produced by adding [[rennet]] to milk and letting the [[casein]] coagulate. It is then baked in an [[oven]] and served warm. Since the process of curdling milk is somewhat complicated, alternative recipes intended for home cooking instead use cottage cheese as a base to simulate the texture of the dessert. Swedish-style cheesecake is traditionally served with [[jam]] and [[whipped cream]]. There are two different types of Swedish cheesecake from different regions in Sweden. To avoid confusion with other cheesecakes, Swedish cheesecake is usually called [[ostkaka]].
; United Kingdom and Ireland: In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], cheesecake is typically made with a base of crushed, buttered [[biscuits]] and often topped with a fruit [[compote]]. The most common commercial varieties are [[black cherry]], [[blackcurrant]], [[strawberry]], [[passionfruit]], [[raspberry]], and [[lemon curd]]. The usual filling is a mixture of cream cheese, sugar, and cream{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and it is not baked, but refrigerated. Gelatine (sometimes in the form of fruit-flavored dessert [[Gelatin dessert|jelly]]{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}) may also be mixed in with the cheese/cream mixture to keep the filling firm. Variations are common, and include [[banoffee]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], chocolate, [[Irish cream]], [[white chocolate]], and [[marshmallow]] flavors.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Savory [[smoked salmon cheesecake]] is made in Scotland.

=== North America ===
====United States====
The [[United States]] has several different recipes for cheesecake and this usually depends on the region in which the cake was baked, as well as the cultural background of the person baking it.&lt;ref name="mitchell"&gt;{{cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Russ | title = Say Cheesecake! | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/11/18/sunday/main7067769.shtml | accessdate = 17 December 2010 | newspaper = CBS News | date = 21 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cheesecakes are typically baked before serving.

* [[New York City|New York]]–style cheesecake relies upon heavy [[cream]] or [[sour cream]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/towards-a-unified-theory-of-the-new-york-cheesecake|title=Towards A Unified Theory of the New York Cheesecake}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical New York cheesecake is rich and has a dense, smooth, and creamy consistency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joyofbaking.com/Cheesecake.html NY Cheese Cake Recipe &amp; Video – Joyofbaking.com *Video Recipe*&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sour cream makes the cheesecake more resilient to freezing and is the method by which most frozen cheesecakes are made. However, a lavish variant uses sour cream as a topping, applied when the cheesecake is cooked. It is mixed with [[vanilla extract]] and sugar and replaced in the oven, essentially making the cheesecake twice-baked.
* [[Chicago]]–style cheesecake is a baked cream-cheese version which is firm on the outside with a soft and creamy texture on the inside. These cheesecakes are often made in a greased cake pan and are relatively fluffy in texture. The crust used with this style of cheesecake is most commonly made from shortbread which is crushed and mixed with sugar and butter. Some frozen cheesecakes are Chicago-style.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, Andrew (2006). "Different Types of Cheesecake".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''COMPAT.eGov''' is a European LLP research project financed through the [[Lifelong Learning Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;Full info on the LLP: http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-programme/doc78_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Full info on the LdV Programme of the EU: http://ec.europa.eu/education/leonardo-da-vinci/doc1037_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The project consortium is composed of eight partners from four different countries.

The general objective of the COMPAT.eGov project is to improve the efficiency of European [[vocational education and training]] in the governmental sector. The project is based on the supposed need for initiatives which focus on the competence assessment and relevant training frameworks in this sector and others, which has been identified as a priority by the EU.&lt;ref&gt;As per i2010 (http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/eeurope/i2010/index_en.htm)&lt;/ref&gt; The EU has also indicated this through initiatives such as "2010 – A European Information Society for growth and employment".

== Overview of COMPAT.eGov ==

According to information publicized by the project, COMPAT.eGov focuses on aspects such as:&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from the COMPAT.eGov website at: {{cite web |url=http://www.compategov.eu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722161459/http://www.compategov.eu/ |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;COMPAT.eGov at the official ADAM Database of LdV projects: http://www.adam-europe.eu/adam/project/view.htm?prj=6988&amp;projLang=en&lt;/ref&gt;
*enhancing vocational training of public authorities in the incorporation of online services
*identifying alternative ways for governmental agencies and public authorities to serve the citizens efficiently in areas/cases where the deployment of physical services and personnel is costly or not possible.
*establishing an assessment framework that to elaborate on the competence identification of civil servants, in relation to the eGov paradigm
*providing correspondence with the European Qualification Framework, so that the civil servants’ competencies are better understood and the qualifications levels of different countries and different education and training systems can be better compared.

== COMPAT.eGov Main Objectives ==

The COMPAT.eGov project claims to work towards the following objectives:&lt;ref&gt;Taken from the ADAM Database entry on COMPAT.eGov: http://www.adam-europe.eu/adam/project/view.htm?prj=6988&amp;projLang=en&lt;/ref&gt;
# to broaden the analysis of the needs regarding eGov services support that has been done in countries participating in the consortium and examine additional countries with different degrees of eGov services deployment and adoption
# to review the status of existing eGov services in the participating countries
# to provision for alignment between the competence assessment framework to be used within the project and the [[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]]
# to adapt existing training scenarios, content and curriculum, already developed in previous initiatives, promoting the combination of ICT-based learning with traditional forms of learning (such as seminars and learning groups), while their aim will be to train civil servants in understanding and reaping the benefits from eGov services.
# to provision for alignment between this training approach and ECVET recommendations
# to deploy a multilingual online environment (COMPAT.eGov portal) in which users will be able to access content (in the form of Digital Training Objects / DTO’s and Digital Competence Models / DCMs) related to the project’s approach in the area of eGov competence assessment and training
# to carry out a set of pilot sessions with a number of representative user groups (civil servants from the participating public authorities) and to evaluate the proposed approach.
# finally, to formulate a set of policy recommendations to policy makers and regional authorities about ways they can use the outcomes of the project in order to support the eGov competence assessment and training

== Results on which the Project is Based ==
The transfer of innovation and the relevant outcomes / results to be exploited within COMPAT.eGov are based on a series of previous projects: 
* Rural Inclusion ICT PSP Project

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2567">'''''El Jabato''''' (lit. "The young wild [[boar]]") is the hero of a series of [[Spain|Spanish]] [[comic book]]s, created in 1958 by the writer [[Víctor Mora (comics)|Víctor Mora]] and illustrated mainly by [[Francisco Darnís]]. ''El Jabato'''s themes and cast of characters were similar to those of the other series created by Mora, ''[[Capitán Trueno]]'', although ''El Jabato'' is set in [[ancient Rome]], while Capitán Trueno was a [[knight-errant]] of the [[Middle Ages]].

''El Jabato'' concerns the adventures of two [[Iberians|Iberian]] warriors, El Jabato and a giant, gluttonous sidekick, Taurus, who are taken from their native lands by the invading [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] armies. A third character (the girl), named Claudia, a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] girl who eventually embraces [[Christianity]], is also introduced in the first issue of the series.   

A fourth character was subsequently added. This was Fideo de Mileto (Phideus of [[Miletus]]), a very minor [[ancient Greece|Greek]] poet who torments Taurus with his endless verses, with which he narrates the adventures of his friends.  Fideo carries a [[lyre]] (which Taurus has attempted to destroy more than once), and fights his enemies with his musical powers. Even later, more characters were added: a boy named Tai-Li, a [[tiger]] named Bambú, and a [[monkey]] named Bongo.  

The series was immensely popular in Spain, especially during the time of the [[Spain under Franco|dictatorship]]. The main series had an uninterrupted run for 381 issues, before it was affected by the Spanish comic-book crisis that eventually affected all Spanish titles. In addition to the main series another magazine (El Jabato Extra) run for 51 issues plus one special. El Jabato also had an additional series of adventures published inside the magazine "El Capitán Trueno Extra", between the issues 176 and 333.

In 1989 it was adapted into a video game.

'''Eritrea–Yemen relations''' refers to the [[bilateralism|current and historical relationship]] between [[Eritrea]] and [[Yemen]]. The states fought briefly over the [[Hanish Islands]] in the [[Red Sea]] in 1995. In 2004, Eritrean President [[Isaias Afewerki]] was invited to and visited Yemen for a two-day working visit. He was accompanied by a number of government ministers and high-ranking military personnel, including foreign minister [[Ali Said Abdella]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eritreaembassy.co.za/press%20Release/Press-release013.htm President Isaias Afewerki Visits Yemen] Embassy of the State of Eritrea in South Africa, 11 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hanish Islands conflict==
 {{main|Hanish Islands conflict}}
The Hanish Islands conflict was a dispute between the two countries over the island of [[Greater Hanish]] in the [[Red Sea]], one of the largest in the Zukur-Hanish archipelago, which was disputed between Yemen and Eritrea. Fighting took place over three days from 15 December to 17 December 1995. It was an Eritrean military victory by the second day, and the Eritreans held the islands until 1998. In 1998, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] determined that the archipelago belonged to Yemen.

The '''International Innovation Index''' is a global index measuring the level of [[innovation]] of a country, produced jointly by [[The Boston Consulting Group]] (BCG), the [[National Association of Manufacturers]] (NAM), and The Manufacturing Institute (MI), the NAM's nonpartisan research affiliate. NAM describes it as the "largest and most comprehensive global index of its kind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nam.org/NewsFromtheNAM.aspx?DID={8D10F9A6-28AE-456D-97EA-340146144190} America Ranks #8 In New Global Innovation Index]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Innovation Index is part of a large research study that looked at both the business outcomes of innovation and government's ability to encourage and support innovation through [[public policy]]. The study comprised a survey of more than 1,000 senior executives from NAM member companies across all industries; in-depth interviews with 30 of the executives; and a comparison of the "innovation friendliness" of 110 countries and all 50 U.S. states. The findings are published in the report, "The Innovation Imperative in Manufacturing: How the United States Can Restore Its Edge."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industryweek.com/public-policy/us-ranks-8-global-innovation-index U.S. Ranks #8 In Global Innovation Index], Industryweek.com, Mar 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The report discusses not only country performance but also what companies are doing and should be doing to spur innovation. It looks at new policy indicators for innovation, including tax incentives and policies for [[immigration]], [[education]] and [[intellectual property]].

== Large country ranking ==
The index was published in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themanufacturinginstitute.org/~/media/6731673D21A64259B081AC8E083AE091.ashx The Innovation Imperative in Manufacturing: How the United States Can Restore Its Edge]&lt;/ref&gt; To rank the countries, the study measured both innovation inputs and outputs. Innovation inputs included government and [[fiscal policy]], [[education policy]] and the innovation environment. Outputs included [[patents]], [[technology transfer]], and other [[R&amp;D]] results; business performance, such as [[labor productivity]] and total shareholder returns; and the impact of innovation on business migration and [[economic growth]]. The following is a list of the twenty largest countries (as measured by [[GDP]]) by the International Innovation Index:

'''Kaposszentjakab''' (the former name was '''Zselicszentjakab''') was a village where the ordo Saint Benedict built a monastery.

==History==
The village was the place of a [[St Benedict]] monastery in the [[Árpád]] age. Some lands in the village were the private properties of the Genere Győr. In 1256 the members of the [[Győr (genus)|Genere Győr]] had given their [[Zselicszentjakab Abbey|Zselicszentjakab]] [[family monastery]] to [[Pannonhalma Archabbey]]. In 1328 the Genere Győr (Péter and Miklós, sons of Derzs) and the abbot of Zselicszentjakab changed back the lands of the monastery by the lands of [[Rábacsécsény]] at the Pannonhalma Archeabbey.

==Zselicszentjakab in our days==
Today the old village is part of the county capital town [[Kaposvár]]. The [[Somogy County]] villages suffered great devastation during the Turkish wars, and Zselicszentjakab monastery was also destroyed.

==Sightseeings==
The ruins of the old [[St Benedict]] Monastery was renovated and a beautiful excursion place is the old monastery district in the southeastern egde of [[Kaposvár]]. The ruins shows the ground plan of the church building and the monastery. The church had 3 naves. Architectural comparisons proved the eastern connections of the central space, with four columns. This church also belonged to the Eastern Orthodox (Caucasian, Byzantine) tradition related churches in Hungary, which were found at least at 5 churches: [[Tarnaszentmária]], [[Feldebrő]], [[Székesfehérvár]], [[Szekszárd]] and here in Zselicszentjakab. Ruins of a central spaced chapel can also be found north of the monastery buildings.

[[File:EmbassyRU LUX.jpg|thumb|Russian embassy in Luxembourg.]]

'''Luxembourg–Russia relations''' ({{lang-ru|Российско-люксембургские отношения}}, {{lang-lb|Lëtzebuergesch-Russesch Relatiounen}}) are the [[bilateralism|bilateral]] [[International relations|foreign relations]] between the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] ([[Member state of the European Union|member-state]] of the [[European Union]]) and the [[Russian Federation]]. Luxembourg has an embassy in [[Moscow]] and an honorary consulate in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Russia has an embassy in the city of [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]].

Both countries are full members of the [[Council of Europe]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], and the [[United Nations]].

In the history of bilateral relations, the first Russian president to come on an official visit to Luxembourg was [[Vladimir Putin]] on 24 May 2007. As bilateral trade had more than tripled from USD 66.6 million in 2003 to USD 228.3 million in 2006, time had come to strengthen the ties between the two countries, energy and finance being the key areas of cooperation between Russia and Luxembourg.

== Russian immigrant workers in Luxembourg ==
In 1926 about a hundred [[White émigré]] families, mostly former officers, came over Bulgaria to Luxembourg to work mainly in the flourishing iron ore industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ng.ru/style/2001-02-15/16_memory.html Life of Sergey Pukh]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1982, the Grand Duchy has a [[Russian Orthodox Church in Luxembourg|Russian Orthodox Church]]. On 1 June 2008 there were 943 Russians registered in Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecp.public.lu/repertoire/stats/2008/06/index.html Répertoire des personnes physiques]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 South Ossetia War==
During the [[2008 South Ossetia War]], Luxembourg claimed that Russia violated [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1808]] which Russia had voted for only a few months before. Luxembourg criticism escalated especially after its [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia]]. While Luxembourg refuses to recognise either, [[Abkhazia]] is now recognised by 6 UN member states and [[South Ossetia]] by 5, respectively.

'''Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Foundation''' (the '''MiSK Foundation''') ({{lang-ar|مؤسسة الأمير محمد بن سلمان بن عبدالعزيز الخيرية}}) is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] foundation established by Saudi crown prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]] in 2011 to develop and empower Saudi youth to become participants in the future economy. MiSK specifically focuses on four key areas: education, creative and digital media, technology, and culture and arts.  It pursues this agenda both through its own programs, and through partnerships with local and global organisations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/company/announcements/misk-foundation-and-bloomberg/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Created in 2011, the MiSK foundation was initiated by Mohammad bin Salman, then advisor to the Governor of Riyadh. The foundation aims to increase economic opportunities in Saudi society, where seventy percent of the population is under the age of 30, in step with the [[Saudi Vision 2030|Vision 2030]] national restructuring plan.&lt;ref name="devex 90230"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.devex.com/news/q-a-saudi-nonprofit-misk-paves-the-way-for-youth-90230|title=Q&amp;A: Saudi nonprofit MiSK paves the way for youth|website=Devex.com|date=8 May 2017|author=Elizabeth Dickinson|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/world/middleeast/young-saudis-see-cushy-jobs-vanish-along-with-nations-oil-wealth.html|title=Young Saudis See Cushy Jobs Vanish Along With Nation’s Oil Wealth|website=Nytimes.com|date=16 February 2016|author=Ben Hubbard|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MiSK Foundation launched the Tweeps Forum in 2013, an annual networking event connecting the Saudi youth with [[social media]] leaders, gathering speakers such as [[Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], [[Ivanka Trump]], and top executives from [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/334469-ivanka-trump-fills-in-for-her-father-at-tweeps-forum-in-saudi-arabia |title=Ivanka Trump says social media 'empowers the people'|website=Thehill.com|date=21 May 2017|author=Mallory Shelbourne|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emiratespressreleases.com/abdullah-bin-zayed-attends-4th-tweeps-forum-in-riyadh/ |title=Abdullah bin Zayed attends 4th Tweeps Forum in Riyadh|website=Emiratespressrelease.com|date=18 April 2016|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the MiSK Foundation was one of the main partners of the 9th [[UNESCO]] Youth Forum in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/9th-unesco-youth-forum/partners|title=Main sponsors|website=Unesco.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, the two organisations signed a Framework Agreement to collaborate on the development of youth, education, emerging technologies, culture, and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/unesco_and_misk_foundation_join_forces_for_knowledge_societi/ |title=UNESCO and MiSK Foundation join forces for knowledge societies|website=Unesco.org|date=14 September 2016|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th International Forum of NGOs was held in Riyadh in May 2017 in partnership with the MiSK foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/news/youth-and-their-social-impact-7th-international-forum-ngos-official-partnership-unesco|title="Youth and their Social Impact" – 7th International Forum of NGOs in official partnership with UNESCO|website=Unesco.org|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MiSK Global Forum started in 2016 and was initially conceived as a two-day forum, with a focus on entrepreneurship and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustg.com/two-day-misk-global-forum-in-riyadh-showcases-ideas-of-innovation-and-global-culture-to-empower-youth/|title=Two-Day MiSK Global Forum in Riyadh Showcases Ideas of Innovation And Global Culture to Empower Youth|website=Sustg.com|date=15 November 2016|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 25 to 27 November 2016, the MiSK [[Hackathon]] connected more than 100 youths from London and Riyadh by satellite in a competition broadcast over two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-driven-blood-bank-donation-invention-scoops-100k-top-prize-at-inaugural-uksaudi-misk-hackathon-603272386.html|title=Data-Driven Blood Bank Donation Invention Scoops $100k Top Prize at Inaugural UK/Saudi MiSK Hackathon|website=Prnewswire.com|date=27 November 2016|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the Foundation launched a campaign with [[Google]] named ''We Are All Online'', an initiative to share best practices in the promotion of online safety for Saudi youth, one of the most connected nations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-youtube/young-saudis-getting-creative-on-youtube-idUSBRE9AH0GY20131118|title=Young Saudis getting creative on YouTube|website=Reuters.com|date=18 November 2013|author=Matt Smith|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, the Foundation became a member of the [[MIT Media Lab]] consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/30/elite-universities-selling-themselves-mit-harvard-saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman|title=Elite universities are selling themselves – and look who’s buying|website=Theguardian.com|date=30 March 2018|author1=Grif Peterson|author2=Yarden Katz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the MiSK Foundation organised a New York-based youth-oriented forum, the MiSK-UNDP Youth Forum, that drew 400 participants and raised awareness on ways that Saudi and Arab youth could further involve themselves with the issues of counter extremism and the refugee crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/the-americas/youth-take-on-global-challenges-at-saudi-un-forum-1.629112|title=Youth take on global challenges at Saudi-UN forum|website=Thenational.ae|date=16 September 2017|author=Mina Al Oraibi|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, a month after the [[Killing of Jamal Khashoggi|death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi]], the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]  pulled funding to the foundation. The decision ended a joint initiative between the Gates Foundation and the MiSK Foundation called the ''MiSK Grand Challenges'', which made grants to organisations around the world working to create innovative solutions to development challenges. In 2017, the Gates Foundation had committed $5 million to the MiSK Grant Challenges. “Jamal Khashoggi’s abduction and murder are extremely troubling,” said the Gates Foundation in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/gates-foundation-cuts-ties-with-saudi-charity-over-journalists-murder/|title=Gates Foundation cuts ties with Saudi charity over journalist’s murder|last=Roberts|first=Paul|date=2 November 2018|work=Seattle Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/5147080/gates-foundation-pulls-funding-from-saudi-charity-over-khashoggi-murder/|title=Gates Foundation Pulls Funding From Saudi Charity Over Khashoggi Murder|last=Denny|first=Andrew|date=4 November 2018|work=Inquisitr|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The name of the Foundation comes from "misk" ("[[musk]]" in English). The symbolism is one of generosity and benevolence in that this ancient perfume is worn by one person, while simultaneously engulfing those around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://misk.org.sa/en/about-misk/ |title=About MiSk|website=Misk.org.sa|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation’s work is focused on [[Education in Saudi Arabia|education]], [[Culture of Saudi Arabia|culture]] and [[Media of Saudi Arabia|media]]. It provides contributions to youth development, with a spotlight on technology and the arts, in order to build a knowledge-based economy.&lt;ref name="devex 90230"/&gt; The MiSK Foundation also tackles problems related to terrorism by convening events both in Saudi Arabia and internationally, including the annual Tweeps Forum and the MiSK UNDP Youth Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uae/the-national-news/20170917/281539406128649|title=Youth has its say|website=Pressreader.com|date=17 September 2017|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MiSK Art Institute ==
The MiSK Art Institute, launched in 2017, is the artistic branch of the MiSK Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/saudi-arabia-s-crown-prince-adds-art-and-culture-to-his-portfolio|title=Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince launches institute to promote art in the Middle East|website=Theartnewspaper.com|date=8 December 2017|author=Anna Somers Cocks|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the institute is to become the "leading platform for grassroots cultural production, diplomacy and exchange" in Saudi Arabia. [[Ahmed Mater]] serves as its executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/culture/20171012-art-contemporain-saoudien-arabie-saoudite-surprise-unesco-ahmed-mater-incense-route|title=L’art contemporain saoudien, une bonne surprise exposée à l’Unesco|website=Rf1.fr|date=12 October 2017|author=Siegfried Forster|language=fr|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2018, the Foundation announced the expansion of the MiSK Art Institute, including new galleries, creative spaces, meeting spaces, workshops, and educational programs. The Institute also included plans for a pavilion at the 2018 [[Venice Biennale]], a New York Arab Art Festival, an exchange program with California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-29/saudi-arabia-is-planning-a-massive-new-arts-center|title=Saudi Arabia Is Planning a Massive, New Arts Center|website=Bloomberg.com|author=James Tarmy|date=29 January 2018|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Moldovan territory was a part of the [[Principality of Moldavia]] from the 14th century until 1812, when it was [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|ceded]] to the [[Russian Empire]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] (to which Moldavia was a [[Vassal state of the Ottoman Empire|vassal state]]) and became known as [[Bessarabia]]. In 1856, southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia, which three years later united with [[Wallachia]] to form [[United Principalities|Romania]], but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878. During the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], Bessarabia briefly became autonomous and then the independent [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] until it was integrated into [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] in 1918 following a vote of its assembly. The decision was disputed by [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], which in 1924 allowed the establishment, within the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], of a [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian autonomous republic]] (MASSR) on partial Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of the [[Dniester]]. In 1940, as a consequence of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the [[Soviet Union]], leading to the creation of the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Moldavian SSR), which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR.

On 27 August 1991, as the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] was under way, the Moldavian SSR [[Moldovan Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] and took the name Moldova. The [[Constitution of Moldova]] was adopted in 1994. The strip of the Moldovan territory on the east bank of the Dniester river has been under the ''[[de facto]]'' control of the breakaway government of [[Transnistria]] since 1990.

Due to a decrease in industrial and agricultural output following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the [[service sector]] has grown to dominate [[Economy of Moldova|Moldova's economy]] and is over 60% of the nation's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Its economy is the poorest in Europe in per capita terms&lt;ref name="CIA_World_Factbook_Moldova"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/poorest-list/the-10-most-poverty-ridden-countries-in-europe/ |title=The 10 Most Poverty Ridden Countries in Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has the lowest [[Human Development Index]] in the continent. Moldova is also the least visited country in Europe by tourists with only 11,000 annually recorded visitors from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelersdigest.com/7402-ten-least-visited-countries-in-europe/2/|title=The Ten Least Visited Countries in Europe - Page 2 of 2 - Traveler's Digest|date=22 August 2014|website=Travelersdigest.com|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moldova is a [[parliamentary republic]] with a [[President of Moldova|president]] as [[head of state]] and a [[List of Prime Ministers of Moldova|prime minister]] as [[head of government]].

==Etymology==
{{main|Name of Moldova}}

The name "Moldova" derives from the [[Moldova River]]; the valley of this river served as a political centre at the time of the [[Foundation of Moldavia|foundation]] of the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]] in 1359.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.moldova.md/en/istorie/ |title= History, official site of Republic of Moldova |publisher= Republic of Moldova&amp;nbsp;• www.moldova.md |date=  |accessdate= 9 October 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131222142800/http://www.moldova.md/en/istorie/ |archivedate= 22 December 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the name of the river remains unclear. According to a legend recounted by Moldavian chroniclers [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] and [[Grigore Ureche]], Prince [[Dragoș]] named the river after hunting an [[aurochs]]: following the chase, the prince's exhausted hound ''Molda'' drowned in the river. The dog's name, given to the river, extended to the Principality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= King |first= Charles |authorlink= Charles King (professor of international affairs) |title= The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture |publisher= Hoover Press |location= |year= 2000 |chapter= From Principality to Province |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ldBFWtuv8DQC&amp;pg=PA13 |page= 13 |isbn= 0-8179-9792-X |accessdate= 31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a short time in the 1990s, at the founding of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], the name of the current Republic of Moldova was also spelled "Moldavia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/23/world/end-soviet-union-text-accords-former-soviet-republics-setting-up-commonwealth.html?pagewanted=all|date=1991-12-23|title=THE END OF THE SOVIET UNION; Text of Accords by Former Soviet Republics Setting Up a Commonwealth|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=...Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Kirghizia, the Republic of Moldavia, the Russian Federation...}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the country began to use the Romanian name, ''Moldova''.  Officially, the name ''Republic of Moldova'' is designated by the [[United Nations]].

===Prehistory===
[[File:CuTryOutline.svg|thumb|upright=0.65|left|Area of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]].]]
The prehistory of Moldova covers the period from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] which begins with the presence of [[Cro-Magnon|Homo sapiens]] in the area of [[Prehistory of Southeastern Europe|Southeastern Europe]] some 44,000 years ago and extends into the appearance of the first written records in [[Classical Antiquity]] in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]].

In 2010 N.K. Anisjutkin discovered [[Oldowan]] flint tools at Bayraki that are 800,000–1.2 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://paleogeo.org/article3.html|title= GEOARCHAEOLOGY OF THE EARLIEST PALEOLITHIC SITES (OLDOWAN) IN THE NORTH CAUCASUS AND THE EAST EUROPE| publisher= paleogeo.org|date= 2011| dead-url= y| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130520090413/http://paleogeo.org/article3.html| archive-date= 20 May 2013 | quote = Early Paleolithic cultural layers with tools of oldowan type was discovered in East Caucasus (Dagestan, Russia) by Kh.

Anisjutkin (2010).}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Neolithic |Neolithic stone-age]] era, Moldova's territory stood at the centre of the large [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] that stretched east beyond the [[Dniester River]] in Ukraine and west up to and beyond the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in Romania. The people of this civilization, which lasted roughly from 5500 to 2750 BC, practised agriculture, raised livestock, hunted, and made intricately-designed pottery.&lt;ref&gt;

===Moldovan lands in antiquity and the early Middle Ages===
[[File:Bolohoveni land from A.V. Boldur description.PNG|thumb|200px|right|The "land of Bolokhoveni", according to Alexandru V. Boldur.{{sfn|Spinei|1986|p=111}}]]
In [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], Moldova's territory was inhabited by [[Dacians|Dacian]] tribes. Between the 1st and 7th centuries AD, the south was intermittently under the [[Roman Empire|Roman]], and then [[Byzantine Empire]]s. Due to its strategic location on a route between Asia and Europe, the territory of modern Moldova was invaded many times in late antiquity and the [[early Middle Ages]], including by [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Magyars]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]], [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongols]] and [[Mongol and Tatar states in Europe|Tatars]].

The [[Bolokhoveni|Bolohoveni]], a [[Vlachs|Vlach population]], is mentioned by the [[Hypatian Chronicle]] in the 13th century. The chronicle shows that this land is bordered on the principalities of [[Halych]], [[Volhynia]] and [[Kiev]]. Archaeological research also identified the location of 13th-century fortified settlements in this region. Alexandru V. Boldur identified Voscodavie, Voscodavti, Voloscovti, Volcovti, Volosovca and their other towns and villages between the middle course of the rivers Nistru/Dniester and Nipru/Dnieper.&lt;ref&gt;A.V. Boldur, Istoria Basarabiei, Editura V. Frunza, p 111-119&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolohoveni disappeared from chronicles after their defeat in 1257 by [[Daniel of Galicia]]'s troops.

In the early 13th century, the ''[[Brodnici|Brodniks]]'', a possible [[Slavs|Slavic]]&amp;ndash;[[Vlachs|Vlach]] [[vassal]] state of [[Halych-Volhynia|Halych]], were present, alongside the Vlachs, in much of the region's territory (towards 1216, the Brodniks are mentioned as in service of [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Suzdal]]).

On the border between Halych and the Brodniks, in the 11th century, a [[Viking]] by the name of Rodfos was killed in the area by Vlachs who supposedly betrayed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vikingart.com/VArt/PS_Sjonhem.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060616225750/http://www.vikingart.com/VArt/PS_Sjonhem.htm |archivedate=2006-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1164, the future [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[Andronikos I Komnenos]], was taken prisoner by Vlach shepherds around the same region.

===Founding of the Principality of Moldavia===
{{main|Founding of Moldavia}}
[[File:MoldavianPrincipalityPhysical.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Principality of [[Moldavia]] and the modern boundaries of Moldova, Ukraine, and Romania.]]
The [[Founding of Moldavia|founding of the Principality of Moldavia]] began with the arrival of a [[Vlach]] [[voivode]] (military leader), [[Dragoș]], soon followed by his people from [[Maramureș]] to the region of the [[Moldova River]]. Dragoș established a [[polity]] there as a vassal to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 1350s. The independence of the [[Principality]] of [[Moldavia]] was gained when [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan I]], another Vlach voivode from Maramureș who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1359 and took control of Moldavia, wresting the region from Hungary. The Principality of [[Moldavia]] was bounded by the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, the [[Dniester]] River in the east, and the Danube River and [[Black Sea]] to the south. Its territory comprised the present-day territory of the Republic of Moldova, the [[Western Moldavia|eastern eight counties]] of Romania, and parts of the [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and [[Budjak]] region of Ukraine. Like the present-day republic and Romania's north-eastern region, it was known to the locals as ''Moldova''.

===Between Poland and Hungary===
[[File:Polska 1386 - 1434.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of the [[Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] between 1386–1434 showing the [[Principality of Moldavia]] as a Polish fief.]]

The history of what is today Moldova has been intertwined with that of Poland for centuries. The Polish chronicler [[Jan Długosz]] mentioned Moldavians (under the name ''Wallachians'') as having joined a military expedition in 1342, under King [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław I]], against the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Jan Długosz'', p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish state was powerful enough to counter the [[Hungarian Kingdom]] which was consistently interested in bringing the area that would become Moldova into its political orbit.

Ties between Poland and Moldavia expanded after the founding of the Moldavian state by [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan of Cuhea]], a Vlach [[voivode]] from [[Maramureș]] who had fallen out with the Hungarian king. Crossing the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1359, the voivode took control of Moldavia, and succeeded in creating Moldavia as an independent political entity. Despite being disfavored by the brief union of [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Angevin Poland]] and Hungary (the latter was still the country's overlord), Bogdan's successor [[Lațcu of Moldavia|Lațcu]], the Moldavian ruler also likely allied himself with the Poles. Lațcu also accepted [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] around 1370, but his gesture was to remain without consequences. 

[[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru I]] profited from the end of the Hungarian-Polish union and moved the country closer to the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon realm]], becoming a [[Vassalage|vassal]] of [[Władysław II Jagiełło|Władysław II]] on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the [[Teutonic Knights]], and was granted control over [[Pokuttya]] until the debt was to be repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the [[Battle of Obertyn]] (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the [[Danube Delta]]. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Cetatea Albă]] in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the [[Black Sea]], before being toppled from the throne for supporting [[Fyodor Koriatovych]] in his conflict with [[Vytautas the Great]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Under [[Stephen I of Moldavia|Stephen I]], growing Polish influence was challenged by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], whose expedition was defeated at [[Ghindăoani]] in 1385; however, Stephen disappeared in mysterious circumstances.

Although [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]] was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from [[Mircea I of Wallachia]]), this ruler shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and the [[Siege of Marienburg (1410)|Siege of Marienburg]]), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign was one of the most successful in Moldavia's history.

===The Ottomans===

For all of his success, it was under the reign of Alexander I that the very first confrontation with the [[Ottoman Turks]] took place at Cetatea Albă in 1420. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru's long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]] and the ascension of [[Peter III Aaron]] in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as [[Matthias Corvinus]] deposed Aron and backed [[Alexăndrel]] to the throne in [[Suceava]]. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's [[Ottoman Empire]] allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay [[tribute]] to Sultan [[Mehmed II]].

During this time, Moldavia was invaded repeatedly by Crimean [[Tatars]] and, beginning in the 15th century, by the Turks. In 1538, the principality became a [[tribute|tributary]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]], but it retained internal and partial external autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/moldova/3.htm|title=Moldova: Early History|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=June 1995|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1600, [[Michael the Brave]] removed [[Ieremia Movilă]] from Moldavia's throne by winning the battle of [[Bacău]], briefly reuniting under his rule [[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]], and [[Transylvania]]. A Polish army led by [[Jan Zamoyski]] drove the Wallachians from Moldavia and reinstalled Ieremia Movilă to the throne, who put the country under the vassalage of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Moldavia finally returned to Ottoman vassalage in 1621.

While [[Transnistria]] was never politically part of the Principality of Moldavia, there were sizable areas which were owned by Moldavian boyars and given by the Moldavian rulers. The earliest surviving deeds referring to lands beyond the Dniester river date from the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sava, p.4-6&lt;/ref&gt; Moldavian chronicle [[Grigore Ureche]] which mentions that in 1584, some Moldavian villages from beyond the Dniester in the [[Kingdom of Poland]] were attacked and plundered by [[Cossacks]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Grigore Ureche]] ''[[s:ro:Letopiseţul ţărâi Moldovei, de când s-au descălecat ţara|Letopiseţul ţărâi Moldovei, de când s-au descălecat ţara]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Many Moldovans were members of Cossacks units as well, with two of them, [[Ioan Potcoavă]] and [[Danylo Apostol|Dănilă Apostol]] becoming [[hetman]]s of [[Ukraine]]. [[Ruxandra Lupu]], the daughter of Moldavian voivode [[Vasile Lupu]] who married [[Tymish Khmelnytsky]], lived in [[Raşcov]] according to Ukrainian tradition.

While most of today's Moldova came into the Ottoman orbit in the 16th century, a substantial part of [[Transnistria]] remained a part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] until the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793.

===Modern history===

====Russian Empire====
In accordance with the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1812|Treaty of Bucharest of 1812]], and despite numerous protests by Moldavian nobles on behalf of the sovereignty of their principality, the [[Ottoman Empire]] (of which Moldavia was a [[Vassal state|vassal]]) ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] the [[Bessarabia|eastern half of the territory]] of the Principality of Moldavia along with [[Khotyn]] and old Bessarabia (modern [[Budjak]]), which Russia had already conquered and annexed. The new Russian province was called [[Bessarabia Governorate|Oblast of Moldavia and Bessarabia]], and initially enjoyed a large degree of autonomy. After 1828 this autonomy was progressively restricted and in 1871 the Oblast was transformed into the Bessarabia Governorate, in a process of [[Forced assimilation|state-imposed assimilation]], [[Russification]]. As part of this process, the [[Tsarist]] administration in Bessarabia gradually removed the [[Romanian language]] from official and religious use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_10.shtml#bc_10| title=Bessarabia, Chapter X: The Survival of Roumanian| first=Charles Upson| last=Clark| year=1927| publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company| website=Depts.washington.edu| accessdate=9 October 2013| quote=Naturally, this system resulted not in acquisition of Russian by the Moldavians, but in their almost complete illiteracy in any language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] returned the southern part of Bessarabia (later organised as the [[Cahul County|Cahul]], Bolgrad and Ismail counties) to Moldavia, which remained an autonomous principality and, in 1859, [[Moldavia and Wallachia|united]] with [[Wallachia]] to form [[United Principalities|Romania]]. In 1878, as a result of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], Romania was forced to cede the three counties back to the Russian Empire.

Over the 19th century, the Russian authorities encouraged the [[colonization]] of Bessarabia by [[Romanians]], [[Russians in Moldova|Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Bessarabian Germans|Germans]], [[Bessarabian Bulgarians|Bulgarians]], and [[Gagauzes]], primarily in the northern and southern areas vacated by Turks and [[Nogais|Nogai]] [[Tatars|Tatar]], the latter having been expelled in the 1770s and 1780s, during [[Russo-Turkish Wars]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ualberta.ca/%7Egerman/PAA/Bessarabians.htm |title=The Germans from Bessarabia |publisher=Ualberta.ca |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926121442/http://www.ualberta.ca/~german/PAA/Bessarabians.htm |archivedate=26 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washington"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_8.shtml#bc_8|title=Bessarabia, Chapter VIII: Russia Organizes the Province|author=Charles Upson Clark| year=1927| publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company| website=Depts.washington.edu| accessdate=9 October 2013| quote=Today, the Bulgarians form one of the most solid elements in Southern Bessarabia, numbering (with the Gagauzes, i.e., Turkish-speaking Christians also from the Dobrudja) nearly 150,000.

====Russian Revolution and Greater Romania====
[[File:Greater Romania.svg|thumb|200px|A map of [[Greater Romania]] between 1920 and 1940.]]
[[World War I]] brought in a rise in political and cultural (ethnic) awareness among the inhabitants of the region, as 300,000 Bessarabians were drafted into the [[Red Army|Russian Army]] formed in 1917; within bigger units several "Moldavian Soldiers' Committees" were formed. Following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]], a Bessarabian parliament, [[Sfatul Țării]] (a National Council), was [[Sfatul Țării election, 1917|elected in October–November 1917]] and opened on {{OldStyleDate|December 3|1917|21 November}}. The Sfatul Țării proclaimed the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] ({{OldStyleDate|December 15|1917|2 December}}) within a federal Russian state, and formed a [[Pantelimon Erhan Cabinet|government]] ({{OldStyleDate|21 December|1917|8 December}}).

Bessarabia proclaimed independence from Russia on {{OldStyleDate|February 6|1918|24 January}} and requested the assistance of the French army present in Romania (general [[Henri Mathias Berthelot|Henri Berthelot]]) and of the [[Romanian army]], which had occupied the region in early January at the request of the National Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} Anthony Babel: ''La Bessarabie (Bessarabia)'', Félix Alcan, Genève, Switzerland, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; On {{OldStyleDate|April 9|1918|27 March}}, the Sfatul Țării decided with 86 votes for, 3 against and 36 abstaining, to [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|unite with the Kingdom of Romania]].

In May 1919, the [[Bessarabian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was proclaimed as a government in exile. After the failure of the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] in 1924, the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Moldavian ASSR) was formed by Soviet Russia within the territory of the [[Ukrainian SSR]], the present-day [[Transnistria]].

====World War II and Soviet era====

In August 1939, the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and its secret additional protocol were signed, by which [[Nazi Germany]] recognized Bessarabia as being within the [[Soviet sphere of influence]], which led the latter to actively revive its claim to the region.&lt;ref name="Olson 1994 483"&gt;{{cite book |last=Olson |first=James |title=An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires |year=1994 |page=483}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June 1940, the Soviet Union issued an [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|ultimatum to Romania]] requesting the cession of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, with which Romania complied the following day. Soon after, the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Moldavian SSR, MSSR) was established,&lt;ref name="Olson 1994 483"/&gt; comprising about 65% of Bessarabia, and 50% of the now-disbanded Moldavian ASSR.

As part of the 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]], Romania regained the territories of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, and seized [[Transnistria Governorate|Transnistria]].

Its identity with the Romanian language was also established.&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lang law"&gt;{{cite web|format=DOC|url=http://www.iatp.md/ladom/downloads/M3.doc|title=Legea cu privire la functionarea limbilor vorbite pe teritoriul RSS Moldovenesti Nr.3465-XI din 01.09.89 Vestile nr.9/217, 1989|trans-title=The law on use of languages spoken in the Moldovan SSR No.3465-XI of 09/01/89|volume=9|issue=217|language=ro|work=Moldavian SSR News, Law regarding the usage of languages spoken on the territory of the Republic of Moldova|accessdate=11 February 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219024839/http://www.iatp.md/ladom/downloads/M3.doc|archivedate=19 February 2006|quote='''[TRANSLATION]''' Moldavian SSR supports the desire of the Moldovans that live across the borders of the Republic, and considering the existing linguistic Moldo-Romanian identity – of the Romanians that live on the territory of the USSR, of doing their studies and satisfying their cultural needs in their native language.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, as opposition to the [[Communist Party of Moldova|Communist Party]] grew, there were [[1989 Moldova civil unrest|major riots in November]].

The [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 1990|first democratic elections]] for the local [[Moldovan Parliament|parliament]] were held in February and March 1990. [[Mircea Snegur]] was elected as [[Speaker of the Moldovan Parliament|Speaker of the Parliament]], and [[Mircea Druc]] as Prime Minister. On 23 June 1990, the Parliament adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of the "Soviet Socialist Republic Moldova", which, among other things, stipulated the supremacy of Moldovan laws over those of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt; After the failure of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]], [[Declaration of Independence of Moldova|Moldova declared its independence]] on 27 August 1991.

On 21 December of the same year, Moldova, along with most of the other Soviet republics, signed the constitutive act that formed the post-Soviet [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS). Moldova received official recognition on 25 December. On 26 December 1991 the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Declaring itself a [[neutral state]], Moldova did not join the military branch of the CIS. Three months later, on 2 March 1992, the country gained formal recognition as an independent state at the United Nations. In 1994, Moldova became a member of [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] program, and a member of the Council of Europe on 29 June 1995.&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt;

In the region east of the [[Dniester]] river, [[Transnistria]], which includes a large proportion of predominantly [[russophone]] [[East Slavs]] of Ukrainian (28%) and Russian (26%) descent (altogether 54% as of 1989), an independent [[Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was proclaimed on 16 August 1990, with its capital in [[Tiraspol]].&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt; The motives behind this move were fear of the rise of nationalism in Moldova. In the winter of 1991–1992 clashes occurred between Transnistrian forces, [[14th Army involvement in Transnistria|supported by elements of the 14th Army]], and the [[Law enforcement in Moldova|Moldovan police]]. Between 2 March and 26 July 1992, the conflict escalated into a [[War of Transnistria|military engagement]].

On 2 January 1992, Moldova introduced a [[market economy]], liberalizing prices, which resulted in rapid inflation. From 1992 to 2001, the country suffered a serious economic crisis, leaving most of the population below the poverty line. In 1993, the government introduced a new national currency, the [[Moldovan leu]], to replace the [[Moldovan cupon|temporary cupon]]. The [[economy of Moldova]] began to change in 2001; and until 2008 the country saw a steady annual growth between 5% and 10%. The early 2000s also saw a considerable growth of emigration of Moldovans looking for work (mostly illegally) in Russia (especially the Moscow region), Italy, Portugal, Spain, and other countries; [[remittance]]s from Moldovans abroad account for almost 38% of Moldova's [[GDP]], the second-highest percentage in the world, after [[Tajikistan]] (45%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ratha|first1=Dilip|authorlink=Dilip Ratha|url=http://peoplemove.worldbank.org/en/content/remittance-flows-to-developing-countries|title=Remittance flows to developing countries are estimated to exceed $300 billion in 2008|publisher=peoplemove.worldbank.org|date=18 February 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223020016/http://peoplemove.worldbank.org/en/content/remittance-flows-to-developing-countries|archivedate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home/news-and-views/press-briefing-notes/pbn-2008/pbn-listing/information-campaign-in-moldova-seeks-to.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085911/https://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home/news-and-views/press-briefing-notes/pbn-2008/pbn-listing/information-campaign-in-moldova-seeks-to.html |archivedate=7 April 2014 |title=Information Campaign to Increase the Efficiency of Remittance Flows |publisher=International Organization for Migration |date=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 1994|1994 parliamentary elections]], the [[Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova|Democratic Agrarian Party]] gained a majority of the seats, setting a turning point in Moldovan politics. With the nationalist Popular Front now in a parliamentary minority, new measures aiming to moderate the ethnic tensions in the country could be adopted. Plans for a [[Movement for the unification of Romania and Moldova|union with Romania]] were abandoned,&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt; and the new [[Constitution of Moldova (1994)|Constitution]] gave autonomy to the breakaway Transnistria and Gagauzia. On 23 December 1994, the Parliament of Moldova adopted a "Law on the Special Legal Status of Gagauzia", and in 1995 the latter was constituted.

After winning the [[Moldovan presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential elections]], on 15 January 1997, [[Petru Lucinschi]], the former First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Moldova|Moldavian Communist Party]] in 1989–91, became the country's second president (1997–2001), succeeding Mircea Snegur (1991–1996). In 2000, the Constitution was amended, transforming Moldova into a [[parliamentary republic]], with the president being chosen through [[indirect election]] rather than direct popular vote.

[[Moldovan parliamentary election, 2001|Winning 49.9% of the vote]], the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]] (reinstituted in 1993 after being outlawed in 1991), gained 71 of the 101 MPs, and on 4 April 2001, elected [[Vladimir Voronin]] as the country's third president (re-elected in 2005). The country became the first post-Soviet state where a non-reformed Communist Party returned to power.&lt;ref name="lang matei"/&gt; New governments were formed by [[Vasile Tarlev]] (19 April 2001 – 31 March 2008), and [[Zinaida Greceanîi]] (31 March 2008 – 14 September 2009). In 2001–2003 [[Moldova–Russia relations|relations between Moldova and Russia]] improved, but then temporarily deteriorated in 2003–2006, in the wake of the failure of the [[Kozak memorandum]], culminating in the [[2006 Russian ban of Moldovan and Georgian wines|2006 wine exports crisis]]. The Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova managed to stay in power for eight years. The fragmentation of the liberal bloc (helped consolidate its power. The decline of the Communist Party started in 2009 after Marian Lupu joined the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Ion |last=Marandici |title=The Factors Leading to the Electoral Success, Consolidation and Decline of the Moldovan Communists' Party During the Transition Period |date=23 April 2010 |work=Midwestern Political Science Association Convention |publisher=Social Science Research Network |ssrn=1809029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, four Moldovan parties (Liberal Democratic Party, Liberal Party, [[Democratic Party of Moldova|Democratic Party]], and Our Moldova Alliance) agreed to create the [[Alliance For European Integration]] that pushed the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]] into opposition. On 28 August 2009, this coalition chose a new [[Speaker of the Moldovan Parliament|parliament speaker]] ([[Mihai Ghimpu]]) in a vote that was boycotted by Communist legislators. [[Vladimir Voronin]], who had been [[President of Moldova]] since 2001, eventually resigned on 11 September 2009, but the [[Moldovan presidential election, November–December 2009|Parliament failed to elect a new president]]. The acting president Mihai Ghimpu instituted the [[Commission for constitutional reform in Moldova]] to adopt a new version of the Constitution of Moldova.

In November 2014, Moldova's central bank took control of ''Banca de Economii'', the country's largest lender, and two smaller institutions, ''Banca Sociala'' and ''Unibank''. Investigations into activities at these three banks uncovered a [[Moldovan bank fraud scandal|large-scale fraud]] by means of fraudulent loans to business entities controlled by a Moldovan-Israeli oligarch, [[Ilan Shor]], of funds worth about 1 billion U.S. dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intellinews.com/audit-links-local-tycoon-to-1bn-moldovan-bank-fraud-500446512/?source=moldova&amp;archive=bne |title=Audit links local tycoon to $1bn Moldovan bank fraud |publisher=Business New Europe |date=5 May 2015 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large scale of the fraud compared to the size of the Moldovan economy are cited as tilting the country's politics in favour of the pro-Russian [[Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Higgins |first1=Andrew |title=Moldova, Hunting Missing Millions, Finding Only Ash |date=4 June 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=10 March 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/world/europe/moldova-bank-theft.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Shor was still at large, after a period of house arrest.

==Government==
{{main|Politics of Moldova}}
[[File:Parliament Building in Chișinău.jpg|thumb|The [[Moldovan Parliament]]]]

Moldova is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative]] democratic [[republic]]. The 1994 Constitution of Moldova sets the framework for the government of the country. A parliamentary majority of at least two-thirds is required to amend the [[Constitution of Moldova]], which cannot be revised in time of war or national emergency. Amendments to the Constitution affecting the state's sovereignty, independence, or unity can only be made after a majority of voters support the proposal in a referendum. Furthermore, no revision can be made to limit the fundamental rights of people enumerated in the Constitution.&lt;ref name="const"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-democracy.md/en/legislation/constitution/ |title=The Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, 2000 |publisher=E-democracy.md |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's central legislative body is the [[unicameral]] [[Moldovan Parliament]] (''{{lang|ro|Parlament}}''), which has 101 seats, and whose members are elected by popular vote on [[proportional representation|party lists]] every four years.

The head of state is the President of Moldova, who between 2001 and 2015 was elected by the Moldovan Parliament, requiring the support of three-fifths of the deputies (at least 61 votes). The president of Moldova has been elected by the parliament since 2001, a change designed to decrease executive authority in favour of the legislature. Nevertheless, the [[Constitutional Court of Moldova|Constitutional Court]] ruled on 4 March 2016, that this constitutional change adopted in 2000 regarding the presidential election was unconstitutional,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jurnal.md/ro/justitie/2016/3/4/decis-seful-statului-va-fi-ales-de-popor-modificarea-din-2000-a-constitutiei-privind-alegerea-presedintelui-de-parlament-neconstitutionala/ |title=DECIS: Şeful statului va fi ales de popor; Modificarea din 2000 a Constituţiei privind alegerea preşedintelui de Parlament, NECONSTITUŢIONALĂ |newspaper=[[Jurnalul Național]] |date=4 March 2016 |language=Romanian |trans-title=DECIDED: The president will be elected by the people;  The 2000 amendment of the Constitution concerning the election of the President by Parliament unconstitutional }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus reverting the election method of the President to a [[two-round system]] [[direct election]].

The president appoints a [[List of Prime Ministers of Moldova|prime minister]] who functions as the [[head of government]], and who in turn assembles a [[Cabinet of Moldova|cabinet]], both subject to parliamentary approval.

The 1994 constitution also establishes an [[Judicial independence|independent]] [[Constitutional Court of Moldova|Constitutional Court]], composed of six judges (two appointed by the President, two by Parliament, and two by the Supreme Council of [[magistrate|Magistrature]]), serving six-year terms, during which they are irremovable and not subordinate to any power. The Court is invested with the power of [[judicial review]] over all acts of the parliament, over presidential decrees, and over international treaties, signed by the country.&lt;ref name="const"/&gt;

===Internal affairs===
On 19 December 2016, Moldovan MPs approved raising the retirement age to 63 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/19/europes-poorest-nation-passes-imf-backed-retirement-age-increase.html|title=Europe’s poorest nation passes IMF-backed retirement age increase|first=|last=CNBC|date=19 December 2016|website=Cnbc.com|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the current level of 57 for women and 62 for men, a reform that is part of a 3-year-old assistance program agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The retirement age will be lifted gradually by a few months every year until coming fully into effect in 2028.

Life expectancy in the ex-Soviet country - Europe's poorest - is 67.5 years for men and 75.5 years for women. In a country with a population of 3.5 million, of which 1 million are abroad, there are more than 700,000 pensioners.

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign Relations of Moldova|Moldova–European Union relations}}
[[File:European Union Moldova Locator.svg|thumb|Accession to the [[European Union|EU]] is a central issue in Moldovan politics]]

After achieving independence from the Soviet Union, Moldova's foreign policy was designed with a view to establishing relations with other European countries, neutrality, and European Union integration. In 1995 the country was admitted to the [[Council of Europe]].

In addition to its participation in [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] programme, Moldova is also a member state of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|la Francophonie]] and the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]].

In 2005, [[Moldova and the EU]] established an action plan that sought to improve collaboration between its two neighbouring countries, Romania and Ukraine. At the end of 2005 EUBAM, the [[European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine]], was established at the joint request of the presidents of Moldova and Ukraine. EUBAM assists the Moldovan and Ukrainian governments in approximating their border and customs procedures to EU standards, and offers support in both countries' fight against cross-border crime.

After the 1990–1992 [[War of Transnistria]], Moldova sought a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the Transnistria region by working with Romania, Ukraine, and Russia, calling for international mediation, and co-operating with the OSCE and UN fact-finding and observer missions. The [[foreign minister of Moldova]], [[Andrei Stratan]], repeatedly stated that the Russian troops stationed in the breakaway region were there against the will of the Moldovan government and called on them to leave "completely and unconditionally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/marches/moldova-calls-on-russian-troops-to-leave-transdniestr-574221 |title=Moldova Calls on Russian Troops To Leave Transdniestr}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a [[2012 Moldova security zone incident|security zone incident]] resulted in the death of a civilian, raising tensions with [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ellen |last=Barry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/04/world/europe/shooting-raises-tensions-between-moldova-and-russia.html |title=Shooting at Checkpoint Raises Tensions in a Disputed Region Claimed by Moldova |work=The New York Times |date=3 January 2012 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The signing comes after the accord has been initialed in Vilnius in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/top_stories/2014/270614_association_agreement_en.htm|title=European Union – EEAS (European External Action Service) – EU forges closer ties with Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova|website=Eeas.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-14-511_en.htm|title=European Commission – PRESS RELEASES – Press release – Remarks by President Barroso at the signing of the Association Agreements with Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine|website=Europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be said that religious leaders play a role in shaping foreign policy.  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Government has frequently used its connections with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to block and stymie the integration of former Soviet states like Moldova into the West.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Higgins, "In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower," [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/europe/russia-orthodox-church.html ''The New York Times'', September 13, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moldovan armed forces consist of the [[Moldovan Ground Forces|Ground Forces]] and [[Moldovan Air Force|Air Force]]. Moldova has accepted all relevant arms control obligations of the former Soviet Union. On 30 October 1992, Moldova ratified the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], which establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment and provides for the destruction of weapons in excess of those limits. The country acceded to the provisions of the nuclear [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in October 1994 in [[Washington, D.C.]] It does not have nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. Moldova joined the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] on 16 March 1994.

Moldova is committed to a number of international and regional control of arms regulations such as the UN Firearms Protocol, Stability Pact Regional Implementation Plan, the UN Programme of Action (PoA) and the OSCE Documents on Stockpiles of Conventional Ammunition.

Since declaring independence in 1991, Moldova has participated in UN peacekeeping missions in Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, Sudan and Georgia.

Moldova signed a military agreement with Romania to strengthen regional security. The agreement is part of Moldova's strategy to reform its military and cooperate with its neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moldova's military agreements to help strengthen regional security|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/2013/12/21/news/moldovas-military-agreements-to-help-strengthen-regional-security/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904002008/http://www.turkishweekly.net/2013/12/21/news/moldovas-military-agreements-to-help-strengthen-regional-security/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 September 2015|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 2014, the US donated to Moldovan Armed Forces 39 [[Humvees]] and 10 trailers, with a value of US$700,000, to the 22nd Peacekeeping Battalion of the Moldovan National Army to "increase the capability of Moldovan peacekeeping contingents."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moldova.usembassy.gov/111214.html|title=2014 – Embassy of the United States Chișinău, Moldova|website=Moldova.usembassy.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904002008/http://moldova.usembassy.gov/111214.html|archivedate=4 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===

According to [[Amnesty International]], as of 2004 "Torture and other ill-treatment in police detention remained widespread; the state failed to carry out prompt and impartial investigations and police officers sometimes evaded penalties.

According to [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|Human Rights Report]] of the [[United States Department of State]], released in April 2011, "In contrast to the previous year, there were no reports of killings by security forces.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Map of administrative divisions of Moldova|left}}
{{main|Administrative divisions of Moldova|List of cities in Moldova|List of localities in Moldova|Communes of Moldova}}

Moldova is divided into 32 districts (''raioane'', singular ''[[raion]]''), three municipalities and two autonomous regions ([[Gagauzia]] and [[Transnistria autonomous territorial unit|Transnistria]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://descentralizare.gov.md/regionmap.php?l=ro&amp;idc=310|title=Autorități publice locale|publisher=Government of Moldova|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final status of Transnistria is [[Disputed status of Transnistria|disputed]], as the central government does not control that territory. Other 10 cities, including the [[Comrat]] and [[Tiraspol]], the administrative seats of the two autonomous territories, also have [[municipiu|municipality status]].

Moldova has 66 cities (towns), including 13 with municipality status, and 916 communes. Another 700 villages are too small to have a separate administration, and are administratively part of either cities (41 of them) or communes (659). This makes for a total of 1,682 localities in Moldova, two of which are uninhabited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistica.md/public/files/Clasificatoare/CUATM_rom.zip Clasificatorul unităţilor administrativ-teritoriale (CUATM)] {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toltre FTȘT-52.JPG|thumb|right|Toltrele Prutului near [[Fetești, Edineț|Fetești]], [[Edineț District]]]]

Moldova lies between latitudes [[45th parallel north|45°]] and [[49th parallel north|49° N]], and mostly between meridians [[26th meridian east|26°]] and [[30th meridian east|30° E]] (a small area lies east of 30°). The total land area is 33,851&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

The largest part of the nation lies between two rivers, the [[Dniester]] and the [[Prut]]. The western border of Moldova is formed by the Prut river, which joins the [[Danube]] before flowing into the [[Black Sea]]. Moldova has access to the Danube for only about {{convert|480|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and [[Giurgiulești]] is the only Moldovan port on the Danube. In the east, the Dniester is the main river, flowing through the country from north to south, receiving the waters of [[Răut]], [[Bîc]], [[Ichel]], [[Botna]]. [[Ialpug]] flows into one of the Danube [[Liman (landform)|limans]], while [[Cogîlnic River|Cogîlnic]] into the Black Sea chain of limans.

The country is landlocked, though it is close to the Black Sea. While most of the country is hilly, elevations never exceed {{convert|430|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} – the highest point being the [[Dealul Bălănești|Bălănești Hill]]. Moldova's hills are part of the Moldavian Plateau, which geologically originate from the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. Its subdivisions in Moldova include the Dniester Hills (Northern Moldavian Hills and [[Dniester-Rāut Ridge|Dniester Ridge]]), the Moldavian Plain (Middle Prut Valley and [[Bălți Steppe]]), and the Central Moldavian Plateau ([[Ciuluc-Soloneț Hills]], [[Cornești Hills]]—[[Codri]] Massive, "Codri" meaning "forests"—[[Lower Dniester Hills]], [[Lower Prut Valley]], and [[Tigheci Hills]]). In the south, the country has a small flatland, the [[Bugeac Plain]]. The territory of Moldova east of the river Dniester is split between parts of the [[Podolian Plateau]], and parts of the [[Eurasian Steppe]].

The country's main cities are the capital Chișinău, in the centre of the country, Tiraspol (in the eastern region of Transnistria), Bălți (in the north) and Bender (in the south-east). [[Comrat]] is the administrative centre of Gagauzia.

===Climate===
Moldova has a climate which is moderately continental; its proximity to the [[Black Sea]] leads to the climate being mildly cold in the autumn and winter and relatively cool in the spring and summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Moldova.htm |title=Moldova's Climate |publisher=Weatheronline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summers are warm and long, with temperatures averaging about {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} and the winters are relatively mild and dry, with January temperatures averaging {{convert|-4|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Annual rainfall, which ranges from around {{convert|600|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the north to {{convert|400|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the south, can vary greatly; long dry spells are not unusual. The heaviest rainfall occurs in early summer and again in October; heavy showers and thunderstorms are common. Because of the irregular terrain, heavy summer rains often cause erosion and river silting.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Moldova was {{convert|41.5|°C|1|abbr=on}} on 21 July 2007 in [[Camenca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stînga Nistrului |url=http://www.weather-forecast.com/locations/Camenca |title=Camenca temperature |publisher=Weather-forecast.com |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-35.5|°C|1|abbr=on}} on 20 January 1963 in Brătușeni, Edineț county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Bratuseni-weather/Gagauzia/MD.aspx |title=Bratuseni temperature |publisher=Worldweatheronline.com |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the breakup from the USSR in 1991, energy shortages, political uncertainty, trade obstacles and weak administrative capacity contributed to the decline of economy. As a part of an ambitious economic liberalization effort, Moldova introduced a convertible currency, liberalized all prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises, backed steady land privatization, removed export controls, and liberalized interest rates. The government entered into agreements with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to promote growth. 
The economy reversed from decline in late 90's. Since 1999 the GDP (PPP) had a steady growth as follows:&lt;ref name="CIA_World_Factbook_Moldova"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=md&amp;v=65| title=Moldova – GDP (purchasing power parity) – Historical Data Graphs per Year| website=Indexmundi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although estimates point to possible modest overvaluation of the real exchange rate, external competitiveness appears broadly adequate as reflected in strong sustained export performance.&lt;ref name="imf.org"&gt;{{cite press release|format=PDF |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr14190.pdf |title=2014 Article IV consultation and first post-program monitoring discussions – Staff report; press release; and statement by the Executive Director for the Republic of Moldova |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] |issue=IMF Country Report No. 14/190 |date=July 2014 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the near-term economic outlook is weak. Main risks to the near-term outlook relate to serious vulnerabilities and governance issues in the banking sector, policy slippages in the run up to the elections, intensification of geopolitical tensions in the region, and a further slowdown in activity in main trading partners.

Moldova remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in remittances from workers abroad (24 percent of GDP), exports to the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) and [[European Union]] (EU) (88 per cent of total exports), and donor support (about 10 per cent of government spending). The main transmission channels through which adverse exogenous shocks could impact the Moldovan economy are: remittances (also due to potentially returning migrants), external trade, and capital flows.

Staff's spillover analysis suggests that further strengthening of fiscal and external buffers would be critical for mitigating the impact of external shocks, particularly in light of the Moldova's strong links and synchronized business cycle with trading partners.&lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt;

Moldova largely achieved the main objectives of the combined ECF/EFF (IMF financial credit) supported program that expired on 30 April 2013. The economy has strongly recovered from the drought-related contraction in 2012 but will slow down in 2014. Key risks to the near-term outlook relate to financial stability, fiscal policy slippages in the run up to the 2014 parliamentary elections, a further slowdown in activity in main trading partners, and intensification of geopolitical tensions.&lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt;

Corporate governance in the banking sector is a major concern. In line with FSAP recommendations, significant weaknesses in the legal and regulatory frameworks must be urgently addressed to ensure stability and soundness of the financial sector. Moldova has achieved a substantial degree of fiscal consolidation in recent years, but this trend is now reversing. Resisting pre-election pressures for selective spending increases and returning to the path of fiscal consolidation would reduce reliance on exceptionally-high donor support. Structural fiscal reforms would help safeguard sustainability.&lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt; Monetary policy has been successful in maintaining inflation within the NBM's target range. The implementation of structural reforms outlined in the National Development Strategy (NDS) Moldova 2020—especially in the business environment, physical infrastructure, and human resources development areas—would help boost potential growth and reduce poverty.&lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt; Moldova's remarkable recovery from the severe recession of 2009 was largely the result of sound macroeconomic and financial policies and structural reforms. Despite a small contraction in 2012, Moldova's economic performance was among the strongest in the region during 2010–13. Economic activity grew cumulatively by about 24 percent; consumer price inflation was brought under control; and real wages increased cumulatively by about 13 percent. This expansion was made possible by adequate macroeconomic stabilization measures and ambitious structural reforms implemented in the wake of the crisis under a Fund-supported program. In November 2013, Moldova initialed an Association Agreement with the EU which includes provisions establishing a [[Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area]] (DCFTA).

A political crisis in early 2013 led to policy slippages in the fiscal and financial areas. The political crisis that broke out in early 2013 was resolved with the appointment of a government supported by a pro-European center-right/center coalition in May 2013.

Despite a sharp decline in poverty in recent years, Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe and structural reforms are needed to promote sustainable growth. Based on the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional poverty line of US$5/day (PPP), 55 percent of the
population was poor in 2011. While this was significantly lower than 94 percent in 2002, Moldova's poverty rate is still more than double the ECA average of 25 percent. The NDS—Moldova (National Development System) 2020, which was published in November 2012, focuses on several critical areas to boost economic development and reduce poverty. These include education, infrastructure, financial sector, business climate, energy consumption, pension system, and judicial framework. Following the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|regional financial crisis in 1998]], Moldova has made significant progress towards achieving and retaining macroeconomic and financial stabilization. It has, furthermore, implemented many structural and institutional reforms that are indispensable for the efficient functioning of a market economy. These efforts have helped maintain macroeconomic and financial stability under difficult external circumstances, enabled the resumption of economic growth and contributed to establishing an environment conducive to the economy's further growth and development in the medium term.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The government's goal of [[Moldova–European Union relations|EU integration]] has resulted in some market-oriented progress. Moldova experienced better than expected economic growth in 2013 due to increased agriculture production, to economic policies adopted by the Moldovan government since 2009, and to the receipt of EU trade preferences connecting Moldovan products to the world's largest market. Moldova has signed the [[Moldova–European Union Association Agreement|Association Agreement]] and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the European Union during summer 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF |url=http://www.gov.md/sites/default/files/document/attachments/7048451_en_acord_asociere.pdf |title=Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part |publisher=Government of the Republic of Moldova |date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moldova has also achieved a Free Visa Regime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/moldova/travel_eu/index_en.htm|title=European Union|website=Eeas.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the EU which represents the biggest achievement of Moldovan diplomacy since independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|format=PDF |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/jha/141491.pdf |title=Visa liberalisation for Moldova |publisher=Council of the European Union |date=14 March 2014 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, growth has been hampered by high prices for Russian natural gas, a Russian import ban on Moldovan wine, increased foreign scrutiny of Moldovan agricultural products, and by Moldova's large external debt. Over the longer term, Moldova's economy remains vulnerable to political uncertainty, weak administrative capacity, vested bureaucratic interests, corruption, higher fuel prices, Russian pressure, and the separatist regime in Moldova's Transnistria region.&lt;ref name="indexmundi.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/moldova/economy_profile.html|title=Moldova Economy Profile 2014|website=Indexmundi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===
{{Main|Energy in Moldova}}

With few natural energy resources, Moldova imports almost all of its energy supplies from Russia and Ukraine. Moldova's dependence on Russian energy is underscored by a growing US$5 billion debt to Russian natural gas supplier Gazprom, largely the result of unreimbursed natural gas consumption in the separatist Transnistria region. In August 2013, work began on a new pipeline between Moldova and Romania that may eventually break Russia's monopoly on Moldova's gas supplies.&lt;ref name="indexmundi.com"/&gt; Moldova is a partner country of the EU [[INOGATE]] energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing [[energy security]], [[Technological convergence|convergence]] of member state [[energy market]]s on the basis of [[Internal energy market|EU internal energy market]] principles, supporting [[sustainable energy]] development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inogate.org|title=INOGATE website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moldova's [[Chernozem|rich soil]] and [[temperate]] [[continental climate]] (with warm summers and mild winters) have made the country one of the most productive agricultural regions since ancient times, and a major supplier of agricultural products in southeastern Europe. In agriculture, the economic reform started with the land cadastre reform.&lt;ref name="cadastre law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lex.justice.md/md/295776/|title=Legea cu privire la secţiile pentru reforma agrară în cadrul organelor de autoadministrare locală ale Republicii Moldova Nr.129 din 02.03.92, Monitorul Oficial nr.3/80, 1992|trans-title=Law on Land Reform for the local self-administration of the Republic of Moldova Nr.129 from 02/03/92|issue=3|language=ro|work=Monitorul oficial|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main means of transportation in Moldova are railways {{convert|1138|km|mi|abbr=on}} and a highway system ({{convert|12730|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} overall, including {{convert|10937|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} of paved surfaces). The sole international air gateway of Moldova is the [[Chișinău International Airport]]. The [[Giurgiulești]] terminal on the [[Danube]] is compatible with small seagoing vessels. Shipping on the lower [[Prut]] and [[Nistru]] rivers plays only a modest role in the country's transportation system.

The term "Moldavian" had initially described the inhabitants of the Moldavian Principality. In 1775, Austria annexed the northern part of the principality, thenceforth known as Bukovina; a second partition in 1812 resulted in Russia's annexation of the eastern part of Moldavia, thenceforth known as [[Bessarabia]]. {{citation needed span|The partitioned Moldavians did not undergo the same nation-building processes as did their ethnic counterparts in the Danubian Principalities, which identified as the new Romania. Thus, Romanian-language speakers in Bessarabia clung to a "Moldavian" identity.|date=April 2018}}

In the beginning of the 20th century, what is now Moldova was populated by [[Romanians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Russians]], [[Poles]], [[Bulgarians]], along with a nomadic [[Nogais|Nogai]] [[Tatar]] population. In 1927, [[Columbia University]] Professor [[Charles Upson Clark]], wrote that the lower Dniester was "an almost purely Romanian stream" since 1792.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_29.shtml Charles Upson Clark]&lt;/ref&gt; 
A Moldavian identity prevailed in Bessarabia into the interwar period, whereas a Romanian one had developed among ethnic Romanians in Bukovina even before the Great Union. Peasants in all three parts: Romanian, Austrian, and Russian, of historic Moldavia were more likely to identify as Moldavians than were educated city dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Livezeanu|first1=Irina|title=CULTURAL POLITICS IN GREATER ROMANIA: REGIONALISM, NATION BUILDING &amp; ETHNIC STRUGGLE, 1918–1930|date=2000|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically Russian was taught in schools as the first foreign language, because of the relationship with the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. In the 21st century, the primary foreign language taught in the schools is English. In 2013 more than 60% of schoolchildren took it as their first foreign language. This was followed by [[French language|French]], taken by less than 50% of students. Since 1996, the Republic of Moldova has been a full member of [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]].

==Culture==
[[File:Eminescu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mihai Eminescu]], the national poet of Moldova and Romania]]
{{main|Culture of Moldova}}
Moldova's cultural tradition has been influenced primarily by the [[Origin of the Romanians|Romanian origins]] of its majority population, the roots of which go back to the 2nd century AD, the period of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colonisation in [[Dacia]].&lt;ref name="culture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/moldova/18.htm|title=Moldova - Culture|website=Countrystudies.us|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located geographically at the crossroads of [[Italic peoples|Latin]], [[Slavic people|Slavic]] and other cultures, Moldova has enriched its own culture adopting and maintaining some of the traditions of its neighbours and of other influence sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Octavian Sofransky |format=PDF |url=http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/wg3-sofransky.pdf |title=Ethno-Political Conflict in Moldova |publisher=European Centre in Moldova |date= |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest ethnic group, which had come to identify itself widely as "Moldovan" by the 14th century, is a speaker of Romanian and played a significant role in the shaping of [[Culture of Romania#Classical age|classical Romanian culture]], which still has a major role. The culture has been also influenced by the [[Byzantine]] culture, the neighbouring Magyar and Slavic population, and later by the Ottoman Turks. A strong Western European influence in Moldovan literature and arts was prevalent in the 19th century. During the periods 1812-1917 and 1944–89, the eastern Moldovans were influenced by Russian and Soviet administrative control as well and by ethnic Russian immigration.&lt;ref name="culture"/&gt;

The country's cultural heritage was marked by numerous churches and monasteries built by the Moldavian ruler [[Stephen the Great]] in the 15th century, by the works of the later renaissance Metropolitans [[Varlaam, Metropolitan of Moscow|Varlaam]] and [[Dosoftei]], and those of scholars such as [[Grigore Ureche]], [[Miron Costin]], [[Nicolae Milescu]], [[Dimitrie Cantemir]]{{efn|name=fn6|Prince [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] was one of the most important figures of Moldavian culture of the 18th century. He wrote the first geographical, ethnographic and economic description of the country. {{La icon}} ''[[:s:la:Descriptio Moldaviae|Descriptio Moldaviae]]'', (Berlin, 1714), at Latin Wikisource.}} and [[Ion Neculce]]. In the 19th century, Moldavians from the territories of the medieval Principality of [[Moldavia]], divided into [[Bessarabia]], [[Bukovina]], and [[Western Moldavia]] (after 1859, Romania), made a significant contribution to the formation of the modern Romanian culture. Among these were many Bessarabians, such as [[Alecu Donici|Alexandru Donici]], [[Alexandru Hâjdeu]], [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], [[Constantin Stamati]], [[Constantin Stamati-Ciurea]], [[Costache Negruzzi]], [[Alecu Russo]], [[Constantin Stere]].

[[Mihai Eminescu]], a late [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet, and [[Ion Creangă]], a writer, are the most influential [[Romanian language]] artists, considered national writers both in Romania and Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Catherine Lovatt|url=http://www.ce-review.org/00/3/lovatt3.html|title=2000: Year of Eminescu|journal=Central Europe Review|volume=2|issue=3|date=24 January 2000|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has also important minority ethnic communities. Gagauz, 4.4% of the population, are [[Christian]] [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people. [[Greeks]], [[Armenians in Moldova|Armenians]], [[Poles]], Ukrainians, although not numerous, were present since as early as the 17th century, and had left cultural marks. The 19th century saw the arrival of many more Ukrainians from [[Podolia]] and [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], as well as new communities, such as [[Lipovans]], [[Bessarabian Bulgarians|Bulgarians]] and [[Bessarabian Germans]].

===Media===

{{Politics of Côte d'Ivoire}}
'''Nationalist Party''' (in [[French language|French]]: ''Parti Nationaliste''), generally referred to as '''PANA''', was an [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian]] opposition group,  founded in [[Abidjan]] in 1967. It was led by Kraghé Gnagbé. PANA was immediately suppressed by the regime and Gnagbé arrested. Gnagbé had to publicly announce the non-existence of PANA.&lt;ref&gt;Gbagbo, Laurent: ''Côte d'Ivoire, Pour une alternative démocratique''. Paris: L'Harmattan, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Osmanistan''' was a hypothetical name that was proposed by [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]] (but which never materialised) for an independent state to be created as a successor to the [[Princely State]] of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] which existed in the [[British India|Presidencies and Provinces of British India]] before the departure of the British. The [[princely states]] that existed before independence of India in 1947 were given the choice of joining one of the new dominions, [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] or [[Union of India|India]], or in some cases, remain independent. The [[Nizam]] of Hyderabad initially chose to join neither India nor Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lumby | first=E.W.R. | title=The Transfer of Power in India, 1945–1947 | publisher=George Allen and Unwin | place=London | year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later declared Hyderabad a free, self-governing independent state but the Government of India refused to accept his point of view as Hyderabad was surrounded by India on all sides and did not have access to the sea. When the Indian Army invaded his princely State on 13 September 1948 (see [[Operation Polo]]), his forces were unable to withstand the Indian army and were defeated. The Nizam was forced to accept accession to India. The former princely state was reorganised in 1956 and its territories are now parts of the current Indian states of [[Telangana]], Maharashtra and [[Karnataka]].

==History==
At the time of [[Partition of India|partition of British India]] and cessation of the British [[suzerainty]] over the princely states of India, the states had the choice of joining one of the new dominions, [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] or [[Union of India|India]], or remaining independent as per Article 2.4 of the Indian Independence Act 1947 passed by British parliament.

The [[Princely State]] of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] was a princely state with a Muslim ruler, [[Nizam]] [[Osman Ali Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Talbot | first=Phillips | title=Kashmir and Hyderabad | journal=World Politics | volume=1 | issue=3 | year=1949 | pages=321–332 | doi=10.2307/2009033 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | jstor=2009033}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim nobility and the [[Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen]], a powerful pro-Nizam Muslim party, insisted that Hyderabad must remain an independent state and stand on an equal footing to India and Pakistan.  

The Nizam chose for his state to remain independent. He issued a ''[[Firman (decree)|firman]]'' announcing that Hyderabad would remain independent and not join the Union of India&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lumby |first=E.W.R.| title=The Transfer of Power in India, 1945–1947 | publisher=George Allen and Unwin | place=London | year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Government of India rejected the firman, terming it a "[[Legalism (Western philosophy)|legalistic claim]] of doubtful validity". His minister Kasim Razvi unfurled the Asafia Flag and declared that the flag was the emblem of the suzerainty of God on earth. The Deccan Chronicle newspaper of Hyderabad reported on 24 June 1947, "His Exalted Highness will assume Sovereign status and powers on or about August 15, 1947, by which time it is expected that the Indian and Pakistan areas would have assumed the status of Dominions of the British Common Wealth."&lt;ref&gt;http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/1882/11/11_chapter7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Osmanistan" was never used.

On 13 September 1948 the [[Operation Polo|Indian Army entered]] Hyderabad, which was unable to withstand the attack and was quickly overrun, with the last [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] [[Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII]] forced to surrender and accept accession to India.

[[File:Op Polo Surrender.jpg|180px|thumb|[[General El Edroos]] (at right) offers his surrender of the [[Hyderabad State]] Forces to Major General (later General and Army Chief) [[Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri]] at [[Secunderabad]] ]]

For the reason of frailty, the idea of Osmanistan in [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]]'s scheme, was eventually let off in the demand for Pakistan as it was "impracticable" (because Hyderabad was surrounded by India on all sides and did not have an access to sea.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-78yjVybQfkC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=osmanistan+hyderabad&amp;source=web&amp;ots=EJZgFA7X0B&amp;sig=AQ85j7Fy-C-GbnlSRmZk2K15xBY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result|title=The Idea of Pakistan|last=Cohen|first=Stephen P.|date=21 September 2004|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=0815797613|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former princely state Hyderabad was reorganised in 1956 and its territories are now parts of the current Indian states of [[Maharashtra]], Karnataka and [[Telangana]].

==Rahmat Ali's plan==
{{Main|Pakistan Declaration}}
Chaudhry's scheme did not initially call for an Osmanistan. Later, on 8 March 1940, he proposed a new scheme for the establishment of Pakistan, Bangalistan ([[East Bengal]]) and Osmanistan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} After the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]'s acceptance of the British partition plan on 3 June 1947 he issued a statement six days later called "The Great Betrayal" in asking for the rejection of the British plan and the acceptance of his Pakistan plan "to prevent the great evil of Hindu hegemony on Indian Muslims". In the end the British plan was accepted, and his was rejected for the aforementioned pragmatic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-78yjVybQfkC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=osmanistan+hyderabad&amp;source|title=The Idea of Pakistan|last=Cohen|first=Stephen P.|date=21 September 2004|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=0815797613|page=52|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Choudhry Rahmat Ali]] lived most of his adult life in England and came to [[Pakistan]] only on 6 April 1948. He died in February 1951 and was buried on 20 February at Newmarket Road Cemetery, [[Cambridge]], UK.

'''Radio Luxembourg''' was a multilingual commercial broadcaster in [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]]. It is known in most non-English languages as RTL (for Radio Television Luxembourg).

The English-language service of Radio Luxembourg began in 1933 as one of the earliest commercial radio stations broadcasting to the UK and Ireland. It was an important forerunner of [[pirate radio]] and modern commercial radio in the United Kingdom. It was an effective way to advertise products by circumventing British legislation which until 1973 gave the [[BBC]] a monopoly of radio broadcasting on UK territory and prohibited all forms of advertising over the domestic [[radio spectrum]]. It boasted the most powerful privately owned transmitter in the world (1,300&amp;nbsp;kW broadcasting on medium wave). In the late 1930s, and again in the 1950s and 1960s, it captured very large audiences in Britain and Ireland with its programmes of popular entertainment.

Radio Luxembourg's parent company, [[RTL Group]], continued its involvement in broadcasts for a UK audience with the British TV channel then known as [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]] until it was sold in July 2010.

==Background==
In 1922, the British government awarded a monopoly broadcasting licence to a single [[British Broadcasting Company]], whose shares were owned by British and American electrical companies. Although in theory the BBC could have sold sponsored airtime, it attempted to gain its revenue by selling its own brand of licensed radio receivers manufactured by the member companies of the BBC. This arrangement lasted until 1927, when the broadcasting licence of the original BBC was allowed to expire. The assets of the former commercial company were then sold to a new non-commercial [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], which operated under a UK charter from [[the Crown]].

With no possibility of commercial broadcasting available from inside the UK, a former British [[Royal Air Force]] captain and entrepreneur (and from 1935 [[Conservative Party UK|Conservative Party]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|member of parliament]]) named [[Leonard Plugge|Leonard F. Plugge]] set up his own [[International Broadcasting Company]]. The IBC began leasing time on transmitters in continental Europe and then reselling it as sponsored English-language programming aimed at audiences in Britain and Ireland. Because Plugge successfully demonstrated that State monopolies such as that of the BBC could be broken, other parties became attracted to the idea of creating a new commercial radio station specifically for this purpose.

In the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] during 1924, [[François Anen]] built a [[Amateur radio|100-watt]] transmitter to broadcast [[Military band|military music]] concerts and plays to listeners in Luxembourg. Because the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is centrally located in western Europe, it was an ideal location for transmitters aimed at reaching audiences in many nations, including the United Kingdom. Anen became inspired by the activities of Captain Plugge, who was using transmitters licensed in other countries to broadcast English-language radio programmes to Britain and Ireland, where commercial broadcasting had not been licensed by the British or Irish governments. On 11 May 1929, he brought together a group of mainly French entrepreneurs and formed the Luxembourg Society for Radio Studies (''La Société Luxembourgeoise d'Etudes Radiophoniques'') as a [[pressure group]] to force the Luxembourg government to issue them a commercial broadcasting licence.&lt;ref&gt;Walter B. Emery, ''National and International Systems of Broadcasting'', Michigan State University Press, 1969, pp.158–159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Leonard, ''From International Waters'' Forest Press, Heswall, 1996, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 1929, the government of Luxembourg passed a law awarding a monopoly licence to operate a commercial radio broadcasting franchise from the Grand Duchy. On 29 December, this licence was awarded to the Society, which in turn created the '''Luxembourg Broadcasting Company''' ([[RTL Group|Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Radiodiffusion]]) to be identified on the air as '''Radio Luxembourg'''.

In May 1932, Radio Luxembourg began high powered test transmissions aimed directly at Britain and Ireland (which proved, inadvertently, to be the first radio modification of the [[ionosphere]]).&lt;ref name="Gakona HAARPoon 2017"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/alaska.edu/gakonahaarpoon/operations-news |title=kona HAARPoon 2017 |date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reaction of the British government was hostile, as the [[Longwave|long-wave band]] used for these tests radiated a signal far superior to anything previously received from outside the country. The British government accused Radio Luxembourg of "pirating" the various wavelengths it was testing. The station had planned to commence regular broadcasts on 4 June 1933, but the complaints caused Radio Luxembourg to keep shifting its wavelength. On 1 January 1934, a new international agreement, the "Lucerne Convention (European Wavelength Plan)" (which the Luxembourg government refused to sign), came into effect, and shortly afterwards Radio Luxembourg started a regular schedule of English-language radio transmissions from 8:15 am until midnight on Sundays, and at various times during the rest of the week.

Radio Luxembourg began broadcasting in both the French and English languages on a new 200&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter on 230&amp;nbsp;kHz (1304 metres) in the long-wave band. The English service was leased to [[Radio Publicity (London) Ltd]] in the United Kingdom. In December 1933, they transferred 23-year-old [[Stephen Williams (Radio Luxembourg)|Stephen Williams]] from directing their English-language programmes transmitted over [[Radio Paris]] to become the first manager of the English language service of Radio Luxembourg.

==First commercial era==

===1933–1939===
In the years from 1933 to 1939, the English language service of Radio Luxembourg gained a large audience in Britain, Ireland and many other European countries with sponsored programming aired from noon until midnight on Sundays and at various times during the rest of the week. 11% of Britons listened to it during the week, preferring Luxembourg's light music and variety programmes to the BBC. Up to half of Britons did so before 10:15 am on weekdays when the BBC did not broadcast, and on weekends when it followed the "[[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Reith Sunday]]" schedule of only serious and religious programmes. The BBC and successive British governments continued to oppose the competition, citing Radio Luxembourg's use of an unauthorized frequency. As the station could not use [[General Post Office]] telephone lines to broadcast from London, many English-language programmes were recorded there on one-sided 16-inch discs running at 33 revolutions per minute and flown to Luxembourg. Despite the opposition, by 1938, many British companies advertised on Radio Luxembourg and fellow European broadcaster [[Radio Normandy]]. The stations thus exposed millions of Britons and British companies to commercial broadcasting, which contributed to the creation of the commercial [[ITV Network|ITV]] during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="nicholas1999"&gt;{{cite book | title='Millions like us'? : British culture in the Second World War | publisher=Liverpool University Press | chapter=The People's Radio: The BBC and its Audience, 1939–1945 | first=Siân| last=Nicholas | editor1-first = Nick | editor1-last = Hayes | editor2-first = Jeff | editor2-last = Hill | year=1999 | pages=66 | isbn=0-85323-763-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wilson1961"&gt;{{cite book | title=Pressure Group: The Campaign for Commercial Television in England | publisher=Secker and Warburg | author=Wilson, H.

==World War II==

===1940–1945===
On 21 September 1939, the [[Luxembourg]] government closed the radio station down to protect the neutrality of the country during World War II. The station and its transmitters were taken over by the [[German invasion of Luxembourg|invading German forces]] in 1940, and were used for English-language propaganda broadcasts by [[William Joyce]] (''"[[Lord Haw-Haw]]"'') and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hanson | first1 = Elizabeth C. | title = The Information Revolution and World Politics | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | year = 2008 | pages = 32 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8fieK2s1QsMC&amp;dq | accessdate = 2012-10-26 | isbn = 978-0742538535}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Allied forces took over Luxembourg in September 1944, the station was transferred to [[US Army]] control and used for [[black propaganda]] purposes for the remainder of the war (see [[Radio 1212]]).

==Second commercial era==

===1946–1956===

When the Allied armed forces vacated the Radio Luxembourg premises at the close of World War II, the English-language service attempted to restart transmissions to the United Kingdom as a full-time commercial radio station using the European long-wave band, once more under the management of Stephen Williams.

During the war [[Geoffrey Everitt]] served his last few months in Luxembourg and this led to his employment by Stephen Williams on 21 June 1946. Williams soon left the station and Everitt found himself in charge of a small on-air staff of three women and one man. Because of the dearth of advertising available in English, the early morning shows on long wave quickly disappeared and made way for French-language programmes. More contractions followed and this led to cuts in more of the morning, afternoon and evening programming in English.

By the start of the 1950s, sponsorship of the English service had begun to grow once more, and while initially some of the English-language programmes continued via ''Radio Luxembourg I'' on long wave, a second but less powerful wavelength was opened up as ''Radio Luxembourg II'' on medium wave. The English programmes of Radio Luxembourg moved on July 2, 1951 from long wave to the medium wave frequency of 208 metres (1439&amp;nbsp;kHz). The controversy over the station's broadcasting frequencies had been resolved with the [[Copenhagen Frequency Plan of 1948|1948 Copenhagen plan]] (which this time the Luxembourg government did sign), which allocated the country two high-power frequencies, one on long wave and the other on medium wave. Eventually all English programming moved to medium wave, with long wave being dedicated to French programmes,  while German, Dutch and other languages used medium wave during the daytime.

In 1955, [[Hal Lewis (Aku)|Hal Lewis]] who was better known at Hawaiian radio station [[KPOA (AM)|KPOA]] as ''J. Akuhead Pupule'' (and later became the morning DJ at [[KSSK-FM|KGMB]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] during 1965), offered to buy the morning time from 6 am to 9 am for his own show on ''208'', but his offer was rejected. The ''208'' signal could be received satisfactorily in the United Kingdom only after dark, when it was able to strike the [[ionosphere]] and bounce back to the British Isles.

It was this second wavelength that eventually became dedicated to English-language programming after 6 pm under the slogan of "''208 – Your station of the stars''", referring to the entertainers heard on the station.

**11:00 pm – ''Bringing Christ to the Nations – [[The Lutheran Hour]]''.

Radio Luxembourg also served as a refuge for stars and shows previously heard on the BBC but with whom the BBC had fallen out for one reason or another. Thus, when in 1951 the BBC wanted [[Vera Lynn]], one of its biggest singing stars, to perform more upbeat material than her traditional repertoire, she refused, and signed up to record 42 shows for Luxembourg instead – which, she said, also paid better. Likewise, the comedy series ''[[Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh]]'', terminated by the BBC after six years, transferred to Radio Luxembourg for a period in 1950–51 before the BBC relented and revived the show.&lt;ref&gt;George Nobbs, ''The Wireless Stars'', Norwich, 1972, SBN 903 61900 8&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 1956, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine reported that "[[WINS (AM)|WINS]] Radio made a deal with [[Harry Alan Towers]] of the Towers of London, for [[deejay]] [[Alan Freed]] to do a special taped 1/2 hour [[rock and roll]] record show on Saturday nights over Radio Luxembourg, which is beamed to most of the countries of Free Europe."

===1954–1963===
[[File:Expo58 radio luxembourg.jpg|thumb|right|Radio Luxembourg at [[Expo 58]] in Brussels, Belgium. July 1958.]]
Following the merger of the English-language service of Radio Luxembourg I with the new English-language service of Radio Luxembourg II on 208 metres medium wave, the station came to be known as Radio Luxembourg. A British company, Radio Luxembourg (London) Ltd, controlled the programme content and sold the advertising time.

The station sign-on time at dusk varied between summer and winter to allow maximum benefit to be gained from a [[Skywave|skywave propagation]] at night that covered the British Isles, although reception was stronger in northern England. By restricting the service to night-time, the sales representatives were able to sell most of the available airtime both for spot commercials and for sponsored programmes. One spot commercial that became burned into the minds of every Radio Luxembourg listener was for [[Horace Batchelor]]'s "Infra-Draw Method" of winning money on [[football pools]], turning the previously obscure Somerset town of "[[Keynsham]], spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M" into a household name throughout the country.

Programmes were partly live disc-jockey presentations by the team of "resident announcers" from the studios in [[Luxembourg City]], partly shows pre-recorded in the company's UK studios at 38 Hertford Street, London W1. This was not made clear to listeners, who were allowed to form the incorrect impression that all the presenters were sitting in the Grand Duchy or, alternatively, that they were indeed in London but performing live via a hypothetical landline to Luxembourg – a landline which in reality the British government was never prepared to permit until well into the 1980s.

A strange conspiracy of silence operated throughout this period between sworn enemies Radio Luxembourg and the BBC, each of which never mentioned the existence of the other, although many famous names appeared on both, often almost simultaneously.

====Programmes====
During this period, and particularly from about 1960, the station's output came to be more explicitly targeted at the growing teenage market, with increasing emphasis on a pop music format. Drama productions, comedy, variety and sports programming disappeared altogether. By about 1963, almost the station's entire output was based around the playing of music on discs. This must have greatly reduced its production costs. It also reflected the fact that the mainstream evening audience for middle-aged "family entertainment" had by this time largely migrated to television.

These were some of the shows heard in December 1956, as listed in the ''208'' programme schedule for that month:
*'''Sundays''': 6:00 pm – [[Butlins|''Butlin's Beaver Club'']] – with "Uncle" [[Eric Winstone]].
**8:30 pm – ''[[Take Your Pick]]'' – with [[Michael Miles]].
**9:30 pm – ''[[This I Believe]]'' – the [[Edward R. Murrow]] show presented by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0058776/ Sir Basil Bartlett].
*'''Mondays''': 9:30 pm – ''[[Candid Microphone]]'' – starring listeners caught in the act.
**11:15 pm – [[Frank and Ernest (broadcast)|''Frank and Ernest'']] – religion from [[Dawn Bible Students Association]].
**11:30 pm – [[The World Tomorrow (1934)|''The World Tomorrow'']] – with [[Herbert W. Armstrong]], later heard on Tuesdays as well replacing [[Oral Roberts]].
*'''Tuesdays''': 9:00 pm – ''Lucky Number'' – with Keith Fordyce.
**10:00 pm – ''The Capitol Show'' – Mel Thompson presenting [[Capitol Records]]' new releases.
*'''Wednesdays''': 8:00 pm – ''[[Double Your Money]]'' – [[Hughie Green]].

The following were some of the resident announcers in Luxembourg during this period:
*[[Barry Alldis]] – joined the team in 1956, becoming Chief Announcer and staying until 1966, when he left to work for BBC radio. He returned to Luxembourg in 1975 and remained on the staff until his death in 1982.

*[[Ted King (presenter)|Ted King]]
*[[Johnny Moran]]
*[[Don Moss]] 1957–60
*[[Don Wardell]] (became Chief Announcer after Barry Alldis left in 1966)

The following disc-jockeys recorded shows in the London studios at 38 Hertford Street: Peter Aldersley, [[Sam Costa]], [[Alan Dell]], [[Keith Fordyce]], [[Alan Freeman]], [[David Gell]], [[Tony Hall (disk jockey)|Tony Hall]], [[Jack Jackson (British radio)|Jack Jackson]], [[David Jacobs (broadcaster)|David Jacobs]], [[Brian Matthew]], Don Moss, [[Pete Murray (DJ)|Pete Murray]], Ray Orchard, [[Jimmy Savile]], [[Shaw Taylor]], [[Jimmy Young (broadcaster)|Jimmy Young]], and [[Muriel Young]]. Many of these programmes were sponsored by record companies, and in order to include as many records as possible, most programmes played little more than half of each record.

===1964–1967===
Radio Luxembourg had enjoyed its own commercial radio monopoly of English-language programming heard in the UK but, in March 1964, [[Radio Caroline]] began daytime commercial radio transmissions to southern England from a ship anchored less than four miles off the coast (the station later acquired a second ship, and moved the first to the Irish Sea). In Caroline's primary reception areas, her groundwave signal was strong and unaffected during daylight hours by fading and interference. Following the success of this first offshore station, others soon followed, mostly broadcasting from locations off the Essex coast or the Thames Estuary. These transmissions were eventually extended around the clock and featured many different broadcasting formats, though pop music on discs predominated.

As a result of this competition, Radio Luxembourg gradually abandoned pre-recorded sponsored programmes for a more flexible continuity. Its new format featured mainly spot advertising within record programmes presented live by resident disc jockeys in Luxembourg, some of them recruited from the offshore stations.

In August 1967, the [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]] passed into law, and forced all but the two Caroline stations off the air by eliminating their means of selling commercial advertising in the UK. As well as closing down offshore "pirate radio", the British government instructed the BBC to create its own non-commercial replacement, named [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]. Radio 1 commenced transmissions at the end of September 1967. While Luxembourg almost had the UK commercial airwaves to itself, it was still restricted to evening and night hours.

===1968–1988===
By the middle of 1968, even the two Caroline offshore stations had left the air and, while other attempts were made to restart offshore radio commercial broadcasts aimed at the UK in the early 1970s, Luxembourg did not face commercial competition, only a growing increase in audience share by more BBC services. For a time in the late 1960s Luxembourg advertised itself as "The O.I.S. - the Only Independent Station on the Air". But in 1973, the BBC radio monopoly was finally ended by new legislation introducing [[Independent Local Radio]], funded by the sale of advertising time.

In 1983, Radio Luxembourg marked its fiftieth anniversary as a station, but the British commercial radio stations kept whittling away the ''208'' audience and advertising, while a brief replay of competition for audiences began to emerge from off the British coastline with new radio ship transmissions.

During the 1980s one of the station's slogans was "Planet earth's biggest commercial radio station".

===1989–1992===
In 1989, hoping to build a new audience, Luxembourg in English once more returned with a daytime schedule for the first time since the early 1950s, but this time it was aimed at [[Scandinavia]]n audiences using a 24-hour [[stereo]] transponder on the [[SES Astra|Astra]] [[Astra 1A|1A]] satellite to supplement the ''208'' analogue night-time service. The end eventually came for ''208'' at 3 am [[GMT]] on 30 December 1991 (the station did return to the analogue 208/1440 for one night a year later when the station finally closed its digital service), with the last record played on AM being [[Van Morrison]]'s "In the Days Before Rock and Roll" (chosen mainly because of its mention of the radio station), before "At the End of the Day" (one of their closedown songs) was played heading into the top of the hour (even though DJ Jeff Graham had said that they were going to play the original closedown tune, it was in fact the original song, but a later version the station used as the original was not located, "It's Time To Say Goodnight"&lt;ref&gt;http://members4.boardhost.com/motland/msg/1172498020.html&lt;/ref&gt;). The station then went satellite and shortwave (15350&amp;nbsp;kHz) only, with the first songs played being "[[When Will You (Make My Telephone Ring)]]" by [[Deacon Blue]] and "[[Always (Atlantic Starr song)|Always]]" by [[Atlantic Starr]].

The satellite and shortwave service continued until midnight on 30 December 1992. The closedown night was relayed on various stations, including the old 208 wavelength. The Van Morrison song was the next-to-last record that night, followed by [[Marion Montgomery]]'s "Maybe the morning".

The 208 service from that moment on carried an oldies service in German, identifying itself as "RTL Radio - Der Oldiesender".

==Legacy from 1992 onwards==

===Atlantic 252===
{{Main article|Atlantic 252}}

In 1989, Radio Luxembourg's parent company [[RTL Group]] teamed up with [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] to create [[Atlantic 252]], an English-language pop music station on [[longwave]], based in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and with advertising content aimed at a UK audience. Initially this only broadcast until 7 pm and ended with an announcement specifically encouraging listeners to switch to Radio Luxembourg on 1440&amp;nbsp;kHz medium wave. Atlantic 252 switched to 24-hour broadcasts around the time that Radio Luxembourg shut down its medium wave broadcasts. Atlantic 252 closed down in 2002 and the long wave frequency is now used for [[RTÉ Radio 1]]. Presenters common to both Atlantic 252 and Radio Luxembourg include Jeff Graham, [[Cass Jones]] and [[Sandy Beech]]. The voice of Henry Owens was also heard on promotions for both stations in the early 1990s.

===Radio Luxembourg (digital)===
{{Main article|Radio Luxembourg (DRM)}}

An English-language classic rock digital station from [[RTL Group]] called Radio Luxembourg began in 2005. It was briefly available in the UK using [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] (digital broadcasts over [[shortwave]]) but the transmitter power was reduced, and by 2008 was not receivable outside Luxembourg itself (essentially, a test transmission). The digital station continues broadcasting over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioluxembourg.co.uk/ www.radioluxembourg.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Both the station and its website make numerous references to the old 208 service.

===Five (television channel)===
{{Main article|Channel 5 (UK)}}

[[RTL Group]], Radio Luxembourg's parent company, was an initial minority shareholder in the UK's Channel Five terrestrial analogue television channel, launched in 1997. RTL became the majority shareholder from 2006, when it had been re-branded as "Five". It was one of more than fifty television stations that RTL owned throughout Europe. Unlike RTL's television stations in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, most of which are explicitly branded as RTL, Five did not significantly acknowledge its Luxembourg heritage on-air. RTL sold Five to [[Richard Desmond]] on 23 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/news/a249183/rtl-sells-channel-five-to-richard-desmond.html RTL sells Channel Five to Richard Desmond]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background information==
Radio Luxembourg was also broadcast on RTL's various European TV channels after closedown.

===Transmitter history===
The wavelengths and frequencies used by the English service of Radio Luxembourg changed throughout the years, although "208" was by far the longest-lasting and most famous one.

*[[Junglinster Longwave Transmitter]]
*[[FM- and TV-mast Hosingen]]

===Radio Luxembourg publications===
*''Radio Pictorial'' – radio publication pre-World War II that published programme schedules for all the European continental stations broadcasting in English
*''Radio Parade'' – radio publication after World War II that published news about Radio Luxembourg in English.
*''208'' – radio programme schedules and features after 1951 until 1959 whose name varied as it was merged with other publications and issued by various publishers.
*''[[Fab 208]]'' – radio programme schedules and features publication during the 1960s and 1970s

===Political significance in Eastern Bloc===
Radio Luxembourg was one of few channels through which people living in the [[Eastern Bloc]] could listen to [[rock music|rock]] and other contemporary popular music. Under good weather conditions, and especially at night, people as far as eastern Czechoslovakia and Estonia could listen to the station. Eastern Bloc governments did not use jammers to prevent people from listening to Radio Luxembourg, but did do so for [[Radio Free Europe]] and, since the stations used [[harmonic frequency|harmonic frequencies]] (1439&amp;nbsp;kHz for Luxembourg and 719&amp;nbsp;kHz for Free Europe), the jamming also affected Radio Luxembourg's signal. Even though western popular music was considered undesirable by socialist regimes, legal prosecution was rare, although not unheard of. The music appealed to young people as something forbidden, and listening to it became a social ritual. It also strongly influenced contemporary underground culture and music in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Štefečková|first1=Veronika|title=Radio Luxembourg and its significance for listeners in socialist Czechoslovakia (oral history)|url=https://is.muni.cz/th/362409/fss_b/Radio_Luxembourg_-_bakalarska_praca_Veronika_Štefečková.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2015|language=Slovak}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laxik.cz/archiv/radio-luxembourg-vedecka-prace-english.pdf|title=Radio Luxembourg and its importance for auditors in the socialist Czechoslovakia (oral history)|last=Štefečková|first=Veronika|date=|website=|publisher=|language=English|format=PDF|access-date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
