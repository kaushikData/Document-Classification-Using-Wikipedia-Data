The '''Academy of Western Artists''', based in [[Gene Autry, Oklahoma|Gene Autry]], &lt;ref&gt;The community of Gene Autry was known as Berwyn from 1887 to 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Oklahoma]], is an organization that honors individuals who have preserved and perpetuated the heritage of the [[United States|American]] [[cowboy]], through [[rodeo]], [[music]], [[poetry]], campfire and [[chuckwagon]] cooking, and [[Western (genre)|western]] and [[ranch]] clothing and gear.
 
The academy seeks to preserve the traditional values associated with the cowboy image despite consolidation in the cattle industry and changes in contemporary society. The group hosts an annual awards show. Its director is the western publisher Bobby Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/academyofwesternartists|title=Academy of Western Artists|publisher=myspace.com|accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1996, the academy began making annual awards at a gathering in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]], specifically to recognize the performers and artisans active in the contemporary cowboy and western movement. The awards have been received by more than 500 individuals in a variety of categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awaawards.org/about.htm |title=About the Academy |publisher=awaawards.org |accessdate=July 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131130821/http://www.awaawards.org/about.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[R.W. Hampton]] received the first [[Will Rogers|Will Rogers Award]]s, named for the cowboy humorist [[Will Rogers]]. He was both "Male Vocalist of the Year" and "Entertainer of the Year" in 1996. A year later, Hampton's album, ''Ridin' The Dreamland Range'', was honored as the association's Album of the Year. Hampton won "Male Vocalist of the Year" again in 1999, 2002, and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awaawards.org/western.htm|title=Western Music Awards|publisher=awaawards.org|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 winner, honored early in 2012 at the 16th annual awards presentation, include Bruce Pollock ([[radio]] [[disc jockey]]), Henry Real Bird and Bette Wolf Duncan (poetry books, ''Horse Tracks'' and ''Dakota'', respectively), The Nugents (young artists), Syd Masters (male singer), and Mary Kaye (female singer), Jimmy Burson and Joni Harms (Western swing), Stardust Cowboys (Western album "Riding Back to You"), Curtis Potter (Country album, "The Potter's Touch"), and B. K. Nuzum (chuckwagon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awaawards.org/current.htm|title=16th Annual Awards Show Winners|publisher=awaawards.org|accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Since 2008, the academy has presented the Will Rogers Medallion Award. This award recognizes outstanding western literature, including books of poetry, fiction, non-fiction, cookbooks, and works for younger readers. One of the 2012 winners is ''Will Rogers - a Political Life'' by Richard D. White of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]], published by the [[Texas Tech University Press]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cowboypoetry.com/willrogers.htm#2012|title=Will Rogers Medallion Award|publisher=cowboypoetry.com|accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On March 29, 2014, the academy presented its first annual fiction and non-fiction Western book awards named in honor of the late novelist [[Elmer Kelton]] of [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]], Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awaawards.org/|title=Elmer Kelton Book Award|publisher=awaawards.org|accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Similar in scope to the Academy of Western Artists is the [[Western Music Association]], incorporated in [[Arizona]] in 1989, which maintains its own [[Western Music Association Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/company/western-music-assn.-&amp;-academy-of-western-artists|title=Western Music Association and Academy of Western Artists|publisher=linkedin.com|accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2015, the Academy will meet in [[Irving, Texas|Irving]], Texas.

'''Aco Šopov''' ({{lang-mk|Ацо Шопов}}, {{IPA-bg|at͡sɔ ˈʃɔpɔf|}}, [[Štip]], 1923 – [[Skopje]], 1982) was a [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] poet. He was considered one of the most important poets of [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acosopov.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in [[World War II in Yugoslavia]] (1941–45) and his poems written at the time were published as ''Pesni'' (Poems) in Belgrade and Kumanovo in 1944, and in Štip the following year. ''Pesni'' was the first poetry collection published in the [[Macedonian language]] in SR Macedonia after the war.

Šopov was member of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts (1967) and corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (1968).

He graduated from the philosophy department of the [[University in Skopje]] and the Higher Political School in [[Belgrade]]. He was president of the Translators’ Union and the Writers’ Union of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia in the 1950s and 1960s, and of the Writers’ Union of Yugoslavia from 1965 to 1969. From 1970 to 1977 he was a diplomat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Aco+%C5%A0opov Free dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Ацо Шопов споменик Скопје - Aco Šopov monument Skopje 01.JPG|thumb|mini|right|Monument of Aco Šopov. Bridge of Arts, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia]]
His childhood was haunted by the specter of incurable disease, death, sadness, and loneliness - themes that would later permeate his poetry.  He referred to his youth as the "Hundred-headed monster." When he was just eleven years old, his mother, whom he had cared for alone, died prematurely of a serious illness .&lt;ref&gt;Šopova Jasmina: ''Po-tragite na Aco Šopov'', Skopje, Sigmapres, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He began writing poetry in a school notebook at the age of fourteen.

In 1943, at the age of 19, Aco Šopov became engaged in the [[Yugoslav Partisans]]' resistance to the Nazi occupying forces.  He continued writing poetry during this period and found his subject matter in his own experience. He proved to be a highly personal poet even when chronicling events of a social or patriotic nature, as when describing the death of a much-loved woman and fellow partisan, [[Vera Jocić]].

With his poetry book ''Stihovi na makata i radosta'' (Verses of Suffering and Joy), Šopov moved away from [[socialist realism]].  Because of this departure in the early 1950s, Šopov's poetry was initially criticized but came to be recognized several years later.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Speaking with his own voice, Šopov charted his own course in poetry,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/aco-sopov-dlb/ Dictionary of Literary Biography on Aco Šopov]&lt;/ref&gt; without being a dissident. "The greatest challenge and the greatest moral responsibility of the poet," he said in an interview, "is to find the right words to the contents and ideas he wants to express in an authentic and inimitable way. If it fails, the poem is pulled out of its socket, the word becomes a lie."

In 1967, Aco Šopov became one of the founding members of the [[Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], and was awarded with the [[AVNOJ]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Aco Šopov (1923–1982): Festschrift presented as a memorial to Aco Šopov : a member of Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts&lt;/ref&gt; The AVNOJ Prize is the highest recognition in the area of science and art in the frames of the former Yugoslavia.

==Public career==
In 1971, after many years of journalism and publishing, Aco Šopov was nominated as the Yugoslav Ambassador to [[Senegal]]. Šopov's time in Senegal inspired the book ''Poem for the black women'', which won the [[Miladinov Brothers]] Prize&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strugapoetryevenings.com/poets/aco-shopov/?lang=en Aco Šopov awarded with the Miladinov Brothers Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Struga Poetry Evenings]] in 1976. This international festival, held each year in the South of Macedonia, was founded in 1961 by Šopov himself with a group of Macedonian poets.

In 1975, back from Senegal, Aco Šopov was appointed as President of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries of the Republic of Macedonia. However, just three years later, the disease foreshadowed in his poems forced him to retire from active life. Following a long illness, he died on 20 April 1982 in Skopje.

[[File:Axis of Evil map.svg|400px|thumb|Bush's "axis of evil" comprised [[Iran]], [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], and [[North Korea]] (red). "Beyond the Axis of Evil" comprised [[Cuba]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|Libya]], and [[Syria]] (orange). The [[United States]] is blue.]]

The phrase "'''axis of evil'''" was first used by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] in his [[State of the Union address]] on January 29, 2002, and often repeated throughout [[Presidency of George W. Bush|his presidency]], to describe foreign governments that, during his administration, [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|sponsored terrorism]] and sought [[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]. The notion of such an axis was used to pinpoint these common enemies of the United States and rally the American populace in support of the [[War on Terror]].

==2002 State of the Union==
In his [[2002 State of the Union Address]], Bush called [[North Korea]] "A regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while [[North Korean famine|starving its citizens]]."&lt;ref name=suterror&gt;{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/detail/4540 |title=State of the Union Address (January 29, 2002) |work=millercenter.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011053416/http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/detail/4540 |archivedate=October 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated [[Iran]] "aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an [[Supreme Leader of Iran|unelected]] [[Guardian Council|few]] repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom."&lt;ref name=suterror /&gt; Of the three nations Bush cited, however, he gave the most criticism to [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]].&lt;ref name=suterror /&gt; He stated "Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop [[anthrax]] and [[nerve gas]] and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has [[Halabja chemical attack|already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens]], leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world."&lt;ref name=suterror /&gt; Afterwards, Bush said, "States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world."&lt;ref name=suterror /&gt;

===David Frum===
The phrase was attributed to former Bush speechwriter [[David Frum]], originally as the ''axis of hatred'' and then ''evil''. Frum explained his rationale for creating the phrase ''axis of evil'' in his book ''The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush''. Essentially, the story begins in late December 2001 when head speechwriter [[Michael Gerson]] gave Frum the assignment of articulating the case for dislodging the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] in Iraq in only a few sentences for the upcoming State of the Union address. Frum says he began by rereading President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Infamy Speech|"date which will live in infamy"]] speech given on December 8, 1941, after the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. While Americans needed no convincing about going to war with Japan, Roosevelt saw the greater threat to the United States coming from [[Nazi Germany]], and he had to make the case for fighting a two-ocean war.

Frum points in his book to a now often-overlooked sentence in Roosevelt's speech which reads in part, "...we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger us again." Frum interprets Roosevelt's oratory like this: "For FDR, Pearl Harbor was not only an attack—it was a warning of future and worse attacks from another, even more dangerous enemy." Japan, a country with one-tenth of America's industrial capacity, a dependence on imports for its food, and already engaged in a war with [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]], was extremely reckless to attack the United States, a recklessness "that made the Axis such a menace to world peace", Frum says. Saddam Hussein's two wars, against Iran and Kuwait, were just as reckless, Frum decided, and therefore presented the same threat to world peace.

In his book Frum relates that the more he compared the [[Axis powers of World War II]] to modern "terror states", the more similarities he saw. "The Axis powers disliked and distrusted one another", Frum writes. "Had the Axis somehow won the war, its members would quickly have turned on one another." Iran, Iraq, [[al-Qaeda]], and [[Hezbollah]], despite quarreling among themselves, "all resented power of the West and Israel, and they all despised the humane values of democracy." There, Frum saw the connection: "Together, the terror states and the terror organizations formed an axis of hatred against the United States."

Frum tells that he then sent off a memo with the above arguments and also cited some of the atrocities perpetrated by the Iraqi government. He expected his words to be chopped apart and altered beyond recognition, as is the fate of much presidential speechwriting, but his words were ultimately read by Bush nearly verbatim, though Bush changed the term ''axis of hatred'' to ''axis of evil''. North Korea was added to the list, he says, because it was attempting to develop nuclear weapons, had a history of reckless aggression, and "needed to feel a stronger hand".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2076552/ "Axis of Evil" Authorship Settled! It was Frum and Gerson, and definitely not Bush.] January 9, 2003. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206045806/http://www.slate.com/id/2076552/|date=February 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, Frum's wife disclosed his authorship to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/bush/story/0,7369,658724,00.html "Proud wife turns 'axis of evil' speech into a resignation letter"], Matthew Engel, ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 27, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yossef Bodansky===
A decade before the 2002 State of the Union address, in August 1992, the Israeli-American political scientist [[Yossef Bodansky]] wrote a paper entitled "[[Tehran]], [[Baghdad]] &amp; [[Damascus]]: The New Axis Pact"&lt;ref name="horrigan-august"&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bod4.htm|author=Yossef Bodansky &amp; Vaughn S. Forrest on behalf of the House Republican Research Committee|title=Tehran, Baghdad &amp; Damascus: The New Axis Pact|date=1992-08-10|accessdate=2007-05-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070610160021/https://fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bod4.htm| archivedate= June 10, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while serving as the Director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare of the [[US House of Representatives]]. Although he did not explicitly apply the epithet ''evil'' to his New Axis, Bodansky's axis was otherwise very reminiscent of Frum's axis. Bodansky felt that this new Axis was a very dangerous development. The gist of Bodansky's argument was that Iran, Iraq and Syria had formed a "tripartite alliance" in the wake of the [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]], and that this alliance posed an imminent threat that could only be dealt with by invading Iraq a second time and overthrowing [[Saddam Hussein]].

==={{anchor|Beyond the Axis of Evil}} Bolton: "Beyond the Axis of Evil"===
[[File:John R. Bolton.png|thumb|[[John R. Bolton]]]]
On May 6, 2002, then-Undersecretary of State [[John R. Bolton]] gave a speech entitled "Beyond the Axis of Evil". In it he added three more nations to be grouped with the already mentioned [[rogue state]]s: [[Cuba]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|Libya]], and [[Syria]]. The criteria for inclusion in this grouping were: "[[state sponsors of terrorism]] that are pursuing or who have the potential to pursue [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) or have the capability to do so in violation of their treaty obligations."&lt;ref name="bolton-beyond"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/beyond-the-axis-of-evil|author=John R. Bolton|title=Beyond the Axis of Evil: Additional Threats from Weapons of Mass Destruction|date=2002-05-06|accessdate=2015-09-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924220446/http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/beyond-the-axis-of-evil|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Iran and Iraq fought the long [[Iran–Iraq War]] in the 1980s under basically the same leadership as that which existed at the time of Bush's speech, leading some to believe that the linking of the nations under the same banner was misguided. Others argued that each of the three nations in the "axis of evil" had some special characteristics which were obscured by grouping them together. [[Anne Applebaum]] wrote about the debate over North Korea's inclusion in the group.&lt;ref name="slate-2002"&gt;{{cite web|title=North Korea: Threat or Menace?|author=Anne Applebaum|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2061973/|publisher=Slate|date=2002-02-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525194445/http://www.slate.com/id/2061973/|archivedate=May 25, 2007|accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days after the [[9/11 attacks]], Ryan Crocker, the American Ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009 (then a senior State Department official), and other senior U.S. State Department officials flew to [[Geneva]] to meet secretly with representatives of the government of Iran. For several months, Crocker and his Iranian counterparts cooperated on capturing [[Al Qaeda]] operatives in the region and fighting the [[Taliban]] government in Afghanistan. These meetings stopped after the "Axis of Evil" speech hardened Iranian attitudes toward cooperating with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/09/30/130930fa_fact_filkins|title=Dexter Filkins: Qassem Suleimani, the Middle East's Most Powerful Operative|author=Dexter Filkins|date=September 30, 2013|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=December 18, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125090341/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/09/30/130930fa_fact_filkins|archivedate=January 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other axes==
In January 2006, Israeli Defense Minister [[Shaul Mofaz]] implicated "the axis of terror that operates between Iran and Syria" following a suicide bomb in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name="bbc2006-01-20"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4630650.stm|title=Israel attacks 'axis of terror'|date=20 January 2006|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013061111/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4630650.stm|archive-date=13 October 2013|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006 the phrase ''axis of terror'' earned more publicity. Israel's UN Ambassador, [[Dan Gillerman]], cautioned of a new ''axis of terror''—Iran, Syria and the [[Hamas]]-run Palestinian government; Gillerman repeated the term before the UN over the crisis in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gillerman fingers 'axis of terror' |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1139395462436 |publisher=Jerusalem Post |date=2006-02-22 |accessdate=2007-11-28 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some three months later Israeli senior foreign ministry official Gideon Meir branded the alleged alliance an ''axis of terror and hate''.&lt;ref name="gulf-times-2006-07-14"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=97233&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=37&amp;parent_id=17|title=Israel blames Iran and Syria for violence|date=14 July 2006|work=Gulf Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201619/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=97233&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=37&amp;parent_id=17|archivedate=September 30, 2007|accessdate=22 May 2007|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Isaias Afewerki]], the president of Eritrea, had declared in response to the deteriorating relations with the neighboring countries of Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen by accusing them of being an "Axis of Belligerence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=parade-magazine-2007-02-17&gt; |url=http://www.parade.com/articles/web_exclusives/2007/02-11-2007/dictators13.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202115614/http://www.parade.com/articles/web_exclusives/2007/02-11-2007/dictators13.html |archivedate=December 2, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[president of Venezuela]], [[Hugo Chávez]], described the so-called [[Pink tide|New Latin Left]] as an "axis of good" comprising Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela and instead "Washington and its allies" as an "axis of evil".&lt;ref name="evomorales"&gt;{{cite web|title=Evo Morales hace amigos|author=Alba Gil|url=http://www.americaeconomica.com/numeros4/352/reportajes%5CAlba352.htm|website=AmericaEconomica.com|date=2006-01-05|accessdate=2007-05-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409170257/http://www.americaeconomica.com/numeros4/352/reportajes/Alba352.htm|archivedate=April 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''[[The Economist]]'' featured an article about the "Axis of Diesel" in reference to a burgeoning alliance of Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. They cite the billions of dollars in arms sales to Venezuela and the construction of Iranian nuclear facilities as well as the rejection of added sanctions on Iran. They did conclude that the benefits of the arrangement were exaggerated, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12480942 | work=The Economist | title=An axis in need of oiling | date=2008-10-23 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026024742/http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12480942 | archivedate=October 26, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 onward, the term "[[Axis of Resistance]]" has been used to describe an [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] and [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Israeli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9459321/Syria-Iran-vows-it-will-not-allow-Assad-to-fall.html|title=Syria: Iran vows it will not allow Assad to fall|date=12 July 2012|accessdate=8 August 2012|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political alliance|alliance]] between [[Iran]], [[Syria]], [[Hezbollah]], [[Iraqi Shia militia]]s, and the [[Houthis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/08/07/syria-crisis-idINL6E8J6E9Q20120807/|title=Iran backs Assad as Syrian forces choke off Aleppo|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=7 August 2012|work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/07/world/meast/syria-unrest/|title=Iran: Syria part of 'axis of resistance'|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=7 August 2012|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, geo-strategist and author, [[William C. Martel]], in a short essay for the publication, [[The Diplomat]], wrote of an "Authoritarian Axis", comprising China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Syria &amp; Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/06/an-authoritarian-axis-rising/|title=An Authoritarian Axis Rising?|author=William C.

Martel's thesis drew criticism from several quarters, with the main arguments cited in opposition to his idea being the lack of cohesion and generally low levels of cooperation shown between the cited countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/the-authoritarian-axis-that-doesnt-exist/|title=The "Authoritarian Axis" That Doesn't Exist|work=The American Conservative|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918002356/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/the-authoritarian-axis-that-doesnt-exist/|archivedate=September 18, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/the-return-of-the-authoritarian-axis-that-doesnt-exist/|title=The Return of the "Authoritarian Axis" That Doesn't Exist|work=The American Conservative|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909152434/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/the-return-of-the-authoritarian-axis-that-doesnt-exist/|archivedate=September 9, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://muslimvillage.com/2012/07/04/24781/there-is-no-cabal-the-authoritarian-axis-nonsense/|title=There is no cabal: The "Authoritarian Axis" nonsense|date=July 4, 2012|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420050013/https://muslimvillage.com/2012/07/04/24781/there-is-no-cabal-the-authoritarian-axis-nonsense/|archivedate=April 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a March 2018 interview with the Egyptian media, [[Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Crown Prince]] [[Mohammad bin Salman]] referred [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] and Islamist organizations such as [[ISIL]] and the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] as the "triangle of evil", to describe their current policies in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/state-visit-to-britain-by-saudi-leader-fails-to-sway-critics-1.3423270|first=Michael|last=Jansen|title=State visit to Britain by Saudi leader fails to sway critics|date=March 11, 2018|work=Irish Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204823/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/state-visit-to-britain-by-saudi-leader-fails-to-sway-critics-1.3423270|archivedate=March 12, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those remarks were later dismissed by Iran, describing it as "childish" and said that Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen has "caused instability and extremism and stuck in a quagmire" in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/03/iran-mbs-egypt-visit-triangle-evil-salman-reaction-turkey.html|title=Iran dismisses Saudi talk of 'triangle of evil' as 'childish'|author=Al-Monitor Staff|date=March 8, 2018|work=[[Al-Monitor]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311231041/https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/03/iran-mbs-egypt-visit-triangle-evil-salman-reaction-turkey.html|archivedate=March 11, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit with host [[Jonny Moseley]], George W. Bush played by [[Will Ferrell]] expands the "Axis of Evil" (although he doesn't mention North Korea, instead saying "one of the Koreas") to include things with "evil" in it or things he does not understand (including [[Enron]], [[Tom Daschle]], the [[Economy of the United States|economy]], France, those who [[Don't Mess with Texas|"mess with Texas"]], the [[Axis powers|"original Axis of Evil"]], [[mathematics]], [[Dick Cheney]] (for now), and [[Evel Knievel]], with the exception of [[Dr. Evil]]). Ferrell mispronounces "axis" so it sound like "Access of Evil".

* ''[[The Economist]]'' ran a 2006 (May 13–19) cover headline titled "Axis of Feeble" about the end of the George Bush-[[Tony Blair]] partnership.&lt;ref name="economist-2006-05-11"&gt;{{cite news|title=George Bush and Tony Blair: The end of a Bush-Blair era|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6916012|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2006-05-11|accessdate=2007-05-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070407012615/http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6916012| archivedate= April 7, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bill Bailey===
British Comedian [[Bill Bailey]] also referred to the Axis of Evil in his [[Part Troll]] tour. He queried whether it was possible to assume a non-evil role within a terrorist organisation, possibly in the laundry or catering department. He then went on to pretend that he was the receptionist for the Axis of Evil. Imagining he was answering the phone, Bill Bailey says to the audience, "Hello, Axis of Evil. Oh no, they're all out at the moment. Oh, I don't know. Doing something evil I suppose". Placing the "caller" on hold, he then played a short [[jingle]] for the "Axis of Evil Pension Scheme".

===Comedy Tour===
In response to the problems Americans of Middle-Eastern descent have in the current climate, a group of comedians have banded together to form the ''[[Axis of Evil Comedy Tour]]''. The comedians, [[Ahmed Ahmed]] (from Egypt), [[Maz Jobrani]] (from Iran), and [[Aron Kader]] (whose father is [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]]), have created a show which aired on [[Comedy Central]]. They have also included half-Palestinian, half-Italian [[Dean Obeidallah]] in some of their acts.

The group took the comedy tour around the Middle East (November - December 2007), performing in the UAE, Egypt, Kuwait, Jordan, and Lebanon to sell-out crowds.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Lullabies===
In 2003 the Norwegian record label [[Kirkelig Kulturverksted]] published the CD ''[[Lullabies from the Axis of Evil]]'' containing 14 lullabies from Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Palestine, Syria, Afghanistan and Cuba. Every lullaby is presented in its original form sung by women from these countries, and then a western version with interpretations in English.&lt;ref name="kirkelig"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elance.no/kkv/asp/hoved.asp?show=musikk_eng |author=Erik Hillestad |publisher=Kirkelig Kulturverksted |title=? |accessdate=2007-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525164349/http://www.elance.no/kkv/asp/hoved.asp?show=musikk_eng |archivedate=May 25, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Braničevci''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Браничевци}}) was an early medieval Slavic tribe that inhabited the region of [[Braničevo (region)|Braničevo]], in what is today [[Serbia]], in the early 9th century. Their ethnonym is Slavic, derived from ''braniti se'' ("to defend"); [[Proto-Slavic]] *''borniti'', related to ''bòriti se'' ("to fight, struggle"). [[Al Masudi]] mentions them as ''Branicabin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biblioteka Przegl̨adu zachodniego|issue=3-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSQ7AQAAIAAJ|year=1948|publisher=Instytut Zachodni|page=113|quote=M a s u d i'm: streszczanie, opuszczanie lazw (Noe, imiona książąt, plemiona: Manabin i Branicabin) i ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdo Šišić]] called the Braničevci and [[Timočani]] "Dacian-Slavic tribes" (dačko-slovenska plemena).

'''Charles Monnard''' (17 January 1790, in [[Bern]] &amp;ndash; 13 January 1865, in [[Bonn]]) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[historian]].

He studied theology in [[Lausanne]], and from 1813 to 1816, worked as a tutor in Paris. From 1816 to 1845 he was a professor of [[French literature]] at the [[University of Lausanne|Academy of Lausanne]]. In 1847 he attained the chair of literature and [[Romance languages]] at the [[University of Bonn]], a position he maintained up until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F4812.php Monnard, Charles] Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse&lt;/ref&gt; 

He expanded to [[Romandy]] the [[Historiography_of_Switzerland#Building_a_national_history|national-historical movement in Swiss history]] that had been promoted by German-speaking Swiss historians such as [[Johannes von Müller]] and [[Heinrich Zschokke]]. He translated both men's works into French, and was one of several historians to work on a continuation of von Müller's ''Geschichten Schweizerischer Eidgenossenschaft''. This work fit into the context of Monnard's liberal politics in the [[Restoration and Regeneration (Switzerland)|controversies of the time]], opposing the attempts of the old elites to reestablish themselves.

Monnard was also a founding member of the [[Société d'histoire de la Suisse romande]], and a member of the [[Helvetic Society]] after it was revived in 1819.

'''Circa''' ({{ety|la||around, about}}) - frequently abbreviated '''c.''', '''ca.''', or '''ca''' (and less frequently '''circ.''' or '''cca.''') – signifies "approximately" in several European languages (and as a [[loanword]] in English), usually in reference to a date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/circa |title=circa |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]] |access-date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Circa'' is widely used in historical writing when the dates of events are not accurately known.

When used in date ranges, ''circa'' is applied before each approximate date, while dates without ''circa'' immediately preceding them are generally assumed to be known with certainty.
Example: [[George Washington]] years are:
* 1732–1799 or 1732–99: Both years are known precisely.
* {{circa|lk=no|1732}} – 1799: Only the end year is known accurately; the start year is approximate.
* 1732 – {{circa|lk=no|1799}}: Only the start year is known accurately; the end year is approximate.
* {{circa|lk=no|1732|1799}}: Both years are approximate.

The '''Friends of the Uffizi Gallery''' was established in 2006 in [[Palm Beach, Florida]] as the United States "sister" organization to the Amici degli Uffizi in [[Florence, Italy]], which was founded by a group of concerned citizens in response to the terrorist bombing of the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in May 1993 that damaged several artworks and portions of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cowell|first=Alan|title=Bomb Outside Uffizi in Florence Kills 6 and Damages Many Works|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/world/bomb-outside-uffizi-in-florence-kills-6-and-damages-many-works.html|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 28, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi directly support the Uffizi Gallery by helping build awareness of the museum and its [[cultural heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Cultural Heritage|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/unesco-database-of-national-cultural-heritage-laws/frequently-asked-questions/definition-of-the-cultural-heritage/|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by raising funds for acquisitions, preservation, restorations, temporary exhibitions, and educational programming.

== History ==
[[File:Uffizi Gallery from south 2013 February.jpg|thumb|250px|Uffizi Gallery viewed from the south]]

In 1993 a terrorist bomb severely damaged the [[Uffizi Gallery]] and some of the artworks.&lt;ref name=Olive&gt;{{cite news|last=Pirro|first=Deirdre|title=The Olive Tree of Peace: The massacre in via dei Georgofili|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=7762|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=The Florentine|date=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to this attack, a group of concerned citizens founded the Amici degli Uffizi in Florence to help restore and preserve the artistic heritage of the museum. Since the bombing, the Amici degli Uffizi has supported the Uffizi Gallery by facilitating acquisitions, supporting restorations, and organizing special temporary exhibitions.

In 2006, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery, Inc. was established in Palm Beach, Florida as the United States “sister” organization to the Amici degli Uffizi. Granted 501(c)(3) Tax Exempt Status, its sole purpose is to support the activities of the Amici by helping to fund ongoing restoration projects and to bring these projects to fruition.

Led by Executive Board President Contessa Maria Vittoria Colonna Rimbotti, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery in conjunction with the Amici degli Uffizi raises funds to support all of these activities through an international group of members and patrons. More than 30 restoration projects designated as priorities by the museum have been completed over the last several years and include renowned paintings, altarpieces, sculptures and tapestries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Completed Restoration Projects|url=http://www.friendsoftheuffizigallery.org/completed-restoration-projects/|publisher=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The mission of both organizations is to support the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy, by raising awareness of the museum and its collections and by providing resources for acquisition, preservation, restoration and education.

=== Friends of the Uffizi Gallery Symbol ===
Created by Sergio Bianco, the symbol represents the view of the Uffizi from the Arno arcade. The sky seen under the archway forms the shape of a horse head in the typical posture of the knight chess piece. Representing loyalty and the right cause, the horse symbolizes the commitment of the Associations Amici degli Uffizi and Friends of the Uffizi Gallery to the benefit of the Uffizi Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery Symbol|url=http://www.sergiobianco.it/basement.asp?sn=&amp;sez=1&amp;sez1=1&amp;area=&amp;lang=en&amp;nome=&amp;lay=articolo&amp;pag=69|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities and special events ==

===Florentine weekend, Florence Italy===
Every two years, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery organize the Florentine Weekend, which includes art-focused activities at the Uffizi Gallery and in nearby locations throughout the City of Florence that relate to both Renaissance art and Italian culture. It is a members-only event open to Friends of the Uffizi Gallery members at the Botticelli, Michelangelo and Leonardo membership levels.

== Completed restoration projects ==
[[File:Michelangelo- Tondo Doni - tone corrected.jpg|thumb|Michelangelo's ''Tondo Doni'' is the centerpiece of the new room reconstructed through funds from the Friends of Uffizi Gallery]]
More than thirty restorations designated as a priority by the Uffizi Gallery have been completed with funds raised by both Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and Amici degli Uffizi.

The '''Michelangelo Room''', which opened to the public on January 29, 2013, is an example of a completed project by this organization.  The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi funded the re-construction of this room on the second floor and the re-installation of the paintings. The re-construction involved restoring the original marble floor and re-plastering the walls and painting them red. 
The re-installation included Michelangelo’s ''[[Doni Tondo|Tondo Doni]]'' (ca. 1507 oil and tempera on panel) which is the only confirmed panel painting existing today in its original frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery fund new Michelangelo Room on second floor of gallery in Italy|url=http://artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=60758#.U15_RF7Zdg0|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Art Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other early sixteenth-century Florentine painters represented in the room include [[Francesco Granacci]], [[Fra Bartolomeo]] (Paolo di Jacopo del Fattorino detto Baccio della Porta), [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Franciabigio]], [[Giuliano Bugiardini]],  and [[Alonso Berruguete]].

'''''[[Laocoön]]''''' by [[Baccio Bandinelli]] (Firenze 1493-1560), depicts the Trojan priest Laocoön and his two sons ensnared in the toils of the sea serpents sent by [[Poseidon]]. A previous restoration was done when the sculpture was broken into more than 40 pieces by a fire that caused a partial roof collapse at the Uffizi on August 12, 1762. The new restoration improved on the previous one plus removed layers of dust and wax that had built up over the decades and caused the sculpture’s surface to become dull and darkened. This restoration will protect the beauty and condition of this sculpture for many generations.

== Individual restoration projects ==
These two projects are examples of restorations funded by a single Leonardo-level member of the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery.

The restoration of this late 2nd Century A.D. replica of a 5th Century B.C. Greek sculpture of '''''[[Asclepius]]''''', the god of medicine, made it possible to confirm the pertinence of the head to the body. In addition to strengthening the sculpture by replacing old putty, recent cleaning of the surface revealed details from an early 12th Century restoration such as the figure’s left hand holding a medicinal plant well known since the Middle Ages. This restoration was funded by the Lisa Marie Conte Browne Family.

This mid-2nd Century A.D. statue of '''''[[Aphrodite]] &amp; [[Eros]]''''' is a replica of the original Capitoline Venus, apart from the addition of the small funerary Eros. The sculpture’s head, arms and right leg were integrated in 1584. The sculpture is likely to have never been restored since then and the recent restoration included removing the dirt deposits and addressing the ancient integrations and fractures repairs. This restoration was funded by Thomas J. and Judith A. Embrescia.

== Community restoration projects ==
With this type of project, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery accepts donations from all sources (including non-members) interested in conserving a selected work of art.

The 2014 project is a statue of '''''[[Aphrodite]]''''' (2nd Century AD). She is the Greek goddess of love, known as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] to the Romans. This sculpture is a standing semi-nude female figure created using the ancient Roman fragments of the torso and head. The arms aned richly-draped lower part were added by [[Alessandro Algardi]], an artist hired by the Medici in the 17th Century to integrate the fragments into a single sculpture. This restoration project involved removing thick layers of accumulated dust and greatly increased documentary information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1629">'''Gao Lingwen''' (1862–1945) was a famous scholar and writer from the city of [[Tianjin]] (Tientsin), [[China]]. He was the founder and principal of the first modern high school of Tianjin, the ''Bell Tower Middle School'' (铃铛阁中学), and the elder brother of China's acting President [[Gao Lingwei]], of the [[Beiyang Government]].

After the fall of Tianjin in 1900, Gao decided to create middle schools in Tianjin, to enlighten the general population and save them from the demise of ignorance. In 1901, he opened a private school at the Northwest Corner (西北角) of Tianjin, named the ''General School'' (普通学堂). He hired both Chinese and English-speaking teachers, and the school received about 100 students. In 1902, the ''General School'' was declared Tianjin's first public school, and changed its name to the ''Bell Tower Middle School''. Afterwards, he also opened five elementary schools, and three lecturing houses. In 1906, rewarding him for his enormous efforts in his educational career, he was promoted to be the general manager of the Department of Education.

During 1915 to 1922, Gao was devoted to the documentation of Tianjin's history, writing ''The New Record of Tianjin County'' (天津县新志).

Count '''Giammaria Mazzuchelli''' (or Giovanni Maria Mazzucchelli) (28 November 1707 – 19 November 1765) was an Italian writer, [[bibliographer]] and historian.

==Biography==

Mazzuchelli was the son of Count Federico Mazzuchelli (Brescia, 1671–1746) and Margaret Muzzi. Due to poor health during early childhood, he studied at first with a private tutor. He continued his studies in [[Bologna]], where he studied under [[Francesco Saverio Quadrio]], and later in [[Padua]], where he studied under Domenico Lazzarini, where he graduated in 1728. In the same year, he married Barbara Chizzoli, an heiress whose dowry allowed him to devote himself to historical studies. Mazzucchelli's father bought the Moggi's sixteenth-century family house,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museimazzucchelli.it/en/giammaria-mazzucchelli-museum-villa/cp-10.aspx Mazzucchelli Villa Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; located between Brescia and [[Lake Garda]], in 1722, and added the central building and the west wing some time later. Giammaria completed the construction in 1753, as stated on the memorial tablet set between the pronaos' central door architrave and the tympanum.

He began with numerous scholarly and accurate biographies of ancient and more modern authors, e.g., [[Archimedes]], [[Pietro Aretino]],&lt;ref&gt;Giammaria Mazzuchelli, Pietro Aretino's life written by Count Giammaria Mazzuchelli Brescia, Padova, following Giuseppe Comino , 1741&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giammaria Mazzuchelli, Pietro Aretino's life written by Count Giammaria Mazzuchelli Brescia, decorated with seven tables , Milan, and Francesco Sonzogno Comp Contrada della Spiga, P.

From this experience, he conceived an ambitious plan to collect biographies of all the writers of Italy from the earliest times, including the history of their works. In this endeavor, he relied on the [[Queriniana library]] in Brescia, donated by the Cardinal [[Angelo Maria Quirini]], and his extensive correspondence with the scholars of Italy and Europe. He began to compile a dictionary of great writers of Italy, but the work remained unfinished because of his untimely death.&lt;ref&gt;Giammaria Mazzuchelli, Writers of Italy, that is, historical news and criticism about the lives and writings of the Italian literati, Brescia, Bossini, 1753–1763.. Vol I, Part 1 , Vol I, Part 2 , Vol II, Part 1 , Vol II, Part 2 , Vol II, Part 3 Vol II Part 4&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mazzuchelli opened the way to the history of Italian literature, recognized by Girolamo Tiraboschi in the Introduction of his greatest work,&lt;ref&gt;Girolamo Tiraboschi, History of Italian Literature by Girolamo Tiraboschi, the Society of Jesus, librarian of the Most Serene Duke of Modena, Modena, at the printing company, 1772–1782.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent historians. Much of Mazzuchelli's unpublished material is still in manuscript form in the Vatican Library. A copy is also in the collection of the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Roma.

}}'''Haarlem Mill''', on the [[River Ecclesbourne]] in [[Wirksworth]], [[Derbyshire]], was an early [[cotton mill]]. Built by [[Richard Arkwright]], it was the first cotton mill in the world to use a [[steam engine]], though this was used to supplement the supply of water to the mill's [[water wheel]], not to drive the machinery directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitton|1989|p=57}}; {{Harvnb|Tann|1979|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of the mill, including an older [[corn mill]], was leased by Arkwright in 1777. Construction of the mill building in brick and stone was completed by June 1780, and the reported death of a young man attempting to climb on the water wheel suggests that it was operational at this date.&lt;ref name="fittonp57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitton|1989|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially investigating the purchase of a steam engine from the [[Birmingham]] firm of [[Boulton and Watt]],&lt;ref name="Tannp248"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tann|1979|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkwright installed a [[reciprocating steam engine]], probably manufactured by [[Francis Thompson (engineer)|Francis Thompson]] of [[Ashover]], to supplement the occasionally inadequate water supply.&lt;ref name="fittonp57" /&gt; This was a medium-sized engine with a {{convert|26|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} beam, an {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[flywheel]]&lt;ref name="fittonp57" /&gt; a {{convert|30|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} cylinder and a stroke of {{convert|5|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Tannp248" /&gt; Similar to engines commonly used at the time to pump out nearby [[Mining|mines]], it operated 24 hours a day, powering two pumps.&lt;ref name="Tannp248" /&gt;

By 1789 the mill was employing almost 200 people, but it was sold by Arkwright three years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitton|1989|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base of the original building survives, but the upper three floors have since been rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|contribution=Haarlem Mill|contribution-url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=79712|title=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government also operates related programs for the recognition of historic persons ([[Persons of National Historic Significance|National Historic Persons]]) and events ([[Events of National Historic Significance (Canada)|National Historic Events]]).

==Provinces==
[[File:Provincial historic resource of Alberta plaque.JPG|thumb|This [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] indicates that the building is protected by the [[Government of Alberta]]]]
Each provincial government has distinct systems and approaches to heritage conservation.  They may delegate the authority to preserve historic buildings to municipalities, and / or have a provincial [[heritage register]].

For example, in the province of [[Alberta]], only sites owned by the provincial government and run as a functioning historic site or museum are known as [[Provincial historic sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Sites or Provincial Historic Areas]].  Buildings and sites owned by [[privately owned|private citizens and companies]] or [[Canadian federalism|other levels or branches of government]] may gain one of two levels of historic designation, "Registered Historic Resource" or "Provincial Historic Resource".&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/designation/default.aspx Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Alberta's Historic Places Designation Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Historic designation in Alberta is governed by the Historic Resources Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qp.gov.ab.ca/Documents/acts/H09.CFM Alberta Queen's Printer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The province also lists buildings deemed historically significant by municipal governments on the Alberta Register of Historic Places, which is also part of the larger [[Canadian Register of Historic Places]] although this does not imply provincial or federal government status or protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/designation/municipal.aspx Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Alberta's Historic Places Designation Program - Municipal Historic Resource Designation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205022849/http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/designation/municipal.aspx |date=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To supplement this system, the province also run the Alberta Main Street Program  which helps to preserve historic buildings in the [[downtown]]s of [[List of communities in Alberta|smaller communities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertamainstreet.org/ The Alberta Main Street Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623100324/http://albertamainstreet.org/ |date=2011-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The basis for the preservation system in Alberta is the Heritage Survey Program, which is a survey of 80,000 historic buildings in Alberta which lack a protected status but are documented for possible future protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/heritagesurveyprogram.aspx Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Heritage Survey Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164327/http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/heritagesurveyprogram.aspx |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Quebec]], the [[Répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec]] is the main heritage register, it includes both protected and unprotected properties.  The [[Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Québec]] is a non-profit organization created in 1995 to promote the conservation of churches and other religious heritage buildings in the province.&lt;ref name="patrimoine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patrimoine-religieux.qc.ca/en/organisme/mission.php|title=Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Québec|accessdate=2009-03-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621103711/http://www.patrimoine-religieux.qc.ca/en/organisme/mission.php|archivedate=2008-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipalities==
Cities, towns, counties and other [[local government in Canada]] may use [[zoning]] and other [[bylaws]] to restrict the demolition of individual historic buildings or districts.  They may maintain a municipal heritage register, such as [[Edmonton]]'s "Register of Historic Resources in Edmonton".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonton.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_284_220_0_43/http%3B/CMSServer/COEWeb/infrastructure+planning+and+building/Historic+Resources/ City of Edmonton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Vancouver]] uses a traditional heritage register&lt;ref&gt;[http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/planning/heritage/Fact8.htm Vancouver.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; and a new system called a [[density bank]], under which developers are rewarded for preserving and restoring heritage buildings by being awarded exceptions to restrictions (usually height restrictions) on other sites they own.&lt;ref&gt;http://cityhallwatch.wordpress.com/special-topics/density-bank-transfers-and-more/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montreal]], one of Canada's oldest and most historically rich cities, the [[Le Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal]] advises the municipal government on matters related to heritage building preservation.&lt;ref name="Conseil du patrimoine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=2981,3122714&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Le Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal|publisher=City of Montreal|accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of non-governmental groups have worked to preserve Montreal historic buildings since the 1970s: [[Save Montreal]], co-founded by [[Michael Fish (architect)|Michael Fish]] in 1974, and [[Heritage Montreal]], founded by [[Phyllis Lambert]] two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Gravenor, Kristian (October 23, 2003).

== Government approach to policy ==
Two of the primary conservation tools in Canada are the [[Canadian Register of Historic Places]] and the ''[[Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada]]''. This document  was the result of a major collaborative effort among federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, heritage conservation professionals, heritage developers and many individual Canadians.  A pan–Canadian collaboration, it is intended to reinforce the development of a culture of conservation in Canada, which will continue to find a unique expression in each of the jurisdictions and regions of the country.  In the document, conservation approaches are broken down into three categories: Preservation, Rehabilitation, and Restoration.  As published in the ''[[Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada]]'', these conservation approaches are defined as follows:&lt;ref name=terms&gt;[http://www.historicplaces.ca/nor-sta/request.aspx?page=sec2/page2b_e Standards and Guidelines - Definitions of Some Key Terms], ''Canada's Historic Places''. Retrieved 30 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Preservation:''' the action or process of protecting, maintaining, and/or stabilizing the existing materials, form, and integrity of a historic place or of an individual component, while protecting its heritage value. Preservation can include both short-term and interim measures to protect or stabilize the place, as well as long-term actions to retard deterioration or prevent damage so that the place can be kept serviceable through routine maintenance and minimal repair, rather than extensive replacement and new construction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Rehabilitation:''' the action or process of making possible a continuing or compatible contemporary use of a historic place or an individual component, through repair, alterations, and/ or additions, while protecting its heritage value.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Restoration:''' the action or process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a historic place or of an individual component, as it appeared at a particular period in its history, while protecting its heritage value.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''historic centre of Florence''' is part of [[quartiere]] 1 of the Italian city of [[Florence]]. This quarter was named a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1982.

Built on the site of an Etruscan settlement, Florence, the symbol of the Renaissance, rose to economic and cultural pre-eminence under the Medici in the 15th and 16th centuries. Its 600 years of extraordinary artistic activity can be seen above all in the 13th-century cathedral (Santa Maria del Fiore), the Church of Santa Croce, the Uffizi and the Pitti Palace, the work of great masters such as [[Giotto]], [[Brunelleschi]], [[Botticelli]] and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/174|title = Historic Centre of Florence|date = |accessdate = 18 September 2014|website = UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspect==
Closed inside the avenues traced on the old medieval walls, the '''historic centre of Florence''' collects the city's most important cultural heritage sites. Delimited by the 14th century wall circuit, built thanks to the economic and commercial power reached at the time, knew its maximum splendor in the following two centuries.

Spiritual center of the city is [[Piazza del Duomo, Florence|Piazza del Duomo]] with the [[Florence Cathedral|Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore]], flanked by [[Giotto's Campanile]] and facing the [[Florence Baptistry|Baptistry of Saint John]] with the 'Gates of Paradise' by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]. From here to the north there are the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] by [[Michelozzo]], the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|Basilica of Saint Lawrence]] by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], with the precious sacristies of [[Donatello]] and [[Michelangelo]]. Furthermore, the [[Museum of San Marco]] with masterpieces by [[Fra Angelico]], the [[Accademia Gallery]] which houses among other works the [[David (Michelangelo)|David]] by [[Michelangelo]] (1501–1504), and the [[Piazza della Santissima Annunziata]] with the [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Loggia of the Innocenti]] by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]].

Heading south from the '''Duomo''' there is the political and cultural center of Florence with [[Palazzo Vecchio]] and the [[Uffizi Gallery]] nearby, near which are the [[Bargello Museum]] and the [[Basilica of Santa Croce|Basilica of the Holy Cross]]. Crossing the [[Ponte Vecchio]] we arrive at the [[Oltrarno]] district with the [[Pitti Palace]] and the [[Boboli Gardens]]. Still in Oltrarno, there are the [[Santo Spirito, Florence|Basilica of the Holy Spirit]] by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and the [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence|Church of Santa Maria del Carmine]], with frescoes by [[Masolino]], [[Masaccio]] and [[Filippino Lippi]].

In the area west of the '''Duomo''' is situated the imposing palace [[Palazzo Strozzi]] (home of major exhibitions and cultural institutions) and the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella]], with the facade designed by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].

The old town can be appreciated in its entirety from the surrounding hills, especially from [[Forte Belvedere]], from the [[Piazzale Michelangelo]] with the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] Basilica of [[San Miniato al Monte]] and the hills of [[Fiesole]], which offers one of the most beautiful views of the [[Arno]] valley.

The northern part of the old town is surrounded by the avenues of [[Viali di Circonvallazione]], a series of large six-lane avenues inspired by Parisian boulevard created when Florence was the capital of Italy.

The center of Florence, with its hundreds of business activities is a paradise for shopping and entertainment: elegant boutiques, historic cafes, the lively street markets, as well as hosting numerous nightclubs, discos, American-bar and meeting places for a drink (the famous [[Negroni]] cocktail was born here).

==World Heritage Site==
In 1982 [[ICOMOS]] proposed the historic centre of Florence as a candidate World Heritage Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/174.pdf|title=Advisory Body Evaluation|accessdate = 18 September 2014|website = UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''History of the Mexicans as Told by Their Paintings''''' ({{lang-es|Historia de los Mexicanos por sus pinturas}}) is a [[Spanish language]], post-[[Spanish conquest of Mexico|conquest]] [[codex]] written in the 1530s. This manuscript was likely composed by Father [[Andrés de Olmos]], an early Franciscan friar.  It is presumed to be based upon one or more indigenous pictorial codices.

Henry Phillips Jr., a 19th-century historian, made a translation of the document in the 1880s and referred to it as the '''Codex Ramírez''', after Bishop [[Ramírez de Fuenleal]] who authorized its creation in 1532.

It is held in the library of the [[University of Texas at Austin]].

'''Homeland Security Grant Program''' (HSGP) is a program in the [[United States]] established in 2003 and was designated to incorporate all projects that provide funding to local, state, and Federal government agencies by the [[Department of Homeland Security]].&lt;ref name="fema"/&gt; The purpose of the grants is to purchase [[surveillance]] equipment, weapons, and advanced training for [[police|law enforcement]] personnel in order to heighten security.&lt;ref name="fema"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/government/grant/hsgp/index.shtm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217211817/http://www.fema.gov/government/grant/hsgp/index.shtm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-02-17 |title=FY 2009 Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) |work=FEMA Official Site |accessdate=2009-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dhs-grants"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xgovt/grants/|title=State Contacts &amp; Grant Award Information|work=Department of Homeland Security Official Site|accessdate=2009-03-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313025949/https://www.dhs.gov/xgovt/grants/|archivedate=2009-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HSGP helps fulfill one of the core missions of the Department of Homeland Security by enhancing the country's ability to prepare for, prevent, respond to and recover from potential attacks and other hazards. The HSGP is one of the main mechanisms in funding the creation and maintenance of national preparedness, which refers to the establishment of plans, procedures, policies, training, and equipment at the Federal, State, and local level that is needed to maximize the ability to prevent, respond to, and recover from major events such as terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=HSPD8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biometrics.gov/Documents/Homeland%20Security%20Presidential%20Directive%20_%20HSPD-8.pdf|title=Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-8|work=Government Biometrics Information Site|accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HSGP's creation stemmed from the consolidation of six original projects that were previously funded by the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness.&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, Jane. ''Introduction to Homeland Security'', p. 103. Butterworth-Heinemann, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The HSGP now encompasses five projects in the program: State Homeland Security Program, Urban Areas Security Initiative, Operation Stonegarden, Metropolitan Medical Response System Program, and Citizen Corps Program.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; During the 2010 fiscal year, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] will spend $1,786,359,956 on the Homeland Security Grant Program.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/txt/government/grant/2010/fy10_hsgp_faq.txt|title=Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)|work=FEMA Official Site|accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core program priorities==
As stated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, these four areas of mission-supporting responsibilities are what drive the Homeland Security Grant Program:
* Protecting the United States from terrorist threats is the founding principle and highest priority.&lt;ref name=HSGPGuide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/pdf/government/grant/2010/fy10_hsgp_kit.pdf|title=Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 Homeland Security Grant Program Guidance and Application Kit|work=FEMA Official Site|accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Securing the Nation’s southern and northern borders along with air and sea ports of entry.&lt;ref name=HSGPGuide/&gt;
* Facilitating legal immigration and naturalizing new Americans, while prosecuting those who violate the country's laws.&lt;ref name=HSGPGuide/&gt;
* Helping communities prepare, respond and recover from all facets of disaster.&lt;ref name=HSGPGuide/&gt;

==Current projects funded by the Homeland Security Grant Program==
The HSGP encompasses three projects with over $1 billion in funding available for FY 2017: the State Homeland Security Program ($402 million), the Urban Areas Security Initiative ($580 million), Operation Stonegarden ($55 million).&lt;ref name="FEMA"/&gt;{{fv|date=December 2017}} The HSGP previously included other projects, including the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program and Citizen Corps, but beginning in 2012, these projects were no longer part of the HSGP.&lt;ref name="FEMA"/&gt;{{fv|date=December 2017}}

===State Homeland Security Program (SHSP)===

===Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) Program===
In 2011, the Metropolitan Medical Response System program made $34.9 million available&lt;ref&gt;"FY 2011 Homeland Security Grant Program. ''FEMA''. 4 May 2017. Accessed 3 July 2017. &lt;https://www.fema.gov/fy-2011-homeland-security-grant-program&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for the integration of emergency management, health, and medical systems into an organized response to mass casualty incidents such as nuclear, biological or chemical terrorist incidents.&lt;ref name=MMRS&gt;Christen, Hank and Maniscalco, Paul.

''FEMA''. 4 May 2017. Accessed 3 July 2017. &lt;https://www.fema.gov/fy-2011-homeland-security-grant-program&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for integrating the community and government to better coordinate local involvement in the preparation, planning, mitigation, response and recovery stages of emergencies.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; The main mission of the Citizen Corps is to utilize every resource by means of education, training, and volunteer service to local security and readiness to respond to threats of terror, crime, health issues, and disasters.&lt;ref name=CCP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizencorps.gov/about|title=About Citizen Corps|work=Citizen Corps Official Site|accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCP allocations are determined using the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] formula, which specifies that each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico will receive a minimum of 75 percent of the total available grant funding.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; This leaves the remaining 25 percent of the total available grant funding to be allocated to the four territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; The balance of CCP funds are to be distributed on a population-share basis among all of the recipients.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

==Funding controversy==
Some criticism of the Homeland Security Grant Program has come from the distribution of funds. Not unlike other federal funding programs, the HSGP distributes a portion of funding based on population and distributes the remainder of funding evenly. For its part, the HSGP distributes 60% of funds on the basis of population, and the other 40% is evenly spread across all recipients regardless of population.&lt;ref name=SCAMS&gt;Bennett, James. ''Homeland Security Scams'', p. 64. Transaction Publishers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Wyoming for instance, despite being the least populous state, received more funding per capita in homeland security grants than any other state in 2004.&lt;ref name=SCAMS/&gt; At $45.22 per citizen of the state, Wyoming received more than four times the amount of funding per citizen given to either California or New York.&lt;ref name=SCAMS/&gt;
Another criticism has come from the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) in regards to the risk-based grant methodology.&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt; Although the GAO concluded that the overall risk-based methodology (threat, vulnerability and consequences) was reasonable, the absence of a proper way to measure variations in vulnerability greatly reduce the value of the vulnerability portion of the assessment.&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt; Ultimately, they concluded that the vulnerability measure as part of its risk analysis model should be amended to better capture variations in vulnerability across the different states and urban areas it assesses.&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08852.pdf|title=DHS Risk-Based Grant Methodology Is Reasonable, But Current Version’s Measure of Vulnerability is Limited|date=2008-10-02|accessdate=2010-11-16|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institut Lumière''' ({{IPA-fr|ɛ̃s.ti.ty ly.mjɛːʁ|pron}}; "Lumière Institute") is a French organisation, based in [[Lyon]], for the promotion and preservation of aspects of French [[film]] making. The Institut Lumière is a museum that honours the contribution to filmmaking by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] - inventors of the [[cinématographe]] and fathers of the [[film|cinema]].

It was founded in 1982 by Bernard Chardère and Maurice Trarieux-Lumière, the grandson of Louis Lumière.&lt;ref name="Mandelbaum2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mandelbaum|first1=Jacques|title=« Lumière !, l’aventure commence » : les toutes premières fois du cinéma|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cinema/article/2017/01/24/lumiere-l-aventure-commence-les-toutes-premieres-fois-du-cinema_5068025_3476.html|accessdate=10 February 2017|work=[[Le Monde]]|date=24 January 2017|language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Tavernier]] is its president and [[Thierry Frémaux]] is its director. The museum is located within the house of the Lumière family, in the [[Monplaisir (Lyon)|Monplaisir]] quarter of Lyon. The film ''[[La Sortie de l'usine Lumière à Lyon]]'', one of the earliest motion pictures ever made, was shot in the immediate vicinity of the Institut.

The rehabilitation of the former Lumière factories was confided to the architect Pierre Colboc and the Chief architect of historic monuments Didier Repellin, associated with the agency [[Ducks Scéno|dUCKS Scéno]] for the scenography of the cinema and the outer spaces.

'''Iris Habib Elmasry''' was born into a Coptic family in 1910. Her family name ''Elmasry'' in the [[Arabic language]] means [[Egyptians|The Egyptian]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Her father Habib Elmasry was the secretary of the [[General Congregation Council]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]]. She had two brothers; Amin, who was a prominent surgeon, and died in the 1960s, and Sami who was director of the Egyptian State Bureau for Tourism in London, and three sisters; Eva, who helped Iris in her work,&lt;ref name="Copts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukmidcopts.org/kotob/STRCOPT1.pdf|title=The story of the Copts By Iris habib Elmasry page 7|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soraya, an avid pianist, and Dora, who was married to Dr Aziz El Masry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copticmedical.com/Masry.htm|title=Coptic Medical society on Dr Aziz Elmasry|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406100819/http://www.copticmedical.com/Masry.htm|archivedate=2007-04-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habib Elmasry was the secretary of the General Congregation council for three terms, and was known for his strong support of ordination of a monk to be the [[Coptic pope]] and not a metropolitan or a bishop.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} This issue caused an ongoing dispute in the Coptic Orthodox Church and although [[The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church]] had considered in the 1960s the general bishops to be secretaries to the pope in the degree of a [[bishop]], Iris Elmasry in her [[List of Coptic Orthodox Popes of Alexandria]] considered Pope [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Shenouda III]] (1971–2012), who was a general bishop before, to be the fourth bishop to become a pope after Popes [[Pope John XIX of Alexandria|John XIX]] (1928&amp;ndash;1942), [[Pope Macarius III of Alexandria|Macarius III]] (1942&amp;ndash;1944)and [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria|Joseph II]] (1946&amp;ndash;1956).&lt;ref&gt;History of the Coptic Church, Iris Habib Elmasry Volume five&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmasry received her Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in education from Maria Grey College, [[University of London]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/people/El-Masry_Iris_1187715048.aspx |title=Iris El-Masry: ZoomInfo Business People Information |publisher=Zoominfo.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1952 and 1954, she pursued her research at [[Dropsie College]], [[Philadelphia]], and in 1955, she went to the [[National Gallery, London]], to obtain further materials and documents.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1954, Pope [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria|Joseph II]] appointed Elmasry as the female delegate of the Coptic Church to the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Evanston, Illinois, USA.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

From 1955 to 1985 Elmasry continued to lecture in [[Coptic History]] at both the Seminary in Cairo and Alexandria and at the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

She died on July 2, 1994.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Work==
Elmasry took interest in the history of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] and in 1948 published the first volume of her nine-volumes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copticbook.com/Page73.htm|title=www.copticbook.com/Page73.htm&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; book ''[[Story of the Coptic church]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wataninet.com/printer.asp?articleid=14312&amp;lang=en|title=Watani}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh volume of this history is about the era of Pope [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria|Cyril VI]] (1959&amp;ndash;1971): the book shows how highly appreciative she was of His Holiness's work.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

She considered [[Abouna Matta El Meskeen]] the Spiritual Father of the [[Monks]] in St. Macarius' [[Monastery]] in Scetis ([[Egypt]]) as her mentor and always expressed gratitude to him in the introductions to her books and also to father [[Bishoy Kamel]] of Alexandria.&lt;ref name="Copts" /&gt;

[[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria|Pope Youssab II]], the 115th Pope (1946–1956), appointed Elmasry in 1954 as his secretary for correspondence with the [[World Council of Churches]]. His successor [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria|Pope Kyrillos VI]], the 116th Pope (1959–1971), appointed her in 1966 as Counselor to young Coptic women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

While Elmasry's Arabic language publications are among the most widely quoted in the historical literature of the Coptic Church, her impressive work as a theologian, politician, psychologist, educator, and philanthropist is not as widely known. An article by Saad (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saad|first=Michael|title=Iris Habib el-Masry: A Pioneer of Coptic Feminine Theology|url=https://www.academia.edu/8903323/Iris_Habib_el-Masry_A_Pioneer_of_Coptic_Feminine_Theology|journal=Coptic Church Review|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; presents an introduction to her contributions to certain areas of politics and theology, while exploring in more detail unique features of her writing that may offer a framework for Coptic feminine theology.

Elmasry's work was very thorough: she made every effort not to omit details that she considered important. As a result, her work is more detailed, and of greater use to both academic and non-academic readers; is valuable for any researcher in [[Coptic history]] and provides a comprehensive approach to the history of Christianity in Egypt and point of view of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] regarding many debatable issue like [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxunity.org/article01.html|title=Orthodox Unity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to the first volume of her nine volumes book on the history of the Coptic Church, she mentions a conversation she had with a non-Egyptian about [[Council of Chalcedon]], during which she explained the Coptic view regarding the council.&lt;ref name="Copts" /&gt;

She used a lot of sources in her work and mentioned many known scripts in different languages. Her work shows clear affection towards her church, and high esteem for certain people in the church’s history. This may be the reason behind the way she presented the history of Pope [[Pope Cyril III of Alexandria|Cyril III]] in comparison to the way it was presented in Abouna [[Menassa Youhanna]]'s book ''History of the Coptic Church''.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Coptic Church, [[Abouna Menassa Elkomos Youhanna]] 1923&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James A. Mackay.jpg|thumb|James A. Mackay]]
'''James Alexander Mackay''' (21 November 1936 – 12 August 2007) was a prolific Scottish writer and [[Philately|philatelist]] whose output of philatelic works was rivalled only by [[Fred Melville]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} He was described by [[John R. Holman|John Holman]], editor of the ''[[British Philatelic Bulletin]]'', as a "philatelic writer without equal"&lt;ref&gt;''Gibbons Stamp Monthly'', October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but his reputation was damaged by a conviction for theft from the British Museum early in his career, which cost him his job there, and multiple accusations of plagiarism.

== Early life and family ==
James Mackay was born in Inverness on 21 November 1936. He was educated in Glasgow where he also attended the university. Later in life Mackay was awarded a Doctor of Literature (D.Litt) degree by [[Glasgow University]].

He married Renate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/628KAZHYu?url=http://www.gbstamps.com/gbcc/gbcc_mackay_intvw.html "In The Spotlight"], Great Britain Collectors Club, 1999. Retrieved 25 October 2017. Archived at webcitation.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scottish posts ==
Interested in [[Postage stamps|stamps]] and the [[postal system]] from an early age, he wrote two acclaimed histories of the Scottish posts; one limited to [[St. Kilda, Scotland|St. Kilda]] and, in 1978, his ''History of Scottish Postmarks, 1693-1978'', the definitive work on the subject. He became a prolific philatelic author, especially on English, Irish and Scottish [[postmark]]s and also produced popular Postal History Annuals and island series books. He wrote some 200 books and at least 10,000 articles. Mackay's interest in the postal history of St Kilda had been formed during his time stationed there during his army service in the 1950s.

== Theft from the British Museum ==
In 1972 Mackay was dismissed from his job as an assistant keeper at the [[British Library Philatelic Collections|British Museum]] in London after he was convicted at the [[Old Bailey]] of stealing valuable proof stamps.&lt;ref&gt;"Writer in disgrace as book halted by publisher" Stephen Breen &amp; Catherine Lockerbie, ''The Scotsman''.&lt;/ref&gt; He had pleaded guilty to five charges of stealing progressive proofs on loan from the [[Crown Agents Philatelic and Security Printing Archive|Crown Agents]] from the Museum in 1965 and 1966 and was fined £1000. He had exchanged the proofs with dealer [[Clive Feigenbaum]] for Winston Churchill themed stamps.&lt;ref&gt;"Stamp expert fined for thefts from museum" in ''The Times'', 6 September 1972, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
He was the editor of ''The Burns Chronicle'' from 1976 to 1992 which under his stewardship reached a level of quality and diversity it has not achieved before or since.{{citation required|date=October 2017}} He then turned to biography, where he was less successful. Through the 1980s he worked on a biography of [[Robert Burns]] which was published in 1992 to favourable reviews and which won the [[Saltire Society Literary Awards|Saltire Society Book of the Year Award]]. Subsequent biographies of [[Allan Pinkerton]] and [[William Wallace]] received more mixed reviews.

1996 saw the release of ''[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins: A Life]]'', a work about the life of the famed Irish revolutionary which received excellent reviews.

Mackay also wrote books under a number of different pseudonyms including Ian Angus, William Finlay, Bruce Garden, Alex Matheson and Peter Whittington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trussel.com/books/pseud_m.htm Author Pseudonyms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=phhhHT64kIMC&amp;lpg=PA356&amp;ots=e_uuGTMxxr&amp;dq=stamps%20%22Peter%20Whittington&amp;pg=PA356#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true International Who's Who of Authors, 2004, p.356]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of plagiarism==
In 1998, he published a biography of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. It was on the market briefly before [[Robert V. Bruce]] published a damning indictment, detailing sustained [[plagiarism]] of his own work, ''Alexander Graham Bell and the Conquest of Solitude''. Far from being a little-known work, the latter had in fact won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1973. The indictment, published in the [[American Historical Association]]'s house journal, counted instances of plagiarism on 80 percent of the pages published. Mackay paid his publishers to withdraw the book from circulation, and Bruce agreed not to sue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Ralph |author2=Lyall, Sarah |title=Repeat Accusations Of Plagiarism Taint Prolific Biographer |work=Sunday Book Review |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=21 September 1999 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E0DB1F3CF932A1575AC0A96F958260 |accessdate=10 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert V. Bruce in George Mason University's History News Network http://hnn.us/articles/633.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackay then published a biography of [[John Paul Jones]], the founder of the [[US Navy]]. While initially well received, and the subject of flattering reviews in the trade press, it was soon discovered that it was practically a copy of what those same reviews had marked as the last work on the man, that by [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] in 1942. That biography too had won the Pulitzer. Columbia University history professor [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]] was quoted in the ''[[New York Times]]'' as saying that the book was "a spectacular and sustained act of plagiarism."&lt;ref&gt;New York Times 25 Sep 1999 "Publisher Cancels Biography After Plagiarism Inquiry" [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E0D8133FF936A1575AC0A96F958260] retrieved on 9  Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scotland on Sunday]] "Muckle ’o grief as expert on the bard reviles ‘plagiarist’" [http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1597732001] retrieved on 9 Nov 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these accusations, Mackay continued to be commissioned to write articles for the philatelic press and it has been said that almost the entire text of some editions of ''Stamp &amp; Coin Mart'', a popular British magazine, were written by him.

== Death ==
Mackay died on 12 August 2007 at the age of 70 in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/obituaries.cfm?id=1343062007 Prolific writer on philatelic subjects and biographer of Burns] Scotsman.com (retrieved 4 November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Theories of the information society.'' Routledge, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Beniger was born in [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]], and received his BA in History from [[Harvard University]] in 1969, his MA in statistics and sociology from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where in 1978 he received his PhD in sociology.&lt;ref name="MW 2005"/&gt;

Beniger started his career in the early 1970s as staff writer for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', taught history, English, creative writing, and sociology on colleges and universities and travelled all around the world visiting over 40 countries.&lt;ref name="MW 2005"/&gt; In the 1980s he was appointed Professor of Communications and Sociology at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. in 1998-98 he served as president of the [[American Association for Public Opinion Research]].

Beniger died of [[Alzheimer's disease]] in 2010 in [[Torrance, California]] at the age of 63.

=== ''Quantitative graphics in statistics,'' 1981 ===
In the 1978 paper "Quantitative graphics in statistics: A brief history," Beniger &amp; Robyn argued, that "quantitative graphics have been central to the development of science, and statistical graphics date from the earliest attempts to analyze data. Many familiar forms, including bivariate plots, statistical maps, bar charts, and coordinate paper, were used in the 18th century."&lt;ref name = "B&amp;R 1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Beniger|first1=James R.| author-link1= |last2= Robyn |first2=Dorothy L. | author-link2= |title=Quantitative Graphics in Statistics: A Brief History|journal=[[The American Statistician]] |volume=32 |issue= 1 |pages=1–11 |jstor=2683467|date= 1978 |registration=yes  |doi=10.1080/00031305.1978.10479235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the development of statistical graphics over the centuries, according to Beniger &amp; Robyn, innovators had to tackle four problems:&lt;ref name = "B&amp;R 1978"/&gt;
* spatial organization, in the 17th and 18th centuries,
* discrete comparison, in the 18th and early 19th centuries, 
* continuous distribution, in the 19th century, and 
* multivariate distribution and correlation, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Beniger &amp; Robyn conclude, that in their days "statistical graphics appear to be reemerging as an important analytic tool, with recent innovations exploiting computer graphics and related technologies." This was confirmed by W. H. Kruskall (1975), who specified:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;The role of statistical graphics within statistics generally... has had tremendous ups and downs: at one time, graphical methods were near the core of statistics-Karl Pearson devoted considerable attention to graphics and he was following the emphasis of his hero, Francis Galton. Later on, statistical graphics became neglected and even scorned in comparison with the blossoming of the mathematical side of statistics. In recent years, however, there has been a renaissance of concern with graphics and some of our best statistical minds have suggested new graphical approaches of great interest.&lt;ref&gt;Kruskal, W. (1977), "Visions of Maps and Graphs," ''Proceedings of the International Symposium on Computer Assisted Cartography, Auto-Carto II,'' 1975, p. 31; as cited in Beniger &amp; Robyn (1978, p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Developments in Statistical Graphics ===
The 1978 paper by Beniger &amp; Robyn is complemented with an appendix on the developments in Statistical Graphics which starts with: 
::c. 3800 B.C. Oldest known map (of Northern Mesopotamia) extant on clay tablet &lt;ref name = "B&amp;R 1978"/&gt;
And ends with: 
::1977 "Cartesian rectangle" to represent 2 x 2 table, experimentally tested against other forms Wainer and Mark Reiser, U.S. [87];
:::Ad Hoc Committee on Statistical Graphics, American Statistical Association.&lt;ref name = "B&amp;R 1978"/&gt;
This timeline is further developed into [[Michael Friendly]]'s "Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization" (2008).

'''John Frederick Carden Michell''' (9 February 1933 &amp;ndash; 24 April 2009) was an English author and [[Western esotericism|esotericist]] who was a prominent figure in the development of the [[Earth mysteries]] movement. Over the course of his life he published over forty books on an array of different subjects, being a proponent of the [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] school of esoteric thought.

Born in [[London]] to a wealthy family, Michell was educated at [[Cheam School]] and [[Eton College]] before serving as a Russian translator in the [[Royal Navy]] for two years. After failing a degree in Russian and German at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], he returned to London and worked for his father's property business, there developing his interest in [[Ufology]].
Embracing the counter-cultural ideas of the Earth mysteries movement during the 1960s, in ''The Flying Saucer Vision'' he built on [[Alfred Watkins]]' ideas of [[ley lines]] by arguing that they represented linear marks created in prehistory to guide extraterrestrial spacecraft. He followed this with his most influential work, ''The View Over Atlantis'', in 1969. His ideas were at odds with those of academic archaeologists, for whom he expressed contempt. 
Michell believed in the existence of an ancient spiritual tradition that connected humanity to divinity, but which had been lost as a result of [[modernity]]. He believed however that this tradition would be revived and that humanity would enter a [[Golden Age]], with Britain as the centre of this transformation.

Michell's other publications covered an eclectic range of topics, and included an overview on the [[Shakespeare authorship]] question, a tract condemning [[Salman Rushdie]] during [[The Satanic Verses controversy|''The Satanic Verses'' controversy]], and a book of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s quotations. Keenly interested in the [[crop circle]] phenomenon, he co-founded a magazine devoted to the subject, ''The Cereologist'', in 1990, and served as its initial editor. From 1992 until his death he wrote a column for ''[[The Oldie]]'' magazine, which was largely devoted to his anti-modernist opinions. He accompanied this with a column on esoteric topics for the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' tabloid.
A lifelong [[marijuana]] smoker, Michell died of [[lung cancer]] in 2009.

Michell's impact in the Earth mysteries movement was considerable, and through it he also influenced the British Pagan movement. During the 2000s, his ideas also proved an influence on the [[Tyr (journal)|Radical Traditionalist]] sector of the [[New Right]].

==Biography==
===Early life===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="When I was at Cambridge the whole atmosphere was extremely rationalistic materialistic. Everyone believed the current academic orthodoxies of the time and there seemed no way of questioning them. I was never really sympathetic to them, but I saw no way of questioning them. The first possibility of a breakout occurred to me at the beginning of the UFO phenomenon, in the Fifties when the first UFO books were coming out. It was quite obvious that people were having experiences that weren't allowed for within the context of our education."|source=— John Michell.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1a2=Roberts|1y=2007|1p=179|2a1=Screeton|2y=2010|2p=7}} }}

John Frederic Carden Michell was born in London on 9 February 1933.{{sfnm|1a1=Martin|1y=2009|2a1=Anon|2y=2009|3a1=Screeton|3y=2010|3p=1}} His father, Alfred, was of Cornish descent and worked as a property dealer in the capital,{{sfnm|1a1=Anon|1y=2009|2a1=Screeton|2y=2010|2p=1}} while his mother Enid (née Carden) was the daughter of baronet Sir [[Carden baronets|Frederick Carden]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=1}} The eldest of three children, Michell's siblings were named Charles and Clare.{{sfnm|1a1=Anon|1y=2009|2a1=Screeton|2y=2010|2p=1}}
Michell was raised at [[Stargroves]], his maternal grandfather's Victorian-era estate on the [[Berkshire Downs]] near to [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], and it was here that he developed a love of the countryside, learning about the local flora and fauna from a neighbouring [[natural history|naturalist]].{{sfnm|1a1=Anon|1y=2009|2a1=Screeton|2y=2010|2p=1}} He was raised into the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] denomination of [[Christianity]], although in later life rejected the religion.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=46}}
Michell was initially educated as a boarder at the preparatory [[Cheam School]], where he was Head Boy and excelled at the [[high jump]].{{sfnm|1a1=Anon|1y=2009|2a1=Screeton|2y=2010|2p=2}} From there he went to study at [[Eton College]], where he was a contemporary of Lord Moyne and Ian Cameron, the father of future Prime Minister [[David Cameron]].{{sfn|Anon|2009}}

He spent his two years of [[National Service in the United Kingdom#After 1945|national service]] in the [[Royal Navy (UK)|Royal Navy]], during which time he qualified as a Russian [[translator]] at the [[UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies|School of Slavonic Studies]].{{sfnm|1a1=Martin|1y=2009|2a1=Screeton|2y=2010|2p=2}} He then went on to study Russian and German at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], although was unable to secure even a [[British undergraduate degree classification#Third-class honours|third-class degree]].{{sfnm|1a1=Anon|1y=2009|2a1=Screeton|2y=2010|2p=2}} He then qualified as a [[chartered surveyor]] at a firm in [[Gloucestershire]], before moving back to London to work for his father's property business.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=2}} Commenting on this job, he later stated that it was "quite amusing, but of course I wasn't any good at it",{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=2}} with property speculators eroding much of his fortune.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=2}}

In 1966 one of his properties, the basement of his own residence, became the base of the [[London Free School]]. The Black Power activist [[Michael X]], having previously run a gambling club in the basement, had now become active in the organisation of the LFS and brought Michell into counter-culture activities. Michell began to offer courses in UFOs and ley lines.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Miles (2010) - London Calling: A Countercultural History of London since 1945. p 187&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1964, with [[Jocasta Innes]], Michell fathered a son, [[Jason Goodwin]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10013601/Jocasta-Innes.html Obituary: Jocasta Innes], telegraph.co.uk, 23 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; who also became a writer. The relationship with Innes did not last. Jason Goodwin did not meet his natural father until 1992, at the age of 28, at which they became quite close.{{sfn|Martin|2009}}

===Embracing the Earth Mysteries movement===

Michell developed an interest in Ufology and Earth mysteries after attending a talk given by [[Jimmy Goddard]] at [[Kensington Central Library]] on the subject of "Leys and Orthonies" in November 1965.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=10}} Michell's first publication on the subject of Ufology was the article "Flying Saucers", which appeared in the 30 January 1967 edition of the counter-cultural newspaper ''[[International Times]]''.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=5&amp;ndash;6}} He proceeded to write a book on the subject, but lost the original manuscript after accidentally leaving it in a North London café, at which he had to rewrite it.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=6}} The book eventually saw publication as ''The Flying Saucer Vision'', published in 1967, when Michell was 35 years old.{{sfnm|1a1=Screeton|1y=2010|1pp=6&amp;ndash;7|2a1=Hutton|2y=2013|2p=136}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="Although the British Earth Mysteries movement existed in some fashion before John Michell came onto the scene, Michell functioned in a synthetic fashion by bringing together and popularizing several different strands of esoteric belief relating to sacred Britain, and in the late 1960s he found a new market hungry for publications on such subjects."|source=— Amy Hale, 2011.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=82}} }}

''The Flying Saucer Vision'' took the idea of [[Tony Wedd]] that [[ley lines]] &amp;ndash; alleged trackways across the landscape whose existence was first argued by [[Alfred Watkins]] &amp;ndash; represented markers for the flight of extraterrestrial spacecraft and built on it, arguing that early human society was aided by alien entities who were understood as gods, but that these extraterrestrials had abandoned humanity because of the latter's greed for material and technological development.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=136}}
According to Lachman, at this time Michell took the view that "an imminent revelation of literally inconceivable scope" was at hand, and that the appearance of UFOs was linked to "the start of a new phase in our history".&lt;ref name="Lachman370"&gt;[[#refLachman|Lachman, p 370]]&lt;/ref&gt; Many fans of Michell's work consider it to be "by far his most impressive book".{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=6}} In their social history of Ufology, David Clarke and Andy Roberts stated that Michell's work was "the catalyst and helmsman" for the growing interest in UFOs among the [[hippie]] sector of the counter-culture.{{sfn|Clarke|Roberts|2007|p=181}}

Subsequently, there was a shift in Michell's emphasis as he became increasingly interested in the landscapes in which he believed that ley lines could be found rather than the UFOs themselves.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=11}} He wrote an article on "Lung Mei and the Dragon Paths of England" for a September 1967 issue of ''Image'' magazine, in which he compared British ley-lines to the [[Chinese mythology|Chinese mythological]] idea of ''[[lung mei]]'' lines, arguing that this was evidence of a widespread pre-Christian dragon cult in ancient Britain.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=19}} He built on these ideas for ''The View Over Atlantis'', a book which he privately published in 1969, with a republication following three years later.{{sfnm|1a1=Screeton|1y=2010|1pp=16, 18|2a1=Hutton|2y=2013|2p=136}} Believing this earth energy to be a real magnetic phenomenon arising naturally from the ground, Michell argued that an ancient religious-scientific elite had traveled the world constructing the lines and various megalithic monuments in order to channel this energy and direct it for the good of humanity.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=136}} The tone of his work reflected "a fervent religious feeling", describing the existence of an ancient, universal, and true system of belief that was once spread across the ancient world but which had been lost through the degeneracy of subsequent generations. He added however that this ancient knowledge would be revived with the dawning of the [[Age of Aquarius]], allowing for what Michell described as the "rediscovery of access to the divine will".{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=136}}

[[File:Glastonbury Tor from north east showing terraces.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Michell viewed Glastonbury (pictured) as a place of sacred power]]

The [[Pagan studies]] scholar Amy Hale stated that ''The View Over Atlantis'' was "a smash countercultural success",{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=81}} while the historian [[Ronald Hutton]] described it as "almost the founding document of the modern [[earth mysteries]] movement".{{sfn|Hutton|1991|p=121}} Fellow ley-hunter and later biographer Paul Screeton considered it to be a "groundbreaking" work which "re-enchanted the British landscape and empowered a generation to seek out and appreciate the spiritual dimension of the countryside, not least attracting them to reawaken the sleepy town of [[Glastonbury]]".{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=16}} 
The book inspired an array of Earth Mysteries publications in the 1970s and 1980s, accompanied by growth in the ley-hunting movement.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=137}} Among the most prominent works to build on Michell's ideas during this period were Janet and Colin Bord's ''Mysterious Britain'', which used them in its presentation of a gazetteer of ancient sites, and [[Paul Screeton]]'s ''Quicksilver Heritage'', which argued that the Neolithic had been a time devoted to spiritual endeavours which had been corrupted by the emergence of metal technologies.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=137}} Michell associated with many individuals active in this ley-hunting community, and in July 1971 was one of many attendees at a ley-hunters picnic held at [[Risbury Camp]], the largest outdoor gathering of the movement since 1939.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=29&amp;ndash;30}}

In May 1969 Michell established a group known as the [[Research Into Lost Knowledge Organisation]] (RILKO) with his friends Keith Critchlow and Mary Williams.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=85}} In conjunction with the [[Garnstone Press]], RILKO founded the Prehistory and Ancient Science Library, a book series that brought out reprints of older works, such as Watkins' ''The Old Straight Track'' and [[William Stirling IV|William Stirling]]'s ''The Canon'', both of which contained forewords by Michell.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=85}} Michell also founded a small publishing company of his own, West Country Editions, through which he brought out his own ''A Little History of Bladud'' in 1973 as well as a reprint of [[Howard C. Levis]]'s 1919 book ''Bladud of Bath''.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=85}} With his friend John "Peewee" Michael, who lived in [[Bristol]], Michell also established a second small press, Pentacle Books, although it failed to become a commercial success and was short lived.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=84, 86&amp;ndash;87}}

Michell was involved in the summer 1971 [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury Fayre]] music festival near [[Pilton, Somerset]], where the pyramid stage was built to Michell's specifications and situated at what he claimed were the apex of two ley lines.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=30}} Through [[Michael Rainey]], Michell was introduced to the members of rock band [[The Rolling Stones]] at the Courtfield Road home of band member [[Brian Jones]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=98}} Michell befriended the band's lead singer, [[Mick Jagger]],{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=3}} and he accompanied the band on a visit to [[Stonehenge]].{{sfn|Clarke|Roberts|2007|p=185}} Michell then went on a visit to [[Woolhope]] in [[Herefordshire]] with [[Keith Richards]], [[Anita Pallenberg]], [[Christopher Gibbs]], and the filmmaker [[Kenneth Anger]], where they hunted for ley lines and UFOs.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=99&amp;ndash;100}} [[Marianne Faithfull]] later recounted that band member Jones was particularly interested in Michell's ideas.{{sfn|Clarke|Roberts|2007|p=185}} He would later meet with the members of [[The Grateful Dead]] on their 1972 European tour; band members [[Phil Lesh]] and [[Jerry Garcia]] expressed an interest in Michell's Earth Mysteries ideas.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=101}}

Michell's impact on the hippie subculture was recognised by mainstream media, and he was invited to submit an article titled "Flying saucers" to ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' in May 1968, which was accompanied by a critical piece by editor [[Karl Miller]], in which Michell was described as "less a hippy, perhaps, than a hippy's counsellor, one of their junior Merlins."{{sfn|Clarke|Roberts|2007|p=187}}
Hale noted that Michell promoted the idea of "England as a site of spiritual redemption in the [[New Age]]", bringing together "popular ideas about sacred geometry, Druids, sacred landscapes, earth energies, Atlantis, and UFOs".{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=82}}

In 1972 Michell published a sequel to ''The View Over Atlantis'' as ''City of Revelation''.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=17}} Shortly after publication he stated that he had written the work in "almost two years of near total solitude and intense study in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]."{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=42}} This work was more complex than its predecessor, including chapters on [[sacred geometry]], [[numerology]], [[gematria]], and the esoteric concept of the [[New Jerusalem]], and required an understanding of mathematics and Classics to follow its arguments.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=41}} 
[[Bob Rickard]], founding editor of ''[[Fortean Times]]'', has written that Michell's first three works "provided a synthesis of and a context for all the other weirdness of the era. It’s fair to say that it played a big part in the foundation of ''Fortean Times'' itself by helping create a readership that wanted more things to think about and a place to discuss them. The overall effect was to help the burgeoning interest in strange phenomena spread out into mainstream culture."  &lt;ref name="The Man from Atlantis"&gt;[[Bob Rickard|Rickard, Bob]]. [http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/1653/the_man_from_atlantis.html The Man from Atlantis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423125449/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/1653/the_man_from_atlantis.html |date=23 April 2009 }}, ''[[Fortean Times]]'', April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenging academic archaeology===

[[File:New Jerusalem (Michell) Sacred Geometry.svg|thumb|Michell's "New Jerusalem" sacred geometry diagram]]

The work of Michell and others in the ley-hunting and Earth mysteries communities were rejected by the professional archaeological establishment, with the prominent British archaeologist [[Glyn Daniel]] denouncing what he perceived as the "lunatic fringe".{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=25}} In turn, Michell was hostile to professional and academic archaeologists, accusing them of "treasure hunting and grave robbery" and viewing them as representations of what he interpreted as the evils of modernity.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=136&amp;ndash;137}} In response to the academic archaeological community's refusal to take the idea of ley lines seriously, in 1970 Michell offered a challenge for professional archaeologists to disprove his ideas regarding the West Peninsula leys. He stated that were he to be proved wrong then he would donate a large sum to charity, but at the time no one took up his offer.{{sfnm|1a1=Screeton|1y=2010|1pp=22&amp;ndash;23, 26|2a1=Hutton|2y=2013|2p=139}}

However, in 1983 his case study was analysed by two archaeologists, Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy, as part of their work ''Ley Lines in Question'', a critical analysis of the evidence for ley-lines. They highlighted that Michell had erroneously included medieval crosses and natural features under his definition of late prehistoric monuments, and that arguments for ley-lines more widely could not be sustained.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=139}} The impact of their work on the ley-hunting community was substantial, with one section moving in a more fully religious direction by declaring that leys could only be detected by [[intuition]], and the other renouncing a ley line belief in favour of a more ethnographically-rooted analysis of linear connections in the landscape.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=140}} Responding to their work, Michell said that "I just feel sorry for Williamson and Bellamy that the most exciting thing they can find to do with their youth is to discredit the ley vision."{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=36}}

In 1983 Michell published an altered version of his best known work as ''The New View Over Atlantis''.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=27}}

[[Ioan P. Culianu|Ioan Culianu]], a specialist in [[gnosticism]] and [[Renaissance]] esoteric studies, in a review in 1991 of ''The Dimensions of Paradise: The Proportions and Symbolic Numbers in Ancient Cosmology'', expressed the view that, "After some deliberation the reader of this book will oscillate between two hypotheses: either that many mysteries of the universe are based on numbers, or that the book's author is a fairly learned crank obsessed with numbers." &lt;ref&gt;[[#refCulianu|Culianu, 1991]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Michell founded the Anti-Metrification Board to oppose the adoption of the [[metric system]] of measurement in the United Kingdom. Believing that the established [[imperial system]] of measurement had both ancient and sacred origins, through the Board he brought out a newsletter, ''Just Measure''.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=69}} In 1972 he published the first of his "Radical Traditionalist Papers", ''A Defence of Sacred Measures'', in which he laid out his opposition to the metric system.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=69}}
In his third Radical Traditionalist Paper, published in 1973, he argued against [[population control]], critiquing the ideas of [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] and arguing that correct use of resources could maintain an ever-growing human population.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=72&amp;ndash;73}}
His fifth Radical Traditionalist Paper, ''Concordance to High Monarchists'', offered Michell's proposed solution to [[The Troubles]] of Northern Ireland; in his view, Ireland should be divided into four provinces, each administered separately but all ultimately pledging allegiance to a High King, in this way mirroring what Michell believed was the socio-political organisation of prehistoric Ireland.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=65}}

Following the 1975 execution of [[Michael X]] for a murder committed in Trinidad, Michell published a souvenir pamphlet to commemorate the execution, claiming that all royalties from its publication would go to Michael X's widow.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=61}} In 1976 he published ''The Hip Pocket Hitler'', a book containing those quotations from [[Adolf Hitler]], the leader of [[Nazi Germany]], which Michell deemed to be humorous or insightful, thus seeking to portray a side to Hitler that was more favourable than the dominant paradigm.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=62}} In 1979 he provided an introduction to a translation of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Inventorum Natura]]'', which had been illustrated by [[Una Woodruff]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=82&amp;ndash;83}} That same year he brought out ''Simulcra'', a work in which he examined perceived faces in natural forms such as trees.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=53}} In collaboration with [[Bob Rickard]], in 1977 Michell published ''Phenomena: A Book of Wonders'', an encyclopedic work devoted to [[paranormal]] and [[fortean]] phenomena which covered such topics as UFOs, [[werewolves]], [[lake monsters]], and [[spontaneous human combustion]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=51&amp;ndash;52}} They followed this with a second encyclopedic volume, ''Living Wonders: Mysteries and Curiosities of the Animal World'', which appeared in 1982 and was devoted to fortean topics involving animals, with much of it focusing on [[cryptozoology|cryptozoological]] topics.{{Sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=52&amp;ndash;53}}

In 1984 he published ''Eccentric Lives and Peculiar Notions'', in which he provided brief biographies of various figures whose ideas had been rejected by mainstream scholarship and society, among them [[Nesta Webster]], [[Iolo Morganwg]], [[Brinsley Le Poer Trench]], and [[Comyns Beaumont]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=78}} In ''Euphonics: A Poet's Dictionary of Sounds'' he then argued that every name represents a "vocal imitation" of the subject that it describes, for instance arguing that "s" appears in the words "snake" and "serpent" because it resembles the curved movement of the animal.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=78&amp;ndash;79}}
Following the [[The Satanic Verses controversy|controversy that erupted]] around [[Salman Rushdie]]'s 1988 book ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', Michell published a tract condemning Rushdie, accusing him of deliberately and provocatively insulting [[Islam]]. Titled ''Rushdie's Insult'', Michell later withdrew the publication.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=60&amp;ndash;61}}

Michell was keenly interested in the [[crop circle]] phenomenon, and with Christine Rhone and Richard Adams he established a magazine devoted to the subject in 1990. Initially titled ''The Cereologist'', some issues would be alternately titled ''The Cerealogist'', and although Michell initially served as the magazine's editor, he stepped down after the ninth issue, although continued to contribute articles to it.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=54&amp;ndash;55}} In 1991, he published a book on the subject, ''Dowsing the Crop Circles'',{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=55}} and in 2001 followed this with a booklet titled ''The Face and the Message'', which was devoted to a circle depicting the face of a [[Grey alien]] which had appeared in [[Hampshire]] in August 2001.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=55&amp;ndash;56}} Despite the longstanding animosity with which Michell held academic archaeology, in 1991 the peer-reviewed archaeological journal ''Antiquity'' invited him to author a review of a Southbank exhibit, "From Art to Archaeology", which was duly published in the journal.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=92}}

In the 1980s Michell was a member of the [[Lindisfarne Association]] and a teacher at its School of Sacred Architecture. He lectured at the Kairos Foundation, an "educational charity specifically founded to promote the recovery of traditional values in the Arts and Sciences".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kairos-foundation.com/ Karios Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; He was for some years a visiting lecturer at the [[Prince of Wales]]' [[The Prince's School of Traditional Arts|School of Traditional Arts]], which had been established by his friend [[Keith Critchlow]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=92}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psta.org.uk/about/trusteesandstaff Prince's School past &amp; present staff list]&lt;/ref&gt; He became a Fellow of the [[Temenos Academy]], a religious organisation which had Traditionalist underpinnings.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=82}}

===Newspaper columnist: 1992&amp;ndash;2009===

From January 1992 until his death, Michell published a monthly column, "An Orthodox Voice", in ''[[The Oldie]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=89}} He primarily used this as an outlet for condemning the modern world and lambasting what he perceived as the stupidity of most contemporary humans.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=89}} His first article in this outlet contained an attack on [[evolution]] which resulted in a published response from the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=89&amp;ndash;90}} He also used his column to encourage the use of mind-altering drugs, in particular [[LSD]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=95&amp;ndash;96}} Two anthologies that collected together some of these ''Oldie'' columns would be published; the first appeared in 1995 as ''An Orthodox Voice'' while the second was published in 2005 as ''Confessions of a Radical Traditionalist'' and contained an introduction from the scholar of esotericism [[Joscelyn Godwin]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=90}} During this period, Michell also authored occasional book review for the conservative magazine, ''[[The Spectator]]''.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=97}}

[[File:Stoke Abbott, parish church of St. Mary - geograph.org.uk - 447454.jpg|thumb|left|St Mary's Church, Stoke Abbott, where Michell's body was interned]]

In 1996 Michell published ''Who Wrote Shakespeare?'', in which he outlined various candidates in the [[Shakespeare authorship question]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=79&amp;ndash;80}} ''Who Wrote Shakespeare?'' received mixed reviews: ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' was critical,&lt;ref&gt;Publishers Weekly, 22 July 1996 v243 n30 p223&lt;/ref&gt; while ''The Washington Post'' and ''[[The Independent]]'' praised his treatment of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990425/ai_n14219130 Shakespeare in doubt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017173131/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990425/ai_n14219130 |date=17 October 2008 }}, ''[[The Independent]]'', April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; To mark their fiftieth anniversary in 1999, the publisher Thames and Hudson &amp;ndash; who had published many of Michell's works &amp;ndash; suggested that a biography be written by Michell's friend Paul Screeton. Michell however refused to cooperate with the project, which was abandoned.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=52}} In 2000, Michell published ''The Temple at Jerusalem: A Revelation'', in which he outlined his own interpretation of [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Jerusalem's Old City]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=65&amp;ndash;66}}

From 2001 to 2004 he contributed several columns to tabloid newspaper ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' as part of an ongoing series run by the [[astrology|astrologer]] [[Jonathan Cainer]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=15}} Cainer had sought to bring together a range of esotericists to write on related topics, with Michell's fellow contributors including [[Mark Winter]], [[Patty Greenall]], [[Sarah Sirillan]], and [[Uri Geller]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=88}} The series came to an end when Cainer left ''The Mirror'' to work for the rival ''[[Daily Mail]]''.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=89}}

A keen painter,{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=73}} in 2003 an exhibit of his works was held at the [[Christopher Gibbs Gallery]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=92}} In April 2007 Michell married Denise Price, the Archdruidess of the Glastonbury Order of Druids, at a ceremony held in Glastonbury's [[St Benedict's Church]], although their relationship ended several months later.{{sfnm|1a1=Martin|1y=2009|2a1=Anon|2y=2009|3a1=Screeton|3y=2010|3pp=3, 94}} A lifelong smoker, Michell contracted [[lung cancer]],{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=102}} and in his final days he was nursed at his son's home in [[Poole]], Dorset, ultimately dying on 24 April 2009, at the age of 76.{{sfnm|1a1=Martin|1y=2009|2a1=Screeton|2y=2010|2pp=3, 95}} His body was buried at St Mary's Church in [[Stoke Abbott]] on [[May Day]].{{sfnm|1a1=Anon|1y=2009|2a1=Screeton|2y=2010|2p=103}} A [[high church]] memorial service was then held at All Saints' Church in Notting Hill, which was attended by around 400 mourners.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=103}} 
His work, ''How the World is Made'' &amp;ndash; which he regarded as his ''magnum opus'' &amp;ndash; was published posthumously.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=92, 104}}

==Thought==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The essentials of John's personal cosmology can be summarized simple as: the human mind can be seen imaged in the canon, a complete cosmology and model of all reality; the origin of human intelligence is still totally mysterious, with no evidence of evolution or gradual development; neither of the above were the result of intervention other than revelation, as sacred history and tradition avers; humankind has been in decline since early prehistory."|source=— Michell's friend and biographer Paul Screeton, 2010.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=40}} }}

Throughout his life, Michell's "views remained relatively static", albeit with some exceptions.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=14}} He characterised his viewpoint as "Radical Traditionalism", which in his words was a perspective "both idealistic and rooted in common sense".{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=67}}
Michell was a proponent of the [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] school of esoteric thought.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=83}} Michell was also interested in the writings of Traditionalist philosopher [[Julius Evola]], agreeing in particular with the sentiments expressed in Evola's ''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]''.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=83}} He held to the Traditionalist belief in an ancient [[Perennial philosophy|perennial tradition]] found across the world, believing that this was passed on by a priesthood in accordance to divine will.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=83}} He shared the Traditionalist attitude of anti-modernism, believing that modernity had brought about chaos, destruction of the land, and spiritual degradation.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=83}} He believed that humanity would return to what he perceived as its natural order and enter a [[Golden Age]].{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=83}}

Screeton believed that despite his "obvious acts of liberalism", Michell also had a "right-wing streak",{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=58}} with Hale describing Mitchell as being "quite right-wing in many of his views".{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=94}} She thought it would be "apt" to characterise Mitchell's thought as being "[[Third Position|third positionist]]" in nature.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=94}}

Angered by the idea of [[evolution]], Michell repeatedly authored articles denouncing it as a false [[creation myth]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=70}} Instead he embraced a viewpoint that Screeton referred to as "intelligent design creationism".{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=49}} Accordingly, he was particularly critical of [[Charles Darwin]] and Dawkins, lambasting the latter alongside physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] as belonging with "the disappointed [[Marxism|Marxists]], pandering politicians, pettifoggers, grievance-mongers and atheistic bishops who set the tone in modern society."{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=72}} Condemning the scientific community's view of the development of the Earth and humanity, he embraced [[Richard Milton (author)|Richard Milton]]'s claim that the Earth was only 20,000 years old,{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=72}} as well as [[Rupert Sheldrake]]'s idea regarding "morphogenetic fields", believing that it was these &amp;ndash; and not biological evolution &amp;ndash; that resulted in changes occurring within species.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=72}}

Mitchell's conception of the physical and spiritual worlds was strongly influenced by the ancient Greek philosopher [[Plato]].{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=85}} He believed that [[sacred geometry]] revealed a universal scheme in the landscape which reflected the structure of the heavens.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=85}} His views on geometry led him to the belief that pre-industrial societies across the world respected the Earth as a living creature imbued with its own spirit, and that humans then created permanent residences for this spirit.{{Sfn|Screeton|2010|p=47}}
He also embraced a belief in the tenets of [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and [[prophecy]], believing that all had been unfairly rejected by the modern world.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=74}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="A hallmark of the traditionalist is to see decline and degeneracy where other people see modernity and progress."|source=— John Michell.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=109}} }}

Described as an exponent of "British nativist spirituality",{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=87}} he adopted the view of the [[British Israelism|British-Israelite movement]] that the British people represented the descendants of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] who are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]].{{sfn|Hale|2011|pp=89&amp;ndash;90}} Michell sometimes referred to his approach as "mystic nationalism" and interpreted the island of Britain as being sacred, connecting this attitude to those of [[William Blake]] and [[Lewis Spence]].{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=82}} Adopting a [[millennialism|millennialist]] attitude, he believed that in future Britain would be reborn as the [[New Jerusalem]] with the coming of a new Golden Age.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=88}}

He believed that humans really desired to live in a state of extreme order,{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=83}} deeming a societal hierarchy to be natural and inevitable.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=43}} Generally opposed to [[democracy]], except within small groups in which every person knew the individual being elected, Michell instead believed that communities should be led by a strong leader who personified the solar deity.{{sfn|Hale|2011|pp=83&amp;ndash;84, 86}} This embrace of the [[Divine Right of Kings]] led him to believe that Queen [[Elizabeth II]] should take control of Britain as an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] leader who could intercede between the British people and the divine.{{sfn|Hale|2011|pp=83&amp;ndash;84}} He was critical of [[multiculturalism]] in Britain, believing that each ethnic or cultural group should live independently in an area segregated from other groups, stating that this would allow a people's traditions to remain vibrant.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=84}} He did not espouse racial supremacy, with his ideas on this subject instead being similar to the [[ethnopluralism]] of [[Alain de Benoist]] and other New Right thinkers.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=85}} He was an opponent of British membership of the [[European Union]] and also opposed the UK's transition to the [[metric system]], instead favouring the continued use of [[Imperial units|imperial measurement]], believing that the latter had links to the divine order used by ancient society.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=87}}

==Personal life==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="Michell was a one-off. An original. There will never be another like him. John was a scholar, polymath, iconoclast, antiquarian and mystic. An intellectual with an easy manner, dry wit and elegant writing style. A philosopher and author. With his revolutionary vision of prehistoric science far in advance of that accorded early civilisations by archaeologists &amp;ndash; a modern-day [[Merlin]] of hippiedom &amp;ndash; he greatly influenced the [[baby boomer]] generation by extolling countercultural values in the areas of earth mysteries, consciousness expansion and New Age thinking."|source=— Michell's friend and biographer Paul Screeton, 2010.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=1}} }}

At over six feet in height, Michell was described by biographer and friend Paul Screeton as having "a charismatic personality and imposing presence",{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=2}} being "placidly outgoing and the epitome of gentlemanly charm",{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=58}} and usually appeared "cheerful and optimistic".{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=37}}
In keeping with his upper-class background, he was described as having an "unmistakable patrician hauteur",{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=138}} with "all the self-assurance, impeccable manners and debonair charm of one born to wealth."{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=2}} Screeton described Michell as "gregarious but slightly shy, unassuming but opinionated. Quixotic in behaviour, he was an exemplary host and fastidious and single-minded when embarked upon a project",{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=2}} although also noted that Michell was impatient with those who did not share his Traditionalist beliefs and values.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=89}}

In keeping with norms within the counter-culture, Michell regularly smoked [[marijuana]],{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=3}} and publicly encouraged the use of mind-altering drugs.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|pp=95&amp;ndash;96}} His favoured newspaper was ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', a right-wing daily.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=59}} One of his hobbies was woodworking, and he constructed some of the bookshelves in his home.{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=92}} Although he had a strong dislike of computers and advised his readers not to possess a [[personal computer]], in later life he obtained one in order to type up his writings using a [[word processor]].{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=82}} For many years, he lived at 11 Powis Gardens in [[Notting Hill]], [[North London]].{{Sfn|Screeton|2010|p=99}}

==Legacy==

Screeton described Michell as "a countercultural icon",{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=3}} while Hale stated that on his death, Michell left "a rich legacy of publications and cultural influence".{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=82}} At the time he was remembered as "a charming British eccentric and champion of the outsider".{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=96}} His influence was strongly apparent in the British Pagan community, with many British Pagans being familiar with his writings.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=91}} The archaeologist Adam Stout noted that Michell played "the major role in the 1960s rediscovery" of the work of Alfred Watkins.{{sfn|Stout|2008|p=195}}
Hutton for instance noted that the influence of Michell's ideas could be seen on the Druidic Order of the Pendragon, a Pagan group based in [[Leicestershire]] that arose to public attention in 2004.{{sfn|Hutton|2009|p=347}} His ideas about dragon energies across the landscape have been incorporated into novels like [[Judy Allen]]'s 1973 ''The Spring of the Mountain'' and [[Cara Louise]]'s 2006 ''Annie and the Dragon''.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=179}}

Michell's books received a broadly positive reception amongst the "New Age" and "Earth mysteries" movements and he is credited as perhaps being "the most articulate and influential writer on the subject of leys and alternative studies of the past".&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Danny, ''Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery'' Green Magic, 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-9542963-4-6}} p, 11 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Zl356ACEhs0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22john+michell%22+%22earth+mysteries%22&amp;ots=ypIUcZ6YgH&amp;sig=gdIg-BonBQHT55rz3CRtLd3hEdY#PPA11,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Hutton]] describes his research as part of an alternative archaeology "quite unacceptable to orthodox scholarship." &lt;ref name="Hutton127"&gt;[[#refHutton|Hutton, p 127]]&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Screeton noted that during his life, Michell was considered to be "anathema, lunatic fringe, and cranky" by his critics,{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=68}} although he rejected the idea that Michell was a "crank", claiming that such an accusation was "fundamentally mistaken".{{sfn|Screeton|2010|p=67}}

Following his death, various aspects of Michell's work have been adopted by thinkers associated with the European [[Nouvelle Droite|New Right]] and with related right-wing currents in the United States.{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=77}}
Michell's term "Radical Traditionalism", which he espoused in his self-published series of "Radical Traditionalist Papers" in the 1970s and 1980s, would later be taken up as a self-descriptor by [[Michael C. Moynihan|Michael Moynihan]] and [[Joshua Buckley]], the editors of the right-wing journal ''[[Tyr (journal)|Tyr: Myth, Culture and Tradition]]'' from their inaugural 2002 edition onward.{{sfnm|1a1=Hale|1y=2011|1p=92|2a1=Senholt|2y=2012|2p=157}} The editors of ''Tyr'' gave the term political overtones which were not present in Michell's original usage of the term.{{sfn|Senholt|2012|p=157}} Hale believed that through Radical Traditionalism and the New Right Mitchell's writings have been brought to "a whole new audience" where they have a "surprisingly different sort of relevance."{{sfn|Hale|2011|p=95}}

'''Knut Helle''' (19 December 1930 – 27 June 2015) was a Norwegian [[historian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/dodsfall/Nekrolog-Knut-Helle-8085248.html|title=Nekrolog: Knut Helle|date=6 July 2015|publisher=[[Aftenposten]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A professor at the [[University of Bergen]] from 1973 to 2000, he specialized in the [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] [[history of Norway]]. He has contributed to several large works.

==Early life, education and marriage==
He was born in [[Larvik]] as the son of school inspector Hermann Olai Helle (1893–1973) and teacher Berta Marie Malm (1906–1991).&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2001|title=Knut Helle|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Ottar|last=Dahl|authorlink=Ottar Dahl|volume=4|editor=Helle, Knut|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Knut_Helle/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the older brother of politician [[Ingvar Lars Helle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Ingvar Lars Helle|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Ingvar_Lars_Helle|language=Norwegian|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Hetland]] when Knut Helle was seventeen years old.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

He took the [[examen artium]] in [[Stavanger]] in 1949, and a teacher's education in [[Kristiansand]] in 1952. He studied philology in [[University of Oslo|Oslo]] and [[University of Bergen|Bergen]], and graduated with the [[cand.philol.]] degree in 1957. His paper ''Omkring Bǫglungasǫgur'', on the [[Bagler sagas]], was printed in 1959. In December 1957 he married Karen Blauuw, who would later become a professor. Helle's marriage to Blauuw was dissolved in 1985. In October 1987 Helle got married to museum director and professor of medieval archaeology Ingvild Øye.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; They reside in Bergen.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

'''Maní''', a [[Tupí people|Tupí]] [[myth of origins]], is the name of an indigenous girl with very fair complexion. The [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] [[legend]] of Maní is related to the cult of [[Cassava|Manioc]], the native staple food that sprang from her grave.

==The legend==
The daughter of a Tupí chief became pregnant. Her father wanted to take revenge on the man who brought shame to his family and dishonour to his pride despite her saying that she had known no man. He insisted that she revealed the name of the man and even made use of prayers, threats and finally severe punishments. As she refused to say, her father held her prisoner inside a hut and decided to kill her. So with this thought in mind the chief of the tribe went to sleep and dreamed of a white-skinned man dressed like a warrior who told him that his daughter was telling him the truth and that she had not had any contact with any man. He told him to take care of his daughter because one day she was going to bear a great gift for all his tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Livia de Almeida, Ana Portella, Margaret Read MacDonald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BmShpbrZCYkC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=Mani+brazilian+folklore&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=72lg8g5tgl&amp;sig=UpVP4mu054eeKaitU7cnV6X99eY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XFKOTNCcMYnNswbdlrHmAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mani%20brazilian%20folklore&amp;f=false ''Brazilian folktales''], pg. xi, Libraries Unlimited (2006), {{ISBN|1-56308-930-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nine full moons she gave birth to a girl whose skin was as white as the moon and her eyes as dark as the night. That caused the surprise of not only the entire tribe, but also of the neighboring tribes who came to visit the new born child for they could not believe she was white. Happy and beautiful Maní grew up until after her first birthday, when she died unexpectedly without signs of any illness or pain. The chief was so desolate that he buried the child inside his own hut. Her mother watered her grave every single day, as it was then the custom in her tribe. One day a different kind of plant sprang up from Maní's grave,&lt;ref&gt;Yara Roberts, Richard Roberts, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mLyUZy4dr2kC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=%22Mani+oca%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rrmP5SLfSf&amp;sig=1Fv-cltF0j82oKmSSUE-DIiiODg&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=fr6OTNr4OI6Rswbz9-iWAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mani%20oca%22&amp;f=false The ''Brazilian Table''], pg. 40, Gibbs M. Smith Inc (2009), {{ISBN|1-4236-0315-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as no one had ever seen that kind of plant, they let it grow and no one in the tribe dared touch it. They even noticed that when the birds ate the fruits of the plant, they displayed strange symptoms, as if they were drunk.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;Hartley Burr Alexander, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v1PwvkKge6kC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=Mani+Manioc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=24COTNH4A5HN4Aa3ytjmCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Mani%20Manioc&amp;f=false ''Latin-American [Mythology&amp;#93;''], pg. 186, General Books LLC (2009), {{ISBN|1-150-14877-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime later a crack opened on the earth and the people of the tribe found a fruit that resembled the white skin tone of the dead child's body. They picked up the fruit from the ground, peeled and cooked it, and for their surprise it tasted delicious. It even renewed their strength. They also raspped it and prepared a drink which could easily put one to sleep. So, from this day on, they began using the root as their staple food and called it "mandioca", which in Tupy language means "house (oca, in [[Tupi–Guarani languages|Tupi–Guarani]]) of Mandi= Maní".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mw4.m-w.com/dictionary/manioc |title= ''Definition of Manioc'' |author= Merrian Webster Dictionary |date= |work= First Known Use: circa 1554 
|publisher= mw4.m-w.com|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versions===
Alternative versions for the legend exist. One says that a good spirit came down to Earth and showed the manioc to the Indians, teaching them to extract the evil spirit dwelling in it, despite failing to teach them how the plant might be reproduced. After that, one of the female Indians of the tribe, while wandering through the forest, encountered a beautiful young hunter who was no other than the manioc metamorphosed. He seduced her and a daughter was born from this union. She led the tribe to the plantation of the shrub and taught them how to reproduce it from the fine portions of the stem.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;

A more elaborate version by Couto de Magalhaes tells how the chief of the tribe was about to kill his daughter when a white male warrior appeared in his dream and told him not to do so because his daughter was telling him the truth, and that she really had no contact with any man. The child born to the maiden was a boy who was named Maní.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; At the end of a year, the child perished unexpectedly without showing signs of illness. He was buried and later a strange plant grew upon his grave. The Indians opened the grave and instead of finding the body of the child, discovered a root which they called Mani-oka (House of Mani).&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;

Another version given by Carlos Teschauer says that the child born from the union of the chief's daughter and the white warrior not only lived long, but also taught his tribe many things. He also told them that after a year from his death they should open his grave that the greatest treasure of all, a bread-yielding root, would be then revealed to them.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;

The '''Yat-Sen Suit''', also called the '''Mao suit, Chinese tunic suit''' or '''Zhongshan suit''', is a style of [[Chinese clothing|Chinese]] [[menswear]] associated in [[China]] with [[Sun Yat-sen]] (better known to mainland Chinese as "Sun Zhongshan"), although it is more commonly associated in [[western world|the West]] with [[Mao Zedong]]. 

Sun Yat-sen introduced the style shortly after the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] as a form of [[national dress]] with distinct political symbolism. Following the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, Mao and other leaders continued to wear the garment as a symbol of [[proletariat|proletarian]] unity and as an Eastern counterpart to the [[business suit]]. It became less popular after the [[Opening Up Policy|Opening Up of China]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] but is still commonly worn by Chinese leaders during important state ceremonies and functions.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90785/6775781.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20151007-from-red-guards-to-bond-villains-why-the-mao-suit-endures&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s the Mao suit became fashionable among Western European, Australian, and New Zealander socialists and intellectuals. It was sometimes worn over a [[turtleneck]].

==Origins==
When the Republic was founded in 1912, the style of dress worn in China was based on [[Manchu]] dress (''[[qipao]]'' and ''[[changshan]]''), which had been imposed by the [[Qing Dynasty]] as a form of social control. The majority-[[Han Chinese]] revolutionaries who overthrew the Qing were fueled by failure of the Qing to defend China and a lack of scientific advancement compared to the West. Even before the founding of the Republic, older forms of Chinese dress were becoming unpopular among the elite and led to the development of Chinese dress which combined the changshan and the Western hat to form a new dress. The Zhongshan suit is a similar development which combined Western and Eastern fashions. 

The Zhongshan suit was an attempt to cater to contemporary sensibilities without adopting Western styles wholesale. Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]] was personally involved, providing inputs based on his life experience in [[Japan]]: the Japanese [[cadet]] uniform became a basis of the Zhongshan suit. There were other modifications as well: instead of the three hidden pockets in Western suits, the Zhongshan suit had four outside pockets to adhere to Chinese concepts of balance and symmetry; an inside pocket was also available. Over time, minor stylistic changes developed. The suit originally had seven buttons, later reduced to five.

After repeated attempts to win support and recognition from Western countries failed, the Nationalist Party government in Canton led by Sun gained help (advisers and small arms) from Soviet Russia, which viewed it as a likely revolutionary ally against Western interests in the Far East; Chinese nationalism at the time (of treaty ports and extraterritoriality discriminations) was heavily infected with resentment against the West. As a result of this geopolitical alignment, Sun agreed to permit the nascent Chinese Communist Party to join the Nationalist Party — as individual members — not as a party-party union, combination or alliance. As a result, early Communist Party members adopted the attire as a mark of joining the Nationalist Party. From that practice during an attenuated political marriage of convenience which would soon be divorced in blood (in 1927), Asian [[Marxism|Marxist]] movements and governments henceforth would all consider this attire as a standard of political coloration, and it would continue to be appropriate dress for both sides of the bitter Chinese civil wars lasting decades.

After [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s death in 1925, popular mythology assigned a revolutionary and patriotic significance to the Zhongshan suit. The four pockets were said to represent the [[Four Virtues]] cited in the classic ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'': Propriety, Justice, Honesty, and Shame. The five center-front buttons were said to represent the five Yuans (branches of government)–[[legislation]], [[Regulation|supervision]], [[Inspection|examination]], [[Administration (government)|administration]] and [[jurisdiction]]–cited in the [[constitution of the Republic of China]] and the three cuff-buttons to symbolize Sun Yat-sen's [[Three Principles of the People]]: Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood. Finally, unlike Western-style suits that are usually composed of two layers of cloth, the jacket is in a single piece—symbolizing China's unity and peace.

==Historical development==
In the 1920s and 1930s, civil servants of the Chinese government were required to wear the ''Zhongshan zhuang''. A slightly modified version of the suit, adapted for combat, formed the basis for [[National Revolutionary Army]] [[Army uniforms|uniforms]] leading up through the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], although during the 1930s, as German military advice and assistance to the National Government increased, the formal military uniform in the professional elements and ranks essentially became that of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] and then [[Nazi Germany]] (including the [[Stahlhelm|famous helmet]]). 

After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]], and especially during the long Maoist era culminating with the [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976, the suit came to be widely worn by the entire male population as a symbol of proletarian unity; it was regularly worn by [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] until the 1990s when it was largely replaced by the Western [[business suit]].   

The Mao suit remained the standard formal dress for the [[generations of Chinese leadership|first and second generations of PRC leaders]] such as [[Deng Xiaoping]]. During the 1990s, it began to be worn with decreasing frequency by leaders of [[Jiang Zemin]]'s generation as more and more Chinese politicians began wearing traditional Western-style suits with [[neckties]]. Jiang wore it only on special occasions, such as to state dinners. Hu Jintao still wore the Mao suit, but only on special occasions, such as the ceremony marking the [[60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China|60th anniversary of the People's Republic]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90785/6775781.html "Mao suit continued choice of China's top leaders for National Day ceremony"], Xinhua, 1 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Hu Jintao even showed up to a [[black tie]] state dinner in the United States wearing a business suit, attracting some criticism for being underdressed at a formal occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chow|first1=Jason|title=What to Wear to a State Dinner|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2011/01/20/what-to-wear-to-a-state-dinner/|work=Scene Asia|agency=Wall Street Journal|date=January 20, 2011|quote=But Wednesday night, Chinese President Hu Jintao did not wear a tuxedo. Instead, he opted for a dark suit and conservative blue tie.  On a sartorial level, the Chinese President was shown up by his American counterpart and the first lady. President Obama wore an elegant dinner jacket; his wife, Michelle, a flowing red dress by Alexander McQueen.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macartney|first1=Jane|title=Hu’s lounge suit was wrong on all counts|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/americas/article2881685.ece|agency=The Times (London)|date=January 20, 2011|quote=Hu Jintao should have chosen a beautifully cut Mao suit instead of a blue spotted tie for his first White House state dinner.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Xi Jinping administration, however, the Mao suit made a comeback as a [[diplomatic uniform]] and [[wikt:evening dress|evening dress]].

In [[Taiwan]], the Zhongshan suit was seldom seen after the 1970s.  Moreover, given the subtropical weather much of the year in Taiwan, a modified version which dropped the buttoned-up collar original constriction in favor of a Western-style open dress shirt collar became standard for a time.

==Symbol of national sovereignty==

The Mao suit is worn at the most formal ceremonies as a symbol of national sovereignty.  Chinese [[paramount leader]]s always wear Mao suits for military parades in Beijing, even though the Vice President and other Politburo officials wear Western business suits.  It is customary for Chinese leaders to wear Mao suits when attending [[state dinner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China State Dinners|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/galleries/china-state-dinners|website=The White House Historical Association|accessdate=30 January 2016|quote=Presidents Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon speak with Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping of China during the State Dinner on January 29, 1979.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House State Dinner for the President of China|url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/102997.html|quote=The President and Mrs. Clinton are hosting His Excellency President Jiang Zemin and Madame Wang Yeping at a White House State Dinner on Wednesday, October 29, 1997.

The Mao suit also serves as a [[diplomatic uniform]].  Although Chinese ambassadors usually wear Western business suits, many Chinese ambassadors choose to wear a Mao suit when they present their [[Letter of credence|credentials]] to the head of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.E. Ambassador Zhang Weidong Presents Credentials to the President of Iceland|url=http://is.china-embassy.org/eng/xwdt/t1197299.htm|website=Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Republic of Iceland|date=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ambassador to Sweden Chen Yuming Presents Credentials to His Majesty the King of Sweden|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zwjg_665342/zwbd_665378/t1109701.shtml|website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|date=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ambassador to Iran Pang Sen Presents Credentials to President Hassan Rouhani of Iran|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zwjg_665342/zwbd_665378/t1169220.shtml|website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|date=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The presentation ceremony is symbolic of the [[diplomatic recognition]] that exists between the two countries, so it carries a higher level of formality than other diplomatic meetings.

A '''modello''' {{IPA-it|moˈdɛllo|}} (plural '''modelli'''), from Italian,&lt;ref&gt;The term ''modello'' avoids the ambiguity in English of ''model'', which may equally refer to the finished [[work of art]] that provided detailed inspiration for a variant or later copy.&lt;/ref&gt; is a preparatory study or model, usually at a smaller scale, for a work of art or architecture, especially one produced for the approval of the commissioning patron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Modello Glossary, National Gallery, London]; Irene Earls; [https://books.google.com/books?id=xAdrziNnqLIC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U36ePp8oMeVe0otIfoYZyo8eDz0Yw ''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987, {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained currency in art circles in [[Tuscany]] in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The texts from five contracts and other documents 1376–1508 published by Michael Hirst (Hirst and Carmen Bambach Cappel, "A Note on the Word Modello', ''The Art Bulletin'' '''74'''.1 (March 1992:172–173) are all Tuscan, as Hirst remarks, though the contemporaneous term extended as far as the [[Marche]].&lt;/ref&gt; Modern definitions in reference works vary somewhat. Alternative and overlapping terms are "[[oil sketch]]" (''schizzo'') and "[[cartoon]]" for [[painting]]s or [[stained glass]], [[maquette]], plastico or bozzetto&lt;ref&gt;A ''bozzetto'' is a roughly-modelled preliminary sketch in clay for a sculpture; those that survive have mostly been kiln-fired to preserve them.&lt;/ref&gt; for sculpture or architecture, or [[architectural model]].&lt;ref&gt;Fourteenth century uses of ''modello'' in connection with [[Santa Reparata, Florence]], are noted in A.

Though in Gothic figural arts bishops and abbots are often represented carrying small simulacra&lt;ref&gt;The Latin term ''modulus'', a synonym of ''typus'', "[[archetype]]" is given as source for the usage in the Tusacan [[Accademia della Crusca]]'s early dictionaries; other early dictionary definitions in Italian are noted by Carmen Bambach Cappel 1992:173. See also [[Donor portrait]]&lt;/ref&gt; of buildings they had constructed—"models" in the familiar modern sense—''modello'' is only used of pieces which pre-date the finished work, and were at least in part produced by the main artist involved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michelangelo]] was in the habit of assigning to members of his studio ''modelli'' done to his specifications: "in Michelagelo studies the presentation drawings are understood to be the group of finished drawings that Michelangelo gave to his friends such as [[Tommaso de' Cavallieri]]", remarked Bernadine Barnes (Barnes "A Lost Modello for Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment'" ''Master Drawings'' '''26'''.3 (Autumn 1988:239–248) p. 247 note 4) in justifying her use of ''modello'' for the lost original of two copies in public collections. In the case of architectural ''modelli'', the actual construction could be by craftsmen from drawings by the architect. A discussion about a [[Hieronymous Bosch]] drawing that illustrates when the term is appropriate to use is in [https://books.google.com/books?id=JIb45zQG-o4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U27JzKo-RkzM5KkC7v3NlImFkIOig#PPA73,M1 note 23 on page 21] of: J.O. Hand &amp; M. Wolff, ''Early Netherlandish Painting'', National Gallery of Art, Washington catalogue (Cambridge UP), 1986, {{ISBN|0-521-34016-0}}; the correspondence concerning the appropriateness or not of ''modello'' applied by Michael Hirst to presentation drawings by [[Michelangelo]] that were "done expressly for patronal approval, criticism or rejection" (Hirst, ''Michelangelo and His Drawings'', 1988:79) is noted above.&lt;/ref&gt; The&lt;span id="Ricordo" &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- The preceding heading-less link-target is linked to by [[Ricordi]] and [[Ricordo]] --&gt; less frequently found term '''ricordo''' (Italian for "record" or "memory") means a similar piece produced as a small copy ''after'' completion of the work as a record for the workshop.&lt;ref&gt;A small finished bronze representing a completed sculpture on a reduced scale, made for a [[connoisseur]] or the art market, is a ''reduction''.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally it is not always easy for art historians to decide whether a particular piece is one or the other, and, especially in the Late Renaissance and Baroque periods, when several versions of a painting were made, the ''ricordo'' for the [[prime version]] might serve in the atelier as the ''modello'' for the subsequent ones.&lt;ref&gt;See: Jonathan Brown, Richard G. Mann; ''Spanish Paintings of the Fifteenth Through Nineteenth Centuries: The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue'', National Gallery of Art, Oxford University Press US, 1990, {{ISBN|0-521-40107-0}}. In the [https://books.google.com/books?id=JIb45zQG-o4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U27JzKo-RkzM5KkC7v3NlImFkIOig#PPA73,M1 last paragraph of p.73], the view is advanced that an [[El Greco]] was produced as a ''ricordo'' for the first version of a work, and then used as the ''modello'' for a second version.&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt a modello was often modified after the main work was completed to reflect any changes in the composition during painting, thus making it a ricordo also; this would normally be impossible for art historians to distinguish from a modello altered during its original production. 

The [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] at right was catalogued as a modello by [[Michael Levey]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]], ''The 17th and 18th century Italian Schools; National Gallery Catalogues'', p.223, 1971, National Gallery, London, {{ISBN|0-901791-09-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recent [[x-ray]] investigation of the huge finished work in Munich has revealed that in its [[underpainting]] it was closer to another, very different and less finished modello, now in the [[Courtauld Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;Braham Helen, ''The Princes Gate Collection'', p. 74, Courtauld Institute Galleries, London 1981, {{ISBN|0-904563-04-9}} [http://www.courtauldprints.com/image.php?id=147902&amp;idx=1&amp;fromsearch=true Courtauld Institute image] – note this is reversed compared to the final painting.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been asserted that the National Gallery picture illustrated is a ricordo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886961 Francisco Bayeu.

JSTOR – on free page&lt;/ref&gt; The National Gallery still describe it as "probably a modello", presumably produced after work had already begun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng6273 National Gallery, London]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ghiberticompetition.jpg|thumb|left|''Sacrifice of Isaac''; [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s successful competition modello for the bronze doors of the [[Florence Baptistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare with [http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Brunelleschi%20Filippo/imagepages/image2.html Brunelleschi's unsuccessful version]. Both are in the [[Bargello]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
"Cartoon", named for the sturdy ''cartone'' paper on which they were generally executed, is usually used of working drawings, often at full scale,&lt;ref&gt;Cartoons for [[tapestry]] were always at full scale; often cut into loom-width strips, they were set behind the warps of the loom as a direct guide for the weavers. The most famous tapestry cartoons are the "[[Raphael Cartoons]]" conserved in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]; they were re-used in the 17th century in England to produce series of [[Mortlake|Mortlake tapestries]].&lt;/ref&gt; but the distinction is not a firm one, and the terms ''cartoon'' and ''working drawing'' are often used interchangeably. ''Modello'' is especially used of older Italian art and architecture from the late Middle Ages onwards; initially these were mostly drawings, perhaps with some colour from chalk or [[watercolour]], or with colours indicated in writing. The diminutive term '''modeletto''' will always be used of small-scale versions. As an Italian word, ''modello'' may be printed in [[italic type|italic]]s, or not.&lt;ref&gt;Surprisingly, the word does not appear in the original ''[[OED]]'' or the First Supplement of 1933&lt;/ref&gt; The French version of the word, ''modèle'', may be used of French works, and is normally italicised.

Especially in the case of oil sketches, many ''modelli'' are greatly valued in their own right, as they may show a freedom in execution and freshness of inspiration missing in the final work, and also may show changes in composition from the finished work, throwing light on the process of artistic creation. Earlier stages of the creative process may be recorded in "preparatory drawings" or "studies", either for the whole composition, or a part of it, such as a single figure.

[[File:Passignano Michelangelo che da il modellino di San Pietro a Paolo IV.jpg|thumb|[[Michelangelo]] shows [[Pope Julius II]] his ''modellino'' of St Peter's in this 19th-century artist's impression]]
An example of a modello of a fresco cycle, which was rescued for its intrinsic value is in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of [[Rosso Fiorentino]]: Vasari reports that a modello for Rosso's frescoes in Santa Maria delle Lagrime, Arezzo, was carried out by Rosso for Giovanni Pollastra, the inventor of the complex program there, "un bellisimo modello di tutto l'opera, che è oggi nelle nostre case di Arezzo."&lt;ref&gt;"A most beautiful ''modello'' of all the works, which is today in our houses in Arezzo."&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary ''modello colorito'' in the form of a painted three-dimensional model was especially important to prejudge the finished effect of [[Illusionistic ceiling|illusionistic ''sotto-in-su'' perspectives]] on the curved surfaces of vaulted ceilings, as [[Andrea Pozzo]], the perfector of the illusionistic ceiling, noted in his ''Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum'' (1700–17)&lt;ref&gt;In vol. II, section "Breve instruttione per dipingere a fresco", noted by Carmen Bambach Cappel, ''loc. cit.''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many modelli show versions of works which were never actually realised, or have been lost. Famous examples are the alternative designs produced for the competition in 1401 to design the North doors of the [[Florence Baptistry]]. [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] won, beating six other artists, including [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and [[Jacopo della Quercia]]; the modelli survive, for a single panel, of the first two named ([[Bargello]] – picture above).

There are alternative, unrealised, modelli for many famous buildings, including [[St Peter's, Rome]] and the "Great Model" of [[St Paul's Cathedral, London]], showing a different design by [[Sir Christopher Wren]] from that actually built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.explore-stpauls.net/oct03/textMM/TriforumGreatModelN.htm Explore St Paul's – Wren's Great Model]&lt;/ref&gt; When accepted, such models were retained during the work, as concrete expressions of what was expected under the terms of the contract, and afterwards were preserved in storage through salutary neglect.

Schmidt|Reinhold Schmidt]], [[Howard Menger]], and Stephen Darbishire.]]

In [[Ufology]], [[conspiracy theory]], [[science fiction]], and [[comic book]] stories, claims or stories have circulated linking [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s to [[Nazi Germany]]. The German UFO theories describe supposedly successful attempts to develop advanced aircraft or spacecraft prior to and during [[World War II]], and further assert the post-war survival of these craft in secret underground bases in [[New Swabia|Antarctica]], South America, or the United States, along with their creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Goodrick-Clarke | first = Nicholas | year= 2002| title= Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity| publisher = New York University Press| isbn=0-8147-3124-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these theories and fictional stories, various potential code-names or sub-classifications of Nazi UFO craft such as ''Rundflugzeug'', ''Feuerball'', ''Diskus'', ''Haunebu'', ''Hauneburg-Gerät'', ''V7'', ''[[Vril]]'', ''Kugelblitz'' (not related to the [[Kugelblitz|self-propelled anti-aircraft gun of the same name]]), ''Andromeda-Gerät'', ''Flugkreisel'', ''Kugelwaffe'', and ''Reichsflugscheibe'' have all been referenced.

Accounts appear as early as 1950, likely inspired by historical German development of specialized engines such as [[Viktor Schauberger]]'s "Repulsine" around the time of World War II. Elements of these claims have been widely incorporated into various works of fictional and purportedly non-fictional media, including video games and documentaries, often mixed with more substantiated information.

German UFO literature very often conforms largely to documented history on the following points:

* Nazi Germany claimed the territory of [[New Swabia]] in [[Antarctica]], sent an expedition there in 1938, and planned others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Journals | publisher = Cambridge | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=B6356AB01A1A845DF9DE9BBF66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nazi Germany conducted research into advanced propulsion technology, including [[rocket]]ry, Viktor Schauberger's engine research, [[Horten Ho 229|flying wing craft]] and the [[Sack AS-6|Arthur Sack A.S.6]] experimental circular winged aircraft.
* Some UFO sightings during [[World War II]], particularly those known as [[foo fighter]]s, were thought by the Allies to be prototype enemy aircraft designed to harass [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft through electromagnetic disruption; a technology similar to today's [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) weapons.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Early claims==
In World War II, the so-called "[[foo fighter]]s", a variety of unusual and anomalous aerial phenomena, were witnessed by both Axis and Allied personnel. While some foo fighter reports were dismissed as the misperceptions of troops in the heat of combat, others were taken seriously, and leading scientists such as [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] began to investigate them.{{Sfn | Chester | 2007}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = April 2013}}  In at least some cases, Allied intelligence and commanders suspected that foo fighters reported in the European theater represented advanced German aircraft or weapons, particularly given that Germans had already developed such technological innovations as [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] rockets and the first operational jet-powered [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] fighter planes, and that a minority of foo fighters seemed to have inflicted damage to allied aircraft.{{Sfn | Chester | 2007}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = April 2013}}

Similar sentiments regarding German technology resurfaced in 1947 with the first wave of flying saucer reports after [[Kenneth Arnold]]'s widely reported close encounter with nine crescent-shaped objects moving at a high velocity. Personnel of [[Project Sign]], the first U.S. Air Force UFO investigation group, noted that the advanced [[flying wing]] aeronautical designs of the German [[Horten brothers]] were similar to some UFO reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Michael D. Swords| last = Swords | first = Michael D | contribution = UFOs, the Military, and the Early Cold War | pages = 82–122 | title = UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge | editor-first = David M | editor-last = Jacobs | publisher = University Press of Kansas | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]], the first head of [[Project Blue Book]] (Project Sign's follow-up investigation) wrote:
{{Quote |When WWII ended, the Germans had several radical types of aircraft and guided missiles under development. The majority were in the most preliminary stages, but they were the only known craft that could even approach the performance of objects reported by UFO observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Childress| first1 = David Hatcher | last2 = Shaver | first2 = Richard S | title= Lost Continents &amp; the Hollow Earth | quote = Nazi UFOs are misconceptions (recorded proof) of Zeppelins flying over the sea side of Germany | isbn = 0-932813-63-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While these early speculations and reports were limited primarily to military personnel, the earliest assertion of German flying saucers in the [[mass media]] appears to have been an article which appeared in the Italian newspaper ''[[Il Giornale d'Italia]]'' in early 1950. Written by Professor [[Giuseppe Belluzzo]], an Italian scientist and a former Italian Minister of National Economy under the Mussolini regime, it claimed that "types of flying discs were designed and studied in Germany and Italy as early as 1942". Belluzzo also expressed the opinion that "some great power is launching discs to study them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Flying Discs 'Old Story', Says Italian | newspaper = [[Daily Mirror]] | date = 24 March 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Die Glocke|Bell UFO]] was among the first flying objects to be connected with the Nazis.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} It apparently had occult markings on it and it was also rumoured to have been very similar to a Wehrmacht document about a vertical take off aircraft. It is directly related to the [[Kecksburg UFO incident|supposed crash of a bell-shaped object that occurred in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, USA on December 9, 1965]]. The same month, German engineer [[Rudolf Schriever]] gave an interview to German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in which he claimed that he had designed a craft powered by a circular plane of rotating turbine blades {{convert |49|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter. He said that the project had been developed by him and his team at [[BMW]]'s Prague works until April 1945, when he fled [[Czechoslovakia]]. His designs for the disk and a model were stolen from his workshop in Bremerhaven-Lehe in 1948 and he was convinced that Czech agents had built his craft for "a foreign power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=1950-03-31| title=Luftfahrt| work=Der Spiegel| url=http://www.naziufos.com/NEWSCL/SCHRIEV.HTM| accessdate=2006-12-01| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211214416/http://www.naziufos.com/NEWSCL/SCHRIEV.HTM| archivedate=2006-12-11| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unmuseum.org/germufo.htm |title=Nazi Flying Saucers |publisher=The UnMuseum | accessdate = 2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate interview with ''Der Spiegel'' in October 1952 he said that the plans were stolen from a farm he was hiding in near [[Regen]] on 14 May 1945. There are other discrepancies between the two interviews that add to the confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first =Brad | last = Turner |url= http://www.german-discs.net/builders/schriever.php |title=Rudolf Schriever |publisher=German Discs | accessdate= 2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many skeptics have doubted that such a Bell UFO was actually designed or ever built.&lt;ref name=secret&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/hitler-s-stealth-fighter-3942/nazi-secret-weapons-1#ixzz0uXSU8IRo|publisher=[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]|first=Patrick J|last=Kiger|title=Nazi Secret Weapons|accessdate=July 23, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226104846/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/hitler-s-stealth-fighter-3942/nazi-secret-weapons-1#ixzz0uXSU8IRo|archivedate=February 26, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, when [[Avro Canada]] announced that it was developing the VZ-9-AV [[Avrocar]], a circular jet aircraft with an estimated speed of {{convert |1500|mph|abbr =on}}, German engineer Georg Klein claimed that such designs had been developed during the Nazi era. Klein identified two types of supposed German flying disks:

* A non-rotating disk developed at [[Breslau]] by [[V-2 rocket]] engineer Richard Miethe, which was captured by the Soviets, while Miethe fled to the US via France, and ended up working for Avro.
* A disk developed by Rudolf Schriever and Klaus Habermohl at Prague, which consisted of a ring of moving turbine blades around a fixed cockpit. Klein claimed that he had witnessed this craft's first manned flight on 14 February 1945, when it managed to climb to {{convert |12400|m|abbr =on}} in 3 minutes and attained a speed of {{convert|2200|km/h|abbr=on}} in level flight.

Aeronautical engineer [[Roy Fedden]] remarked that the only craft that could approach the capabilities attributed to flying saucers were those being designed by the Germans towards the end of the war. Fedden (who was also chief of the technical mission to Germany for the Ministry of Aircraft Production) stated in 1945: {{quote|I have seen enough of their designs and production plans to realize that if they (the Germans) had managed to prolong the war some months longer, we would have been confronted with a set of entirely new and deadly developments in air warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burlingtonnews.net/hitlersufo.html Hitler's UFO, Burlington UFO and Paranormal Research and Educational Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fedden also added that the Germans were working on a number of very unusual aeronautical projects, though he did not elaborate upon his statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

==Later claims==

===''The Morning of the Magicians''===
''Le Matin des Magiciens'' ("[[The Morning of the Magicians]]"), a 1960 book by [[Louis Pauwels]] and [[Jacques Bergier]], made many spectacular claims about the [[Vril Society]] of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| language = German | last1 = Pauwels | first1 = Louis | year = 1967| first2 = Jacques | last2 = Bergier |title= Aufbruch ins dritte Jahrtausend: Von der Zukunft der phantastischen Vernunft| isbn=3-442-11711-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later writers, including [[Jan van Helsing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| language = German | last=Van Helsing| first=Jan| year= 1993| title = Geheimgesellschaften und ihre Macht im 20. Jahrhundert| publisher=Ewert| location=Rhede, Emsland| isbn = 3-89478-069-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| language = German | last=Van Helsing| first=Jan| year=1997| title = Unternehmen Aldebaran.

Der Endkampf um die Erde | publisher = self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vladimir Terziski]], have built on their work, connecting the Vril Society with UFOs. Among their claims, they imply that the society may have made contact with an alien race and dedicated itself to creating spacecraft to reach the aliens. In partnership with the [[Thule Society]] and the [[Nazi Party]], the Vril Society developed a series of flying disc prototypes. With the Nazi defeat, the society allegedly retreated to a base in Antarctica and vanished into the hollow Earth to meet up with the leaders of an advanced race inhabiting inner Earth.

===Ernst Zündel's marketing ploy===
{{Further|Ernst Zündel#UFOlogy}}
When German [[Holocaust denier]] [[Ernst Zündel]] started [[Samisdat Publishers]] in the 1970s, he initially catered to the [[UFOlogy]] community, which was then at its peak of public acceptance. His books claimed that flying saucers were Nazi secret weapons launched from an underground base in Antarctica, from which the Nazis hoped to conquer the Earth and possibly the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Friedrich| first= Christof| year = 1974 | authorlink =Ernst Zündel| title=UFOs – Nazi Secret Weapon?| publisher=Samisdat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zündel also sold (for $9999) seats on an exploration team to locate the polar entrance to the [[hollow earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/z/zundel-ernst/flying-saucers/expedition.html | accessdate = 2006-08-27 | last = Friedrich | first=Christof| orig-year= 1974| title= Samisdat Hollow Earth Expedition | year = 1979| work= The Nizkor Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some who interviewed Zündel claim that he privately admitted it was a deliberate hoax to build publicity for Samisdat, although he still defended it as late as 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/z/zundel-ernst/flying-saucers/ | accessdate = 2006-08-27 | title = Ernst Zündel's Flying Saucers | work = The Nizkor Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/z/zundel.ernst/zundelgrams/ftp.py?people/z/zundel.ernst/zundelgrams//2002/zgram.021201 | accessdate = 2006-08-27 | last = Zündel | first= Ernst | title=Zündelgram| date=2002-12-01| work=The Nizkor Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miguel Serrano's book===
In 1978, [[Miguel Serrano]], a [[Chile]]an diplomat and Nazi sympathizer, published {{Citation | language = Spanish| title = El Cordón Dorado: Hitlerismo Esotérico |trans-title=The Golden Thread: Esoteric Hitlerism}}, in which he claimed that [[Adolf Hitler]] was an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] and was, at that time, communing with [[Hyperborean]] gods in an underground Antarctic base in [[New Swabia]]. Serrano predicted that Hitler would lead a fleet of UFOs from the base to establish the [[Fourth Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | language = German | last = Serrano| first=Miguel| year= 1978| title= Das goldene Band: esoterischer Hitlerismus |trans-title=The Golden Thread: Esoteric Hitlerism | isbn = 3-926179-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[popular culture]], this alleged UFO fleet is referred to as the ''Nazi flying saucers from Antarctica''.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=October 2015}}

===Richard Chase===
According to a 1979 interview conducted by FBI agent [[Robert Ressler]], imprisoned [[serial killer]] [[Richard Chase]] believed or claimed to believe due to his schizophrenia that Nazi UFOs had extorted him into committing his murders under threat to his own life. Chase further claimed that prison officials in league with the Nazis were poisoning his food, and he asked Ressler to provide him with a radar gun, with which he could apprehend his enemies. On December 26, 1980, Chase was found dead in his cell. An autopsy found that he committed suicide with an overdose of prescribed antidepressants that he had saved over several weeks.

==In popular culture==
* In 1947, [[Robert A. Heinlein]] published ''[[Rocket Ship Galileo]]'', a science fiction novel featuring a German moon base.
* ''[[Iron Sky]]'' (2012): a [[science fiction]] [[black comedy]] about Nazis who left Earth from their hidden base in Antarctica and established a secret fortress on the [[Far side of the Moon|dark side of the Moon]]. After Germany's defeat in 1945, the Nazis vowed to return to Earth "in peace," and they finally return in the year 2018, but with a full invasion force of flying saucers in order to finally defeat the Allies and restore [[Nazi Germany]]. During their invasion, they end up battling with the [[President of the United States]] (who in the film resembles [[Sarah Palin]]) and unintentionally cause a worldwide nuclear war when every space-faring nation on Earth lays claim to the Nazis' powerful [[Helium-3]] resources on the Moon. 
* ''[[Iron Sky: Invasion]]'' (2012): a video game [[space combat simulator]] and an expansion of [[Iron Sky|the 2012 movie]], with interactive and flyable recreations of numerous alleged prototypes and models of Nazi UFO spacecraft.
*''[[Iron Sky: The Coming Race]]'' is an upcoming Finnish-German [[comic science fiction]] [[action film]] directed by [[Timo Vuorensola]], a sequel to Vuorensola's earlier ''Iron Sky''. The film is currently being [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] through [[Indiegogo]] and is aiming for a 2018 release.&lt;ref name="Indiegogo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/iron-sky-the-coming-race--2#home |title=''Iron Sky: The Coming Race'' |publisher=[[Indiegogo]] |accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major inspiration of the content (and the title) appears to be the Vril Society.
* [[Robert Rankin]]'s novel ''[[Nostradamus Ate My Hamster]]'' features Hitler and a group of Nazis escaping the end of the war to the future in a time machine; they attempt the subtle takeover of Earth through media manipulation until their time machine is used against them.
* [[Francisco Ortega (writer)|Francisco Ortega]]'s novel ''El Verbo Kaifman'' (Kaifman Verb) (2014), describes a Nazi Haunebu UFO found by the main character, Paul Kaifman. The craft is described as a copy of a [[Vimana]] and is later used by Paul to travel through time.
* The [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] program [[Ancient Aliens]] has featured episodes about Nazi UFOs and Nazi UFO conspiracy theories.
* ''[[Unsealed Alien Files]]'' claims that Nazi technological advances came from alien technology stolen from a crashed UFO and the possibility of their own UFOs.
*In ''[[Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus]]'' UFOs are used by the Nazi regime as a form of space travel, and the resistance successfully manages to steal one of them when they sent Blazkowicz to [[Venus]].

'''Objectivity''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept of being [[wikt:true|true]] independently from [[subject (philosophy)|individual]] [[subjectivity]] caused by perception, emotions, or imagination. A proposition is considered to have '''objective truth''' when its truth conditions are met without bias caused by a [[sentience|sentient]] subject. [[Objectivity (science)|Scientific objectivity]] refers to the ability to judge without partiality or external influence, sometimes used synonymously with ''[[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]''.

== Objectivity of knowledge ==
&lt;!-- 'Rhetorical situation' points here --&gt;
[[Plato]] considered [[geometry]] a condition of [[Platonic idealism|idealism]] concerned with [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] truth. His contrasting between objectivity and [[doxa|opinion]] became the basis for philosophies intent on resolving the questions of [[reality]], [[truth]], and [[existence]]. He saw opinions as belonging to the shifting sphere of [[sensibility|sensibilities]], as opposed to a fixed, eternal and knowable [[incorporeality]]. Where Plato distinguished between [[epistemology|how we know things]] and their [[ontology|ontological]] status, [[subjectivism]] such as [[George Berkeley]]'s depends on [[perception]]. In [[Platonism|Platonic]] terms, a criticism of subjectivism is that it is difficult to distinguish between knowledge, opinions, and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] knowledge.

Platonic idealism is a form of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] objectivism, holding that the [[idealism|ideas exist independently]] from the individual. Berkeley's [[empiricism|empirical]] idealism, on the other hand, holds that [[subjectivism|things only exist as they are perceived]]. Both approaches boast an attempt at objectivity. Plato's definition of objectivity can be found in [[Platonic epistemology|his epistemology]], which is based on [[mathematics]], and [[Universal_(metaphysics)#Platonic_realism|his metaphysics]], where knowledge of the ontological status of objects and ideas is resistant to change.

In opposition to philosopher [[René Descartes]]' method of [[Cogito, ergo sum|personal deduction]], natural philosopher [[Isaac Newton]] applied the relatively objective [[scientific method]] to look for [[scientific evidence|evidence]] before forming a hypothesis. Partially in response to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[rationalism]], logician [[Gottlob Frege]] applied objectivity to his epistemological and metaphysical philosophies. If reality exists independently of [[consciousness]], then it would logically include a plurality of [[intension|indescribable]] forms. Objectivity requires a definition of [[truth]] formed by propositions with [[truth value]]. An attempt of forming an objective [[world view|construct]] incorporates [[ontological commitment]]s to the reality of objects.

The importance of perception in evaluating and understanding objective reality is debated in the [[Observer_effect_(physics)#Quantum_mechanics|observer effect]] of quantum mechanics. [[Direct and indirect realism|Direct]] or [[Naïve realism|naïve realist]]s rely on perception as key in observing objective reality, while [[instrumentalism|instrumentalists]] hold that observations are useful in predicting objective reality. The concepts that encompass these ideas are important in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[philosophy of mind|Philosophies of mind]] explore whether objectivity relies on [[Consensus reality|perceptual constancy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tyler Burge]], ''Origins of Objectivity'', Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectivity in ethics==

===Ethical subjectivism===
{{See also|David Hume|Non-cognitivism|Subjectivism}}
The term, "ethical subjectivism", covers two distinct theories in ethics. According to cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, the truth of moral statements depends upon people's values, attitudes, feelings, or beliefs. Some forms of cognitivist ethical subjectivism can be counted as forms of realism, others are forms of anti-realism. David Hume is a foundational figure for cognitive ethical subjectivism. On a standard interpretation of his theory, a trait of character counts as a moral virtue when it evokes a sentiment of approbation in a sympathetic, informed, and rational human observer. Similarly, Roderick Firth's [[ideal observer theory]] held that right acts are those that an impartial, rational observer would approve of. William James, another ethical subjectivist, held that an end is good (to or for a person) just in the case it is desired by that person (see also [[ethical egoism]]). According to non-cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, such as emotivism, prescriptivism, and expressivism, ethical statements cannot be true or false, at all: rather, they are expressions of personal feelings or commands. For example, on [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer's]] emotivism, the statement, "Murder is wrong" is equivalent in meaning to the emotive, "Murder, Boo!"

===Ethical objectivism===
{{Main|Moral realism}}
According to the ethical objectivist, the [[truth]] or falsehood of typical moral judgments does not depend upon the beliefs or feelings of any person or group of persons. This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about chemistry, biology, or history, in so much as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false—no matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels.

There are many versions of ethical objectivism, including various religious views of morality, Platonistic intuitionism, [[Kantianism]], [[utilitarianism]], and certain forms of [[ethical egoism]] and [[contractualism]]. Note that Platonists define ethical objectivism in an even more narrow way, so that it requires the existence of intrinsic value. Consequently, they reject the idea that contractualists or egoists could be ethical objectivists. Objectivism, in turn, places primacy on the origin of the frame of reference—and, as such, considers any arbitrary frame of reference ultimately a form of ethical subjectivism by a transitive property, even when the frame incidentally coincides with reality and can be used for measurements.

{{Campaignbox South African Border War}}

'''Operation Savannah''' was the [[South African Defence Force]]'s 1975–1976 covert intervention in the [[Angolan War of Independence]], and the subsequent [[Angolan Civil War]].

==Background==
{{Main|Angolan War of Independence|Angolan Civil War|Cuba in Angola}}
The so-called "[[Carnation Revolution]]" of the 25th April 1974 ended [[Portugal]]'s colonial government, but Angola's three main independence forces, [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA), National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]) and the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]) began competing for dominance in the country.

Fighting began in November 1974, starting in the capital city, [[Luanda]], and spreading quickly across all of Angola, which was soon divided among the combatants. The FNLA occupied northern Angola and UNITA the central south, while the MPLA mostly occupied the coastline, the far south-east and, after capturing it in November 1974, [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]]. Negotiations for independence resulted in the Treaty of [[Alvor Agreement|Alvor]] being signed on 15 January 1975, naming the date of official independence as 11 November 1975. The agreement ended the [[Angolan War of Independence|war for independence]] but marked the escalation of the [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]]. Two dissenting groups, the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]] and the [[Eastern Revolt]], never signed the accords, as they were excluded from negotiations. The coalition government established by the Treaty of Alvor soon ended as nationalist factions, doubting one another's intentions, tried to control the country by force.
&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite book|last=Tvedten|first=Inge|year=1997|title=Angola: Struggle for Peace and Reconstruction|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=d&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneidman|first=Witney Wright|year=2004|title=Engaging Africa: Washington and the Fall of Portugal's Colonial Empire|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fighting between the three forces resumed in Luanda hardly a day after the transitional government assumed office on 15 January 1975.&lt;ref name=George_50-59&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=Edward|title=The Cuban intervention in Angola: 1965–1991|date=2005|publisher=Frank Cass|location=London|isbn=0415350158|pages=50–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies: http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ao0044)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'', The University of North Carolina Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=borderstrike/&gt;

The liberation forces sought to seize strategic points, most importantly the capital, by the official day of independence. The MPLA managed to seize Luanda from the FLNA whilst UNITA retreated from the capital. By March 1975, the FNLA was driving towards Luanda from the north, joined by units of the [[Zaire|Zairian]] army which the [[United States]] had encouraged Zaire to provide.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, W.: ''In Search of Enemies: A CIA Story'', New York, 1978, quoted in: Smith, Wayne: A Trap in Angola in: ''Foreign Policy'' No. 62, Spring 1986, p. 67, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 28 April and early May, 1,200 Zairian troops crossed into northern Angola to assist the FNLA.

&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The FNLA eliminated all remaining MPLA presence in the northern provinces and assumed positions east of [[Kifangondo]] on the eastern outskirts of Luanda, from where it continued to encroach on the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies: http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ao0046)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Wayne: A Trap in Angola in: ''Foreign Policy'' No. 62, Spring 1986, p. 68 and 70, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&lt;/ref&gt; The situation for the MPLA in Luanda became increasingly precarious.&lt;ref name=borderstrike/&gt;

The MPLA received supplies from the [[Soviet Union]] and repeatedly requested 100 officers for military training from [[Cuba]]. Until late August, Cuba had a few technical advisors deployed in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;CIA, National Intelligence Daily, October 11, 1975, p. 4, NSA&lt;/ref&gt; By 9 July, the MPLA gained control of the capital, Luanda.

Starting 21 August, Cuba established four training facilities (CIR) with almost 500 men, which were to train about 4,800 FAPLA recruits in three to six months.&lt;ref&gt;CIA, National Intelligence Daily, October 11, 1975, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was expected to be short-term and to last about 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;
The CIR in [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] accounted for 191 instructors, while [[Benguela]], Saurimo (formerly Henrique de Carvalho) and at N'Dalatando (formerly Salazar) had 66 or 67 instructors each. Some were posted in headquarters in Luanda or in other places throughout the country. The training centres were operational by 18–20 October.&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military intervention==
[[File:OpSavannah1.jpg|thumb|left|South African [[Eland Mk7|Eland]] armoured cars in a forward staging area just prior to Operation Savannah.]]
[[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) involvement in Angola, part of the interrelated [[South African Border War]], started in 1966 when the South West African People's Organization ([[SWAPO]]) commenced an armed struggle for Namibian independence. SWAPO officials founded an armed wing, the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), which operated from bases in [[Zambia]] and rural [[Ovamboland]].&lt;ref name=borderstrike/&gt;&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies: http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ao0047)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the loss of the Portuguese colonial administration as an ally and the possibility of new regimes sympathetic to SWAPO in Lisbon's former colonies, Pretoria recognised that it would lose a valued ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' between South West Africa and the [[Frontline States]].&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Stührenberg, Michael in: ''Die Zeit'' 17/1988, Die Schlacht am Ende der Welt, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press) p. 273-276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Leopold Scholtz: ''The Namibian Border War'' (Stellenbosch University)&lt;/ref&gt; PLAN could seek sanctuary in Angola, and South Africa would be faced with another hostile regime and potentially militarised border to cross in pursuit of Namibian guerrillas.

With both the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] arming major factions in the Angolan Civil War, the conflict escalated into a major [[Cold War]] battleground. South Africa offered advisory and technical assistance to [[UNITA]], while a number of Cuban combat troops entered the country to fight alongside the Marxist [[MPLA]]. Moscow also plied its Angolan clients with heavy weapons. American aid to UNITA and the FNLA was initially undertaken with [[Operation IA Feature]], but this was terminated by the [[Clark Amendment]] in October 1976. Aid would not yet return until after the repeal of the Clark Amendment in 1985.&lt;ref name=trade&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/trade_register.php |title=Trade Registers |publisher=Armstrade.sipri.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; China subsequently recalled its military advisers from Zaire, ending its tacit support for the FNLA.&lt;ref name=e&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanhimaki|first=Jussi M.|year=2004|title=The Flawed Architect: Henry Kissinger and American Foreign Policy|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban instructors began training PLAN in Zambia in April 1975, and the movement had 3,000 new recruits by April. Guerrilla activity intensified, election boycotts were staged in Ovamboland, and the Ovambo Chief Minister assassinated. South Africa responded by calling up more reservists and placing existing security forces along the border on standby. Raids into Angola became commonplace after July 15.&lt;ref name="Wars"&gt;Modern African Wars (3) : South-West Africa (Men-At-Arms Series, 242) by [[Helmoed-Römer Heitman]] (Author), Paul Hannon (Illustrator) Osprey Publishing (28 November 1991) {{ISBN|1-85532-122-X}} and {{ISBN|978-1-85532-122-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for UNITA and FNLA===
Consequently, with the covert assistance of the United States through the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), it began assisting UNITA and the FNLA in a bid to ensure that a neutral or friendly government in Luanda prevailed.&lt;ref name=borderstrike/&gt; On 14 July 1975, South African Prime Minister [[Balthazar Johannes Vorster|Balthazar Vorster]] approved weapons worth US $14 million to be bought secretly for FNLA and UNITA.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press) quoting: Spies, F. J. du Toit in: Operasie Savannah. Angola 1975–1976, Pretoria, p. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press) quoting: Deon Geldenhuys in: ''The Diplomacy of Isolation: South African Foreign Policy Making'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; of which the first shipments from South Africa arrived in August 1975.

===Ruacana-Calueque occupation===
On 9 August 1975 a 30-man SADF patrol moved some {{convert|50|km|mi}} into southern Angola and occupied the [[Ruacana]]-[[Calueque]] [[hydro-electric]] complex and other installations on the [[Cunene River]].&lt;ref name=borderstrike/&gt;&lt;ref name=borderwar /&gt;{{rp|39}}
The scheme was an important strategic asset for [[Ovamboland]], which relied on it for its water supply.  The facility had been completed earlier in the year with South African funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Agreement between the government of the Republic of South Africa and the government of Portugal in regard to the first phase of development of the water resources of the Cunene river basin|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W7414B/w7414b11.htm|date=21 January 1969|publisher=''Département de l'administration et des finances'' (Portugal)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several hostile incidences with UNITA and SWAPO frightening foreign workers had provided a rationale for the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Days of the Generals|accessdate=2007-10-15|last=Hamann|first=Hilton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYgWcHq8lE8C|publisher=[[New Holland Publishers]]|year=2001|page=21| isbn=978-1-86872-340-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The defence of the facility in southern Angola also was South Africa's justification for the first permanent deployment of regular SADF units inside Angola.&lt;ref name="Relações Internacionais 1976"&gt;IPRI—Instituto Português de Relações Internacionais : The United States and the Portuguese Decolonization (1974–1976) Kenneth Maxwell, Council on Foreign Relations. Paper presented at the International Conference "Portugal, Europe and the United States", Lisbon, October, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Wayne: A Trap in Angola in: ''Foreign Policy'' No. 62, Spring 1986, p. 71, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&lt;/ref&gt;
On 22 August 1975 the SADF initiated operation "Sausage II", a major raid against SWAPO in southern Angola and on 4 September 1975, Vorster authorized the provision of limited military training, advice and logistical assistance. In turn FNLA and UNITA would help the South Africans fight SWAPO.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the MPLA had gained against UNITA in Southern Angola and by mid-October was in control of 12 of Angola's provinces and most cities. UNITA's territory had been shrinking to parts of central Angola,&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press) quoting: Bureau of Intelligence and Research, DOS, in: Angola: The MPLA Prepares for Independence, September 22, 1975, p 4-5, National Security Archive, Washington, quoting: ''Le Monde'', September 13, 1975, p. 3 and quoting: Diaz Arguelles to Colomé, October 1, 1975, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and it became apparent that UNITA did not have any chance of capturing Luanda by independence day, which neither the United States nor South Africa were willing to accept.&lt;ref name="Smith, Wayne 1986, p. 72"&gt;Smith, Wayne: A Trap in Angola in: ''Foreign Policy'' No. 62, Spring 1986, p. 72, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&lt;/ref&gt;

The SADF established a training camp near Silva Porto ([[Kuito]]) and prepared the defences of Nova Lisboa ([[Huambo]]). They assembled the mobile attack unit "Foxbat" to stop approaching FAPLA-units with which it clashed on 5 October, thus saving Nova Lisboa for UNITA.&lt;ref name=borderstrike/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Task Force Zulu===
On 14 October, the South Africans secretly initiated Operation Savannah when Task Force Zulu, the first of several South African columns, crossed from Namibia into [[Cuando Cubango]]. The operation provided for elimination of the MPLA from the southern border area, then from south western Angola, from the central region, and finally for the capture of Luanda (the political faction that held Luanda would be recognised by Portugal on independence day as the official government).&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press) quoting: Deon Geldenhuys in: The Diplomacy of Isolation: South African ''Foreign Policy'' Making, p. 80, quoting: du Preez, Sophia in: ''Avontuur in Angola. Die verhaal van Suid-Afrika se soldate in Angola 1975–1976'', Pretoria, pp. 32, 63, 86 and quoting: Spies, F. J. du Toit in: ''Operasie Savannah. Angola 1975–1976'', Pretoria, pp. 93–101&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[John Stockwell]], a former CIA officer, "there was close liaison between the CIA and the South Africans"&lt;ref name="Smith, Wayne 1986, p. 72"/&gt; and "'high officials' in Pretoria claimed that their intervention in Angola had been based on an 'understanding' with the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Marcum, John in: Lessons of Angola, Foreign Affairs 54, No. 3 (April 1976), quoted in: Smith, Wayne: A Trap in Angola in: ''Foreign Policy'' No. 62, Spring 1986, p. 62, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&lt;/ref&gt; The intervention was also backed by [[Zaire]] and [[Zambia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamman, H. (2008). Days of the Generals. Cape Town, South Africa: Zebra Press. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the liberation forces busy fighting each other, the SADF advanced very quickly. Task Force Foxbat joined the invasion in mid-October.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press) p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Wayne: A Trap in Angola in: ''Foreign Policy'' No. 62, Spring 1986, p. 62, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&lt;/ref&gt; The territory the MPLA had just gained in the south was quickly lost to the South African advances. After South African advisors and antitank weapons helped to stop an MPLA advance on Nova Lisboa ([[Huambo]]) in early October, Zulu captured Roçadas ([[Xangongo]]) by 20, Sá da Bandeira ([[Lubango]]) by 24 and [[Namibe (province)|Moçâmedes]] by 28 October.

With the South Africans moving quickly toward Luanda, the Cubans had to terminate the CIR at Salazar only 3 days after it started operating and deployed most of the instructors and Angolan recruits in Luanda.&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;
On 2–3 November, 51 Cubans from the CIR Benguela and South Africans had their first direct encounter near Catengue, where FAPLA unsuccessfully tried to stop the Zulu advance. This encounter led Zulu-Commander Breytenbach to conclude that his troops had faced the best organized FAPLA opposition to date.&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

For the duration of the campaign, Zulu had advanced 3,159&amp;nbsp;km in thirty-three days and had fought twenty-one battles / skirmishes in addition to sixteen hasty and fourteen deliberate attacks. the Task Force accounted for an estimated 210 MPLA dead, 96 wounded and 50 POWs while it had suffered 5 dead and 41 wounded.&lt;ref name=borderstrike/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eriksen|first=Garrett Ernst|title=Fighting Columns In Small Wars: An OMFTS Model|date=2000|page=16|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/41689820/SADF-OPs-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuban intervention===
After the MPLA debacle at Catengue, the Cubans became very aware of the South African intervention. On 4 November Castro decided to begin an intervention on an unprecedented scale: "[[Cuba in Angola|Operation Carlota]]". The same day, a first airplane with 100 heavy weapon specialists, which the MPLA had requested in September, left for Brazzaville, arriving in Luanda on 7 November. On November 9 the first 100 men of a contingent of a 652-strong battalion of elite Special Forces were flown in.&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; The 100 specialists and 88 men of the special forces were dispatched immediately to the nearby front at Kifangondo. They assisted 850 FAPLA, 200 [[Katanga Province|Katangans]] and one Soviet advisor.

With the help of the Cubans and the Soviet advisor, FAPLA decisively repelled an FNLA-Zairian assault in the [[Battle of Quifangondo|Battle of Kifangondo]] on 8 November.&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;  The South African contingent, 52 men commanded by General Ben de Wet Roos, that had provided for the artillery on the northern front, had to be evacuated by ship on 28 November.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press)  quoting: [[Willem Steenkamp|Steenkamp, Willem]] in: South Africa's Border War, 1966–1989, Gibraltar, 1989, p. 51-52; quoting:  Spies, F. J. du Toit in. ''Operasie Savannah. Angola 1975–1976'', Pretoria, 1989, p. 140 –143; quoting:  du Preez, Sophia in: ''Avontuur in Angola. Die verhaal van Suid-Afrika se soldate in Angola 1975–1976'', Pretoria, 1989, p. 121-122; quoting: de Villiers, PW, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; MPLA-leader [[Agostinho Neto]] proclaimed independence and the formation of the [[Angola|People's Republic of Angola]] on 11 November and became its first President.

===South African reinforcements===
[[File:Troop3 of DSquadron.PNG|thumb|South African soldiers in 1975]]
On 6 and 7 November 1975 Zulu captured the harbour cities of [[Benguela]] (terminal of the Benguela railroad) and [[Lobito]]. The towns and cities captured by the SADF were given to UNITA. In central Angola, at the same time, combat unit Foxbat had moved {{convert|800|km|mi}} north toward Luanda.&lt;ref name="Relações Internacionais 1976"/&gt; By then, the South Africans realised that Luanda could not be captured by independence day on 11 November and the South Africans considered ending the advance and retreating. But on 10 November 1975 Vorster relented to UNITA's urgent request to maintain the military pressure with the objective of capturing as much territory as possible before the impending meeting of the [[Organization of African Unity]].&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Zulu and Foxbat continued north with two new battle groups formed further inland (X-Ray and Orange) and "there was little reason to think the FAPLA would be able to stop this expanded force from capturing Luanda within a week."&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;
Through November and December 1975, the SADF presence in Angola numbered 2,900 to 3,000 personnel.&lt;ref name=borderstrike/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spies, F. J. du Toit in. ''Operasie Savannah. Angola 1975–1976'', Pretoria, 1989, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

After Luanda was secured against the north and with reinforcements from Cuba arriving, Zulu faced stronger resistance advancing on Novo Redondo ([[Sumbe]]). First Cuban reinforcements arrived in Porto Amboim, only a few km north of Novo Redondo, quickly destroying three bridges crossing the Queve river, effectively stopping the South African advance along the coast on 13 November 1975.&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), pp. 94–96&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite concerted efforts to advance north to Novo Redondo, the SADF was unable to break through FAPLA defences.&lt;ref&gt;Observer, December 7, 1975, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Times, December 11, 1975, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press)  quoting:  du Preez, Sophia in: Avontuur in Angola.

Angola 1975–1976'', Pretoria, 1989, p. 203–18&lt;/ref&gt; In a last successful advance a South African task force and UNITA troops captured Luso on the Benguela railway on 11 December which they held until 27 December.&lt;ref name=borderstrike/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press) quoting: du Preez, Sophia in: ''Avontuur in Angola. Die verhaal van Suid-Afrika se soldate in Angola 1975–1976'', Pretoria, 1989, p. 186-201&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of South African advance===
By mid-December South Africa extended military service and brought in reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), 8, December 28, 1975, E3 (quoting Botha)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press)  quoting: [[Willem Steenkamp|Steenkamp, Willem]] in: South Africa's Border War 1966–1989, Gibraltar,1989, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; "An indication of the seriousness of the situation ... is that one of the most extensive military call-ups in South African history is now taking place".&lt;ref&gt;''Rand Daily Mail'', January 16&lt;/ref&gt; By late December, the Cubans had deployed 3,500 to 4,000 troops in Angola, of which 1,000 were securing Cabinda,&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, (The University of North Carolina Press), p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually the struggle began to favour of the MPLA.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Wayne: A Trap in Angola in: Foreign Policy No. 62, Spring 1986, p. 72, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from being "bogged down" on the southern front,&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press) quoting: Secretary of State to all American Republic Diplomatic posts, December 20, 1975, NSA&lt;/ref&gt; the South African advance halted, "as all attempts by Battle-Groups Orange and X-Ray to extend the war into the interior had been forced to turn back by destroyed bridges".&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, South Africa had to deal with two other major setbacks: the international press criticism of the operation and the associated change of US policies. Following the discovery of SADF troops in Angola, most African and Western backers declined to continue to back the South Africans due to the negative publicity of links with the Apartheid government.&lt;ref&gt;Hallett, R.

==Major battles and incidents==

===Battle of Quifangondo===
{{Main|Battle of Quifangondo}}
On 10 November 1975, the day before Angolan independence, the FNLA attempted against advice to capture Luanda from the MPLA.  South African gunners and aircraft assisted the offensive which went horribly wrong for the attackers; they were routed by the FAPLA assisted by Cubans manning superior weaponry that had arrived recently in the country.  The South African artillery, antiquated due to the UN embargo, was not any match for the longer-ranged Cuban [[BM-21]] rocket launchers, and therefore could not influence the result of the battle.

===Battle of Ebo===
The Cuban military, anticipating a South African advance (under the direction of Lieutenant Christopher du Raan) towards the town of [[Ebo, Angola|Ebo]], established positions there at a river crossing to thwart any assault. The defending artillery force, equipped with a [[BM-21 Grad|BM-21]] battery, a 76mm field gun, and several anti-tank units, subsequently destroyed five to six armoured cars, whilst they were bogged down with RPG-7s, on November 25, killing 5 and wounding 11 South African soldiers.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Second in command (2IC) car manned by Lt Jaco "Bok" Kriel, Cpl Gerrie Hugo and Richard "Flappie" Ludwig scouted to the North to look for an alternative route across the river. They got bogged down but managed to dig themselves out of the mud. Unbeknown to them this happened right in front of the enemy positions. Apparently only the superb fire control of the enemy saved them from a certain demise.
Johann du Toit's troop moved forward towards the bridge after Hannes Swanepoel's troop deployed tactically and all, with the odd exception, got stuck in the mud.

The troop of Abrie Cloete also moved into the terrain and with the exception of the car of John Wahl suffered the same fate as the troop of Hannes Swanepoel. John Wahl then deployed in an excellent fire support position.
The first three vehicles got shot out. The fourth vehicle of Kees van der Linde returned fire with their co-axial Brownig machine gun and pinned the enemy down. At this stage Kees van der Linde's car broke down with a fuel line problem.
Kees managed to sort this out but got wounded in his legs in the process. This vehicle managed to withdraw back to the mortar position where it broke down again and Kees got seriously wounded for the second time. The 2IC car charged into the killing zone, after a call for help from Gert Botha and started the rescue attempt which saved the lives of at least eight more armoured members by drawing the fire away from them as the enemy would have shot the vehicles again and again. In the process they got shot out by various anti tank weapons. The first shot hit them on the muzzle-brake, the second took off the anti aircraft Browning and wounded Jaco Kriel over the top of his head and he sat down stunned for a minute or two. The car was thus useless as the co-axial Browning could not be reloaded by Kriel. John Wahl then knocked out the 76&amp;nbsp;mm and saved the crew of the 2IC car in the process. The 2IC car was now useless and withdrew but loaded the wounded Volgraaf on the front of their car and transported him back to the medical post. Bok Kriel however jumped out of the car, saw that Abrie Cloete abandonded his car and ran away. He took control of this car and together with John Wahl they continued with the rescue attempts.

Over the next few hours a fierce exchange of fire took place. In the process John Wahl moved in and rescued Gert Botha. Bok Kriel also moved in and rescues Jaco Kotze. Again John Wahl moved in and rescued Giel Visser. This he did without his gunner as to make space for Giel and for all intent and purposes were thus unarmed.
Taljaard was killed and Bok Kriel got wounded for the second time, in his neck.

All of these actions were launched on own initiative, without any orders been given and under death defying curcimstances because by then, the killing zone of the ambush was barraged by wave after wave of 122mm [[BM-21 Grad|BM-21]] multiple rocket launchers. This led to more than 80 (exact number unknown) casualties amongst the infantry which were surrogate forces in the form of [[FNLA]] and [[UNITA]] soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, Gerrie (2007). ''Africa Will Always Break Your Heart'', pp. 94-96. AuthorHouse UK, Central Milton Keynes. {{ISBN|9781425968175}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A SAAF [[Cessna 185]] spotter aircraft was shot down over Ebo the following day. This was the first tangible South African defeat of Operation Savannah.

==="Bridge 14"===
Following the ambush at Ebo, the South African ''Battle Group Foxbat'' began attempting to breach the Nhia River at "Bridge 14", a strategic crossing near the [[FAPLA]] headquarters north of [[Quibala]]. This ensuing Battle for Bridge 14 accounted for the many fierce actions fought by withdrawing Cuban and Angolan forces from the river inland to "Top Hat", a hill overlooking the southern approach to the bridge.&lt;ref name=borderstrike/&gt;&lt;ref name="borderwar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steenkamp|first1=Willem|authorlink1=Willem Steenkamp|title=South Africa's Border War 1966 – 1989|publisher=Ashanti Publishing|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}}&lt;ref name=diediesjourney&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diedericks|first1=André|authorlink1=André Diedericks|title=Journey Without Boundaries|year=2007|publisher=Just Done Productions Publishing|location=Durban, South Africa|isbn=978-1-920169-58-9|edition=2nd|url=http://www.justdone.co.za/shop/index.php?id_product=2&amp;controller=product|publication-date=23 June 2007|accessdate=29 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006150950/http://www.justdone.co.za/shop/index.php?id_product=2&amp;controller=product|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early December, ''Foxbat'' had infiltrated the hill with two artillery observers, who directed fire on FAPLA positions from a battery of [[BL 5.5-inch Medium Gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;George (2005), pp. 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; This development forced Cuban commander Raúl Arguelles to call off an intended counter-offensive and order a redeployment via Ebo, instructing his units to withdraw from the Nhia. His subsequent death in a landmine explosion caused much confusion in some sectors of the defence line, with several of the defending units overlooking Bridge 14 as a result of a series of miscommunications. Meanwhile, South African [[sapper]]s started repairing the bridge on December 11 despite heavy FAPLA opposition. By morning the Cuban situation had worsened with ''Foxbat'' advancing in full force.&lt;ref name="George"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_0yE0vcBQoC|pages=102–103|author=George George|year=2005|title=The Cuban Intervention in Angola, 1965–1991: From Che Guevara to Cuito Cuanavale|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-35015-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about 7 AM, the defending troops came under attack. Heavy artillery pounded the northern banks, wiping out several mortar positions and at least one ammunition truck. The Cubans, supported by [[ZPU-4]]s and [[BM-21 Grad]]s, covered the main road with [[9K11 Malyutka|Sagger]] [[wire-guided missile]]s to deter the South African advance. However, a column of twelve [[Eland Mk7|Eland-90 armoured car]]s supported by infantry broke through, skirting the road to confuse the missile teams, who had trained their weapons on the centre of the bridge.&lt;ref name="Rhodesia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhodesia.nl/bridge14.htm|title=The Battle of Bridge 14|website=www.rhodesia.nl|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elands swiftly engaged the remaining mortars with [[high-explosive]] shells, routing their crews. Twenty Cuban advisers were also dispatched when they attempted to overtake a Lieutenant van Vuuren's armoured car in the chaos, possibly mistaking it for an Angolan vehicle. Slowing to let the truck pass, van Vuuren promptly slammed a 90mm round into its rear – killing the occupants.&lt;ref name="Rhodesia"/&gt;

It was during this engagement that [[Danny Roxo]] single-handedly killed twelve FAPLA soldiers while conducting a reconnaissance of the bridge, an action for which he was awarded the [[Honoris Crux (1975)|Honoris Crux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sadf.sentinelprojects.com/sasfl/roxmed.html |title=Sentinel Projects: IN MEMORY OF THREE SPECIAL FORCES AND 32 BATTALION SOLDIERS |publisher=Sadf.sentinelprojects.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other South African military personnel were also decorated for bravery at Bridge 14, some posthumously. It is estimated that several hundred Cubans lost their lives during the attack; the SADF suffered 4 dead.&lt;ref name=borderstrike/&gt;&lt;ref name=diediesjourney/&gt;&lt;ref name="George"/&gt;

The events at Bridge 14 were subsequently dramatised by South Africa in the 1976 [[Afrikaans]] film '''''Brug 14'''''. The action was re-enacted using national servicemen. During the making of the film near Bethlehem in the OFS, Captain Douw Steyn was severely injured when a blank round from an Eland was accidentally fired and a piece of shrapnel removed his calf muscle. A useful rugby player, he went on to recover, and played one more match before hanging up the boots.

===Battle of Luso===

On December 10, the South African Task Force X-Ray followed the Benguela railway line from Silva Porto ([[Kuito]]) east to [[Luena, Moxico Province|Luso]], which they overran on the 10th December 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.wanadoo.nl/rhodesia/sadfhist.htm |title=Klantenservice &amp;#124; Online |publisher=Home.wanadoo.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South African contingent included an armoured squadron, supporting infantry units, some artillery, engineers, and UNITA irregulars. Their main objective was to seize the Luso airport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Luso_Airport_Angola_Dec_1975.jpg |title=File:Luso Airport Angola Dec 1975.jpg – Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which later went on to serve as a supply point until the South Africans finally departed Angola in early January 1976.

===Battles involving Battlegroup Zulu in the west===

There were numerous unrecorded clashes fought in the southwest between Colonel [[Jan Breytenbach]]'s SADF battlegroup and scattered MPLA positions during Operation Savannah. Eventually, Breytenbach's men were able to advance three thousand kilometers over Angolan soil in thirty-three days.

On a related note, Battlegroup Zulu later formed the basis of South Africa's famous [[South African 32 Battalion|32 Battalion]].

===Ambrizete incident===
[[File:HMS Rothesay (F107) MOD 45139938.jpg|thumb|right|President Class Frigate]]
The [[South African Navy]] was not planned to be involved in the hereunto land operation, but after a failed intervention by the South African Army in the [[Battle of Quifangondo]], nevertheless had to hastily extract a number of army personnel by sea from far behind enemy lines in Angola, as well as abandoned guns. Ambrizete north of [[Luanda]] at {{Coord|7|13|25|S|12|51|24|E|display=inline|name=Ambizete}} was chosen as the pick-up point for the gunners involved in the defeat at Quifangondo. The [[frigate]]s {{SAS|President Kruger}} and {{SAS|President Steyn|F147|6}} went to the area, where the latter used inflatable boats and its [[Westland Wasp]] helicopter to extract 26 personnel successfully from the beach on 28 November 1975.&lt;ref name=borderstrike/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://jgower.co.za/commandpost/anecdotes/24504600_1144505641.pdf|title=Operation Savannah November 1975: Ambrizette|accessdate=2007-09-26|first1=Chris|last1=Bennett|authorlink1=Chris Bennett (SA Navy)|publisher=Just Done Productions Publishing|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=threefrigates&gt;{{Cite book|title = Three Frigates – The South African Navy Comes of Age|last1 = Bennett|first1 = Chris|authorlink1=Chris Bennett (SA Navy)|publisher = Just Done Productions Publishing|year = 2006|isbn = 978-1-920169-02-2|location = Durban, South Africa|url = http://www.justdone.co.za/shop/index.php?id_product=4&amp;controller=product|edition = 2nd|publication-date = 1 June 2006|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[replenishment oiler]] {{SAS|Tafelberg}} provided logistical support to the frigates, and picked up the guns in Ambriz after they were towed to [[Zaire]], and took them to [[Walvis Bay]].

General [[Constand Viljoen]], who had grave concerns at the time about the safety of both his soldiers and abandoned field guns, called it "the most difficult night ever in my operational career".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Days of the Generals|accessdate=2007-10-15|last=Hamann|first=Hilton|publisher=[[New Holland Publishers]]|year=2001|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of this operation was exceptionally fortuitous, given that the South African Navy had been penetrated by the spy [[Dieter Gerhardt]].

==Aftermath==

==South African order of battle==
{{Main|South African order of battle during Operation Savannah}}
The South Africans deployed a number of Combat Groups during Operation Savannah – initially, only Combat Groups A and B were deployed, with the remaining groups being mobilised and deployed into Angola later in the campaign.  There has been much dispute the overall size of Task Force Zulu.  Current evidence indicates that the Task Force started with approximately 500 men and grew to a total of 2,900 with the formation of Battle Groups Foxbat, Orange and X-Ray.&lt;ref&gt;Edward (2005) p.315&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association==
The Savannah Association is an association of ex-servicemen of all units who were involved in the operation. They meet annually to commemorate the operation. The insignia of the association is a [[Caltrop]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2212">The '''Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society''' ('''OAHS''') has existed in one form or another since at least 1839, although with its current name only since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/modern/oahs/oahs.html Papers deposited by the Oxford Architectural and Historical Society], [[Bodleian Library]], [[University of Oxford]], United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; Its annual publication ''Oxoniensia'' has been produced since 1936.

==Overview==
The Society was founded in 1839 as the '''Society for Promoting the Study of Gothic Architecture'''. In 1848, it was renamed to become the '''Oxford Architectural Society''' and in 1860 it was re-founded as the '''Oxford Architectural and Historical Society'''. In 1972, the society was renamed to its current name when it merged with the Oxfordshire Archaeological Society.

The Society attracts members who are interested in the [[archaeology]], [[architecture]] and [[history]] of [[Oxford]] and [[Oxfordshire]] in [[England]]. As well as the annual publication of ''Oxoniensia'', OAHS organises lectures and excursions, which are open to all members.

The OAHS has a reciprocal arrangement with the [[Oxford University Archaeological Society]], which allows the members of one body to attend meetings and excursions organised by the other. 

The OAHS is affiliated to the [[Council for British Archaeology]].

== Oxoniensia ==
'''''Oxoniensia''''', started in 1936, is the annual [[Academic journal|journal]] of OAHS, which is sent to all members.

[[File:Pano of Gunbarrel grasslands and dune in the Gibson Desert Nature Reserve. (6937186643).jpg|thumb|Gibson Desert]]
The '''Pintupi Nine''' were a group of nine [[Pintupi]] people who lived a traditional [[hunter-gatherer]] desert-dwelling life in Australia's [[Gibson Desert]] until 1984, when they made contact with their relatives near [[Kiwirrkurra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30500591|title=The day the Pintupi Nine entered the modern world|first=Alana|last=Mahony|date=23 December 2014|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are sometimes also referred to as "the lost tribe". The group were hailed as "the last nomads" in the international press when they left their nomadic life in October 1984.&lt;ref name="The Last Nomads"&gt;[http://www.aboriginalartstore.com.au/aboriginal-art-culture/the-last-nomads.php The Last Nomads] at Aboriginal Art Store&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The group roamed between [[soakage|waterholes]] near [[Lake Mackay]], near the [[Western Australia]]-[[Northern Territory]] border, wearing [[Australian Aboriginal hairstring|hairstring belt]]s and armed with {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|spell=in|frac=2}} wooden [[spear]]s and [[Woomera (spear-thrower)|spear throwers]], and intricately carved [[boomerang]]s. Their diet was dominated by [[goanna]] and [[rabbit]] as well as [[bush food]] native plants. The group was a family, consisting of two co-wives (Nanyanu and Papalanyanu) and seven children. There were four brothers ([[Warlimpirrnga Tjapaltjarri|Warlimpirrnga]], [[Walala Tjapaltjarri|Walala]], [[Thomas Tjapaltjarri|Tamlik]], and Piyiti) and three sisters ([[Yalti Napangati|Yalti]], [[Yukultji_Napangati|Yikultji]] and [[Takariya Napaltjarri|Takariya]]). The boys and girls were all in their early-to-late teens, although their exact ages were not known; the mothers were in their late 30s.

The father&amp;nbsp;– the husband of the two wives&amp;nbsp;– died, possibly from eating spoiled canned foods found at an old mining exploration camp. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} After this, the group travelled south to where they thought their relatives might be, as they had seen 'smokes' in that direction. They encountered a man from Kiwirrkura but due to misunderstanding they fled back north while he returned to the community and alerted others who then travelled back with him to find the group. The community members quickly realised that the group were relatives who had been left behind in the desert twenty years earlier, when many had travelled into the missions nearer [[Alice Springs]]. The community members travelled by vehicle to where the group were last seen and then tracked them for some time before finding them. After making contact and establishing their relationships, the Pintupi nine were invited to come and live at Kiwirrkura, where most of them still reside.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite journal| journal=American Ethnologist|title=Locating ethnographic practice: Romance, reality and politics in the outback.|first=Fred |last=Myers|volume= 15 |issue= 4 |date= November 1988|doi=10.1525/ae.1988.15.4.02a00010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pintupi language|Pintupi]]-speaking trackers told them there was plenty of food, and water that came out of pipes; Yalti has said that this concept astounded them.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Medical examination revealed that the Tjapaltjarri clan (as they are also known) were "in beautiful condition. Not an ounce of fat, well proportioned, strong, fit, healthy".&lt;ref&gt;Charlie McMahon: Sunday Times&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Kiwirrkura]], near [[Kintore, Northern Territory|Kintore]], they met with other members of their extended family.

In 1986, Piyiti went back to the desert.&lt;ref name="heraldsun"&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/lost-tribe-happy-in-modern-world/story-e6frf7l6-1111112932308 Lost tribe happy in modern world]; the [[Herald Sun]], Nigel Adam, February 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Warlimpirrnga, Walala, and Tamlik (now known as "Thomas") have gained international recognition in the art world as the Tjapaltjarri Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboriginalartstore.com.au/exhibitions/tjapaltjarri-brothers-the-last-nomads/tjapaltjarri-brothers-the-last.php Tjapaltjarri Brothers] at the Aboriginal Art Store&lt;/ref&gt; The three sisters, [[Yalti Napangati|Yalti]], [[Yukultji_Napangati|Yikultji]] and [[Takariya Napaltjarri|Takariya]], are also well-known Aboriginal artists whose works can be seen on exhibition and purchased from a number of art dealers.  One of the mothers has died; the other has settled with the three sisters in Kiwirrkurra.&lt;ref name="heraldsun" /&gt;

Raico was from New York City,&lt;ref name=FFF-Bio&gt;[http://fff.org/author/ralph-raico/ Ralph Raico biography] at Future of Freedom Foundation website, ''accessed'' November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended [[The Bronx High School of Science]]. Through the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], Raico and his classmate [[George Reisman]] arranged to meet with economist [[Ludwig von Mises]], who subsequently invited them to attend his graduate seminar on [[Austrian economics]] at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reisman|1996|p=xliii}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he met fellow seminar attendee [[Murray Rothbard]], who befriended him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BOrT8tMMS5AC&amp;pg=PA249 249–50]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casey|2010|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard and his friends Raico, Reisman, [[Ronald Hamowy]], and [[Robert Hessen]] formed a "self-conscious intellectual and activist salon" they named the "Circle [[Frédéric Bastiat|Bastiat]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BOrT8tMMS5AC&amp;pg=PA251 251]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reismanxliv"&gt;{{harvnb|Reisman|1996|p=xliv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1950s, the Circle Bastiat also brought Raico into contact with novelist [[Ayn Rand]] and her followers, informally known at the time as "[[The Collective (Ayn Rand)|The Collective]]".&lt;ref name="Reismanxliv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raico attended the first lectures about Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].&lt;ref name="Reismanxlvi"&gt;{{harvnb|Reisman|1996|p=xlvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually relations between the two groups soured, leading to an incident in which the Circle parodied the Collective, performing a skit in which Raico played the part of Rand's protege [[Nathaniel Branden]].&lt;ref name="Heller299"&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 1958 Rand and Rothbard had broken off all ties, and the groups stopped associating.&lt;ref name="Reismanxlvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heller299"/&gt;

Raico received his B.A. from the [[City College of New York]]&lt;ref name=FFF-Bio/&gt; and his Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]], where his adviser was [[Friedrich Hayek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamowy|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ioakmq8yxA4C&amp;pg=PA339 339]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
While at the University of Chicago, Raico founded ''The New Individualist Review'', a libertarian publication which first published in April 1961 and produced 17 issues until it ceased publication in 1968.&lt;ref name="Hamowy339-346"&gt;{{harvnb|Hamowy|1999|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ioakmq8yxA4C&amp;pg=PA339 339–46]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raico and other graduate students comprised the editorial board. Hayek and [[Milton Friedman]] and later, economist [[George Stigler]], were on the advisory board. In 1981, Friedman wrote that he believed the publication had "set an intellectual standard which has not yet, I believe, been matched by any of the more recent publications in the same philosophical tradition."&lt;ref name="Hamowy339-346"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Jeff Riggenbach, [https://mises.org/daily/5452/The-Journalism-of-Hamowy-and-Raico The Journalism of Hamowy and Raico], "Mises Daily", [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], July 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raico later became senior editor of ''[[Inquiry (magazine)|Inquiry]]'' magazine. He was an associate editor of ''[[The Independent Review]]'', a journal published by [[The Independent Institute]],&lt;ref name="IndependentProfile"/&gt; and a senior fellow of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], which published his work on the history of liberty and the connection between war and the state.&lt;ref name=LVMI-Bio&gt;[https://mises.org/daily/author/344 Ralph Raico biography] at [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] website, ''accessed'' November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Raico translated Mises' book, ''[[Liberalismus]]'' and various essays by [[Friedrich Hayek]] into English.&lt;ref name=IndependentProfile/&gt;

==Views==
Raico has spoken favorably of [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://fee.org/articles/when-liberalism-went-into-retreat/&lt;/ref&gt;

On foreign policy, Raico was in favor of [[non-interventionism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lewrockwell.com/2011/04/ralph-raico/americas-will-to-kill/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.org/pdf/book_excerpts/Foreword_CivMilitary_Raico.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Raico died on December 13, 2016 at the age of 80.

'''Randall Keith Acord''' (February 27, 1919{{spaced ndash}}May 19, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Death Index:http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[historian]] of [[United States|American]] [[aviation]] who in 1992 founded the [[Alaska]] Air Pioneer [[Museum]] at [[Pioneer Park, Fairbanks|Pioneer Park]] in [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=chron&gt;http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/5795244.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Acord was a native of [[Clarendon, Texas|Clarendon]], the seat of [[Donley County, Texas|Donley County]] in the [[Texas Panhandle]] some sixty miles east of [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]]. He attended college for two years and worked as an [[electrician]], when on August 18, 1941, he enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aad.archives.gov/aad/record-detail.jsp?dt=893&amp;rid=1521979|title=NARA - AAD - Display Full Records - Electronic Army Serial Number Merged File, ca. 1938 - 1946 (Enlistment Records)|website=aad.archives.gov|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Acord was a young test [[aircraft pilot|pilot]] stationed at Ladd Field, now [[Fort Wainwright]], an Army post in Fairbanks. He flew planes with the Cold Weather Testing Station and experimented with heating systems and landing planes with [[ski]]s. He left the then [[United States Air Force]] with the rank of [[major (rank)|major]]. Subsequently, he was awarded the Alaska-[[Siberia]] [[Lend Lease]] Award for his contributions to [[Russia]]n-[[North America]]n relations during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

Acord had a vast knowledge of [[aeronautics]]. He recorded an [[oral history]] of the technical details of his flights. His wife of fifty years, Marion Acord, who survived him, took detailed notes for the benefit of future researchers. Mike Cox, a former manager at Pioneer Park, which houses the aviation museum, said that Acord possessed a "depth of knowledge about anything related to aviation . . . a treasure trove of information."&lt;ref name=fairb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsminer.com|title=newsminer.com - The voice of Interior Alaska|first=Fairbanks Daily|last=News-Miner|website=Fairbanks Daily News-Miner|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acord conceived the idea for the museum in the late 1970s when the military was considering closing Fort Wainwright. However, the post remains open. The museum opened to the public in 1992 after Acord spent thousands of dollars of his own money to overcome construction setbacks.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;{{Clarify|date=October 2011|reason=It would help to understand what "construction setbacks" means, as I'm pretty sure the building which houses the museum was built decades before 1992.}}

Acord told the ''[[Fairbanks Daily News-Miner]]'' that "There is so much [[history]] going away nowadays. People don't record events, and then they pass on, and it's gone. I would like to see this history passed on to the younger people of this country."&lt;ref name=fairb/&gt;

Acord flew a small carrier for several years and went into business as a food distributor to outlying [[village]]s. He continued to fly until he was in his early eighties. He died in Fairbanks from complications of [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=fairb/&gt;

He was a member of the Air Force Memorial Foundation, chaired by [[H. Ross Perot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforcememorial.org/registry/index_results.asp?last_name=a|title=Air Force Memorial Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102134748/http://www.airforcememorial.org/registry/index_results.asp?last_name=a|archivedate=2 January 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] "Master Pilot Award List".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/safety/awards/wright_bros/list/|title=FAA - Master Pilot Award List&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216225929/http://www.faa.gov/safety/awards/wright_bros/list/|archivedate=16 February 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saeculum''' (latin time, century) is a German [[scholarly journal]]. It was launched in 1950 by the historian [[Georg Stadtmüller]] and was originally published by Verlag Karl Alber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Title Page|journal=SAECULUM: Jahrbuch für Universalgeschichte|date=1950|volume=1|issue=1|pages=I-II}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003 it has been published by Böhlau Verlag.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boehlau-verlag.com/0080-5319.html|title=Böhlau Verlag|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtitled "Jahrbuch für Universalgeschichte", the journal is devoted to [[world history]] and mainly focuses on [[Social history|social]], [[Economic history|economic]], and [[cultural history|cultural]] aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Website of the editorial office at [https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/saeculum/558929.html Georg-August-Universität Göttingen] - Saeculum, 2017-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; It features a wide variety of topics by scholars from various disciplines. An editorial published in 2013 states that it is "open to ... contributions ranging from pre- and protohistory to the present" and "to all historical topics including natural environments" and that it seeks to overcome a eurocentric perspective by publishing articles on all world regions and by encouraging comparison and the observation of transcultural entanglements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paul|first=Axel T.|date=2013|title=Universalgeschichte - ein Editoral|url=|journal=Saeculum|volume=63|pages=1, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a mission statement included in the journal's blurb, it also offers a "forum for fundamental debates" in history and [[cultural studies]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Saeculum is a [[peer-review]]ed journal and is published biannually. Its general editors are the German historians Peter Burschel and Christoph Marx. It publishes articles in German, English, and French.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4656">'''''Saving Our Vanishing Heritage: Safeguarding Endangered Cultural Heritage Sites in the Developing World''''' was a report released by [[Global Heritage Fund]] on October 17, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalheritagefund.org/what_we_do/introduction |title=GHF |publisher=Global Heritage Fund |date= |accessdate=2012-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705231526/http://globalheritagefund.org/what_we_do/introduction |archivedate=2012-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It illuminated five accelerating man-made threats facing global heritage sites in developing countries: development pressures, unsustainable tourism, insufficient management, looting, and war and conflict.

Based on these threats, the report surveyed 500 major archaeological and heritage sites in developing countries to evaluate current loss and destruction, conservation and development. It identified nearly 200 of these sites as "At Risk” or “Under Threat,” and the following 12 as “On the Verge” of irreparable loss and destruction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalheritagefund.org/index.php/what_we_do/sites_on_the_verge/ |title=GHF |publisher=Global Heritage Fund |date= |accessdate=2012-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820022935/http://globalheritagefund.org/index.php/what_we_do/sites_on_the_verge/ |archivedate=2012-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''timeline of meteorology''' contains events of scientific and technological advancements in the area of [[atmospheric sciences]].  The most notable advancements in observational [[meteorology]], [[weather forecasting]], [[climatology]], [[atmospheric chemistry]], and [[atmospheric physics|atmospheric]] [[physics]] are listed chronologically.  Some historical weather events are included that mark time periods where advancements were made, or even that sparked policy change

==Antiquity==
* 3000 BC – Meteorology in India can be traced back to around 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, with writings such as the [[Upanishads]], containing discussions about the processes of cloud formation and rain and the seasonal cycles caused by the movement of earth round the sun.&lt;ref name="IMD History"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=India Meteorological Department |url=http://www.imd.gov.in/pages/about_history.php |title=History of Meteorological Services in India |date=March 19, 2016 |accessdate=March 19, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6g7x5NVMA?url=http://www.imd.gov.in/pages/about_history.php |archivedate=March 19, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 600 BC – [[Thales]] may qualify as the first Greek meteorologist. He reputedly issues the first seasonal crop forecast.
* 400 BC – There is some evidence that [[Democritus]] predicted changes in the weather, and that he used this ability to convince people that he could predict other future events.&lt;ref name="NOAA" /&gt;
* 400 BC – [[Hippocrates]] writes a treatise called ''Airs, Waters and Places'', the earliest known work to include a discussion of weather. More generally, he wrote about common diseases that occur in particular locations, seasons, winds and air.&lt;ref name="NOAA" /&gt;
* 350 BC – The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] writes ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', a work which represents the sum of knowledge of the time about [[earth science]]s, including weather and climate. It is the first known work that attempts to treat a broad range of meteorological topics.&lt;ref name="Ancient"&gt;{{cite web |editor1=Toth, Garry |editor2=Hillger, Don | title=Ancient and pre-Renaissance Contributors to Meteorology| year=2007 | url=http://rammb.cira.colostate.edu/dev/hillger/ancient.htm#biruni |publisher=Colorado State University| accessdate=2014-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, precipitation and the clouds from which precipitation falls are called meteors, which originate from the Greek word ''meteoros'', meaning 'high in the sky'. From that word comes the modern term [[meteorology]], the study of clouds and weather. 
:Although the term ''meteorology'' is used today to describe a subdiscipline of the atmospheric sciences, Aristotle's work is more general.  Meteorologica is based on intuition and simple observation, but not on what is now considered the scientific method. In his own words:
::''...all the affections we may call common to air and water, and the kinds and parts of the earth and the affections of its parts.''&lt;ref name="Aristotle"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle |title=Meteorology |url=http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/meteorology/ |year=2004 |publisher=eBooks@Adelaide |location=The University of Adelaide Library, University of Adelaide, South Australia 5005 |quote=Translated by E.

::The magazine ''[[De Mundo]]'' (attributed to [[Pseudo-Aristotle]]) notes:&lt;ref name=1908DeMundo&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/demundoarisrich|title=De Mundo|year=1914|author=Aristotle; Forster, E. S. (Edward Seymour), 1879–1950; Dobson, J. F. (John Frederic), 1875–1947|page=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
::''Cloud is a vaporous mass, concentrated and producing water. Rain is produced from the compression of a closely condensed cloud, varying according to the pressure exerted on the cloud; when the pressure is slight it scatters gentle drops; when it is great it produces a more violent fall, and we call this a shower, being heavier than ordinary rain, and forming continuous masses of water falling over earth. Snow is produced by the breaking up of condensed clouds, the cleavage taking place before the change into water; it is the process of cleavage which causes its resemblance to foam and its intense whiteness, while the cause of its coldness is the congelation of the moisture in it before it is dispersed or rarefied. When snow is violent and falls heavily we call it a blizzard. Hail is produced when snow becomes densified and acquires impetus for a swifter fall from its close mass; the weight becomes greater and the fall more violent in proportion to the size of the broken fragments of cloud. Such then are the phenomena which occur as the result of moist exhalation.''
:One of the most impressive achievements in ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'' is his description of what is now known as the [[hydrologic cycle]]:
::''Now the sun, moving as it does, sets up processes of change and becoming and decay, and by its agency the finest and sweetest water is every day carried up and is dissolved into vapour and rises to the upper region, where it is condensed again by the cold and so returns to the earth.''&lt;ref name="Aristotle" /&gt;

[[Image:Bust of Aristotle.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Aristotle]]

*Several years after Aristotle's book, his pupil [[Theophrastus]] puts together a book on [[weather forecasting]] called ''The Book of Signs''. Various indicators such as solar and lunar halos formed by high clouds are presented as ways to forecast the weather. The combined works of Aristotle and Theophrastus have such authority they become the main influence in the study of clouds, weather and weather forecasting for nearly 2000 years.&lt;ref name="Ancient"/&gt;
* 250 BC – [[Archimedes]] studies the concepts of [[buoyancy]] and the hydrostatic principle. Positive buoyancy is necessary for the formation of convective clouds ([[cumulus cloud|cumulus]], [[cumulus congestus]] and [[cumulonimbus]]).&lt;ref name="NOAA" /&gt;
* 25 AD – [[Pomponius Mela]], a geographer for the [[Roman empire]], formalizes the climatic zone system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.paleorama.com/timelines/geography.html| title = Timeline of geography, paleontology| publisher = Paleorama.com| quote = Following the path of Discovery}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* c. 80 AD – In his ''[[Lunheng]]'' (論衡; Critical Essays), the [[Han Dynasty]] [[Chinese philosopher]] [[Wang Chong]] (27–97 AD) dispels the [[China|Chinese]] myth of rain coming from the heavens, and states that rain is evaporated from water on the earth into the air and forms clouds, stating that clouds condense into rain and also form dew, and says when the clothes of people in high mountains are moistened, this is because of the air-suspended rain water.&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). ''[[Science and Civilization in China]]: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wang Chong supports his theory by quoting a similar one of Gongyang Gao's,&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt; the latter's commentary on the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the [[Gongyang Zhuan]], compiled in the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt; showing that the Chinese conception of rain evaporating and rising to form clouds goes back much farther than Wang Chong. Wang Chong wrote:
::''As to this coming of rain from the mountains, some hold that the clouds carry the rain with them, dispersing as it is precipitated (and they are right). Clouds and rain are really the same thing. Water evaporating upwards becomes clouds, which condense into rain, or still further into dew.''&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

==Middle Ages==
* 500 AD – In around 500&amp;nbsp;AD, the Indian astronomer, mathematician, and astrologer: [[Varāhamihira]] published his work Brihat-Samhita's, which provides clear evidence that a deep knowledge of atmospheric processes existed in the Indian region.&lt;ref name="IMD History"/&gt;
* 7th century – The poet [[Kalidasa]] in his epic [[Meghaduta]], mentions the date of onset of the south-west [[Monsoon]] over central India and traces the path of the monsoon clouds.&lt;ref name="IMD History"/&gt;
* 7th century – [[St. Isidore of Seville]],in his work ''De Rerum Natura'', writes about astronomy, cosmology and meteorology. In the chapter dedicated to Meteorology, he discusses the [[thunder]], clouds, [[rainbows]] and wind.&lt;ref name="NOAA" /&gt;
* 9th century – [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), an [[Islamic geography|Arab naturalist]], writes a treatise on meteorology entitled ''Risala fi l-Illa al-Failali l-Madd wa l-Fazr'' (''Treatise on the Efficient Cause of the Flow and Ebb''), in which he presents an argument on [[tide]]s which "depends on the changes which take place in bodies owing to the rise and fall of temperature."&lt;ref&gt;Plinio Prioreschi, [http://www.ishim.net/ishimj/2/03.pdf "Al-Kindi, A Precursor Of The Scientific Revolution"], Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine, 2002 (2): 17–19 [17].&lt;/ref&gt;
* 9th century – [[Al-Dinawari]], a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] naturalist, writes the ''Kitab al-Nabat'' (''Book of Plants''), in which he deals with the application of meteorology to agriculture during the [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution]]. He describes the meteorological character of the sky, the planets and [[constellation]]s, the Sun and Moon, the [[lunar phase]]s indicating seasons and rain, the ''anwa'' ([[Astronomical object|heavenly bodies]] of rain), and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, floods, valleys, rivers, lakes, wells and other sources of water.&lt;ref name=Fahd-815&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahd|first=Toufic|contribution=Botany and agriculture|page=815}}, in {{Cite book |last1=Morelon |first1=Régis |last2=Rashed |first2=Roshdi |year=1996 |title=[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]] |volume=3 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-12410-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10th century – [[Ibn Wahshiyya]]'s ''Nabatean Agriculture'' discusses the [[weather forecasting]] of atmospheric changes and signs from the planetary astral alterations; signs of rain based on observation of the [[lunar phase]]s, nature of thunder and lightning, direction of sunrise, behaviour of certain plants and animals, and weather forecasts based on the movement of winds; [[pollen]]ized air and winds; and formation of winds and [[vapour]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahd|first=Toufic|contribution=Botany and agriculture|page=842}}, in {{Harv|Morelon|Rashed|1996|pp=813–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;
