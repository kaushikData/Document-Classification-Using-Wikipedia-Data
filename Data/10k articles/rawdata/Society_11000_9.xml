==History==
===Establishment and start of the club (1907–1916)===
[[File:ModernEgypt, Saad Zaghloul, BAP 14785.jpg|170px|thumb|left|[[nationalists|Egyptian Nationalist]] [[Saad Zaghloul]], the first honorary president of Al Ahly]]
The idea of establishing Al Ahly in the first decade of the century was raised by Omar Lotfy during his presidency of the High School Students Club which was established in 1905 The establishment of the club of high school students was for political reasons, and found that these students needed a sport club that combined them for leisure and exercise. He introduced the idea of establishing the club to a group of friends who were enthusiastic about the idea. In 1907, Al Ahly was established.

[[File:Talaat Harb.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Talaat Harb]], president of the [[Banque Misr|Bank of Egypt]], contributed 100 pounds to the establishment of the club]]
Omar Lotfy abdicated the honor of the position of the president of the club in favor of Michel Anse, who was an advisor to the Ministry of Finance at the time to facilitate financial support for the club. An official meeting of the club's board was held on April 24, 1907. The committee met at 5:30 pm in the house of Michel Anas [[Giza]] in his chairmanship and the membership of Idris Ragheb Bey, Ismael Sari Pasha and Sami Basha and Omar Lotfi Bek and Mohamed Effendi Sherif as secretary The establishment of the club was approved and Ismail Seri designed the main building of the club as an architect. A civil company on behalf of Al Ahly Sports Club was established and shares of the company worth 5EGP Pounds per share, and was the goal of the club when it was established to raise the amount of 5000 pounds, but it was Collected 3165 pounds over a year and that was not enough, which forced the club to borrow 1,000 pounds from the [[National Bank of Egypt]] in March 1908 by Omar Sultan and Idris Ragheb and [[Talaat Harb]] which contributed 100 pounds to the establishment of the club. First honorary president of the club was the leader [[Saad Zaghloul]] in his position as Ministry of Education that time. The name of the Al Ahly Sporting Club was suggested by Amine Samy Amin, to serve the students and graduates of high schools who were the mainstay of the revolution against the English occupation.

On April 2, 1908, Michel Inse stepped down as president of the club. Aziz Azzat was appointed as new president  and became the first Egyptian president of Al Ahly. The official opening ceremony of the club was held in the club's main building on 26 February 1909.

Although the game of football was not one of the goals of the founders of Al Ahly club the goal of the club was openining its doors to students of higher schools to meet and practice political dialogues, but the graduates of high schools members of the club have fallen in love with [[association football|football]], which prompted Ahly to build the first stadium In 1909 and they used to call it the time (Al-Hawsh), which is a colloquial word from Egyptian dialect means the courtyard in Arabic. The stadium was developed over the years to be [[Mokhtar El-Tetsh Stadium]].

The first official football team was established in 1911. The team is one of the primary and secondary school players who played the ball in Al-Hawash, which was established in 1909 in the club's land. The names of the first players of Al Ahli club were as follows: Hussain Higazi, Abdel Fattah Taher, Fouad Darwish, Hussein Mansour and Ibrahim Fahmy. The star of this team was the striker [[Hussein Hegazi]].

=== Beginning of participating in local competitions (1917) ===
In 1917, Al ahly wanted to demonstrate the strength of the Egyptian clubs against the Allied military teams founded by Britain in Egypt. Al Ahly agreed to play against [[Zamalek SC]], which was under the control of foreigners at this time. The match was held on February 9, 1917 at Zamalek Stadium. Al-Ahly won 1-0 with a goal scored by Abdulhamid Muharram.
In 1918 the club first official participation was held. After Al Ahly refused to compete with the foreign allies for the first edition of the Sultan Husain Cup in 1917, the club decided to participate in the 1918 tournament.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Club contributions for the Egyptian football===

The Egyptian League championship began in 1948–49. Al Ahly won the inaugural competition, the first of nine successive national championship titles.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Al-Ahly |title=Al-Ahly |last=Gifford |first=Clive |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |archive-date=21 June 2017 |access-date=5 September 2017 |ref=EncyclopædiaBritannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the deposing of [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]] in the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|revolution of 1952]], Ahly appointed [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] as club president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parkinson|first1=Gary|title=Into the top 10 and the cauldron of fervour that is the biggest derby in Egypt...|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/fourfourtwos-50-biggest-derbies-world-no10-al-ahly-vs-zamalek|website=Four Four Two|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Ahly did not win the league for 13 years. After years of deterioration, Ahly took the first steps to recovery when the management decided to sign the golden player of Hungary in the fifties, [[Nándor Hidegkuti]], in September 1973 at a salary of fewer than 600 dollars.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The title returned to Al Ahly in 1974–1975, with the team scoring 70 goals in 34 games.

In the return match in [[Kumasi]], Mahmoud Khatib returned to score again and the game ended 1–1, with Al-Ahly winning their first continental championship. Al-Ahly reached the final of the [[CAF Champions League|African Champions League]] for the second time in a row in 1983, but rival Kotoko managed to avenge their defeat by scoring the only goal in both matches.

In the same season, Al Ahly won the Egyptian Cup by beating [[Ghazl El Mahalla SC]] 3–2 in the final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/egycuphist.html “Egyptian Cup winners”]. Rsssf. Retrieved 22 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Ahly participated in the Arab Championships for the first time in 1994 after a decision to boycott the African tournaments due to weak financial returns. They won the cup by defeating [[Al-Shabab FC (Riyadh)]] with a goal by [[Felix Aboagye]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alahlyegypt.com/announcement/%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A/|title=تفوق عربي – الموقع الرسمى للنادى الأهلى|first=|last=alahlyegypt|website=alahlyegypt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leading Al Ahly to its second consecutive league title and the Arab Super Cup in Morocco, Rainer Holman left Al Ahly at the end of 1997, after finishing second in the Arab League Champions League in Tunisia. He was replaced by his countryman Rainer Tsubil, who succeeded in winning the league championship for the fifth consecutive season in 1997–1998. Al Ahly won the 1998 Arab Super Cup title with Tsubil for the second successive season after beating MC Oran, Algerian, Saudi Arabia, and African-Tunisian. Al-Ahly returned to the African partnership for the first time in six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alahlyegypt.com/announcement/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9/|title=استمرار المدرسة الألمانية – الموقع الرسمى للنادى الأهلى|first=|last=alahlyegypt|website=alahlyegypt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2001, Ahly signed [[Manuel Jose]] to take on the technical leadership of the team and this was the first time in the history of the club, which is used by a coach from the Portuguese school.
Jose's first acquaintance with Al Ahly was the friendly match against [[Real Madrid]] in August 2001, when the Reds shocked Europe's oldest club with the goal of Nigerian Sunday Ebege. It was the fourth time in history that Al-Ahli had defeated a European team with a newly crowned Champions League title. Al-Ahly won the African Champions League title 4–1 victory over South Africa's [[Mamelodi Sundowns F.C.]]. Al Ahli also confirmed his continental supremacy by grabbing the Super Cup with another landslide victory over South African team. This time the victim was [[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.]], who lost 4–1 in Cairo in a match in which Ahly goalkeeper [[Essam El-Hadary]] scored his historic goal. Jose was unable to collect any local championship in his first term.

Al-Ahly also won the first Egyptian Super Cup with an exciting win over [[ENPPI Club]] 1–0, with a goal in extra time by [[Wael Gomaa]]. At the end of 2005, Ahly won the African Champions League for the fourth time in their history after Tunisia's 3–0 defeat of [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] in Cairo before winning the Super Cup by beating Association Sportive des FAR with penalties. Al Ahly then appeared at the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan for the first time, but the start was not successful as the team lost to [[Sydney FC]] and then Saudi Arabia's [[Al-Ittihad Club (Jeddah)]].

Many believe that 2006 is the best in the history of Al Ahly in terms of various achievements, starting with the Super League for the second time with another exciting win over Enppi with the goal of in stoppage time. Al-Ahly is also re-winning the league title for the second time in a row. Al Ahly then returned to the Egyptian Cup with a big 3–0 win over [[Zamalek SC]], scoring the full mark in local championships.

Pachuca]] and [[Adelaide Football Club]] . Al-Ahly started 2009 with the title of the Super African Cup after defeating CS Sfaxien 2–1 with [[Flávio Amado]]'s goals, before the start of an exciting race on the league's shield with Ismaily, who became the top until the last two minutes of the season.

Al Ahly won the match 1-0 by Flavio goal and won the Egyptian league shield.
It was the last Portuguese championship for Manuel Jose during his second term before leaving and leaving the team's leadership to [[Hossam El-Badry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alahlyegypt.com/announcement/%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%8A%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9/|title=رحيل جوزيه بعد نهاية مثيرة – الموقع الرسمى للنادى الأهلى|first=|last=alahlyegypt|website=alahlyegypt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hossam Al-Badri managed to keep the shield in Al-Ahly's 2009–2010 cupboard to become the first national coach to win the league championship in 23 years, before Al Ahly won the Egyptian Super Cup by defeating [[Haras El Hodoud SC]] 1–0.
[[File:Al Ahly 2011.jpg|Al Ahly starting line up in 2011|thumbnail|right|250px]]
In the African Champions League, Al Ahly qualified for the semi-finals but was knocked out by [[Espérance Sportive de Tunis]] because of a famous referee [[Joseph Lamptey]] mistake that gave the hosts a win in the return game with a clear touch of hand goal by [[Michael Eneramo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alahlyegypt.com/announcement/%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%88%D8%B8%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A5%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82%D9%8A/|title=تفوق محلي وظلم إفريقي – الموقع الرسمى للنادى الأهلى|first=|last=alahlyegypt|website=alahlyegypt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sports activity in Egypt was postponed because of [[Port Said Stadium riot]]. In the first match after the return of sports activity, Ahly won the Egyptian Super Cup when defeated Enppi 2–1 in a sad match at the empty stadium of [[Borg El Arab Stadium]]. Despite the difficult events, the men of Al-Ahly overcame all circumstances and achieved the African Champions League for the seventh time when they beat Esperance in the Tunisian home 2-1 by [[Mohamed Nagy|Gedo]] and [[Walid Soliman (footballer)|Walid Soliman]], after finishing the first leg 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alahlyegypt.com/announcement/%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A3%D8%AC%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A1/|title=من أجل الشهداء – الموقع الرسمى للنادى الأهلى|first=|last=alahlyegypt|website=alahlyegypt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hossam Al-Badri left the team to [[Mohamed Youssef (football)|Mohamed Youssef]], who managed to complete the march successfully and lead Ahly to the African Champions League for the eighth time by beating South African [[Orlando Pirates]] 2–0 in the return match after a 1–1 draw. The return match was the last impression of the fans of the legend Mohamed Abotreka when he scored the first goal to be the last goal of his eternal journey in the red shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alahlyegypt.com/announcement/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%B1/|title=اللقب الثامن واعتزال الساحر – الموقع الرسمى للنادى الأهلى|first=|last=alahlyegypt|website=alahlyegypt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Ahly made his way to the African Confederations Cup after an early exit from the Champions League, but the Red Giant had a strong new impetus, which was the addition of this continental tournament to the club's first-ever cupboard. Indeed, Al Ahly reached the final against [[Séwé FC]] but lost the first game 2–1. In the return match, the draw went on until the sixth minute of stoppage time.
At a historic moment, Ahly's determination to win, [[Emad Moteab]] grabbed the goal of the coronation with a deadly
header that made every fan celebrating in Cairo stadium and made coach [[Juan Carlos Garrido]] running in Hysteria on the pitch.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Al Ahly fans 2016.jpg|Al Ahly fans before Egyptian super cup 2015|thumbnail|right|250px]] --&gt;

Usually the derby is played twice each season with two matches in the [[Egyptian Premier League]], but it is not uncommon to find the teams meeting each other in the [[Egypt Cup]], especially in the [[Egypt Cup#List of Finals|final]], and in Africa's most prestigious club competition, the [[CAF Champions League]].

==Name==
Amin Sami Pasha was the first one to propose the name of the Al Ahly Athletic Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ar..org/w/index.php?title=%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%87%D9%84%D9%8A_(%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1)&amp;oldid=24619917|title=النادي الأهلي (مصر)|date=24 September 2017|publisher=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Ahly was named because it was created to serve the students and graduates of the high schools who were the mainstay of the revolution against the English occupation.

Al Ahly formerly played their home games at their own ground, [[Mokhtar El-Tetsh Stadium]], but its capacity was too small for the club's support so they turned [[Mokhtar El-Tetsh Stadium]] to their Training Ground. As a consequence, Al-Ahly moved to play their home games at the [[Cairo International Stadium]]. Al Ahly stopped playing their home games at the [[Cairo International Stadium]] since 2014 for an indefinite period due to security reasons. In the [[2016–17 Egyptian Premier League|2016–2017]] season Al Ahly played most of their home games at [[Al-Salam Stadium (Cairo)|Al-Salam Stadium]] and played their matches in the African competitions at [[Borg El Arab Stadium]].At first leg of Egyptian League 2017-2018 AL Ahly returned to play at Cairo International Stadium.

{{Main|Al Ahly SC Stadium}}

== Kits and crest ==
{{Main|Al Ahly SC kit history}}
On November 3, 1917, Mohammed Sharif Sabri Bek, a member of the club, and King Farouk, designed the first logo for Al Ahly. It was an oval shape adorned with the crown of the Egyptian king at the upper end, symbolizing the royal rule of Egypt at the time. The eagle was shaved then changed to half red and half white and then became red only because of Egypt's flag at the time of the era of [[Abbas Hilmi II]].
The slogan was added in the celebration of Al Ahly being founded. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Some Alter Eco Fair Trade products include coffee, tea, rice, sugar, quinoa, chocolate, olive oil, juice and cotton balls. 

In 2006, Alter Eco France approached Brazilian retailers to sell Brazilian products in the country under Fair Trade terms, creating the first South-South Fair Trade experiment.

===During two World Wars===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
During [[World War I]], [[Armenians]] who fled from the [[Ottoman Empire]] to escape massive [[Armenian genocide|genocide]] led by Turkish troops against Armenian civilians, were officially accepted in [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|China]]. China agreed to allow them to stay and provided accommodation, food and churches. After the Turkish surrender, most Armenians chose to remain in China, due to the continuing crisis in the [[Caucasus]].

In [[World War II]], the Armenians joined the Chinese and [[Koreans]], and later, the [[Americans]] and [[English people|British]] forces, against [[Second Sino-Japanese war|Japanese invasion]]. Most Armenians followed [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Nationalist Revolutionary Army]], or joined the [[Eighth Route Army]] of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]], and resisted Japanese forces in Shanghai, Beiping, and other Chinese provinces. The Armenians lost a total 5,000 men.

===Cultural Revolution===
Since all religions were targeted by the [[Cultural Revolution]], many of churches and houses were destroyed, and most Armenians fled to [[Soviet Union]]'s Central Asia or [[India]]. The massive cultural revolution had decreased the number of Armenians in China down to less than 1000.

==Harbin==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
A limited number of Armenians settled in [[Manchuria]] during the construction of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] (KVZHD), undertaken by [[Imperial Russia]] in 1898. Their main settlement was in Harbin.

After the [[Russo-Japanese War]] the number of Armenians increased, which necessitated the creation of an Armenian National Organization for the purpose of helping their needy countrymen and the preservation of their national heritage.

The Armenian National Organization was headed by the Board of Directors, whose president for many years was Dr. [[C. G. Migdisov]], along with Mr. Ter-Ovakimov, an engineer with the KVZHD and Nr. Melik-Ogandjanov, an attorney.

The Armenian National Organization was founded in 1917. Its statute was approved by the local authorities in 1919. By 1923, they succeeded in building their own church and adjacent to it a social hall located on [[Sadovaya Street]]. Because most of the members of the Armenian colony lived in Harbin and had the only Armenian church in China, with residential quarters for their priest, Fr. [[Yeghishe Rostomiants]], the spiritual leader of all Armenians in Manchuria, China and [[Japan]], Harbin became the center of Armenians in China.

One of the main tasks of the Armenian Organization was to solve the problems of assistance to the needy members, such as the elderly, the poor, the orphans and generally all those who needed one or another kind of help in co-operation with Ladies Aid Group. The Board organized social events, staged national and literary plays, which was performed by the youth group in Armenian. On the national and religious holidays, tea parties were also organized. Classes to study Armenian language and literature also were held. The theatrical plays were performed at the prestigious Commercial Club and the Tchurin Club, where “Anahit” drama and Azerbaijani opera “Arshin-Mal-Alan “musical were performed, featuring the lead-singer, [[Karine Psakian]].

Until 1918, the city of Harbin had an Armenian House of Prayer in the district of [[Noviy Gored]].
In 1918, the KVZHD (Chinese Eastern Railroad) granted the Armenian Colony a piece of property on 18, Sadovaya Street, corner of [[Liaoyang Street]], where they began to build the Far-Eastern Armeno-Gregorian Church, which took several years to complete. The name “Far-Eastern” derived from the fact that Rev. Fr. Yeghishe Rostomiants and his family emigrated to Harbin from [[Vladivostok]], where evidently his church was closed. The church in Harbin began officially to function in the 1920s. In 1925, the Chinese Authorities registered it as the Armeno-Grigorian Church of Harbin. The church was erected in memory of [[St. Gregory the Illuminator]].

In 1932, Fr. Yeghishe Rostomiants died, leaving the church without a pastor and for several years thereafter the church and the premises were rented to the members of the [[Lutheran]] Congregation, who later built their own church. In 1937, thanks to the initiative and efforts of Mr. Ter-Ovakimov, President of the Armenian Organization, a priest was brought from [[Jerusalem]] - Rev. Fr. Assoghig Ghazarian. He had been educated in the monastery, after he was orphaned during the [[Armenian Genocide]]. At the time of his arrival in Harbin, he was only 27 years old. He was well-educated and spoke five languages. The Armenian Colony, numbering at the time about 350-400 people, felt very fortunate once again to have a pastor.

During the period of 1938-1950, Rev. Fr. Ghazarian, a building adjacent to the church was enlarged and renovated, thanks to the financial backing of large contributors and businessmen.
In 1950, Rt. Rev. Fr. Assoghig Ghazarian, who during [[World War II]] ended up in the concentration camp for [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] citizens in the city of [[Mukden]] returned to Jerusalem and the Armenian Church once again remained without a pastor.

Subsequently, during the following years, due to the mass-exodus of Armenians from Harbin, their colony dwindled down to a mere 40-50 people. In 1959, the building of the Armenian Church changed hands and became the property of the Chinese Government, which in turn used it for a textile factory. In August 1966, during the [[Cultural Revolution]], all churches in Harbin were demolished and all the treasures of the Armenian Church including icons and elaborate vestments were destroyed.

==Shanghai==
There is also much Armenian history in Shanghai. The [[Armenian Relief Society]] had a chapter in Shanghai as early as 1920.&lt;ref name="gulbenkian.pt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulbenkian.pt/inst/en/Activities/ArmenianCommunities?a=4845|title=Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian|work=gulbenkian.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the houses that were initially set out by the Armenian Relief Society that eventually became the Armenian Club of Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sergoyan.coffeetownpress.com/|title=E.G. Sergoyan's Blog|work=coffeetownpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was twofold: first, it helped refugees get settled in their new surroundings, but it then served as a meeting place for like-minded people to gather and swap stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorspectator.com/2012/03/30/review-tales-of-the-two-percenters-depict-armenian-community-in-china/|title=Review: Tales of the ‘Two-Percenters’ Depict Armenian Community in China|work=The Armenian Mirror-Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Communist takeover in 1949, most of the Armenians left China (mainly for San Francisco) and the community ended up being only 50 person strong. There is today an active chapter in Shanghai of the Armenian community of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityweekend.com.cn/shanghai/living/shanghai-armenian-society/|title=Armenian Club of Shanghai|author=infotec|work=cityweekend.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
There has been an Armenian community of various sizes in [[Hong Kong]] since the 19th century and many notable Armenians have left their mark, including [[Paul Chater|Sir Paul Catchik Chater]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Chater]]&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the second half of the 20th century, Hong Kong was a natural trading hub for many Armenians from all around the world and a small community was always present.

In November 2013, the community opened the Jack &amp; Julie Maxian Hong Kong Armenian Centre with more than 100 distinguished attendees including [[Karekin II|his Holiness Karekin II]] present for the opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfUBu0lQ91c|title=Opening of Jack &amp; Julie Maxian Hong Kong Armenian Center|date=29 November 2013|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The community regularly organizes events at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinahay.com/visitors-to-hong-kong/|title= ChinahayChinahay|work=chinahay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous Armenians in China==
* '''[[Paul Chater|Sir Paul Catchik Chater]]''' was born to Armenian parents in India in 1846. Orphaned at the age of eight, Chater received his education in Calcutta before arriving in Hong Kong in 1864. He became one of the most successful businessmen in the history of Hong Kong and is regarded for founding Hong Kong Land in 1889, that remains one of the largest and most prestigious companies of Hong Kong. In 1896, Chater was appointed to the Executive Council of Hong Kong and served there until his death in 1926. He was knighted in 1902. In 1904, he single-handedly financed the construction of St. Andrew’s Church in Kowloon that is still in use and bears a plaque to his honor. [[Chater Road]], [[Kennedy Town|Catchik Street]] and the office building [[Chater House]] are named after him.  A commemorative plaque that mentions his Armenian past can be found in Chater House.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azad-hye.net/news/viewnews.asp?newsId=285azkj10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ1rmvUOPRo|title=Unveiling of the Bust in Hong Kong - Sir Catchick Paul Chater September 2009 - Copy.mpg|date=10 December 2011|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Hovhannes Ghazarian|Professor Hovhannes Ghazarian]]''', an Armenian born and educated in Macau, was first to translate the Holy Bible into Chinese, in 1822.  Ghazarian (also known as Johannes Lassar), translated the Gospel by St. Matthew in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Claudius|title=Memoir of the Expediency of an Ecclesiastical Establishment for British India|date=1811|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, he travelled to Serampore (in current West Bengal, India) to continue working on the Bible. The New Testament was published in 1813, and the whole Bible was issued in 1822 by the liberality of the British and Foreign Bible Society. These editions are now recognized as the first known complete print [[Bible translations into Chinese|versions in Chinese]].

==Armenian community of China today==
There is a very active Armenian community in China today, commonly referred to as ChinaHay, composed of Armenians from all around the world.  There are currently around 500 individuals living mainly across the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinahay.com/about/what-is-chinahay/|title= ChinahayChinahay|work=chinahay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The community achieved important milestones in recent years with its formal incorporation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinahay.com/about/articles-of-association/|title= ChinahayChinahay|work=chinahay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; electing its first executive committee headed by President Henri Arslanian&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinahay.com/message-from-the-president/|title= ChinahayChinahay|work=chinahay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the opening of the Jack and Julie Maxian Hong Kong Armenian Centre in Hong Kong in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asbarez.com/116212/armenian-community-center-opens-in-hong-kong/|title=Armenian Community Center Opens in Hong Kong|work=Asbarez News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The community celebrated the first Armenian Mass in Mainland China in decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armenianweekly.com/2014/12/15/china/|title=Armenians Celebrate Mass in China for First Time in Decades|author=Hairenik|work=Armenian Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched a fellowship with the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] to research old Armenian history in China,&lt;ref name="gulbenkian.pt"/&gt; participated in the 1st Pan-Asian Armenian Gathering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asbarez.com/130710/first-ever-pan-asian-armenian-community-gathering-takes-place-in-bangkok/|title=First Ever Pan-Asian Armenian Community Gathering Takes Place in Bangkok|work=Asbarez News}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as offered Armenian classes across China and Asia in collaboration with the [[Armenian Virtual College]].

'''Asian Peruvians''', primarily [[Chinese Peruvians|Chinese]] and [[Japanese Peruvians|Japanese]], constitute some 5-7% of Peru's population, which in proportion to the overall population is one of the largest of any [[Latin American]] nation.

Peru has the second largest population of Japanese people in Latin America after [[Brazil]] and the largest population of Chinese people in [[Latin America]].

==East Asians==
Asian slaves, shipped from the [[Spanish Philippines]] to [[Acapulco]] (see [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleons]]), were all referred to as "Chino" meaning Chinese. In reality they were of diverse origins, including Japanese, Malays, Filipinos, Javanese, Timorese, and people from modern day Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Makassar, Tidore, Terenate, and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=BRILL|year=2010|location=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=acapulco+slaves++africa+india+malay+japan+timor+ternate+makassar#v=onepage&amp;q=acapulco%20slaves%20%20africa%20india%20malay%20japan%20timor%20ternate%20makassar&amp;f=false|page=12|title=The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean|isbn=9004182136|edition=illustrated|editor=Walton Look Lai|editor2=Chee Beng Tan|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herrera-Sobek2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herrera-Sobek|first=María|title=Celebrating Latino Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Cultural Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDIwZ8BieWcC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=11 July 2017|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34339-1|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann|year=1993|location=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=M25cDaIsFNYC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=acapulco+slaves+asian#v=onepage&amp;q=acapulco%20slaves%20asian&amp;f=false|volume=Volume 4 of Studien zur "Neuen Welt"|page=100|title=Slavery in the Americas|isbn=3884797131|edition=illustrated|editor=Wolfgang Binder|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Arnold J Meagher|year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H7dBmBsd-XgC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=slaves+manila+asiatics+acapulco+1635#v=onepage&amp;q=slaves%20manila%20asiatics%20acapulco%201635&amp;f=false|page=194|title=The Coolie Trade: The Traffic in Chinese Laborers to Latin America 1847-1874|isbn=1436309433|edition=|author=Arnold J.

Their total number is unknown due to high levels of assimilation. Both Filipinos and "native" Peruvians practice Catholicism and have a Hispanic culture and Spanish names. These factors facilitate assimilation.

===Chinese===
{{main|Chinese Peruvians}}
Historic communities inhabited by people of Chinese descent are found throughout the Peruvian [[upper Amazon]], including cities such as [[Yurimaguas]], [[Nauta]], [[Iquitos]] and the north central coast (Lambayeque and Trujillo). In contrast to the Japanese community in Peru, the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] appear to have intermarried much more since they came to work in the [[rice fields]] during the Viceroyalty and to replace the [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] slaves, during the abolition of slavery itself.

===Japanese===
{{main|Japanese Peruvians}}
Japanese immigrants arrived from [[Okinawa]]; but also from [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]], [[Hiroshima Prefecture|Hiroshima]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]] and [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]] prefectures. Many arrived as farmers or to work in the fields, but after their respective contracts were completed, settled in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Irie, Toraji. "History of the Japanese Migration to Peru," ''Hispanic American Historical Review.'' 31:3, 437-452 (August–November 1951); 31:4, 648-664 (no. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; In the period before World War II, the Japanese community in Peru was largely run by ''[[Issei]]'' immigrants born in Japan. "Those of the second generation", (the ''[[Nisei]]''), "were almost inevitably excluded from community decision-making."&lt;ref name="Higashide2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Higashide|first=Seiichi|title=Adios to Tears: The Memoirs of a Japanese-Peruvian Internee in U.S. Concentration Camps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORE5wfUNdccC&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=11 July 2017|year=2000|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-97914-4|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the statistics of [[South Korea]]'s [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]], Koreans in Peru formed Latin America's seventh-largest [[Korean diaspora]] community at 1,774 people {{as of|2005|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name="MOFAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okf.or.kr/data/status_SA.jsp|script-title=ko:재외동포현황 - 중남미|trans-title=Overseas Koreans - Latin America|language=ko|publisher=Overseas Korean Foundation|year=2005|accessdate=27 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212042443/http://www.okf.or.kr/data/status_SA.jsp|archivedate=12 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other groups==
[[Indians in Peru]] form a tiny minority in the country. The first immigrants from India to have arrived in Peru were businessmen who had gone there in the early 1960s. Later on, the community grew in number marginally until the early 1980s, after which many of its members left due to the severe local economic crises and the prevailing terrorism.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

An estimated 10,000 [[Palestinian Peruvian|Palestinians live in Peru]] alone, many of these families who arrived after the first Israel wars in 1948-49 had re-established and bettered themselves in Peru when it comes to socio-economic status.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The '''Bai language''' (Bai: {{lang|bca|Baip‧ngvp‧zix}}; {{zh|t=白語|s=白语|p=Báiyǔ}}) is a language spoken in [[People's Republic of China|China]], primarily in [[Yunnan]] province, by the [[Bai people]]. The language has over a million speakers and is divided into three or four main [[dialect]]s. Bai syllables are always open, with a rich set of [[vowel]]s and eight [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]. The tones are divided into two groups with [[modal voice|modal]] and non-modal ([[stiff voice|tense]], [[harsh voice|harsh]] or [[murmured voice|breathy]]) phonation. There is a small amount of traditional literature written with Chinese characters, Bowen ({{lang|zh-hans|僰文}}), as well as a number of recent publications printed with a recently standardized system of romanisation using the [[Latin alphabet]].

The origins of Bai have been obscured by intensive Chinese influence of an extended period. Different scholars have proposed that it is an early offshoot or sister language of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese]], part of the [[Loloish languages|Loloish branch]] or a separate group within the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] family.

Xu and Zhao (1984) divided Bai into three dialects, which may actually be distinct languages: [[Jianchuan County|Jianchuan]] (Central), [[Dali City|Dali]] (Southern), and Bijiang (Northern).{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=115}} Bijiang County has since been renamed as [[Lushui County]].{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=6}} Jianchuan and Dali are closely related, and speakers are reported to be able to understand one another after living together for a month.

The more divergent Northern dialects are spoken by about 15,000 Laemae (''{{IPA|lɛ˨˩mɛ˨˩}}'', Lemei, Lama), a clan numbering about 50,000 people who are partly submerged within the [[Lisu people|Lisu]].{{sfn|Bradley|2007|pp=363, 393–394}}
They are now designated as two languages by [[ISO 639-3]]:
* Panyi, spoken by people called ''Lemo'' ({{lang|zh-hans|勒墨}}) on the Nu River (upper [[Salween River|Salween]]) in Lushui county.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=31}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Change Request Documentation: 2013-006 | given = Eric | surname = Johnson | publisher = ISO 639-3 Registration Authority | year = 2013 | url = https://iso639-3.sil.org/request/2013-006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lama language (Bai)|Lama]], spoken by people called ''Lama'' ({{lang|zh-hans|拉玛}})  on the Lancang River (upper [[Mekong]]) in [[Lanping County]] and [[Weixi County]].{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=31}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Change Request Documentation: 2013-007 | given = Eric | surname = Johnson | publisher = ISO 639-3 Registration Authority | year = 2013 | url = https://iso639-3.sil.org/request/2013-007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The affiliation of Bai is obscured by over two millennia of influence from varieties of Chinese, leaving most of its lexicon related to Chinese etyma of various periods.{{sfn|Norman|2003|pp=73, 75}}
To determine its origin, researchers must first identify and remove from consideration the various layers of [[loanword]]s, and then examine the residue.{{sfn|Ramsey|1987|p=291}}
In his survey of the field, Wang notes that early work was hampered by a lack of data on Bai and uncertainties in the reconstruction of early forms of Chinese.{{sfn|Wang|2005|pp=102–107}}
Recent authors have suggested that Bai is an early offshoot from Chinese, a sister language to Chinese, or more distantly related (though usually still [[Sino-Tibetan]]).{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=73}}{{sfn|Wang|2005|pp=109–116}}

There are different tonal correspondences in the various layers.{{sfn|Lee|Sagart|2008|pp=7–8, 10, 12–13}}
Many words can be identified as later Chinese loans because they display Chinese [[sound change]]s from the last two millennia:{{sfn|Starostin|1995|pp=3–4}}
* [[labiodental consonant|labiodental]] [[fricative consonant|fricative]]s, which developed from earlier labial stops in certain environments.
* [[palatal consonant|palatal]] [[affricate consonant|affricate]]s from earlier [[velar consonant|velar]] stops in palatal environments.
* [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] stops from earlier voiced stops in words having the [[Middle Chinese]] level tone.
* the initial {{IPA|/l/}}, which developed from [[Old Chinese]] *r-.
Some of these changes date back to the first centuries AD.{{sfn|Starostin|1995|p=4}}

The oldest layer of Bai vocabulary with Chinese cognates, of which Wang lists some 250 words,{{sfn|Wang|2006|pp=205–211}} includes common Bai words that were also common in [[Classical Chinese]], but are not used in modern [[varieties of Chinese]].{{sfn|Gong|2015|p=2}}
Its features have been compared with current ideas on [[Old Chinese phonology]]:
* The voiceless nasals and lateral postulated for Old Chinese are absent,{{sfn|Wang|2006|pp=131, 144}} though in some cases the reflexes match those in western dialects of Han Chinese, rather than those of eastern dialects from which [[Middle Chinese]] and most modern varieties are descended.{{sfn|Gong|2015|p=11}}
* Where Middle Chinese has ''l-'', believed to be a reflex of Old Chinese *r, Bai varieties have {{IPA|j}} before {{IPA|i}}, {{IPA|n}} before a nasal final, and {{IPA|ɣ}} elsewhere.{{sfn|Starostin|1995|p=3}}{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=133}} However, in words where Middle Chinese ''l-'' corresponds to {{IPA|/s/}} in inland [[Min dialects]], Bai often has a stop initial, providing support for Baxter and Sagart's suggestion that such initials derive from clusters.{{sfn|Gong|2015|p=9}}
* Old Chinese *l- generally has similar palatal and dental reflexes in Bai and Middle Chinese, but seems to be preserved in a few Bai words.{{sfn|Starostin|1995|pp=4–5}}
* The Old Chinese finals *-aw and *-u merged in Middle Chinese syllables without a palatal medial by the 4th century AD, but are still distinguished in Bai.{{sfn|Starostin|1995|p=12}}{{sfn|Wang|2005|pp=110–111}}
* Several words with Old Chinese *-ts, which developed to ''-j'' with the departing tone in Middle Chinese, produce tonal reflexes in Bai corresponding to an original stop coda.{{sfn|Starostin|1995|p=2}}
[[Sergei Starostin]] suggests that these facts indicate a split from mainstream Chinese around the 2nd century BC, corresponding to the [[Western Han]] period.{{sfn|Starostin|1995|pp=2, 17}}{{sfn|Wang|2005|p=110}}
Wang argues that a few of the correspondences between his reconstructed Proto-Bai and Old Chinese cannot be explained by the Old Chinese forms, and that Chinese and Bai therefore form a Sino-Bai group.{{sfn|Wang|2006|pp=165–171}}
However, Gong suggests that at least some of these cases can be accounted for by refining the Proto-Bai reconstruction to take account of [[complementary distribution]] within Bai.{{sfn|Gong|2015|pp=4, 7}}

Starostin and [[Zhengzhang Shangfang]] have separately argued that the oldest Chinese layer accounts for all but an insignificant residue of Bai vocabulary, and that Bai is therefore an early branch of Chinese.{{sfn|Wang|2005|pp=110–111}}

On the other hand, Lee and Sagart (1998) argued that the various layers of Chinese vocabulary are loans, and that when they are removed, a significant non-Chinese residue remains, including 15 entries from the 100-word [[Swadesh list]] of basic vocabulary. They suggest that this residue shows similarities with [[Proto-Loloish language|Proto-Loloish]].{{sfn|Lee|Sagart|1998}}
[[James Matisoff]] (2001) argued that the comparison with Loloish is less persuasive when considering other Bai varieties than the Jianchuan dialect used by Lee and Sagart, and that it is safer to consider Bai as an independent branch of Sino-Tibetan, though perhaps close to the neighbouring Loloish.{{sfn|Matisoff|2001|p=39}}
Lee and Sagart (2008) refined their analysis, presenting the residue as a non-Chinese form of Sino-Tibetan, though not necessarily Loloish. They also note that this residue includes the Bai vocabulary relating to pig rearing and rice agriculture.{{sfn|Lee|Sagart|2008}}

Lee and Sagart's analysis has been further discussed by List (2009).{{sfn|List|2009}}
Gong (2015) suggests that the residual layer may be [[Qiangic languages|Qiangic]], pointing out that the Bai, like the Qiang, call themselves "white", whereas the [[Yi people|Lolo]] use "black".{{sfn|Gong|2015|p=2}}

== Phonology ==

The Gongxing and Tuolou dialects retain an older 3-way distinction for stop and affricate initials between voiceless unaspirated, voiceless aspirated and voiced. In the core eastern group, including the standard form of Dali, the voiced initials have become voiceless unaspirated, while other dialects show partial loss of voicing, conditioned by tone in different ways.{{sfn|Wang|2006|pp=58–72}}

Jianchuan finals comprise:{{sfn|Wiersma|2003|p=655}}
* pure vowels: {{IPA|i}} {{IPA|e}} {{IPA|ɛ}} {{IPA|ɑ}} {{IPA|o}} {{IPA|u}} {{IPA|v̩}} {{IPA|ɯ}}
* diphthongs: {{IPA|ɑo}} {{IPA|iɛ}} {{IPA|iɑ}} {{IPA|io}} {{IPA|iɯ}} {{IPA|ui}} {{IPA|uɛ}} {{IPA|uɑ}}
* triphthong: {{IPA|iɑo}}
All but {{IPA|u}}, {{IPA|ɑo}} and {{IPA|iɑo}} have contrasting [[nasal vowel|nasalized]] variants.
Dali Bai lacks nasal vowels.{{sfn|Wiersma|2003|p=655}}
Some other varieties retain nasal codas instead of nasalization, though only the Gongxing and Tuolou dialects have a contrast between {{IPA|-n}} and {{IPA|-ŋ}}.{{sfn|Wang|2006|pp=32–44, 74}}

Jianchuan has eight tones, divided between those with [[modal voice|modal]] and non-modal [[phonation]].{{sfn|Wiersma|2003|pp=655, 658}}
Some of the western varieties have fewer tones.{{sfn|Wang|2006|pp=32–44}}

== Grammar ==
Bai has a basic syntactic order of subject–verb–object ([[subject–verb–object|SVO]]). However, [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] word order can be found in interrogative and negative sentences.

== Writing system ==
The old Bai script used modified [[Chinese characters]], but its use was limited.{{sfn|Wang|2004|pp=278–279}}
A new script based on the [[Latin alphabet]] was designed in 1958, based on the speech of the urban centre of [[Xiaguan, Dali City|Xiaguan]], even though it was not a typical Southern dialect.{{sfn|Zhou|2012|pp=271, 273}}
The idea of romanization was controversial among Bai elites, and the system saw little use.{{sfn|Zhou|2012|p=110}}
In a renewed attempt in 1982, language planners used the Jianchuan dialect as a base, because it represented an area with a significant population, almost all of whom spoke Bai.
The new script was popular in the Jianchuan area, but was rejected in the more economically advanced area of Dali, which also had the largest number of speakers, albeit living alongside a large number of speakers of Chinese.{{sfn|Zhou|2012|p=273}}{{sfn|Wiersma|2003|pp=653–654}}
The script was revised extensively in 1993 to define two variants, representing Jianchuan and Dali respectively, and has since been more widely used.{{sfn|Zhou|2012|pp=273–274}}{{sfn|Wiersma|2003|p=654}}{{sfn|Wang|2004|p=279}}

The 1993 revision introduced variants ''ai''/''er'' etc, with the former to be used for Jianchuan Bai and the latter for Dali Bai.{{sfn|Zhou|2012|pp=272–273}}
In Jianchuan, all vowels but ''ao'', ''iao'', ''uo'', ''ou'' and ''iou'' have nasalized counterparts, denoted by a suffixed ''n''.{{sfn|Zhou|2012|p=272}}
Dali Bai lacks nasalized vowels.{{sfn|Wiersma|2003|p=655}}

Suffixed letters indicate tone contours and [[modal voice|modal]] or non-modal phonation.{{sfn|Zhou|2012|p=272}}{{sfn|Wiersma|1990|p=58}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5811">The '''Centre for Canadian Historical Horticultural Studies''' (CCHHS) includes archives and a program of scholarly study within [[Royal Botanical Gardens, Ontario]] ([[Hamilton, Ontario]] and [[Burlington, Ontario]]). It focuses on collecting and preserving literature, documents, and artifacts relevant to the history of horticulture in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Vrugtman, Ina. "Documenting Ornamental Horticulture in Canada: The Centre for Canadian Historical Horticultural Studies,"''Association for Living History, Farms, and Agricultural Museums Proceedings'', Vol. 9, 1989, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Royal Botanical Gardens began to accumulate literature on Canadian horticulture in the 1960s. In 1979 the CCHHS was formally established as a collaboration between Royal Botanical Gardens and the Dunington-Grubb Foundation. Ina Vrugtman, Royal Botanical Gardens' librarian, coordinated the work of the Centre until her retirement in 1995.

In 1984 the Centre co-sponsored the publication of Edwinna von Baeyer's book, ''Rhetoric and Roses: A History of Canadian Gardening''.&lt;ref&gt;Von Baeyer, Edwinna. ''Rhetoric and Roses: The History of Canadian Gardening'' (Markham: Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre published ''Canadian Horticultural History, An Interdisciplinary Journal'' as eight issues in three volumes between 1985 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Horticultural History: An Interdisciplinary Journal, Hamilton, Ont: Centre for Canadian Historical Horticultural Studies, Royal Botanical Gardens, Volumes 1-3, 1985-1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal covered topics on early Canadian botany, landscape architecture, and plant hybridisation.

Due to changes at Royal Botanical Gardens the scholarly program of the Centre was inactive for several years, although the archival collections continued to grow throughout this period.

The Centre also co-sponsored a 2017 workshop at York University exploring the role women played in botany and horticulture in nineteenth-century Canada called, Women, Men, and Plants in 19th-Century Canada: New Resources, New Perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Women, Men, and Plants in 19th-Century Canada: New Resources, New Perspectives, York University conference, October 19, 2017, http://cfr.info.yorku.ca/event/women-men-and-plants-in-19th-century-canada-new-resources-new-perspectives/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archival Holdings==

The CCHHS's collection encompasses resources relating to horticultural plants and their development and uses in Canada. Resources outlining the history of Canadian landscape design also form an important part of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;The Dunington-Grubb Centre for Studies in Canadian Historical Horticulture, ''Nursery Trades B.C.,''Vol. 1, No. 3, May/June, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these materials give a more technical account of Canadian horticulture, while others offer a larger view of social changes in Canadian society.

Special Collections:
*Horticultural and Nursery Trade Catalogues: With over 30,000 Canadian and international seed and nursery catalogues, the CCHHS has what is believed to be the largest collection in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Giaimo, Cara."The Treasures Blooming in Canada's Largest Seed Catalog Archive," ''Atlas Obscura'', November 22, 2017, https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/royal-botanical-gardens-canada-largest-seed-catalog-archive. Accessed January 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archival Fonds and Collections:
*The archive has records of notable men and women in horticulture including [[Isabella Preston]], Frank Palmer, Robert Keith, and [[Art Drysdale]], as well as records chronicling the history of Canadian horticultural education and horticultural societies and garden clubs.
**Ephemera: The archive has numerous clippings, booklets, articles, pamphlets, correspondences, and reports on various horticultural topics. 
**Special collections such as rare books: The archive is still actively collecting titles. 
**Photographs and slides: Including a collection of photographs from the landscape architecture practice of Howard and [[Lorrie Dunington-Grubb]] who started [[Sheridan Nurseries]], were among the founders of the [[Canadian Society of Landscape Architects]], as well as worked as successful landscape architects. 
**Horticultural Publications: Including the Canadian Horticulturist, Canadian Florist, and the Keith Florist Directories. 
**Manuscripts: Including an unpublished manuscript, ''The Garden of To-day'', written by Howard Dunington-Grubb
**Artifacts: Including the Hankinson Collection of over sixty late 19th and early 20th-century [[Hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]] vases.

[[Chronic fatigue syndrome]] (CFS) is an illness with a long history of controversy.

The diagnosis is controversial, and its [[etiology]] is still not fully understood. [[Alternative names for chronic fatigue syndrome|Alternative names]] to describe the condition(s) have been used over time throughout the world. Patient groups have criticized the name "chronic fatigue syndrome," saying it trivializes the illness.

A major divide still exists as to whether funding should be directed towards biomedical or psychological research.

==Naming==

{{main article | Alternative names for chronic fatigue syndrome}}

A 2007 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that patients prefer the terms ''myalgic encephalomyelitis'' or ''myalgic encephalopathy'' to "chronic fatigue syndrome". These patients believed the term ''fatigue'' trivializes the illness and discourages research into potential treatments.&lt;ref name="cfsyuppie"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/health/healthguide/esn-chronicfatigue-ess.html|title=Chronic Fatigue Syndrome No Longer Seen as ‘Yuppie Flu’|last=Tuller|first=D|date=17 July 2007|work=The New York Times|accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a survey of medical trainees at a school in the United States, a condition described as "chronic fatigue syndrome" may be considered less serious than a condition described as "myalgic encephalopathy".&lt;ref name = "pmid11928774"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jason LA, Taylor RR, Plioplys S, Stepanek Z, Shlaes J | title = Evaluating attributions for an illness based upon the name: chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic encephalopathy and Florence Nightingale disease | journal=Am J Community Psychol | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 133–48 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11928774 | doi = 10.1023/A:1014328319297| last2 = Taylor | last3 = Plioplys | last4 = Stepanek | last5 = Shlaes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a paper reported that the majority of the CFS patients questioned in a survey wanted the name changed from chronic fatigue syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Jason | first = L | author2 = Holbert C; Torres-Harding S; Taylor RR | year = 2004 | title = Stigma and the Term Chronic Fatigue Syndrome | journal=Journal of Disability Policy Studies | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 222–228 | doi = 10.1177/10442073040140040401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition===
Historically, many professionals within the medical community were unfamiliar with CFS, or they did not recognize it as a real condition, and disagreed on its prevalence or seriousness.&lt;ref name = "pmid1794092"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "pmid9231495" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jason LA, Richman JA, Friedberg F, Wagner L, Taylor R, Jordan KM | title = Politics, science, and the emergence of a new disease.

Education of care providers is a proposed solution. One study conducted a relatively brief seminar presenting factual information on CFS to a cohort of fourth year medical students.

===Contrasting viewpoints===
There has been much disagreement over proposed cause(s), diagnosis, and treatment of the illness.&lt;ref name = "pmid8856816"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sharpe M | title = Chronic fatigue syndrome | journal=Psychiatr.

One influential 1993 Lancet paper argued that CFS was a form of [[neurasthenia]] to be classified as a psychiatric condition, and a subsequent 1998 paper concluded that behavioral, cognitive, and affective factors all played a role in perpetuating fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=David A, Wessely S | title = Chronic fatigue, ME, and ICD-10 | journal=[[The Lancet]] | volume = 342 | issue = 8881 | pages = 1247–8 | year = 1993 | pmid = 7901572 | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(93)92234-K| last2 = Wessely }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Vercoulen | first = JHMM |author2=Swanink CMA |author3=Galama JMD |author4=Fennis JFM |author5=Jongen PHJ |author6=Hommes OR |author7=Van der Meer JWM |author8= Bleijenberg G  | year = 1998 | title = The persistence of fatigue in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple sclerosis: Development of a model | pmid = 9859853 | issue = 6| journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research | volume = 45 | pages = 507–517 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3999(98)00023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a 2005 population-based study, which used a similar methodology to the earlier 1998 study, found important differences between CFS and psychiatrically explained chronic fatigue which could affect the development of therapy and explanatory models. They concluded that the 1998 model adequately represented chronic fatigue secondary to psychiatric conditions, but not CFS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Song | first = S |author2=Jason LA | year = 2005 | title = A population based study of CFS experienced in differing patient groups.

Contested causation may have serious negative effects on healthcare for individuals, as it may erode patient-provider trust, test the provider's self-assurance and capacity to share power with the patient, and raise problematic issues of reparation, compensation and blame.&lt;ref name = "pmid12194900"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Engel CC, Adkins JA, Cowan DN | title = Caring for medically unexplained physical symptoms after toxic environmental exposures: effects of contested causation | journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives|Environ.

===PACE trial===

{{main article | Chronic fatigue syndrome treatment#PACE_trial}}

PACE was a large trial investigating the efficacy and safety of four treatments adjunctive to specialist medical care (SMC): [[cognitive behavioural therapy]] (CBT), [[graded exercise therapy]] (GET), and [[adaptive pacing therapy]] (APT). The results were published in February 2011 and concluded that CBT and GET were each "moderately" effective compared to SMC alone, while APT was not found to be effective when added to SMC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = P. | last2 = Goldsmith | first2 = K. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = A. | last4 = Potts | first4 = L. | last5 = Walwyn | first5 = R. | last6 = Decesare | first6 = J. | last7 = Baber | first7 = H. | last8 = Burgess | first8 = M. | last9 = Clark | first9 = L. | last10 = Cox | first10 = D.

The trial generated considerable adverse criticism. [[Letter to the editor|Letters to the editor]] critiqued the definitions of secondary outcomes, questioned post-hoc protocol changes, and expressed concern over generalisability of the results. Patient groups and the IACFS/ME (an organization of researchers and health care professionals interested in CFS) &lt;ref&gt;"IACFS/ME Statement on the PACE Trial: The Issue of Illness 'Reversal'", 24 February 2011, The International Association for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ME (IACFS/ME), {{cite web |url=http://www.iacfsme.org/PACETrial/tabid/450/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718151623/http://www.iacfsme.org/PACETrial/tabid/450/Default.aspx |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; criticized the trial for over-simplified and exaggerated conclusions, for using a flawed psychosocial illness model that ignores biological evidence, for testing a non-representative version of pacing, and because the results seriously conflict with their member surveys which show that pacing is effective and CBT or GET can cause deterioration in many patients who use the treatments.&lt;ref&gt;"PACE: 'surprising and disappointing'", 18 February 2011, Action for ME, http://www.afme.org.uk/news.asp?newsid=1047&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"ME Association press statement about the results of the PACE study", Tony Britton for the ME Association, 18 February 2011, http://www.meassociation.org.uk/?p=4607&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Falling off the PACE", Kimberly McCleary, [undated (Retrieved 26 July 2011)], The CAA (CFIDS Association of America), {{cite web|url=http://www.cfids.org/pdf/lancet-analysis.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625051513/http://cfids.org/pdf/lancet-analysis.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable researcher submitted a 442-page letter to the Medical Research Council outlining his criticisms of the trial, and a shorter 43-page complaint to the ''Lancet''. The MRC and the ''Lancet'' rejected the submissions. A ''Lancet'' editorial responded to the adverse criticism by suggesting that some critics could be part of "an active campaign to discredit the research."&lt;ref name="PMID 21592553"&gt;{{cite journal | author=[No authors listed] (Editorial) | title = Patients' power and PACE | journal=Lancet | volume = 377 | issue = 9780 | pages = 1808 |date=May 2011 | pmid = 21592553 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60696-X | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2960696-X/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID 21697226"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hawkes N | title = (Editorial) Dangers of research into chronic fatigue syndrome | journal=BMJ | volume = 342 | pages = d3780 |date=June 2011 | pmid = 21697226 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.d3780 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d3780.extract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent criticisms of the trial have come from the scientific community. For example, biostatistician Bruce Levin of Columbia University described the study as "the height of clinical trial amateurism," and Ronald Davis of Stanford University wrote, “I’m shocked that the Lancet published it…The PACE study has so many flaws and there are so many questions you’d want to ask about it that I don’t understand how it got through any kind of peer review.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.virology.ws/2015/11/13/an-open-letter-to-dr-richard-horton-and-the-lancet/|title=An open letter to Dr. Richard Horton and The Lancet|website=www.virology.ws|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an analysis of the study's design, the mathematician Professor Rebecca Goldin wrote that "There were problems with the study on almost all levels... the flaws in this design were enough to doom its results from the start."&lt;ref&gt;"PACE: The research that sparked a patient rebellion and challenged medicine", Sense About Statistics, 21 March 2016 http://www.stats.org/pace-research-sparked-patient-rebellion-challenged-medicine/&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Jonathan Edwards of University College London (UCL) has written that the PACE trial "is an unblinded trial with subjective outcome measures. That makes it a non-starter in the eyes of any physician or clinical pharmacologist familiar with problems of systematic bias in trial execution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1359105317700886|title=PACE team response shows a disregard for the principles of science|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for patients==
A 2006 investigation by a group from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] found there was not enough support in the UK for CFS patients in terms of access to government benefits and health care.&lt;ref name = "pmid16935965"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gibson I |title=A new look at chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis |journal=J.

Institutions maintain the exclusion of patient support by rhetorical arguments of the open-endedness of science to delay new findings of fact.

==Research funding==
In 1998 it became known almost 13 million dollars for CFS research had been redirected or improperly accounted for by the United States CDC.

However, the idea that CFS may be culturally mediated persisted in some quarters. In her 1997 book ''Hystories: Hysterical Epidemics and Modern Culture,'' literary critic and feminist [[Elaine Showalter]] argues that chronic fatigue syndrome is a "hysterical narrative," a modern manifestation of [[hysteria]], a self-perpetuating "cultural symptom of anxiety and stress" historically assigned to women.&lt;ref name="showalter"&gt;{{cite book | author=Showalter, Elaine | title = Hystories: hysterical epidemics and modern media | publisher=Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 1997 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=lTL34npiiV0C&amp;pg=PA115 132] | isbn = 0-231-10459-6 | oclc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political==
A 2006 report by the UK Parliamentary Group on Scientific Research into Myalgic Encephalomyelitis stated that: "CFS/ME is defined as a psychosocial illness by the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (DWP) and medical insurance companies. Therefore, claimants are not entitled to the higher level of benefit payments. We recognise that if CFS/ME remains as one illness and/or both remain defined as psychosocial then it would be in the financial interest of both the DWP and the medical insurance companies." The Group called for investigation of what they called, "numerous cases where advisors to the DWP have also had consultancy roles in medical insurance companies. Particularly the Company [[Unum|UNUMProvident]]. Given the vested interest private medical insurance companies have in ensuring CFS/ME remain classified as a psychosocial illness there is blatant conflict of interest here." The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions responded that "Entitlement to Disability Living Allowance depends on the effects that severe physical or mental disability has on a person's need for personal care and/or their ability to walk, and not on particular disabilities or diagnoses. The
benefit is available to people with myalgic encephalomyelitis (which can have a physical basis or a psychological basis, or can be due to a combination of factors) on exactly the same terms as other severely disabled people, and they can qualify for it provided that they meet the usual entitlement conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=United Kingdom Parliamentary Group on Scientific Research into Myalgic Encephalomyelitis | title = Inquiry into the status of CFS/ME and research into causes and treatment | date = 1 November 2006 | url = http://erythos.com/gibsonenquiry/Report.html | accessdate =25 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Researcher harassment ==
Researchers who advocate classifying CFS as a psychosocial illness have been criticized by those who believe that their work draws attention and funding away from research into biomedical treatments. In 2012, several prominent UK researchers adopting the psychosocial perspective reported to the press that they had been verbally abused by patients, and one reported receiving death threats.&lt;ref name="hawkes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hawkes|first1=N.|title=Dangers of research into chronic fatigue syndrome|journal=BMJ|date=22 June 2011|volume=342|issue=jun22 1|pages=d3780–d3780|doi=10.1136/bmj.d3780|pmid=21697226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cosmopolitan Club of Philadelphia''' is a [[gentlemen's club|private social club]] in [[Philadelphia]]. It was founded in June 1928 by a group of women from Philadelphia and its surroundings.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;[http://www.cosclub.org The Cosmopolitan Club of Philadelphia - Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1930, the members had purchased the lot at 1616 Latimer Street, and oversaw the construction of an [[Art Deco]] building.&lt;ref name="official"/&gt;

The members of the Cosmopolitan Club of Philadelphia are all women, and they  represent a wide array of ages, races, cultures, interests, skills, professions and affiliations.&lt;ref name="official"/&gt;

They work and volunteer in the community. Thirty-eight of the Club's past and present members have been named Distinguished Daughters of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dgs.state.pa.us/dgs/lib/dgs/pa_manual/section9/distinguished_daughters_of_pennsylvania.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crime in Guyana''' is investigated by Guyana's police.

== Crime by type ==

=== Murder ===
{{Further|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

In 2012, Guyana had a murder rate of 17.0 per 100 000 population.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; There were a total of 135 murders in Guyana in 2012.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''. [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic violence ===
{{Further|Domestic violence in Guyana}}

Domestic violence is a problem in all [[regions of Guyana]]. Enforcement of the domestic violence laws is especially weak in the interior, where police do not have as strong a presence and courts meet only once a quarter.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78894.htm Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Guyana]. [[United States]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (March 6, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NGOs]] report a widespread perception that some police officers and magistrates could be [[bribed]] to make cases of domestic violence "go away." The government also does not prosecute cases in which the alleged victim or victim's family agreed to drop the case in exchange for a monetary payment [[Settlement (litigation)|out of court]]. NGOs assert the need for a specialized Family Court.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== Robbery ===
Armed robberies occur regularly, especially in businesses and shopping districts, especially in the capital [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=16163 "Guyana 2014 Crime and Safety Report", Overseas Security Advisory Council, US State Department, 15 August 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; Nationally, there were 512 robberies under arms during the period January to October 2012 (a 15% increase from 2011).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/guyana/safety-and-security "Guyana travel advice - Safety and security", United Kingdom Government foreign travel advice.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== By location ==
=== Georgetown ===
In Georgetown, high crime areas include Tiger Bay, Albouystown, Sophia, all of south Georgetown, [[Buxton, Guyana|Buxton]] and Agricola.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/guyana/safety-and-security "Guyana travel advice - Safety and security", United Kingdom Government foreign travel advice.]&lt;/ref&gt; Robberies are a daily occurrence in the [[Stabroek Market]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/guyana/safety-and-security "Guyana travel advice - Safety and security", United Kingdom Government foreign travel advice.]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of assaults have taken place in the Botanic Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/guyana/safety-and-security "Guyana travel advice - Safety and security", United Kingdom Government foreign travel advice.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2198">[[Esperanto]] has a small presence in [[Malaysia]] although no [[Esperanto]] associations or clubs are there.

==Activity in the 2010s==

A school club operated at the San Min Chinese Independent School, which is in [[Teluk Intan]], [[Perak]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanyang.com/node/415512 San Min Independent School]&lt;/ref&gt; but was discontinued in 2014.

The Tsung Wah Old Students' Association was a CEFR 2012 Worldwide Written test center in [[Kuala Kangsar]], Perak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loyarburok.com/2012/06/28/introducing-1st-esperanto-examination-center-malaysia/ First Esperanto Test Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

JCI, Teluk Intan branch conducted an elementary course in March, 2012.

[[Aik Keow Chinese Primary School]] in [[Teluk Air Tawar]], [[Seberang Prai]], [[Penang]] held a 3-hour introductory course for 20 pupils during the school holidays in November, 2012.

Aik Keow Ex-pupils' Association in Teluk Air Tawar, Seberang Prai, Penang conducted a 4-hour Introductory course for the members as well as non members in December, 2012

==Reasons for the lack of popularity==

*Local media rarely cover related activities. Coverage in Chinese-language media is mainly on local pages.
*''Loyar Burok'' is the only strong supporter of Esperanto activities in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loyarburok.com/2012/10/31/join-masthead/ LoyarBurok]&lt;/ref&gt;

==125-year celebration==

*Esperanto Club of San Min in Teluk Intan-o issued 4 sets of commemorate stamps.
*Esperanto Club of San Min, Junior Chamber International (JCI), Teluk Intan branch and simpla-vivo.com printed 1000 postcards.
*Malaysia Esperanto Studies Group (MESG) printed 4,000 postcards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mesg2012.blogspot.com MESG-O]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In conjunction with its 10th Anniversary, Universiti Tuanku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) arranged a talk by Sinjoro ENG on the Perak main campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utar.edu.my UTAR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the film is a reference to the generations of older LGBT people who remain in the closet or re enter the closet out of concern for their safety or quality of life. As a result of the documentary, the term Gen Silent has increased in use as a way to refer to this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Knauer | first=Nancy J. | title=Gen Silent – Advocating For LGBT Elders | publisher=Illinois Law Center | date=11 January 2012| url=http://www.law.illinois.edu/elderlaw/issues/vol_19/num_2/pdfs/Knauer.pdf| accessdate = 29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

''Gen Silent'' was filmed in the Boston area over a one-year period.

She searches for people to care for her because she is estranged from her family. The story of an LGBT couple named Sheri and Lois is told, including how they spent their lives fighting for LGBT rights. While Sheri states that she refuses to hide her sexuality, Lois states that she will if that is what it would take to protect her in the health care system. Mel and his partner are the final couple followed in the documentary. Mel’s partner gets sick and he finds care from a welcoming agency where he feels comfortable and safe to speak openly for the first time about his sexuality and their thirty-nine year relationship together.&lt;ref name="UONC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= | first= | title=Gen Silent – The People| publisher=Gen Silent Official Website| date=| url=http://stumaddux.com/gen_silent_people.html| accessdate = 23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2886">'''Global public policy networks''' ('''GPPNs''') are what may be considered a new actor in the stage of world affairs. A non-state entity in that they are not states, and not necessarily incorporated in the legal sense, they may take on an international role, even without the formal status of an international or multilateral organization/institution. These networks are comprised by various actors from civil society, governments, government agencies, industry, industry groups, and perhaps multilateral organizations/institutions.  Their activities cover the range of steps in the policy process, beyond to policy proposals or [[lobbying]], including agenda setting, policy formulation, negotiation, rule making, coordination, implementation, and evaluation.  Their expertise can often play an important role in global debates and [[Social norm|norm]] establishment.

The basis for scholarship on GPPNs can be seen to be set by [[Robert Keohane]] and [[Joseph Nye]], as well as [[Anne-Marie Slaughter]] in the United States.  While their status and role in the development of [[Social norm|norms]] in the transnational sphere can be understood through work on  "hard" and "soft" law including [[Kenneth W. Abbott]], and [[Jon Birger Skjærseth]]. Further scholarship on their role in global governance includes work by Diane Stone.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Diane. ''Knowledge Actors and Transnational Governance: The Private-public Policy Nexus in the Global Agora''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Examples of GPPNs include:  The [[World Commission on Dams]], the [http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/ International Competition Network], the [[Global Water Partnership]], the [[Medicines for Malaria Venture]] (which has since become a foundation), the [[Internet &amp; Jurisdiction Policy Network]], and [[REN21]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2334">The '''Granddad Bandit''' is a serial [[Bank Robber|bank robber]], notable for both his age and proficiency at robbing banks. From 2008 to 2010, he robbed at least 21 banks in the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] and [[Central United States|Central]] [[United States]]. He was nicknamed the "Granddad Bandit" because of his age, appearance, and manner of dress. He robs bank by handing a note demanding cash to the teller. He did not use a disguise during the robberies other than sometimes wearing a hat. He was wanted in 12 states and by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].  He surrendered peacefully on August 13, 2010 after a 6-hour standoff with police and FBI agents.  He was positively identified as 52-year-old '''Michael Francis Mara'''. At 18, Mara was convicted of  embezzlement, grand larceny and other charges. He also pretended to be a sheriff when he rented a car but never returned it. In 1985, he robbed a bank in California. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison on May 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Daily Mail]] | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1386017/25-years-Grandad-Bandit-bank-robber-Michael-Mara.html | title=25 years for the 'Grandad Bandit' who robbed banks in 13 states ... and didn't bother with a disguise | date=May 12, 2011 | accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He should not be confused with the "'''Grandpa Bandit'''", a different man who robbed 7 banks in [[Oregon]] in late 2009, and has since been caught.

The '''Guane''' were a [[South America]]n '''people''' that lived mainly in the area of [[Santander Department|Santander]] and north of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], both departments of present-day central-[[Colombia]]. They were [[farmers]] cultivating [[cotton]], [[pineapple]] and other crops, and skilled [[artisans]] working in cotton textiles. The Guane lived north of the [[Chicamocha River]], around the [[Chicamocha Canyon]] in an area stretching from [[Vélez, Santander|Vélez]] in the south to the capital of Santander; [[Bucaramanga]] in the north.&lt;ref name=TodaColombia&gt;{{es}} [http://www.todacolombia.com/etnias-de-colombia/grupos-indigenas/guane.html Guane people and their territories]&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state their territory did not extend so far north.&lt;ref name=Espectador&gt;{{es}} [http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/nacional/asi-eramos-los-guanes-articulo-260576 Reconstruction of the Guane people] - [[El Espectador]]&lt;/ref&gt; Guane, a [[corregimiento]] of [[Barichara]], Santander, is said to have been the capital of the Guane people.

== Etymology ==
The word ''guane'' in the [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] of the people means "tree" or "lower part of a leaf", or "skirt".&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://muysca.cubun.org/guane ''guane''] - Chibcha dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://muysca.cubun.org/guane(2) ''guane (2)''] - Chibcha dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Guane made their own weapons, including arrows and spears. They interchanged plants for the stewpot with the [[Chitarero people|Chitarero]] on the east and the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] to the south of their territories. The mantle making of the Guanes was well known in [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Colombia. Mantles made from cotton have been dated back to the 11th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.colarte.com/colarte/conspintores.asp?idartista=5776 Guane people and their mantle making]&lt;/ref&gt; The Guane cultivated [[tobacco]] and made products of [[fique]].&lt;ref name=TodaColombia/&gt;

Like the [[Maya people|Maya]] and many other civilizations in the world, the Guane deliberately [[cranial deformation|deformed the skulls]] of their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.eldoradocolombia.com/deformacion_craneos.html Cranial deformation of the Guane and other cultures worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1586 there were still some Guane left but there were no further references found after that date; nevertheless, the local archives indicated that they did not disappear completely. They mixed heavily with the Spanish colonizers, as the Guane were said to have European traits and very light skin.&lt;ref name=Blog&gt;{{es}} [http://elguane.blogspot.com.co/2011/09/el-aspecto-fisico-guane.html Physical aspects of the Guane people]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Muisca, [[U'wa people|U'wa]] and Lache, the Guane spoke a [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan]] language.&lt;ref name=Espectador/&gt; They adored [[Bochica]], the messenger god in the [[Muisca religion]].&lt;ref name=Misterio&gt;{{es}} [http://misteriosconxana.blogspot.com.co/2016/01/los-guanes-colombia.html Description of the Guane people and their culture]&lt;/ref&gt; The Guane traded with their neighbouring indigenous groups; Lache to the east, U'wa to the northeast, Muzo to the south and Muisca to the southeast.

[[Rock art]] produced by the Guane have been found around the Chicamocha Canyon and on the [[Mesa de los Santos]], Santander.&lt;ref name=Misterio/&gt;

The Guane people chewed [[coca]] combined with calcitic grains, using [[poporo]]s.&lt;ref name=Misterio/&gt;

== Municipalities belonging to Guane territory ==
The Guane inhabited the area of central and south Santander, around the [[Chicamocha Canyon]] and a small part of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]].

After the success of ''Arabian Nights'' Universal requested a series of films starring Montez, Hall and Sabu. It was followed by ''White Savage'' and ''Cobra Woman''. The studio then requested three more, ''Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves'', a gypsy tale, ''Zorya'', and a tale of the modernisation of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SCREEN AND STAGE|author=|work=Los Angeles Times |date=16 May 1943|page=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SCREEN NEWS HERE AND IN HOLLYWOOD: Joan Crawford Gets 6 Months' Leave of Absence From Metro After Casting Dispute TWO FILMS OPEN TODAY 'Next of Kin,' British Drama, at Rialto -- 'Johnny Doughboy' Will Be Seen at Palace|author=Telephone to THE NEW YORK TIMES.|work=New York Times |date=5 May 1943|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Hogan was signed to write and direct ''Zorya'' which became ''Gypsy Girl'' then ''Gypsy Wildcat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Of Local Origin|author=|work=New York Times |date=9 June 1943|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fell ill so he was replaced by [[Roy William Neill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SCREEN NEWS|author=Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES.|work=New York Times |date=29 Sep 1943|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; James M Cain was hired to work on the dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SCREEN NEWS HERE AND IN HOLLYWOOD: Helen Walker to Be Featured With Nils Asther in 'The Man in Half Moon Street' JEANNIE' ARRIVES TODAY Comedy Will Be at Carnegie -- Selznick Pays $125,000 for Rights to 'So Little Time'|author=Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES.|work=New York Times |date=11 Sep 1943|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Tonio was meant to be played by [[Turhan Bey]]. However he was loaned at the last minute to MGM to play a role in ''[[Dragon Seed (film)|Dragon Seed]]'' and was replaced by Peter Coe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SCREEN NEWS HERE AND IN HOLLYWOOD: Turhan Bey, Czech Actor, Will Appear Opposite Katharine Hepburn in 'Dragon Seed'|author=Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES.|work=New York Times |date=2 Oct 1943|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coe was a former swimming champion, Acquacade performer and stage actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DRAMA AND FILM: Sacrosanct Chaplin Studio Stage Invaded Long Hiatus in Lana Turner Career Approaching End; Coe Gets Bey Role|author=Schallert, Edwin|work=Los Angeles Times |date=4 Oct 1943|page=A8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed that he and Montez had an affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/CultMovies08Starbrite/page/n58?q=%22maria+montez%22|page=58|title=Peter Coe Interview|website=Cult Movies Starbrite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"My other pictures were just corn", said Montez. "This one is more golden bantam. I'm tired of being a fairy tale princess all the time. In every picture I have royal blood. I told the studio I wanted to do something else. I thought everything was fixed when they put me in ''Gypsy Wildcat''. But do you know what happens at the end of that picture?

'''Hui'an maidens''' or '''Hui'an women''' ({{zh|c=惠安女|p=Huì'ān nǚ|poj=Hūi-oaⁿ cha-bó͘}}) are a major [[Han Chinese]] subgroup that are a part of a distinct Han community residing in [[Hui'an County]] of [[Quanzhou]], [[Fujian]], [[China]]. They have a distinct dress and marital customs that have been the focus of both anthropologists and governmental censure.{{sfn|Tsai|2004|p=98}}

==History==
The Hui'an are categorized as Han Chinese as they speak Sinitic languages, adopted Han culture, and practise Chinese religions but their origin traces back to the ancient [[Minyue]] people of more than two thousand years ago. The isolation on the eastern peninsula of Hui'an prevented Hui'an maidens from completely assimilating into the Han culture, so many of their distinctive customs and traditions still survive today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ispeakmin.com/bbs/archiver/?tid-2907.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://m.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/xhtml1/news/newsmakers/16/7991-1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Baiyue]] peoples who continue to retain a cultural distinction from the Han despite adopting many of their practises and now speak a Sinitic language include the [[Tanka people]] and [[Pinghua]].

==Culture==
[[File:Huian maiden statue.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Hui'an maidens, taken in [[Quanzhou]], [[Fujian]], [[China]].]]
=== Costumes ===
[[File:Modemuseum Antwerpen.jpg|thumb|Knitwear exhibition ONTRAFEL at the Modemuseum Antwerpen (MoMu), [[Belgium]]. The central design is a dress by [[Walter van Beirendonck]], inspired by the colourful clothing of the Hui'an women.]]

Typical Hui'an maidens wear short cyan jackets and skintight black hiphuggers which flare out at the legs and they cover their heads with colorful scarves and [[Asian conical hat|conical hats]]. The government describes them as having "feudal heads, thrifty jackets, democratic bellies, and wasteful trousers",&lt;ref name="ChinaCulture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2006-04/29/content_81491.htm|title=Hui'an Women|publisher=ChinaCulture.org|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of a project to forcibly assimilate the Hui'an community since the early days of the People's Republic.{{sfn|Tsai|2004|p=98}}

=== Marriage ===
Hui'an maidens have very distinct customs regarding their marriage. Newlyweds are not allowed to stay together on their wedding night, so the groom stays in a friend's house. On the second day, the bride pays respects to the groom's family and gives gifts to the elders. On the third day, the groom's sister leads the bride to the communal well to draw two buckets of water. After five days of obeying various customs, she returns to her parents' home. The bride and groom are forbidden to live together or even talk to each other until the bride bears a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=William N. |title=Discover Quanzhou |date=2007 |publisher=厦门大学出版社 |isbn=9787561521069 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younger generations no longer practice these customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinavista.com/experience/huian/huian.html|title=Unique Chinese Customs in Hui'an, Fujian Province|author=Qiu Huanxing, Lu Zhongmin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaexpat.com/2009/03/05/dont-get-married-in-hui-an.html/|title=Don't Get Married in Hui'an|date=5 March 2009|publisher=China Expat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The majority of the Hui'an people have the same religious practices as other Han Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=18475&amp;rog3=CH|title=Han Chinese, Hui'an in China Ethnic People Profile|publisher=Joshua Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21352">There has been significant [[immigration]] to [[Switzerland]] since the 1980s.
By contrast, during the 19th century, [[emigration from Switzerland]] was more common, as Switzerland was economically a [[poverty in Switzerland|poor country]] where a large fraction of population survived on [[subsistence farming]].

The largest immigrant groups in Switzerland are those from [[Italian immigration to Switzerland|Italy]], 
[[German immigration to Switzerland|Germany]], the [[Immigration from Former Yugoslavia to Switzerland|Former Yugoslavia]], [[Albanians in Switzerland|Albania]], [[Portuguese in Switzerland|Portugal]] and [[Turkey]] ([[Turks in Switzerland|Turks]] and [[Kurds]]). Between them, these six groups account for about 1.5 million people, 60% of the Swiss population with immigrant background, or close to 20% of total Swiss population.

The current federal law of December 16, 2005, on foreigners (the Foreign Nationals Act) came into force on January 1, 2008, replacing the Federal Act on the Residence and Establishment of Foreigners of 1931.&lt;ref name=msgrel&gt;{{cite web |title=Message relatif à l’initiative populaire "Contre l’immigration de masse" |url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/federal-gazette/2013/279.pdf |publisher=Chancellerie fédérale |location=Berne, Switzerland |format=PDF |pages=289–290 |language=French |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Switzerland]] and [[Australia]], with about a quarter of their population born outside the country, are the two countries with the highest proportion of immigrants in the western world, although who counts as an immigrant varies from country to country, and even between agencies within countries. Some countries naturalise immigrants easily, while others make it much more difficult, which means that such comparisons ought to be treated with caution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jacques |last=Neirynck |title=Pour son bien-être, la Suisse doit rester une terre d’immigration |url=http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/b615bb7a-da5a-11e0-ba12-6c1a991db705/Pour_son_bien-%C3%AAtre_la_Suisse_doit_rester_une_terre_dimmigration |work=[[Le Temps]] |location=Geneva, Switzerland |date=9 September 2011 |language=French |accessdate=2014-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141119002114/http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/b615bb7a-da5a-11e0-ba12-6c1a991db705/Pour_son_bien-%C3%AAtre_la_Suisse_doit_rester_une_terre_dimmigration |archivedate=19 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/migration-outlook_switzerland-has-highest-number-of-immigrants/41145410 "Switzerland has highest number of immigrants"], [[Swissinfo]], 1 December 2014 (page visited on 13 June 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blinder|first=Scott|date=2013-06-17|title=Imagined Immigration: The Impact of Different Meanings of ‘Immigrants’ in Public Opinion and Policy Debates in Britain|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1111%2F1467-9248.12053|journal=Political Studies|language=en|volume=63|issue=1|pages=80–100|doi=10.1111/1467-9248.12053|issn=0032-3217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland also has the highest ''Potential Net Migration Index'' of any European country by a large margin, at +150% (followed by [[immigration to Sweden|Sweden]] at +78%)
according to a 2010 Gallup study; this means that out of an estimated 700 millon potential migrants worldwide, about 12 million (150% of Swiss resident population) would name Switzerland as their most desired country of residence.&lt;ref&gt;Neli Esipova, Julie Ray, and Rajesh Srinivasan, ''The World’s Potential Migrants'', Gallup, 2010.{{cite web|url=http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/the-worlds-potential-migrants |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910194152/http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/the-worlds-potential-migrants |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }} Based on a poll of close to 350,000 adults in 148 countries answering the question ''Ideally, if you had the opportunity, would you like to move permanently to another country, or would you prefer to continue living in this country?'', if answered in the affirmative followed by ''To which country would you like to move?''  [Open-ended, one response allowed.]

==History==
[[File:Switzerland, permanent foreign residents as % of total population, 1900-2011.png|thumb|Permanent foreign residents as a percentage of the total population, 1900-2011]]
Industrialization and  [[Swiss Banks|banking]] made Switzerland prosperous by the late 19th century and began to attract significant numbers of [[migrant worker]]s.
Free movement of population was established with neighbouring countries in the late 19th century, and as a consequence, there was an increase from 211,000 resident foreigners in 1880 (7.5% of total population) to 552,000 in 1910 (14.7% of total population).

There was net emigration of foreign residents during the [[Switzerland during the World Wars|World Wars era]]. The fraction of foreign residents fell to 10.4% by 1920, and to 5.1% by 1941. Immigration has picked up again after 1945. Beginning in the mid-1950s, immigration increased steeply, and the historical record of close to 15% foreigners prior to World War I was surpassed at some time during the 1960s.

Until the 1960s, the immigration policy remained largely liberal.  In the 1960s, rapid economic growth in Switzerland led to a large increase in the number of foreign residents. Because of this, the [[Federal Council of Switzerland|Federal Council]] enacted a regulation to limit the number of foreigners in each company.&lt;ref name=msgrel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Afonso|first=Alexandre|date=2004|title=Immigration and Its Impacts in Switzerland|url=http://mq.dukejournals.org/content/15/4/147.citation|journal=Mediterranean Quarterly|doi=10.1215/10474552-15-4-147|pmid=|access-date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, this per-company limit was replaced with a general limit for all recently arrived foreigners who were gainfully employed. In the 1970s, the number of foreigners decreased because of a period of recession. The proportion of foreigners to the total population, after growing steadily until 1974 and peaking at 16.8%, went down to 14.1% in 1979.&lt;ref name=msgrel/&gt;

The favorable economic climate of the 1980s brought a renewed demand for labour, which was filled by foreign workers. This led to an increase in the proportion of foreign permanent residents, from 14.8% in 1980 to 18.1% in 1990.&lt;ref name=msgrel/&gt; Between 1991 and 1998, the Federal Council replaced the previous system of admission with a binary system that distinguished between member states of the [[European Union|EU]]/[[EFTA]] and all other countries, which largely remains in force. With this reform, the possibility of recruiting unskilled workers from non-EU/EFTA countries was abolished, with the exception of family reunification and asylum applications.&lt;ref name=msgrel/&gt;

In 1996, the Federal Council established a commission on immigration (the Hug Commission) to establish a new policy on immigration. Based on its work, a second commission was established to draft a new law on immigration. In the 1990s, the proportion of foreigners continued to rise, from 18.1% to 20.9%.&lt;ref name=msgrel/&gt;

An agreement on the free movement of people, part of a series of bilateral agreements with the European Union, was signed on 21 June 1999 and approved on 21 May 2000 with 67.2% of the vote. The agreement on free movement entered into force on 1 June 2002. On 24 September 2006, the new law on foreigners was approved with 68% of votes in favor. The law came into force on 1 January 2008.&lt;ref name=msgrel/&gt; Switzerland is also a party to the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] and [[Dublin Regulation|Dublin]] agreements. They were signed on 26 October 2004 and the collaboration actually began on 12 December 2008.&lt;ref name=msgrel/&gt;

In 2000, foreign permanent residents accounted for 20.9% of the population. In 2011, the percentage rose to 22.8%. In 2011, 22,551 people filed an application for asylum in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=msgrel/&gt; There was a net immigration of foreigners taking permanent residence in Switzerland of 83,200 in 2007, and of 103,400 in 2008. Net immigration fell moderately in 2009, to 79,000, and continued to fall to 51,190 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/07/blank/data/01.Document.88343.xls Wanderung der ständigen ausländischen Wohnbevölkerung], [http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/06/blank/key/08.html Federal Statistical Office]&lt;/ref&gt;

The admission of people from non-EU/EFTA countries is regulated by the Foreign Nationals Act, and is limited to skilled workers who are urgently required and are likely to integrate successfully in the long term. There are quotas established yearly: in 2012 it was 3,500 residency permits and 5,000 short-term permits.&lt;ref name=msgrelp292&gt;{{cite web|title=Message relatif à l’initiative populaire "Contre l’immigration de masse"|url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/federal-gazette/2013/279.pdf|publisher=Chancellerie fédérale|accessdate=11 August 2013|pages=292–293|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, 1039 deportations were issued by courts. A third (348) of the deportees were of Balkan origins, 157 were North African and 93 were from West Africa. Of the remainder, 279 were EU citizens of which 138 were Romanians, 33 were French, 32 were Italian and a dozen Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.20min.ch/ro/news/suisse/story/Plus-de-mille-criminels-etrangers-renvoyes-27773071|title=Mille criminels étrangers renvoyés l'an dernier|last=www.20min.ch|first=www.20minutes.ch, 20 Minutes, 20 Min,|work=20 Minutes|access-date=2018-10-14|language=fr-CH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Referendums on immigration==
{{see also|Voting in Switzerland}}
There have been a number of ballot proposals to restrict immigration to Switzerland, starting already in the 20th century. Many of these were either rejected by popular vote, or not implemented (e.g. the people's initiative "against foreign infiltration and overpopulation of Switzerland" or the people's initiative "for a regulation of immigration").&lt;ref name=msgrelp294&gt;{{cite web |title=Message relatif à l’initiative populaire "Contre l’immigration de masse" |url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/federal-gazette/2013/279.pdf |publisher=Chancellerie fédérale suisse |location=Berne, Switzerland |pages=294–295 |language=French |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1993 and 2010, 18 referendums were held on topics related to the foreign population. These were approved in eleven cases, and rejected in seven.&lt;ref name=dhsxeno&gt;{{cite web |title=Xénophobie |url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F16529.php |work=Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse DHS |publisher=DHS - HLS - DSS |location=Berne, Switzerland |language=French, German, Italian |accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included:
* 1 December 1996, the [[Swiss referendums, 1996|People's initiative "against illegal immigration"]] was rejected by 53.7% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Votation no 432 |url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/f//pore/va/19961201/det432.html |publisher=Chancellerie fédérale  suisse |location=Berne, Switzerland |language=French, German, Italian |accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 24 November 2002, the [[Swiss referendums, 2002|People's initiative on asylum]] was rejected by 50.1% of voters. The proposal asked the federal government to apply new elements of procedural law, criminal and welfare sector asylum, to make the Switzerland less attractive as a country of asylum, while respecting the obligations of international law.&lt;ref name=msgrelp294/&gt;
* 13 September 2004, the initiative "limitation of immigration from non-EU countries" failed because of insufficient number of signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Initiative populaire fédérale 'Limitation de l'immigration en provenance d'États non membres de l'UE' |url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/f//pore/vi/vis315.html |publisher=Chancellerie fédérale  suisse |location=Berne, Switzerland |language=French, German, Italian |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative provided that the number of immigrants and asylum seekers in a year could not exceed the number of people emigrated the previous year.&lt;ref name=msgrelp294/&gt;
* 1 June 2008, the [[Swiss referendums, 2008#June referendums|people's initiative for democratic naturalisation]] was rejected with 63.8% of the vote. It intended to authorize municipalities to establish procedures to grant municipal citizenship.&lt;ref name=msgrelp294/&gt;
* 28 November 2010, the people's initiative [[Swiss referendums, 2010#November|for the deportation of criminal foreigners]] was accepted with 52.3% of the vote. Following the approval of the proposal, foreigners convicted of certain offenses or who were paid illegally social insurance benefits or social assistance lose the right of residence and are expelled from Switzerland.&lt;ref name=msgrelp294/&gt;
* 9 February 2014, the [[federal popular initiative "against mass immigration"]] was accepted by 50.3% of voters. The referendum aims to reduce immigration through quotas and limits the [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|freedom of movement]] between [[Switzerland and the European Union]].
*  30 November 2014, ''[[Ecopop]]'' popular initiative "stop overpopulation", aiming at a cap on population growth of 0.2% p.a. This was defeated by 74% of votes.

==Demographics==
In 2009, a total number of 160,600 people immigrated to Switzerland, while a total number of 86,000 people left the country, leaving a net immigration of 74,600 people.

[[Population growth]] in Switzerland is mostly due to immigration: in 2009, there have been 78,286 live births recorded (74% Swiss, 26% foreign nationalities), contrasting with 62,476 deaths (92% Swiss, 8% foreigners).
Thus, of the population growth rate of 1.1% during 2009, about 0.2% are due to births, and 0.9% due to immigration.

As of 2009, a total number of 1,714,000 foreign nationals were registered as residing in Switzerland, accounting for 22.0% of total population. Of these, 1,680,000 had permanent residence (excluding exchange students, seasonal workers and asylum seekers). Of these, 354,000 were born in Switzerland. Another 522,000 had resided in Switzerland for more than 15 years.
[[Swiss nationality law]] permits naturalization after a period of twelve years. 43,440 people were naturalized as Swiss citizens in 2009.

===Permanent residents by nationality===
In 2013 there were a total of 1,937,447 permanent residents (23.8% of the total population of 8.14 million) in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/01/key.html Bevölkerung - Die wichtigsten Zahlen] Swiss Federal Statistical Office, accessed 6 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Auslander&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/07/blank/key/01/01.html Ständige ausländische Wohnbevölkerung nach Staatsangehörigkeit, am Ende des Jahres] Swiss Federal Statistical Office, accessed 6 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority (1.65 million, 85% of the total immigrants and 20.2% of the total population) came from Europe.  The following chart shows permanent resident numbers from selected regions and countries every 5 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1995">'''Intrusiveness''' can refer to a behavior, act, state or disposition towards being intrusive, interrupting and disturbing to others. Intrusiveness is typically unwelcome and recipients of intrusive behavior may feel like the intruder is coming without welcome or invitation, invading their personal space, or interfering in their private life. People who are [[introvert]]ed may be more likely to experience the feeling of being intruded upon.&lt;ref&gt;Higher Reality Therapy: Nine Pathways to Inner Peace - Page 160, Anthony Falikowski - 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Level Psychology Through Diagrams - Page 274, Grahame Hill - 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many [[interjection]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[idiom]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and phrases which are related to intrusiveness, such as ''mind your own business'' or ''being nosey''. Nouns for people who are associated with intrusive behavior include snooper, interferer, interrupter, intruder, interposer, invader, intervener, intervenist, interventionist, pryer, stickybeak, gatecrasher, interloper, peeping tom, persona non grata, encroacher, backseat driver, kibitzer, meddler, nosy parker, marplot, gossipmonger and [[yenta]].

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}

'''Jewish views on evolution''' includes a continuum of views about the [[theory of evolution]], [[experimental evolution]], the [[origin of life]], [[age of the universe]], [[evolutionary creationism]], and  [[theistic evolution]]. Today, many Jews accept the theory of evolution and do not see it as incompatible with traditional Judaism, reflecting the emphasis of prominent rabbis such as the [[Vilna Gaon]]&lt;ref&gt;The Vilna Gaon, [[Elijah ben Shlomo Zalman Kremer]], studied secular sciences and adwised his friends and students to do as well, maintaining that Judaism could only gain by studying them. {{cite web|title=ELIJAH BEN SOLOMON (also called Elijah Wilna, Elijah Gaon, and Der Wilner Gaon)|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5673-elijah-ben-solomon|website=jewishencyclopedia.com|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Vilna Gaon contributed to secular sciences: ''Ayil Meshullash'', a treatise on trigonometry, geometry, and some principles of astronomy and algebra containing 400 rules, Wilna, 1834; ''Treatise on astronomy''; ''Treatises on the teḳufot and moladot"; ''Diḳduḳ Eliyahu'', a short Hebrew grammar, Wilna 1833; ''Ma'aseh Toreh'', a collection of notes on different subjects; ibd.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maimonides]]&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Moses ben Maimon (RaMBaM) frequently cited principles of sciences, such as mathematics and physics, astronomy and medicine, and contributed to them. Maimonides held that there is no contradiction between the revealed truths of God and the truths discovered and explored by the human [[mind]], a gift from God. {{cite web|title=MOSES BEN MAIMON (RaMBaM; usually called MAIMONIDES)|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11124-moses-ben-maimon|website=jewishencyclopedia.com|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the ethical rather than factual significance of scripture.

==Classical rabbinic teachings==
Many [[rabbi]]s believe that God completed the creation of the world close to 6,000 years ago. This view is based on a chronology developed in a [[midrash]], ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah|Seder Olam]]'', which was based on a literal reading of the [[Book of Genesis]]. It is attributed to the [[Tannaim|Tanna]] [[Yose ben Halafta]], and covers history from the creation of the universe to the construction of the Second [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Since there is no explicit discussion in the classical era, it is commonly presumed that they took Genesis 1 literally, making the beginning of the world six days earlier, but this is presumption in the absence of data.

Some modern rabbis&lt;ref&gt;See for example Slifkin, Nathan, ''The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science,Cosmology, and Evolution,'' ZooTorah/Lambda Press, Brooklyn, 2010, section two, "Cosmology," pp. 157-190 for a discussion of these beliefs&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the world is older. They believe such a view is needed to accept scientific theories, such as the [[theory of evolution]]. Rabbis who have this view base their conclusions on verses in the [[Talmud]] or in the [[midrash]]. For example:

* The [[Midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;רבה בראשית ט אות ב&lt;/ref&gt; says: God created many worlds but was not satisfied, and left the world he was satisfied with.
* Rabbi Moshe Ben Nachman (1194–1270) writes:&lt;ref&gt;בראשית א א&lt;/ref&gt; In the first day God created the energy (כח) "matter" (חומר) of all things, and then he was finished with the main creation. After that God created all other things from that energy.
* Some midrashim state that the "first week" of Creation lasted for extremely long periods of time. See Anafim on [[Bahya ben Asher|Rabbenu Bachya's]] Sefer Ikkarim 2:18; Midrash Bereshit Rabbah 9.

==Medieval rabbinic teachings==
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sculpture of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
In his commentary on the Torah, Rabbi [[Bahya ben Asher]] (11th century, Spain) concludes that there were many time systems occurring in the universe long before the spans of history that man is familiar with. Based on the Kabbalah he calculates that the Earth is billions of years old.&lt;ref&gt;Dov Ginzburg, ''The Age of the Earth from Judaic Traditional Literature'', Earth Sciences History, Vol. 3, No. 2 (1984), pp. 169-173. [http://earthscienceshistory.org/doi/abs/10.17704/eshi.3.2.ml66h618g202x677?journalCode=eshi Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some medieval philosophical rationalists, such as [[Maimonides]] and [[Gersonides]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Natan Slifkin|Slifkin, Rabbi Natan]]. ''The Challenge of Creation'', (New York: Yashar Books 2006) page 200.&lt;/ref&gt; held that not every statement in Genesis is meant literally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guide to the Perplexed]], 2:17&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, one was obligated to understand Torah in a way that was compatible with the findings of [[science]]. Indeed, [[Maimonides]], one of the great Rabbis of the [[Middle Ages]], wrote that if science and Torah were misaligned, it was either because science was not understood or the Torah was misinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', 2:25&lt;/ref&gt; Maimonides argued that if science proved a point that did not contradict any fundamentals of faith, then the finding should be accepted and scripture should be interpreted accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides. ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Book II, chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in discussing [[Plato]]'s view that the universe has existed literally forever, he argued that there was no convincing rational proof one way or the other, so that he (Maimonides) was free to accept, and therefore did accept, the literal Biblical view that the universe came into being at a definite time; but that had Plato's Theory been convincing enough with sufficient scientific proof he would have been able to reinterpret Genesis accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides. ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Book 2, Chapter 25. See [http://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_2.25.2?lang=bi http://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed] of M. Friedländer's translation, 1919 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Maimonides stated that "the account given in scripture is not, as is generally believed, intended to be in all its parts literal." Later in the same paragraph, he specifically states that this applies to the text from the beginning to the account of the sixth day of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides. ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Book II, chapter 29.  See [https://books.google.com/books?id=a2dRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA211 page 211] of M. Friedländer's translation, 1919 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nahmanides]], often critical of the rationalist views of Maimonides, pointed out (in his commentary to Genesis) several non-sequiturs stemming from a literal translation of the Bible's account of Creation, and stated that the account actually symbolically refers to spiritual concepts. He quoted the [[Mishnah]] in Tractate [[Hagigah]] which states that the actual meaning of the Creation account, mystical in nature, was traditionally transmitted from teachers to advanced scholars in a private setting. Many classic [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] sources mention ''Shmitot'' - cosmic cycles of creation, similar to the Indian concept of [[yugas]]. [[Nahmanides|Nahmanides']] disciple, [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre|Rabbi Isaac of Akko]], a prominent Kabbalist of 13th-century, held that the Universe is about 15 billion years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Immortality, resurrection, and the age of the universe: a kabbalistic view |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cajobAjRh3IC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=Sefer+Ha+Temunah+forms+of+Hebrew+letters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=63uku8qBxt&amp;sig=vrE3UQjPFp9dXtFsi_AdoVRKSOA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y8s5TJa6AYn4sAP52NxR&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sefer%20Ha%20Temunah%20forms%20of%20Hebrew%20letters&amp;f=false|publisher= Ktav Publishing House |date=January 1993 |first1= Aryeh |last1= Kaplan |authorlink1= Aryeh Kaplan |page= 9 |ISBN= 978-0-88125-345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tradition of ''Shmitot'', Genesis talks openly only about the current epoch, while the information about the previous cosmic cycles is hidden in the esoteric reading of the text.

A literal interpretation of the biblical Creation story among classic rabbinic commentators is uncommon. Thus Bible commentator Abraham Ibn Ezra (11th Century) wrote,

''If there appears something in the Torah which contradicts reason…then here one should seek for the solution in a figurative interpretation…the narrative of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for instance, can only be understood in a figurative sense.''

One of several notable exceptions may be the [[Tosafists|Tosafist]] commentary on [[Tractate Rosh Hashanah]], where there seems to be an allusion to the age of creation according to a literal reading of Genesis. The non-literal approach is accepted by many as a possible approach within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and some segments of [[Haredi Judaism]].

[[Rashi]], while his commentary on the verses describing the days of creation teaches them as literal days, brackets his discussion of Genesis ch. 1 with comments stating that the entire world was created at once, with no duration of existence before Adam being specified.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Genesis 1:1, sv "בראשית ברא"; and 2:2 sv "תולדות השמים"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, Rabbi [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre]] made the insight that, since Sabbatical cycles existed before man was created, time before Adam and Eve must be measured in divine years, not human years. Psalm 90:4 says, "For a thousand years in thy sight are but like yesterday when it is past, and like a watch in the night." Rabbi Isaac of Akko - who held like Livnat Ha-Sapir, that we are in the seventh Sabbatical cycle - therefore took the above figure of 42,000 years and multiplied it by 365,250 (he was using a 365.25-day year) to get 15,340,500,000 years for the age of the universe when Adam was created.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cajobAjRh3IC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Rabbi+Isaac+of+Akko&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=65tcoamBDm&amp;sig=JwpywnRpPKUglv5pBrU189z8UJk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8pLHqwYPMAhUEHKYKHaLzBpgQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Rabbi%20Isaac%20of%20Akko&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yashanet.com/library/missing_link.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish views in reaction to Darwin==
With the advent of [[Charles Darwin]]'s evolutionary theory, the Jewish community found itself engaged in a discussion of [[Jewish principles of faith]] and modern scientific findings.

===Post-1800 Kabbalistic views of compatibility===
Rabbi [[Elijah Benamozegh]], an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[kabbalah|Kabbalist]], wrote that were evolution to become a mainstay of scientific theory, it would not contradict the Torah as long as one understood it as having been guided by God.&lt;ref&gt;''Em LeMikra'' ([[Livorno]] 1863) commenting on [[Deuteronomy]] 22:10, page 87a-88b&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Israel Lipschitz]] of Danzig (19th century) gave a famous lecture on Torah and [[paleontology]], which is printed in the ''Yachin u-Boaz'' edition of the [[Mishnah]], after Massechet Sanhedrin. He writes that Kabbalistic texts teach that the world has gone through many cycles of history, each lasting for many tens of thousands of years. He links these teachings to findings about [[geology]] from European, American and Asian geologists, and from findings from paleontologists.  He discusses the wooly [[mammoth]] discovered in 1807 Siberia, Russia, and the remains of several then-famous [[dinosaur]] skeletons recently unearthed.  Finding no contradiction between this and Jewish teachings, he states "From all this, we can see that all the Kabbalists have told us for so many centuries about the fourfold destruction and renewal of the Earth has found its clearest possible confirmation in our time."

When [[scientists]] first developed the theory of evolution, this idea was seized upon by Rabbis such as [[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin]], known as the Netziv, who saw Kabbalah as a way to resolve the differences between traditional readings of the Bible and modern day scientific findings.  He proposed that the ancient fossils of dinosaurs were the remains of beings that perished in the previous "worlds" described in [[midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;מדרש רבה בראשית פרשה ט אות י&lt;/ref&gt; and in some Kabbalistic texts. This was the view held by Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]] (1934–1983).

===Late 19th century Orthodox view of evolution===

[[File:Samson Raphael Hirsch (FL12173324).crop.jpg|thumb| Samson Raphael Hirsch]]
In the late 1880s, Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], an influential leader in the early opposition to non-Orthodox forms of Judaism, wrote that while he did not endorse the idea of [[common descent]] (that all life developed from one common [[organism]]), even if science ever did prove the factuality of Evolution, it would not pose a threat to Orthodox Judaism's beliefs. He posited that belief in [[Evolution]] could instead cause one to be more reverent of God by understanding His wonders (a master plan for the [[universe]]).
:This will never change, not even if the latest scientific notion that the genesis of all the multitudes of organic forms on earth can be traced back to one single, most primitive, primeval form of life should ever appear to be anything more than what it is today, a vague hypothesis still unsupported by fact. Even if this notion were ever to gain complete acceptance by the scientific world, Jewish thought, unlike the reasoning of the high priest of that notion, would nonetheless never summon us to revere a still extant representative of this primal form as the supposed ancestor of us all. Rather, Judaism in that case would call upon its adherents to give even greater reverence than ever before to the one, sole God Who, in His boundless creative wisdom and eternal omnipotence, needed to bring into existence no more than one single, amorphous nucleus and one single law of "adaptation and heredity" in order to bring forth, from what seemed chaos but was in fact a very definite order, the infinite variety of species we know today, each with its unique characteristics that sets it apart from all other creatures. (Collected Writings, vol. 7 pp. 263-264)

By the early to mid-1900s, the majority of [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]] came to accept the existence of evolution as a scientific fact. They interpreted Genesis and related Jewish teachings in light of this fact.

===Modern-day Orthodox Jewish views===
The [[Rabbinical Council of America]] (RCA) has "maintained that evolutionary theory, properly understood, is not incompatible with belief in a Divine Creator, nor with the first 2 chapters of Genesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Creation, Evolution, and Intelligent Design |publisher=Rabbinical Council of America |year=2005 |url=http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=100635}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent Orthodox rabbis who have affirmed that the world is older, and that life has evolved over time include Israel Lipschitz, [[Sholom Mordechai Schwadron]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} (the MaHaRSHaM) (1835–1911), [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes]] (1805–1855) and [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] (1865–1935). These rabbis proposed their own versions of [[theistic evolution]], in which the world is older, and that life does evolve over time in accord with natural law, painting natural law as the process by which God drives the world.

There is, in parallel, a discussion on this subject by scientists in the Orthodox Jewish community. One of the most prominent is [[Gerald Schroeder]], an [[MIT]] trained [[physicist]]. He has written a number of articles and popular books attempting to reconcile Jewish theology with modern scientific findings that the world is billions of years old and that life has evolved over time. His work has received approbations from a number of Orthodox rabbinic authorities. Other physicists writing on this topic include [[Alvin Radkowsky]], [[Nathan Aviezer]], [[Herman Branover]], [[Cyril Domb]], [[Aryeh Kaplan]] and [[Yehuda (Leo) Levi]].

Various popular works, citing an array of classical, Orthodox views, attempt to reconcile traditional Jewish texts with modern scientific findings concerning evolution, the age of the earth and the age of the Universe; these include:
*[[Nathan Aviezer]]: ''In the Beginning, Biblical Creation and Science''; ''Fossils and Faith: Understanding Torah and Science''
*[[Aryeh Carmell]] and [[Cyril Domb]], ed.: ''Challenge: Torah Views on Science and Its Problems''
*[[Daniel E. Friedmann]]: ''The Genesis One Code: Demonstrates a clear alignment between the times of key events described in the Genesis with those derived from scientific observation.'' and ''The Broken Gift: Harmonizing the Biblical and scientific accounts of human origins''
*[[Aryeh Kaplan]]: ''Immortality, Resurrection and the Age of the Universe: A Kabbalistic View''
*[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Yehuda Levi]]: ''Torah and Science - Their Interplay in the World Scheme''
*[[Jonathan Sacks]]: ''The Great Partnership: God, Science and the Search For Meaning''
*[[Gerald Schroeder]]: ''Genesis and the Big Bang: The Discovery of Harmony Between Modern Science and the Bible''; ''The Science of God''
*[[Natan Slifkin]]: ''[[The Challenge of Creation]]''

===Modern-day Conservative Jewish views===

[[Conservative Judaism]] embraces science as a way to learn about the world,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and, like Modern Orthodox and Reform Judaism, has not found the theory of evolution a challenge to traditional Jewish theology. The Conservative Jewish movement has not yet developed one official response to the subject, but a broad array of views has converged. Conservative Jews teach that God created the universe and is responsible for the creation of life within it, but proclaims no mandatory teachings about how this occurs.

Many Conservative Rabbis embrace the term [[theistic evolution]], and reject the term [[intelligent design]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Conservative rabbis who use the term ''intelligent design'' in their sermons often distinguish their views from the Christian use of the term. Like most in the scientific community, they understand "intelligent design" to be a technique by Christians to insert religion into public schools, as admitted in the [[Intelligent design movement]]'s "[[wedge strategy]]".

The Central Conference of American Rabbis is opposed to the teaching of creationism in public schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Central Conference of American Rabbis |title=Religion and the Public Schools |year=1987 |url=http://www.ccarnet.org/rabbis-speak/resolutions/all/religion-and-the-public-schools-1987/}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the Rabbinical Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Resolution on Intelligent Design and the Freedom of Scientific Inquiry|year= 2006|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/resolution-intelligent-design-and-freedom-scientific-inquiry?tp=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative Judaism strongly supports the use of science as the proper way to learn about the physical world in which we live, and thus encourages its adherents to find a way to understand evolution in a way that does not contradict the findings of scientific research. The tension between accepting God's role in the world and the findings of science, however, is not resolved, and a wide array of views exists. Some mainstream examples of Conservative Jewish thought are as follows:

Professor [[Ismar Schorsch]], former chancellor of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], writes that:
:The Torah's story of creation is not intended as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in the very nature of things. And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.

Rabbi [[David J. Fine]], who has authorized official [[responsa]] for the Conservative movement's [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], expresses a common Conservative Jewish view on the subject:

:Conservative Judaism has always been premised on the total embrace of critical inquiry and science. More than being compatible with Conservative Judaism, I would say that it is a mitzvah to learn about the world and the way it works to the best of our abilities, since that is to marvel with awe at God's handiwork. To not do so is sinful.
:
:But here's where the real question lies. Did God create the world, or not? Is it God's handiwork? Many of the people who accept evolution, even many scientists, believe in what is called "theistic evolution," that is, that behind the billions of years of cosmic and biological evolution, there is room for belief in a creator, God, who set everything into motion, and who stands outside the universe as the cause and reason for life. The difference between that and "intelligent design" is subtle yet significant. Believing scientists claim that belief in God is not incompatible with studying evolution since science looks only for the natural explanations for phenomena. The proponents of intelligent design, on the other hand, deny the ability to explain life on earth through solely natural explanations. That difference, while subtle, is determinative.
:David J. Fine, ''Intelligent Design''

Rabbi Michael Schwab writes:
:...the Jewish view on the first set of questions is much closer to the picture painted by adherents to intelligent design than to those who are strict Darwinians. Judaism, as a religion, and certainly Conservative Judaism, sees creation as a purposeful process directed by God, however each individual defines the Divine. This is clearly in consonance with the theory of Intelligent Design. What Darwin sees as random, we see as the miraculous and natural unfolding of God’s subtle and beautiful plan.
:...However, as unlikely as it may seem, this does not mean for one moment that Judaism’s view rejects wholesale the veracity of Darwin’s theory. In fact, I believe that it is easy to incorporate Darwin and Intelligent design into a meaningful conception of how we humans came into being...
:We have frameworks built into our system to integrate the findings of science into our religious and theological beliefs. That is because we believe that the natural world, and the way it works, was created by God and therefore its workings must be consistent with our religious beliefs.
:...One of the most well known ways our tradition has been able to hold onto both the scientific theory of evolution as well as the concept of a purposeful creation was by reading the creation story in Genesis in a more allegorical sense. One famous medieval commentary proclaims that the days of creation, as outlined in the book of Bereshit, could be seen as representative of the stages of creation and not literal 24 hour periods. Thus each Biblical day could have accounted for thousands or even millions of years. In that way the progression according to both evolution and the Torah remains essentially the same: first the elements were created, then the waters, the plants, the animals, and finally us. Therefore, Genesis and Darwin can both be right in a factual analysis even while we acknowledge that our attitudes towards these shared facts are shaped much more strongly by the Torah – we agree how the process unfolded but disagree that it was random.
:Parshat Noah -- November 4, 2005, ''How Did We Get Here?'' Michael Schwab

The claim that evolution is [[teleological|purposeful]] is in conflict with modern-day evolutionary theory.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  The precise way in which God inserts design is not specified by Schwab or other rabbis.

Rabbi [[Lawrence Troster]] is a critic of positions such as this. He holds that much of Judaism (and other religions) have not successfully created a theology which allows for the role of God in the world and yet is also fully compatible with modern-day evolutionary theory. Troster maintains that the solution to resolving the tension between classical theology and modern science can be found in [[process theology]], such as in the writings of [[Hans Jonas]], whose view of an evolving God within process philosophy contains no inherent contradictions between theism and scientific naturalism.
:Lecture ''God after Darwin: Evolution and the Order of Creation'' October 21, 2004, Lishmah, New York City, Larry Troster
In a paper on Judaism and [[environmentalism]], Troster writes:
:Jonas is the only Jewish philosopher who has fully integrated philosophy, science, theology and environmental ethics. He maintained that humans have a special place in Creation, manifest in the concept that humans are created in the image of God. His philosophy is very similar to that of Alfred North Whitehead, who believed that God is not static but dynamic, in a continual process of becoming as the universe evolves.

==Jewish opposition to Darwinian theory==

Whilst the Reform, Conservative and Modern Orthodox movements have stated that they feel there is not a conflict between evolutionary theory and the teachings of Judaism, some [[Haredi]] rabbis have remained staunchly opposed to certain teachings in [[evolution]]ary theory. In contrast with the literalist biblical interpretation of some Christian [[creationism|creationists]], they express an openness to multiple interpretations of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], through Jewish [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]] and [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]]. They have also expressed an openness to evolutionary theory in biology, except where they perceive that it is in conflict with the [[Torah]]'s account of creation.

Rabbi [[Avigdor Miller]], a highly revered American Haredi rabbi of the [[Litvish|Lithuanian Yeshivah Tradition]], who was also highly respected in Hasidic communities such as Satmar, was strongly opposed to the theory of evolution, and wrote strong polemics against evolution in several of his books, as well as speaking about this subject often in his popular lectures, taking a Creationist position. Several selections from his books on this subject were collected in a pamphlet he published in 1995 called "The Universe Testifies".

Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the Rebbe of the worldwide movement of Lubavitcher or [[Chabad]] [[Hasidism]], was avidly opposed to evolution opposed to evolution, and his following remains committed to that position.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112083/jewish/Theories-of-Evolution.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Avi Shafran]], a spokesman for [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel]], writes a weekly column that is  widely syndicated in the Jewish press. As an opponent of Darwinian evolutionary theory, Shafran is careful to distinguish the Jewish perspective from that of Christian fundamentalism. He writes, "An unfortunate side-effect of our affirmation of purpose in creation at a time of controversy is the assumption made by some that we believing Jews share some other groups’ broader skepticism of science. But while Torah-faithful Jews reject the blind worship of science, we do not regard science as an enemy." Quite the contrary, Shafran remarks, Judaism seeks to learn as much as possible from God's creation.

Shafran also rejects the literalism of Christian fundamentalism. He writes, "Nor is 'Biblical literalism' a Jewish approach. Many are the ''p’sukim'' (verses) that do not mean what a simple reading would yield." To Shafran, the Jewish oral tradition is the key to the true meaning of the Torah's words. "There are multiple levels of deeper meanings inaccessible to most of us. The words of ''Breishis'' (Genesis, [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) and the [[Midrash]]im thereon hide infinitely more than they reveal. It is clear that the Torah describes the creation of the universe as the willful act of ''HaKodosh Boruch Hu'' (the Holy One), and describes creation as having unfolded in stages. But details are hardly provided."&lt;ref name=Menken&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Cross-Currents |date=December 22, 2005 |title=Rabbi Avi Shafran on Intelligent Design |last=Menken |first=Yaakov |url=http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/22/rabbi-avi-shafran-on-intelligent-design/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Some contemporary Orthodox Jews writers are concerned that if evolution is accepted as true, then it could lead to the Torah being deemed not only irrelevant but also false. Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb has argued that for Jews accepting evolution is equivalent to accepting atheism. The Israeli microbiologist Morris Goldman has written that Darwinism is a problem for Judaism, since Darwinism makes god irrelevant. Other issues are that evolution can provide a non religious basis for the development of morality, and it removes the idea that humans are qualitatively different from other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Tradition and the Challenge of Darwinism, G. N. Cantor, Marc Swetlitz, University of Chicago Press, 15 Nov 2006, pg 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slifkin affair===

{{Main|Natan Slifkin}}
[[File:Slifkin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Natan Slifkin|Rabbi Natan Slifkin]]]]
In 2004-2005, three popular books by Rabbi [[Natan Slifkin]] (sometimes pronounced ''Nosson'' Slifkin) were banned by a group of [[Haredi]] rabbinic authorities on the grounds that they were heretical. Known to his admirers as the "Zoo Rabbi," Nosson Slifkin was the author of ''The Torah Universe'', a series of books on science and religion that were widely read in Orthodox communities until they were suddenly banned. "The books written by Nosson Slifkin present a great [[stumbling block]] to the reader," the ban declared. "They are full of heresy, twist and misrepresent the words of our sages and ridicule the foundations of our ''emunah'' (faith)." The ban, which prohibited Jews from reading, owning, or distributing Slifkin's books, prompted a widespread backlash in the Orthodox Jewish community.

Jennie Rothenberg, reporting on this ban in the secular Jewish journal, ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]'', asserted that the incident represents a major breaking point within ultra-Orthodox society. Rothenberg interviewed several rabbis who wished to remain anonymous. According to one of them, "Over the past 15 years, the rabbis of [[Bnei Brak, Israel|Bnai Brak]] and the more open American ultra-Orthodox rabbis have been split on a number of important policy decisions. The Slifkin ban is a huge break. It’s a kind of power struggle, and those who didn’t sign the ban are outraged right now. I’m talking about rabbis with long white beards who are furious about it." Slifkin’s views, according to this rabbi, are shared by countless figures within the ultra-Orthodox community. "He’s saying out loud what a lot of people have been talking about quietly all along. To those people, he’s a kind of figurehead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Moment Magazine |title=The Heresy of Nosson Slifkin |last=Rothenberg |first=Jennie |date=October 2005 |url=http://momentmag.com/features/oct05/slifkin.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120174348/http://momentmag.com/features/oct05/slifkin.html |archivedate=November 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthodox scientists respond to Darwin==

Several Modern Orthodox Jewish scientists have interpreted creation in light of both modern scientific findings and rabbinical interpretations of Genesis. Each of these scientists have claimed that modern science actually confirms a literal interpretation of [[Torah]]. All of them accept the scientific evidence that the age of the [[Earth]] and the age of the universe are on a scale of billions of years, and all of them acknowledge that the diversity of species on Earth can be explained through an evolutionary framework. However, each of them interprets certain aspects of evolution or the emergence of modern humans as a divine process, rather than a natural one. Thus, each of them accepts an evolutionary paradigm, while rejecting some aspects of Darwinism. [[Shai Cherry]] writes, "While twentieth century Jewish theologians have tended to compartmentalize science and the Torah, our Modern Orthodox physicists synthesized them.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Nathan Aviezer]]''', a physicist who trained at the [[University of Chicago]], allows for divine guidance within an evolutionary paradigm in the transmutation of species over time, including the emergence of modern man from ''[[Homo erectus]]''. As a physicist, he interprets the six days of creation as broadly referring to large periods of time, an interpretation for which he cites rabbinic sources, including [[Maimonides]] and [[Nachmanides]]. For Aviezer, the evolutionary framework applies, except where the Hebrew verb ''bara'' (''create'') is used. To Aviezer, "It is particularly meaningful that Modern Man is intellectually and culturally so vastly superior to his closest relative, the extinct [[Neanderthal Man]], even though both species are very similar." He explains this through a literal interpretation of Genesis 1:27 &amp;mdash; "And God ''created'' Man in His image."&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 169-172.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Gerald Schroeder]]''', an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] trained physicist, believes that modern science contains nothing inimical to a literal reading of Genesis. Indeed, modern science allows one to understand the "true literal meaning of the Creation narrative." To Schroeder, it is Einstein's relativity, the "distortion of time facing backwards in a forward rushing cosmos," that accounts for the compression of time in a 15-billion year-old universe into six days of creation. To Schroeder, the emergence of modern man can be dated to the beginning of writing. Archeologists date the first writing, he notes, "at five or six thousand years ago, the exact period that the Bible tells us the soul of Adam, the ''[[Soul#Judaism|neshama]]'', was created." To Schroeder, who cites the [[Targum]] of [[Onkelos]], Adam was the first man who could write, and the creation of Adam from more primitive man was a divine ensoulment.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 173-177.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Judah Landa]]''', a physicist and teacher at, among other institutions, the [[Yeshiva of Flatbush]], takes a completely different approach. To Landa, [[genetic mutation]] is not a random process, but a divinely guided one that only appears random to humanity. "Evolution was designed and guided, just as the putting together of words and sentences into book forms is accomplished only by design and guidance. A book is designed by its author, evolution was (and continues to be) designed by the laws of nature (which in turn, were designed, we believe, by God).&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Where Landa differs from Darwin is in his rejection of the Darwinian notion that evolution has no purpose. Landa does not claim that there is proof of a final purpose for life; he merely asserts that science cannot rule one out. He writes, "God may very well have designed the laws of the universe and the earliest forms of matter and energy with particular life-forms as end-products in mind. Evolution and natural selection may be the vehicles he chose and designed to achieve His purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Aviezar and Schroeder, Landa reconciles science with the biblical account of Genesis, taken literally, but he does so through literary interpretation.

[[Shai Cherry]], Professor of Jewish Thought at [[Vanderbilt University]], remarks that these Modern Orthodox scientists have rejected the approach taken by Jewish theologians. Theologians have tended to use later writings, such as [[Midrash]] and [[Kabbalah]], to reconcile modern science with Genesis. The Orthodox scientists, by comparison, have largely ignored Jewish theology, in favor of a fundamentalist and literalist interpretation of Genesis. Yet in their writings, each of them seeks to reconcile science with Genesis. Cherry speculates, "They were targeting an American Jewish community that privileges science over Torah as a source of scientific knowledge. If Genesis could be shown to have anticipated Darwin or Einstein, then the Bible would regain an aura of truth that it had been losing since the advent of biblical criticism and modern science."&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cherry, the books of Aviezar, Schroeder, and Landa have each sought to strengthen Orthodox Jewry in a time of mounting secularization. Aviezar and Schroeder sought to prove that Genesis anticipates the findings of modern science, and thus increase its status. By contrast, Landa sought to remove a barrier to Orthodox commitment, by proving to secular Jews that Orthodox Judaism and modern science are compatible. At the same time, he sought to persuade students in his own Orthodox community that the study of science is not incompatible with commitment to Orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nathan Robertson a researcher in Biophysics has also released a book titled "The First Six Days" which claims to reconcile the scientific theory of the beginnings of the universe and life with the biblical account of creation. Rabbinical sources are cited from Nachmanides (Ramban) and Rashi along with kabbalistic interpretations of Genesis. Nathan reconciles Darwinian evolution with the biblical account and states that at deeper levels of understanding of the biblical text and of scientific theory, the two worlds overlap. "As one studies science to deeper levels and also tries to study Bereshis [Genesis] to deeper levels, both principles begin to converge on each other."

==Jewish reactions to intelligent design==
{{Main|Jewish reactions to intelligent design}}

The movement for [[intelligent design]] claims that an intelligent creator is responsible for the [[origin of life]] and of humankind, and rejects evolution. Jewish theologians, organizations, and activists have maintained that intelligent design is not valid science but that it is a religious concept. Although some have expressed support for a theistic interpretation of evolution, they have generally rejected the tenets of the intelligent design movement. To Rabbi [[Brad Hirschfield]], President of the [[National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership]], intelligent design is "their attempt to confirm what they already believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirschfield |first=Brad |title=The Origins of Life: A Jewish Perspective |publisher=National Public Radio |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4761360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish organizations in the [[United States]] have been steadfast in their opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools, charging that to do so would violate the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Juang language''' is a [[language]] spoken primarily by the [[Juang people]] of [[Odisha]] state, eastern [[India]].

==Classification==
The Juang language belongs to the [[Munda languages|Munda language family]], the whole of which is classified as a branch of the greater [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language family]]. Among the Munda languages, Juang is considered to be most closely related to [[Kharia language|Kharia]], although Anderson considers Juang and Kharia to have split off from each other relatively early.&lt;ref name=e18&gt;{{Ethnologue18|jun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juang can be roughly divided into the Hill and Plains varieties, both of which are spoken in [[Odisha]] (Patnaik 2008:508).
*'''Hill Juang''': Gonasika Hills (in [[Keonjhar district]]) and Pallara Hills
*'''Plains Juang''': about 147 villages in southern [[Keonjhar district]] and eastern [[Dhenkanal district]]

==Distribution==
Juang is spoken by about 30,875 people according to the 2001 Indian census. In [[Odisha]] state, it is spoken in southern [[Keonjhar district]], northern [[Angul district]], and eastern [[Dhenkanal district]] (Patnaik 2008:508).

Juang is currently an [[Endangered language]] and is considered to vulnerable, or (not spoken by children outside of home).

Juang currently has roughly under 20,000 speakers remaining

== Grammar ==
In Juang a number of roots are clearly exempt from the [[Transitive verb]]/[[Intransitive verb]] opposition, so that the function of the root can be determined only from its co-occurrence with the particular set of tense markers.

For Example,

pag-  Set I 'to break' -Set II 'to be broken1

rag- Set I 'to tear' - Set II 'to be torn1

guj- Set I 'to wash' - Set II 'to be was

== Writing System ==
The  writing system used by people who speak the Juang language is [[Odia alphabet|Odia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7273">The subject of [[language learning]] is subject to several misconceptions. It is common for people to rely on their own intuitions about language learning, though they would not do so with other technical subjects such as [[physics]] (a phenomenon known as ''[[folk linguistics]]'').{{sfn|Dicker|2003|p=85|ps=: ''People would never pontificate about a physics issue, because they would acknowledge that you need to consult an expert. But they wouldn't hesitate to pontificate about language.''&lt;!--Although quoted in a chapter talking about the American public, this citation is clearly used to specifically talk about people in general and is in addition a citation from a different work (Fox, 1999), so it is specifically applicable to the general public worldwide. In addition, the physics example is not anecdotal but on the contrary a concrete example of another science that is as rigorous as linguistics but whose subject and contents is treated very differently by the general public.--&gt;}} However, these intuitions are often contradicted by scientific research.{{sfn|McLaughlin|1992}}

== Childhood language acquisition ==

=== Children learn their first language effortlessly ===

Learning a first language is not rapid for children. Children spend years learning their [[Mother-tongue|mother tongue]], and the process continues well into their school years. At seven years old, for example, many children have difficulties creating [[Passive voice|passive-voice]] sentences.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=86–87}}

== Second-language acquisition ==

=== Younger learners learn languages more easily than older learners ===

It is often assumed that young children learn languages more easily than adolescents and adults.{{sfn|McLaughlin|1992}}{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}} However, the reverse is true; older learners are faster. The only exception to this rule is in [[pronunciation]]. Young children invariably learn to speak their second language with native-like pronunciation, whereas learners who start learning a language at an older age only rarely reach a native-like level.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}}

=== Intelligent people are better at learning languages ===

[[General intelligence]] is actually quite a poor indicator of language-learning ability. [[Motivation in second-language learning|Motivation]], tolerance for ambiguity, and [[self-esteem]] are all better indicators of language-learning success.{{sfn|Johnson|2008|p=64}}

=== Immersion is the best way to learn a language ===

The ability for learners to develop their language skills depends to a large extent on the type of language input that they receive. For input to be effective for second-language acquisition, it must be comprehensible. Merely being immersed in a second-language environment is no guarantee of receiving comprehensible input. For example, learners living in a country where their second language is spoken may be lucky enough to interact with native speakers who can alter their speech to make it comprehensible; but equally, many learners will not have that same luck, and may not understand the vast majority of the input that they receive.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=92–97}}

In addition, adult learners living in a foreign country may not have very high linguistic demands placed on them, for example if they are a low-level employee at a company. Without the incentive to develop high-level skills in their second language, learners may undergo ''[[language fossilisation]]'', or a plateau in their language level.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=92–97}}

Classroom instruction can be useful in both providing appropriate input for second-language learners, and for helping them overcome problems of fossilisation.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=92–97}}

=== Grammar study is detrimental to second-language acquisition ===

The study of [[grammar]] is helpful for second-language learners, and a lack of grammar knowledge can slow down the language-learning process. On the other hand, relying on grammar instruction as the primary means of learning the language is also detrimental. A balance between these two extremes is necessary for optimal language learning.{{sfn|Johnson|p=67}}

== Bilingual education ==

=== Learning a second language hinders the development of the first language ===

Learners can learn two or more languages without their first language development being adversely affected. There is no such thing as a "fixed amount of space" for languages in the brain. In reality, learners' first languages and their additional languages become part of an integrated system.{{sfn|Matthews|2006|p=16}}

=== Once a child can speak a language, the language-learning process is complete ===

Learning to speak a language [[conversation]]ally is only part of the way towards becoming [[Fluency|fluent]] in it. Just because a child can speak a language does not mean that they are yet capable of [[writing]] and understanding [[academic]] language. This kind of language is particularly important in school in the later grades. One study of 1,200 Canadian schoolchildren indicated that it may take between five and seven years longer to master academic language than to master conversational language.{{sfn|McLaughlin|1992}}

'''{{lang|fr|Monsieur}}''' ({{IPA-fr|mə.sjø}}; [[plural|pl.]] {{lang|fr|Messieurs}}; 1512, from [[Middle French]] ''mon sieur'', literally "my lord"&lt;ref name="MerWeb"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monsieur | title = monsieur | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[honorific]] [[title]] that used to refer to or address the eldest living brother of the king in the [[Ancien Régime in France|French royal court]]. It has now become the customary [[French people|French]] title of respect and term of address for a French-speaking man, corresponding to such English [[title]]s as [[Mr.]] or [[sir]].&lt;ref name="Brit1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/390287/monsieur |title = Monsieur | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Under the [[Ancien Régime]], the court title of Monsieur referred to the next brother in the line of succession of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]].

[[François, Duke of Anjou|Hercule François, Duke of Anjou and Alençon]] (1555&amp;ndash;1584), was the first notable member of the royalty to assume the title without the use of an adjoining proper name.&lt;ref name="Brit1"/&gt; In 1576, Monsieur pressured his brother King [[Henry III of France]] into signing the [[Edict of Beaulieu]] and effectively ending [[French Wars of Religion#1574–80|the Fifth Religious War]] of France. The resulting peace became popularly known as ''the Peace of Monsieur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Cambridge Modern History, Volume 3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=x9VmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA30  | page = 30 | last1 = Acton | first1 =  Lord | last2 =  Ward | first2 =  A.W. | year = 1918 | last3 =  Prothero | first3 =  G.W. | last4 = Leathes | first4 = Stanley | accessdate = August 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title was later assumed by [[Gaston, Duke of Orléans]], brother of [[Louis XIII]], and then [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]], brother of [[Louis XIV]]. From 1643 to 1660, while both princes were alive, Philippe was commonly known as ''le Petit Monsieur'', while Gaston, his uncle, was known as ''le Grand Monsieur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/frroyal.htm#address |title=The French Royal Family: Titles and Customs |publisher=Heraldica.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arnault&gt;{{Cite book | title = Le Destin Tragique D'henriette D'angleterre: 1644&amp;ndash;1670 Biographie et mémoires aprocryphes | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6X-09qkONjcC&amp;pg=PA99 | author = Arnault, Pfersdorff | page = 99 | isbn = 978-2-7483-1996-5 | accessdate = August 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=August 2009}}

For over seventy years, from 1701 to 1774, the title had no living representatives in the French court, as [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Philippe of France]], died in 1701; [[Louis XV]] was the youngest of the sons of [[Louis of France, Duke of Burgundy]] and at the time of his accession to the throne in 1715 had no brothers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The title was restored in 1775 for [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis Stanislas Xavier, Count of Provence]], the oldest surviving brother of the reigning [[Louis XVI]] and the future [[Louis XVIII]]. After his coronation in 1814, the title passed to [[Charles X of France|Charles Philippe, Count of Artois]], his younger brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nndb.com/people/833/000093554/ | title = Charles X, AKA Charles Bourbon | publisher = [[NNDB|Notable Names Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Philippe, who led the [[Ultra-royalist|ultras]] during the [[Bourbon Restoration]] and became King Charles X in 1824,&lt;ref name="Brit2"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Chisholm, Hugh  | title = The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volume 5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KjUEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA921 | page = 921  | year = 1911 | accessdate = August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the last royal sibling to officially hold the title of Monsieur. His successor, [[Louis-Philippe I]], the next and last king to rule France, had lost both his brothers, [[Louis Charles, Count of Beaujolais|Louis Charles]] and [[Antoine Philippe, Duke of Montpensier|Antoine Philippe]], many years before he succeeded to the throne.

A fuller list of those who have been known by this title includes:

*[[Charles IX of France|Charles, Duke of Orléans]] (1559–1560)&lt;ref name="Brit2" /&gt;
*[[Henry III of France|Henri, Duke of Anjou]] (1560–1574)
*[[François, Duke of Anjou]] (1555–1584)
*[[Gaston, Duke of Orléans]] (1611–1643)
*[[Philippe I of Orléans|Philippe, Duke of Orléans]] (1643–1701)
*[[Louis XVIII of France|Louis Stanislas, Count of Provence]] (1774–1793)
*[[Charles X of France|Charles Philippe, Count of Artois]] (1795–1823)

== Modern usage ==
In modern French, ''monsieur'' (plural ''messieurs'') is used as a courtesy title of respect, an equivalent of English "[[Mr|mister]]" or "sir".&lt;ref name="Brit1" /&gt; It can be abbreviated in ''M.'' (plural: ''MM.''), "Mssr." (plural: "Mssrs."),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wordnik.com/words/Mssr&lt;/ref&gt; and rarely ''M&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;'' (plural: ''M&lt;sup&gt;rs&lt;/sup&gt;''), but never ''Mr.'', which is only for ''Mister''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1710">'''Naneelu''' is a form of [[Telugu literature]] which contains 4 lines and a minimum of 20 letters, not exceeding 25. This form was introduced by [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] winner Professor [[N. Gopi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Telangana/2016-02-28/Naneelu-turning-point-in-Telugu-literature/210260&lt;/ref&gt;

Naneelu was introduced in the year 2002 by Dr N Gopi through his book ''Naeelu''.

== Properties ==
Naneelu should have 4 lines and never have less than 20 and never exceed 25 letters. If one were to pause at the end of the second line, the executed meaning is incomplete. At the same time, the first is not clear unless one reads the second part. That means though appearing as identical in structure and as two sentences, the [[poem]] reaches completion only when united in thought.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wOKW5NHcHCQC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Dr.+N.+Gopi&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Dr.%20N.%20Gopi&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
''Nani'' is a word used in Telugu Community to call their children with love. Dr N Gopi wanted to name this form with something very connected to [[Telugu people]]. So, he considered this name.

And Gopi in his book also said "Naneelu belong to you and to me - 'na' and 'nee' mean in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] 'my' and 'your' respectively, and the end 'lu' indicative of the plural number of the poems - in short, they belong to all of us"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museindia.com/viewarticle.asp?myr=2009&amp;issid=28&amp;id=1745&lt;/ref&gt;

*A poem from Gopi's Naneelu
&lt;poem&gt;
''Grieve not
''for the broken earthen pot.
''The earth is preparing
''to shape anew''
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Career ==
While working as an applied physicist for aerospace firm [[TRW Inc.]], in 1997 Courrielche started the now ubiquitous pop-up retail trend - or short-term sales spaces - with an event called the Ritual Expo. Initially a nightclub-meets-shopping experience, the event would eventually focus solely on creating temporary shopping experiences during the day and was initially called the "ultimate hipster mall." The event was known for attracting style brokers and cultural influencers in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, D. James, (April 24, 1997) Los Angeles Times. "Ritual" http://articles.latimes.com/1997-04-24/news/ls-51710_1_fashion-labels&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Rose Apodaca, (August 28, 2000) WWD. "Cool Like That" http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/article-1198580/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baltin, Steve, (October, 2000) Chicago Tribune. "Ritual in the Making, Creative Fields Converge To Form Ultimate Hipster Mall In A Nightclub Atmosphere." http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-10-11/features/0010100545_1_jed-wexler-ritual-events-walk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Booth, (July, 1999) LA Times. "Cutting-Edge Clothes and Music at Ritual Expos." http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/09/news/cl-54193&lt;/ref&gt; According to Courrielche, he started his pop-up retail stores with smaller, hard-to-find clothing manufacturers because large corporate brands did not immediately find value in the new concept. That all changed with the 2000 publication of [[The Tipping Point]] by [[Malcolm Gladwell]]. In his book, Gladwell emphasized the importance of connecting with "influencers" to sell a product or service. Companies began contacting Courrielche to create pop-up stores to reach these influencers, and he eventually sold the Ritual Expo to the creators of [[Lollapalooza]] and began working with [[Levi Strauss]], [[AT&amp;T]], and [[Motorola]] to execute pop-up retail stores all across the US that featured their products alongside smaller fashion brands and artworks by [[Shepard Fairey]] and [[Dave Kinsey]]. Courrielche is now referred to as "the parent of pop up."&lt;ref name="business2community.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Video compilation of some of first pop-up retail stores. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsX0f7526Zc&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Courrielche started a lifestyle marketing &amp; PR firm, Inform Ventures, with his future wife Adryana Courrielche, and in 2003 began work with [[Toyota]] launching its new youth brand [[Scion (automobile)|Scion]] – considered culturally significant for its use of the arts in attracting customers. He handled Scion's public relations and promotions during the launch, created and produced several branded-entertainment films, including a 2004 docudrama featuring [[Questlove]] from [[The Roots]] and a 2007 short-film featuring [[Biz Markie]], and in 2005 helped create and launch [[Scion Audio/Visual]] - one of the first brand-funded record labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=courrielche+scion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=maoh7NESwB&amp;sig=hNZSa9A9n9Jr94QvlI2DvX5O394&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg-oruj8HNAhUH5mMKHVjzAQ04ChDoAQgyMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=toyota's%20scion%20starts%20label&amp;f=false |title=Toyota's Scion Starts Label |publisher=‘’Billboard’’ |date=March 26, 2005 |accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parpis, Eleftheria, (May 17, 2004) Adweek.

Along with his wife and business partner Adryana, Courrielche created, produced, and wrote a semi-scripted 2010 series of global warming debates between global warming proponents and skeptics, and moderated by comedians [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Jamie Kennedy]], [[Tracy Morgan]], and singer [[Mark McGrath]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ted (July 31, 2010) Variety.

In 2012, he created the first luxury automotive publicity campaign featuring a gay married couple, [[Simon Doonan]] and [[Jonathan Adler]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Karl (July 27, 2012) Mediapost.

== Writing ==
In August 2009, Courrielche participated in and secretly recorded a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) conference call in which the NEA's communications director, Yosi Sergant encouraged the participants (members of the media and arts community) to support the [[Obama administration]]'s goals by promoting the ''United We Serve'' campaign and create art specific to areas of health care, education and the environment.&lt;ref name="blogs.abcnews.com"/&gt; The [[White House Office of Public Engagement]] also participated in the call.&lt;ref name="blogs.abcnews.com"/&gt; Courrielche criticized the NEA in a subsequent [[Breitbart News]] piece (which was published in part by the [[Wall Street Journal]]), expressing the view that the NEA was being inappropriately used for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Courrielche, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203706604574378753571636982 The National Endowment for the Art of Persuasion?], '' Wall Street Journal'' (August 25, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven Republican [[U.S. Senators]] criticized the conference call and questioned its legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/09/more-than-one-fifth-of-the-us-senate-all-11-of-them-republicans-is-now-on-record-as-being-alarmed-that-the-nea-has-turned.html |title=10 more GOP senators demand answers from the NEA about teleconference |newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date= September 25, 2009 |accessdate= June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melanie Sloan]] of the ethics group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] said that the NEA's call was "terrible" and "inappropriate" although not a violation of federal law.&lt;ref name="blogs.abcnews.com"/&gt; Following the affair, Sergant resigned his position and the White House issued formal guidance and training for staffers "to make sure such a call never happens again."&lt;ref name="blogs.abcnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Craig &amp; Norman Eisen (September 22, 2009), The White House. "Memorandum For White House Staff and For Agency and Department Heads - Guidelines For Public Outreach Meetings" https://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/WH_COUNSEL_MEMO_GUIDELINES_FOR_PUBLIC_OUTREACH_MEETINGS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeleny, Jeff (September 22, 2009) New York Times. "Agencies Instructed to Separate Politics From Grant Awards." https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/us/politics/23grants.html?_r=1&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 op-ed in the 'Wall Street Journal', Courrielche advocated for the elimination of the NEA, claiming that it had become politically tainted, failed to meet its charter, had allowed the degradation of arts education in public schools, and was unable to meet the arts modern challenges. He suggested replacing the agency with an arts counsel that would continue necessary programs, while advising the President on legislation that he says could address what he perceives as systemic problems prohibiting it from flourishing.&lt;ref&gt;Courrielche, Patrick, (January 25, 2017) The Wall Street Journal. "Save the Arts by Ending the Endowment" https://www.wsj.com/articles/save-the-arts-by-ending-the-endowment-1485390654&lt;/ref&gt;

Courrielche is active in the [[climate change]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Pearce]], [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/09/climate-emails-pr-disaster-peer-review 'Climategate' was PR disaster that could bring healthy reform of peer review], ''Wall Street Journalist'' (February 9, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in the investigation of [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]] ("Climategate") at the [[University of East Anglia]],&lt;ref&gt;Fred Pearce, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/09/hacked-emails-police-investigation Search for hacker may lead police back to East Anglia's climate research unit], ''The Guardian'' (February 9, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed that the affair "triggered the death of unconditional trust in the scientific peer-review process, and the maturing of a new movement of peer-to-peer review."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Trench, "Scientists' Blogs: Glimpses Behind the Scenes" in ''The Sciences' Media Connection –Public Communication and its Repercussions'' (eds. Simone Rödder, Martina Franzen &amp; Peter Weingart), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fred Pearce, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3jxSAQAAIAAJ The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming]'' ([[Guardian Books]], 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Courrielche wrote a long form story "St. Nicholas: The Birth Of A Social Weapon" on the origin of Santa Claus and introduced the concept of a "social weapon" - a packaged idea, message, or product that is used by an individual or group to advance their cause. Courrielche argued that New York City elites crafted Santa Claus from St. Nicholas, a widely known patron saint, to stabilize a city plagued by annual misbehavior every December. Santa Claus was then used as a "social weapon" by merchants, craftsman, city rulers, parents, newspapers, and others to benefit their endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;Courrielche, Patrick (December 21, 2015) The Daily Caller. "St. Nicholas: The Birth of a Social Weapon" http://dailycaller.com/2015/12/21/st-nicholas-the-birth-of-a-social-weapon/&lt;/ref&gt; The essay was added to the St. Nicholas Center's resource on the Origin of Santa Claus.&lt;ref&gt;St. Nicholas Center "St. Nicholas and the Origin of Santa Claus" http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/origin-of-santa/&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2016, Courrielche published a long form story entitled "Stream Ripping: How Google/YouTube Is Slowly Killing the Music Industry" that looked at a growing trend of alleged "music piracy" enabled by stream ripping sites - websites that rip audio from streaming music sites like [[YouTube]] - that was slowly killing the business of selling songs. The story featured [[YouTube-mp3.org]] - what Courrielche called the most highly trafficked stream ripping website in the world - and followed its founder [[Philip Matesanz]] in his creation of the site as well as his early conflicts with YouTube and its parent, [[Google]]. By tracking the former and current success of [[USA for Africa]] and it's famed song [[We Are The World]], the investigation showed how the music industry was being negatively affected by stream ripping sites like YouTube-mp3.org and highlighted how YouTube-mp3.org and Google profit from the practice of stream ripping through advertising. "After a short visit to YouTube-mp3.org, 'We Are The World' can be downloaded for free," wrote Courrielche. "USA for Africa receives nothing. The stream ripping site eventually agreed to shutdown after being sued by major record labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/tech/2017/9/4/16252348/youtube-mp3-org-shut-down|title=Major YouTube audio-ripping site agrees to shut down after getting sued by labels|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UAE nationals are permitted a number of residence visas. These are mainly used for domestic staff, but any surplus are often sold through middlemen to prostitutes to enter and remain in the country for two years. Residence visas may change hands at upwards of £5,000.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Despite a law forbidding entry to unaccompanied females under 31 years of age,&lt;ref name="ency" /&gt; "agents arrange for prostitutes to enter the country on a 30 day tourist visa.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

Although there is some [[street prostitution]], notably Hamdan Street in Abu Dhabi,&lt;ref name="national" /&gt; most prostitution takes place in the bars and nightclubs of hotels.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

==Dubai==
There has been a sex trade in Dubai for many years. In 1936, [[Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum|Sheikh Saeed]]'s ''wali'' forced the prostitutes to get married or to leave.&lt;ref name="dubai"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krane|first1=Jim|title=Dubai: The Story of the World's Fastest City|date=1 December 2009|publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1782397601|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1pbOYuGWKJgC&amp;pg=PT131&amp;lpg=PT131&amp;dq=1950%27s+%26+1960%27s,+two+madams+controlled+the+prostitutes+in+dubai#v=onepage&amp;q=1950's%20%26%201960's%2C%20two%20madams%20controlled%20the%20prostitutes%20in%20dubai&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950's &amp; 1960's, two madams controlled the [[Iran|Iranian]] prostitutes. One controlled the [[red-light district]] in [[Bur Dubai]], the other around Nasser Square (now Baniyas Square).&lt;ref name="dubai" /&gt; [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Sheikh Rashid]] ordered that all the prostitutes were rounded up and deported. This caused a [[Bank run|run]] on the local British bank when the women tried to draw out all their savings.&lt;ref name="dubai" /&gt;

Modern Dubai is one of the main centres of prostitution in the UAE and is dubbed "Sodom-sur-Mer".&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; There are estimated to be 30,000 prostitutes in the city.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt; Prostitutes frequent the bars and nightclubs in the hotels.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt; Many prostitutes from poorer countries, such as [[Nigeria]],&lt;ref name="nigeria"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banjo|first1=Temi|title=Revealed: Nigerian Ladies And Prostitution In United Arab Emirates (UAE), Dubai|url=http://www.nigerianmonitor.com/revealed-nigerian-ladies-and-prostitution-in-united-arab-emirates-uae-dubai/|website=Nigerian Monitor|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; come to work in Dubai for a short while and then return home with their earnings.

There are also [[brothels]] in Dubai.&lt;ref name="dubai" /&gt; The Cyclone, near the airport&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; was closed down in 2007 after it was featured in [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] magazine,&lt;ref name="dubai" /&gt; but the operation simply set up at another location.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Known by visitors as the ''"United Nations of prostitution"'', the club have as many as 500 prostitutes on the premises on an average night, many from [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bulgaria]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="chirico"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chirico |first1=Annalisa |title=Prostitution as a matter of freedom |url=https://eprints.luiss.it/1353/1/20141211-chirico.pdf |publisher=[[Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli]] |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human trafficking is a problem in Dubai,&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt; often Asian or Chinese gangs exploiting women from [[India]] or [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

[[File:Racist card.jpg|thumb|Literal "racist card"]]

'''Playing the race card''' is an [[idiomatic phrase]] that refers to exploitation of either [[racism|racist]] or [[anti-racist]] attitudes by accusing others of racism.

==Usage==
The phrase is commonly used to allege that someone has deliberately and falsely accused another person of being a racist in order to gain some sort of advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Playing the race card: Trump or joker? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/1292973.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2001-04-24 |accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this use of the term occurred during the [[O. J. Simpson]] [[O. J. Simpson murder case|murder trial]], when critics accused the defense of "playing the race card"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=DeWayne |last=Wickham |title=Spare Cochran legacy of 'race card' label |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/wickham/2005-04-04-cochran-legacy_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2005-04-04 |accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in presenting [[Mark Fuhrman]]'s past (e.g., his recorded use of the word "[[nigger]]" in addition to his being accused of tampering with murder evidence in prior cases, as well as his use of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to avoid potential [[self-incrimination]] upon questioning) as a reason to draw his credibility as a witness into question.

[[Stanford Law School|Stanford]] professor [[Richard Thompson Ford]] has argued that the race card can be played independent of the person making the claim, or the race in question. An example cited was the [[Hillary Clinton]] campaign's assertion that [[Barack Obama|Obama]] won the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic primary]] in [[South Carolina]] due to the disproportionate number of black registered Democrats in the state, implying more racism in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ford |first=Richard Thompson  |authorlink=Richard Thompson Ford |title=The Race Card: How Bluffing About Bias Makes Race Relations Worse |url= |edition=|year=2008 |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-374-24575-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Dei]], ''[[et alia|et al.]]'', in the book ''Playing the Race Card''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dei |first=George Jerry Sefa |authorlink= George Dei|author2=Leeno Luke Karumanchery |author3=Nisha Karumanchery-Luik |title=Playing the Race Card: Exposing White Power and Privilege |url= |edition=1st |date= January 2004 |publisher=[[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang USA]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8204-6752-8 |oclc=51266234}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the term itself is a [[rhetorical device]] used in an effort to devalue and minimize claims of racism.

==Malaysian politics==
In February 2008, Group Chief Editor Wong Chun Wai of ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' wrote, just before the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|Malaysia general election]] came, there is an unusual degree of tolerance and flexibility in matters of race, language and religion as politicians try to woo the people. "Also, there are those who still continue to play the race card, in this age and time. At their party conferences each year, they play to the gallery by projecting themselves as the communal heroes. But during the general election, they shamelessly become the true Malaysian leaders we dream of. They greet their voters in [[Malay language|Malay]], [[English language|English]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]; and if they can speak all these languages fluently, they would do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Wong Chun |last=Wai |title=All for the sake of winning votes |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/2/10/focus/20287210&amp;sec=focus |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=2008-02-10 |accessdate=2008-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604041549/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F2%2F10%2Ffocus%2F20287210&amp;sec=focus |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, the [[Singapore Institute of International Affairs]] wrote that Malaysia politician [[Khairy Jamaluddin]] "played the race card" by stirring up the [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] and the [[Chinese Malaysian]] community. Responding to criticisms and demands for an apology, Khairy said his remarks were misunderstood and he "will not apologise" as he was acting only "in defence of the Malays and his party" and that "if we truly fight for our race, one should not apologise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Use of race card stirs controversy in Malaysia |url=http://www.siiaonline.org/page/insightsDetails/id/2014/ArticleCategoryId/7 |publisher=[[Singapore Institute of International Affairs]] |date=2006-08-29 |accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because unaffiliated volunteers lack consistent [[training]], and each volunteer's [[Trust (social sciences)|trustworthiness]] is unknown, SUV management can be very difficult, and the subject of a large amount of research and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.fema.gov/pdf/donations/ManagingSpontaneousVolunteers.pdf|title = Managing Spontaneous Volunteers in Times of Disaster: The Synergy of Structure and Good Intentions|date = |access-date = January 22, 2016|website = Managing Spontaneous Unaffiliated Volunteers|publisher = FEMA|last = FEMA|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cert-la.com/education/disasterbook.pdf|title = Preventing a Disaster within the Disaster: The Effective Use and Management of Unaffiliated Volunteers|date = 2002|access-date = January 22, 2016|website = |publisher = Points of Light Foundation &amp; Volunteer Center National Network|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Managing Unaffiliated Volunteers in Times of Disaster|url = http://www.nationalservice.gov/resources/disaster-services/managing-unaffiliated-volunteers-times-disaster|website = Corporation for National and Community Service|access-date = 2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many community organizing circles, the term "Community Volunteer" is preferred, emphasizing the community-centric nature of unaffiliated [[Volunteering|volunteerism]].

==Activism==
===Naked rambling===
Gough, an ex-lorry driver, is from [[Eastleigh]], [[Hampshire]], and is known for walking the length of Great Britain from [[Land's End to John o' Groats]] over 2003 and 2004 wearing only boots, socks, a rucksack and sometimes a hat. He was arrested and imprisoned on numerous occasions during the course of his ramble.

His second [[Land's End]] to [[John o' Groats]] ramble was in 2005 and 2006 and accompanied by his girlfriend Melanie Roberts (born 1971 or 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/what-makes-a-woman-walk-for-900-547546|title=What Makes A Woman Walk For 900 Miles In The Nude?|first=|last=|date=19 June 2005|newspaper=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;). He was arrested twice in England but almost immediately released. Upon entering Scotland, he was arrested several times, the current total being over 20 including [[contempt of court]] after he appeared naked before a judge. His website claimed that ordering him to wear clothes for his court appearance "breached [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 6 - fair trial|Article 6]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]" – Right to a Fair Trial. He claimed that Articles 3 and 5 to 11 had been repeatedly breached by the authorities since he and Melanie had arrived in Scotland. He served a three-month sentence in Saughton Prison. The walk was resumed on 12 February 2006, and completed shortly after on Monday 20 February the same year. ''The Guardian'' newspaper congratulated the couple on completing their journey, stating that they were practicing [[gymnosophy]] in the tradition of people such as [[George Bernard Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/21/ruralaffairs.mainsection In praise of... the naked rambler] ''The Guardian'', 21 February 2006. Retrieved 5 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gough was involved with the [[public nudity]] advocacy group The Freedom to be Yourself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stop-racist-human-skin-phobia.org/ Stop Racist Human Skin Phobia] Steve Gough – Naked Rambler. Retrieved 5 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Six years in prison===
Gough was arrested again on 19 May 2006 at [[Edinburgh Airport]] after removing his clothes during a flight from Southampton to Edinburgh and refusing to get dressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/4994596.stm "Rambler held over mid-air strip"], BBC News, 18 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 August 2006 he was given a seven-month jail sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=952&amp;id=1260792006 "Nude rambler won't dress despite latest prison term",] ''The Scotsman'', 26 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 April 2007 Gough was cleared of charges related to his refusal to dress upon being released into Saughton Prison car park in Edinburgh. The ruling judge, Isobel Poole, found that there was no evidence of "actual alarm or disturbance", adding "I can understand this conduct could be considered unpleasant to passers-by had there been any but there is a lack of evidence to that effect."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6542329.stm "Naked rambler cleared by sheriff"], BBC News, 10 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, Gough lost his appeal against contempt of court convictions for refusing to wear clothes during his 2005 trial and had another 3 months added to his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7120889.stm |title=Naked rambler jailed for contempt |work=BBC News|date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, after spending most of the previous 20 months in jail (being rearrested for nudity each time he was released and each time he appeared in court), Gough was released and told that if he went for three months without appearing naked in public he would not be returned to jail for outstanding convictions; two hours later he left the court naked and was immediately re-arrested and subsequently returned to jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7196711.stm Naked Rambler free for six steps] ''BBC News'', 18 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Gough served his time in [[Barlinnie Prison]] and was released on 14 October 2008, when he was again immediately arrested for leaving the prison naked. On 14 November, he was cleared of that offence on the grounds of insufficient evidence, but appeared in the dock naked and was rearrested in the foyer of Glasgow Sheriff Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7730371.stm Naked rambler cleared of breach] BBC News, 14 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 December he was convicted of a [[breach of the peace]] and sentenced to a further 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7790299.stm "More jail time for naked rambler"], BBC News, 18 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Gough, once again standing in the dock naked, was jailed at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] for a further 12 months for breach of the peace. Sheriff MacFarlane was told that the bill for dealing with Gough had cost the public an estimated several hundred thousand pounds. The court heard how Gough had finished a previous jail term at Perth Prison and was released to enjoy freedom for the first time in several months. His freedom lasted less than 30 seconds after he walked naked from the prison door to Edinburgh Road. Gough was also sentenced to four months for refusing to dress before the trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/8154475.stm "Naked rambler is back behind bars"], BBC News, 16 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

While in jail in Perth, on 6 July 2009, Stephen Gough received a visit from two members of the French ''[[Association pour la promotion du naturisme en liberté]]'' (Association for the Promotion of Naturism in Liberty), which is tracking his activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnel.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?id=49 Association pour la promotion du naturisme en liberté] A French forum of Steve Gough supporters. Includes articles written in English.&lt;/ref&gt;
On 8 February 2010 Gough was convicted of breach of the peace and contempt of court, charges relating to walking naked in Perth and appearing naked in court. He was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment, his longest sentence to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/8504762.stm "Naked rambler's longest sentence"], BBC News, 8 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2010 he was found guilty of: on 26 October 2010, conducting himself in a disorderly manner, standing naked at the gates of Perth Prison, refusing to wear any clothing or otherwise cover his genitals and committing a breach of the peace. He was sentenced to 15 months and 26 days. He is understood to spend his time in prison in [[solitary confinement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecourier.co.uk/News/Perthshire/article/8033/naked-rambler-stephen-gough-sent-back-to-prison.html 'Naked rambler' Stephen Gough sent back to prison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526110509/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/News/Perthshire/article/8033/naked-rambler-stephen-gough-sent-back-to-prison.html |date=26 May 2011 }}, Dundee Courier, 26 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on 20 July 2011, but immediately rearrested after leaving the prison naked, and received another 657-day sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-14649394|title='Naked rambler' Steven Gough jailed again|author=|date=24 August 2011|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From 2012===
When that sentence concluded on 17 July 2012, he left the prison naked again, but this time the police allowed him to go on his way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-18873631 Naked rambler walks free from Perth Prison] BBC News, Tayside and Central Scotland, 17 July 2012; retrieved 17 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, on 20 July, he was rearrested by [[Fife Police]] for a breach of the peace in [[Townhill, Fife|Townhill]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-18931494 Naked rambler Stephen Gough arrested again] BBC News, East Fife, 20 July 2012; retrieved 20 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2012 he was sentenced to five months in prison. He had refused to allow social workers to assess his mental health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/13/naked-rambler-back-to-prison |title=Naked Rambler sent back to prison |work=The Guardian |date=13 September 2012 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; after he broke down in court during an appearance on 23 August.

Released in early October 2012, he walked from Saughton to [[Edale]], [[Derbyshire]] during October, continuing across the English border down the [[Pennine Way]] to Edale by 31 October, with two arrests en route in [[Hebden Bridge]] and [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. Released on bail, he continued to walk south and was due back in Court on 5 February 2013 to face public order charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/local/updated-rambler-walking-through-halifax-town-centre-naked-this-afternoon-police-arrest-him-for-second-time-1-5063824 |title=UPDATED: Rambler walking through Halifax town centre naked this afternoon – police arrest him for second time |work=Halifax Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested in [[Carterton, Oxfordshire|Carterton]], [[Oxfordshire]], on suspicion of outraging public decency on 4 December and was then refused bail and spent Christmas 2012 in jail after his application for bail was refused.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-20808837 Naked rambler Stephen Gough to spend Christmas in jail] BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 2013 Gough was imprisoned for 11 months for breaching an [[antisocial behaviour order]] (ASBO) on 28 February minutes after it was granted, having recently returned home. Gough was not allowed to appear in court as he refused to wear clothes.&lt;ref name=BBC2013-June-19&gt;{{cite news|title='Naked rambler' Stephen Gough jailed for flouting Asbo|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-22971063|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thej_Thes"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The strangest sight in a British courtroom - and I'm not talking about the naked man - The Justice Gap | last = Scheurer | first = Vincent | work = The Justice Gap | date = 13 October 2014 | accessdate = 2015-09-09 | url = http://thejusticegap.com/2014/10/strangest-sight-british-courtroom-im-talking-naked-man/ | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 he was again jailed for breaching his ASBO this time with a sentence of 16 months .&lt;ref name=bbcjan14&gt;{{cite news |date=6 January 2014  |title='Naked rambler' Stephen Gough jailed for Asbo breach |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-25629531 |newspaper=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On his release from [[Winchester Prison]] he walked out wearing only footwear, once again breaching the ASBO, and in October 2014 he was sentenced to a further two and a half years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Naked rambler' Stephen Gough jailed for Asbo breach|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-29528084|accessdate=8 October 2014|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2014, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that European laws protecting privacy and freedom of expression did not apply to Gough's naked rambling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Naked Rambler' Stephen Gough Loses Legal Battle to Bare All|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/naked-rambler-stephen-gough-loses-legal-battle-bare-all-n235361|accessdate=28 October 2014|work=NBC News (online)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2015 Stephen Gough was released from Winchester prison. At around 6:30am he got into a car inside the prison grounds and was transported from Winchester to Sussex. On his release from prison, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', described him as a previous 'prisoner of conscience.'&lt;ref name=SundayTimes-1593666&gt;{{cite news|title=Even a return to solitary won't stop me wandering as nature intended|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/newsreview/features/article1593666.ece|author=Alev Scott|date=16 August 2015|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Finkelstein]] wrote about Gough and his practice of unlimited naturism in ''[[The Times]]'' just before Christmas 2015:

{{quote|Our standards of modesty and decency have changed so much and so rapidly that it is hard to believe that they won't change further, making complete nudity perfectly normal. In anticipating this, Stephen Gough is not dotty, he is just slightly ahead of the rest of us. And when he puts his case to be allowed his nudity, it is hard to resist. The rest of us are the dotty ones, insisting upon dress for which there frankly isn't a reasonable argument. Yet he should still go to jail.&lt;ref name="Finkelstein"&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkelstein|first=Daniel|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article4648118.ece|title=The naked truth is this man must be locked up|work=The Times|location=London|date=23 December 2015|accessdate=23 December 2015}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

In Finkelstein's opinion: "The refusal of individuals to abide by court rulings is deeply injurious to a free society based upon law, and we have to protect ourselves against it."&lt;ref name="Finkelstein"/&gt;

===''Who Bares Wins''===
A comedic theatrical production invoking Gough's initial naked ramble of 2003–2004 titled ''Who Bares Wins'' was produced by Scottish theatre company Right Lines Productions in 2004. The play, written by Euan Martin and Dave Smith and directed by Mark Saunders, followed the Rambler on his journey through the Scottish countryside and his numerous stints in Scottish prisons.

Set against the backdrop of a remote community eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Rambler for its own reasons, ''Who Bares Wins'' explores society's wide range of attitudes to nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rightlines.net/rightlines/sample-page/who-bares-wins-2/|title=Who Bares Wins|author=|date=|website=Right Lines Productions|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play, starring Ron Emslie and [[Alyth McCormack]], toured Scotland and was seen by Gough himself, without clothes on, at The Universal Hall, [[Findhorn Foundation|Findhorn]], in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northings.com/2007/09/01/hitn-profile-right-lines-productions/|title=HITN Profile: Right Lines Productions|author=|date=1 September 2007|website=Northings|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But most outsiders refers them as '''To Wana''' which means "people in the forest" because of their social image as a community residing in forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4669620/Ethnoecological_System_of_Tao_Taa_Wana_In_the_Morowali_Nature_Reserve_Central_Sulawesi_Indonesia |title=Ethnoecological System of  Tao Taa Wana Tribe In The Morowali Nature Reserve, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia |author=Ramadhanil Pitopang |year=2012 |publisher=academia.edu |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tau Taa Wana people are an [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous tribe]] who live in small villages or ''lipu's'' around the Bulang and [[Bongka River]]. Since the year 2000, the Wana have implemented rotational farming as a means of maintaining themselves. Before this they lived as a [[nomadic tribe]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Monnig Atkinson, 1989, The Art and Politics of Wana Shamanship, University of California Press, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tau Taa Wana are currently under threat. This is mainly constituted over land trouble. Since 1994 incursions from the government of Indonesia's [[Transmigration operation|transmigration]] program have affected their traditional ways of life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestpeoples.org/documents/asia_pacific/indonesia_wana_visit_mc_mar09_eng.pdf{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Yayasan Merah Putih]]'' is a [[non-profit]], [[NGO]] in [[Palu]] that has been a supporter of Wana rights since 1999 and has also introduced ''sekolah lipu's'' or village schools in order to help the Tau Taa Wana community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ymp.or.id/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Team conflict''' is [[Organizational conflict|conflict]] within a [[team]].

== Causes ==
Conflicts may be caused by differing goals, values or perceptions of the team members.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Tony Alessandra, Phil Hunsaker |year=1993 |title=Communicating at Work |publisher=Fireside Publishers |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Faultlines" in groups ===
Lau and Murnighan identify what they call "faultlines" as a source of conflicts within groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=Dora C.|last2=Murnighan|first2=J. Keith|date=1998|title=Demographic Diversity and Faultines: The Compositional Dynamics of Organizational Groups|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dora_Lau/publication/259461922_Demographic_Diversity_and_Faultlines_The_Compositional_Dynamics_of_Organizational_Groups/links/0c96052bd053167cd5000000.pdf|volume=23|issue=2|pages=325–340}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a supplement to traditional approaches of research that focused on diversity characterized by variance of demographic attributes across a population,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inequality and composition: A primitive theory of social structure.|last=Blau|first=P. M.|publisher=|year=1977|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Reilly|first=Charles A.|last2=Caldwell|first2=David F.|last3=Barnett|first3=William P.|date=1989-01-01|title=Work Group Demography, Social Integration, and Turnover|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=34|issue=1|pages=21–37|doi=10.2307/2392984|jstor=2392984}}&lt;/ref&gt; faultlines are hypothetical dividing lines that split groups into multiple sets of subgroups with each set based on different attributes. These attributes may be [[Demography|demographics]], but also may be characteristics such as personal values or personalities. This work builds on work in [[social identity theory]] and [[self-categorization theory]], which explains the ways in which individuals favor other individuals with whom they share a common identity;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Michael A.|last2=Terry|first2=Deborah I.|date=2000-01-01|title=Social Identity and Self-Categorization Processes in Organizational Contexts|url=http://amr.aom.org/content/25/1/121|journal=Academy of Management Review|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=121–140|doi=10.5465/AMR.2000.2791606|issn=0363-7425}}&lt;/ref&gt; per this model, individuals evaluate members of their subgroups more positively than other members of the larger group, which may lead to conflict when disagreements occur across faultlines. Lau and Murnighan identify three compositional factors for faultlines within a group:
# The number of individual attributes apparent to group members
# Their alignment
# The number of potentially homogenous subgroups
A group has weak faultlines if subgroups contain different members across sets, and strong faultlines if group members fall in the same groups across sets. For example, a team composed half of young male entry-level employees and half of older female executives has strong faultlines because each member falls in subgroups with the same other members across all three demographic characteristics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Subsequent work on the impact of these embedded subgroups, called "factions" when overlap in subgroups is structured into teams, has found significant negative impacts on group productivity stemming from task conflict, emotional conflict, and behavioral disintegration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Jiatao|last2=Hambrick|first2=Donald C.|date=2005-10-01|title=Factional Groups: A New Vantage on Demographic Faultlines, Conflict, and Disintegration in Work Teams|url=http://amj.aom.org/content/48/5/794|journal=Academy of Management Journal|language=en|volume=48|issue=5|pages=794–813|doi=10.5465/AMJ.2005.18803923|issn=0001-4273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faultlines were found to better predict variance in a variety of group self-perception metrics than traditional metrics of group heterogeneity, including perceptions of team-learning, psychological safety, satisfaction, and expected performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=Dora C.|last2=Murnighan|first2=J. Keith|date=2005-08-01|title=Interactions Within Groups and Subgroups: The Effects of Demographic Faultlines|url=http://amj.aom.org/content/48/4/645|journal=Academy of Management Journal|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=645–659|doi=10.5465/AMJ.2005.17843943|issn=0001-4273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that, while the concept of faultlines model may be seen as presenting diversity as a challenge to be overcome, diversity has been found to contribute significantly to team outcomes under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60133-1|title=Toward A Theory of Conversion Behavior|last=Moscovici|first=Serge|pages=209–239|language=en|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60133-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Minority Influence|last=Muscovici|first=S.|publisher=Nelson-Hall Publishers|year=1994|isbn=|editor1=Muscovici, S.|editor2=Mucchi-Faina, A.|editor3=Maass, A.|location=Chicago|pages=233–251|chapter=Three concepts: Minority, conflict, and behavioral-style}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respectful inclusion of the opinions of minority members can lead to increased creativity as the group incorporates their distinct perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jehn|first=Karen A.|date=1995-01-01|title=A Multimethod Examination of the Benefits and Detriments of Intragroup Conflict|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=40|issue=2|pages=256–282|doi=10.2307/2393638|jstor=2393638}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges associated with inclusivity are not insubstantial, and may require strong [[leadership]] and norms of tolerance and respect to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alderfer|first=Clayton P.|date=1991-06-01|title=Changing Race Relations in Organizations: A Critique of the Contact Hypothesis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1936-4490.1991.tb00547.x/abstract|journal=Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences / Revue Canadienne des Sciences de l'Administration|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=80–88|doi=10.1111/j.1936-4490.1991.tb00547.x|issn=1936-4490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of conflicts ==
"Hot conflicts"{{explain|date=January 2018}} have three common symptoms:
* Team members persist in arguing the same points.
* When the team reaches impasse, talks gets personal. Accusations may be spoken out loud, and members may speculate privately about one another’s motives.
* Once negative attributions take hold, emotions flare and progress halts.

Allen C. Amason, of Mississippi State University, studied conflict and its role in decision-making.  He stated that there are two kinds of conflict: cognitive — conflict based upon issues, ideas, processes or principles — and affective — conflict based upon personalities, emotions or values.

Researcher Thomas K. Capozzoli (1995) classified conflicts by whether the outcome was constructive or destructive.  Conflicts are constructive when people change and grow personally from the conflict; the conflict results in a solution to a problem; the involvement of everyone affected by the conflict is increased; the team becomes more cohesive.  Conflicts are destructive when no decision is reached and problem still exists; energy is diverted away from productive activities; the morale of the team members goes down; the team becomes divided.

=== Workplace conflict ===
{{Main|Workplace conflict}}
Team conflict is common in the workplace where it may hinder productivity and the achievement of team goals.  If management of conflict is not effective, it can disrupt  group processes, but successfully-managed conflict may benefit the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Organizational Behavior|last=George|first=J. M.|last2=Jones|first2=G. R.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Six-step procedure for dealing with conflict in teams ==
Conflict is a normal part of working in teams, because it brings creativity and helps avoid [[groupthink]]. However, too much conflict can stop teams for doing their work and certain procedures should be followed to get back on track. Guffey, Rhodes, and Rogin describe their six-step process for dealing with conflict in teams:&lt;ref&gt;Guffey, Mary Ellen, Kathleen Rhodes and Patricia Rogin. "Business Communication: Process and Product." Toronto: Thomson South-Western, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Listen: In order for everyone to understand the problem.
# Understand the other's point of view: Listening makes understanding the other's position easier. Show this by asking questions.
# Show a concern for the relationship: Focus on the problem, not the person. Show that his or her needs are cared for and an overall willingness to resolve the conflict.
# Look for common ground: Identify both sides' interest and see what you have in common.
# Invent new problem-solving options: Brainstorm on new ways to solve the conflict and be sure to be open to new suggestions.
# Reach an agreement on what's fair: Find a middle ground of whats fair and choose the best options after weighing the possible solutions.

'''''The Gypsy and the Gentleman''''' is a 1958 British [[costume drama]] film directed by [[Joseph Losey]]. It stars [[Melina Mercouri]] and [[Keith Michell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/work/the-gypsy-and-the-gentleman-94123|title=The Gypsy and the Gentleman (1958) - Joseph Losey - Synopsis, Characteristics, Moods, Themes and Related - AllMovie|website=AllMovie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6abb134d|title=The Gypsy and the Gentleman (1958)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Plot==
The beautiful and fiery gypsy Belle (Melina Mercouri) marries Regency playboy Sir Paul Deverill (Keith Michell) for his money. Unbeknownst to her he has squandered his fortune and is desperately in debt. When Deverill's sister Sarah (June Laverick) inherits a fortune, the couple's frustrated plots to steal it from her lead to their eventual demise.

==Critical reception==
Derek Winnert wrote, "The movie is hardly director Losey’s usual cup of tea, but he tries to get some bite into the gold-digger themes and the 18th century rural England period setting. And the whirlwind Mercouri acts up a storm, certainly ringing that Belle loud and clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derekwinnert.com/the-gypsy-and-the-gentlemen-1958-melina-mercouri-keith-michell-flora-robson-classic-movie-review-5848/|title=The Gypsy and the Gentlemen *** (1958, Melina Mercouri, Keith Michell, Flora Robson, Patrick McGoohan, June Laverick, Helen Haye, Lyndon Brook) – Classic Movie Review 5848 - Derek Winnert|website=www.derekwinnert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Queen of Drum''' is a [[narrative poem]] by [[C.S. Lewis]] published by J.M. Dent in 1969, post-humously by Lewis' trustee and literary adviser [[Walter Hooper]].&lt;ref&gt;Narrative Poems. C.S. Lewis. Walter Hooper ed., Fount Paperbacks, London, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted for its varying meter, but has been criticised for having a weak plot. &lt;ref&gt;King, Don W; ''C.S. Lewis, poet: the legacy of his poetic impulse'', Kent State University Press 2001, p153 {{ISBN|978-0-87338-681-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is included in the novel ''[[Dymer]]''
==Synopsis==
In this poignant poem, the Kingdom of Drum is subject to a palace revolution: the top-ranked army general cleanly disposes of the aged king and proclaims himself the replacement monarch. The spirited, young queen - ordered to promptly remarry the general - pretends acquiescence: escaping en route to her place of incarceration.

With the hue-and-cry being raised in pursuit behind her, the fugitive queen employs her woodland skills to lose herself quickly in the depths of the forest. On the move - and free for the moment - she faces a choice of how best she might remove herself beyond the risk of recapture.&lt;ref&gt;Narrative Poems. C.S. Lewis. Walter Hooper ed., Fount Paperbacks, London, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tlapitzalli''' is an [[aerophone]] known from [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican]] cultures, particularly the [[Aztec]].

The tlapitzalli could be multi-chambered, examples using up to four chambers are known. Tlapitzalli was also a term that was used to refer to the [[conch shell]] trumpets used to coordinate attacks during Aztec war ceremonies.

The name comes from the [[Nahuatl language]].

'''Uruguayan Mexicans''' are people born in [[Uruguay]] who live in [[Mexico]], or Mexican-born people of Uruguayan descent. 

== Overview ==
There are lots of Uruguayan-born persons living in Mexico, for a number of reasons. Both countries share the [[Spanish language]]; the historical origins of both nations is common (part of the [[Spanish Empire]] until the early 19th century); Mexico has a much bigger economy, which attracted Uruguayans in search of opportunities; and, from the political point of view, during the [[civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay]] (1973-1985), ideological affinity made Mexico attractive as an exile destination for several Uruguayans.

Uruguayan residents in Mexico have their own institutions, for instance, the Consultative Councils in [[Mexico City]], [[Cancun]], [[Puebla]], and [[Toluca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.d20.org.uy/Lista-de-Consejos |title=List of Consultative Councils of Uruguayans abroad |accessdate=1 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809011138/http://www.d20.org.uy/Lista-de-Consejos |archive-date=9 August 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''šargija''' ([[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: Шаргија, {{lang-sq| Sharki}}) is a [[Plucked string instrument|plucked]], [[fret]]ted long necked [[chordophone]] used in the [[folk music]] of various [[Balkans|Balkan]] countries, including [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Albania]],  and [[Serbia]].

The šargija originated in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the rule of [[Ottoman Empire]], and is played by [[Bosniaks]], [[Albanians]], [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]].  Its original four strings have been increased to six or even seven. The šargija usually accompanies the [[violin]], and has a jangling sound, similar to the Turkish [[baglama|saz]].
The sharki (or sargija) is a similar instrument as the two-string qiftelia, but with more strings and looking more like a primitive saz. Spelling is sometimes: sarkia or sharki or sharkia. Usually there are three courses of metal strings. The frets are often inlaid metal frets, in a non-western pattern. Body could be made from separate staves, or carved from one piece of wood.

==Use==
The šargija is used by the [[Bosnians]] in [[Bosnian root music]]. The [[tamburica]]/[[Tambura (instrument)|tambura]] is mostly associated with Croats and some Serbs.
