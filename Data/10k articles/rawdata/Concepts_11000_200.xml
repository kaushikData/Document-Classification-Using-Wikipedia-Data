In mathematics, an '''adhesive category''' is a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] where [[Pushout (category theory)|pushout]]s of monomorphisms exist and work more or less as they do in the category of sets.  An example of an adhesive category is the category of directed multigraphs, or [[Quiver (mathematics)|quiver]]s, and the theory of adhesive categories is important in the theory of [[graph rewriting]].

More precisely, an adhesive category is one where any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

* ''C'' has all [[pullback]]s, it has pushouts along [[monomorphism]]s, and pushout squares of monomorphisms are also pullback squares and are stable under pullback.
* ''C'' has all pullbacks, it has pushouts along monomorphisms, and the latter are also (bicategorical) pushouts in the [[bicategory]] of [[Span (category theory)|span]]s in&amp;nbsp;''C''.

If ''C'' is small, we may equivalently say that ''C'' has all pullbacks, has pushouts along monomorphisms, and admits a full embedding into a [[Grothendieck topos]] preserving pullbacks and preserving pushouts of monomorphisms.

This could include disfavor of movements attempting to spread democracy, capitalism, or certain themes of social life present in more "western" nations or cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Modernization Imperative|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DNuRi9CMtgAC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=anti+modernization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IoB_xb8jF-&amp;sig=GSQi2IZrdXxsuPwXxuqzf6IBEck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jF-hVePrPIH0-QGnjq-YCA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Imprint Academic|date = 2003|isbn = 9780907845522|first = Bruce|last = Charlton|first2 = Peter|last2 = Andras}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boris Rumer]] wrote in his book ''Central Asia at the End of the Transition'' (2005) that "anti-modernization is appearing in all spheres of culture and economics. The retraditionalization of social life, deprofessionalization of entire strata of the population, the anti-intellectualism emanating from above, the exodus of skilled personnel from the country{{spaced ndash}}these are all clear signs of the anti-modernization that characterizes the reality in post-Soviet [[Uzbekistan]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This constitutes an example of how some people in certain places view movements of modernization. People(s) involved with the anti modernization movement sometimes perceive that western societies live in a culture that leads its people to be dominated by the people above them either economically or politically. This can be seen as severely negative and as representative of oppression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples through history ==
There was an apparent anti-modernization movement in [[Iran]] in the 1960s and 1970s was said to be "an attempt to reconcile...modernity with the Islamic and Iranian contexts".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Ali Mirsepassi|Mirsepassi, Ali]] (2000).

[[File:Du200613.png|thumb|right|Cuckoo clock, a so-called Jagdstück (Hunt piece), Black Forest, ca. 1900, Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 2006-013]]

A '''cuckoo clock''' is a typically [[pendulum clock|pendulum-regulated]] [[clock]] that [[striking clock|strikes the hours]] with a sound like a [[common cuckoo|common cuckoo's]] call and has an automated cuckoo bird that moves with each note. Some move their wings and open/close their beaks while leaning forward, whereas in others, only the bird's body leans forward. The mechanism to produce the cuckoo call has been in use since the middle of the 18th century and has remained almost without variation until the present.

It is unknown who invented it and where the first one was made. It is thought that much of its development and evolution was made in the [[Black Forest]] area in southwestern Germany (State of [[Baden-Württemberg]]), the region where the cuckoo clock was popularized. The cuckoo clocks were exported to the rest of the world from the mid 1850s on. Today, the cuckoo clock is one of the favourite souvenirs of travelers in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Austria]]. It has become a [[cultural icon]] of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Neville-Hadley |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2016/03/21/germanys-black-forest-clock-route-full-of-surprises |title=Germany's Black Forest clock route full of surprises |publisher=torontosun.com |date=2016-04-03 |accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ross Sveback |url=http://www.fox9.com/good-day/ross-sveback/11720211-story |title=Cuckoo for cuckoo clocks |publisher=fox9.com |date=2015-08-25 |accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
The design of a cuckoo clock is now conventional. Most are made in the "traditional style" (also known as "carved") or "[[chalet]]" to hang on a wall. In the "traditional style" the wooden case is decorated with carved leaves and animals. They have an [[automaton]] of the bird that appears through a small trap door while the clock is striking. The bird is often made to move as the clock strikes, typically by means of an arm that lifts the back of the carving.

There are two kinds of movements: one-day (30-hour) and eight-day clockworks. Some have musical devices, and play a tune on a Swiss [[music box]] after striking the hours and half-hours. Usually the melody sounds only at full hours in eight-day clocks and both at full and half hours in the one-day timepieces. Musical cuckoo clocks frequently have other automata which move when the music box plays. Today's cuckoo clocks are almost always weight driven, though a very few are spring driven. The weights are made of cast iron in a [[pine cone]] shape and the "cuc-koo" sound is created by two tiny [[gedackt]] pipes in the clock, with bellows attached to their tops. The clock's movement activates the bellows to send a puff of air into each pipe alternately when the timekeeper strikes.

In recent years, [[quartz clock|quartz]] battery-powered cuckoo clocks have become available. As with their mechanical counterparts, the cuckoo bird emerges from its enclosure and moves up and down, but on the quartz timepieces it also flaps its wings and open its beak while it sings. During the call the double doors open and the cuckoo emerges as usual, but only on the full hour, and they do not have a gong wire chime. The movement of the cuckoo in such clocks is regulated by an electromagnet that pulses on and off, attracting a weight, that acts as a [[Lever|fulcrum]], connected to the tail of the plastic cuckoo bird, thus moving the bird up and down in his enclosure. Instead of the call being reproduced by the traditional [[bellows]], it is a digital recording of a cuckoo calling in the wild (with a corresponding [[echo]]). The cuckoo call is usually accompanied by the sound of a [[waterfall]] and other birds in the background.

In musical quartz clocks, the hourly chime is followed by the replay of one of twelve popular melodies (one for each hour). Some musical quartz clocks also reproduce many of the popular automata found on mechanical musical clocks, such as [[beer]] drinkers, [[wood-choppers]], and jumping [[deer]].

Uniquely, quartz cuckoo clocks often include a sensor, so that when the lights are turned off at night they automatically silence the hourly chime. Other quartz cuckoo clocks are pre-programmed not to strike between a set of pre-determined hours. Whether this is controlled by a light sensor or pre-programmed, the function is referred to as a 'night silence' feature. On quartz clocks the weights are conventionally cast in the shape of Aleppo [[pine]] [[Conifer cone|cones]] made of plastic rather than iron, as are as the cuckoo bird and clock hands. The [[pendulum]] bob is often another carved leaf. Here, the weights and pendulum are purely ornamental as the clock is driven by battery power. As with mechanical cuckoo clocks, the dial is usually small, and typically marked with [[Roman numerals]].

==History==

===First modern cuckoo clocks===
[[File:dukirch.gif|thumb|right|150px|Mechanical cuckoo, 1650.]]

In 1629, many decades before clockmaking was established in the [[Black Forest]],&lt;ref&gt;For the early history of Black Forest clockmaking, see Gerd Bender, "Die Uhrenmacher des hohen Schwarzwaldes und ihre Werke". Vol. 1 (Villingen, 1975): pp. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Augsburg]] nobleman by the name of [[Philipp Hainhofer]] (1578–1647) penned the first known description of a modern cuckoo clock.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock. A Success Story''. NAWCC Bulletin, December 2006: p. 646.&lt;/ref&gt;  The clock belonged to Prince Elector [[August, Elector of Saxony|August von Sachsen]].

Likewise, in a widely known handbook on music, ''Musurgia Universalis'' (1650), the scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]] describes a mechanical organ with several automated figures, including a mechanical cuckoo. This book contains the first documented description—in words and pictures—of how a mechanical cuckoo works.&lt;ref&gt;Athanasius Kircher, ''Musurgia Universalis sive Ars magna consoni &amp; dissoni'', 2 Vol (Rome, 1650), here Vol. 2, p. 343f and Plate XXI.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that Kircher did not invent the cuckoo mechanism, because this book, like his other works, is a compilation of known facts into a handbook for reference purposes. The engraving clearly shows all the elements of a mechanical cuckoo. The bird automatically opens its beak and moves both its wings and tail. Simultaneously, there is heard the [[whistle]]—call of the cuckoo, created by two organ pipes, tuned to a minor or major third. There is only one fundamental difference from the Black Forest-type cuckoo mechanism: The functions of Kircher's bird are not governed by a count wheel in a strike train, but a pinned program barrel synchronizes the movements and sounds of the bird.

On the other hand, in 1669 [[Domenico Martinelli]], in his handbook on elementary clocks ''Horologi Elementari'', suggests using the call of the cuckoo to indicate the hours.&lt;ref&gt;Domenico Martinelli, ''Horologi Elementari'' (Venezia, 1669): p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting at that time the mechanism of the cuckoo clock was known. Any mechanic or clockmaker, who could read Latin or Italian, knew after reading the books that it was feasible to have the cuckoo announce the hours.

Subsequently, cuckoo clocks appeared in regions that had not been known for their clockmaking. For instance, the ''Historische Nachrichten'' (1713), an anonymous publication generally attributed to Court Preacher Bartholomäus Holzfuss, mentions a musical clock in the [[Oranienburg]] palace in [[Berlin]]. This clock, originating in [[West Prussia]], played eight church hymns and had a cuckoo that announced the quarter hours.&lt;ref&gt;''Geheimes Staatsarchiv Preussischer Kulturbesitz''. Document No.:"I.HA, Rep. 36, Nr. 3048, fol. 21f": "In another room, where the Dutch porcelain is kept, is a singing clock, which was made by a farmer in [[Kashubia|Kaschuben]], which plays eight hymns; but the quarter hours are called out by a cuckoo". See also Claudia Sommer, ''[[Schloss Oranienburg]]. Ein Inventar aus dem Jahre 1743'', p. 151, where there is also a reference to a currently missing inventory of 1709. The inventory of 1702 does not yet list this clock; therefore, it is probable that it reached Oranienburg between 1702 and 1709, ''Verwaltung der Märkischen Schlösser'').&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately this clock, like the one mentioned by Hainhofer in 1629, can no longer be traced today.&lt;ref&gt;It remains doubtful which is the oldest cuckoo clock before the bird made its appearance in the Black Forest. Again and again old iron or wooden clock movements are discovered, which have automated cuckoos that possibly predate the first wooden movement cuckoo clocks from the Black Forest. (See also Wilhelm Schneider, "Die eiserne Kuckucksuhr" (The Iron Movement Cuckoo Clock), ''Alte Uhren und Moderne Zeitmessung'', No. 5 (1989): pp. 37–44).&lt;/ref&gt;

A few decades later, people in the Black Forest started to build cuckoo clocks.

===First cuckoo clocks made in the Black Forest===
[[File:Du320.png|thumb|right|150px|Early cuckoo clock, Black Forest, 1760–1780 (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 03-2002)]]

It is not clear who built the first cuckoo clocks in the [[Black Forest]]&lt;ref&gt;Also refer to the discussion on the origin of the Black Forest cuckoo clock to: Richard Mühe, Helmut Kahlert and Beatrice Techen, ''Kuckucksuhren'' (München, 1988): pp. 7–14.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is unanimity that the unusual clock with the bird call very quickly conquered the region. Already by the middle of the 18th century, several small clockmaking shops produced cuckoo clocks with wooden gears. So the first Black Forest examples were created between 1740 and 1750. The earliest Black Forest examples had shields decorated with paper.&lt;ref&gt;* Miller, Justin , Rare and Unusual Black Forest Clocks, (Schiffer 2012), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hard to judge how large the proportion of cuckoo clocks was among the total production of modern movement Black Forest clocks. Based on the proportions of pieces surviving to the present, it must have been a small fraction of the total production.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Kahlert, ''Die Kuckucksuhren-Saga, Alte Uhren'', No. 4 (1983): pp. 347–353; here p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding its murky origins, there are two main fables from the first two chroniclers of Black Forest horology which tell contradicting stories about it:

The first is from Father Franz Steyrer, written in his "Geschichte der Schwarzwälder Uhrmacherkunst" (History of the Art of Clockmaking in the Black Forest) in 1796. He describes a meeting between two clock peddlers from Furtwangen (a town in the Black Forest) who met a travelling Bohemian merchant who sold wooden cuckoo clocks. Both the Furtwangen traders were so excited that they bought one. On bringing it home they copied it and showed their imitation to other Black Forest clock traders. Its popularity grew in the region and more and more clockmakers started producing them. With regard to this chronicle, the historian Adolf Kistner claimed in his book "Die Schwarzwälder Uhr" (The Black Forest Clock) published in 1927, that there is not any Bohemian cuckoo clock in existence to verify the thesis that this clock was used as a sample to copy and produce Black Forest cuckoo clocks. Bohemia had no fundamental clockmaking industry during that period.

[[File:Wildi-Kuckuck.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Exemplary by Johannes Wildi, [[Eisenbach]], ca. 1780. (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 2008-024)]]

The second story is related by another priest, Markus Fidelis Jäck, in a passage extracted from his report "Darstellungen aus der Industrie und des Verkehrs aus dem Schwarzwald" (Descriptions of the Industry and the Traffic of the Black Forest), (1810) said as follows: "The cuckoo clock was invented (in 1730) by a clock-master [Franz Anton Ketterer] from Schönwald [literally "Beautiful Forest", i.e. the Black Forest]. This craftsman adorned a clock with a moving bird that announced the hour with the cuckoo-call. The clock-master got the idea of how to make the cuckoo-call from the bellows of a church organ". As time went on, the second version became the more popular, and is the one generally related today. Unfortunately, neither Steyrer nor Jäck quote any sources for their claims, making them unverifiable.

On the other side, R. Dorer pointed out, in 1948, that Franz Anton Ketterer (1734–1806) could not have been the inventor of the cuckoo clock in 1730 because he had not yet been born.

This statement was corroborated by Gerd Bender in the most recent edition of the first volume of his work ''Die Uhrenmacher des hohen Schwarzwaldes und ihre Werke'' (''The Clockmakers of the High Black Forest and their Works'') (1998) in which he wrote that the cuckoo clock was not native to the Black Forest and also stated that: "There are no traces of the first production line of cuckoo clocks made by Ketterer".

However, Schaaf in ''Schwarzwalduhren'' (''Black Forest Clocks'') (1995), provides his own research which leads to the earliest cuckoos having been built in the ''Franken-Niederbayern'' area ("Franconia and Lower Bavaria", in the southeast of Germany, forming nowadays the northern two-thirds of the Free State of Bavaria), in the direction of [[Bohemia]] (nowadays the main region of the Czech Republic), which he notes, lends credence to the Steyrer version.

The legend that the cuckoo clock was invented by a clever Black Forest mechanic in 1730 (Franz Anton Ketterer) keeps being told over and over again. But all of this is not true.&lt;ref name="Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock. A Success Story'' p. 651"&gt;Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock: A Success Story''. In: NAWCC Bulletin, December 2006: p. 651.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of clock is much older than clockmaking in the Black Forest. As early as 1650 the bird with the distinctive call was part of the reference book knowledge recorded in handbooks. It took nearly a century for the cuckoo clock to find its way to the Black Forest, where for many decades it remained a tiny niche product.

[[File:Rahmenuhr mit Blechschild "Kuckucksuhrenwerkstatt".jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rahmenuhr by J. Laule depicting a scene of a Black Forest clockmaker's shop. Furtwangen, ca. 1860 (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 07-0068)]]

Although the idea of placing an automaton cuckoo bird in a clock to announce the passing of time did not originate in the [[Black Forest]], it is necessary to emphasize that the cuckoo clock as we know it today, comes from this region located in southwest [[Germany]] whose tradition of clockmaking started in the late 17th century. The Black Forest people who created the cuckoo clock industry developed it, and still come up with new designs and technical improvements which have made the cuckoo clock a valued work of art all over the world. The cuckoo clock history is linked to the Black Forest.

Even though the functionality of the cuckoo mechanism has remained basically unchanged, the appearance has changed as case designs and clock movements evolved in the region. The now traditional Black Forest clock design, the "Schilduhr" (Shield-clock), was characterized by having a painted flat square wooden face behind which all the clockwork was attached. On top of the square was usually a semicircle of highly decorated painted wood which contained the door for the cuckoo. These usually depicted floral patterns (so-called "Rosenuhren", rose clocks) and often had a painted column, on either side of the chapter ring, others were decorated with illustrations of fruit as well. Some pieces also bore the names of the bride and bridegroom on the dial, which were normally painted by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antique-horology.org/_Editorial/BlackForestClocks/default.htm |title=Pier Van Leeuwen,'&amp;#39; Clocks from the Black Forest (1740–1900)'&amp;#39; (2005): in the Museum of the Dutch Clock website |publisher=Antique-horology.org |date=2005-10-31 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no cabinet surrounding the clockwork in this model. This design was the most prevalent between the end of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. These timekeepers were typically sold from door to door by "Uhrenträger" (Clock-peddlers, literally "clock carriers") who would carry the dials and movements on their backs displayed on huge backpacks.

Towards the middle of the nineteenth century till the 1870s, cuckoo clocks were also manufactured in the Black Forest type of clock known as "Rahmenuhr" (Framed-clock). As the name suggests, these scarce wall cuckoo clocks consisted of a picture frame, usually with a typical Black Forest scene painted on a wooden background or a sheet metal, [[lithography]] and [[screen-printing]] were other techniques used. Other common themes depicted were; hunting, love, family, death, birth, mythology, military and Christian religious scenes. Works by painters such as Johann Baptist Laule (1817–1895) and Carl Heine (1842–1882) were used to decorate the fronts of this and other types of clocks. The painting was almost always protected by a glass and some models displayed a person or an animal with blinking or flirty eyes as well, being operated by a simple mechanism worked by means of the pendulum swinging. The cuckoo normally took part in the scene painted, and would pop out in 3D, as usual, to announce the hour.

From the 1860s until the early 20th, cases were manufactured in a rich variety of styles such as; Biedermeier (some models also included a painting of a person or animal with moving eyes), Neoclassical or Georgian (certain pieces also displayed a painting), Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Art Nouveau, etc., becoming a suitable complementary piece for the bourgeois living room. These timepieces, based both on architectural and home decorative styles, are rarer than the popular ones looking like gatekeeper-houses (Bahnhäusle style clocks) and they could be mantel, wall or bracket clocks.

But the popular house-shaped Bahnhäusleuhr (Railroad house clock) virtually forced the discontinuation of other designs within a few decades.

===Bahnhäusle style, a successful design from Furtwangen===
[[File:Eisenl2.png|thumb|right|150px|Left: Railway-house clock by Friedrich Eisenlohr, 1850–1851; right: Kreuzer, Glatz &amp; Co., Furtwangen, 1853–1854, without cuckoo bird (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 2003-081)]]

In September 1850, the first director of the Grand Duchy of Baden Clockmakers School in [[Furtwangen]], [[Robert Gerwig]], launched a public competition to submit designs for modern clockcases, which would allow homemade products to attain a professional appearance.

Friedrich Eisenlohr (1805–1854), who as an architect had been responsible for creating the buildings along the then new and first Badenese Rhine valley railway, submitted the most far-reaching design.&lt;ref&gt;The credit for first discovering Eisenlohr's original design goes to Herbert Jüttemann. See Herbert Jüttemann, ''Die Schwarzwalduhr'', 4th ed. (Karlsruhe, 2000): p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eisenlohr enhanced the facade of a standard railroad-guard's residence, as he had built many of them, with a clock dial. His ''"Wallclock with shield decorated by ivy vines,"'' (in reality the ornament were grapevines and not ivy) as it is referred to in a surviving, handwritten report from the Clockmakers School from 1851 or 1852, became the prototype of today's popular souvenir cuckoo clocks.

Eisenlohr was also up-to-date stylistically. He was inspired by local images; rather than copying them slavishly, he modified them. Contrary to most present-day cuckoo clocks, his case features light, unstained wood and were decorated with symmetrical, flat fretwork ornaments.

Eisenlohr's idea became an instant hit, because the modern design of the Bahnhäusle clock appealed to the decorating tastes of the growing bourgeoisie and thereby tapped into new and growing markets.

While the Clockmakers School was satisfied to have Eisenlohr's clock case sketches, they were not fully realized in their original form. Eisenlohr had proposed a wooden facade; Gerwig preferred a painted metal front combined with an enamel dial. But despite intensive campaigns by the Clockmakers School, sheet metal fronts decorated with oil paintings (or coloured lithographs) never became a major market segment because of the high cost and labour-intensive process,&lt;ref name="Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock. A Success Story'' p. 649."&gt;Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock. A Success Story''. In: NAWCC Bulletin, December 2006: p. 649.&lt;/ref&gt; hence only a few were produced (from the 1850s until around 1870), whether wall or mantel versions, and are nowadays sought-after collector pieces.

Characteristically, the makers of the first Bahnhäusle clocks deviated from Eisenlohr's sketch in only one way: they left out the cuckoo mechanism. Unlike today, the design with the little house was not synonymous with a cuckoo clock in the first years after 1850. This is another indication that at that time cuckoo clocks could not have been an important market segment.&lt;ref name="Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock. A Success Story'' p. 649."/&gt;

Only in December 1854, [[Johann Baptist Beha]], the best known maker of cuckoo clocks of his time, sold two of them, with oil paintings on their fronts, to the Furtwangen clock dealer Gordian Hettich, which were described as ''Bahnhöfle Uhren'' ("Railroad station clocks").&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Schneider "Frühe Kuckucksuhren von Johann Baptist Beha aus Eisenbach im Hochschwarzwald" (Remembering the design of a genius. 150 years of Bahnhaeusle clocks), ''Alte Uhren und moderne Zeitmessung'', No. 3 (1987): pp. 45–53, here p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; More than a year later, on January 20, 1856, another respected Furtwangen-based cuckoo clockmaker, [[Theodor Ketterer]], sold one to Joseph Ruff in [[Glasgow]] ([[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom]]).

Concurrently with Beha and Ketterer, other [[Black Forest]] clockmakers must have started to equip Bahnhäusle clocks with cuckoo mechanisms to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for this type of clock. Starting in the mid-1850s there was a real boom in this market.

By 1860, the Bahnhäusle style had started to develop away from its original, "severe" graphic form, and evolve, among other designs, toward the well-known case with three-dimensional woodcarvings, like the ''Jagdstück'' ("Hunt piece", design created in Furtwangen in 1861), a cuckoo clock with carved oak foliage and hunting motives, such as trophy animals, guns and powder pouches.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider 1987, p. 51. ''(Within a short time more orders for hunt pieces are recorded, specifically on October 30, November 7 and November 26, 1861.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1862 the reputed clockmaker Johann Baptist Beha, started to enhance his richly decorated Bahnhäusle clocks with hands carved from bone and weights cast in the shape of fir cones.&lt;ref&gt;As per Wilhelm Schneider, who had a chance to examine the account books of Beha. See Wilhelm Schneider, "Frühe Kuckucksuhren von Johann Baptist aus Eisenbach im Hochschwarzwald" (Early cuckoo clocks by Johann Baptist Beha of Eisenbach in the high Black Forest). ''Alte Uhren und moderne Zeitmessung''. No 3 (1987): pp. 45–53, here p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Even today this combination of elements is characteristic for cuckoo clocks, although the hands are usually made of wood or plastic, white celluloid was employed in the past too. As for the weights, there was during this second half of the 19th century, a few models which featured weights cast in the shape of a [[Gnome]] and other curious forms.

Only ten years after its invention by Friedrich Eisenlohr, all variations of the house-theme had reached maturity. There were also Bahnhäusle timepieces and its derived manufactured as mantel clocks but not as many as the wall versions.

The basic cuckoo clock of today is the railway-house (Bahnhäusle) form, still with its rich ornamentation, and these are known under the name of "traditional" (or carved); which display carved leaves, birds, deer heads (Jagdstück design), other animals, etc. The richly decorated Bahnhäusle clocks have become a symbol of the Black Forest that is instantly understood anywhere in the world.

The cuckoo clock became successful and world-famous after Friedrich Eisenlohr contributed the Bahnhäusle design to the 1850 competition at the Furtwangen Clockmakers School.&lt;ref name="Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock. A Success Story'' p. 651"/&gt;

==="Chalet" style, the Swiss contribution===
[[File:Swiss cuckoo clock, ca. 1900.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Swiss mantel cuckoo clock with case in the shape of a Brienz chalet. It is fitted with a music box with 8 melodies, ca. 1900.]]
The "Chalet" style originated at the end of the 19th century in Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=– 11:11 |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Going_cuckoo_about_real_Swiss_cuckoo_clocks.html?cid=681210 |title=Robert Brookes, '&amp;#39;Going cuckoo about real Swiss cuckoo clocks'&amp;#39; (2006): in |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=2006-11-24 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time they were highly valued as souvenirs. Indeed, music and jewellery boxes of several sizes as well as timepieces were manufactured in the shape of a typical Swiss chalet, some of those clocks had also the added feature of a cuckoo bird and other automata. In the English-speaking world, cuckoo clocks are sufficiently identified with Switzerland that the film [[The Third Man]] has a oft-quoted speech (and it even had [[The Third Man#.22Swiss cuckoo clock.22 speech|antecedents]]) in which the villainous Harry Lime mockingly says that "in Switzerland they had brotherly love. They had 500 years of democracy and peace. And what did that produce? The cuckoo clock."

There are three basic styles, named after the type of traditional house depicted: Black Forest chalet, Swiss chalet (with two types the "[[Brienz]]" and the "[[Emmental]]"), and finally the Bavarian chalet. The only genuine Swiss chalet cuckoo clock maker in existence today is Loetscher AG. 

Along with the common projecting bird, it may also display other types of animated figurines, examples include woodcutters, moving beer drinkers and turning water wheels. Some "traditional" style cuckoo clocks feature a music box and dancing figurines too.

===Designer cuckoo clocks: The stylistic revolution===
[[File:Cuckoo clock by Pascal Tarabay.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Designer]] cuckoo clock by Pascal Tarabay, 2005. It is based on the traditional Jagdstück (Hunt piece).]]

The early 21st century has seen a revitalization of this ancient icon with designs, materials, technologies, shapes and colors never seen before in cuckoo clock manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Juan F. Déniz, ''Designer Cuckoo Clocks'' p. 479."&gt;[http://nawcc.org/images/stories/publications/405_479_485n.pdf Juan F. Déniz, ''Designer Cuckoo Clocks''. In: NAWCC Bulletin, September/October 2013: p. 479.]&lt;/ref&gt;  These timekeepers are distinguished by its [[Form follows function|functional]], schematic and [[minimalism|minimalist]] aesthetic.

Although simplified [[design]]s with simple, clear lines had already been produced in the 20th century, the real boom of seeing the cuckoo clock as a designer item, where the [[creativity]] and talent of [[designer]]s are freely expressed and where the only limit seems to be [[imagination]], was initiated in the 2000s (the first examples dating back to the 1990s), particularly in Italy and Germany.&lt;ref name="Juan F. Déniz, ''Designer Cuckoo Clocks'' p. 479."/&gt;

As for the models, there are a great variety, many of them [[avant-garde]] and adventurous creations made of different materials and [[List of geometric shapes|geometric shapes]], such as rhombuses, squares, cubes, circles, rectangles, ovals, etc. Without carving, these clocks are usually flat and smooth. Some are painted in a single colour while others are polychromes with abstract or figurative paintings, multicolour lines and stripes, others include text and phrases, etc. About the clockwork, there are quartz, mechanical and sometimes, digital.

==Museums==
In Europe, museums that display collections are the [[Cuckooland Museum]] in the UK, and the [[Deutsches Uhrenmuseum]] and [[Dorf- und Uhrenmuseum Gütenbach]] in Germany. One of the biggest [[private collection]]s in the United States that are open to the public located in [[Minneapolis]]. It contains more than 300 cuckoo clocks.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Marsh.

'''''De Stijl''''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|_|ˈ|s|t|aɪ|l}}; {{IPA-nl|də ˈstɛil}}), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "The Style", also known as '''Neoplasticism''', was a Dutch [[art]]istic movement founded in 1917 in Leiden. De Stijl consisted of artists and architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linduff|first=David G. Wilkins, Bernard Schultz, Katheryn M.|title=Art past, art present|date=1994|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0-13-062084-X|pages=523|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a narrower sense, the term ''De Stijl'' is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/de-stijl |title=De Stijl |accessdate=2006-07-31 |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |type=Paperback |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of De Stijl advocated pure [[abstract art|abstraction]] and universality by a reduction to the essentials of [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]] and [[colour]]; they simplified visual compositions to vertical and horizontal, using only [[black]], [[white]] and [[primary color]]s.

''De Stijl'' is also the name of a journal that was published by the Dutch painter, designer, writer, and critic [[Theo van Doesburg]] that served to propagate the group's theories. Along with [[Theo van Doesburg]], the group's principal members were the painters [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Vilmos Huszár]], and [[Bart van der Leck]], and the architects [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff]], and [[Jacobus Oud|J. J. P. Oud]]. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as ''Neoplasticism''—the new plastic art (or ''Nieuwe Beelding'' in Dutch).

According to Theo van Doesburg in the introduction of the magazine "De Stijl" 1917 no.1, the "De Stijl"-movement was a reaction to the "Modern Baroque" of the [[Amsterdam School]] movement ([[Expressionist architecture|Dutch expressionist architecture]]) with the magazine "[[Wendingen]]" (1918-1931).

Mondrian sets forth the delimitations of Neoplasticism in his essay "Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art". He writes, "this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour". With these constraints, his art allows only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/n/neo-plasticism|title=Neo-plasticism – Art Term - Tate|first=|last=Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The De Stijl movement posited the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/movements/195212/description/|title=The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum-Guggenheim] Collection Online: De Stijl|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429120104/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/movements/195212/description|archivedate=2014-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name De Stijl is supposedly derived from [[Gottfried Semper]]'s ''Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Künsten oder Praktische Ästhetik'' (1861–3), which Curl&lt;ref name="archdic"/&gt; suggests was mistakenly believed to advocate [[materialism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. The "plastic vision" of De Stijl artists, also called Neo-Plasticism, saw itself as reaching beyond the changing appearance of natural things to bring an audience into intimate contact with an immutable core of reality, a reality that was not so much a visible fact as an underlying spiritual vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denker|first1=Susan A.|title=De Stijl: 1917–1931, Visions of Utopia|journal=Art Journal|date=September 1982|volume=42|issue=3|pages=242–246|doi=10.1080/00043249.1982.10792803|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00043249.1982.10792803}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, De Stijl proposed ultimate simplicity and abstraction, both in architecture and painting, by using only straight horizontal and vertical lines and rectangular forms. Furthermore, their formal vocabulary was limited to the primary colours, [[red]], [[yellow]], and [[blue]], and the three primary values, [[black]], [[white]], and [[grey]]. The works avoided symmetry and attained aesthetic balance by the use of opposition. This element of the movement embodies the second meaning of ''stijl'': "a post, jamb or support"; this is best exemplified by the construction of crossing joints, most commonly seen in [[carpentry]].

In many of the group's three-dimensional works, vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. This feature can be found in the [[Rietveld Schröder House]] and the [[Red and Blue Chair]].

De Stijl was influenced by [[Cubist]] painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about "ideal" geometric forms (such as the "perfect straight line") in the [[neoplatonic]] philosophy of mathematician [[M.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;J. Schoenmaekers]]. The De Stijl movement was also influenced by [[Neopositivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linduff|first=David G. Wilkins, Bernard Schultz, Katheryn M.|title=Art past, art present|date=1994|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0-13-062084-X|page=523|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of De Stijl would influence the [[Bauhaus]] style and the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an "-ism" (e.g., [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], [[Surrealism]]), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like the Bauhaus; it was a collective project, a joint enterprise.

In [[music]], De Stijl was an influence only on the work of composer [[Jakob van Domselaer]], a close friend of Mondrian. Between 1913 and 1916, he composed his ''Proeven van Stijlkunst'' ("Experiments in Artistic Style"), inspired mainly by Mondrian's paintings. This [[minimalist]]ic—and, at the time, revolutionary—music defined "horizontal" and "vertical" musical elements and aimed at balancing those two principles. Van Domselaer was relatively unknown in his lifetime, and did not play a significant role within De Stijl.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
From the flurry of new art movements that followed the [[Impressionist]] revolutionary new perception of painting, [[Cubism]] arose in the early 20th century as an important and influential new direction. In the [[Netherlands]], too, there was interest in this "new art".

However, because the Netherlands remained neutral in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], Dutch artists were not able to leave the country after 1914 and were thus effectively isolated from the international art world—and in particular, from [[Paris]], which was its centre then.

During that period, Theo van Doesburg started looking for other artists to set up a [[Literary magazine|journal]] and start an art movement. Van Doesburg was also a writer, poet, and critic, who had been more successful writing about art than working as an independent artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Theo van Doesburg|editor1-last=Translated by Janet Seligman|editor2-last=Introd. by Hans M. Wingler|editor3-last=Postscript by H.L.C. Jaffé|title=Grundbegriffe der Neuen Gestaltenden Kunst (Grondbeginselen der Nieuwe beeldende Kunst [Principles of Neo-Plastic Art])|date=1918|publisher=Lund Humphries (1968)|location=London, UK|isbn=0853311048|language=German, Dutch, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quite adept at making new contacts due to his flamboyant personality and outgoing nature, he had many useful connections in the art world.

=== Founding of ''De Stijl'' ===
[[File:Theo van Doesburg Composition VII (the three graces).jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Theo van Doesburg]], ''Composition VII (the three graces)'' 1917]]
[[File:Otterloo kroller muller mondrian composition couleur A.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Piet Mondrian]], ''Composition en couleur A'', 1917, [[Kröller-Müller Museum]]]]
Around 1915, [[Theo van Doesburg|Van Doesburg]] started meeting the artists who would eventually become the founders of the journal. He first met [[Piet Mondrian]] at an exhibition in [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]]. Mondrian, who had moved to Paris in 1912 (and there, changed his name from "Mondriaan"), had been visiting the Netherlands when war broke out. He could not return to Paris, and was staying in the artists' community of [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]], where he met [[Bart van der Leck]] and regularly saw [[M.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;J. Schoenmaekers]]. In 1915, Schoenmaekers published ''Het nieuwe wereldbeeld'' ("The New Image of the World"), followed in 1916 by ''Beginselen der beeldende wiskunde'' ("Principles of Plastic Mathematics"). These two publications would greatly influence Mondrian and other members of De Stijl.

Van Doesburg also knew [[J.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;P. Oud]] and the Hungarian artist [[Vilmos Huszár]]. In 1917 the cooperation of these artists, together with the poet [[Anthony Kok]], resulted in the founding of De Stijl. The young architect [[Gerrit Rietveld]] joined the group in 1918.  At its height De Stijl had 100 members and the journal had a circulation of 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dujardin|first1=Alain|last2=Quirindongo|first2=Jop|title=This 100-Year-Old Dutch Movement Shaped Web Design Today|url=https://backchannel.com/100-years-of-clean-lines-how-de-stijl-is-influencing-digital-design-4397f1a72e37?curator=MediaREDEF#.kphtjs1er|website=[[Backchannel (blog)]]|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During those first few years, the group was still relatively homogeneous, although Van der Leck left in 1918 due to artistic differences of opinion. [[Manifesto]]s were being published, signed by all members. The social and economic circumstances of the time formed an important source of inspiration for their theories, and their ideas about architecture were heavily influenced by [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Berlage]] and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].

The name ''Nieuwe Beelding'' was a term first coined in 1917 by Mondrian, who wrote a series of twelve articles called ''De Nieuwe Beelding in de schilderkunst'' ("Neo-Plasticism in Painting") that were published in the journal ''De Stijl''. In 1920 he published a book titled ''Le Néo-Plasticisme''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/mondrian1920/0005 Piet Mondrian, ''Le Néo-Plasticisme, Principe Général de l'Equivalence Plastique'', Paris, 1920], Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After 1920 ===
[[File:Van Doesburg and Rietveld interior 1919.jpg|thumb|Van Doesburg and Rietveld interior, c.1919, [[Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam]]
Around 1921, the group's character started to change. From the time of van Doesburg's association with [[Bauhaus]], other influences started playing a role. These influences were mainly [[Malevich]] and Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], to which not all members agreed. In 1924 Mondrian broke with the group after van Doesburg proposed the theory of elementarism, suggesting that a diagonal line is more vital than horizontal and vertical ones. In addition, the De Stijl group acquired many new "members". [[Dada]]ist influences, such as [[I.&amp;nbsp;K. Bonset]]'s poetry and [[Aldo Camini]]'s "antiphilosophy" generated controversy as well. Only after Van Doesburg's death was it revealed that Bonset and Camini were two of his pseudonyms.

=== After van Doesburg's death ===

Private courses, introduction of the Cubist architecture of "De Stijl", 1921-1922. Retrospective in Landesmuseum Weimar, 16 December 1923 - 23 January 1924]]
Theo van Doesburg died in [[Davos]], Switzerland, in 1931. His wife, Nelly, administered his estate.

Because of van Doesburg's pivotal role within De Stijl, the group did not survive. Individual members remained in contact, but De Stijl could not exist without a strong central character. Thus, it may be wrong to think of De Stijl as a close-knit group of artists. The members knew each other, but most communication took place by letter. For example, Mondrian and Rietveld never met in person.

Many, though not all, artists did stay true to the movement's basic ideas, even after 1931. Rietveld, for instance, continued designing furniture according to De Stijl principles, while Mondrian continued working in the style he had initiated around 1920. Van der Leck, on the other hand, went back to figurative compositions after his departure from the group.

=== Influence on architecture ===
The De Stijl influence on architecture remained considerable long after its inception; [[Mies van der Rohe]] was among the most important proponents of its ideas. Between 1923 and 1924, [[Gerrit Rietveld|Rietveld]] designed the Rietveld Schröder House, the only building to have been created completely according to De Stijl principles. Examples of Stijl-influenced works by [[J.J.P. Oud]] can be found in [[Rotterdam]] (''{{Ill|Café De Unie|nl}}'') and [[Hoek van Holland]]. Other examples include the [[Eames House]] by Charles and Ray Eames, and the interior decoration for the [[Aubette (building)|Aubette dance hall]] in Strasbourg, designed by Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Jean Arp and van Doesburg.

=== Present day ===
Works by De Stijl members are scattered all over the world, but De Stijl-themed exhibitions are organised regularly. Museums with large De Stijl collections include the [[Gemeentemuseum Den Haag|Gemeentemuseum]] in [[The Hague]] (which owns the world's most extensive, although not exclusively De Stijl-related, Mondrian collection) and [[Amsterdam]]'s [[Stedelijk Museum]], where many works by Rietveld and Van Doesburg are on display. The [[{{Not a typo|Centraal}} Museum]] of [[Utrecht]] has the largest Rietveld collection worldwide; it also owns the Rietveld Schröder House, Rietveld's adjacent "show house", and the Rietveld Schröder Archives.

The movement inspired the design aesthetics of [[Rumyantsevo (Moscow Metro)|Rumyantsevo]] and [[Salaryevo]] stations of [[Moscow Metro]] opened in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/marble-and-mondrian-a-tour-of-moscows-metro/g-19098971|title=Marble and Mondrian: a tour of Moscow metro|publisher=DW|accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlebedev.com/metro/rumyantsevo/|title=Type design for Rumyantsevo Moscow Metro station|accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Decimal_Time_Clock.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Decimal Time clock reading 2.50 DT equivalent to 6 AM standard time]]
'''Decimal time''' is the representation of the time of day using units which are [[decimal]]ly related. This term is often used specifically to refer to [[#France|French Revolutionary Time]], used in France for a few years beginning in 1792 during the [[French Revolution]], which divided the day into 10 decimal hours, each decimal hour into 100 decimal minutes and each decimal minute into 100 decimal seconds, as opposed to the more familiar [[UTC]] [[Time standard]], which divides the day into 24 [[hour]]s, each hour into 60 [[minute]]s and each minute into 60 [[second]]s.

The main advantage of a decimal time system is that, since the [[radix|base]] used to divide the time is the same as the one used to represent it, the whole time representation can be handled as a single string. Therefore, it becomes simpler to interpret a timestamp and to perform conversions. For instance, 1:23:00 is 1 decimal hour and 23 decimal minutes, or 1.23 hours, or 123 minutes; 3 hours is 300 minutes or 30,000 seconds.
This property also makes it straightforward to represent a timestamp as a [[#Fractional days|fractional day]], so that {{#time:Y-m-d}}.534 can be interpreted as five decimal hours and 34 decimal minutes after the start of that day, or 0.534 (53.4%) of a day through that day. It also adjusts well to digital time representation using [[Epoch (computing)|epochs]], in that the internal time representation can be used directly both for computation and for user-facing display.

==History==

===China===
{{Main article|Traditional Chinese timekeeping}}

Decimal time was used in China throughout most of its history alongside [[duodecimal]] time. The midnight-to-midnight day was divided both into 12 double hours ({{zh|t={{linktext|時辰}}|s={{linktext|时辰}}|p=shí chén|first=t}}) and also into 10 shi / 100 ''ke'' ({{zh|t={{linktext|刻}}|p=kè}}) by the 1st millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nachum Dershowitz]], [[Edward M.

Several of the roughly 50 Chinese calendars also divided each ''ke'' into 100 ''fen'', although others divided each ''ke'' into 60 ''fen''. In 1280, the ''Shoushi'' (Season Granting) calendar further subdivided each ''fen'' into 100 ''miao'', creating a complete decimal time system of 100 ''ke'', 100 ''fen'' and 100 ''miao''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Martzloff, "Chinese mathematical astronomy", in [[Helaine Selin]], ed., ''Mathematics across cultures'' (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 2000) 373–407, p.393, {{ISBN|0-7923-6481-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese decimal time ceased to be used in 1645 when the ''Shixian'' (Constant Conformity) calendar, based on European astronomy and brought to China by the [[Jesuit]]s, adopted 96 ''ke'' per day alongside 12 double hours, making each ''ke'' exactly one-quarter hour.&lt;ref&gt;K.

In 1754, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] wrote in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'':
:It would be very desirable that all divisions, for example of the ''livre'', the ''sou'', the ''toise'', the day, the hour, etc. would be from tens into tens. This division would result in much easier and more convenient calculations and would be very preferable to the arbitrary division of the ''livre'' into twenty ''sous'', of the ''sou'' into twelve ''deniers'', of the day into twenty-four hours, the hour into sixty minutes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1788, [[Claude Boniface Collignon]] proposed dividing the day into 10 hours or 1000 minutes, each new hour into 100 minutes, each new minute into 1000 seconds, and each new second into 1000 ''tierces'' (Latin for "third"). The distance the [[terminator (solar)|twilight zone]] travels in one such ''tierce'' at the [[equator]], which would be one-billionth of the [[circumference]] of the [[earth]], would be a new unit of length, provisionally called a half-[[palm (unit)|handbreadth]], equal to four modern [[centimetre]]s. Further, the new ''tierce'' would be divided into 1000 ''quatierces'', which he called "microscopic points of time". He also suggested a week of 10 days and dividing the year into 10 "solar months".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Decimal time was officially introduced during the [[French Revolution]]. [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] made a proposal for decimal time on November 5, 1792. The [[National Convention]] issued a decree on 5 October 1793:

:''XI. Le jour, de minuit à minuit, est divisé en dix parties, chaque partie en dix autres, ainsi de suite jusqu’à la plus petite portion commensurable de la durée.''

:XI. The day, from midnight to midnight, is divided into ten parts, each part into ten others, and so forth until the smallest measurable portion of duration.

These parts were named on 24 November 1793 (4 [[Frimaire]] of the Year II). The primary divisions were called hours, and they added:

:''La centième partie de l'heure est appelée ''minute décimale''; la centième partie de la minute est appelée ''seconde décimale''. ''(emphasis in original)

:The hundredth part of the hour is called ''decimal minute''; the hundredth part of the minute is called ''decimal second''.

Thus, midnight was called either ''dix heures'' (10 o'clock) or ''zero heures''&lt;span&gt; (0 o'clock)&lt;/span&gt;, noon was called ''cinq heures'' (5 o'clock), etc. Units were either written out or abbreviated, such as 8 h. 72 m. Sometimes in official records, decimal hours were divided into tenths, or ''décimes'', instead of minutes.&lt;ref name="Shaw2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Shaw|title=Time and the French Revolution: The Republican Calendar, 1789-year XIV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7fEHa7eHYEC|year=2011|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-0-86193-311-2|pages=132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Decimal Time: Unlike the metric system of measurements, decimal time did not survive the French Revolution.

Thus, although decimal time is sometimes referred to as [[metric time]], the metric system at first had no time unit, and later versions of the metric system used the second, equal to 1/86400 day, as the metric time unit. In spite of this, decimal time was used in many cities, including [[Marseille]] and [[Toulouse]], where a decimal clock with just an hour hand was on the front of the [[Capitole de Toulouse|Capitole]] for five years.&lt;ref name="Shaw2011" /&gt; On the [[Tuileries Palace|Palace of the Tuileries]] in [[Paris]], two of the four clock faces displayed decimal time until at least 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematician and astronomer [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] had a decimal watch made for him, and used decimal time in his work, in the form of [[#Fractional days|fractional days]]. Because of this, astronomers still use decimal time.

Decimal time was part of a larger attempt at [[decimal]]isation in revolutionary France (which also included [[decimalisation]] of currency and [[metrication]]) and was introduced as part of the [[French Republican Calendar]], which, in addition to decimally dividing the day, divided the month into three ''décades'' of 10 days each; this calendar was abolished at the end of 1805. The start of each year was determined according to the day of the [[autumnal equinox]], in relation to true or [[apparent solar time]] at the [[Paris Observatory]]. Decimal time would also have been reckoned according to apparent solar time, depending on the location it was observed, as was already the practice generally for the setting of clocks. {{#time:H}}:{{#time:i}}:{{#time:s}} GMT is

decimal time in Paris.

At the [[International Meridian Conference]] of 1884, the following resolution was proposed by the French delegation and passed [[nem con]] (with 3 abstentions):
:VII. That the Conference expresses the hope that the technical studies designed to regulate and extend the application of the decimal system to the division of angular space and of time shall be resumed, so as to permit the extension of this application to all cases in which it presents real advantages.

In the 1890s, Joseph Charles François de Rey-Pailhade, president of the Toulouse Geographical Society, proposed dividing the day into 100 parts, called ''cés'', equal to 14.4 standard minutes, and each divided into 10 ''decicés'', 100 ''centicés'', etc. The Toulouse Chamber of Commerce adopted a resolution supporting his proposal in April 1897. Although widely published, the proposal received little backing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French made another attempt at the decimalization of time in 1897, when the ''Commission de décimalisation du temps'' was created by the [[Bureau des Longitudes]], with the mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]] as secretary. The commission adopted a compromise, originally proposed by Henri de Sarrauton of the Oran Geographical Society, of retaining the 24-hour day, but dividing each hour into 100 decimal minutes, and each minute into 100 seconds. The plan did not gain acceptance and was abandoned in 1900.

===Switzerland===
{{main article|Swatch Internet Time}}
On 23 October 1998, the [[Swiss Made#Swiss watch|Swiss watch]] company [[Swatch]] introduced a decimal time called [[Swatch Internet Time|Internet Time]], which divides the day into 1,000 decimal minutes (Swatch called them ''.beats''), (each 86.4 seconds in standard time) counted from 000–999, with @000 being midnight and @500 being noon [[standard time]] in [[Switzerland]], which is [[Central European Time]] (one hour ahead of [[Universal Time]]). A line painted on Swatch headquarters in the Swiss city of Biel (now [[Biel/Bienne]]) was declared to mark the Biel Meridian, and Central European Time was relabelled as "Biel Meantime" (BMT), even though it does not correspond to actual [[local mean time]] in Biel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swatch.com/en_us/internet-time#main|title=Internet Time - Swatch® United States|author=|date=|website=www.swatch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversions==
There are exactly 86,400 standard seconds (see [[SI]] for the current definition of the standard second) in a standard day, but in the French decimal time system there were 100,000 decimal seconds in the day, so the decimal second was shorter than its counterpart.

==Decimal hours==
Another common type of decimal time is decimal hours. In 1896, Henri de Sarrauton of the Oran Geographical Society proposed dividing the 24 hours of the day each into 100 decimal minutes, and each minute into 100 decimal seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Sarrauton, Henri de (1896). ''L'Heure décimale et la division de la circonférence'', Oran: Fouque&lt;/ref&gt; Although endorsed by the Bureau des Longitudes, this proposal failed, but using decimal fractions of an hour to represent the time of day instead of minutes has become common.

Decimal hours are frequently used in accounting for payrolls and hourly billing. [[Time clock]]s typically record the time of day in tenths or hundredths of an hour.  For instance, 8:30 am would be recorded as 08.50. This is intended to make accounting easier by eliminating the need to convert between minutes and hours.

For aviation purposes, where it is common to add times in an already complicated environment, time tracking is simplified by recording decimal fractions of hours. For instance, instead of adding 1:36 to 2:36, getting 3:72 and converting it to 4:12, one would add 1.6 to 2.6 and get 4.2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.casa.gov.au/scripts/nc.dll?WCMS:STANDARD::pc=PC_90100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fractional days==
The time of day is sometimes represented as a decimal fraction of a day in science and computers. Standard 24-hour time is converted into a fractional day by dividing the number of hours elapsed since midnight by 24 to make a [[Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]]. Thus, midnight is 0.0 day, noon is 0.5 d, etc., which can be added to any type of date, including (all of which refer to the same moment):
* [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian dates]]: 2000 January 1.5
* [[Two-line element set|Two-line elements]]: 00001.50000000
* [[Julian day|Julian dates]]: 2451545.0
* [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] serial dates: 36526.5

As many decimal places may be used as required for precision, so 0.5 d = 0.500000 d. Fractional days are often calculated in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] or [[Terrestrial Time|TT]], although Julian Dates use pre-1925 astronomical date/time (each date began at noon = ".0") and [[Microsoft Excel]] uses the local time zone of the computer. Using fractional days reduces the number of units in time calculations from four (days, hours, minutes, seconds) to just one (days).

Fractional days are often used by [[astronomer]]s to record observations, and were expressed in relation to Paris Mean Time by the 18th century French mathematician and astronomer [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], as in these examples:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA348 | title=Traité de Mécanique Céleste}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre-Simon Laplace | Traité de Mécanique Céleste}}

Fractional days have been used by astronomers ever since. For instance, the 19th century British astronomer [[John Herschel]] gave these examples:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&amp;O=NUMM-94926 | title=Outlines of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Herschel | Outlines of Astronomy}}

Fractional days are commonly used to express [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]s of [[orbital elements]].  The decimal fraction is usually added to the calendar date or [[Julian day]] for natural objects, or to the [[ordinal date]] for artificial satellites in [[Two-line element set|two-line elements]].

==Decimal multiples and fractions of the second==
The second is the [[International System of Units|International System of Units (SI)]] unit of time duration. It is also the standard single-unit time representation in many programming languages, most notably C, and part of UNIX/POSIX standards used by Linux, Mac OS X, etc.; to convert fractional days to fractional seconds, multiply the number by 86400. Fractional seconds are represented as [[millisecond]]s (ms), [[microsecond]]s (μs) or [[nanosecond]]s (ns). Absolute times are usually represented relative to 1 January 1970, at midnight. Other systems may use a different zero point (a.k.a. [[Unix time|Epoch]]).

In principle, time spans greater than one second are given in units such as [[kilosecond]]s (ks), [[Myria-|myriasecond]] (mys), [[megasecond]]s (Ms), [[gigasecond]]s (Gs), [[terasecond and longer|and so on]]. (The myriasecond is based on the ''[[myria-]]'' prefix, which represented a multiple of 10000 but was made obsolete in the mid-20th century.) Occasionally, these units can be found in technical literature, but traditional units like minutes, hours, days and years are much more common, and are accepted for use with SI.

It is possible to specify the time of day as the number of kiloseconds or myriaseconds elapsed since midnight. Thus, instead of saying 3:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. one could say (time of day) 56.7 ks. There are exactly 86.4 ks or 8.64 mys in one day. However, this nomenclature is rarely used in practice.

==Scientific decimal time==
Scientists often record (rather than observe) time as decimals. For example, decimal days divides the day into 10 equal parts, and decimal years divides the year into 10 equal parts. Decimals are easier to plot than both (a) minutes and seconds, which uses the [[Sexagesimal]] numbering system, (b) hours, months and days, which has irregular month lengths. In astronomy, the so-called [[Julian day]] uses decimal days centered on noon.
;Seconds in a decimal minute

These values, based on the Julian year, are most likely to be those used in astronomy and related sciences. A [[Gregorian year]], which takes into account the 100/400 leap year rules of the [[Gregorian calendar]], is 365.2425 days (the average length of a year over a 400-year cycle), resulting in 0.1 years being a period of 36.52425 days (3155695.2 seconds; 36 days, 12 hours, 34 minutes, 55.2 seconds).

==Other decimal times==
Numerous individuals have proposed variations of decimal time, dividing the day into different numbers of units and subunits with different names. Most are based upon fractional days, so that one decimal time format may be easily converted into another, such that all the following are equivalent:

* 0.500 fractional day
* 5h 0m French decimal time
* @500.beats [[Swatch Internet Time]] (see below)
* 50.0 ''kes'' or ''cés'' (centidays)
* 500 millidays
* 50.0% time as a percentage
* 12:00 standard time

Some decimal time proposals are based upon alternate units of metric time. The difference between metric time and decimal time is that metric time defines units for measuring [[Interval (time)|time interval]], as measured with a [[stopwatch]], and decimal time defines the time of day, as measured by a clock. Just as standard time uses the metric time unit of the second as its basis, proposed decimal time scales may use alternative metric units.

{{Psychology sidebar}}

In the field of [[psychology]], the '''Dunning–Kruger effect''' is a [[cognitive bias]] in which people of low ability have [[illusory superiority]] and mistakenly assess their [[cognition|cognitive ability]] as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority comes from the inability of low-ability people to recognize their lack of ability. Without the [[self-awareness]] of [[metacognition]], low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.&lt;ref name="Kruger"/&gt;

As described by social psychologists [[David Dunning]] and [[Justin Kruger]], the cognitive bias of illusory superiority results from an internal illusion in people of low ability and from an external misperception in people of high ability; that is, "the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others."&lt;ref name="Kruger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kruger|first=Justin|author-link=Justin Kruger|last2=Dunning|first2=David|author2-link=David Dunning|date=1999|title=Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|volume=77|issue=6|pages=1121–1134|citeseerx=10.1.1.64.2655|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121|pmid=10626367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original study==
The psychological phenomenon of illusory superiority was identified as a form of cognitive bias in Kruger and Dunning's 1999 study "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments".&lt;ref name="Kruger" /&gt; The identification derived from the cognitive bias evident in the criminal case of McArthur Wheeler, who robbed banks with his face covered with lemon juice, which he believed would make it invisible to the surveillance cameras. This belief was based on his misunderstanding of the chemical properties of lemon juice as an [[invisible ink]].&lt;ref name="post2010"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2010/05/23/why-losers-have-delusions-of-grandeur/|title=Why losers have delusions of grandeur|date=23 May 2010|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other investigations of the phenomenon, such as "Why People Fail to Recognize Their Own Incompetence" (2003), indicate that much incorrect self-assessment of competence derives from the person's ignorance of a given activity's standards of performance.&lt;ref name=psymq&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunning|first=David|author-link=David Dunning|last2=Johnson|first2=Kerri|last3=Ehrlinger|first3=Joyce|last4=Kruger|first4=Justin|author4-link=Justin Kruger|date=1 June 2003|title=Why People Fail to Recognize Their Own Incompetence|journal=[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=83–87|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunning and Kruger's research also indicates that training in a task, such as solving a logic puzzle, increases people's ability to accurately evaluate how good they are at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/11/revisiting-why-incompetents-think-theyre-awesome/|title=Revisiting why incompetents think they’re awesome|last=Lee|first=Chris|date=5 November 2016|work=[[Ars Technica]]|page=3|accessdate=11 January 2014|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Self-insight: Roadblocks and Detours on the Path to Knowing Thyself'' (2005), Dunning described the Dunning–Kruger effect as "the [[anosognosia]] of everyday life", referring to a neurological condition in which a disabled person either denies or seems unaware of his or her disability. He stated: "If you're incompetent, you can't know you're incompetent&amp;nbsp;... The skills you need to produce a right answer are exactly the skills you need to recognize what a right answer is."&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/the-anosognosics-dilemma-1/|title=The Anosognosic's Dilemma: Something's Wrong but You'll Never Know What It Is (Part 1)|last=Morris|first=Errol|author-link=Errol Morris|date=20 June 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="selfinsight"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56066405|title=Self-insight: Roadblocks and Detours on the Path to Knowing Thyself|last=Dunning|first=David|author-link=David Dunning|date=2005|pages=14–15|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=1841690740|location=New York|oclc=56066405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later studies==
Dunning and Kruger tested the hypotheses of the cognitive bias of illusory superiority on undergraduate students of introductory courses in psychology by examining the students' self-assessments of their intellectual skills in [[logical reasoning]] ([[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], [[deductive]], [[abductive]]), English grammar, and personal sense of humor. After learning their self-assessment scores, the students were asked to estimate their ranks in the psychology class. The competent students underestimated their class rank, and the incompetent students overestimated theirs, but the incompetent students did not estimate their class rank as higher than the ranks estimated by the competent group. Across four studies, the research indicated that the study participants who scored in the bottom quartile on tests of their sense of humor, knowledge of grammar, and logical reasoning overestimated their test performance and their abilities; despite test scores that placed them in the 12th percentile, the participants estimated they ranked in the 62nd percentile.&lt;ref name="Kruger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2010/07/07/What-the-Dunning-Kruger-effect-Is-and-Isnt/|title=What the Dunning-Kruger effect Is and Isn't|last=Yarkoni|first=Tal|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, competent students tended to underestimate their own competence, because they erroneously presumed that tasks easy for them to perform were also easy for other people to perform. Incompetent students improved their ability to correctly estimate their class rank after receiving minimal tutoring in the skills they previously lacked, regardless of any objective improvement gained in said skills of perception.&lt;ref name="Kruger"/&gt; The study ''Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-estimated Ability'' (2004) extended the cognitive-bias premise of [[illusory superiority]] to test the subjects' emotional sensitivity toward other people and their perceptions of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ames|first=Daniel R.|last2=Kammrath|first2=Lara K.|date=September 2004|title=Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-Estimated Ability|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~da358/publications/ames_kammrath_mindreading.pdf|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=187–209|doi=10.1023/b:jonb.0000039649.20015.0e|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''How Chronic Self-Views Influence (and Potentially Mislead) Estimates of Performance'' (2003) indicated a shift in the participants' view of themselves when influenced by external cues. The participants' knowledge of geography was tested; some tests were intended to positively affect the participant's self-view and some were intended to affect it negatively. The participants then were asked to rate their performances; the participants given tests with a positive intent reported better performance than did the participants given tests with a negative intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ehrlinger|first=Joyce|last2=Dunning|first2=David|author2-link=David Dunning|title=How chronic self-views influence (and potentially mislead) estimates of performance.|date=January 2003|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|publisher=American Psychological Association|volume=84|issue=1|pages=5–17|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.1.5|pmid=12518967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To test Dunning and Kruger's hypotheses, "that people, at all performance levels, are equally poor at estimating their relative performance", the study ''Skilled or Unskilled, but Still Unaware of It: How Perceptions of Difficulty Drive Miscalibration in Relative Comparisons'' (2006) investigated three studies that manipulated the "perceived difficulty of the tasks, and, hence, [the] participants' beliefs about their relative standing". The investigation indicated that when the experimental subjects were presented with moderately difficult tasks, there was little variation among the best performers and the worst performers in their ability to accurately predict their performance. With more difficult tasks, the best performers were less accurate in predicting their performance than were the worst performers. Therefore, judges at all levels of skill are subject to similar degrees of error in the performance of tasks.&lt;ref name="Burson2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burson|first=Katherine A.|last2=Larrick|first2=Richard P.|last3=Klayman|first3=Joshua|title=Skilled or unskilled, but still unaware of it: How perceptions of difficulty drive miscalibration in relative comparisons.|date=2006|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|volume=90|issue=1|pages=60–77|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.1.60|pmid=16448310|hdl=2027.42/39168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In testing alternative explanations for the cognitive bias of illusory superiority, the study ''Why the Unskilled are Unaware: Further Explorations of (Absent) Self-insight Among the Incompetent ''(2008) reached the same conclusions as previous studies of the Dunning–Kruger effect: that, in contrast to high performers, "poor performers do not learn from feedback suggesting a need to improve".&lt;ref name="unskilledunaware"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrlinger|first=Joyce|last2=Johnson|first2=Kerri|last3=Banner|first3=Matthew|last4=Dunning|first4=David|author4-link=David Dunning|last5=Kruger|first5=Justin|author5-link=Justin Kruger|title=Why the unskilled are unaware: Further explorations of (absent) self-insight among the incompetent|year=2008|journal=[[Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes]]|volume=105|issue=1|pages=98–121|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2007.05.002|pmc=2702783|pmid=19568317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying issues of ''Numeracy'' ==
Two unique papers in ''[[National Numeracy Network|Numeracy]]'' reveal problems with the graphic introduced in the 1999 Kruger and Dunning paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nuhfer|first=Edward|last2=(retired)|first2=California State University|last3=Cogan|first3=Christopher|last4=Fleischer|first4=Steven|last5=Gaze|first5=Eric|last6=Wirth|first6=Karl|last7=Consultant|first7=Independent|last8=Islands|first8=California State University - Channel|last9=College|first9=Bowdoin|date=2016|title=Random Number Simulations Reveal How Random Noise Affects the Measurements and Graphical Portrayals of Self-Assessed Competency|journal=Numeracy|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.5038/1936-4660.9.1.4|issn=1936-4660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nuhfer|first=Edward|last2=(retired)|first2=California State University|last3=Fleischer|first3=Steven|last4=Cogan|first4=Christopher|last5=Wirth|first5=Karl|last6=Gaze|first6=Eric|last7=Islands|first7=California State University - Channel|last8=College|first8=Ventura|last9=College|first9=Macalester|date=2017|title=How Random Noise and a Graphical Convention Subverted Behavioral Scientists' Explanations of Self-Assessment Data: Numeracy Underlies Better Alternatives|journal=Numeracy|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.5038/1936-4660.10.1.4|issn=1936-4660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent researchers used it, (''y'' − ''x'') ''versus'' (''x'') scatter plots, and related variants for nearly two decades. The authors show how a major part of the body of literature that used these approaches seem to have mistaken and interpreted mathematical artifacts as the products of human behavior. The two papers employed paired, well-aligned instruments of known reliability to examine the evaluation of self-assessment measures from the perspective of signal and noise. They show how the mathematical problems inherent in the Kruger–Dunning type graph can be overcome by other kinds of graphing that attenuate noise or employ categorical data from known novices and experts. When artifacts are eliminated, the evidence is strong that humans are generally correct in their self-assessments, with only a small percentage of the participants who were studied exhibiting performance that might merit the label "unskilled and unaware of it". The authors' findings refute the claim that humans, in general, are prone to having greatly inflated views of their abilities, but they support two other tenets of the original Kruger and Dunning research: (1) that self-assessment skill can be learned and (2) experts usually self-assess themselves with better accuracy than do novices. The researchers noted that metacognitive self-assessment skill is of great value, and that it can be taught together with any disciplinary content in college courses.

==Cultural differences in self-perception==
Studies of the Dunning–Kruger effect usually have been of North Americans, but studies of Japanese people suggest that cultural forces have a role in the occurrence of the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb03/overestimate.aspx|title=Why We overestimate Our Competence|last=DeAngelis|first=Tori|date=February 2003|journal=Monitor on Psychology|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|volume=34|issue=2|page=60|issn=1529-4978|access-date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study ''Divergent Consequences of Success and Failure in Japan and North America: An Investigation of Self-improving Motivations and Malleable Selves'' (2001) indicated that Japanese people tended to underestimate their abilities, and tended to see underachievement (failure) as an opportunity to improve their abilities at a given task, thereby increasing their value to the social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heine|first=S.

==Historical antecedents==
Although the Dunning–Kruger effect was formulated in 1999, the [[cognitive bias]] of [[illusory superiority]] has been known throughout history and identified by [[intellectual]]s, such as: 
*the philosopher [[Confucius]] (551–479 BC), who said, "Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance"&lt;ref name=psymq/&gt; 
*the philosopher [[Socrates]] (470–399 BC), who interpreted a prophecy from the [[Pythia|Delphic oracle]] that he was wise despite feeling that he did not fully understand anything, as the wisdom of [[I know that I know nothing|being aware that he knew nothing]]
*the playwright [[William Shakespeare]] (1564–1616), who said, "The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool" (''[[As You Like It]]'', V.&amp;nbsp;i.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuller|first=Geraint|date=2011|title=Ignorant of ignorance?|journal=[[Practical Neurology]]|volume=11|issue=6|pages=365–365|doi=10.1136/practneurol-2011-000117|issn=1474-7758|pmid=22100949}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*the poet [[Alexander Pope]] (1688–1744), who wrote in ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', 1709: "A little learning is a dangerous thing"
*the novelist [[Henry Fielding]] (1707–1754), who, in the novel ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'', wrote: "For men of true learning, and almost universal knowledge, always compassionate [pity] the ignorance of others; but fellows who excel in some little, low, contemptible art, are always certain to despise those who are unacquainted with that art."
*the naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), who said, "Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge"&lt;ref name="Kruger"/&gt;
*the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900), who wrote in ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (aphorism 483), "The Enemies of Truth. — Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |translator-last=Zimmern |translator-first=Helen |date=1910 |title=Human, All Too Human |url=http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/main/b20790001_v_1_B000773557.pdf |location=Edinburgh |publisher=T. N. FOULIS |page=355 |isbn=978-1591026785 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the poet [[W. B. Yeats]] (1865–1939), who, in the poem ''[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]'', said: "The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity."&lt;ref name=unskilledunaware/&gt;
*the philosopher and mathematician [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970), who said, "One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision."&lt;ref name=unskilledunaware/&gt;

'''Economic, social and cultural rights''' are [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] [[human rights]], such as the [[right to education]], [[right to housing]], [[right to adequate standard of living]], [[right to health]], [[victims' rights]] and the [[right to science and culture]]. Economic, social and cultural rights are recognised and protected in international and regional human rights instruments. Member states have a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil economic, social and cultural rights and are expected to take "progressive action" towards their fulfilment.

The [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]] recognises a number of economic, social and cultural rights and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) is the primary international legal source of economic, social and cultural rights. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] recognises and protects many of the economic, social and cultural rights recognised in the ICESCR in relation to children and women. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin in relation to a number of economic, social and cultural rights. The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] also prohibits all discrimination on the basis of the disability including refusal of the [[reasonable accommodation]] relating to full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.

== International and regional human rights instruments ==
Economic, social and cultural rights are recognized and protected in a number of international and regional human rights instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International human rights instruments ===
The [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]] (UDHR), adopted by the [[UN General Assembly]] in 1948, is one of the most important sources of economic, social and cultural rights. It recognizes the [[right to social security]] in Article 22, the [[right to work]] in Article 23, the [[right to rest and leisure]] in Article 24, the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] in Article 25, the [[right to education]] in Article 26, and the [[right to benefits of science and culture]] in Article 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) is the primary international legal source of economic, social and cultural rights. The Covenant recognized and protects the [[right to work]] and to just and favorable working conditions in Article 6 and 7, the right to join [[trade unions]] and take collective labor action in Article 8, the [[right to social security]] in Article 9, the right to protection of the family, including protection for mothers and children, in Article 10, the [[right to an adequate standard of living]], including the [[right to food]] and the [[right to housing]], in Article 11, the [[right to health]] in Article 12, the [[right to education]] in Article 13, as well as the right to participate in cultural life and  the [[right to benefits of science and culture]] in Article 15. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], adopted at the same time as the ICESCR, recognizes and protects a number of core economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to join [[trade unions]] in Article 22, and the right of ethnic, religious or linguistic [[minority group|minorities]] to engage in their culture, practice their religion and use their language in Article 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other major international human rights instruments contain provisions relating to economic, social and cultural rights. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] recognizes and protects many of the economic, social and cultural rights recognized in the ICESCR in relation to children. Including the [[right to health]] in Article 24, the [[right to social security]] in Article 25, the right to an adequate standard of living in Article 27, the [[right to education]] in Article 28, and the right to protection from economic exploitation (see [[child labour]]) in Article 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin in relation to a number of economic, social and cultural rights. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] affirms a range of economic, social and cultural rights to women. The [[ILO Conventions]] of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) protect a range of work related economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional human rights instruments ===
The [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] protects the [[right to work]] in Article 15, the [[right to health]] in Article 16, and the [[right to education]] in Article 17. The [[European Social Charter]] protects a wide range of economic, social and cultural rights, including the [[right to work]], to favourable working conditions, the right to join [[trade unions]] and to take collective labour action in Article 1 to 10, the [[right to health]] in Article 11, the [[right to social security]], including the right to medical assistance and the right to social welfare services, in Article 12 to 14, protection of especially [[social vulnerability|vulnerable groups]] are enshrined in Article 15 to 17 and 19, and [[right to housing]] in Article 31. The [[Protocol of San Salvador]] protects a range of economic, social and cultural rights within the Inter-American human rights system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secondary legal sources ==
A range of secondary legal sources exist on economic, social and cultural rights which provide guidance on their normative definition. An important secondary legal source is the [[United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] which is overseeing the implementation of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR). The Committee has been central in developing the normative definition of key economic, social and cultural rights, interpreting the role of State Parties to the ICESCR, and monitoring protection and violation of the ICESCR rights. The Committee issues guiding pronouncements in the form of ''general comments'', and other human rights treaty bodies may also issue comments relevant to economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important secondary legal sources on economic, social and cultural rights are the [[Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] 1987 and the [[Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] 1997. The Limburg Principles have been extensively used in national legal systems as an interpretive tool for establishing violations of economic, social and cultural rights. The Maastricht Guidelines build on the Limburg Principles and identify the legal implications of acts and omissions which are violations of economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xv-xvi | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs]] have influenced the normative development of economic, social and cultural rights. Appointed by the [[Commission on Human Rights]] and its sub-commissions, key rapporteurs include the Special Rapporteur on the Realization of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, and the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xvi | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National constitutions ==
A number of national constitutions recognize economic, social and cultural rights. For example, the 1996 [[Constitution of South Africa]]  includes economic, social and cultural rights and the [[South African Constitutional Court]] has heard claims under these obligations (see ''[[Grootboom]]'' and ''[[Treatment Action Campaign]]'' cases). [[India's constitution]], which does not explicitly recognize economic and social rights in their constitution, has nonetheless found that these rights exist, though [[unenumerated rights|unenumerated]], inferable from the right to life. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

== State responsibility ==
Economic, social and cultural right enshrined in international and regional human rights instruments are legally binding. Member states have a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil these rights. The exact nature of states' obligations in this respect has been established principally in relation to the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xvi | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] has been established in accordance with [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], Part II paragraph 75&lt;/ref&gt;

State parties to the ICESCR are required to take "progressive action" towards fulfilment of the ICESR rights. While immediate fulfilment may not be possible due to the economic situation of a country, postponement of proactive action is not permitted. State parties must show genuine efforts to secure the economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in the ICESCR. The burden of proof for progressive action is considered on be with the state party. The prohibition on [[discrimination]] in relation to economic, social and cultural rights is regarded as having immediate effect. State parties must abolish laws, policies and practices which affect the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and take action to prevent discrimination in public life. All state parties, regardless of the economic situation in the country or resource scarcity, are required to ensure respect for minimum subsistence rights for all. State parties must also ensure that available resources are accessed and used equitably. Therefore, government decisions on how to allocate resources should be subject to scrutiny. Legislative measures alone are not sufficient to ensure compliance with the ICESCR and state parties are expected to provide judicial remedies in addition to taking administrative, financial, educational and social measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xvi-xvii | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monitoring, enforcement and implementation framework ==
[[Intergovernmental organisations]] and [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs) have persistently neglected economic, social and cultural rights over the past 50 years.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} While all human rights are said to be "equal, indivisible, interrelated, and interdependent", the monitoring, enforcement and implementation framework for economic, social and cultural rights is less advanced than that for [[civil and political rights]]. International enforcement mechanisms are strongest for civil and political rights, and their violation is considered more serious than that of economic, social and cultural rights. There are few international NGOs that focus on economic, social and cultural rights and there are few lawyers who have the knowledge or experience to defend economic, social and cultural rights at a national or international level. Economic, social and cultural rights are less likely than civil and political rights to be protected in national constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiii | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], which gives the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] competence to receive and consider communications from individuals claiming that their rights under the Covenant have been violated by a state party. The Protocol entered into force on 5 May 2013.

== Advocacy ==
Networking groups such as [[ESCR-Net]] are working to create online resources and spread information about effective cases, initiatives, and working groups promoting ideals and celebrating victories of human rights initiatives and the [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]. Currently, human rights advocacy groups are working diligently to fine-tune rules, regulations and implementation schemes; little news of complaint successes or failures is available.&lt;ref&gt;“Campaign for the Ratification and Implementation of the Optional Protocol to the ICESCR-Justice NOW! Ratify to protect all Human Rights.” ESCR-Net Newsletter December (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions ([[COHRE]]) has helped to establish the [[Housing and Property Directorate]] (HPD/HPCC) in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hassine, Regularizing Property Rights in Kosovo and Elsewhere, 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-86553-340-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory of rights ==
According to [[Karel Vasak]]'s theory of [[three generations of human rights]], economic, social and cultural rights are considered second-generation rights, while [[civil and political rights]], such as [[freedom of speech]], [[right to a fair trial]], and the [[right to vote]], are considered first-generation rights.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Vasak, "Human Rights: A Thirty-Year Struggle: the Sustained Efforts to give Force of law to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights", ''UNESCO Courier'' 30:11, Paris: [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]], November 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[negative and positive rights]] considers economic, social and cultural rights [[positive rights]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[File:"Mon han dog ikke skulle komme?".jpg|thumb|"Surely he will come?". Painting by [[Christen Dalsgaard]]. From the [[Hirschsprung Collection]], Denmark.]]
In the case of [[uncertainty]], '''expectation''' is what is considered the most likely to happen&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35 &lt;/ref&gt;. An expectation, which is a [[belief]] that is centered on the [[future]], may or may not be realistic. A less advantageous result gives rise to the [[emotion]] of [[disappointment]]&lt;ref&gt;Castelfranchi, C. and Miceli, M., 2011. Anticipation and emotion. In Emotion-Oriented Systems (pp. 483-500). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;. If something happens that is not at all expected, it is a [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]]. An expectation about the behavior or performance of another person, expressed to that person, may have the nature of a strong request, or an order; this kind of expectation is called a [[social norm]]. The degree to which something is expected to be true can be expressed using [[fuzzy logic]].

==Expectations of well-being==
[[Richard Lazarus]] asserts that people become accustomed to positive or negative life experiences which lead to favorable or unfavorable expectations of their present and near-future circumstances. Lazarus notes the widely accepted philosophical principle that "happiness depends on the background psychological status of the person...and cannot be well predicted without reference to one's expectations."&lt;ref name=Lazarus&gt;{{cite book |last=Lazarus |first=Richard |title=Emotion and Adaptation |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-19-506994-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to happiness or unhappiness, Lazarus notes that objective conditions of life are those of hardship and deprivation often make a positive assessment of their well-being," while "people who are objectively well off...often make a negative assessment of their well-being." Lazarus argues that "the most sensible explanation of this apparent paradox is that people...develop favorable or unfavorable ''expectations''" that guide such assessments.&lt;ref name=Lazarus/&gt;

==Expectations impact on beliefs==
Sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] wrote that a person's expectation is directly linked to [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. Whether or not such an expectation is truthful or not, has little or no effect on the outcome. If a person believes what they are told or convinces himself/herself of the fact, chances are this person will see the expectation to its inevitable conclusion. There is an inherent danger in this kind of labeling especially for the educator. Since children are easily convinced of certain tenets especially when told to them by an authority figure like a parent or teacher, they may believe whatever is taught to them even if what is taught has no factual basis. If the student or child were to act on false information, certain positive or negative [[unintended consequences]] could result. If overly positive or elevated expectations were used to describe or manipulate a person's [[self-image]] and execution falls short, the results could be a total reversal of that person's [[self-confidence]]. If thought of in terms of [[causality]] or cause and effect, the higher a person's expectation and the lower the execution, the higher the frustration level may become. This in turn could cause a total cessation of effort and motivate the person to quit.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Expectations elicitation ==
Expectations are a central part of value calculations in economics. For example, calculating the [[Subjective expected utility]] of an outcome requires knowing the both the value of an outcome and the probability that it will occur.  Researchers who elicit (or measure) the expectations of individuals can input these beliefs into the model in place of standard probabilities.  The strategy of eliciting individual expectations is now incorporated into many international surveys, including the [[Health and Retirement Study]] in the United States.

Expectations elicitation is used in many domains, including survival and educational outcomes, but may be most prominent in financial realms.  Expectations are theoretically important for models such as the [[Efficient-market hypothesis]] which suggest that all information should be incorporated into the market, as well as for [[Modern portfolio theory]] which suggests that investors must be compensated for higher levels of risk through higher (expected) returns.  Following these models, empirical research has found that consumers with more optimistic stock market expectations are more likely to hold riskier assets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vissing-Jorgenson|date=2003|title=Perspectives on Behavioral Finance: Does "Irrationality" Disappear with Wealth?

A '''fallacy of division''' occurs when one reasons [[logic]]ally that something true for the whole must also be true of all or some of its parts.

An example:

# The 2nd grade in Jefferson elementary eats a lot of ice cream
# Carlos is a 2nd grader in Jefferson elementary
# Therefore, Carlos eats a lot of ice cream

The converse of this [[fallacy]] is called [[fallacy of composition]], which arises when one fallaciously attributes a property of some part of a thing to the thing as a whole.  Both fallacies were addressed by [[Aristotle]] in ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]''.

In the philosophy of the ancient Greek [[Anaxagoras]], as claimed by the Roman [[atomist]] [[Lucretius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intellectual Property Protection of Fact-based Works: Copyright and Its Alternatives|page=110|first=Robert|last=Brauneis|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was assumed that the atoms constituting a substance must themselves have the salient observed properties of that substance: so atoms of water would be wet, atoms of iron would be hard, atoms of wool would be soft, etc. This doctrine is called ''[[homoeomeria (philosophy)|homoeomeria]]'', and it depends on the fallacy of division.

If a system as a whole has some property that none of its constituents has (or perhaps, it has it but not as a ''result'' of some constituent having that property), this is sometimes called an ''[[Emergence|emergent]]'' property of the system.

==Examples==

In [[statistics]] an [[ecological fallacy]] is a logical fallacy in the interpretation of statistical data where inferences about the nature of individuals are deduced from inference for the group to which those individuals belong. The four common statistical ecological fallacies are: confusion between ecological correlations and individual correlations, confusion between group average and total average,  [[Simpson's paradox]], and other statistical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Logic: A Modern Introduction to Deductive Reasoning|pages=160–163|first=Dailey|last=Burnham Terrell|year=1967|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foot binding''' was the custom of applying tight binding to the feet of young girls to modify the shape and size of their feet. It was practised in China from the [[Song dynasty]] until the early 20th century, and bound feet were considered a status symbol as well as a mark of beauty. Foot binding limited the mobility of women, and resulted in lifelong disabilities for most of its subjects, although some women with bound feet working outdoors have also been reported. Feet altered by binding were called '''lotus feet'''.

The practice possibly originated among upper class court dancers during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in 10th century China, then became popular among the elite during the [[Song dynasty]], eventually spreading to all social classes by the [[Qing dynasty]]. Foot binding was practiced in different forms, and the more severe form of binding may have been developed in the 16th century. It has been estimated that by the 19th century, 40–50% of all Chinese women may have had bound feet, and up to almost 100% among upper class Chinese women.&lt;ref name="lim" &gt;{{cite web |last=Lim |first=Louisa |title=Painful Memories for China's Footbinding Survivors |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=8966942 |work=Morning Edition |publisher=National Public Radio |date=19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence and practice of foot binding however varied in different parts of the country.

There had been attempts to end the practice during the Qing dynasty; Manchu [[Kangxi Emperor]] tried to ban foot binding in 1664 but failed.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In the later part of the 19th century, Chinese reformers challenged the practice but it was not until the early 20th century that foot binding began to die out as a result of anti-foot-binding campaigns.  Only a few elderly Chinese women still survive today with bound feet.&lt;ref name="lim"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Origin ===
[[File:Yaoniang binding feet.jpg|thumb|200px|18th-century illustration showing Yao Niang binding her own feet]]

There are a number of stories about the origin of foot binding before its establishment during the Song dynasty. One of these involves the story of a favorite consort of the [[Southern Qi]] emperor [[Xiao Baojuan]], [[Pan Yunu]] (died 501 AD), who had delicate feet and danced barefoot on a floor decorated with golden lotus flower design. The emperor expressed admiration and said that "lotus springs from her every step!" (步步生蓮), a reference to the Buddhist legend of Padmavati under whose feet lotus springs forth. This story may have given rise to the terms "golden lotus" or "lotus feet" used to describe bound feet; there is, however, no evidence that Consort Pan ever bound her feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=qpNQ91M3BswC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author=Dorothy Ko |pages=32–34 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23284-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general view is that the practice is likely to have originated from the time of the 10th-century [[Li Yu (Southern Tang)|Emperor Li Yu]] of the [[Southern Tang]], just before the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ptop/alabaster/A1155872 |title=Chinese Foot Binding |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Li Yu created a six-foot tall golden lotus decorated with precious stones and pearls, and asked his concubine {{Interlanguage link multi|Yao Niang|zh|3=窅娘}} to bind her feet in white silk into the shape of the crescent moon, and perform a ballet-like dance on the points of her feet on the lotus.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Yao Niang's dance was said to be so graceful that others sought to imitate her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=qpNQ91M3BswC&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author=Dorothy Ko |pages=42 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23284-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The binding of feet was then replicated by other upper-class women and the practice spread.&lt;ref name="pitts-taylor"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=66u24WAyO_YC&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body |page=203 |editor=Victoria Pitts-Taylor |publisher=Greenwood |date= 2008 |isbn=978-0-313-34145-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest possible references to foot binding appear around 1100, when a couple of poems seemed to allude to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/index.php/component/k2/item/10758-han-chinese-footbinding |title=Han Chinese Footbinding |work=Textile Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu Ji 徐積 《詠蔡家婦》： 「但知勒四支，不知裹两足。」(translation: "knowing about arranging the four limbs, but not about binding her two feet); [[Su Shi]] 蘇軾 《菩薩蠻》：「塗香莫惜蓮承步，長愁羅襪凌波去；只見舞回風，都無行處踪。偷穿宮樣穩，並立雙趺困，纖妙說應難，須從掌上看。」&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ebrey 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xjoLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 |title=The Inner Quarters: Marriage and the Lives of Chinese Women in the Sung Period|author= Patricia Buckley  Ebrey|pages=37–39 |isbn= 9780520913486 |publisher=University of California Press |date=1 December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; Soon after 1148,&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; in the earliest extant discourse on the practice of foot binding, scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Zhang Bangji|zh|3=張邦基}} wrote that a bound foot should be arch-shape and small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages=111–115 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wenxian.fanren8.com/08/05/5/8.htm |title=墨庄漫录-宋-张邦基  8-卷八 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that "women's footbinding began in recent times; it was not mentioned in any books from previous eras."&lt;ref name="Morris2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Morris (historian)|title=Why the West Rules - For Now: The Patterns of History, and What They Reveal About the Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qNVrfoSubmIC&amp;pg=PA424 |date=2011|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|isbn=978-1-55199-581-6|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Che Ruoshui|zh|3=车若水}} wrote the first known criticism of the practice: "Little girls not yet four or five years old, who have done nothing wrong, nevertheless are made to suffer unlimited pain to bind [their feet] small.

The earliest archaeological evidence for foot binding dates to the tombs of Huang Sheng, who died in 1243 at the age of 17, and Madame Zhou, who died in 1274. Each had her feet bound with 6-foot-long gauze strips. Zhou's skeleton was well preserved and showed that her feet fit the narrow, pointed slippers that were buried with her.&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; The style of bound feet found in Song dynasty tombs, where the big toe was bent upwards, appears to be different from the norm of later eras, and the excessive smallness of the feet, the "three-inch golden lotus", may be a later development in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages=187–191 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJHUFRTYpA4C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |pages=21–24 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Song dynasty, men would drink from a special shoe whose heel contained a small cup. During the [[Yuan dynasty]], some would also drink directly from the shoe itself. This practice was called "toast to the golden lotus" and lasted until the late [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref name="shoe"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=2Ifj9h4Z4YQC&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Art of the Shoe |author= Marie-Josèphe Bossan |page=164 |publisher=Parkstone Press Ltd |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-85995-803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European to mention footbinding was the Italian missionary [[Odoric of Pordenone]] in the fourteenth century during the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iL2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History |first=Patricia|last= Ebrey |page=196|publisher=Routledge |isbn= 9781134442935 |date=2003-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no other foreign visitors to [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] China mentioned the practice, including [[Ibn Battuta]] and [[Marco Polo]] (who nevertheless noted the dainty walk of Chinese women who took very small steps), perhaps an indication that it was not a widespread or extreme practice at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSfvfr8VQSEC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Marco Polo's China: A Venetian in the Realm of Khubilai Khan |first= Stephen G. |last=Haw |pages=55–56 |publisher=Routledge| isbn=9781134275427|date=2006-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice however was encouraged by the Mongol rulers on their Chinese subjects.&lt;ref name="pitts-taylor"/&gt; The practice became increasingly common among the gentry families, later spreading to the general population, as commoners and theatre actors alike adopted footbinding.

[[File:Chaussure chinoise Saverne 02 05 2012 1.jpg|thumb|230px|A lotus shoe for bound feet. The ideal length for a bound foot was 3 Chinese inches (寸), which is around {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in western measurement.]]

The Manchus issued a number of edicts to ban the practice, first in 1636 when the Manchu leader [[Hong Taiji]] declared the founding of the new Qing dynasty, then in 1638, and another in 1664 by the [[Kangxi Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYgQWAfHjmsC&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|author= Li-Hsiang, Lisa Rosenlee |page=144 |publisher= State University of New York Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-7914-6750-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, few Han Chinese complied with the edicts and Kangxi eventually abandoned the effort in 1668. 
By the 19th century, it was estimated that 40-50% of Chinese women had bound feet, and among upper class Han Chinese women, the figure was almost 100%.&lt;ref name="lim" /&gt; Bound feet became a mark of beauty and was also a prerequisite for finding a husband. It also became an avenue for poorer women to [[Hypergamy|marry into money]] in some areas; for example, in late 19th century Guangdong, it was customary to bind the feet of the eldest daughter of a lower-class family who was intended to be brought up as a lady. Her younger sisters would grow up to be bond-servants or domestic slaves and be able to work in the fields, but the eldest daughter would assume to never have the need to work. Women, their families, and their husbands took great pride in tiny feet, with the ideal length, called the "Golden Lotus", being about three [[Cun (unit)|Chinese inches]] long (around {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in Western measurement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=8 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manning|first=Mary Ellen|title=China's "Golden Lotus Feet" - Foot-binding Practice|url=http://travel.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474976997081|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=10 May 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928031927/http://travel.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474976997081|archivedate=28 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pride was reflected in the elegantly embroidered silk slippers and wrappings girls and women wore to cover their feet. Walking on bound feet necessitated bending the knees slightly and swaying to maintain proper movement and balance, a dainty walk that was also considered erotic to some men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity |author= Janell L.

Some women with bound feet may not walk without the support of their shoes and were severely limited in their mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NieEnuWegkoC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;lpg=PA302#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Film Review - Footbinding: Search for the Three Inch Golden Lotus |journal=Anthropologica |date=2004 |volume=48|issue=2|first=Laurel |last=Bossen |pages=301–303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many women with bound feet were still able to walk and work in the fields, albeit with greater limitation than their non-bound counterparts.  In the 19th and early 20th century, dancers with bound feet were popular, as were circus performers who stood on prancing or running horses. Women with bound feet in one village in [[Yunnan]] Province even formed a regional dance troupe to perform for tourists in the late 20th century, though age has since forced the group to retire.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; In other areas, women in their 70s and 80s could be found providing limited assistance to the workers in the rice fields well into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="lim" /&gt;

=== Demise ===
Opposition to foot binding had been raised by some Chinese writers in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century, many of the rebel leaders of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] were of Hakka background whose womenfolk did not bind their feet, and foot binding was outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYjGN4UM1mMC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=27–29 |title=The Taiping Ideology: Its Sources, Interpretations, and Influences|author1=Vincent Yu-Chung Shih |author2=Yu-chung Shi |publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1968 |isbn=978-0-295-73957-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBqr_MEn4m4C&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=For Our Daughters: How Outstanding Women Worldwide Have Balanced Home and Career|author= Olivia Cox-Fill|page=57|publisher=Praeger Publishers |year= 1996|isbn= 978-0-275-95199-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion however failed, and Christian missionaries, who had provided education for girls and actively discouraged what they considered a barbaric practice, then played a part in changing elite opinion on footbinding through education, [[pamphleteering]], and lobbying of the Qing court.&lt;ref name="blake 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cross-cultural Study of Women: A Comprehensive Guide|author= Mary I.

"  Besides improvements in civil engineering, progress was made in social areas as well. The traditional Chinese practice of foot binding was widespread in Taiwan's early years. Traditional Chinese society perceived women with smaller feet as being more beautiful. Women would bind their feet with long bandages to stunt growth.
Even housemaids were divided into those with bound feet and those without. The former served the daughters of the house, while the latter were assigned heavier work. This practice was later regarded as barbaric. In the early years of the Japanese colonial period, the Foot-binding Liberation Society was established to promote the idea of natural feet, but its influence was limited.
The fact that women suffered higher casualties in the 1906 Meishan quake with 551 men and 700 women dead, and 1,099 men and 1,334 women injured--very different from the situation in Japan--raised public concern. Foot binding was blamed and this gave impetus to the drive to stamp out the practice."&lt;/ref&gt; The practice however lingered on in some regions in China; in 1928, a census in rural [[Shanxi]] found that 18% of women had bound feet,&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125800116737444883  |title=Bound by History: The Last of China's 'Lotus-Feet' Ladies |author= Simon Montlake |date = November 13, 2009 |work=Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in some remote rural areas such as [[Yunnan Province]] it continued to be practiced until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Favazza, Armando R.

Foot binding was practiced in various forms and its prevalence varied in different regions. A less severe form in Sichuan, called "cucumber foot" (''huanggua jiao'') due to its slender shape, folded the four toes under but did not distort the heel and taper the ankle.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=7 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some working women in [[Jiangsu]] made a pretense of binding while keeping their feet natural.&lt;ref name="blake 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA327#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History |author=C Fred Blake|pages=327–329|editor= Bonnie G.

[[Manchu people|Manchu]] women, as well as Mongol and Chinese women in the [[Eight Banners]], did not bind their feet, and the most a Manchu woman might do was to wrap the feet tightly to give them a slender appearance.&lt;ref name="manchu"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last=Elliott|first=Mark C.|title=The Manchu Way: the Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0-8047-3606-0|pages=246–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Manchus, wanting to emulate the particular gait that bound feet necessitated, adapted their own form of platform shoes to cause them to walk in a similar swaying manner. These "flower bowl" (花盆鞋) or "horse-hoof" shoes (馬蹄鞋) have a platform generally made of wood two to six inches in height and fitted to the middle of the sole, or they have a small central tapered pedestal. Many Han Chinese in the Inner City of Beijing also did not bind their feet, and it was reported in the mid-1800s that around 50-60% of non-banner women had unbound feet. Bound feet nevertheless became a significant differentiating marker between Han women and Manchu or other banner women.&lt;ref name="manchu" /&gt;

}}

The process was started before the arch of the foot had a chance to develop fully, usually between the ages of 4 and 9. Binding usually started during the winter months since the feet were more likely to be numb, and therefore the pain would not be as extreme.&lt;ref name="slippers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Beverley|title=Splendid Slippers: A Thousand Years of an Erotic Tradition |publisher=Ten Speed Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-89815-957-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, each foot would be soaked in a warm mixture of herbs and animal blood; this was intended to soften the foot and aid the binding. Then, the toenails were cut back as far as possible to prevent in-growth and subsequent infections, since the toes were to be pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. Cotton bandages, 3&amp;nbsp;m long and 5&amp;nbsp;cm wide (10&amp;nbsp;ft by 2 in), were prepared by soaking them in the blood and herb mixture. To enable the size of the feet to be reduced, the toes on each foot were curled under, then pressed with great force downwards and squeezed into the sole of the foot until the toes broke.

The broken toes were held tightly against the sole of the foot while the foot was then drawn down straight with the leg and the arch of the foot was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.
[[File:Bound feet (X-ray).jpg|thumb|An X-ray of two bound feet]]
[[File:FootBindingRxSchema2.gif|thumb|Schema of an x-ray comparison between an unbound and bound foot]]

The girl's broken feet required a great deal of care and attention, and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the feet were unbound, they were washed, the toes carefully checked for injury, and the nails carefully and meticulously trimmed. When unbound, the broken feet were also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl's feet were often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The feet were also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;

Immediately after this procedure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The bindings were pulled even tighter each time the girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated as often as possible (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants two or three times a week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.&lt;ref name=slippers /&gt;

For most the bound feet eventually became numb.  However, once a foot had been crushed and bound, attempting to reverse the process by unbinding was painful,&lt;ref name=body&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0122BsqrZwC&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Encyclopedia of Body Adornment|author= Margo DeMello |pages=116–117 |publisher=Greenwood Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-313-33695-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the shape could not be reversed without a woman undergoing the same pain all over again.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

=== Health issues ===
The most common problem with bound feet was infection. Despite the amount of care taken in regularly trimming the toenails, they would often in-grow, becoming infected and causing injuries to the toes. Sometimes, for this reason, the girl's toenails would be peeled back and removed altogether. The tightness of the binding meant that the circulation in the feet was faulty, and the circulation to the toes was almost cut off, so any injuries to the toes were unlikely to heal and were likely to gradually worsen and lead to infected toes and rotting flesh. The necrosis of the flesh would also initially give off a foul odor, and later the smell may come from various microorganisms that colonized the folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/21/china.gender |title= The ties that bind |first=Fraser|last= Newham|date= 21 March 2005 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the infection in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; however, this was seen as a benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ac2UAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA423#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=

At the beginning of the binding, many of the foot bones would remain broken, often for years. However, as the girl grew older, the bones would begin to heal. Even after the foot bones had healed, they were prone to re-breaking repeatedly, especially when the girl was in her teenage years and her feet were still soft. Bones in the girls' feet would often be deliberately broken again in order to further change the size or shape of the feet. This was especially the case with the toes, as small toes were especially desirable.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls, since they could not balance securely on their feet, and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, S. &amp; Stone, K.

Before footbinding was practiced in China, admiration for small feet already existed as demonstrated by the [[Tang dynasty]] tale of [[Ye Xian]] written around 850 by [[Duan Chengshi]].

Some also considered bound feet to be intensely erotic, and Qing Dynasty sex manuals listed 48 different ways of playing with women's bound feet. Some men preferred never to see a woman's bound feet, so they were always concealed within tiny "lotus shoes" and wrappings.  According to [[Robert van Gulik]], the bound feet were also considered the most intimate part of a woman's body; in erotic art of the Qing to Song periods where the genitalia may be shown, the bound feet were never depicted uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85M3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Sexual life in ancient China:A Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from Ca. 1500 B.C.

An erotic effect of the bound feet was the lotus gait, the tiny steps and swaying walk of a woman whose feet had been bound. Women with such deformed feet avoided placing weight on the front of the foot and tended to walk predominantly on their heels. As a result, women who had undergone foot-binding would walk in a cautious and unsteady manner.&lt;ref name=slippers /&gt;  Some men found the smell of the bound feet attractive, and some also apparently believed that bound feet would cause layers of folds to develop in the vagina, and that the thighs would become sensuously heavier and the vagina tighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmdKklZM9-kC&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Bodies under Siege: Self-mutilation, Nonsuicidal Self-injury, and Body Modification in Culture and Psychiatry|author= Armando R.

===Role of Confucianism===
[[File:A HIGH CASTE LADYS DAINTY LILY FEET.jpg|thumb|220px|A woman with her feet unwrapped]]

A common argument is that the revival of [[Confucianism]] as [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the Song dynasty resulted in the decline of the status of women, and that in addition to promoting the seclusion of women and the [[cult of widow chastity]], it also contributed to the development of footbinding.&lt;ref name="ebrey 2"/&gt; According to [[Robert van Gulik]], the prominent Song Confucian scholar [[Zhu Xi]] stressed the inferiority of women as well as the need to keep men and women strictly separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|author= Anders Hansson|page=46 |publisher=Brill |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-9004105966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by [[Lin Yutang]] among others, probably based on an oral tradition, that [[Zhu Xi]] also promoted footbinding in [[Fujian]] as a way of encouraging chastity among women, that by restricting their movement it would help keep men and women separate.&lt;ref name="ebrey 2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDPskRXfl5cC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History|author= Patricia Buckley Ebrey |pages=10&amp;ndash;12|publisher=Routledge |date=19 September 2002 |isbn= 978-0415288224}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian [[Patricia Buckley Ebrey|Patricia Ebrey]] suggests that this story might be fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA139|title= Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation |author= Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |date= April 2006|isbn= 978-0-7914-6749-7 |page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Confucian moralists in fact disapproved of the erotic associations of footbinding, and unbound women were also praised.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bonnie G. Smith|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=PA358|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-514890-9|pages=358–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Neo-Confucian [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] was said to be against footbinding and his family and descendants did not bind their feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=丁传靖 编|title=《宋人轶事汇编》|location=北京|publisher=中华书局|date=1981|page=卷9，第2册，页455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/foot-binding-and-ruism-confucianism_us_58c86e8fe4b01d0d473bceed |title=Foot-binding and Ruism (Confucianism)|date=16 March 2017 |author= Bin Song|work=Huffington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern Confucian scholars such as [[Tu Weiming]] also dispute any causal link between neo-Confucianism and footbinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Confucian thought: selfhood as creative transformation|author= Tu Wei-ming|publisher= State University of New York Press|date= 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that Confucian doctrine in fact prohibits mutilation of the body as people should not "injure even the hair and skin of the body received from mother and father". It is however argued that such injunction applies less to women, rather it is meant to emphasize the sacred link between sons and their parents. Furthermore, it is argued that Confucianism institutionalized the family system in which women are called upon to sacrifice themselves for the good of the family, a system that fostered such practice.&lt;ref name="blake"/&gt; Confucian instructions on the moral behaviour of women would include examples of women who were prepared to die or suffer mutilation to show their commitment to the Confucian ethos.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

Historian [[Dorothy Y. Ko|Dorothy Ko]] proposed that footbinding may be an expression of the Confucian ideals of civility and culture in the form of correct attire or bodily adornment, and that footbinding was seen as a necessary part of being feminine as well as being civilized.  Footbinding was often classified in Chinese encyclopedia as clothing or a form of bodily embellishment rather than mutilation; one from 1591 for example placed footbinding in a section on "Female Adornments" that included hairdos, powders, and ear-piercings.  According to Ko, the perception of footbinding as a civilised practice may be evinced from a [[Ming dynasty]] account that mentioned a proposal to "entice [the barbarians] to civilize their customs" by encouraging footbinding among their womenfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://womenshistory.osu.edu/sites/womenshistory.osu.edu/files/The%20Body%20as%20Attire.pdf |title=The Body as Attire: The Shifting Meanings of Footbinding in Seventeenth-Century China |journal=Journal of Women's History|volume =8|number= 4 |date= 1997 |pages= 8–27 |doi= 10.1353/jowh.2010.0171 |first=Dorothy|last= Ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was also carried out only by women on girls, and it served to emphasize the distinction between male and female, an emphasis that began from an early age.&lt;ref name="steele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ko1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorothy Ko|title=Teachers of the Inner Chambers: Women and Culture in Seventeenth-century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nNcRiE-TKsC&amp;pg=PA149|year=1994|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2359-6|pages=149–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Fred Blake argued that the practice of footbinding was a form of discipline undertaken by women themselves, and perpetuated by women on their daughters, so as to inform their daughters of their role and position in society, and to support and participate in the neo-Confucian way of being civilized.&lt;ref name="blake"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://anthropology.hawaii.edu/People/Faculty/Blake/pdfs/1994%20%20Foot-binding%20in%20Neo-Confucian%20China.pdf|title=Foot-Binding in Neo-Confucian China and the Appropriation of Female Labor | author=C.

===Feminist perspective===
{{Violence against women|sp=uk}}
Foot binding is often seen by feminists as an oppressive practice against women who were victims of a sexist culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation |authors=Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |page=139 | isbn=9780791481790|publisher= SUNY Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rophdLUYIjcC&amp;pg=PT246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding, Feminism and Freedom: The Liberation of Women's Bodies in Modern China|author= Fan Hong|isbn=9781136303142 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also widely seen as a form of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ac2UAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA423 |title=Ordinary Violence: Everyday Assaults against Women Worldwide|edition= 2nd|author= Mary White Stewart |pages=423–437 |publisher=Praeger|date=27 January 2014|isbn= 9781440829383}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOKAMXEA_jQC&amp;pg=PA310 |title=Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Violence, Volume 1 |editors= Claire M.

She argued that women, by retaining their small bound feet, made themselves subservient as it would mean women imprisoning themselves indoors. She believed that women should emancipate themselves from oppression, that girls can ensure their independence through education, and that they should develop new mental and physical qualities fitting for the new era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cLd_h5Hh00C&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding, Feminism, and Freedom: The Liberation of Women's Bodies in Modern China|author= Hong Fan |publisher= Routledge |pages= 90–96|date=1 June 1997|isbn= 978-0714646336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qiu jin"/&gt; The ending of the practice is seen as a significant event in the process of female emancipation in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cLd_h5Hh00C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding, Feminism, and Freedom: The Liberation of Women's Bodies in Modern China|author= Hong Fan |publisher= Routledge |date=1 June 1997|isbn= 978-0714646336 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other interpretations===

Some scholars such as Laurel Bossen and Hill Gates reject the theories that bound feet in China were considered more beautiful, or that it was a means of male control over women, a sign of class status, or a chance for women to marry well. They argued that foot binding was important in work, and can be seen as a way by mothers to tie their daughters down, train them in handwork and keep them close at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/12/unraveling-a-brutal-custom/ |title=Unraveling a brutal custom |author=Colleen Walsh |work=Harvard Gazette |date=December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that while the practice started out as a fashion, it persisted because it became an expression of Han identity after the Mongols invaded China in 1279, and later the Manchus' conquest in 1644, as it was then practiced only by Han women.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;&lt;ref name="steele"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw1_yKwk_XkC&amp;pg=PA40 |pages=40–41 |title=China Chic: East Meets West|author1=Valerie Steele |author2=John S. Major |publisher=Yale University Press |year= 2000 |isbn=978-0-300-07931-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Qing Dynasty, attempts were made by the Manchus to ban the practice but failed, and it has been argued the attempts at banning may have in fact led to a spread of the practice among Han Chinese in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA266#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |page=266 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature, film and television ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
&lt;!-- This is not a place to list every novel that mentions footbinding, or a film or TV shows that happens to have a character with bound feet. --&gt;

The bound foot has played a prominent part in many media works, both Chinese and non-Chinese, modern and traditional. These depictions are sometimes based on observation or research and sometimes on rumors or supposition. Sometimes, as in the case of [[Pearl Buck]]'s ''[[The Good Earth]]'' (1931), the accounts are relatively neutral, implying a respect for Chinese culture and assuming that it is not the role of outsiders to promote reform. Sometimes the accounts seem intended to rouse like-minded Chinese and foreign opinion to abolish the custom, and sometimes the accounts imply [[wikt:condescension|condescension]] or [[wikt:contempt|contempt]] for China.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Ebrey, "Gender and Sinology: Shifting Western Interpretations of Footbinding, 1300–1890", ''Late Imperial China'' 20.2  (1999): 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

It describes her feet being bound, and later unbound, when she needed to help her family with farm labour.
* [[Emily Prager]]'s short story "A Visit from the Footbinder", from her collection of short stories of the same name (1982), describes the last few hours of a young Chinese girl's childhood before the professional footbinder arrives to initiate her into the adult woman's life of beauty and pain.
* [[Lisa Loomer]]'s play ''The Waiting Room'' (1994) deals with themes of [[body modification]]. One of the three main characters is an 18th-century Chinese woman who arrives in a modern hospital waiting room seeking medical help for complications resulting from her bound feet.

The '''gyrator–capacitor model'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=223957 |title = Lumped equivalent circuits of magnetic components: the gyrator-capacitor approach|author=D.C. Hamill|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics|
volume = 8 | issue = 2|date = 1993 |pages = 97–103|doi = 10.1109/63.223957|bibcode = 1993ITPE....8...97H}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[lumped element model|lumped-element model]] for [[magnetic fields]], similar to [[magnetic circuit]]s, but based on using elements analogous to capacitors (see [[magnetic capacitance]]) rather than elements analogous to resistors (see [[magnetic reluctance]]) to represent the magnetic flux path.   Windings are represented as [[gyrator]]s, interfacing between the electrical circuit and the magnetic model.

The primary advantage of the gyrator–capacitor model compared to the magnetic reluctance model is that the model preserves the correct values of energy flow, storage and dissipation.  The gyrator–capacitor model is an example of a [[Mechanical–electrical analogies#Other energy domains|group of analogies]] that preserve energy flow across energy domains by making power conjugate pairs of variables in the various domains analogous.

==Magnetic effective resistance==
'''Magnetic effective resistance''' ([[SI unit]]: [[Omega|Ω]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) is the [[Real analysis|real]] component of [[Magnetic impedance|complex magnetic impedance]].  This causes a magnetic circuit to lose magnetic potential energy.&lt;ref name=Pohl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Küpfmüller&gt;[[Karl Küpfmüller|Küpfmüller K.]] Einführung in die theoretische Elektrotechnik, Springer-Verlag, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; Active power in a magnetic circuit equals the product of magnetic effective resistance &lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt; and magnetic current squared &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{M}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;P = r_\mathrm{M} I_\mathrm{M}^2&lt;/math&gt;

The magnetic effective resistance on a complex plane appears as the side of the resistance triangle for magnetic circuit of an alternating current. The effective magnetic resistance is bounding with the effective magnetic conductance &lt;math&gt;g_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt; by the expression

:&lt;math&gt;g_\mathrm{M} = \frac{r_\mathrm{M}}{z_\mathrm{M}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the full magnetic impedance of a magnetic circuit.

==Magnetic inductance==
{{distinguish||magnetic induction}}
In a [[magnetic circuit]], '''''magnetic inductance (inductive magnetic reactance)''''' is the analogy to inductance in an electrical circuit. In the SI system, it is measured in units of -[[ohm|Ω]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  This model makes [[magnetomotive force]] (mmf) the analog of [[electromotive force]] in electrical circuits, and time rate of change of magnetic flux the analog of electric current.

For phasor analysis the magnetic inductive reactance is:

:&lt;math&gt;x_\mathrm{L} = \omega L_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;L_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic inductivity ([[SI unit]]: s·[[ohm|Ω]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the magnetic circuit

In the complex form it is a positive imaginary number:

:&lt;math&gt;jx_\mathrm{L} = j\omega L_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnetic potential energy sustained by magnetic inductivity varies with the frequency of oscillations in electric fields. The average power in a given period is equal to zero.  Due to its dependence on frequency, magnetic inductance is mainly observable in magnetic circuits which operate at [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and/or [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] frequencies.

The notion of magnetic inductivity is employed in analysis and computation of circuit behavior in the  gyrator–capacitor model in a way analogous to [[inductance]] in electrical circuits.

==Magnetic impedance==
'''Magnetic impedance''' ([[SI unit]]: [[Omega|Ω]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) is the ratio of a sinusoidal magnetic tension &lt;math&gt;N_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; to a sinusoidal magnetic current &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{Mm}&lt;/math&gt; in a gyrator–capacitor model. Analogous to [[electrical impedance]], magnetic impedance is likewise a complex variable.

:&lt;math&gt;z_\mathrm{M} = \frac{N}{I_\mathrm{M}} = \frac{N_\mathrm{m}}{I_\mathrm{Mm}}&lt;/math&gt;

Magnetic impedance is also called the ''full'' magnetic resistance. It is derived from:

:&lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{M} = z_\mathrm{M} \cos \phi&lt;/math&gt;, the [[magnetic effective resistance|effective magnetic resistance]] (real)
:&lt;math&gt;x_\mathrm{M} = z_\mathrm{M} \sin \phi&lt;/math&gt;, the [[magnetic reactive resistance|reactive magnetic resistance]] (imaginary)

The phase angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; of the magnetic impedance is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \arctan {\frac{x_\mathrm{M}}{r_\mathrm{M}}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Magnetic reactance==
'''Magnetic reactance''' is the parameter of a passive [[magnetic circuit]] or an element of the circuit, which is equal to the square root of the difference of squares of the [[magnetic complex impedance]] and [[magnetic effective resistance]] to a magnetic current, taken with the sign plus, if the magnetic current lags behind the [[Magnetic tension force|magnetic tension]] in phase, and with the sign minus, if the magnetic current leads the magnetic tension in phase.

language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Küpfmüller/&gt; is the component of [[magnetic complex impedance]] of the [[alternating current]] circuit, which produces the phase shift between a magnetic current and magnetic tension in the circuit. It is measured in units of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;). It may be inductive &lt;math&gt;x_L = \omega L_M&lt;/math&gt; or capacitive &lt;math&gt;x_C = \tfrac{1}{\omega C_M}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of a magnetic current, &lt;math&gt;L_M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic inductivity]] of a circuit, &lt;math&gt;C_M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic capacitivity]] of a circuit. The magnetic reactance of an undeveloped circuit with the inductivity and the capacitivity, which are connected in series, is equal: &lt;math&gt;x = x_L - x_C = \omega L_M - \frac{1}{\omega C_M}&lt;/math&gt; . If  &lt;math&gt;x_L = x_C&lt;/math&gt;, then the net reactance  &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; and [[resonance]] takes place in the circuit. In the general case  &lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt{z^2 - r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.  When an energy loss is absent  (&lt;math&gt;r = 0&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;x = z&lt;/math&gt;. The angle of the phase shift in a magnetic circuit &lt;math&gt;\phi = \arctan{\frac{x}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;. On a complex plane, the magnetic reactance appears as the side of the resistance triangle for circuit of an alternating current.

==Magnetic capacitivity==
'''Magnetic capacitivity''' ([[SI unit]]: [[Henry (unit)|H]]), denoted as &lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt;, is an [[extensive property]] and is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{M} = \mu_\mathrm{r} \mu_0\frac{S}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
&lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{r} \mu_0 = \mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]],  
&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the element cross-section, and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the element length.

For [[phasor analysis]], the magnetic permeability&lt;ref name=Arkadiew&gt;Arkadiew W. ''Eine Theorie des elektromagnetischen Feldes in den ferromagnetischen Metallen''. – Phys. Zs., H. 14, No 19, 1913, S. 928-934.&lt;/ref&gt; and the magnetic capacitivity are complex values.&lt;ref name=Arkadiew/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popov/&gt;

Magnetic capacitivity is also equal to magnetic flux divided by the difference of [[magnetic potential]] across the element.

&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{M} = \frac{\Phi}{\phi_\mathrm{M1}-\phi_\mathrm{M2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_\mathrm{M1}-\phi_\mathrm{M2}&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of the [[magnetic potential]]s.

The notion of magnetic capacitivity is employed in the gyrator–capacitor model in a way analogous to [[capacitance]] in electrical circuits.

==Magnetic complex impedance==
'''''Magnetic complex impedance''''' is equal to the relationship of the complex effective or amplitude value of a sinusoidal [[magnetic tension]] on the passive [[magnetic circuit]] or its element, and accordingly the complex effective or amplitude value of a sinusoidal magnetic current in this circuit or in this element.

Magnetic complex impedance [1, 2] is measured in units – [&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;] and determined by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;Z_M = \frac{\dot N}{\dot {I}_M} = \frac{\dot {N}_m}{\dot {I}_Mm} = z_M e^{j\phi}&lt;/math&gt;
 
where
&lt;math&gt;z_M = \frac{N}{I_M} = \frac{N_m}{I_{Mm}}&lt;/math&gt; is the relationship of the effective or amplitude value of a [[magnetic tension]] and accordingly of the effective or amplitude magnetic current is called [[full magnetic resistance]] ([[magnetic impedance]]). The [[full magnetic resistance]] ([[magnetic impedance]]) is equal to the modulus of the [[complex magnetic impedance]]. The [[argument]] of a [[complex magnetic impedance]] is equal to the difference of the phases of the [[magnetic tension]] and magnetic current &lt;math&gt;\phi = \beta - \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
[[Complex magnetic impedance]] can be presented in following form:

&lt;math&gt;Z_M = z_M e^{j\phi} = z_M \cos \phi + jz_M \sin \phi = r_M + jx_M &lt;/math&gt;

where 
&lt;math&gt;r_M = z_M \cos \phi&lt;/math&gt; is the real part of the [[complex magnetic impedance]], called the [[effective magnetic resistance]];    
&lt;math&gt;x_M = z_M \sin \phi&lt;/math&gt; is the imaginary part of the [[complex magnetic impedance]], called the [[reactive magnetic resistance]].  
The [[full magnetic resistance]] ([[magnetic impedance]]) is equal

&lt;math&gt;z_M = \sqrt{r_{M}^2 + x_{M}^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi = \arctan {\frac{x_M}{r_M}}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4848">'''Hume's principle''' or '''HP'''—the terms were coined by [[George Boolos]]—says that the number of ''F''s is equal to the number of ''G''s if and only if there is a [[one-to-one correspondence]] (a [[bijection]]) between the ''F''s and the ''G''s. HP can be stated formally in systems of [[second-order logic]]. Hume's principle is named for the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]].

HP plays a central role in [[Gottlob Frege]]'s philosophy of mathematics. Frege shows that HP and suitable definitions of arithmetical notions [[logical consequence|entail]] all axioms of what we now call [[second-order arithmetic]]. This result is known as [[Frege's theorem]], which is the foundation for a philosophy of mathematics known as [[Logicism#Neo-logicism|neo-logicism]].

== Origins ==
Hume's principle appears in Frege's ''Foundations of Arithmetic'' (§73), which quotes from Part III of Book I of [[David Hume]]'s ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1740). Hume there sets out seven fundamental relations between ideas. Concerning one of these, [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] in [[quantity]] or [[number]], Hume argues that our reasoning about proportion in quantity, as represented by [[geometry]], can never achieve "perfect precision and exactness", since its principles are derived from sense-appearance. He contrasts this with reasoning about number or [[arithmetic]], in which such a precision ''can'' be attained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Algebra and arithmetic [are] the only sciences in which we can carry on a chain of reasoning to any degree of intricacy, and yet preserve a perfect exactness and certainty. We are possessed of a precise standard, by which we can judge of the equality and proportion of numbers; and according as they correspond or not to that standard, we determine their relations, without any possibility of error. ''When two numbers are so combined, as that the one has always a unit answering to every unit of the other, we pronounce them equal''; and it is for want of such a standard of equality in [spatial] extension, that geometry can scarce be esteemed a perfect and infallible science. (I. III. I.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note Hume's use of the word ''[[number]]'' in the ancient sense, to mean a set or collection of things rather than the common modern notion of "positive integer". The ancient Greek notion of number (''arithmos'') is of a finite plurality composed of units. See [[Aristotle]], ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', 1020a14 and [[Euclid]], ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', Book VII, Definition 1 and 2. The contrast between the old and modern conception of number is discussed in detail in Mayberry (2000).

== Influence on set theory ==
The principle that [[cardinal number]] was to be characterized in terms of [[one-to-one correspondence]] had previously been used to great effect by [[Georg Cantor]], whose writings [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] knew. The suggestion has therefore been made that Hume's principle ought better be called "Cantor's Principle". But Frege criticized Cantor on the ground that Cantor defines [[cardinal number]]s in terms of [[ordinal number]]s, whereas Frege wanted to give a characterization of cardinals that was independent of the ordinals. Cantor's point of view, however, is the one embedded in contemporary theories of [[transfinite number]]s, as developed in [[axiomatic set theory]].

A '''hydrogen atom''' is an [[atom]] of the [[chemical element]] [[hydrogen]]. The [[Electric charge|electrically]] neutral atom contains a single positively charged [[proton]] and a single negatively charged [[electron]] bound to the nucleus by the [[Coulomb force]]. '''Atomic hydrogen''' constitutes [[abundance of the chemical elements|about 75%]] of the [[baryon]]ic mass of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

In everyday life on Earth, isolated hydrogen atoms (called "atomic hydrogen") are extremely rare. Instead, hydrogen tends to combine with other atoms in compounds, or with itself to form ordinary ([[diatomic]]) hydrogen gas, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. "Atomic hydrogen" and "hydrogen atom" in ordinary English use have overlapping, yet distinct, meanings. For example, a water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms, but does not contain atomic hydrogen (which would refer to isolated hydrogen atoms).

[[Atomic spectroscopy]] shows that there is a discrete infinite set of states in which a hydrogen (or any) atom can exist, contrary to the predictions of [[classical physics]]. Attempts to develop a theoretical understanding of the states of the hydrogen atom have been important to the [[history of quantum mechanics]], since all other atoms can be roughly understood by knowing in detail about this simplest atomic structure.

==Isotopes==
{{Main|Isotopes of hydrogen}}
The most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant]] [[isotope]], '''hydrogen-1''', '''protium''', or '''light hydrogen''', contains no [[neutron]]s and is simply a [[proton]] and an [[electron]]. Protium is [[Proton decay|stable]] and makes up 99.985% of naturally occurring hydrogen atoms.&lt;ref name=Housecroft&gt;{{cite book |last1=Housecroft |first=Catherine E. |last2=Sharpe |first2=Alan G. |edition=2nd |date=2005 |title=Inorganic Chemistry |publisher=Pearson Prentice-Hall |page=237 |isbn=0130-39913-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deuterium]] contains one neutron and one proton. Deuterium is stable and makes up 0.0156% of naturally occurring hydrogen&lt;ref name=Housecroft/&gt; and is used in industrial processes like [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[Deuterium NMR|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]].

[[Tritium]] contains two neutrons and one proton and is not stable, decaying with a [[half-life]] of 12.32 years. Because of the short half life, tritium does not exist in nature except in trace amounts.

Higher isotopes of hydrogen are only created in artificial [[Particle accelerator|accelerators]] and reactors and have half lives around the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

The formulas below are valid for all three isotopes of hydrogen, but slightly different values of the [[Rydberg constant]] (correction formula given below) must be used for each hydrogen isotope.

==Hydrogen ion==
{{Main|Hydron (chemistry)}}
Hydrogen is not found without its electron in ordinary chemistry (room temperatures and pressures), as ionized hydrogen is highly chemically reactive. When ionized hydrogen is written as "H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;" as in the solvation of classical acids such as [[hydrochloric acid]], the [[hydronium ion]], [[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is meant, not a literal ionized single hydrogen atom. In that case, the acid transfers the proton to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to form H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Ionized hydrogen without its electron, or free protons, are common in the [[interstellar medium]], and [[solar wind]].

==Theoretical analysis==
The hydrogen atom has special significance in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] as a simple [[two-body problem]] physical system which has yielded many simple [[closed-form expression|analytical]] solutions in closed-form.

=== Failed classical description ===
[[Rutherford model|Experiments]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1909 showed the structure of the atom to be a dense, positive nucleus with a light, negative charge orbiting around it. This immediately caused problems on how such a system could be stable. [[Classical electromagnetism]] had shown that any accelerating charge radiates energy described through the [[Larmor formula]]. If the electron is assumed to orbit in a perfect circle and radiates energy continuously, the electron would rapidly spiral into the nucleus with a fall time of:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/orbitdecay.pdf|title = Classical Lifetime of a Bohr Atom|date = March 7, 2005|website = |publisher = Joseph Henry Laboratories, Princeton University|last = Olsen|first = James|last2 = McDonald|first2 = Kirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t_\text{fall} \approx \frac{ a_0^3}{4 r_0^2 c} \approx 1.6 \cdot 10^{-11} \text{s}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bohr radius]] and &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[classical electron radius]]. If this were true, all atoms would instantly collapse, however atoms seem to be stable. Furthermore, the spiral inward would release a smear of electromagnetic frequencies as the orbit got smaller. Instead, atoms were observed to only emit discrete frequencies of radiation. The resolution would lie in the development of [[quantum mechanics]].

=== Bohr-Sommerfeld Model ===
{{Main|Bohr model}}In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] obtained the energy levels and spectral frequencies of the hydrogen atom after making a number of simple assumptions in order to correct the failed classical model. The assumptions included:
# Electrons can only be in certain, discrete circular orbits or ''stationary states'', thereby having a discrete set of possible radii and energies.
# Electrons do not emit radiation while in one of these stationary states.
# An electron can gain or lose energy by jumping from one discrete orbital to another. 
Bohr supposed that the electron's angular momentum is quantized with possible values:

&lt;math&gt;L = n \hbar&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;n = 1,2,3,...&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck constant]] over &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;. He also supposed that the [[centripetal force]] which keeps the electron in its orbit is provided by the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], and that energy is conserved. Bohr derived the energy of each orbit of the hydrogen atom to be:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://alpha.chem.umb.edu/chemistry/ch115/carter/files/103more/BohrEquations.pdf|title = Derivation of Bohr’s Equations for the One-electron Atom|website = |publisher = University of Massachusetts Boston|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;E_n = - \frac{  m_e e^4}{2 ( 4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2 } \frac{1}{n^2}   &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;m_e   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron mass]], &lt;math&gt;e   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron charge]], &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]], and &lt;math&gt;n   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[quantum number]] (now known as the [[principal quantum number]]). Bohr's predictions matched experiments measuring the [[hydrogen spectral series]] to the first order, giving more confidence to a theory that used quantized values.

For &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, the value

Mohr, B.N. Taylor, and D.B. Newell (2011), "The 2010 CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants" (Web Version 6.0). This database was developed by J. Baker, M. Douma, and S. Kotochigova. Available: http://physics.nist.gov/constants. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?ryd Link to R&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;], [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?rydhcev Link to hcR&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
is called the Rydberg unit of energy. It is related to the [[Rydberg constant]] &lt;math&gt;R_\infty&lt;/math&gt; of [[atomic physics]] by &lt;math&gt;1 \,\text{Ry} \equiv h c R_\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The exact value of the Rydberg constant assumes that the nucleus is infinitely massive with respect to the electron. For hydrogen-1, hydrogen-2 ([[deuterium]]), and hydrogen-3 ([[tritium]]) the constant must be slightly modified to use the [[reduced mass]] of the system, rather than simply the mass of the electron. However, since the nucleus is much heavier than the electron, the values are nearly the same. The Rydberg constant ''R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a hydrogen atom (one electron), ''R'' is given by

&lt;math&gt;R_M = \frac{R_\infty}{1+m_{\text{e}}/M},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the atomic nucleus.  For hydrogen-1, the quantity &lt;math&gt;m_{\text{e}}/M,&lt;/math&gt; is about 1/1836 (i.e. the electron-to-proton mass ratio). For deuterium and tritium, the ratios are about 1/3670 and 1/5497 respectively. These figures, when added to 1 in the denominator, represent very small corrections in the value of ''R'', and thus only small corrections to all energy levels in corresponding hydrogen isotopes.

There were still problems with Bohr's model: 
# it failed to predict other spectral details such as [[fine structure]] and [[hyperfine structure]]
# it could only predict energy levels with any accuracy for single–electron atoms (hydrogen–like atoms)
# the predicted values were only correct to &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 \approx 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fine-structure constant]].

Most of these shortcomings were repaired by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Arnold Sommerfeld's]] modification of the Bohr model. Sommerfeld introduced two additional degrees of freedom allowing an electron to move on an elliptical orbit, characterized by its [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[declination]] with respect to a chosen axis. This introduces two additional quantum numbers, which correspond to the orbital [[angular momentum]] and its projection on the chosen axis. Thus the correct multiplicity of states (except for the factor 2 accounting for the yet unknown electron spin) was found. Further applying special relativity theory to the elliptic orbits, Sommerfeld succeeded in deriving the correct expression for the fine structure of hydrogen spectra (which happens to be exactly the same as in the most elaborate Dirac theory). However some observed phenomena such as the anomalous [[Zeeman effect]] remain unexplained. These issues were resolved with the full development of quantum mechanics and the [[Dirac equation]]. It is often alleged, that the [[Schrödinger equation]] is superior to the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory in describing hydrogen atom. This is however not the case, as the most results of both approaches coincide or are very close (a remarkable exception is the problem of hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields, which cannot be solved in the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory self-consistently), and their main shortcomings result from the absence of the electron spin in both theories.  It was the complete failure of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory to explain many-electron systems (such as helium atom or hydrogen molecule) which demonstrated its inadequacy in describing quantum phenomena.

=== Schrödinger equation ===
The Schrödinger equation allows one to calculate the development of quantum systems with time and can give exact, analytical answers for the non-relativistic hydrogen atom.

==== Wavefunction ====
The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] of the hydrogen atom is the radial kinetic energy operator and coulomb attraction force between the positive proton and negative electron. Using the time-independent Schrödinger equation, ignoring all spin-coupling interactions and using the [[reduced mass]] &lt;math&gt;\mu=m_e M/(m_e + M)&lt;/math&gt;, the equation is written as:

&lt;math&gt;\left(- \frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu} \nabla^2  - \frac{  e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \right) \psi(r,\theta, \phi) = E \psi(r, \theta, \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the [[Laplace operator|Laplacian]] in spherical coordinates:

&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu} \left[ \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial }{\partial r} \left( r^2 \frac{ \partial \psi}{\partial r}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \phi^2} \right] - \frac{e^2}{ 4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \psi= E \psi&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[Separation of variables|separable]], [[partial differential equation]] which can be solved in terms of special functions.  The normalized position [[wavefunction]]s, given in [[spherical coordinates]] are:
::&lt;math&gt; \psi_{n\ell m}(r,\vartheta,\varphi) = \sqrt {{\left (  \frac{2}{n a^*_0} \right )}^3 \frac{(n-\ell-1)!}{2n(n+\ell)!}} e^{- \rho / 2} \rho^{\ell} L_{n-\ell-1}^{2\ell+1}(\rho) Y_{\ell}^{m}(\vartheta, \varphi ) &lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Hydrogen eigenstate n4 l3 m1.png|thumb|right|3D illustration of the eigenstate &lt;math&gt;\psi_{4,3,1}&lt;/math&gt;. Electrons in this state are 45% likely to be found within the solid body shown.]]
where:
::&lt;math&gt; \rho = {2r \over {n a^*_0}} &lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt; a^*_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Bohr radius]], &lt;math&gt;a^*_0={{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar^2}\over{\mu e^2}}&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt; L_{n-\ell-1}^{2\ell+1}(\rho) &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Laguerre polynomial#Generalized Laguerre polynomials|generalized Laguerre polynomial]] of degree {{nowrap|''n'' − ''ℓ'' − 1}}, and
::&lt;math&gt; Y_{\ell}^{m}(\vartheta, \varphi ) \,&lt;/math&gt; is a [[spherical harmonic]] function of degree ''ℓ'' and order ''m''. Note that the generalized Laguerre polynomials are defined differently by different authors. The usage here is consistent with the definitions used by Messiah,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Messiah|first=Albert|title=Quantum Mechanics|date=1999|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0-486-40924-4|pages=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mathematica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/LaguerreL.html LaguerreL]. Wolfram Mathematica page&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, the Laguerre polynomial includes a factor of &lt;math&gt;(n+\ell)!&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; or the generalized Laguerre polynomial appearing in the hydrogen wave function is &lt;math&gt; L_{n+\ell}^{2\ell+1}(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condon and Shortley|title=The Theory of Atomic Spectra|date=1963|publisher=Cambridge|location=London|pages=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum numbers can take the following values: 
::&lt;math&gt; n=1,2,3,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\ell=0,1,2,\ldots,n-1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;m=-\ell,\ldots,\ell.&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, these wavefunctions are ''normalized'' (i.e., the integral of their modulus square equals 1) and [[Orthogonal functions|orthogonal]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\infty} r^2 dr\int_0^{\pi} \sin \vartheta d\vartheta \int_0^{2 \pi} d\varphi\; \psi^*_{n\ell m}(r,\vartheta,\varphi)\psi_{n'\ell'm'}(r,\vartheta,\varphi)=\langle n,\ell, m | n', \ell', m' \rangle = \delta_{nn'} \delta_{\ell\ell'} \delta_{mm'},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;| n, \ell, m \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the state represented by the wavefunction &lt;math&gt; \psi_{n\ell m} &lt;/math&gt; in [[Dirac notation]], and &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] function.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Ch. 4 p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

The wavefunctions in momentum space are related to the wavefunctions in position space through a Fourier transform

::&lt;math&gt; \phi(p, \vartheta_p, \varphi_p) = (2\pi\hbar)^{-3/2} \int e^{-i \vec{p} \cdot \vec{r} / \hbar} \psi(r,\vartheta,\varphi) dV, &lt;/math&gt;

which, for the bound states, results in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

::&lt;math&gt; \phi(p, \vartheta_p, \varphi_p) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi} \frac{(n-l-1)!}{(n+l)!}} n^2 2^{2l+2} l! \frac{n^l p^l}{(n^2 p^2 + 1)^{l+2}} C_{n-l-1}^{l+1}\left(\frac{n^2 p^2 - 1}{n^2 p^2 + 1}\right) Y_l^m({\vartheta_p, \varphi_p}), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; C_N^\alpha(x) &lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[Gegenbauer polynomial]] and &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is in units of &lt;math&gt; \hbar/a^*_0 &lt;/math&gt;.

The solutions to the Schrödinger equation for hydrogen are [[analytical expression|analytical]], giving a simple expression for the hydrogen [[energy levels]] and thus the frequencies of the hydrogen [[spectral line]]s and fully reproduced the Bohr model and went beyond it. It also yields two other quantum numbers and the shape of the electron's wave function ("orbital") for the various possible quantum-mechanical states, thus explaining the [[anisotropic]] character of atomic bonds.

The Schrödinger equation also applies to more complicated atoms and [[molecule]]s. When there is more than one electron or nucleus the solution is not analytical and either computer calculations are necessary or simplifying assumptions must be made.

Since the Schrödinger equation is only valid for non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the solutions it yields for the hydrogen atom are not entirely correct. The [[Dirac equation]] of relativistic quantum theory improves these solutions (see below).

==== Results of Schrödinger equation ====
The solution of the Schrödinger equation (wave equation) for the hydrogen atom uses the fact that the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb potential]] produced by the nucleus is [[isotropic]] (it is radially symmetric in space and only depends on the distance to the nucleus). Although the resulting [[energy eigenfunctions]] (the ''orbitals'') are not necessarily isotropic themselves, their dependence on the [[Spherical coordinate system|angular coordinates]] follows completely generally from this isotropy of the underlying potential: the [[eigenstates]] of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] (that is, the energy eigenstates) can be chosen as simultaneous eigenstates of the [[angular momentum operator]]. This corresponds to the fact that angular momentum is conserved in the [[orbital motion (quantum)|orbital motion]] of the electron around the nucleus. Therefore, the energy eigenstates may be classified by two angular momentum [[quantum number]]s, ''ℓ'' and ''m'' (both are integers). The angular momentum quantum number {{nowrap|''ℓ'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, ...}} determines the magnitude of the angular momentum. The magnetic quantum number {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} −''ℓ'', ..., +''ℓ''}} determines the projection of the angular momentum on the (arbitrarily chosen) ''z''-axis.

In addition to mathematical expressions for total angular momentum and angular momentum projection of wavefunctions, an expression for the radial dependence of the wave functions must be found. It is only here that the details of the 1/''r'' Coulomb potential enter (leading to [[Laguerre polynomials]] in ''r''). This leads to a third quantum number, the principal quantum number {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3, ...}}. The principal quantum number in hydrogen is related to the atom's total energy.

Note that the maximum value of the angular momentum quantum number is limited by the principal quantum number: it can run only up to ''n'' − 1, i.e. {{nowrap|''ℓ'' {{=}} 0, 1, ..., ''n'' − 1}}.

Due to angular momentum conservation, states of the same ''ℓ'' but different ''m'' have the same energy (this holds for all problems with [[rotational symmetry]]). In addition, for the hydrogen atom, states of the same ''n'' but different ''ℓ'' are also [[degenerate energy levels|degenerate]] (i.e. they have the same energy). However, this is a specific property of hydrogen and is no longer true for more complicated atoms which have an (effective) potential differing from the form 1/''r'' (due to the presence of the inner electrons shielding the nucleus potential).

Taking into account the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the electron adds a last quantum number, the projection of the electron's spin angular momentum along the ''z''-axis, which can take on two values. Therefore, any [[eigenstate]] of the electron in the hydrogen atom is described fully by four quantum numbers. According to the usual rules of quantum mechanics, the actual state of the electron may be any [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of these states. This explains also why the choice of ''z''-axis for the directional [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of the angular momentum vector is immaterial: an orbital of given ''ℓ'' and ''m''&amp;prime; obtained for another preferred axis ''z''&amp;prime; can always be represented as a suitable superposition of the various states of different ''m'' (but same ''l'') that have been obtained for ''z''.

==== Mathematical summary of eigenstates of hydrogen atom ====
{{main|Hydrogen-like atom}}

In 1928, [[Paul Dirac]] found [[Dirac equation|an equation]] that was fully compatible with [[Special Relativity]], and (as a consequence) made the wave function a 4-component "[[Dirac spinor]]" including "up" and "down" spin components, with both positive and "negative" energy (or matter and antimatter). The solution to this equation gave the following results, more accurate than the Schrödinger solution.

=====Energy levels=====
The energy levels of hydrogen, including [[fine structure]] (excluding [[Lamb shift]] and [[hyperfine structure]]), are given by the [[Fine-structure constant|Sommerfeld fine structure]] expression:&lt;ref name="Sommerfeld"&gt;{{cite book|first=Arnold |last= Sommerfeld|title=Atombau und Spektrallinien'|  publisher=Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn|location=Braunschweig|year=1919|isbn=3-87144-484-7}} [https://archive.org/stream/atombauundspekt00sommgoog German] [https://archive.org/details/AtomicStructureAndSpectralLines English]&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl} E_{j\,n} &amp; = -\mu c^2\left[1-\left(1+\left[\dfrac{\alpha}{n-j-\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{\left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)^2-\alpha^2}}\right]^2\right)^{-1/2}\right] \\ &amp; \approx -\dfrac{\mu c^2\alpha^2}{2n^2} \left[1 + \dfrac{\alpha^2}{n^2}\left(\dfrac{n}{j+\frac{1}{2}} - \dfrac{3}{4} \right) \right] , \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' is the [[fine-structure constant]] and ''j'' is the "total angular momentum" [[quantum number]], which is equal to |''ℓ'' ± {{sfrac|1|2}}| depending on the direction of the electron spin. This formula represents a small correction to the energy obtained by Bohr and Schrödinger as given above. The factor in square brackets in the last expression is nearly one; the extra term arises from relativistic effects (for details, see [[#Features going beyond the Schrödinger solution]]). It is worth noting that this expression was first obtained by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|A. Sommerfeld]] in 1916 based on the relativistic version of the [[Old quantum theory|old Bohr theory]]. Sommerfeld has however used different notation for the quantum numbers.

=== Visualizing the hydrogen electron orbitals ===
{{main|Atomic orbital}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|frame|Probability densities through the ''xz''-plane for the electron at different quantum numbers (''ℓ'', across top; ''n'', down side; ''m'' = 0)]]
The image to the right shows the first few hydrogen atom orbitals (energy eigenfunctions). These are cross-sections of the [[probability amplitude|probability density]] that are color-coded (black represents zero density and white represents the highest density). The angular momentum (orbital) quantum number ''ℓ'' is denoted in each column, using the usual spectroscopic letter code (''s'' means ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''p'' means ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''d'' means ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2). The main (principal) quantum number ''n'' (= 1, 2, 3, ...) is marked to the right of each row. For all pictures the magnetic quantum number ''m'' has been set to 0, and the cross-sectional plane is the ''xz''-plane (''z'' is the vertical axis). The probability density in three-dimensional space is obtained by rotating the one shown here around the ''z''-axis.

The "[[ground state]]", i.e. the state of lowest energy, in which the electron is usually found, is the first one, the 1''s'' state ([[principal quantum level]] ''n'' = 1, ''ℓ'' = 0).

Black lines occur in each but the first orbital: these are the nodes of the wavefunction, i.e. where the probability density is zero.  (More precisely, the nodes are [[spherical harmonics]] that appear as a result of solving [[Schrödinger equation]] in polar coordinates.)

The [[quantum number]]s determine the layout of these nodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.byu.edu/faculty/durfee/courses/Summer2009/physics222/AtomicQuantumNumbers.pdf Summary of atomic quantum numbers]. Lecture notes. 28 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There are:
* &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; total nodes,
* &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; of which are angular nodes:
** &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; angular nodes go around the &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; axis (in the xy plane). &lt;small&gt;(The figure above does not show these nodes since it plots cross-sections through the xz-plane.)&lt;/small&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;l-m&lt;/math&gt; (the remaining angular nodes) occur on the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (vertical) axis.
* &lt;math&gt;n - l - 1&lt;/math&gt; (the remaining non-angular nodes) are radial nodes.

==== Features going beyond the Schrödinger solution ====
There are several important effects that are neglected by the Schrödinger equation and which are responsible for certain small but measurable deviations of the real spectral lines from the predicted ones:

* Although the mean speed of the electron in hydrogen is only 1/137th of the [[speed of light]], many modern experiments are sufficiently precise that a complete theoretical explanation requires a fully relativistic treatment of the problem. A relativistic treatment results in a momentum increase of about 1 part in 37,000 for the electron. Since the electron's wavelength is determined by its momentum, orbitals containing higher speed electrons show contraction due to smaller wavelengths.
* Even when there is no external [[magnetic field]], in the [[inertial frame]] of the moving electron, the electromagnetic field of the nucleus has a magnetic component. The spin of the electron has an associated [[magnetic moment]] which interacts with this magnetic field. This effect is also explained by special relativity, and it leads to the so-called ''[[spin-orbit coupling]]'', i.e., an interaction between the [[electron]]'s [[orbital motion (quantum)|orbital motion]] around the nucleus, and its [[spin (physics)|spin]].

Both of these features (and more) are incorporated in the relativistic [[Dirac equation]], with predictions that come still closer to experiment. Again the Dirac equation may be solved analytically in the special case of a two-body system, such as the hydrogen atom. The resulting solution quantum states now must be classified by the [[Total angular momentum quantum number|total angular momentum number]] ''j'' (arising through the coupling between [[electron spin]] and [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]]). States of the same ''j'' and the same ''n'' are still degenerate. Thus, direct analytical solution of [[Dirac equation]] predicts 2S({{sfrac|1|2}}) and 2P({{sfrac|1|2}}) levels of Hydrogen to have exactly the same energy, which is in a contradiction with observations ([[Lamb shift|Lamb-Retherford experiment]]).

* There are always [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s of the [[electromagnetic field]], according to quantum mechanics. Due to such fluctuations degeneracy between states of the same j but different l is lifted, giving them slightly different energies. This has been demonstrated in the famous [[Lamb shift|Lamb-Retherford experiment]] and was the starting point for the development of the theory of [[Quantum electrodynamics]] (which is able to deal with these vacuum fluctuations and employs the famous [[Feynman diagram]]s for approximations using [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]). This effect is now called [[Lamb shift]].

For these developments, it was essential that the solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom could be worked out exactly, such that any experimentally observed deviation had to be taken seriously as a signal of failure of the theory.

{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Subseries}}
An '''ideology''' is a collection of [[normative]] [[beliefs]] and [[values]] that an individual or group holds for other than purely [[epistemic]] reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Honderich |first1=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |date=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866132-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by [[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]] in 1796, who conceived it as the "science of ideas". In contemporary philosophy it is narrower in scope than that original concept, or the ideas expressed in broad concepts such as ''[[worldview]]'', ''[[imaginary (sociology)|imaginary]]'' and ''[[ontology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |last1=Steger |first1=Manfred B. |last2=James |first2=Paul |authorlink2=Paul James (academic) |title=Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies |url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113 |journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology |volume=12 |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the political world, for instance, there are many well-known [[List of political ideologies|political ideologies]], which cover a wide range of human interests.

In the sense defined by French Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]], ideology is "the imagined existence (or idea) of things as it relates to the real conditions of existence".

==Etymology and history==
[[File:Destutt de Tracy.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]] (1754-1836)]]
The term "ideology" was born during the [[Reign of Terror]] of [[French Revolution]], and acquired several other meanings thereafter.

The word, and the system of ideas associated with it, was coined by [[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]] in 1796,&lt;ref name = hart&gt;{{cite web|last = Hart|first = David M. |date = 1 January 2002|url = http://www.econlib.org/library/Tracy/DestuttdeTracyBio.html |title = Life and Works of Antoine Louis Claude, Comte Destutt de Tracy|website = Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he was in prison pending trial during the Terror. The word was created by assembling the words [[idea#John Locke|''idea'']], from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἰδέα|ἰδέα]]}} (near to the [[John Locke|Lockean]] sense) and ''[[-logy]]'', from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}}.

The coup that overthrew [[Maximilien Robespierre]] allowed Tracy to pursue his work.&lt;ref name = kennedy&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=Emmet |date=Jul–Sep 1979 |title="Ideology" from Destutt De Tracy to Marx |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=353–368 |jstor=2709242 |doi=10.2307/2709242|bibcode=1961JHI....22..215C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hart/&gt;

Tracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob impulses that had nearly destroyed him.  He devised the term for a "science of ideas" he hoped would form a secure foundation for the moral and political sciences. He based the word on two things:  1) sensations people experience as they interact with the material world; and 2) the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations. He conceived "Ideology" as a [[liberalism|liberal]] philosophy that would defend individual liberty, property,  [[free markets]], and constitutional limits on state power.  He argues that among these aspects ideology is the most generic term, because the science of ideas also contains the study of their expression and deduction.&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt;

Tracy worked this out during the Napoleonic regime, and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] came to view 'Ideology' a term of abuse, which he often hurled against his liberal foes in Tracy's [[Institut National]]. According to [[Karl Mannheim]]'s historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of ideology, the modern meaning of the word was born when Napoleon used it to describe his opponents as "the ideologues". [[Karl Marx]] adopted this negative sense of the term and used it in his writings (he described Tracy as a "fischblütige Bourgeoisdoktrinär", a fishblooded bourgeois doctrinaire).&lt;ref&gt;De Tracy, Destutt (1801) ''Les Éléments d'idéologie'', 3rd ed. (1817), p. 4, cited by: Mannheim, Karl (1929) Ideologie und Utopie, 2nd footnote in the chapter ''The problem of "false consciousness"''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy's major book, ''[[The Elements of Ideology]]'', was soon translated into the major languages of Europe, and in the next generation, when post-Napoleonic governments adopted a reactionary stance, influenced the Italian, Spanish and Russian thinkers who had begun to describe themselves as "liberals" and who attempted to reignite revolutionary activity in the early 1820s (these included the Carlist rebels in Spain, the Carbonari societies in France and Italy, and the Decembrists in Russia).

In the century after Tracy, the term ideology moved back and forth between positive and negative connotations.

(Perhaps the most accessible source for the near-original meaning of ''ideology'' is [[Hippolyte Taine]]'s work on the [[Ancien Régime]] (the first volume of "Origins of Contemporary France"). He describes ideology as rather like teaching philosophy by the [[Socratic method]], but without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed, and without the examples from observation that practical science would require. Taine identifies it not just with Destutt De Tracy, but also with his milieu, and includes [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]] as one of its precursors. (Destutt de Tracy read the works of Locke and Condillac while he was imprisoned during the [[Reign of Terror]].))

The term "ideology" has [[Euphemism#Euphemism treadmill|dropped some of its pejorative sting]], and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry (1991) ''Ideology. An introduction'', Verso, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Karl Marx]] situated the term within [[class struggle]] and domination,&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Robert C (1978). ''The Marx-Engels Reader'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''MER'', pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt; others believed it was a necessary part of [[structural functionalism|institutional functioning]] and [[social cohesion|social integration]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Silbey, [http://www.credoreference.com/entry/cupsoc/ideology "Ideology"] at ''Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
There has been considerable analysis of different ideological patterns. Some have described this kind of analysis as ''meta-ideology''—the study of the structure, form, and manifestation of ideologies. Recent analysis tends to posit that ideology is a ''coherent system of ideas'' that rely on a few basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis. Ideas become ideologies (that is, become coherent, repeated patterns) through the subjective ongoing choices that people make, serving as the seed around which further thought grows. According to most recent analysis, ideologies are neither necessarily right nor wrong. Believers in ideology range from passive acceptance through fervent advocacy to true belief.

This accords with definitions, such as by [[Manfred Steger]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], that emphasize both the issue of patterning and contingent claims to truth:

{{quote|Ideologies are patterned clusters of normatively imbued ideas and concepts, including particular representations of power relations. These conceptual maps help people navigate the complexity of their political universe and carry claims to social truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2010 |last1=James |first1=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |last2=Steger |first2=Manfred |title=Globalization and Culture, Vol. 4: Ideologies of Globalism |url=https://www.academia.edu/4510893 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The works of George Walford and Harold Walsby, done under the heading of [[systematic ideology]], are attempts to explore the relationships between ideology and social systems. [[Charles Blattberg]] offers an account that distinguishes political ideologies from political philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Blattberg, Charles, "Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies", in ''Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy'', Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1755117]&lt;/ref&gt;

David W. Minar describes six different ways the word "ideology" has been used:
# As a collection of certain ideas with certain kinds of ''content'', usually normative
# As the ''form or internal logical structure'' that ideas have within a set
# By the role ideas play in ''human-social interaction''
# By the role ideas play in the ''structure of an organization''
# As meaning, whose purpose is ''persuasion''
# As the ''locus'' of social interaction

For Willard A. Mullins an ideology should be contrasted with the related (but different) issues of ''utopia'' and ''historical myth''. An ideology is composed of four basic characteristics:
# it must have power over cognition
# it must be capable of guiding one's evaluations;
# it must provide guidance towards action; and
# it must be logically coherent.

[[Terry Eagleton]] outlines (more or less in no particular order) some definitions of ideology:&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry (1991) ''Ideology: An Introduction'', Verso, {{ISBN|0-86091-319-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The process of production of meanings, signs and values in social life
# A body of ideas characteristic of a particular social group or class
# Ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power
# False ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power
# Systematically distorted communication
# Ideas that offer a position for a subject
# Forms of thought motivated by social interests
# Identity thinking
# Socially necessary illusion
# The conjuncture of discourse and power
# The medium in which conscious social actors make sense of their world
# Action-oriented sets of beliefs
# The confusion of linguistic and phenomenal reality
# Semiotic closure
# The indispensable medium in which individuals live out their relations to a social structure
# The process that converts social life to a natural reality

The German philosopher [https://web.archive.org/web/20110701015904/http://www.ideologieforschung.de/web/Christian_Duncker.html Christian Duncker] called for a "critical reflection of the ideology concept" (2006). In his work, he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground, as well as the closely connected concerns of [[epistemology]] and history. In this work, the term ideology is defined in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly claim to absolute truth.

There are many different kinds of ideologies: [[politics|political]], [[Social issues|social]], [[epistemological]], and [[ethics|ethical]].

===Marxist view===
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Karl Marx]] posits that a society's dominant ideology is integral to its superstructure.]]
In the [[Marxist]] [[base and superstructure (Marxism)|economic base and superstructure]] model of society, ''base'' denotes the [[relations of production]] and [[modes of production]], and ''superstructure'' denotes the dominant ideology (religious, legal, political systems). The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology—actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a [[feudal]] [[mode of production]], religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure, while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as [[liberalism]] and [[social democracy]] dominate. Hence the great importance of the ideology justifying a society; it politically confuses the alienated groups of society via [[false consciousness]].

Some explanations have been presented. [[György Lukács]] proposes ideology as a [[psychological projection|projection]] of the [[class consciousness]] of the ruling class. [[Antonio Gramsci]] uses [[cultural hegemony]] to explain why the [[working-class]] have a false ideological conception of what are their best interests. Marx argued that "The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title="The Civil War in France", The Marx-Engels Reader 2nd ed.|year=1978a|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marxist formulation of "ideology as an instrument of social reproduction" is conceptually important to the [[sociology of knowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;In this discipline, there are lexical disputes over the meaning of the word "ideology" ("false consciousness" as advocated by Marx, or rather "false position" of a statement in itself is correct but irrelevant in the context in which it is produced, as in [[Max Weber]]'s opinion): {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Eleggibilità più ampia senza i paletti del peculato d'uso? Un'occasione (perduta) per affrontare il tema delle leggi ad personam |journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia Edizione Online |date=2005| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89394794}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; viz. [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Daniel Bell]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] et al. Moreover, Mannheim has developed, and progressed, from the "total" but "special" Marxist conception of ideology to a "general" and "total" ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology (including [[Marxism]]) resulted from social life, an idea developed by the [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. [[Slavoj Žižek]] and the earlier [[Frankfurt School]] added to the "general theory" of ideology a psychoanalytic insight that ideologies do not include only conscious, but also [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] ideas.

===Louis Althusser's ideological state apparatuses===
[[Louis Althusser]] proposed both spiritual and materialistic conception of ideology, which made use of a special type of discourse: the [[lacunar discourse]]. A number of propositions, which are never untrue, suggest a number of other propositions, which are. In this way, the essence of the lacunar discourse is what is ''not'' told (but is suggested).

For example, the statement "All are equal before the law," which is a theoretical groundwork of current legal systems, suggests that all people may be of equal worth or have equal "opportunities". This is not true, for the concept of [[private property]] and power over the [[means of production]] results in some people being able to own more (''much'' more) than others. This power disparity contradicts the claim that all share both practical worth and future opportunity equally; for example, the rich can afford better legal representation, which practically privileges them before the law.

Althusser also proffered the concept of the [[ideological state apparatus]] to explain his theory of ideology. His first thesis was "''ideology has no history''": while individual ideolog''ies'' have histories, interleaved with the general class struggle of society, the general form of ideology is external to history.

For Althusser, beliefs and ideas are the products of social practices, not the reverse. His thesis that "''ideas are material''" is illustrated by the "scandalous advice" of [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] toward unbelievers: "Kneel and pray, and then you will believe." What is ultimately ideological for Althusser are not the subjective beliefs held in the conscious "minds" of human individuals, but rather discourses that produce these beliefs, the material institutions and rituals that individuals take part in without submitting it to conscious examination and so much more [[critical thinking]].

===Ideology and the Commodity in the works of Guy Debord===
The French [[Marxist]] theorist [[Guy Debord]], founding member of the [[Situationist International]], argued that when the commodity becomes the "essential category" of society, i.e. when the process of [[commodification]] has been consummated to its fullest extent, the image of society propagated by the commodity (as it describes all of life as constituted by notions and objects deriving their value only as commodities tradeable in terms of [[exchange value]]), colonizes all of life and reduces society to a mere representation, [[The Society of the Spectacle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Society of the Spectacle|publisher=Zone Books|author=Guy Debord|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silvio Vietta: ideology and rationality===
{{Disputed section|date=July 2015}}
The German [[cultural historian]] [[Silvio Vietta]] described the development and expansion of Western rationality from ancient times onwards as often accompanied by and shaped by ideologies like that of the "just war", the "true religion", racism, nationalism, or the vision of future history as a kind of heaven on earth in communism. He said that ideas like these became ideologies by giving hegemonic political actions an idealistic veneer and equipping their leaders with a higher and, in the "[[political religion]]s" ([[Eric Voegelin]]), nearly God-like power, so that they became masters over the lives (and the deaths) of millions of people. He considered that ideologies therefore contributed to power politics irrational shields of ideas beneath which they could operate as manifestations of idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Theory of Global Civilization: Rationality and the Irrational as the Driving Forces of History|publisher=Kindle Ebooks|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rationalität. Eine Weltgeschichte. Europäische Kulturgeschichte und Globalisierung|publisher=Fink|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eric Hoffer:  unifying agents===
The American philosopher [[Eric Hoffer]] identified several elements that unify followers of a particular ideology:&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 91 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
1) Hatred:  "Mass movements can rise and spread without a God, but never without belief in a devil.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "ideal devil" is a foreigner.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

2) Imitation:  "The less satisfaction we derive from being ourselves, the greater is our desire to be like others ... the more we mistrust our judgment and luck, the more are we ready to follow the example of others."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 101-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

3) Persuasion:  The proselytizing zeal of propagandists derives from "a passionate search for something not yet found more than a desire to bestow something we already have."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

4) Coercion:  Hoffer asserts that violence and fanaticism are interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  People forcibly converted to Islamic or communist beliefs become as fanatical as those who did the forcing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  "It takes fanatical faith to rationalize our cowardice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

5) Leadership:  Without the leader, there is no movement.  Often the leader must wait long in the wings until the time is ripe.  He calls for sacrifices in the present, to justify his vision of a breathtaking future.  The skills required include:  audacity, brazenness, iron will, fanatical conviction; passionate hatred, cunning, a delight in symbols; ability to inspire blind faith in the masses and a group of able lieutenants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 112-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlatanism is indispensable, and the leader often imitates both friend and foe, "a single-minded fashioning after a model."  He will not lead followers towards the "promised land," but only "away from their unwanted selves."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 116-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

6) Action:  Original thoughts are suppressed, and unity encouraged, if the masses are kept occupied through great projects, marches, exploration and industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 120-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

7) Suspicion:  "There is prying and spying, tense watching and a tense awareness of being watched."  This pathological mistrust goes unchallenged and encourages conformity, not dissent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ronald Inglehart===

[[Ronald Inglehart]] of the University of Michigan is author of the [[World Values Survey]], which, since 1980, has mapped social attitudes in 100 countries representing 90% of global population. Results indicate that where people live is likely to closely correlate with their ideological beliefs. In much of Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, people prefer traditional beliefs and are less tolerant of liberal values. Protestant Europe, at the other extreme, adheres more to secular beliefs and liberal values. Alone among high-income countries, the United States is exceptional in its adherence to traditional beliefs, in this case Christianity.

==Political ideologies==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Charles de Gaulle]]--&gt;
{{See also|List of political ideologies}}
In [[social studies]], a political ideology is a certain ethical set of [[ideal (ethics)|ideals]], principles, [[doctrine]]s, [[mythology|myths]], or [[symbol]]s of a [[social movement]], [[institution]], [[social class|class]], or large group that explains how society should work, and offers some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society, including (for example): the economy, [[education]], [[health care]], [[labor law]], [[criminal law]], the [[justice system]], the provision of [[social security]] and [[social welfare]], [[trade]], the [[environmentalism|environment]], [[minor (law)|minors]], [[immigration]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], use of the [[military]], [[patriotism]], and [[established religion]].

Political ideologies have two dimensions:
# Goals: how society should work
# Methods: the most appropriate ways to achieve the ideal arrangement

There are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies, each of these different methods generate a specific [[political spectrum]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Ideologies also identify themselves by their position on the [[political spectrum]] (such as the [[left-wing politics|left]], the [[center (politics)|center]] or the [[right-wing politics|right]]), though precision in this respect can very often become controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from [[political strategy|political strategies]] (e.g., [[populism]]) and from single issues that a party may be built around (e.g. [[Marijuana political parties|legalization of marijuana]]). Philosopher Michael Oakeshott provides a good definition of ideology as "the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub-stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition".

A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate [[power (sociology)|power]] and to what ends power should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. Each political ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers the best [[form of government]] (e.g., [[democracy]], [[demagogy]], [[theocracy]], [[caliphate]] etc.), and the best [[economic system]] (e.g. [[capitalism]], [[socialism]], etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, "socialism" may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology that supports that economic system.

Studies of the concept of ideology itself (rather than specific ideologies) have been carried out under the name of [[systematic ideology]].

Post 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bell|Bell, D.]] ''[[The End of Ideology|The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties]] (2000) (2nd ed.). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, pg. 393''&lt;/ref&gt; in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed, and this view is often associated{{by whom|date=August 2015}} with [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s writings on "the end of history".&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, F. (1992)''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. USA: The Free Press, xi&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Nienhueser sees research (in the field of [[human resource management]]) as ongoingly "generating ideology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nienhueser |first1=Werner |year=2011 |title=Empirical Research on Human Resource Management as a Production of Ideology |url=http://www.management-revue.org/papers/mrev_4_11_Nienhueser.pdf |journal=Management Revue |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=367–393 |doi=10.1688/1861-9908_mrev_2011_04_Nienhueser |issn=0935-9915 |access-date=2015-08-27 |quote=[...] current empirical research in HRM is generating ideology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavoj Zizek]] has pointed out how the very notion of post-ideology can enable the deepest, blindest form of ideology. A sort of false consciousness or false cynicism, engaged in for the purpose of lending one's point of view the respect of being objective, pretending neutral cynicism, without truly being so. Rather than help avoiding ideology, this lapse only deepens the commitment to an existing one. Zizek calls this "a post-modernist trap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zizek |first=Slavoj |date=2008 |title=The Sublime Object of Ideology |edition=2nd |publisher=[[London: Verso]]|pages =xxxi, 25–27 |isbn=9781844673001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Sloterdijk]] advanced the same idea already in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sloterdijk |first=Peter |date=1988 |title=Critique of Cynical Reason |publisher=[[US: University of Minnesota Press]] |isbn=9780816615865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government ideology===
When a political ideology becomes a dominantly pervasive component within a government, one can speak of an [[ideocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Politics_of_ideocracy.html?id=xC6FAAAAMAAJ |title=Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz, Alfred Wayne Penn. Politics of Ideocracy|isbn=9780791422977|last1=Piekalkiewicz|first1=Jaroslaw|last2=Penn|first2=Alfred Wayne|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of government utilize ideology in various ways, not always restricted to politics and society. Certain ideas and schools of thought become favored, or rejected, over others, depending on their compatibility with or use for the reigning social order.

===Implementation===

"Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back", said [[John Maynard Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;The General Theory, p383-4&lt;/ref&gt; How do ideologies become part of government policy?
In ''[[The Anatomy of Revolution]]'', [[Crane Brinton]] said that new ideology spreads when there is discontent with the old regime.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Extremists such as [[Lenin]] and [[Robespierre]] will overcome more moderate revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, CH 6&lt;/ref&gt;  This stage is soon followed by [[Thermidor]], a reining back of revolutionary enthusiasm under pragmatists like [[Stalin]] and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] who bring "normalcy and equilibrium".&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, CH 8&lt;/ref&gt;
A very similar sequence  ("men of ideas&gt;fanatics&gt;practical men of action") occurs in [[Eric Hoffer]], [[The True Believer]],&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, chapters 15, 16,17&lt;/ref&gt; and Brinton's sequence is reiterated by [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbright, The Arrogance of Power, 1967, chapters 3-7&lt;/ref&gt;
The revolution thus becomes established as an [[Ideocracy]], but its rise is likely to be checked by a [[Political midlife crisis]].

==Epistemological ideologies==
Even when the challenging of existing beliefs is encouraged, as in scientific theories, the dominant [[paradigm]] or [[mindset]] can prevent certain challenges, theories, or experiments from being advanced.

A special case of science adopted as ideology is that of ecology, which studies the relationships among living things on Earth. [[Perceptual psychology|Perceptual psychologist]] [[James J. Gibson]] believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]] itself. [[Linguistics|Linguist]] [[George Lakoff]] has proposed a [[cognitive science of mathematics]] wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception—which is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology.

[[Deep ecology]] and the modern [[ecology movement]] (and, to a lesser degree, [[Green parties]]) appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology.

Some accuse [[ecological economics]] of likewise turning scientific theory into [[political economy]], although theses in that science can often be tested. The modern practice of [[green economics]] fuses both approaches and seems to be part science, part ideology.

This is far from the only theory of economics raised to ideology status. Some notable economically based ideologies include [[neoliberalism]], [[monetarism]], [[mercantilism]], [[mixed economy]], [[social Darwinism]], [[communism]], [[laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]], and [[free trade]]. There are also current theories of [[safe trade]] and [[fair trade]] that can be seen as ideologies.

==Psychological research==
Psychological research&lt;ref name="jost2008"/&gt; increasingly suggests that ideologies reflect (unconscious) motivational processes, as opposed to the view that political convictions always reflect independent and unbiased thinking. Jost, Ledgerwood and Hardin proposed in 2008 that ideologies may function as prepackaged units of interpretation that spread because of basic human motives to understand the world, avoid existential threat, and maintain valued interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="jost2008"&gt;Jost, John T., Ledgerwood, Alison, &amp; Hardin, Curtis D. (2008). "Shared reality, system justification, and the relational basis of ideological beliefs." ''Social and Personality Psychology Compass'', 2, 171–186&lt;/ref&gt; These authors conclude that such motives may lead disproportionately to the adoption of [[system justification|system-justifying]] worldviews. Psychologists have generally found that [[personality traits]], individual difference variables, needs, and ideological beliefs seem to have a common thread.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Ideology and semiotic theory==
According to the semiotician [[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]], ideology "identifies a unitary object that incorporates complex sets of meanings with the social agents and processes that produced them. No other term captures this object as well as 'ideology'. [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s '[[episteme]]' is too narrow and abstract, not social enough. His 'discourse', popular because it covers some of ideology's terrain with less baggage, is too confined to verbal systems. 'Worldview' is too metaphysical, 'propaganda' too loaded. Despite or because of its contradictions, 'ideology' still plays a key role in semiotics oriented to social, political life."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]], [http://www.semioticon.com/seo/I/ideology.html# "Ideology"], at ''Semiotics Encyclopedia Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as [[Michael Freeden]] have also recently incorporated a [[semantics|semantic]] analysis to the study of ideologies.

== Sociological uses ==
Sociologists define ideology as "cultural beliefs that justify particular social arrangements, including patterns of inequality."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology|last=Macionis|first=John J.|date=2010|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780205749898|edition=13th|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|pages=257|oclc=468109511}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dominant groups use these sets of cultural beliefs and practices to justify the systems of inequality that maintain their group's social power over non-dominant groups. Ideologies use a society's symbol system to organize social relations in a [[hierarchy]], with some social identities being superior to other social identities, which are considered inferior. The dominant ideology in a society is passed along through the society's major social institutions, such as the media, the family, education, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=MCGRAW-HILL|year=2017|isbn=978-1259702723|edition=5TH|location=[S.l.]|pages=65|oclc=968304061}}&lt;/ref&gt; As societies changed throughout history, so did the ideologies that justified systems of inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sociological examples of ideologies include: [[racism]]; [[sexism]]; [[heterosexism]]; [[ableism]]; and [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=John|publisher=MCGRAW-HILL|year=2017|isbn=978-1259702723|edition=5TH|location=[S.l.]|pages=|oclc=968304061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4064">In [[mathematics]], an '''induced homomorphism''' is a structure-preserving [[map (mathematics)|map]] between a pair of objects that is derived in a canonical way from another map between another pair of objects.

==In topology==
A particularly important case arises in [[algebraic topology]], where any [[continuous function]] between two [[Pointed space|pointed topological space]]s induces a [[group homomorphism]] between the [[fundamental group]]s of the two spaces. (See section III.5.4, p.&amp;nbsp;201, in H. Schubert.)
&lt;ref name="Sb"&gt;
{{cite book|
author=Schubert, H.|
year=1975| 
title=Topologie, Eine Einführung (Mathematische Leitfäden)|
publisher=B. G. Teubner Verlagsgesellschaft, Stuttgart}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, the same continuous map induces a group homomorphism between the respective [[homotopy group]]s, the respective [[homology group]]s (IV.1.3, pp.&amp;nbsp;240–241) &lt;ref name="Sb"/&gt; and a homomorphism going in the opposite direction between the corresponding [[cohomology group]]s (IV.4.2–3, pp.&amp;nbsp;298–299).&lt;ref name="Sb"/&gt;

==Categorization==
A [[homomorphism]] is a structure-preserving map between two mathematical objects of the same type: a [[group homomorphism]], for instance, is a map between two [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] such that the image of the product of any two group items is the same as the product of their images, while a [[graph homomorphism]] is a map from the vertices of one [[undirected graph]] to the vertices of another such that any edge of the first graph is mapped to an edge of the second. Families of objects, and maps between them, are generally formalized as [[object (category theory)|object]]s and [[morphism]]s in a [[category theory|category]]; by convention, the morphisms in categories are depicted as arrows in diagrams. In many of the
important categories of mathematics, the morphisms are called homomorphisms. In category theory, a [[functor]] is itself a structure-preserving map, between categories: it must map objects to objects, and morphisms to morphisms, in a way that is compatible with the composition of morphisms within the category. 
&lt;ref name="Pa"&gt;
{{cite book|
author=Pareigis, B.|
year=1969| 
title=Kategorien und Funktoren (Mathematische Leitfäden)|
publisher=B. G. Teubner Verlagsgesellschaft, Stuttgart}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
If ''F'' is a functor from category ''A'' to category ''B'', ƒ is a morphism in category ''A'', and the morphisms of category ''B'' are called homomorphisms, then ''F''(ƒ) is the homomorphism induced from ƒ by ''F''.

==Examples==
For example, let ''X'' and ''Y'' be topological spaces with fundamental groups π(''X'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and π(''Y'',''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) respectively, with specified [[pointed space|base points]] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. If ƒ is a continuous function from ''X'' to ''Y'' that maps the base points to each other (that is, ƒ(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) then any [[Loop group|loop]] based at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; may be composed with ƒ to make a loop based at ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This map of loops respects [[homotopy equivalence]] of loops: one can map any element of π(''X'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) to π(''Y'',''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) by choosing a loop representing the element, using ƒ to map that representative loop to ''Y'', and selecting the homotopy equivalence class of the resulting mapped loop. Thus, ƒ corresponds to a homomorphism of fundamental groups; this homomorphism is called the induced homomorphism of ƒ. 
&lt;ref name="Sb"/&gt;
The construction of a fundamental group for each topological space, and of an induced homomorphism of fundamental groups for each continuous function, forms a functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of groups. See [[fundamental group#Functoriality]] for more on this type of induced homomorphism.

In [[sociology]] and [[social psychology]], an '''ingroup''' is a [[social group]] to which a person [[self-categorization theory|psychologically identifies]] as being a member. By contrast, an '''outgroup''' is a social group with which an individual does not identify. For example, people may find it psychologically meaningful to view themselves according to their [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[culture]], [[gender]], age, or [[religion]]. It has been found that the psychological membership of social groups and categories is associated with a wide variety of phenomena.

The terminology was made popular by [[Henri Tajfel]] and colleagues during his work in formulating [[social identity theory]]. The significance of ingroup and outgroup categorization was identified using a method called the [[minimal group paradigm]]. Tajfel and colleagues found that people can form self-preferencing ingroups within a matter of minutes and that such groups can form even on the basis of completely arbitrary and invented discriminatory characteristics, such as preferences for certain paintings.&lt;ref&gt;See "Kandinsky versus Klee experiment", [[Henri Tajfel|Tajfel]] ''[[et al.]]'' (1971) in [http://www.holah.karoo.net/tajfestudy.htm Tajfel, H.

==Associated phenomena==
The psychological categorization of people into ingroup and outgroup members is associated with a variety of phenomena. The following examples have all received a great deal of academic attention.

===In-group favoritism===
{{Main article|In-group favoritism}}
This refers to the fact that under certain conditions, people will prefer and have affinity for one’s ingroup over the outgroup, or anyone viewed as outside the ingroup. This can be expressed in one's evaluation of others, linking, allocation of resources, and many other ways.&lt;ref name=aronson&gt;{{cite book |title=Social psychology |author=[[Elliot Aronson|Aronson, E.]], [[Timothy Wilson|Wilson, T. D.]], Akert, R. D. &amp; Sommers, S. R.|year=2015|publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIVHrgEACAAJ| edition=9th, illustrated, revised|id={{ISBN|978-0-133-93654-4}} | isbn=0-13393654-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outgroup derogation===
Discrimination between ingroups and outgroups is a matter of favoritism towards an ingroup and the absence of equivalent favoritism towards an outgroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brewer|first=Marilynn B.|authorlink=Marilynn Brewer|title=The Psychology of Prejudice: Ingroup Love and Outgroup Hate?|journal=[[Journal of Social Issues]]|date=Fall 1999|volume=55|issue=3|pages=429–444|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outgroup derogation is the phenomenon in which an outgroup is perceived as being threatening to the members of an ingroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hewstone|first1=Miles|authorlink1=Miles Hewstone |last2=Rubin|first2=Mark|last3=Willis|first3=Hazel|title=Intergroup Bias|date=February 2002|journal=[[Annual Review of Psychology]] | pages=575–604 |volume=53|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135109|pmid=11752497}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon often accompanies ingroup favoritism, as it requires one to have an affinity towards their ingroup. Some research suggests that outgroup derogation occurs when an outgroup is perceived as blocking or hindering the goals of an ingroup. It has also been argued that outgroup derogation is a natural consequence of the categorization process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Chen-Bo|last2=Phillips|first2=Katherine W.|last3=Leonardelli|first3=Geoffrey J.|last4=Galinsky|first4=Adam D.|title=Negational categorization and intergroup behavior|journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]|year=2008|volume=34|issue=6|pages=793–806|pmid=18391025|doi=10.1177/0146167208315457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social influence===
{{Main article|Social influence}}
People have been shown to be differentially influenced by ingroup members. That is, under conditions where group categorization is psychologically salient, people will shift their beliefs in line with ingroup [[Norm (social)|social norms]].

===Group polarization===
{{Main article|Group polarization}}
This generally refers to the tendency of groups to make decisions that are more extreme than the initial inclination of its members, although polarization toward the most central beliefs has also been observed. It has been shown that this effect is related to a psychologically salient ingroup and outgroup categorization.

===Group homogeneity===
{{Main article|Outgroup homogeneity}}
Categorization of people into social groups increases the perception that group members are similar to one another. An outcome of this is the outgroup homogeneity effect. This refers to the perception of members of an outgroup as being homogenous, while members of one's ingroup are perceived as being diverse, e.g. "they are alike; we are diverse”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leyens|first1=Jacques-Philippe|last2=Yzerbyt|first2=Vincent|last3=Schadron|first3=Georges|title=Stereotypes and Social Cognition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_SO3AAAAIAAJ|year=1994|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] |isbn=0-80398583-5 |id={{ISBN|978-0-803-98583-4}}|pages=104–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quattrone &amp; Jones (1980)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quattrone|first1=George A.|last2=Jones|first2=Edward E.|title=The perception of variability within in-groups and out-groups: Implications for the law of small numbers.|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|volume=38|issue=1|year=1980|pages=141–152|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.1.141}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially likely to occur in regard to negative characteristics.  Under certain conditions, ingroup members can be perceived as being similar to one another in regard to positive characteristics.  This effect is called ingroup homogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Lynne M.|title=The Psychology of Prejudice: From Attitudes to Social Action|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8MkAQAAMAAJ|year=2011|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-43380920-6|id={{ISBN|978-1-433-80920-0}}|pages=110–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[evolutionary psychology]], ingroup favoritism is seen as an evolved mechanism selected for the advantages of [[coalition]] affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=L. Cosmides |author2=J.

[[File:International Futures Logo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|right|International Futures (IFs) Logo]]

'''International Futures (IFs)''' is a global [[integrated assessment modelling|integrated assessment model]] designed to help in thinking strategically and systematically about key global systems (economic, demographic, education, health, environment, technology, domestic governance, infrastructure, agriculture, energy and environment) housed at the Frederick S. Pardee Center for International Futures. Initially created by [[Barry B. Hughes]] of the [[Josef Korbel School of International Studies]] at the [[University of Denver]] in [[Colorado]],&lt;ref&gt;Documentation can be found at http://www.ifs.du.edu regarding the history of IFs, specifically http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/IfsWebSite/IFs%20History.htm gives an overview of the different generations of IFs development.  See this for a TEDx talk about the model:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at47WLuA8Ks&lt;/ref&gt; the model is free for public use in both its online and downloadable forms.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Hughes,and  Evan Hillebrand  Paradigm Publishing, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Pardee Center for International Futures has partnered with many organizations to produce forecasts and data analysis.  IFs has been utilized in the [[National Intelligence Council|National Intelligence Council's]] ''Global Trends 2020'', ''Global Trends 2025'', and ''Global Trends 2030'' report.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.foia.cia.gov/2020/2020.pdf ''Mapping the Future: Report of the National Intelligence Council's 2020 Report'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916051336/http://www.foia.cia.gov/2020/2020.pdf |date=2012-09-16 }} and [http://www.aicpa.org/research/cpahorizons2025/globalforces/downloadabledocuments/globaltrends.pdf ''Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813062044/http://www.aicpa.org/research/cpahorizons2025/globalforces/downloadabledocuments/globaltrends.pdf |date=2012-08-13 }} and [http://www.dni.gov/index.php/carousel-items/778-global-trends-2030-alternative-worlds-available-for-download ''Global Trends 2030:  Alternative Worlds''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215110105/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/carousel-items/778-global-trends-2030-alternative-worlds-available-for-download |date=2012-12-15 }} [[Director of National Intelligence]]&lt;/ref&gt; The International Futures model has also contributed to the United Nations ''[[Human Development Report]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2011/papers/HDRP_2011_08.pdf ''Forecasting the Impacts of Environmental Constraints on Human Development'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Global Environment Outlook|Global Environmental Outlook]]''.

IFs is hosted free for public use by [[Google Public Data Explorer]], the [[Atlantic Council]], and the [[Institute for Security Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For hosts of the web-based version of the model, see International Futures on [http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=n4ff2muj8bh2a_ Google Public Data Explorer], The Atlantic Council and the [http://www.acus.org/program/strategic-foresight-initiative Strategic Foresight Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115045307/http://www.acus.org/program/strategic-foresight-initiative |date=2012-11-15 }}, and the Institute for Security Studies, as a part of the [http://www.issafrica.org/futures African Futures Project].  Additionally, the web version of the model is found on the [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/Ifs.aspx International Futures] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model structure ==
The model incorporates  dynamically linked  sub-models.  They include:  population, economic, agricultural, educational, energy, socio-political, international political, environmental, health, infrastructure and  technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifs.du.edu/introduction/elements.aspx Elements of International Futures], a structural explanation of the IFs model with block diagram.&lt;/ref&gt;  IFs is a unique modeling tool because it endogenizes the impact of such a wide range of global systems for 183 countries.

The help system that accompanies the software&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; provides an extensive overview of the model structure and computer code used to write the model.  IFs has three main functions, all connected to its conceptual treatment of integrated assessment forecasts: data analysis, scenario analysis, and display.&lt;ref&gt;An extended introductory video is found here:  http://vimeo.com/11090851&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data analysis ==
[[File:Crosssect.jpg|thumb|right|Example of cross-sectional analysis of [[total fertility rate]] and [[GDP]] per capita at [[purchasing power parity]]]]
The data analysis section of IFs represents a collection of over 2,000 data series from all major international data gatherers.  It is constantly updated with new data series.  This data forms the foundation of the model structure.  Users can analyze historic data cross-sectionally, longitudinally or on a [[world map]].  Using [[cross-sectional analysis]], users can  select a [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and plot this against up to 5 [[independent variables]].  It is then possible to animate the map to see how the cross-sectional relationship changes across the 40+ years of data in the [[database]].  Longitudinally, users can plot the relationship between a [[dependent variable]] and time, from 1960 (for most data series) through the most recent data year available.  A world map allows users to display data from any of these series using [[GIS]] options.

== Scenario analysis ==
[[File:IFsWorldPopulationHistoryForecastII.jpg|thumb|right| Forecast of world population for four [[UNEP]] scenarios from 1960&amp;ndash;2100]]

The software allows users to access and change the [[parameters]] and [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] that are used in the model. The [[scenario analysis|Scenario Analysis]] display lets users create their own global scenario or load a pre-run global scenario in their field of interest.  For example, to analyze the effects of a policy intervention on different sub-models and variables within the model, make the changes to the appropriate variable and then analyze the results in comparison to the base-case.  Many pre-run scenarios come packaged with the model, including work that has been completed for the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.unep.org/geo/GEO4/report/GEO-4_Report_Full_en.pdf ''Global Environmental Outlook 4''] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707225845/http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4/report/GEO-4_Report_Full_en.pdf |date=2009-07-07 }} that IFs made a contribution to&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Intelligence Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foia.cia.gov/2020/2020.pdf ''Mapping the Future: Report of the National Intelligence Council's 2020 Report'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916051336/http://www.foia.cia.gov/2020/2020.pdf |date=2012-09-16 }} and [http://www.aicpa.org/research/cpahorizons2025/globalforces/downloadabledocuments/globaltrends.pdf ''Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813062044/http://www.aicpa.org/research/cpahorizons2025/globalforces/downloadabledocuments/globaltrends.pdf |date=2012-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Display ==
[[File:Mortalitydisplay.jpg|thumb|right|Example of mortality display for Belgium in 2025]]
This portion of the software allows users to display the forecast results of their scenario analyses for different provinces, countries and groups across different issue areas.  Some of the specialized displays include: population, educational attainment, mortality rate, [[World Values Survey]], [[Gini coefficient]], the [[Millennium Development Goals]], [[social accounting matrix]], advanced sustainability analysis, and [[World Bank]] financial flows.

== Pardee Center for International Futures ==

The  project received a gift from [[Frederick S. Pardee]], formerly of [[RAND]], to construct the '''Pardee Center for International Futures''' at the [[University of Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;at {{cite web |url=http://www.ifs.du.edu/pardee/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902033255/http://www.ifs.du.edu/pardee/index.aspx |archivedate=2012-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is responsible for the further institutionalization of the software, training sessions, and the continued work on the ''Patterns of Potential Human Progress'' (PPHP) volumes.  The first PPHP volume discusses reduction in global poverty; the second, global education; the third, health care systems; the fourth, global infrastructure; the fifth, domestic governance.&lt;ref&gt;These can be downloaded either in final or draft form on their website "http://www.ifs.du.edu/documents/index.aspx"&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal [[Poverty and Public Policy]] reviewed the first PPHP volume, and concluded the following:

:For all their fine effort in data assembly and analysis, Hughes et al. intended that their first volume’s main contribution should be one not of prediction, but of promoting thought about poverty policy. Their attractively presented and lucid volume succeeds in this endeavor; it very usefully fulfills its promise to the student and policymaker.&lt;ref&gt;Soltys, Dennis (2010) “Review of Reducing Global Poverty: Patterns of Potential Human Progress, Vol. 1," Poverty &amp; Public Policy: Vol. 2: Iss. 2, Article 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== African Futures Project ==

The African Futures Project is a collaboration between the [[Institute for Security Studies]] and the Pardee Center for International Futures to promote long term strategic planning for African development.  This collaboration has led to the publication of various African Futures Project Policy Briefs,&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.issafrica.org/futures/publications.php Publications Section] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006215455/http://www.issafrica.org/futures/publications.php |date=2013-10-06 }} of the African Futures website for introductory videos and to read the policy briefs in full.&lt;/ref&gt; monographs on long-term African Development and a website where the IFs model can be used specifically for exploring African development.&lt;ref&gt;See the African Futures Project at: {{cite web |url=http://www.iss.co.za/futures/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403153619/http://www.iss.co.za/futures/ |archivedate=2013-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iron''', when used [[metaphor]]ically, refers to certain traits of the [[metal]] [[iron]]. Used as an [[adjective]] and sometimes as a [[noun]], it refers to something stern, harsh, unyielding, inflexible, rigid, sturdy, strong, robust, hard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/506459.stm "Iron: The man in the mask"], ''[[BBC News]]'' article from 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=iron Iron], definition at ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary]] of Idioms''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''{{Nonspecific|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2165">The '''Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/jburgdec.htm Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development], A/CONF.199/20, Chapter 1, Resolution 1, Johannesburg, September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD), sometimes referred to as '''Earth Summit 2002''', at which the '''Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/jburgpln.htm Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development], A/CONF.199/20, Chapter 1, Resolution 2, Johannesburg, September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; was also agreed upon.

The Johannesburg Declaration builds on earlier declarations made at the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/unchedec.htm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment], A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1, Chapter I, Stockholm, June 1972&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Stockholm]] in 1972, and the [[Earth Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/rio-dec.htm Rio Declaration on Environment and Development], A/CONF.151/26 (Vol. I), Chapter I, Annex I, Rio de Janeiro, June 1992&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992. While committing the nations of the world to [[sustainable development]], it also includes substantial mention of multilateralism as the path forward.

In terms of the political commitment of parties, the Declaration is a more general statement than the Rio Declaration.  It is an agreement to focus particularly on "the worldwide conditions that pose severe threats to the sustainable development of our people, which include: chronic hunger; malnutrition; foreign occupation; armed conflict; illicit drug problems; organized crime; corruption; natural disasters; illicit arms trafficking; trafficking in persons; terrorism; intolerance and incitement to racial, ethnic, religious and other hatreds; xenophobia; and endemic, communicable and chronic diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis." Johannesburg Declaration 19.

{{New Thought beliefs}}

In the [[New Thought]] philosophy, the '''Law of Attraction''' is the belief that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, people can bring positive or negative experiences into their life.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;Whittaker, S. [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 Secret attraction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090328/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''The Montreal Gazette'', May 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redden, Guy, "Magic Happens: A New Age Metaphysical Mystery Tour", ''Journal of Australian Studies'': 101&lt;/ref&gt; The belief is based on the idea that people and their thoughts are both made from pure energy, and that through the process of like energy attracting like energy a person can improve their own health, wealth, and personal relationships.

The [https://realpsychicnow.biz/ways-to-attract-abundance-and-prosperity-in-your-life/ Law of Attraction] is among the most popular of the Universal Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellison|first1=A|title=Metaphysics and Universal Laws|url=http://mysticculture.com/metaphysics-and-universal-laws/|website=Mystic Culture|publisher=Mystic Culture|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of this mind-power paradigm generally combine [[Cognitive reframing|cognitive reframing techniques]] with affirmations and [[creative visualization]] to replace limiting or self-destructive ("negative") thoughts with more empowered, adaptive ("positive") thoughts. A key component of the philosophy is that in order to effectively change one's negative thinking patterns, one must also "feel" (through creative visualization) that the desired changes have already occurred. This combination of positive thought and positive emotion is believed to allow one to attract positive experiences and opportunities by achieving resonance with the proposed energetic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/what-is-the-law-of-attraction/|title=What Is The Law Of Attraction|last1=Hurst|first1=Katherine|date=|website=The Law Of Attraction|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[New Thought]] movement (Law of Attraction Origins) grew out of the teachings of [[Phineas Quimby]] in the early 19th century. Early in his life, Quimby was diagnosed with tuberculosis. However, medicinal treatment wasn't working, so he began carriage riding through his hometown, Lebanon, New Hampshire. He then regained his health and recovered, an event that prompted his study of "mind over body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=n|title=Phineas Parkhurst Quimby|url=http://phineasquimby.wwwhubs.com/|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he never used the words 'Law of Attraction', he explained this in a statement that captured the concept in the field of health: {{quote|the trouble is in the mind, for the body is only the house for the mind to dwell in, and we put a value on it according to its worth. Therefore if your mind has been deceived by some invisible enemy into a belief, you have put it into the form of a disease, with or without your knowledge. By my theory or truth, I come in contact with your enemy and restore you to your health and happiness. This I do partly mentally and partly by talking till I correct the wrong impressions and establish the Truth, and the Truth is the cure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Quimby Manuscripts|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/quimbyPhineas/manuscripts/pages/quimby-manuscripts-194.htm|publisher=New Thought library|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In 1877, the term 'Law of Attraction' appeared in print for the first time in a book written by the Russian occultist [[Helena Blavatsky]], in a context alluding to an attractive power existing between elements of spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isis Unveiled|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/isis/iu1-10.htm|publisher=Theosophical University Press, page 340|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Her book ''Isis Unveiled'' discusses esoteric mysteries of ancient theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blavatsky|first1=Helena|title=Isis Unveiled|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/isis/iu-hp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

But the one who really first articulated the Law as general principle was [[Prentice Mulford]]. Mulford, a pivotal figure in the development of New Thought thinking, discusses the Law of Attraction at length in, for example, his essay "The Law of Success",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Forces and How to Use  Them, Vol. 1|url=https://archive.org/stream/yourforcesandho09mulfgoog#page/n66/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; published 1886-1887. In this, Mulford was followed by other New Thought authors, such as Henry Wood (starting with his ''God’s Image in Man'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=God's Image in Man, Ch. 6, "The Universality of Law"|url=https://archive.org/stream/godsimageinmans01woodgoog#page/n134/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1892), and [[Ralph Waldo Trine]] (starting with his first book, ''What All the World's A-Seeking'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What All the World's A-Seeking|url=https://archive.org/details/whatallworldsas00tringoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1896). For these authors, the Law of Attraction is concerned not only about health but every aspect of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Tune With The Infinite|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/trineRalphWaldo/inTune/pages/in-tune-with-the-infinite-026.htm#TopOfText|publisher=New Thought Library|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE GOD IN YOU|url=http://prenticemulford.wwwhubs.com/tgiy.htm|publisher=Cornerstone Publishing, 2001|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century saw a surge in interest in the subject with many books being written about it, amongst which are two of the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling books]] of all time; [[Think and Grow Rich]] (1937) by [[Napoleon Hill]] and [[You Can Heal Your Life]] (1984) by [[Louise Hay]].

Even if the [[New Age|New Age movement]] adopted many New Thought ideas, including that of the Law of Attraction, the Law of Attraction remains a new thought philosophical concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Company Aims to Put Good Karma and Energy Close at Hand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/us/seeking-good-karma-a-company-aims-to-put-it-close-at-hand.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times, 28 March 2014|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the concept of the Law of Attraction gained a lot of renewed exposure with the release of the film ''[[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]]'' (2006) which was then developed into a book of the same title in 2007. The movie and book gained widespread media coverage.&lt;ref name=gazette /&gt;&lt;ref name=oprah1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oprah.com/spirit/The-Law-of-Attraction-Real-Life-Stories_1 |title=The Law of Attraction: Real-Life Stories - Oprah.com |work=oprah.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oprah2&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Go-Beyond-The-Secret_1 |title=Go Beyond 'The Secret' - Oprah.com |work=oprah.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhonda Byrne]]'s book also has influenced the creation of an untitled fiction film based on The Secret, starring Katie Holmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/the-secret-movie/|title=The Secret Movie (2018) Based on The Secret by Rhonda Byrne|date=2017-09-08|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a sequel, [[The Power (self-help book)|The Power]] in 2010 that talks about the law of attraction being the law of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/power-author-rhonda-byrnes-book/story?id=11421349|title=The Secret Is Out: Megahit Writer Says Power of Love Will Fill Your Bank Account|last=NANCE-NASH|first=SHERYL|date=August 18, 2010|work=ABC News|access-date=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions==
New Thought authors believe that the Law of Attraction is always in operation and that it brings to each person the conditions and experiences that they predominantly think about, or which they desire or expect.

[[Charles F. Haanel|Charles Haanel]] wrote in ''[[The Master Key System]]'' (1912):
{{quote|The law of attraction will certainly and unerringly bring to you the conditions, environment, and experiences in life, corresponding with your habitual, characteristic, predominant mental attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Master Key System. Chapter 8, part 18.|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/haanel-charles/Master-Key-System/audioEbook/master-key-systemRAW.pdf|publisher=New Thought Library|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Ralph Trine wrote in ''In Tune With The Infinite'' (1897):
{{quote|The law of attraction works universally on every plane of action, and we attract whatever we desire or expect. If we desire one thing and expect another, we become like houses divided against themselves, which are quickly brought to desolation. Determine resolutely to expect only what you desire, then you will attract only what you wish for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Tune With The Infinite, by Ralph Trine|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/trineRalphWaldo/inTune/pages/in-tune-with-the-infinite-035.htm#TopOfText|publisher=New Thought Library|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Rhonda Byrne published in 2006 the film [[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]] wherein she emphasized thinking about what each person wants to obtain, but also to infuse the thought with the maximum possible amount of emotion. She claims the combination of thought and feeling is what attracts the desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tameyourmind.org/articles/how-can-it-possibly-be-law-attraction-works|title=How can it possibly be that the law of attraction works?|last=Henry|first=Juliette|date=|website=www.tameyourmind.org|publisher=Transformation guide|access-date=3 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secret says your subconscious mind can control everything that happens around you, including both positive experiences, like having someone call you from miles away, and negative experiences, like death. The Byrne underlines the power of the subconscious mind by asking the reader to take full control of these thoughts, in order to achieve things in life, with the mind, as much as with action. Another similar book is [[James Redfield]]'s ''[[The Celestine Prophecy]]'', which says reality can be manifested by man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redfield|first1=James|title=The Celestine Prophecy: An Adventure|date=1993|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man and the universe have a force of attraction between them similar to a magnetic attraction. ''The Power of Your Subconscious Mind'' by Joseph Murphy, says readers can achieve seemingly impossible goals by learning how to bring the mind itself under control. ''The Power'' by Rhonda Byrne, ''The Alchemist'' by Paulo Coelho, and ''The Power of Now'' by Eckhart Tolle are similar. While personal testimonies claim the secret and the law to have worked for them, a number of skeptics have criticized Rhonda Byrne's film and book. ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' called the secret pseudoscience and an "illusion of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chabris|first1=Christopher F.|last2=Simons|first2=Daniel J.|title=The Pseudoscience of ‘The Secret’ and ‘The Power’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/books/review/Chabris-t.html|accessdate=2017-08-13|work=The New York Times|date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and religious basis==
The New Thought concept of the Law of Attraction is rooted in ideas that come from various philosophical and religious traditions.  In particular, it has been inspired by [[Hermeticism]], [[New England transcendentalism]], specific verses from the [[Bible]], and [[Hinduism]],

Hermeticism influenced the development of European thought in the [[Renaissance]]. Its ideas were transmitted partly through [[alchemy]]. In the 18th century, [[Franz Mesmer]] studied the works of alchemists such as [[Paracelsus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Aoust|first1=Maja|title=The Secret Source|date=2012|publisher=Process|isbn=978-1-934170-32-8|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jan Baptist van Helmont|van Helmont]].&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt; Van Helmont was a 17th-century [[Flemish people|Flemish]] physician who proclaimed the curative powers of the imagination.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedesan|first1=Georgiana D.|title=Paracelsian Medicine and Theory of Generation in ‘Exterior homo’, a Manuscript Probably Authored by Jan Baptist Van Helmont (1579–1644), ref 52|journal=Medical History|date=July 2014|volume=58|issue=03|pmc=4103403|pmid=25045180|doi=10.1017/mdh.2014.29|pages=375–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedesan|first1=Delia Georgiana|title=‘Christian Philosophy’: Medical Alchemy and Christian Thought in the Work of Jan Baptista Van Helmont (1579-1644)|date=2012|page= 31|url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/4083/HedesanD.pdf?sequence=4|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lead Mesmer to develop his ideas about [[Animal magnetism]] which [[Phineas Quimby]], the founder of New Thought, studied.&lt;ref name=Hist&gt;{{cite web|last1=Braden|first1=Charles S.|title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE NEW THOUGHT MOVEMENT.(1963)|url=http://www.surrenderworks.com/library/downloads/braden.pdf|publisher=surrenderworks.com|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHINEAS PARKHURST QUIMBY 1802 - 1866 Father of New Thought|url=http://phineasquimby.wwwhubs.com/|publisher=phineasquimby|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transcendentalist movement developed in the United States immediately before the emergence of New Thought and is thought to have had a great influence on it. [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]], an important figure in that movement, stated that its leading idea was "the supremacy of mind over matter".&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mikics|first1=David|title=The Annotated Emerson|date=2012|publisher=Belknap Press|isbn=978-0674049239|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nI3uBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22george+ripley%22+%22the+supremacy+of+mind+over+matter%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F4dN_3p4mO&amp;sig=kr_BiWEHcVDvCHTbSaxHUW6apJI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMInfvbtLacyQIVim8UCh0YTg1T#v=onepage&amp;q=%22george%20ripley%22%20%22the%20supremacy%20of%20mind%20over%20matter%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Thought authors often quote certain verses from the Bible in the context of the Law of Attraction. An example is [[Mark 11]]:24: "Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark 11:24|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+11%3A24&amp;version=RSV|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Master Key System, by Charles Haanel (1912).

In the late 19th century [[Swami Vivekananda]] traveled to the United States and gave lectures on [[Hinduism]]. These talks greatly influenced the New Thought movement and in particular, [[William Walker Atkinson]] who was one of New Thought's pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Aoust|first1=Maja|title=The Secret Source|date=2012|publisher=Process|isbn=978-1-934170-32-8|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodroffe|first1=John|title=Shakti and Shâkta, Chapter 24, 12th paragraph|date=1918|publisher=Luzac &amp; Co|isbn=978-1595479204|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/tantra/sas/sas24.htm|

==Criticism==
''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine criticized the lack of [[falsifiability]] and [[testability]] of these claims.&lt;ref name="csicop.org"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mary Carmichael |author2=Ben Radford |url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/secrets_and_lies/ |title=CSI &amp;#124; Secrets and Lies |publisher=Csicop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have asserted that the evidence provided is usually [[anecdotal]] and that, because of the [[publication bias|self-selecting nature of the positive reports]], as well as the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] nature of any results, these reports are susceptible to [[confirmation bias]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref name="Kaptchuck"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaptchuk, T., &amp; Eisenberg, D. |year=1998 |title=The Persuasive Appeal of Alternative Medicine |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=129 |issue=12 |pmid=9867762 |pages=1061–5 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-129-12-199812150-00011|last2=Eisenberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Ali Alousi]], for instance, criticized it as unmeasurable and questioned the likelihood that thoughts can affect anything outside the head.&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt;

The Law of Attraction has been popularized in the early 21st century by books and films such as ''[[The Secret (book)|The Secret]]''. This 2006 film and the subsequent book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret |year=2006 |first=Rhonda |last=Byrne |publisher=Beyond Words Publishing |isbn=978-1-58270-170-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; use interviews with New Thought authors and speakers to explain the principles of the proposed metaphysical law that one can attract anything that one thinks about consistently. Writing for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, [[Mary Carmichael]] and [[Ben Radford]] wrote that "neither the film nor the book has any basis in scientific reality", and that its premise contains "an ugly flipside: if you have an accident or disease, it's your fault".&lt;ref name="csicop.org"/&gt;

Others have questioned the references to modern scientific theory, and have maintained, for example, that the Law of Attraction misrepresents the electrical activity of [[Neural oscillation|brainwaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Scientific American |date=June 2007 |volume=296 |issue=6 |pages=39–39 |title=The (Other) Secret |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-other-secret |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0607-39|last1=Shermer |first1=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Stenger]] and [[Leon Lederman]] are critical of attempts to use [[quantum mysticism]] to bridge any unexplained or seemingly implausible effects, believing these to be traits of modern [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |title=Cosmic Mind |url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/01CosmicMind.pdf |publisher=University of Colorado |authorlink=Victor_Stenger |pages=8–19 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924013317/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/01CosmicMind.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leon Lederman 1993 189–198"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

==Prominent supporters==

* In 1891 Californian author and humorist [[Prentice Mulford]] used the term Law of Attraction in his essays ''Some Laws of Health and Beauty'' and ''Good And Ill Effects of Thought''.
* In 1897 [[Ralph Waldo Trine]] wrote ''In Tune with the Infinite''. In the second paragraph of chapter 9 he writes, "The Law of Attraction works unceasingly throughout the universe, and the one great and never changing fact in connection with it is, as we have found, that like attracts like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trine|first1=Ralph|title=In Tune With The Infinite|publisher=G Bell and Sons, LTD.  Published 1911|location=London|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Troward]], a strong influence in the New Thought Movement, gave a 1904 lecture in which he claimed that thought precedes physical form and "the action of Mind plants that nucleus which, if allowed to grow undisturbed, will eventually attract to itself all the conditions necessary for its manifestation in outward visible form."&lt;ref&gt;Judge Thomas Troward, ''The Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science'', 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1902 English New Thought writer [[James Allen (author)|James Allen]] (best known for writing ''[[As a Man Thinketh]]'') wrote a series of books and articles between 1901 and 1912, after which his wife [[Lily L. Allen|Lily]] continued his work.
* [[Emmet Fox]] wrote about metaphysics and the power of prayer in essays and books. His teachings are founded in Christianity and bible stories. He cites Jesus Christ as being the greatest teacher of metaphysics who ever lived and explains that thoughts are our most important emanation, more important than what we say or what we do. In the books ''Power Through Constructive Thinking'' and ''Find and Use your Inner Power'' Fox speaks about "building the mental equivalent of what you want and to expunge those that you don't".
* In his New Thought Movement book [[William Walker Atkinson]] used the phrase ''Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World'' (1906), stating that "like attracts like".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gitacademy.tripod.com/GodsInTraining/ThoughtVibration.htm William Walker Atkinson. ''Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction''. Advanced Thought Publishing. 1906.] Out of Copyright version&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bruce MacLelland]]'s ''Prosperity Through Thought Force'' (1907), a [[prosperity theology]] book, summarizes the principle as "You are what you think, not what you think you are." It was published by [[Elizabeth Towne]], the editor of ''[[The Nautilus (magazine)|The Nautilus Magazine, a Journal of New Thought]]''.&lt;ref name="maclelland"&gt;MacLelland, Bruce, ''Prosperity Through Thought Force,'' Elizabeth Towne, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his 1910 ''The Science of Getting Rich'' [[Wallace D. Wattles]] espoused similar principles — that simply believing in the object of your desire and focusing on it will lead to that object or goal being realized on the material plane (Wattles claims in the Preface and later chapters of this book that his premise stems from the [[monistic]] [[Hindu]] view that God provides everything and can deliver what we focus on). The book also claims negative thinking will manifest negative results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Getting_Rich |title=The Science of Getting Rich - Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] author [[William Quan Judge]] used the phrase in ''The Ocean of Theosophy'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Judge | first = William Quan |title = The Ocean of Theosophy |publisher =United Lodge of Theosophists |year= 1915 | page = 103|isbn= 0-7661-0544-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another theosophical author [[Annie Besant]] discussed the 'Law of Attraction' in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POPULAR LECTURES ON THEOSOPHY|url=http://www.anandgholap.net/Popular_Lectures_On_Theosophy-AB.htm|publisher=anandgholap|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besant compared her version of it to [[gravitation]], and said that the law represented a form of [[karma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karma|url=http://www.anandgholap.net/Karma-AB.htm|publisher= Theosophical Publishing House|accessdate=16 May 2012|author=Annie Besant|year=1895|edition= First}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Napoleon Hill]] published two books on the theme. The first, ''[[The Law of Success|The Law of Success in 16 Lessons]]'' (1928), directly and repeatedly references the Law of Attraction and proposes that it operates by use of radio waves transmitted by the brain. The second, ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937), went on to sell 100 million copies by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Think and Grow Rich |url=http://www.naphill.org/shop/books/think-and-grow-rich/ |date=2015 |publisher=Napoleon Hill Foundation |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill insisted on the importance of controlling one's own thoughts in order to achieve success, as well as the energy that thoughts have and their ability to attract other thoughts. He mentions a "secret" to success and promises to indirectly describe it at least once in every chapter. It is never named and he says that discovering it on one's own is far more beneficial. Many people have argued over what it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why The Law of Attraction has been a Secret|url=http://www.law-of-attraction.com/131/law-of-attraction-has-been-a-secret/|publisher=Positive Inspiration|access-date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; actually is, some claim it's the Law of Attraction. Hill states the "secret" is mentioned no fewer than a hundred times, yet reference to "attract" is used less than 30 times in the text. He further claims that people can obtain what they desire through thought of definite purpose.{{sfn|Hill|2010|pp=23-24}}
* [[Israel Regardie]] published books with the Law of Attraction theme as one of his prevailing Universal Laws. In, ''The Art of True Healing: A Treatise on the Mechanism of Prayer and the Operation of the Law of Attraction in Nature'' (1937), he taught a focused meditation technique to help the mind to learn to heal itself on a physical and spiritual level. Regardie claimed that the Law of Attraction was a valid method for attracting good physical health and for improvement in any aspect of one's life.&lt;ref name="Regardie 1974 p.

A '''lingam''' ([[Sanskrit]]: लिङ्गम्, {{IAST3|liGga}}, lit. "sign, symbol or mark"), sometimes referred to as ''linga'' or ''Shiva linga'', is an abstract or [[Aniconism|aniconic]] representation of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity [[Shiva]] in [[Shaivism]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; It is a votary symbol  revered in [[Hindu temple|temples]], smaller shrines, or as [[Swayambhu|self-manifested]] natural objects.&lt;ref name=doh&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=W.J.|title=A dictionary of Hinduism|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780191726705|edition=1st|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198610250.001.0001/acref-9780198610250-e-1458|accessdate=5 January 2016|subscription=yes}}{{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=Jeaneane|title=Hinduism : beliefs and practices|date=1997|publisher=Sussex Acad.

Lingam is additionally found in ancient Sanskrit texts with the meaning of "evidence, proof",&lt;ref name=mmw901/&gt; or in sexual context where it means the "male generative organ, [[phallus]]".&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmw901/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonnefoy1993p38"/&gt; Lingam iconography found at archaeological sites of the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia include simple cylinders set inside a ''yoni'', rounded pillars with carvings such as of one or more ''mukha'' (faces), and anatomically realistic representations of an erect phallus such as at [[Gudimallam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

Lingam, states Monier Monier-Williams, appears in the Upanishads and epic literature, and it means a "mark, sign, emblem, characteristic".&lt;ref name=mmw901&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0901-lAvaNaka.jpg Linga], Monier Monier-Williams, Harvard University Archives, pp. 901-[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0902-liGgakAraNavAda.jpg 902]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lochtefeld390/&gt; Other contextual meanings of the term include "evidence, proof, symptom",&lt;ref name=mmw901/&gt; and "gender, male organ, phallus".&lt;ref name=mmw901/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonnefoy1993p38"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yves Bonnefoy|title=Asian Mythologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4I-FsZCzJEC |year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-06456-7|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also appears in early Indian texts on logic, where an inference is based on a sign (linga), such as "if there is smoke, there is fire" where the linga is the smoke.&lt;ref name=mmw901/&gt; According to James Lochtefeld, it is sometimes "simplistically called a phallic symbol".&lt;ref name=lochtefeld390/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliade332/&gt;&lt;ref name=dasgupta107/&gt; It is a religious symbol in Hinduism representing Shiva as the generative power,&lt;ref name=lochtefeld390&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

The lingam of the [[Shaivism]] tradition is a short cylindrical pillar-like symbol of Shiva, made of stone, metal, gem, wood, clay or disposable material.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/342336/lingam |title= lingam|year =2010|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rao1993p76"/&gt; According to ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', the lingam is a votary aniconic object found in the sanctum of Shiva temples and private shrines that symbolizes [[Shiva]] and is "revered as an emblem of generative power".&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; It often is found within a lipped, disked structure that is an emblem of goddess [[Shakti]] and this is called the ''yoni''. Together they symbolize the union of the feminine and the masculine principles, and "the totality of all existence", states ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; 

According to Rohit Dasgupta, the lingam symbolizes Shiva in Hinduism, and it is also a phallic symbol.&lt;ref name=dasgupta107/&gt; Since the 19th-century, states Dasgupta, the popular literature has represented the lingam as the male sex organ. This view contrasts with the traditional abstract values they represent in Shaivism wherein the lingam-yoni connote the masculine and feminine principles in the entirety of creation and all existence.&lt;ref name=dasgupta107/&gt; According to Wendy Doniger, for many Hindus, the lingam is not a "male sexual organ" but of a spiritual icon and their faith, just like for the Christians the cross is not an "instrument of execution" but a symbol of Christ and the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=503|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, "the cross is thus a sign both of Christ himself and of the faith of Christians.

According to Alex Wayman, given the Shaiva philosophical texts and spiritual interpretations, various works on Shaivism by some Indian authors "deny that the linga is a phallus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alex Wayman| title=O, that Linga!|year = 1987|volume=68|issue=1/4| journal=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute| page=30}}, Quote: "That is why today one will read in various works by Indian on Saivism a denial that the linga is a phallus; and the late Dr. Basham once told the present writer that in all the years of his India contacts he never found any Saivite admitting that the linga is a phallus."&lt;/ref&gt; To the Shaivites, a linga is neither a phallus nor do they practice the worship of erotic penis-vulva, rather the linga-yoni is a symbol of cosmic mysteries, the creative powers and the metaphor for the spiritual truths of their faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alex Wayman| title=O, that Linga!|year = 1987|volume=68|issue=1/4| journal=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute| pages=29-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeology and Indus valley===
According to Chakrabarti, "some of the stones found in Mohenjodaro are unmistakably phallic stones". These are dated to some time before 2300 BCE. Similarly, states Chakrabarti, the Kalibangan site of Harappa has a small terracotta representation that "would undoubtedly be considered the replica of a modern Shivlinga [a tubular stone]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDAlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39|title=Hindu Images and Their Worship with Special Reference to Vaisnavism: A Philosophical-theological Inquiry|last=Lipner|first=Julius J.|authorlink=Julius J.

Another postage stamp sized item found and called the ''Pashupati seal'', states Doniger, has an image with a general resemblance with Shiva and "the Indus people may well have created the symbolism of the divine phallus", but given the available evidence we cannot be certain, nor do we know that it had the same meaning as some currently project them to might have meant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=485-502|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Indologist [[Asko Parpola]], "it is true that Marshall's and Mackay's hypotheses of linga and yoni worship by the Harappans has rested on rather slender grounds, and that for instance the interpretation of the so-called ring-stones as yonis seems untenable".&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt; He quotes Dales 1984 paper, which states "with the single exception of the unidentified photography of a realistic phallic object in Marshall's report, there is no archaeological evidence to support claims of special sexually-oriented aspects of Harappan religion".&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt; However, adds Parpola, a re-examination at Indus Valley sites suggest that the Mackay's hypothesis cannot be ruled out because erotic and sexual scenes such as ithyphallic males, naked females, a human couple having intercourse and trefoil imprints have now been identified at the Harappan sites.&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt; The "finely polished circular stand" found by Mackay may be yoni although it was found without the linga. The absence of linga, states Parpola, maybe because it was made from wood which did not survive.&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt;

===Mahabharata===
According to Doniger, the ''Mahabharata'' is the first ancient Hindu text where the ''lingam'' is "unequivocally designating the sexual organ of Shiva".&lt;ref name=doniger491/&gt; Chapter 10.17 of the ''Mahabharata'' also refers to the word ''sthanu'' in the sense of an "inanimate pillar" as well as a "name of Shiva, signifying the immobile, ascetic, desexualized form of the ''lingam''", as it recites the legend involving [[Shiva]], [[Brahma]] and [[Prajapati]].&lt;ref name=doniger491/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=Freud's Mahabharata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hhnDwAAQBAJ |year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-087834-4|pages=123-124, footnote 179}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mythology weaves two polarities, one where the lingam represents the potentially procreative phallus (fertile lingam) and its opposite "a pillar-like renouncer of sexuality" (ascetic lingam), states Doniger.&lt;ref name=doniger491/&gt;

===Puranas===

This phrase connotes "[we have found an] indicative sign", such as the "indicative sign is in a Vedic passage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alex Wayman| title=O, that Linga!|year = 1987|volume=68|issue=1/4| journal=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute| pages=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is persuasive evidence in later Sanskrit literature, according to Doniger, that the early Indians associated the lingam icon with the male sexual organ.&lt;ref name=doniger493&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=493-498|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 11th-century Kashmir text ''Narmamala'' by Kshemendra on satire and fiction writing explains his ideas on parallelism with divine lingam and human lingam in a sexual context. Various Shaiva texts, such as the ''Skanda Purana'' in section 1.8 states that all creatures have the signs of Shiva or Shakti through their ''lingam'' (male sexual organ) or ''pindi'' (female sexual organ).&lt;ref name=doniger493/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

A part of the literature corpus regards ''lingam'' to be sexual and the phallus of Shiva, while another group of texts does not. Sexuality in the former is inherently sacred and spiritual, while the latter emphasizes the ascetic nature of Shiva and renunciation to be spiritual symbolism of ''lingam''. This tension between the pursuit of spirituality through householder lifestyle and the pursuit of renunciate sannyasi lifestyle is historic, reflects the different interpretations of the lingam and what lingam worship means to its devotees. It remains a continuing debate within Hinduism to this day, states Doniger.&lt;ref name=doniger493/&gt; To one group, it is a part of Shiva's body and symbolically ''saguna'' Shiva (he in a physical form with attributes). To the other group, it is an abstract symbol of ''nirguna'' Shiva (he in the universal Absolute Reality, formless, without attributes).&lt;ref name=doniger493/&gt; In Tamil Shaiva tradition, for example, the common term for lingam is ''kuRi'' or "sign, mark" which is nonsexual.&lt;ref name=doniger493/&gt; Similarly, in [[Lingayatism]] tradition, the lingam is a spiritual symbol and "was never said to have any sexual connotations", according to Doniger.&lt;ref name=donigerp498/&gt; To some Shaivites, it symbolizes the axis of the universe.&lt;ref name="Bayly2003p55"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Bayly|title=Saints, Goddesses and Kings: Muslims and Christians in South Indian Society, 1700-1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fxqtx8SflEsC|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89103-5|pages=129–130 with footnote 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Linga also appears in Buddhist and Jaina literature, where it means "sign, evidence" in one context, or "subtle body" with sexual connotations in another.&lt;ref name=wayman1987&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alex Wayman| title=O, that Linga!|year = 1987|volume=68|issue=1/4| journal=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute| pages=17, 22-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Examples of this usage include the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra|Lankavatara sutra]]'' in Buddhism, and Sukhlalji's ''bhasya'' on ''[[Tattvarthasutra|Tattvartha sutra]]'' in Jainism.&lt;ref name=wayman1987/&gt;}}

===Muslim rule===
After the 11th-century invasion of the subcontinent by Islamic armies, the iconoclast Muslims considered the lingam to be idolatrous representations of the male sexual organ. They took pride in destroying as many lingams and Shiva temples as they could, reusing them to build steps for mosques, in a region stretching from Somanath (Gujarat) to Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh) to Chidambaram (Tamil Nadu), states Doniger.&lt;ref name=donigerp498&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=498-499|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mehrdad Shokoohy|title=Muslim Architecture of South India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=InklyjG57csC&amp;pg=PA17 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-49984-5|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalist literature===
The colonial era Orientalists and Christian missionaries, raised in the Victorian mold where sex and sexual imagery were a taboo subject, were shocked by and were hostile to the lingam-yoni iconography and reverence they witnessed.&lt;ref name=dasgupta107&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Penis|page=107| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bHytBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107 |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield|author= Rohit Dasgupta| editor=Michael Kimmel, Christine Milrod, Amanda Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas T.

The British in general, who were of course Victorian in every sense of the word, regarded the Hindus, as they regarded most colonized people of color, as simultaneously oversexed and impotent, and the British presence had a negative effect on the self-perception that Hindus had of their own bodies (Nandy 1983). For, still reeling from the onslaught of the Muslim campaigns against lingams, the Hindus who worked with and for the British internalized their colonizers' scorn."&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th and early 20th-century colonial and missionary literature described lingam-yoni, and related theology as obscene, corrupt, licentious, hyper-sexualized, puerile, impure, demonic and a culture that had become too feminine and dissolute.&lt;ref name=dasgupta107/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramos2017p56"&gt;{{cite book|author=Imma Ramos|title=Pilgrimage and Politics in Colonial Bengal: The Myth of the Goddess Sati|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRhdDgAAQBAJ |year=2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-84000-2|pages=56–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh B.

Vivekananda called for the revival of the Mother Goddess as a feminine force, inviting his countrymen to "proclaim her to all the world with the voice of peace and benediction".&lt;ref name="Ramos2017p56"/&gt;

According to Wendy Doniger, the terms lingam and yoni became explicitly associated with human sexual organs in the western imagination after the widely popular first ''Kamasutra'' translation by Sir Richard Burton in 1883.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500/&gt; In his translation, even though the original Sanskrit text does not use the words lingam or yoni for sexual organs, and almost always uses other terms, Burton adroitly avoided been viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by avoiding the use of words such as penis, vulva, vagina and other direct or indirect sexual terms in the Sanskrit text to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500/&gt; This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to "anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away."&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=500-502|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar Orientalist literature of the Christian missionaries and the British era, states Doniger, stripped all spiritual meanings and insisted on the Victorian vulgar interpretation only, which had "a negative effect on the self-perception that Hindus had of their own bodies" and they became "ashamed of the more sensual aspects of their own religious literature".&lt;ref name=doniger2011p505&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=499-505|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary Hindus, states Doniger, in their passion to spiritualize Hinduism and for their Hindutva campaign have sought to sanitize the historic earthly sexual meanings, and insist on the abstract spiritual meaning only.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p505/&gt;

==Iconography and worship==
The traditional lingam rituals in major Shiva temples includes offerings of flowers, grass, dried rice, fruits, leaves, water and a milk bath.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Priests chant hymns, while the devotees go the sanctum for a ''[[darshana]]'' followed by a clockwise circumambulation of the sanctum.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; On the sanctum walls, typically are reliefs of Dakshinamurti, Brahma and Vishnu. Often, near the sanctum are other shrines, particularly for Shakti (Durga), Ganesha and Murugan (Kartikeya). In the Hindu tradition, special pilgrimage sites include those where natural lingams are found in the form of cylindrical rocks or ice or rocky hill. These are called ''Svayambhuva'' lingam, and about 70 of these are known on the Indian subcontinent, the most significant being one in Kashi ([[Varanasi]]) followed by Prayaga, Naimisha and Gaya.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rao1993p81"&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

{{Judicial interpretation}}
In [[Canadian law]], the '''living tree doctrine''' ({{Lang-fr|théorie de l'arbre vivant}}) is a [[legal doctrine|doctrine]] of constitutional interpretation that says that a constitution is organic and must be read in a broad and progressive manner so as to adapt it to the changing times.

== Concept ==
The living tree doctrine has been deeply entrenched into Canadian constitutional law since the seminal constitutional case of ''[[Edwards v Canada (Attorney General)]]'' also widely known as the ''Persons Case'' wherein [[John Sankey, 1st Viscount Sankey|Viscount Sankey]] stated in the 1929 decision: "The [[British North America Act]] planted in Canada [is] a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits." This is known as the Doctrine of Progressive Interpretation. This means that the Constitution cannot be interpreted in the same way as an ordinary statute. Rather, it must be read within the context of society to ensure that it adapts and reflects changes. If constitutional interpretation adheres to the [[original intent|Framer's Intent]] and remains rooted in the past, the Constitution would not be reflective of society and eventually fall into disuse. 

{{quote|
The "frozen concepts" reasoning runs contrary to one of the most fundamental principles of Canadian constitutional interpretation: that our Constitution is a living tree which, by way of progressive interpretation, accommodates and addresses the realities of modern life....

Lord Sankey LC’s reference to "natural limits" did not impose an obligation to determine, in the abstract and absolutely, the core meaning of constitutional terms....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Reference re Same-Sex Marriage|link=Reference re Same-Sex Marriage|year=2004|court=scc|num=79|pinpoint=par. 22, 28|parallelcite=[2004] 3 SCR 698|date=2004-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

However, "natural limits" cannot be granted too elastic a definition. In the [[Bank of Montreal v. Marcotte|Marcotte trilogy]], it was held that payments by [[credit card]] could not be considered to fall within the federal [[bills of exchange]] power, as there had been no shift in how a bill of exchange is defined in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Marcotte v. Fédération des caisses Desjardins du Québec|year=2014|court=scc|num=57|pinpoint=par. 21|date = 2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charter ==
The interpretation of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] also makes use of the living tree doctrine.  Chief Justice [[Antonio Lamer]] stated in ''[[Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act]]'', "If the newly planted 'living tree' which is the Charter is to have the possibility of growth and adjustment over time, care must be taken to ensure that historical materials, such as the Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee, do not stunt its growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act|link=Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act|year=1985|court=scc|num=81|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 53|parallelcite=[1985] 2 SCR 486|date=1985-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation." ''Psychological review'' 98.2 (1991): 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gergen, Kenneth J.]] ''Realities and relationships: Soundings in social construction.'' Harvard University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Gergen grew up on the plains of southwestern [[Minnesota]], and later moved with her family to [[St. Louis Park]], a suburb of [[Minneapolis]]. She obtained her B.S. in English and Education with a minor in speech and theatre at the [[University of Minnesota]], where she was elected [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. She was a member of [[Delta Gamma]] sorority. Gergen later obtained her M.S. in [[Educational Psychology]] with a specialization in counseling at the University of Minnesota. Mary Gergen earned a Ph.D. at Temple University in Social Psychology.

Moving to [[Boston]] with her first husband, Michael Gebhart, and their two children, Lisa and Michael, she worked at [[Harvard University]] as a research assistant in the Social Relations Department, and later at the [[Harvard Business School]] in marketing. In 1969 she married [[Kenneth J. Gergen]] and moved to Rose Valley, [[Pennsylvania]].

Since the 1970s, she has been a member of the [[American Psychological Association]], and a founding member and fellow of Div. 35, The Society for the Psychology of Women.

In 1980, Mary Gergen earned a Ph.D. in Psychology at [[Temple University]], with a specialization in [[Social Psychology]]. She also worked for four years as a psychological consultant for [[AT&amp;T]] on their longitudinal study of managers' lives.

Gergen began her teaching career at [[Penn State]], Brandywine in 1984 as an assistant professor in Psychology and [[Women's studies]]. In 1988-89, Gergen was a fellow at the [[Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study]]. She won the [[George W. Atherton]] teaching award, a university wide honor, in 1966, and became a full professor. Gergen was given the title of [[Emeritus|Emerita]] upon retiring from the college in 2006.

In the early 1990s, she was one of the seven founders of The [[Taos Institute]], a non-profit organization dedicated to the development of [[social constructionist]] ideas within diverse practice areas, including therapy, organizational consulting, and education. She is a co-creator of the positive aging newsletter healthandage.com, an electronically distributed news source designed to reconstruct the negative stereotype of aging, and to provide an alternative that is more promising in potential. She also edits the ''Tempo Book'' series. Mary Gergen travels internationally to give lectures and workshops and serves on examination committees and as an external examiner for Ph.D. theses from many countries, in addition to supervising several doctoral dissertations and teaching in a theoretical psychology program at [[Massey University]], NZ.

== Work == 
Gergen’s  major contributions lie at the intersection of [[feminist theory]], and social constructionist ideas. Her attempt, at the outset, was to develop an alternative in studies of gender to both the hegemonic empiricist mode and the feminist standpoint orientation. This alternative grew from her engagement with social constructionist theory.

=== Towards a feminist methodology ===
Her first major effort to address this shift “Towards a feminist methodology” appeared in her edited book, ''Feminist Thought and the Structure of Knowledge'' in 1988.  Later, her reader, ''Toward a New Psychology of Gender'' (1997), edited with Sara N. Davis, attempted to exemplify the new potentials for the field. Her work on gender issues is primarily [[qualitative research|qualitative]], with a special emphasis on [[narrative methods]].  A major focus of this work has been on gendered narratives, and their implications for women's careers. Her interest in narrative has recently led her to a concern with narratives of nature, and the human-environmental connection.

=== Performative psychology ===
Gergen has also been innovating in developing a field of performative psychology, in which dramatic presentations are featured as a way of both carrying out research and communicating with peers and public. A pioneer of this approach in psychology, her first solo performance, “From Mod-Masculinity to Post-Mod Macho: A Feminist Re-play” was presented at a symposium on ‘Postmodernity and Psychology” in Aarhus, [[Denmark]], June, 1989.  In her writing she also attempts to expand beyond conventional forms in order to bring forth multiple perspectives and to challenge existing forms of order.  Examples of this approach can be found in what may be her most important work, ''Reconstructing Psychology: Narrative, Gender and Performance'' (2001).

The '''metakosmia''' ({{lang-grc-gre|μετακόσμια}}; {{lang-la|intermundia}}), according to [[Epicurean]] philosophy were the relatively empty spaces in the [[Infinity|infinite]] [[Vacuum|void]] where worlds had not been formed by the joining together of the [[atoms]] through their endless motion. [[Epicurus]] held that the metakosmia were the abode of the [[god]]s, whom he considered to be immortal and blissful living beings made of atoms.

[[File:Martin Van Maele - La Grande Danse macabre des vifs - 01.jpg|thumb|Mooning can be used to express disrespect.]]
'''Mooning''' is the act of displaying one's bare [[buttocks]] by removing clothing, e.g., by lowering the backside of one's [[trousers]] and [[underpants]], usually bending over, whether also exposing the genitals or not. Mooning is used in the English-speaking world &lt;!-- see Talk:Mooning#geographic distribution --&gt; to express [[protest]], [[Contempt|scorn]], [[disrespect]], or provocation, or can be done for [[shock value]], [[fun]], or as a form of [[exhibitionism]]. 

Some jurisdictions regard mooning to be [[indecent exposure]], sometimes depending on the context.

==Word history==
''[[Moon]]'' has been a common shape metaphor for the [[buttocks]] in English since 1743, and the verb ''to moon'' has meant "to expose to (moon)light" since 1601.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nester |first=Daniel |title=How to be Inappropriate |publisher=Counterpoint Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-1593762537}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--, long before they were combined in US student slang in the verb(al expression) mooning "to flash the buttocks" in 1968. --&gt; As documented by McLaren, "'mooning', or exposing one's butt to shame an enemy ... had a long pedigree in peasant culture" throughout the [[Middle Ages]], and in many nations.&lt;ref name="McLaren"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Trials of Masculinity: Policing Sexual Boundaries, 1870-1930|first=Angus |last=McLaren |year=1997 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |page=186 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHTeeteHH1UC&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Mooning" is also defined as "wandering idly" and "romantically pining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=moon&amp;searchmode=term |title=Moon |work=The Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the practice of mooning was widespread by the 19th century, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates the use of "moon" and "mooning" to describe the act to student slang of the 1960s, when the gesture became increasingly popular among students at universities in the United States.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web|title=Mooning: A History|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/06/27/mooning_a_history_when_did_people_start_baring_their_butts_as_an_insult_.html|work=browbeat: Slate's culture blog|publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=July 11, 2012|author=Forrest Wickman|date=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
The legal position related to mooning varies between [[Jurisdiction (area)|jurisdictions]]; some consider it [[indecent exposure]], while others classify it as legal self expression.

==In various countries and cultures==

===Australia===
====Victoria====
In 2016, mooning in a public place in Victoria was made a criminal offence/something for which one could be punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|num_act|caoa201647o2016349|Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2016|24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
'''Whakapohane''' is the [[Māori people|Māori]] practice of baring one's buttocks with the intent to offend. It symbolises the birthing act and renders the recipient ''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)#Noa|noa]]'' ("base").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

She stood on the [[marae]] (sacred area) and the chief of the [[Te Arawa]] tribes, [[Mita Taupopoki]], objected telling her that she must get off ''his'' marae as she was a woman. She stood her ground and when he had finished his objections she defended her position. 

She said that she was descended from a prior-born ancestor than the chief. She was not on ''his'' marae; she was on ''her'' marae. She exposed her genitals, telling the chief that that was where he came from. Those assembled were asked to gainsay her speech but no one came forward. The Maori gesture of Whakapohane had countered the argument that was aimed at her.&lt;ref name="Salmond2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Salmond|title=Tears of Rangi: Experiments Across Worlds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXUsDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT526|date=24 July 2017|publisher=Auckland University Press|isbn=978-1-77558-923-5|pages=526–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

[[File:mooning.jpg|thumb|right|Students at [[Stanford University]] conduct a "mass mooning" in May 1995. This demonstration was in protest of [[censorship in the United States|censorship in the American media]].]]

In January 2006, a [[Maryland]] [[State court (United States)|state]] [[circuit court]] determined that mooning is a form of artistic expression protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as a form of [[freedom of speech|speech]].&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/03/AR2006010301509.html |work=Washington Post |title=Mooning Deemed 'Disgusting' but No Crime in Md. |last=Londoño |first=Ernesto |page=B01 |publisher=The Washington Post Company |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|page=B6|title=Judge rules 'mooning' is not illegal in Md.|date=January 6, 2006|publisher=[[Delaware News-Journal|The News Journal]], redistributed from the [[Associated Press]]|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The court ruled that [[indecent exposure]] relates only to exposure of the genitals, adding that even though mooning was a "disgusting" and "demeaning" act to engage in, and had taken place in the presence of a minor, "If exposure of half of the buttocks constituted indecent exposure, any woman wearing a [[Thong (clothing)|thong]] at the beach at [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]] would be guilty."&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;

Defense attorneys had cited a case from 1983 of a woman who was arrested after protesting in front of the [[United States Supreme Court building|U.S. Supreme Court building]] wearing nothing but a cardboard sign that covered the front of her body. In that case, the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] had ruled that indecent exposure is limited to a person's genitalia. No review of the case by a higher court took place since prosecutors dropped the case after the ruling.

In California, an appellate court found in December 2000 that mooning does not constitute indecent exposure (and, therefore, does not subject the defendant to [[sex offender]] registration laws) unless it can be proven beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct was sexually motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/california/caapp4th/85/937.html|title=In re Dallas W. (2000) 85 Cal. App. 4th 937 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 493]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2426">In [[ethics]], questions regarding the '''morality of violence''' ask under what conditions, if any, the use of [[violence]] can be morally justified. Three prominent views on the morality of violence are (1) the [[pacifist]] position, which states that violence is always immoral, and should never be used; (2) the [[utilitarian]] position, which states that violence can be used if it brings about a net "good" for society; (3) a hybrid of these two views which both looks at what good comes from the use of violence, while also examining the types of violence used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors=Rapoport, David C. &amp; Alexander, Yonah|title=The Morality of terrorism: religious and secular justifications|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-231-06752-2|page=383|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqlgBwP86YoC&amp;pg=PA383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Murder of June Anne Devaney''' was the murder of a girl aged 3 years 11 months which occurred on 15 May 1948 in which June Anne Devaney was abducted from her cot while an [[inpatient]] at [[Queen's Park Hospital]] in [[Blackburn, Lancashire]]. She was removed to the grounds of the hospital, where she was [[rape]]d, before suffering extensive [[blunt force trauma]] to her skull by enduring her head being repeatedly swung into a sandstone wall. This assault caused the child to suffer extensive internal injuries and multiple [[skull fracture]]s, causing June Anne to develop a fatal state of [[acute stress reaction|shock]]. Her murderer, 22-year-old Peter Griffiths, was arrested three months after the crime. He was subsequently tried and convicted of June Anne's murder and was [[hanging|hanged]] on 19 November 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

To solve the crime, police obtained the [[fingerprints]] of every male aged 16 and over who had been in the vicinity of Blackburn on the night of the murder to obtain the fingerprints of the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/foi-june2006.pdf |title=Freedom of Information: Records released as a result of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests|work= The National Archives|publisher= HM Government of the United Kingdom |format=PDF |date= June 2005|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation into the murder of June Anne Devaney would prove to be a milestone in the history of [[forensic science]]; this being the first time a mass [[fingerprinting]] exercise had been implemented to solve a murder in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpsociety.org.uk/news/JAD.html|title=The Fingerprint Society commemorates 60 years since landmark fingerprint identification|publisher=The Fingerprint Society|work=Fpsociety.org.uk|year=2008|accessdate=27 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306164019/http://www.fpsociety.org.uk/news/JAD.html|archivedate=6 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sixty years of fingerprints|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7573433.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 September 2012|format=Video|date=20 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mentalfloss.com/article/70263/history-first-mass-fingerprinting-operation ''mentalfloss.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
June Anne Devaney had been admitted to the [[East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust|Queen's Park Hospital]] in [[Blackburn, Lancashire]] on 5 May 1948, to recover from a mild bout of [[pneumonia]]. She was placed in ward CH3 of the premises.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/avalanche-journal-may-16-1948-p-1/ ''Avalanche Journal May 16, 1948'' p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after midnight on 15 May, nurse Gwendolyn Humphreys (who was in the ward's kitchen) heard a child's cry coming from the ward. She checked the ward, soothed the child and returned him to his cot, noting as she did so the child in the adjacent cot——June Anne Devaney —was sound asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then returned to her duties. At 1:20&amp;nbsp;am, she felt a draught and noticed an open door at the end of the ward. She closed it, and saw both that June Anne's cot was empty, and adult footprints—made by stockinged feet—were visible upon the highly waxed floor. Ominously, the drop side of the cot was still in place, meaning the child had to have been lifted from her cot.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Nurse Humphreys made a quick search of the ward, desperately attempting to find June Anne. After 30 minutes of fruitless searching, she contacted the local police. They arrived at 1:55&amp;nbsp;am and fully searched the hospital and its grounds, finding the child's body at 3:17&amp;nbsp;am. Her body lay face down in the grass alongside an {{convert|8|ft}} tall sandstone boundary wall some {{convert|300|ft|m}} from the ward,{{refn|group=n|The site where Devaney's body was discovered is now covered by the patients' car park of the [[East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust|Royal Blackburn Teaching Hospital]]}} and immediately apparent were extensive bloodstains and tearing to her nightdress, numerous [[skull fracture]]s, and blood exuding from her nostrils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basd.k12.wi.us/faculty/teverson/CASESTUDY--PETERGRIFFITHS.pdf ''Case Study: Peter Griffiths'']&lt;/ref&gt; The area where her body was discovered was promptly cordoned off, and at 4:20 a.m., the [[Chief Constable]] of Blackburn Police contacted [[Scotland Yard]], seeking the assistance of an experienced investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the child's body bore extensive injuries consistent with bludgeoning, the hospital became a crime scene, and the ward was secured and searched. A subsequent [[post mortem]] revealed that June Anne had died of [[acute stress reaction|shock]] due to both extensive internal injuries and multiple skull fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internal injuries were consistent with the child having been raped,&lt;ref&gt;''The Casebook of Forensic Detection: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Crimes'' p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; and the multiple, extensive fractures and [[blunt force trauma]] to her skull had been inflicted from the child being repeatedly swung into the boundary wall while her rapist and murderer had held her by her legs, ankles, or feet.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Numerous teeth marks were also notable on her left buttock, and puncture wounds were found on one ankle. Considering the area where the body was discovered, plus soon being contacted by a taxi driver who informed police that he had picked up a man with a [[Lancashire dialect and accent|local accent]] close to the hospital on the night of the crime, Blackburn Police came to believe early in the investigation that the crime would very likely have been committed by a local person, or an individual with extensive local geographical knowledge.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;

Beside Devaney's cot, a glass 1946 [[Boston round (bottle)|Winchester bottle]], partially filled with [[Water for injection|sterile water]], was found alongside further soiled footprints which were clearly visible on the highly polished hospital floor;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/a-brutal-murder-begins-an-unusual-investigation |title=A brutal murder begins an unusual investigation |publisher=History.com |work=This Day in History — 5/14/1948 |date= |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cotton"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?pageid=5144&amp;language=eng|title= The Murder of June Anne Devaney|publisher= |work= Cottontown.org|first= Lorna|last= Woodruff|date= |accessdate= 27 September 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120404071143/http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?language=eng&amp;pageID=5144|archivedate= 4 April 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, the pattern of these stockinged feet impressions evident throughout the ward revealed that June Anne's abductor and murderer had evidently removed his shoes after entering the premises before prowling throughout the ward to view each cot and bed before selecting June Anne's cot as the one from which he chose to abduct his victim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basd.k12.wi.us/faculty/teverson/CASESTUDY--PETERGRIFFITHS.pdf ''Case Study: Peter Griffiths'']&lt;/ref&gt; The bottle itself had inexplicably been removed from its customary place (a trolley at the end of the ward) and placed beside the child's cot. This bottle itself was examined for fingerprints, being found to contain several sets.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
After all hospital staff had their fingerprints compared against those upon the bottle,{{refn|group=n|Initial comparison had begun with all persons with general access to the hospital itself—2,017 persons in all. Of these persons, 642 had specific access to the children's ward. All were checked, and all were eliminated from the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;''The Casebook of Forensic Detection: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Crimes'' p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;}} a team of detectives from the [[Lancashire Constabulary]] traced all individuals who could have had a legitimate reason to have been in the ward within two years prior to the murder for the purposes of both [[alibi]] tracing, and fingerprint comparison, before all were eliminated as suspects. Following the completion of this exhaustive task, one unidentified set of fingerprints remained. This set of fingerprints was declared by the head of the Lancashire Fingerprint Bureau to have belonged to the child's murderer.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide'' p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

After first establishing that no match for this set of fingerprints could be found within the police fingerprint bureau—meaning the perpetrator had not previously been convicted of any crime—attention turned to every male at or over the age of 16 within the local community. In a joint effort between local police forces and senior detectives from Scotland Yard, the [[Chief Inspector#United Kingdom|Detective Chief Inspector]] in charge of the investigation, DCI John Capstick, then proposed that every male at or over the age of 16 who lived or was in the vicinity of Blackburn (then a town of 123,000 inhabitants) between 14 and 15 May be fingerprinted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public were asked to cooperate with police throughout this undertaking, with the promise that all records obtained would not be compared for usage in other cases, and that these records would be destroyed at the completion of this task.{{refn|group=n|All records obtained were destroyed just weeks prior to the execution of the perpetrator of the crime. They would be destroyed in a mass [[Pulp (paper)|pulping]] exercise at a local [[papermill]], with the local press present to record the destruction of the records.&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;}}

The mass operation began, and a special card was developed so that the identifiable sections of the perpetrator's left hand found upon the bottle (the left [[forefinger]], [[middle finger]], [[ring finger]] and a section of the left palm) could be recorded swiftly. The card also recorded the individual's name, address, and [[National Identity Registration Number]]. Also on the card was a section pertaining to the individual's movements between 11 p.m. on 14 May and 2 a.m. 15 May.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.nhs.uk/services/1939-register-service |title=1939 Register Service |publisher=NHS Information Centre |date= |accessdate=4 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109164823/http://www.ic.nhs.uk/services/1939-register-service |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The task-force to carry out this endeavour was led by Inspector W. Barton and comprised a team of 20 officers who, armed with details from the [[Electoral Register]], set about the districts collecting fingerprints and comparing them against those upon the Winchester bottle. Over the course of two months, over 40,000 sets of prints were taken from more than 35,000 homes without a match being found.{{refn|group=n|Such was the level of public outrage generated by the murder of June Anne Devaney, that throughout the duration of this mammoth task, only very seldom did officers encounter a refusal by a member of the public to submit his fingerprints for comparison with those upon the Winchester bottle. On the rare instance a member of the public did refuse to give his fingerprints, this individual was visited by a senior police officer, who in each instance, succeeded in obtaining the individual's fingerprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Upon completion of this exercise in late July, police then concentrated on people who had not been listed upon the Electoral Register. By way of checking the issue of [[Rationing|ration books]] and the Registration Number of the individual by which they and their owners were identified, officers began tracing all male individuals whose fingerprints had not yet been collected.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison===
One of the Blackburn addresses to be checked on 11 August was that of Peter Griffiths, a 22-year-old ex-serviceman who lived in Briley Street, and who worked as a packer on the night shift at a local flour mill. When asked to provide his fingerprints for comparison, Griffiths—whose niece had been in Queen's Park Hospital at the time June Anne had been abducted&lt;ref&gt;''The Casebook of Forensic Detection: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Crimes'' p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;—supplied them without hesitation.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; At 3:00 p.m. on 12 August, a comparison for the fingerprints upon the Winchester bottle was made with the fingerprints obtained from Peter Griffiths.&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;

By the time this comparison had been made, officers had taken 46,253 sets of fingerprints, and had less than 200 sets of prints left to check before the completion of their task.

==Arrest==
Peter Griffiths was arrested by DCI Capstick as he left his Blackburn home to attend work on the evening of 12 August.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken to Blackburn Police Headquarters, where he was formally [[Police caution|cautioned]] as to his right to silence. During the ride to police headquarters, and throughout his first interview, Griffiths attempted to deny any involvement,&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; although when confronted with the fact his fingerprints had been a perfect match for those upon the bottle, he turned towards DCI Capstick and stated: "Well, if they are my fingerprints on the bottle, I'll tell you all about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confession===
In the statement he subsequently gave to detectives, Griffiths claimed that on the night of the 14th, he had chosen to go for a night's "drinking alone" in Blackburn, and that as a result of his heavy drinking, by [[Last call (bar term)|closing time]], he had become severely [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]].{{refn|group=n|Griffiths claimed to have drank at least 11 pints of [[Bitter (beer)|bitter]], two double [[Shot glass|shots]] of rum,&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; and one pint of [[Guinness]] on the night he killed June Anne Devaney.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;}} He had then chosen to walk around in an attempt to "[[Sobriety|sober up]]" before returning home. Griffiths then claimed to have spoken with a man in a parked car, whom he had asked to light his (Griffiths') cigarette. According to Griffiths, this man, noting his state of intoxication, had said to him: "Get in, open the window and I'll give you a spin."&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; This man had soon parked his car in close proximity to Queen's Park Hospital, and it had been at this stage at which Griffiths had chosen to break into the premises to commit his crime.{{refn|group=n|This claim to have been offered a lift by an unknown stranger in a car was called into question by a taxi driver who informed investigators that on the night of the murder, he had given a lift to a man matching Griffith's description, who had specifically requested to be driven to a quarry located adjacent to the Queen's Park Hospital. This taxi driver's account, if correct, suggests the murder of June Anne was [[premeditation|premeditated]] from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;''Real-Life Crimes'' (1993) ISSN 9-771354-950013&lt;/ref&gt;}} He had, he stated, picked up the Winchester bottle to use as a weapon in the event any member of staff had attempted to challenge him after he had entered the premises, before he had chosen June Anne as his victim.

Griffiths refused to talk in much detail as to the atrocities he inflicted upon the child, beyond claiming that he had killed June Anne in a fit of rage when she had begun crying after he had carried her from the premises. Nonetheless, in one section of his statement, Griffiths stated that as he had carried the child across the field to where he assaulted and murdered her, June Anne had trustingly placed her arms around his neck. Although he showed no remorse for his actions (which he blamed upon his state of intoxication) throughout the course of his confession, he did end his formal statement with a sentence indicating he wished to be [[hanging|hanged]] for his crime: "I hope I get what I deserve."&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' pp. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 13 August, Peter Griffiths was formally charged with the murder of June Anne Devaney.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond providing investigators with a further set of his fingerprints and foot impressions for additional comparison with those upon the Winchester bottle and upon the floor of the ward of the Queen's Park Hospital, he would refuse to cooperate with all subsequent requests either to discuss aspects of his crime, or to provide blood or pubic hair samples for additional comparison with samples obtained at the crime scene prior to his upcoming trial; simply making statements to the effect of, "I don't wish to say anything" when these requests were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Griffiths' confession, he was immediately [[remand (court procedure)|remanded into custody]] at [[HM Prison Liverpool|Walton Gaol]] to await trial.

To both substantiate Griffiths' confession, and to garner further evidence, investigators went to his house to conduct a thorough search. During this search, a ticket was found from a local [[pawnbroker]], dated 31 May 1948, for a suit belonging to Griffiths. Police collected this suit, only for the police forensics laboratory to discover that it bore bloodstains in several locations on both the jacket and trousers. These bloodstains were found to be the same blood type of June Anne Devaney—[[ABO blood group system|type A]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, fibres from this suit proved to be a perfect match to fibres found upon the child's body, clothing, and the window ledge where her murderer had entered the hospital,&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; thus proving this to have been the suit Griffiths had been wearing on the night of the crime.

==Trial==
The trial of Peter Griffiths began on 15 October 1948. He was tried before Mr. Justice Oliver at the [[assizes|assize court]] of [[Lancaster Castle|Lancaster]],&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt; and chose to enter a formal plea of [[plea|not guilty]] to the charge of murder on this date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those to testify on behalf of the prosecution was Inspector Colin Campbell, who testified as to the prints on the Winchester bottle being a precise match for the samples Griffiths had twice provided for investigators, and which he readily acknowledged were his own. To demonstrate this, enlarged copies of both sets of fingerprints were displayed to the jury, with Inspector Campbell indicating 16 ridge characteristics which were in agreement on both sets of impressions. Inspector Campbell also testified as to the stockinged feet impressions Griffiths had provided for investigators also being remarkably similar in characteristics with those found upon the ward from which June Anne had been abducted. Also to testify on behalf of the prosecution were individuals who described how the suit Griffiths had pawned shortly after the murder was found to be heavily bloodstained in several locations on both the jacket and trousers, and that these bloodstains were of the same blood type of June Anne Devaney. The jurors were told how fibres from this suit were of a perfect match to fibres found on the child's clothing, body, and on the window ledge where her murderer had evidently entered the hospital. None of these experts were [[cross-examination|cross-examined]] by Griffiths' defence counsel.

During the trial, Griffiths' defence counsel openly stated they were not fighting for his freedom, but for his life (murder being a [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital offence]] in the United Kingdom at the time). As Griffiths had already pleaded guilty to the offence,&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; all that remained was a question of his sanity, and as such, the defence had entered a plea of [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]]. This opinion was voiced by Dr. Alaistair Robertson Grant, who stated for the defence that Griffiths was displaying the early signs of [[schizophrenia]] (a condition for which he had treated Griffiths' father some thirty years previously when he had been hospitalised with the condition). Dr. Grant stated to the jury that although Griffiths knew what he was doing, he did not realise the criminality of his actions. To refute this testimony, the prosecution produced the medical officer from Walton Gaol, a Dr. F.H. Brisby. Dr. Brisby testified on 18 October as to his observations of Griffiths while he had been held on [[remand (detention)|remand]] since 14 August. He stated that, based on his observations of Griffiths throughout his incarceration, Griffiths was sane when he had committed the crime.&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;

During the trial, Griffiths described how he had entered the hospital while intoxicated, and had then picked up the Winchester sterile water bottle, which he stated to the Court he had intended to use as a weapon if he was challenged. He also described how he had lifted June Anne Devaney from her cot and then carried her, in his right arm, out of the hospital, down the field to where he had proceeded to beat and rape her, adding that the child had trustingly placed her arms around his neck as he had carried her to this destination. Although he confessed to having swung the child's head into the boundary wall approximately four times, Griffiths made no response when he was specifically asked about the sexual aspect of the assault. (After hearing Griffiths' recollection of the events, Dr. Alaistair Grant privately conceded that Griffiths was of [[Sanity|sound mind]].&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;)

The trial lasted for two days. Following [[closing argument]]s delivered by both counsels, the jury retired to consider their verdict, although they would deliberate for just 23 minutes&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; before announcing they had reached their verdict.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Griffiths was found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of June Anne Devaney's murder. In response to this verdict, Mr. Justice Oliver donned his formal [[black cap]] and made the following speech:

{{cquote|Peter Griffiths, this jury has found you guilty of a crime of the most brutal ferocity. I entirely agree with their verdict. The sentence of the Court is that you be taken from this place to a lawful prison and thence to a place of execution, and that you there suffer death by hanging [...] and may the Lord have mercy on your soul.&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;}}

Peter Griffiths did not lodge an appeal against his conviction. He was hanged at [[HM Prison Liverpool|Liverpool Prison]] on 19 November 1948. His body was later buried within the confines of the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishexecutions.co.uk/execution-content.php?key=751 |title=Peter Griffiths - 1948 |publisher=BritishExecutions.co.uk |date=19 November 1948 |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2960">A '''networked narrative''', also known as a '''network narrative''' or '''distributed narrative''', is a [[narrative]] partitioned across a network of interconnected authors, access points, and/or discrete [[Narrative thread|threads]]. It is not driven by the specificity of details; rather, details emerge through a co-construction of the ultimate story by the various participants or elements.

== Networked narratives as decentralized stories ==

Networked narratives can be seen as being defined by their rejection of narrative unity.&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt; As a consequence, such narratives escape the constraints of centralized authorship, distribution, and storytelling. One of the most visible forms of networked narrative has been the [[alternate reality game]], an interactive scenario that is experienced through multiple channels and adapts to player behavior. Additionally, networked narratives have been represented in [[film]]s such as [[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]] and [[Syriana]] through highly decentralized, threaded plots.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt;

== Networked narratives as social movements ==

Marco Deseriis breaks down networked narratives in three central functions: denotative, performing, and pragmatic.&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; He claims that socially-created networked narratives:

1. Represent an initially unsolved conflict, dilemma, or other situation.&lt;br&gt;
2. Invite viewers to perform a role in the story.&lt;br&gt;
3. Are oriented around a system of beliefs or ethics that resonating with participants and allows them to create new stories.

[[Internet activism]], [[hacktivism]], and the [[free software movement]] are principal examples of such narratives in practice. While adherents to these movements tend to share a common ethos, there is no central authority - the direction of the narrative hinges on its participants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7056">'''Nietzschean affirmation''' ({{lang-de|Bejahung}}), also known as '''affirmation of life''',&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Reginster, ''The Affirmation of Life: Nietzsche on Overcoming Nihilism'', Harvard University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept in the [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The best example of this concept can be found in Nietzsche's ''The Will to Power'':

{{quote|If we affirm one single moment, we thus affirm not only ourselves but all existence. For nothing is self-sufficient, neither in us ourselves nor in things; and if our soul has trembled with happiness and sounded like a harp string just once, all eternity was needed to produce this one event—and in this single moment of affirmation all eternity was called good, redeemed, justified, and affirmed.|sign=Nietzsche, Friedrich|source=''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' ([[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] and [[R. J. Hollingdale]] translators). New York: Random House, 1967. pages 532–533&lt;ref&gt;Original German: ''Gesetzt, wir sagen Ja zu einem einzigen Augenblick, so haben wir damit nicht nur zu uns selbst, sondern zu allem Dasein Ja gesagt. Denn es steht Nichts für sich, weder in uns selbst noch in den Dingen: und wenn nur ein einziges Mal unsre Seele wie eine Saite vor Glück gezittert und getönt hat, so waren alle Ewigkeiten nöthig, um dies Eine Geschehen zu bedingen – und alle Ewigkeit war in diesem einzigen Augenblick unseres Jasagens gutgeheißen, erlöst, gerechtfertigt und bejaht.'' (''Wille zur Macht'', [http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/6182/12 Nr. 1032].)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Opposition to Schopenhauer==
[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] wrote that Nietzsche "celebrates the Greeks who, facing up to the terrors of nature and history, did not seek refuge in "a [[Buddhism|Buddhistic]] negation of the will," as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] did, but instead created [[Tragedy|tragedies]] in which life is affirmed as beautiful in spite of everything."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "Friedrich Nietzsche," vol. 5, Macmillan, New York, 1967, p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Original German: "''buddhistischen Verneinung des Willens''" (Nietzsche, ''[[Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik]]'', [http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Nietzsche,+Friedrich/Die+Geburt+der+Trag%C3%B6die/Die+Geburt+der+Trag%C3%B6die+aus+dem+Geiste+der+Musik/1-10 § 7]).&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer’s negation of the will was a saying "no" to life and to the world, which he judged to be a scene of pain and [[evil]]. "[D]irectly against Schopenhauer’s place as the ultimate nay-sayer to life, Nietzsche positioned himself as the ultimate yes-sayer&amp;hellip;."&lt;ref&gt;''A Companion to Schopenhauer'', edited by Bart Vandenabeele, Part IV, ch. 19, article by [[Ken Gemes]] and [[Christopher Janaway]], "Life-Denial versus Life-Affirmation: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche on [[Pessimism]] and [[Asceticism]]," [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]], New York, 2012, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche’s affirmation of life's pain and evil, in opposition to Schopenhauer, resulted from an overflow of life.&lt;ref&gt;"I was the first to see the actual contrast: the degenerate instinct which turns upon life with  a subterranean lust of vengeance ([[Christianity]], Schopenhauer's philosophy, and in some respects too even [[Plato]]'s philosophy — in short, the whole of [[idealism]] in its typical forms), as opposed to a formula of the highest yea-saying to life, born of an abundance and a superabundance of life — a yea-saying free from all reserve, applying even to suffering, and guilt, and all that is questionable and strange in existence." (Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', Preface, § 5)&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer’s advocacy of self-denial and negation of life was, according to Nietzsche, very harmful.&lt;ref&gt;"For me the issue was the value of morality—and in that matter I had to take issue almost alone with my great teacher Schopenhauer&amp;hellip;. The most specific issue was the worth of the 'unegoistic,' the instinct for pity, self-denial, self-sacrifice, something which Schopenhauer himself had painted with gold, deified, and projected into the next world for so long that it finally remained for him 'value in itself' and the reason why he said No to life and even to himself. But a constantly more fundamental suspicion of these very instincts voiced itself in me, a [[scepticism]] which always dug deeper! It was precisely here that I saw the great danger to humanity, its most sublime temptation and seduction." (Nietzsche, ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', "Why I Write Such Good Books," "The Birth of Tragedy," § 2.)&lt;/ref&gt; For his entire mature life, Nietzsche was concerned with the damage that he thought resulted from Schopenhauerian disgust with life and turning against the world.

==Derridean interpretation==
[[Jacques Derrida]] allocates this concept and applies it specifically to language, its structure and play. This application acknowledges that there is, in fact, no center or origin within language and its many parts, no firm ground from which to base any Truth or truths. This shock allows for two reactions in Derrida’s philosophy: the more negative, melancholic response, which he designates as Rousseauistic, or the more positive Nietzschean affirmation. [[Rousseau]]'s perspective focuses on deciphering the truth and [[origin of language]] and its many signs, an often exhaustive occupation. Derrida's response to Nietzsche, however, offers an active participation with these signs and arrives at, in Derridean philosophy, a more resolute response to language.

In "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences|Structure, Sign, and Play]]", Derrida articulates Nietzsche’s perspective as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... the joyous affirmation of the play of the world and of the innocence of becoming, the affirmation of a world of signs without fault, without truth, and without origin which is offered to an active interpretation.&lt;ref name="derrida"&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Humanities." ''[[Writing and Difference]]''. Trans. Alan Bass. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1978. 278–293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essentially, Derrida not only fosters Nietzsche’s work but evolves it within the sphere of language; in doing so, Derrida acquires and employs Nietzsche’s optimism in his concept of play: "the ''substitution'' of ''given'' and ''existing'', ''present'', pieces" (292).&lt;ref name="derrida"/&gt; Much of this spirit resides in the abandonment of any sort of new [[humanism]]. This acceptance of the inevitable allows for considerable relief—evident in the designation of the loss of center as a non-center—as well as the opportunity to affirm and cultivate play, which enables humanity and the humanities "to pass beyond man and humanism" (292).&lt;ref name="derrida"/&gt;

The '''Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom''', or '''Prayer Pilgrimage to Washington''', was a 1957 demonstration in [[Washington, D.C.]], an early event in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and the occasion for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s "[[Give Us the Ballot]]" speech.

==Background==
The demonstration was planned at the occasion of the third anniversary of the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', a landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision against [[Racial segregation|segregation]] in public schools. The event organizers urged the government to abide by that decision, as the process of desegregation was being obstructed at local and state levels.

The march was organized by [[A. Philip Randolph]],&lt;ref name=crdl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crdl.usg.edu/voci/go/crdl/events/viewEvent/1055;jsessionid=B965F35467CE28610711C596B4E1E0E4 |title=Prayer Pilgrimage for freedom, Washington, D.C. |author=Civil Rights Digital Library |accessdate=March 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227025609/http://crdl.usg.edu/voci/go/crdl/events/viewEvent/1055 |archivedate=December 27, 2008 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Bayard Rustin]],&lt;ref name=mlk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_prayer_pilgrimage_for_freedom_1957/ |title=Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom (1957) |author=The Martin Luther King Jr. Encyclopedia |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ella Baker]]. It was supported by the [[NAACP]] and the recently founded [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]. Congressman [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.]] had asked the planners not to embarrass the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]], thus the event was organized as a prayer commemoration.&lt;ref name=mlk/&gt; A call for the demonstration was issued on April 5, 1957, by Randolph, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Roy Wilkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_prayer_pilgrimage_for_freedom_1957/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The event==
The three-hour demonstration took place in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Harry Belafonte]] participated in the event. [[Paul Robeson]] and his wife [[Eslanda Robeson|Eslanda]] attended, but were largely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Martin Duberman]]| title=Paul Robeson |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf, 1988| page=447f| isbn=0-394-52780-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the speakers were Wilkins, [[Mordecai Johnson]], and King. King was the last speaker and it was the first time that he addressed a national audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2008/03/31/in_depth_us/timeline3982827_0_content.shtml CBS: May 17, 1957]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis57.htm |title=Prayer Pilgrimage to DC for Civil Rights| author=Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement |accessdate= March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his first Lincoln Memorial speech and it set the goal and agenda for voting rights as an important part of the civil rights struggle against a reluctant administration.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/180471/page/1 |author=David J. Garrow |title=An Unfinished Dream |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=January 19, 2009 | accessdate=March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 25,000 demonstrators attended the event to pray and voice their opinion. At the time, the event was the largest demonstration ever organized for civil rights.

==="Give Us the Ballot"===
{{Main|Give Us the Ballot}}

King's oratory at the event is named the "Give Us the Ballot" speech, as its key section uses this demand as a [[litany]], followed by a listing of changes that would result by African Americans regaining voting rights: 
 
{{quote|Give us the ballot and we will no longer have to worry the federal government about our basic rights...

Give us the ballot and we will no longer plead to the federal government for passage of an anti-lynching law...

Give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with men of good will...

Give us the ballot and we will place judges on the benches of the South who will do justly and love mercy...

Give us the ballot and we will quietly and nonviolently, without rancor or bitterness, implement the Supreme Court's decision of May 17, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stanford.edu/group/King/publications/papers/vol4/570517.004-Give_Us_the_Ballot.htm "Give Us the Ballot" Speech] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724041234/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/publications/papers/vol4/570517.004-Give_Us_the_Ballot.htm |date=2008-07-24 }}, Martin Luther King Papers, Vol. 4, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is one of King's major speeches.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;

==Results==
With his oratory King established himself as the "No. 1 leader of 16 million Negroes" (James L. Hicks, ''[[Amsterdam News]]'').&lt;ref name=mlk&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/kingpapers/article/prayer_pilgrimage_for_freedom_1957/| title=Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom (1957) |author=The Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute| accessdate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=King Came Preaching: The Pulpit Power of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. |author=Mervyn A.

The organizers gained experience and the march laid the foundation for further larger Civil Rights Movement demonstrations in Washington.&lt;ref name=crdl/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22414">In [[metaphysics]], the '''problem of universals''' refers to the question of whether properties exist, and if so, what they are.&lt;ref name="Moreland, Universals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moreland|first=J.P.|title=Universals|year=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=0773522697|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[property (philosophy)|Properties]] are qualities or relations that two or more entities have in common. The various kinds of properties, such as qualities and [[relation (philosophy)|relations]], are referred to as [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]. For instance, one can imagine three cup holders on a table that have in common the quality of ''being circular'' or ''exemplifying circularity'',&lt;ref&gt;Loux (1998), p. 20; (2001), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; or two daughters that have in common ''being the female offsprings of Frank.'' There are many such properties, such as being human, red, male or female, liquid, big or small, taller than, father of, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Loux (2001), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

While philosophers agree that human beings talk and think about properties, they disagree on whether these universals exist in [[reality]] or merely in thought and speech.

==Positions&lt;!--'Extreme realism' and 'Strong realism' redirect here--&gt;==
There are many philosophical positions regarding universals. Taking "beauty" as example, three positions are:
* [[Platonic realism]] (also called "'''extreme realism'''"&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Herbert Hochberg, "Nominalism and Idealism," ''Axiomathes'', June 2013, '''23'''(2), pp. 213–234.&lt;/ref&gt;): beauty is a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or description.
* [[Aristotelian realism]] (also called "'''strong realism'''"&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;): beauty is a property that exists only when beautiful things exist.
* [[Anti-realism]]: beauty is a property constructed in the mind, so exists only in descriptions of things.

Extreme realism and strong realism are also known as [[exaggerated realism]] and [[moderate realism]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism|Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism – ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)]]&lt;/ref&gt; A notable variant of anti-realism is [[nominalism]].&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt;

===Realism&lt;!--Linked from 'Philosophical realism'--&gt;===
{{main|Metaphysical realism}}
The realist school claims that universals are real—they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them. There are various forms of realism. Two major forms are [[Platonic realism]] (''universalia ante res'') and [[Aristotelian realism]] (''universalia in rebus'').&lt;ref&gt;Price (1953), among others, sometimes uses such Latin terms.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Platonic realism'' is the view that universals are real entities existing independent of particulars. ''Aristotelian realism'', on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.

Realists tend to argue that universals must be posited as distinct entities in order to account for various phenomena. For example, a common realist argument, supposedly found in Plato, is that universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false. Take the sentence "[[Djivan Gasparyan]] is a musician". The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual, Djivan Gasparyan, who possesses a certain quality: musicianship. Thus it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property.&lt;ref&gt;(MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein, 2006, §1b)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominalism&lt;!--&lt;!--linked from 'Anti-realism'--&gt;===
{{main|Nominalism}}
Nominalists assert that only individuals or particulars exist and deny that universals are real (i.e. that they exist as entities or beings; ''universalia post res''). The term "nominalism" comes from the Latin ''nomen'' ("name"), since the nominalist philosopher agrees that we predicate the same property of multiple entities but argues that the entities only share a name, not a real quality, in common. There are various forms of nominalism; four major varieties are [[predicate nominalism]], [[resemblance nominalism]], [[trope nominalism]], and [[conceptualism]].&lt;ref name="IEP"/&gt; 

Nominalists often argue for their view by claiming that nominalism can account for all the relevant phenomena, and therefore—by [[Occam's razor]] or some sort of principle of simplicity—nominalism is preferable, since it posits fewer entities.

Nominalism has been endorsed or defended by many, including [[Chrysippus]],&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: "[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Ockham]], [[Rudolf Carnap]],&lt;ref name=:0&gt;[https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/resemblance-nominalism-a-solution-to-the-problem-of-universals/ "Review of Gonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra, ''Resemblance Nominalism: A Solution to the Problem of Universals''" – ndpr.nd.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nelson Goodman]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goodman/supplement.html "Nelson Goodman: The Calculus of Individuals in its different versions", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; [[H. H. Price]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; and [[D. C. Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/ Donald Cary Williams, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcendental idealism===
{{main|Transcendental idealism}}
{{see also|German idealism}}

[[Transcendental idealist]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] posited that universals are not real, but are ideas in the mind of rational beings. Transcendental idealists do not reject universals as arbitrary names; rather, they treat universals as fundamental categories of pure reason (or as secondary concepts derived from those fundamental categories). Universals, in transcendental idealism, are intrinsically tied to the rationality of the subject making the judgment.

Thus, for transcendental idealists, the problem of universals is only tangentially a metaphysical problem; it is more of a problem of [[psychology]] and [[epistemology]]. Kant's position has been interpreted as a conceptualist one.&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient philosophy==

===Plato===
[[Plato]] believed there to be a sharp distinction between the world of perceivable objects and the world of universals or [[substantial form|forms]]: one can only have mere opinions about the former, but one can have [[knowledge]] about the latter.  For Plato it was not possible to have knowledge of anything that could change or was particular, since knowledge had to be forever unfailing and general.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §1b.&lt;/ref&gt;  For that reason, the world of the forms is the real world, like [[Allegory of the cave|sunlight]], while the sensible world is only imperfectly or partially real, like [[Allegory of the cave|shadows]]. This [[Platonic realism]], however, in denying that the [[theory of forms|eternal Forms]] are mental artifacts, differs sharply with modern forms of idealism.

One of the first nominalist critiques of Plato's realism was that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said "I've seen Plato's cups and table, but not his cupness and tableness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Guy|others=Translated by Guy Davenport|title=Herakleitos and Diogenes|publisher=Grey Fox Press|location=Bolinas|year=1979|pages=57|isbn=0-912516-35-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] disagreed with his tutor. Aristotle transformed Plato's forms into "[[Four causes#Formal cause|formal causes]]", the blueprints or [[essence]]s of individual things. Whereas Plato idealized [[geometry]], Aristotle emphasized [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] and related disciplines and therefore much of his thinking concerns living beings and their properties. The nature of universals in Aristotle's philosophy therefore hinges on his view of [[natural kind]]s.

Consider for example a particular [[oak]] tree. This is a member of a species and it has much in common with other oak trees, past, present and future. Its universal, its oakness, is a part of it. A biologist can study oak trees and learn about oakness and more generally the intelligible order within the sensible world. Accordingly, Aristotle was more confident than Plato about coming to know the sensible world; he was a prototypical [[Empiricism|empiricist]] and a founder of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. Aristotle was a new, [[Moderate realism|moderate]] sort of realist about universals.

==Medieval philosophy==

===Boethius===
The problem was introduced to the medieval world by [[Boethius]], by his translation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s [[Isagoge]]. It begins:

"I shall omit to speak about genera and species, as to whether they subsist (in the nature of things) or in mere conceptions only; whether also if subsistent, they are bodies or incorporeal, and whether they are separate from, or in, sensibles, and subsist about these, for such a treatise is most profound, and requires another more extensive investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_isagogue_02_translation.htm|title=Porphyry, Introduction (or Isagoge) to the logical Categories of Aristotle (1853) vol. 2. pp.609-633.|first=|last=Porphyry|date=|website=www.tertullian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duns Scotus===
[[Duns Scotus]] argued strongly against both nominalism and conceptualism, arguing instead for [[Scotist realism]], a medieval response to the conceptualism of Abelard.

===Ockham===
[[William of Ockham]] argued strongly that universals are a product of abstract human thought. According to Ockham, universals are just words/names that only exist in the mind and have no real place in the external world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/ockham/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Spade|first=Paul Vincent|last2=Panaccio|first2=Claude|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval realism===
{{main|Medieval realism}}
Realism was argued for by both [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. Aquinas argued that both the essence of a thing and its existence were clearly distinct;&lt;ref&gt;On Being and Essence, Ch I.&lt;/ref&gt; in this regard he is close to the teaching of Aristotle. [[Scotist realism]] argues that in a thing there is no real distinction between the essence and the existence, instead there is only a [[Formal distinction]].&lt;ref&gt;Opus Oxoniense I iii 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these opinions were denied by Scotus' pupil William of Ockham.

===Medieval nominalism===
{{main|Medieval nominalism}}
In [[medieval philosophy]], the French philosopher and [[Theology|theologian]] [[Roscellinus]] (c. 1050 – c. 1125) was an early, prominent proponent of nominalism.

==Modern and contemporary philosophy==

===Mill===
{{also|Psychologism}}
The 19th-century British philosophy [[John Stuart Mill]] discussed the problem of universals in the course of a book that eviscerated the philosophy of Sir [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]. Mill wrote, "The formation of a concept does not consist in separating the attributes which are said to compose it from all other attributes of the same object and enabling us to conceive those attributes, disjoined from any others. We neither conceive them, nor think them, nor cognize them in any way, as a thing apart, but solely as forming, in combination with numerous other attributes, the idea of an individual object".

However, he then proceeds to state that Berkeley's position is factually wrong by stating the following:

{{Quotation |But, though meaning them only as part of a larger agglomeration, we have the power of fixing our attention on them, to the neglect of the other attributes with which we think them combined. While the concentration of attention lasts, if it is sufficiently intense, we may be temporarily unconscious of any of the other attributes and may really, for a brief interval, have nothing present to our mind but the attributes constituent of the concept.|as quoted in William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}

In other words, we may be "temporarily unconscious" of whether an image is white, black or yellow and concentrate our attention on the fact that it is a man and on just those attributes necessary to identify it as a man (but not as any particular one). It may then have the significance of a universal of manhood.

===Peirce===
The 19th-century American logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], known as the father of [[pragmatism]], developed his own views on the problem of universals in the course of a review of an edition of the writings of George Berkeley. Peirce begins with the observation that "Berkeley's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1871), Review: Fraser's Edition of the ''Works of George Berkeley'' in ''North American Review'' 113(October):449-72, reprinted in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]]'' v. 8, paragraphs 7-38 and in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce]]'' v. 2, pp. 462-486. ''Peirce Edition Project'' [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_48/v2_48.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; He includes among these paradoxical doctrines Berkeley's denial of "the possibility of forming the simplest general conception". He wrote that if there is some mental fact that works ''in practice'' the way that a universal would, that fact is a universal. "If I have learned a formula in gibberish which in any way jogs my memory so as to enable me in each single case to act as though I had a general idea, what possible utility is there in distinguishing between such a gibberish... and an idea?" Peirce also held as a matter of [[ontology]] that what he called "thirdness", the more general facts about the world, are extra-mental realities.

===James===
[[William James]] learned pragmatism, this way of understanding an idea by its practical effects, from his friend Peirce, but he gave it new significance. (Which was not to Peirce's taste - he came to complain that James had "kidnapped" the term and eventually to call himself a "pragmaticist" instead.) Although James certainly agreed with Peirce and against Berkeley that general ideas exist as a psychological fact, he was a nominalist in his ontology:

{{Quotation | From every point of view, the overwhelming and portentous character ascribed to universal conceptions is surprising. Why, from Plato and Aristotle, philosophers should have vied with each other in scorn of the knowledge of the particular and in adoration of that of the general, is hard to understand, seeing that the more adorable knowledge ought to be that of the more adorable things and that the things of worth are all concretes and singulars. The only value of universal characters is that they help us, by reasoning, to know new [[truth]]s about individual things.|William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}

There are at least three ways in which a realist might try to answer James' challenge of explaining the reason why universal conceptions are more lofty than those of particulars:  the moral/political answer, the mathematical/scientific answer, and the anti-paradoxical answer. Each has contemporary or near-contemporary advocates.

===Weaver===
The moral or political response is given by the conservative philosopher [[Richard M. Weaver]] in ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' (1948), where he describes how the acceptance of "the fateful doctrine of nominalism" was "the crucial event in the history of Western culture; from this flowed those acts which issue now in modern decadence".&lt;ref name="Hoeveler1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. David Hoeveler|title=Watch on the right: conservative intellectuals in the Reagan era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JocfGWYGciMC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=15 February 1991|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-12810-4|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotchie1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Scotchie|title=The vision of Richard Weaver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHUZ7Mjv4WMC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-56000-212-3|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cocchiarella===
[[Nino Cocchiarella]] put forward the idea that realism is the best response to certain logical paradoxes to which nominalism leads ("Nominalism and Conceptualism as Predicative Second Order Theories of Predication", ''[[Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic]]'', vol. 21 (1980)). It is noted that in a sense Cocchiarella has adopted Platonism for anti-Platonic reasons. Plato, as seen in the dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', was willing to accept a certain amount of paradox with his forms. Cocchiarella adopts the forms to avoid paradox.

===Armstrong===
The Australian philosopher [[David Malet Armstrong]] has been one of the leading realists in the twentieth century, and has used a concept of universals to build a naturalistic and scientifically realist ontology. In both ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' (1978) and ''Universals: An Opinionated Introduction'' (1989), Armstrong describes the relative merits of a number of nominalist theories which appeal either to "natural classes" (a view he ascribes to [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]]), concepts, resemblance relations or predicates, and also discusses non-realist "trope" accounts (which he describes in the ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' volumes as "particularism"). He gives a number of reasons to reject all of these, but also dismisses a number of realist accounts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5406">In [[mathematics]], a '''pseudogroup''' is an extension of the [[group (mathematics)|group]] concept, but one that grew out of the geometric approach of [[Sophus Lie]], rather than out of [[abstract algebra]] (such as [[quasigroup]], for example). A theory of pseudogroups was developed by [[Élie Cartan]] in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Élie|last = Cartan|title = Sur la structure des groupes infinis de transformations|journal = Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure|year = 1904|volume = 21|pages=153–206|url=http://archive.numdam.org/article/ASENS_1904_3_21__153_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Élie|last = Cartan|title = Les groupes de transformations continus, infinis, simples|journal = Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure|year = 1909|volume = 26|pages=93–161|url=http://archive.numdam.org/article/ASENS_1909_3_26__93_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not an axiomatic algebraic idea; rather it defines a set of closure conditions on sets of [[homeomorphism]]s defined on [[open set]]s ''U'' of a given [[Euclidean space]] ''E'' or more generally of a fixed [[topological space]] ''S''. The [[groupoid]] condition on those is fulfilled, in that homeomorphisms

:''h'':''U'' &amp;rarr; ''V''

and

:''g'':''V'' &amp;rarr; ''W''

compose to a ''homeomorphism'' from ''U'' to ''W''. The further requirement on a pseudogroup is related to the possibility of ''patching'' (in the sense of [[descent (category theory)|descent]], [[Transition map|transition functions]], or a [[gluing axiom]]).

Specifically, a '''pseudogroup''' on  a topological space ''S'' is a collection ''Γ'' of homeomorphisms between open subsets of ''S'' satisfying the following properties.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, Shoshichi &amp; Nomizu, Katsumi. ''Foundations of Differential Geometry, Volume I''.  Wiley Classics Library. John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York, 1996. Reprint of the 1969 original, A Wiley-Interscience Publication. {{isbn|0-471-15733-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* For every open set ''U'' in ''S'', the identity map on ''U'' is in ''Γ''.
* If ''f'' is in ''Γ'', then so is ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.
* If ''f'' is in ''Γ'', then the restriction of ''f'' to an arbitrary open subset of its domain is in ''Γ''.
* If ''U'' is open in ''S'', ''U'' is the union of the open sets {''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}, ''f'' is a homeomorphism from ''U'' to an open subset of ''S'', and the restriction of ''f'' to ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is in ''Γ'' for all ''i'', then ''f'' is in ''Γ''.
* If ''f'':''U'' → ''V'' and ''f &amp;prime;'':''U &amp;prime;'' → ''V &amp;prime;'' are in ''Γ'', and the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] ''V ∩ U &amp;prime;'' is not empty, then the following restricted composition is in ''Γ'':
:&lt;math&gt;f' \circ f \colon f^{-1}(V \cap U') \to f'(V \cap U')&lt;/math&gt;.

An example in space of two dimensions is the pseudogroup of invertible [[holomorphic function]]s of a [[complex variable]] (invertible in the sense of having an [[inverse function]]). The properties of this pseudogroup are what makes it possible to define [[Riemann surface]]s by local data patched together.

In general, pseudogroups were studied as a possible theory of [[infinite-dimensional Lie group]]s. The concept of a '''local Lie group''', namely a pseudogroup of functions defined in neighbourhoods of the origin of ''E'', is actually closer to Lie's original concept of [[Lie group]], in the case where the transformations involved depend on a finite number of [[parameter]]s, than the contemporary definition via [[manifold]]s. One of Cartan's achievements was to clarify the points involved, including the point that a local Lie group always gives rise to a ''global'' group, in the current sense (an analogue of [[Lie's third theorem]], on [[Lie algebra]]s determining a group). The [[formal group]] is yet another approach to the specification of Lie groups, infinitesimally. It is known, however, that ''local [[topological group]]s'' do not necessarily have global counterparts.

Examples of infinite-dimensional pseudogroups abound, beginning with the pseudogroup of all [[diffeomorphism]]s of ''E''. The interest is mainly in sub-pseudogroups of the diffeomorphisms, and therefore with objects that have a Lie algebra analogue of [[vector field]]s. Methods proposed by Lie and by Cartan for studying these objects have become more practical given the progress of [[computer algebra]].

In the 1950s Cartan's theory was reformulated by [[Shiing-Shen Chern]], and a general [[deformation theory]] for pseudogroups was developed by [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[D. C. Spencer]]. In the 1960s [[homological algebra]] was applied to the basic [[partial differential equation|PDE]] questions involved, of over-determination; this though revealed that the algebra of the theory is potentially very heavy. In the same decade the interest for [[theoretical physics]] of infinite-dimensional Lie theory appeared for the first time, in the shape of [[current algebra]].

'''Reactive inhibition''' is a phrase coined by [[Clark L. Hull]] (1951) in his postulate X.A.:&lt;blockquote&gt;Whenever a reaction ''R'' is evoked from an organism there is left an increment of primary negative drive ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; which inhibits to a degree according to its magnitude the reaction potential&lt;sub&gt; ''S''&lt;/sub&gt;''E''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; to that response (Hull, 1951, p. 74).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Hull's postulate X.B. inhibition ''I'' dissipates exponentially with time ''t'':.:&lt;blockquote&gt;With the passage of time since its formation ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; spontaneously dissipates approximately as a simple decay function of the time ''t'' elapsed, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;I'_R = I_R x 10^{-at}&lt;/math&gt; (Hull, 1951, p. 74).&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hull's decay formula is somewhat awkward and might give rise to confusion. For example, ''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; does not refer to the derivative of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;. A more convenient way of writing the formula would be as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = I(0) e^{-bt}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;b = a \ln (10)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;I(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the inhibition at the beginning the time interval [0,''t'']. Note, that if one takes the natural logarithm of both sides one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(t) = Y(0) - bt&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y(t) = \ln  I(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y(0) = \ln  I(0)&lt;/math&gt;. The last formula is used in [[inhibition theory]].

'''Sexual tension''' is a social phenomenon that occurs when two individuals interact and one or both feel [[sexual desire]], but the [[consummation]] is postponed or never happens. A common scenario is where the two individuals function in close proximity, such as co-workers or in a group of friends, but do not have sex to avoid awkwardness or for other reasons. Sexual tension doesn't have anything to do with the actual act of sex but is everything that leads up to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Palmquist|2012|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual tension can also occur when two individuals have previously had [[human sexual activity|sexual relations]] and still feel an attraction towards each other, but do not wish to have sex again for fear of its effect on their current social situation (such as maintaining a relationship with a different partner). It can also be felt in situations when two individuals have a relationship devoid of physical contact, as in a long-distance relationship.

Sexual tension often occurs between individuals when the relationship is close and often flirtatious, yet the two people involved adamantly deny their feelings for each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://expertdaconquista.com/aprenda-criar-tensao-sexual/|title=Aprenda A Criar Tensão Sexual - Expert da Conquista|date=2016-03-18|language=pt-BR|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, it can appear extremely obvious to other friends or co-workers that such tension is present between the two individuals. When people give in to sexual tension, the relationship can become complicated and awkward if no new relationship level is established, as the relationship that existed before is no longer valid.

== In fiction ==
Sexual tension is a common feature in works of [[fiction]]. This longing is often suggested by incidents of [[intimacy]]; for example, when two characters are alone and in close proximity (or actually touching), yet desire is never explicitly expressed. Another common theme is for characters to develop an interest in each other over the course of the story, and if this is expertly done, the audience can become aware of the growing attraction.

Sexual tension intensifies the audience's involvement with all characters involved. However, as several television series have discovered to their sorrow, tension dissipates when characters come together in sexual harmony. It is not like violence, which establishes the villain's credibility and makes the next round of jeopardy even more powerful. Instead, sexual fulfillment has the same effect on sexual tension that the death of the victim has on jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Card|2010|pp=93–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Network Science}}
A '''social network ''' is a [[social structure]] made up of a set of [[social]] actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] ties, and other [[Social relation|social interaction]]s between actors. The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures.&lt;ref name="WF94CH1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wasserman |first1=Stanley | author-link1= Stanley Wasserman|last2=Faust |first2=Katherine |year=1994 |title=Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications |isbn=9780521387071 |chapter=Social Network Analysis in the Social and Behavioral Sciences |pages=1–27 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of these structures uses [[social network analysis]] to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.

Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field which emerged from [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], [[statistics]], and [[graph theory]]. [[Georg Simmel]] authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and "web of group affiliations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott |first1=W.

Together with other [[complex network]]s, it forms part of the nascent field of [[network science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science |year=2009 |volume=323 |number=5916 |pages=892–895 |doi=10.1126/science.1165821 |pmid=19213908 |title=Network Analysis in the Social Sciences |first1=Stephen P. |last1=Borgatti |first2=Ajay |last2=Mehra |first3=Daniel J. |last3=Brass |first4=Giuseppe |last4=Labianca|bibcode=2009Sci...323..892B |citeseerx=10.1.1.536.5568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EK"&gt;{{cite book|title=Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World |first1=David |last1=Easley |first2=Jon |last2=Kleinberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |chapter=Overview |pages=1–20 |isbn=978-0-521-19533-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Barabasi Albert model.gif|thumb|left|Evolution graph of a social network: [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási model]].]]

The social network is a [[Scientific theory|theoretical]] [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] useful in the [[social sciences]] to study relationships between individuals, [[social groups|groups]], [[formal organizations|organizations]], or even entire [[society|societies]] ([[social unit]]s, see [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]]). The term is used to describe a [[social structure]] determined by such [[social interactions|interactions]]. The ties through which any given social unit connects represent the convergence of the various social contacts of that unit. This theoretical approach is, necessarily, relational.  An [[axiom]] of the social network approach to understanding [[social interaction]] is that social phenomena should be primarily conceived and investigated through the properties of relations between and within units, instead of the properties of these units themselves. Thus, one common criticism of social network theory is that [[Agency (sociology)|individual agency]] is often ignored&lt;ref name="jscott"&gt;Scott, John P. (2000). ''Social Network Analysis: A Handbook'' (2nd edition). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; although this may not be the case in practice (see [[agent-based model]]ing). Precisely because many different types of relations, singular or in combination, form these network configurations, [[Network science|network analytics]] are useful to a broad range of research enterprises. In social science, these fields of study include, but are not limited to [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[information science]], [[organizational studies]], [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[sociolinguistics]].

==History==
In the late 1890s, both [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] foreshadowed the idea of social networks in their theories and research of [[social group]]s. Tönnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (''[[Gemeinschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[community]]") or impersonal, formal, and instrumental social links (''[[Gesellschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[society]]").&lt;ref&gt;Tönnies, Ferdinand (1887).

Major developments in the field can be seen in the 1930s by several groups in psychology, anthropology, and mathematics working independently.&lt;ref name=jscott /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a historical overview of the development of social network analysis, see: {{cite book|authors=Carrington, Peter J. &amp; Scott, John|chapter=Introduction|title=The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis| publisher=Sage|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84787-395-8|page=1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2chSmLzClXgC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the diagram in {{cite book|author=Scott, John|title=Social Network Analysis: A Handbook|publisher=Sage|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7619-6339-4|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww3_bKcz6kgC&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], in the 1930s, [[Jacob L. Moreno]] began systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups, especially classrooms and work groups (see [[sociometry]]). In [[anthropology]], the foundation for social network theory is the theoretical and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] work of [[Bronislaw Malinowski]],&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronislaw (1913).

''The Social System''. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, drawing upon Parsons' theory, the work of sociologist [[Peter Blau]] provides a strong impetus for analyzing the relational ties of social units with his work on [[social exchange theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1956). ''Bureaucracy in Modern Society''. New York: Random House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1960). "A Theory of Social Integration".

By the 1970s, a growing number of scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions. One group consisted of sociologist [[Harrison White]] and his students at the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Harvard University Department of Social Relations]]. Also independently active in the Harvard Social Relations department at the time were [[Charles Tilly]], who focused on networks in political and community sociology and social movements, and [[Stanley Milgram]], who developed the "six degrees of separation" thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semioticon.com/semiotix/semiotix14/sem-14-05.html |title=The Networked Individual: A Profile of Barry Wellman |author=Bernie Hogan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Granovetter]]&lt;ref name="Introduction for the French Reader"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granovetter | first1 = Mark | year = 2007 | title = Introduction for the French Reader | url = | journal = Sociologica | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barry Wellman]]&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry (1988).

Beginning in the late 1990s, social network analysis experienced work by sociologists, political scientists, and physicists such as [[Duncan J. Watts]], [[Albert-László Barabási]], [[Peter Bearman]], [[Nicholas A. Christakis]], [[James H. Fowler]], and others, developing and applying new models and methods to emerging data available about online social networks, as well as "digital traces" regarding face-to-face networks.

==Levels of analysis==
[[File:Network self-organization stages.png|thumb|right|Self-organization of a network, based on Nagler, Levina, &amp; Timme, (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nagler, Jan, Anna Levina and Marc Timme|year=2011|title=Impact of single links in competitive percolation|journal=Nature Physics|volume=7|issue=3|pages=265–270|doi=10.1038/nphys1860|arxiv=1103.0922|bibcode=2011NatPh...7..265N}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Social Network Diagram (large).svg|right|thumb|Centrality]]
In general, social networks are [[self-organization|self-organizing]], [[emergence|emergent]], and [[social complexity|complex]], such that a globally coherent pattern appears from the local interaction of the elements that make up the system.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Mark, Albert-László Barabási and Duncan J. Watts (2006). ''The Structure and Dynamics of Networks'' (Princeton Studies in Complexity). Oxford: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = Barry | year = 2008 | title = Review: The development of social network analysis: A study in the sociology of science | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 221–222 | doi=10.1177/009430610803700308}}&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns become more apparent as network size increases. However, a global network analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faust|first=Stanley Wasserman; Katherine|title=Social network analysis : methods and applications|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521382694|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of, for example, all [[interpersonal relationships]] in the world is not feasible and is likely to contain so much [[Information theory|information]] as to be uninformative. Practical limitations of computing power, ethics and participant recruitment and payment also limit the scope of a social network analysis.&lt;ref name="Kadu12"&gt;Kadushin, C. (2012). ''Understanding social networks: Theories, concepts, and findings''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Granovetter, M.|title= Network sampling: Some first steps| year=1976 |pages=1287–1303 |volume=81| issue=6 |journal= American Journal of Sociology | doi=10.1086/226224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuances of a local system may be lost in a large network analysis, hence the quality of information may be more important than its scale for understanding network properties. Thus, social networks are analyzed at the scale relevant to the researcher's theoretical question. Although [[level of analysis|levels of analysis]] are not necessarily [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]], there are three general levels into which networks may fall: [[Microsociology|micro-level]], [[wikt:meso-|meso-level]], and [[Macrosociology|macro-level]].

===Micro level===
At the micro-level, social network research typically begins with an individual, [[Snowball sampling|snowballing]] as social relationships are traced, or may begin with a small group of individuals in a particular social context.

'''Dyadic level''': A [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] is a social relationship between two individuals. Network research on dyads may concentrate on [[Structural functionalism|structure]] of the relationship (e.g. multiplexity, strength), [[social equality]], and tendencies toward [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity/mutuality]].

'''Triadic level''': Add one individual to a dyad, and you have a [[Triadic relation|triad]]. Research at this level may concentrate on factors such as [[Independence number|balance]] and [[Vertex-transitive graph|transitivity]], as well as [[social equality]] and tendencies toward [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity/mutuality]].&lt;ref name="Kadu12"/&gt; In the [[balance theory]] of [[Fritz Heider]] the triad is the key to social dynamics. The discord in a rivalrous [[love triangle]] is an example of an unbalanced triad, likely to change to a balanced triad by a change in one of the relations. The dynamics of social friendships in society has been modeled by balancing triads. The study is carried forward with the theory of [[signed graph]]s.

'''Actor level''': The smallest unit of analysis in a social network is an individual in their social setting, i.e., an "actor" or "ego". Egonetwork analysis focuses on network characteristics such as size, relationship strength, density, [[centrality]], [[wikt:prestige|prestige]] and roles such as [[isolates|isolates, liaisons]], and [[Bridge (interpersonal)|bridges]].&lt;ref name="Jone11"/&gt; Such analyses, are most commonly used in the fields of [[psychology]] or [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], [[ethnographic]] [[kinship]] analysis or other [[genealogy|genealogical]] studies of relationships between individuals.

'''Subset level''': [[Subset]] levels of network research problems begin at the micro-level, but may cross over into the meso-level of analysis. Subset level research may focus on [[Distance (graph theory)|distance]] and reachability, [[cliques]], [[Cohesion (social policy)|cohesive]] subgroups, or other [[Group action (sociology)|group actions]] or [[Group behaviour|behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title="Graph Theoretical Approaches to Social Network Analysis". in Computational Complexity: Theory, Techniques, and Applications (Robert A. Meyers, ed.) | publisher=Springer | author=de Nooy, Wouter |year=2012 | pages=2864–2877 | isbn=978-1-4614-1800-9|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-1800-9_176| chapter=Social Network Analysis, Graph Theoretical Approaches to }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meso level===
In general, meso-level theories begin with a [[Sample population|population]] size that falls between the micro- and macro-levels. However, meso-level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro- and macro-levels. Meso-level networks are low density and may exhibit causal processes distinct from interpersonal micro-level networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedström | first1 = Peter | last2 = Sandell | first2 = Rickard | last3 = Stern | first3 = Charlotta | year = 2000 | title = Mesolevel Networks and the Diffusion of Social Movements: The Case of the Swedish Social Democratic Party | url = http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/hedstrom/ajs3.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 106 | issue = 1| pages = 145–172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Social Red.jpg|thumb|right|Social network diagram, meso-level]]

'''Organizations''': Formal [[organizations]] are [[social group]]s that distribute tasks for a collective [[goal]].&lt;ref name="Riketta, M. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riketta | first1 = M. | last2 = Nienber | first2 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Multiple identities and work motivation: The role of perceived compatibility between nested organizational units | url = | journal = British Journal of Management | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = S61–77 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8551.2007.00526.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network research on organizations may focus on either intra-organizational or inter-organizational ties in terms of [[Formal organization|formal]] or [[Informal organization|informal]] relationships. Intra-organizational networks themselves often contain multiple levels of analysis, especially in larger organizations with multiple branches, franchises or semi-autonomous departments. In these cases, research is often conducted at a workgroup level and organization level, focusing on the interplay between the two structures.&lt;ref name="Riketta, M. 2007"/&gt;  Experiments with networked groups online have documented ways to optimize group-level coordination through diverse interventions, including the addition of autonomous agents to the groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shirado|first=Hirokazu|last2=Christakis|first2=Nicholas A|title=Locally noisy autonomous agents improve global human coordination in network experiments|journal=Nature|volume=545|issue=7654|pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/nature22332|pmid=28516927|pmc=5912653|bibcode=2017Natur.545..370S|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randomly distributed networks''': [[Exponential random graph models]] of social networks became state-of-the-art methods of social network analysis in the 1980s. This framework has the capacity to represent social-structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks, including general [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]]-based structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks as well as [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] and [[Transitive set|transitivity]], and at the node-level, [[homophily]] and [[Attribute-value system|attribute]]-based activity and popularity effects, as derived from explicit hypotheses about [[Dependency graph|dependencies]] among network ties. [[Parameter]]s are given in terms of the prevalence of small [[Induced subgraph|subgraph]] configurations in the network and can be interpreted as describing the combinations of local social processes from which a given network emerges. These probability models for networks on a given set of actors allow generalization beyond the restrictive dyadic independence assumption of micro-networks, allowing models to be built from theoretical structural foundations of social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cranmer | first1 = Skyler J. | last2 = Desmarais | first2 = Bruce A. | year = 2011 | title = Inferential Network Analysis with Exponential Random Graph Models | url = | journal = Political Analysis | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 66–86 | doi=10.1093/pan/mpq037| citeseerx = 10.1.1.623.751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scale-free network sample.png|thumb|right|Examples of a random network and a scale-free network. Each graph has 32 nodes and 32 links. Note the "hubs" (shaded) in the scale-free diagram (on the right).]]

'''Scale-free networks''': A [[scale-free network]] is a [[complex network|network]] whose [[degree distribution]] follows a [[power law]], at least [[asymptotic]]ally. In [[network theory]] a scale-free ideal network is a [[random network]] with a [[degree distribution]] that unravels the size distribution of social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moreira, André A., Demétrius R. Paula, Raimundo N. Costa Filho, José S. Andrade, Jr. |title=Competitive cluster growth in complex networks |year=2006 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.73.065101 |pmid=16906890 |journal=Physical Review E |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=065101 |arxiv=cond-mat/0603272 |bibcode=2006PhRvE..73f5101M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific characteristics of scale-free networks vary with the theories and analytical tools used to create them, however, in general, scale-free networks have some common characteristics. One notable characteristic in a scale-free network is the relative commonness of [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] with a [[Maximum degree|degree]] that greatly exceeds the average. The highest-degree nodes are often called "hubs", and may serve specific purposes in their networks, although this depends greatly on the social context. Another general characteristic of scale-free networks is the [[clustering coefficient]] distribution, which decreases as the node degree increases. This distribution also follows a [[power law]].&lt;ref&gt;Barabási, Albert-László (2003). ''Linked: how everything is connected to everything else and what it means for business, science, and everyday life''. New York: Plum.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási]] model of network evolution shown above is an example of a scale-free network.

===Macro level===
Rather than tracing interpersonal interactions, macro-level analyses generally trace the outcomes of interactions, such as [[economic]] or other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfer]] interactions over a large [[Sample population|population]].

[[File:Diagram of a social network.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram: section of a large-scale social network]]

'''Large-scale networks''': [[Large-scale macroeconometric model|Large-scale network]] is a term somewhat synonymous with "macro-level" as used, primarily, in [[social science|social]] and [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] sciences, in [[economics]]. Originally, the term was used extensively in the [[computer sciences]] (see [[Network mapping#Large-scale mapping project|large-scale network mapping]]).

'''Complex networks''': Most larger social networks display features of [[social complexity]], which involves substantial non-trivial features of [[network topology]], with patterns of complex connections between elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random (see, [[complexity science]], [[dynamical system]] and [[chaos theory]]), as do [[biological]], and [[Computer network|technological networks]]. Such [[complex network]] features include a heavy tail in the [[degree distribution]], a high [[clustering coefficient]], [[assortativity]] or disassortativity among vertices, [[community structure]] (see [[stochastic block model]]), and [[hierarchy|hierarchical structure]]. In the case of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency-directed]] networks these features also include [[Reciprocity in network|reciprocity]], triad significance profile (TSP, see [[network motif]]), and other features. In contrast, many of the mathematical models of networks that have been studied in the past, such as [[lattice graph|lattices]] and [[random graph]]s, do not show these features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strogatz, Steven H.|year=2001|title=Exploring complex networks|journal=Nature|volume=410|pages=268–276|doi=10.1038/35065725|pmid=11258382|issue=6825|bibcode=2001Natur.410..268S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical links==

===Imported theories===
Various theoretical frameworks have been imported for the use of social network analysis. The most prominent of these are [[Graph theory]], [[Balance theory]], [[Social comparison theory]], and more recently, the [[Social identity approach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Kilduff, M., Tsai, W. |year=2003 |title= Social networks and organisations |publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous theories===
Few complete theories have been produced from social network analysis. Two that have are [[role theory|Structural Role Theory]] and Heterophily Theory.

The basis of Heterophily Theory was the finding in one study that more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation, as cliques have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as well as share many common traits. This homophilic tendency was the reason for the members of the cliques to be attracted together in the first place. However, being similar, each member of the clique would also know more or less what the other members knew. To find new information or insights, members of the clique will have to look beyond the clique to its other friends and acquaintances. This is what Granovetter called "the strength of weak ties".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Granovetter, M. |year=1973 |title= The strength of weak ties |journal= American Journal of Sociology |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages= 1360–1380 |doi=10.1086/225469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural holes==
In the context of networks, [[social capital]] exists where people have an advantage because of their location in a network. Contacts in a network provide information, opportunities and perspectives that can be beneficial to the central player in the network. Most social structures tend to be characterized by dense clusters of strong connections.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burt|first=Ronald|title=Structural Holes and Good Ideas|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=2004|doi=10.1086/421787|volume=110|issue=2|pages=349–399|citeseerx=10.1.1.388.2251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information within these clusters tends to be rather homogeneous and redundant. Non-redundant information is most often obtained through contacts in different clusters.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burt|first=Ronald|title=Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When two separate clusters possess non-redundant information, there is said to be a structural hole between them.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt; Thus, a network that bridges [[structural holes]] will provide network benefits that are in some degree additive, rather than overlapping. An ideal network structure has a vine and cluster structure, providing access to many different clusters and structural holes.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt;

Networks rich in structural holes are a form of social capital in that they offer [[Information theory|information]] benefits. The main player in a network that bridges structural holes is able to access information from diverse sources and clusters.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt; For example, in [[Business networking|business network]]s, this is beneficial to an individual's career because he is more likely to hear of job openings and opportunities if his network spans a wide range of contacts in different industries/sectors. This concept is similar to Mark Granovetter's theory of [[Interpersonal ties|weak ties]], which rests on the basis that having a broad range of contacts is most effective for job attainment.

==Research clusters==

===Communication===
[[Communication Studies]] are often considered a part of both the social sciences and the humanities, drawing heavily on fields such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[information science]], [[biology]], [[political science]], and [[economics]] as well as [[rhetoric]], [[literary studies]], and [[semiotics]]. Many communication concepts describe the transfer of information from one source to another, and can thus be conceived of in terms of a network.

===Community===
In J.A. Barnes' day, a "[[community]]" referred to a specific geographic location and studies of community ties had to do with who talked, associated, traded, and attended church with whom. Today, however, there are extended "online" communities developed through [[telecommunications]] devices and [[social network services]]. Such devices and services require extensive and ongoing maintenance and analysis, often using [[network science]] methods. [[Community development]] studies, today, also make extensive use of such methods.

===Complex networks===
[[Complex networks]] require methods specific to modelling and interpreting [[social complexity]] and [[complex adaptive system]]s, including techniques of [[dynamic network analysis]].
Mechanisms such as [[Dual-phase evolution#social networks|Dual-phase evolution]] explain how temporal changes in connectivity contribute to the formation of structure in social networks.

===Criminal networks===
In [[criminology]] and [[urban sociology]], much attention has been paid to the social networks among criminal actors. For example, Andrew Papachristos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papachristos |first=Andrew |year=2009 |title=Murder by Structure: Dominance Relations and the Social Structure of Gang Homicide |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=74–128 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.855304 |url=http://www.papachristos.org/Publications_2_files/ajs_final_version.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407094725/http://www.papachristos.org/Publications_2_files/ajs_final_version.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has studied gang murders as a series of exchanges between gangs. Murders can be seen to diffuse outwards from a single source, because weaker gangs cannot afford to kill members of stronger gangs in retaliation, but must commit other violent acts to maintain their reputation for strength.

===Diffusion of innovations===
[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of ideas and innovations]] studies focus on the spread and use of ideas from one actor to another or one [[culture]] and another. This line of research seeks to explain why some become "early adopters" of ideas and innovations, and links social network structure with facilitating or impeding the spread of an innovation.

===Demography===
In [[demography]], the study of social networks has led to new sampling methods for estimating and reaching populations that are hard to enumerate (for example, homeless people or intravenous drug users.) For example, respondent driven sampling is a network-based sampling technique that relies on respondents to a survey recommending further respondents.

===Economic sociology===
The field of [[sociology]] focuses almost entirely on networks of outcomes of social interactions. More narrowly, [[economic sociology]] considers behavioral interactions of individuals and groups through [[social capital]] and social "markets". Sociologists, such as Mark Granovetter, have developed core principles about the interactions of social structure, information, ability to punish or reward, and trust that frequently recur in their analyses of political, economic and other institutions. Granovetter examines how social structures and social networks can affect economic outcomes like hiring, price, productivity and innovation and describes sociologists' contributions to analyzing the impact of social structure and networks on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, Mark (2005). "The Impact of Social Structure on Economic Outcomes". ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4134991 19(1): 33–50]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Analysis of social networks is increasingly incorporated into [[health care analytics]], not only in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies but also in models of [[Health Communication|patient communication]] and education, disease prevention, mental health diagnosis and treatment, and in the study of health care organizations and [[health care systems|systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Judith and Bernice Pescosolido (2002). ''Social Networks and Health''. Boston, MA: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human ecology===
[[Human ecology]] is an [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] study of the relationship between [[human]]s and their [[natural environment|natural]], [[Social environment|social]], and [[built environment]]s. The scientific philosophy of human ecology has a diffuse history with connections to [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[zoology]], and natural [[ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Crona, Beatrice and Klaus Hubacek (eds.)

===Language and linguistics===
Studies of [[language]] and [[linguistics]], particularly [[evolutionary linguistics]], focus on the development of [[Morphology (linguistics)|linguistic forms]] and transfer of changes, [[Phonology|sounds]] or words, from one language system to another through networks of social interaction. Social networks are also important in [[language shift]], as groups of people add and/or abandon languages to their repertoire.

===Literary networks===
In the study of literary systems, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anheier | first1 = H. K. | last2 = Romo | first2 = F. P. | year = 1995 | title = Forms of capital and social structure of fields: examining Bourdieu's social topography | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 859–903 | doi=10.1086/230603}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Nooy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Nooy | first1 = W | year = | title = Fields and networks: Correspondence analysis and social network analysis in the framework of Field Theory | url = | journal = Poetics | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 305–327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Senekal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Senekal | first1 = B. A. | year = 2012 | title = Die Afrikaanse literêre sisteem: ŉ Eksperimentele benadering met behulp van Sosiale-netwerk-analise (SNA) | url = | journal = LitNet Akademies | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to study various aspects of how literature functions. The basic premise is that polysystem theory, which has been around since the writings of [[Even-Zohar]], can be integrated with network theory and the relationships between different actors in the literary network, e.g. writers, critics, publishers, literary histories, etc., can be mapped using [[Computer graphics (computer science)|visualization]] from SNA.

===Organizational studies===
Research studies of [[Formal organization|formal]] or [[informal organization]] [[Social relation|relationships]], [[organizational communication]], [[economics]], [[economic sociology]], and other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfers]]. Social networks have also been used to examine how organizations interact with each other, characterizing the many [[Interlocking directorate|informal connections]] that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Podolny | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Baron | first2 = J.

===Social capital===
[[Social capital]] is a form of [[Capital (economics)|economic]] and [[cultural capital]] in which social networks are central, [[Stock and flow|transactions]] are marked by [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and [[cooperation]], and [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Agent (economics)|agents]] produce [[goods and services]] not mainly for themselves, but for a [[common good]].

Social capital is a sociological concept about the value of [[social relation]]s and the role of cooperation and confidence to achieve positive outcomes. The term refers to the value one can get from their social ties. For example, newly arrived immigrants can make use of their social ties to established migrants to acquire jobs they may otherwise have trouble getting (e.g., because of unfamiliarity with the local language). A positive relationship exists between social capital and the intensity of social network use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebastián|first=Valenzuela|author2=Namsu Park |author3=Kerk F. Kee |title=Is There Social Capital in a Social Network Site? Facebook Use and College Students' Life Satisfaction, Trust, and Participation|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2009|volume=14|issue=4|pages=875–901|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01474.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Social Connectivity in America: Changes in Adult Friendship Network Size from 2002 to 2007 |author1=Wang, Hua  |author2=Barry Wellman  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=American Behavioral Scientist | year=2010 | volume=53 | issue=8 | pages=1148–1169 | doi=10.1177/0002764209356247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a dynamic framework, higher activity in a network feeds into higher social capital which itself encourages more activity.&lt;ref name="GaudeulGiannetti2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaudeul|first1=Alexia|last2=Giannetti|first2=Caterina|title=The role of reciprocation in social network formation, with an application to LiveJournal|journal=Social Networks|volume=35|issue=3|year=2013|pages=317–330|issn=03788733|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2013.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network position and benefits===
In many [[Formal organizations|organizations]], members tend to focus their activities inside their own groups, which stifles creativity and restricts opportunities. A player whose network bridges structural holes has an advantage in detecting and developing rewarding opportunities.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"/&gt; Such a player can mobilize social capital by acting as a "broker" of information between two clusters that otherwise would not have been in contact, thus providing access to new ideas, opinions and opportunities. British philosopher and political economist [[John Stuart Mill]], writes, "it is hardly possible to overrate the value ... of placing human beings in contact with persons dissimilar to themselves.... Such communication [is] one of the primary sources of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mill|first=John|title=Principles of Political Economy|year=1909|publisher=William J Ashley|location=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a player with a network rich in structural holes can add value to an organization through new ideas and opportunities. This in turn, helps an individual's career development and advancement.

A social capital broker also reaps control benefits of being the facilitator of information flow between contacts. In the case of consulting firm Eden McCallum, the founders were able to advance their careers by bridging their connections with former big three consulting firm consultants and mid-size industry firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Heidi|author2=Eccles, Robert |title=Eden McCallum: A Network Based Consulting Firm|journal=Harvard Business School Review|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By bridging structural holes and mobilizing social capital, players can advance their careers by executing new opportunities between contacts.

There has been research that both substantiates and refutes the benefits of information brokerage. A study of high tech Chinese firms by Zhixing Xiao found that the control benefits of structural holes are "dissonant to the dominant firm-wide spirit of cooperation and the information benefits cannot materialize due to the communal sharing values" of such organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao, Zhixing; Tsui, Anne (2007). "When Brokers May Not Work: The Cultural Contingency of [http://iniciarsesionentrar.com/facebook/ Social] Capital in Chinese High-tech Firms". ''Administrative Science Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study only analyzed Chinese firms, which tend to have strong communal sharing values. Information and control benefits of structural holes are still valuable in firms that are not quite as inclusive and cooperative on the firm-wide level. In 2004, Ronald Burt studied 673 managers who ran the supply chain for one of America's largest electronics companies. He found that managers who often discussed issues with other groups were better paid, received more positive job evaluations and were more likely to be promoted.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"/&gt; Thus, bridging structural holes can be beneficial to an organization, and in turn, to an individual's career.

===Social media===
{{main article|Social media}}
[[Computer network]]s combined with social networking software produces a new medium for social interaction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The International Encyclopedia of Media Effects|last=Amichai-Hamburger|first=Yair|last2=Hayat|first2=Tsahi|date=2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118783764|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118783764.wbieme0170}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A relationship over a computerized [[social networking service]] can be characterized by context, direction, and strength. The content of a relation refers to the resource that is exchanged. In a [[computer mediated communication]] context, social pairs exchange different kinds of information, including sending a data file or a computer program as well as providing emotional support or arranging a meeting. With the rise of [[electronic commerce]], information exchanged may also correspond to exchanges of money, goods or services in the "real" world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Studying Online Social Networks | author=Garton, Laura, [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]], and [[Barry Wellman]] | journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |date=23 June 2006 | volume=3 | issue=1 |pages = 0| doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00062.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social network analysis]] methods have become essential to examining these types of computer mediated communication.

In addition, the sheer size and the volatile nature of [[social media]] has given rise to new network metrics. A key concern with networks extracted from social media is the lack of robustness of network metrics given missing data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = Wei | last2 = Joseph | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Liu | first3 = Huan | last4 = Carley | first4 = Kathleen M. | year = 2016 | title = Exploring Characteristics of Suspended Users and Network Stability on Twitter | url = | journal = Social Network Analysis and Mining | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Somerville College''' is one of the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|constituent colleges]] of the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]]. The college has an excellent reputation and an outstanding student satisfaction among the Oxford colleges.&lt;ref name=satisfaction /&gt; Founded in 1879 as '''Somerville Hall''', it was one of the first two [[women's college]]s in Oxford, and [[list of Somerville College, Oxford people|its alumni]], such as [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Indira Gandhi]], [[Dorothy Hodgkin]], [[Iris Murdoch]], [[Vera Brittain]], [[Cornelia Sorabji]], [[Dorothy L.

==History==
===Founding===
In June 1878, the ''Association for the Higher Education of Women'' was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were [[George Granville Bradley]], Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[T. H. Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the "[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=374}}

Thus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college "in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations."{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=374}}}}{{sfn|Batson|2008|pp=22-3}} This committee was called the "[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=21}}{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=11}} This second committee included [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], [[George William Kitchin]], [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A. H. D. Acland]], [[Thomas Hill Green]], [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mary Ward]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/somerville-stories/mary-ward/|title=Mary Ward|access-date=26 August 2018|publisher=Somerville College, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Sidgwick, [[Henry Nettleship]], [[Walter Pater]] and [[Augustus George Vernon Harcourt|A. G. Vernon Harcourt]].{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=11}}

This new effort resulted in the founding of ''Somerville Hall'', named for the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer [[Mary Somerville]].{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=374}} It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody.{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=23}} She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.

[[Madeleine Shaw Lefevre]] was chosen as the first Principal because, although not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance.{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=24}} Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as "an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution."{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=25}}

===Women's college===
When opened, Somerville Hall had twelve students, ranging in age between 17 and 36.{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=26}} The first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop on [[Little Clarendon Street]].&lt;ref name="Lannon"&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Lannon|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/404111.article|title=Her Oxford|publisher=''Times Higher Education''|date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two of the original 12 students admitted in 1879 remained in Oxford for three years, the period for which male students had to remain to complete a [[bachelor's degree]].{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=28}}

Increasingly, however, as the college admitted more students, it became more formalized. Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of 'college' (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the '[[bluestocking]] college', its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=9}}

In the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=xv}}{{sfn|Adams|1996|pp=150-1}} All female students had to be [[Chaperone (social)|chaperoned]] when in the presence of male students from the college's inception. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a [[curfew]].{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=215}} In 1925, during the principalship of [[Janet Vaughan]], Somerville's college charter was granted.

===World War One===
During [[World War I]] the college was converted into a military hospital as Somerville Section of the 3rd Southern General Hospital, adjacent to the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/|title=Somerville Hospital – Then and Now|access-date=27 August 2018|publisher=Somerville College}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from the Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].

Notable patients who stayed in Somerville include [[Robert Graves]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital. ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''. At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie. About his time at Somerville, he wrote: ''I enjoyed my stay at Somerville. The sun shone, and the discipline was easy''. Officer [[Llewelyn Davies (RFC officer)|Llewelyn Davies]] died at the college. Photographs of the college in this period can be found hanging in Hall, outside the pantry.

Once the war ended, the return to normality between Oriel College and Somerville College was delayed, sparking both frustration and an incident in spring 1919 known as the 'Oriel raid', in which male students made a hole in the wall dividing the sexes. In July 1919 the Principal ([[Emily Penrose]]) and Fellows returned to Somerville.

Alumna [[Vera Brittain]] wrote about the impact of the war in Oxford and paid tribute to the work of the Principal, Miss Penrose, in her memoir ''[[Testament of Youth]]''.

===Admission of men===
Starting in the 1970s, the traditionally all-male colleges in Oxford began to admit female students.{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=572}} Since it was assumed that recruiting from a wider demographic would guarantee better students, there was pressure on single-sex colleges to change their policy to avoid falling down the rankings.{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|pp=577-8}} All-female colleges, like Somerville, found it increasingly difficult to attract good applicants and fell to the bottom of the intercollegiate academic rankings during the period.{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=613}}

During the 1980s, there was much debate as to whether women's colleges should become mixed. Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/199/all/1/History.aspx|title=History of Somerville College, Oxford|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218061223/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/199/all/1/History.aspx|archivedate=18 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html|title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year|first=Stephen|last=Pritchard|date=18 November 1993|publisher=''[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somerville became the second-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn|Brockliss|2016|p=573}} With an intake 50% male/female; a gender balance maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.

==Buildings and grounds==
The college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located on [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]]. The front of the college runs between the [[Oxford Oratory]] and the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]]. Somerville has buildings of various architectural styles, many of which bear the names of former principals of the college, located around one of Oxford's biggest [[quadrangle (architecture)|quads]]. Five buildings are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed.

A 2017 [[archaeology|archaeological]] evaluation of the site shows that in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of a [[17th century]] building and earthworks beneath Somerville's site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]]. There are also remains of some [[19th century]] buildings, including a stone-lined well.&lt;ref name=hughes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/the-catherine-hughes-building/|title=The Catherine Hughes Building|access-date=30 August 2018|website=www.some.ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walton House===
[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House from the Quad]]
The original building of Somerville Hall, Walton House (commonly called 'House') was built in 1826 and purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] in 1880 amid fears that the men's colleges might, in the future, repossess the site for their own purposes.{{sfn|Batson|2008|p=26}} The house could only accommodate 7 of the 12 students who came up to Oxford in the first year.&lt;ref name="british-history.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63899#n43|title=Somerville College – British History Online|website=british-history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, Sir [[Thomas Graham Jackson]] was commissioned to build a new south wing which could accommodate eleven more students. In 1892, [[Walter Cave]] added a north wing and an extra storey. He also installed a gatehouse at the Woodstock Road entrance. In 1897/98, the 'Eleanor Smith cottages' were built, adjoining Walton House.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=11}}

Today House is home to some students. It also contains Green Hall, where guests to College are often greeted and in which prospective students are registered and wait for interviews. Until 2014, it housed the college bar. Most of the administration of college and academic [[pigeon-hole messagebox]]es are located in House. A staircase from Green Hall leads up to Hall. Somerville's dining hall has a curved ceiling and wooden panelling and is one of very few in Oxford to contain portraits only of women.

===Park===
[[File:Somerville College Oxford, Park.jpg|thumb|right|Park Building]]
Originally known as West, due to its location within the college, the project to build a second self-contained hall was an attempt to imitate [[Newnham College, Cambridge]]. The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885-7 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and Vice-Principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=12}} The second building stage (1888-1895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).&lt;ref name="british-history.ac.uk"/&gt; It was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the Principal from 1980 to 1989.

There are over 60 student rooms and Fellows' rooms within the building. There is a music room and computer room. Park is a [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1369711|title=SOMERVILLE COLLEGE, WEST BUILDING|access-date=16 September 2018|website=[[Historic England]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library===
{{Main|Somerville College Library}}
[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - Library1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Somerville College Library]]]]
Designed by [[Basil Champneys]] in 1903 and opened by [[John Morley]] the following year, Somerville College Library was the first purpose-built library amongst the women's colleges of the university. Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. As such it was designed to serve readers beyond the membership of the college and to contain 60,000 volumes despite the college only possessing 6000 in 1903. The [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed building now contains around 120,000 items and is the second largest college library in the university.

[[Amelia Edwards]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[Vera Brittain]] are notable benefactors to the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108093838/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The John Stuart Mill room contains what was Mill's personal library in London at the time of his death, with significant annotations in many of the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/library-it/special-collections/john-stuart-mill-collection/|title=John Stuart Mill Collection – Somerville College Oxford|publisher=University of Oxford|access-date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library dominates the north wing of the main quadrangle and is open 24 hours, with wifi access which is college-wide, a group study room, and many computers. It has with 100% the highest library satisfaction according to the annual student surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/library-it/|website=some.ox.ac.uk|title=Library &amp;#038; IT &amp;mdash; Somerville College Oxford |accessdate=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hall and Maitland===
[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - Main quad, summer.JPG|thumb|right|View of Hall and Maitland (right) from the quad]]
[[File:Somerville College Oxford, Hall from High Table.jpg|thumb|right|Hall]]
Until 1911, there was no hall large enough to seat the entire college. The buildings were designed by [[Edmund Fisher]] in [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] and [[Edwardian Baroque architecture]]. Maitland Hall and Maitland were opened by [[H. A. L. Fisher]], the Vice-Chancellor of the University and [[Gilbert Murray]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=22}} Murray, whose translations of Greek drama were performed at Somerville in 1912 and 1946, supported Somerville in many ways, including endowing its first research fellowship. A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906. This money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J. Forester in 1897 and bought from [[University College, Oxford|University]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]]s for £4000 and £1,400.&lt;ref name="british-history.ac.uk"/&gt; There was difficulty in the construction of the buildings, which is now thought to have been the result of the outer limit of the Oxford city fortifications running under the site. In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House. In 1947, [[André Gide]] gave a lecture in the hall.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=22}}

Hall and Maitland form the East face of the main quad and are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101369712-somerville-college-hall-and-maltland-block-oxford|title=Somerville College, Hall and Maltland Block|website=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|access-date=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senior Common Room is situated on the ground floor. The first floor is occupied by the pantry and the hall, in which Formal Hall (called guest night) is held weekly during term time.

Maitland houses few students, being mainly occupied by Fellows' offices and the college IT office. The building is named after Principal Agnes Maitland, and is to the south of Hall.&lt;ref name="blogs.some.ox.ac.uk"/&gt;

===Penrose===
The Penrose block was designed by Harold Rogers in 1925 and its first students were installed in 1927. It is situated at the south western end of the main quadrangle on the site of 119 and 119A [[Walton Street, Oxford|Walton Street]].&lt;ref name="british-history.ac.uk"/&gt; A row of [[Populus|poplar]]s had to be removed in 1926 for the construction of Penrose.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=35}}

The building was refurbished in 2014, with carpets replacing the formerly bare wooden floorboards, and new furniture. Penrose is named for Dame [[Emily Penrose]], the third principal of the college. Penrose houses mainly first year accommodation, with around 30 rooms.&lt;ref name="blogs.some.ox.ac.uk"/&gt; Some fellows' rooms are located in Penrose.

===Darbishire===
[[File:Somerville College Darbishire quad 2.png|thumb|right|Darbishire Quad]]
Darbishire Quad was the culmination of a long-standing project to absorb Woodstock Road properties above the [[Oxford Oratory]]. In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of £1,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining 'Waggon and Horses' was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.

[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures with a loan of £12,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and a council room, the New Council Room, were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduate and fellows' rooms.&lt;ref name="british-history.ac.uk"/&gt; The coat of arms of Somerville and that of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by Edmund Ware inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.

Originally it was called the East Quadrangle and it was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it 'a notable addition to buildings of varying styles' (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=26}}

Today Darbishire contains around 50 student rooms mixed with tutors' offices, the college archive and medical room.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[José María Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville, from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaloceancommission.org/about-the-commission/contact/|title=contact – Somerville College Oxford|website=''globaloceancommission.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] and is home to a clock donated by alumna [[Eleanor Rathbone]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=28}}

===Chapel===
{{Main|Somerville College Chapel}}
[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - Chapel.JPG|thumb|right|[[Somerville College Chapel]]]]
Built largely with funds provided by alumna [[Emily Georgiana Kemp]] in 1935, [[Somerville Chapel]] reflects the nondenominational principle on which the college was founded in 1879. No religious texts were used for admission and nondenominational Christian prayers were said in college. The chapel's history, architecture, and artworks give valuable insights into the religious, intellectual, and cultural roots of what would subsequently become a global norm. The chapel can be seen as both a manifestation of the aspirations of liberal Christianity in the interwar years, including the advancement of women and ecumenism, and of the contestation of the role of religion in higher education among elites in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17432200.2017.1418478 A House of Prayer for all Peoples? The Unique Case of Somerville College Chapel, Oxford] 5 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapel does not have a chaplain, but a 'Chapel Director' which is in keeping with its undenominational tradition. The chapel provides opportunities for Christian worship in addition to hosting speakers with a multi-faith range of religious perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/196/all/1/The_Chapel.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018062026/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/196/all/1/The_Chapel.aspx |archivedate=18 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel also has an excellent mixed-voice choir, the [[Choir of Somerville College, Oxford|Choir of Somerville College]], which tours and produces occasional CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somervillechoir.com/|title=Home|website=The [[Choir of Somerville College, Oxford]]|access-date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hostel and Holtby===
Hostel is a small block between House and Darbishire, completed in 1950 by [[Geddes Hyslop]].{{sfn|Fair|2014|p=357}} It houses 10 students over three floors. The Bursary is on the ground floor.&lt;ref name="blogs.some.ox.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.some.ox.ac.uk/mcr/college-map/|title=College Map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holtby, designed in 1951 and completed in 1956 by Hyslop,{{sfn|Fair|2014|p=357}} is situated above the library extension, adjacent to Park. It has 10 rooms for undergraduates and is named for alumna [[Winifred Holtby]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://blogs.some.ox.ac.uk/jcr/{{Not a typo|accom|odation}}/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaughan and Margery Fry &amp; Elizabeth Nuffield House===
Designed by [[Sir Philip Dowson]] between 1958 and 1966, [[Janet Vaughan|Vaughan]] and [[Margery Fry]] &amp; [[Elizabeth Nuffield]] House (commonly shortened to Margery Fry) are both named for former principals of the college, whilst Elizabeth Nuffield was an important proponent of women's education and along with her husband [[Lord Nuffield]], a financial benefactor of the college. Margery Fry was opened in 1964 by [[Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit]] and Vaughan was opened in 1966. Constructed in the same architectural style, with an exterior concrete frame standing away from the walls of the interior edifice, the two buildings sit atop a podium containing shops and an arcaded walkway on Little Clarendon Street.

Vaughan is the larger of the two, with 11 rows to its concrete frame compared to the 8 of Margery Fry.&lt;ref name="manchesterhistory.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manchesterhistory.net/architecture/1960/somerville.html|title=Somerville College 1960s, Oxford, UK|website=''manchesterhistory.net''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed building.&lt;ref name=thetab&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetab.com/uk/oxford/2016/01/19/somerville-first-choice-25551|last=Haberfield|first=Catrin|title=Somerville should have been your first choice|publisher=''[[The Tab]]''|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughan contains around 60 undergraduate rooms, which are smaller than those of Margery Fry and house exclusively first year students, along with the junior deans. Vaughan was refurbished in 2013, with new bathroom facilities, including, for the first time, sinks. Beneath the two buildings, a tunnel provides access to Somerville from [[Little Clarendon Street]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Margery Fry serves as the centre of the post graduate student community at Somerville and contains 24 graduate rooms. Other accommodation for graduate students is provided in buildings adjacent to the College.

===Wolfson===
[[File:Wolfson building, Somerville College, Oxford in 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Wolfson building]]
Sir Philip Dowson was commissioned to design a building at the back of the college, to house undergraduates and offices for fellows. Wolfson is, in common with Dowson's other work in Somerville, constructed largely of glass and concrete. It is a [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed building.&lt;ref name="manchesterhistory.net"/&gt; A four-storey building, with five bays of each floor, Wolfson boasts impressive views of [[Walton Street]] from the rear and Somerville's main quadrangle from the front.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Wolfson is named for the building's principal benefactor [[Sir Isaac Wolfson]] and opened in 1967 by Principal [[Barbara Craig]], with [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] and Lord Wolfson giving speeches.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=45}}

The ground floor of the building contains the Flora Anderson Hall or FAH and the Brittain-Williams Room, named for the college's most famous mother-daughter alumnae. The room was designed in 2012 by [[Niall McLaughlin]] Architects and opened on 29 November 2013 by alumna Baroness [[Shirley Williams]] during an event which saw her unveil a portrait of herself, which now hangs in the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/191-6652/all/1/Shirley_Williams_opens_Brittain-Williams_Room_at_Somerville.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818105853/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/191-6652/all/1/Shirley_Williams_opens_Brittain-Williams_Room_at_Somerville.aspx |archivedate=18 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAH is used for lectures and events. Notably it hosts college parties and mock exams known as bops and [[Collection (Oxford colleges)|Collections]] respectively.

===Margaret Thatcher Centre and Dorothy Hodgkin Quadrangle===
Named for the [[Margaret Thatcher|alumna-Prime Minister]], the MTC comprises a lobby, lecture room and ante room used for many meetings, with disabled access. The lecture room enjoys AV facilities and can accommodate 60 seated patrons. The venue is used for certain term time events and is popular with conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conference-oxford.com/venues/conference/somerville-college|title=Somerville College – Conference Oxford|website=conference-oxford.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bust of Margaret Thatcher stands in the lobby, and the meeting room contains portraits of Somerville's two prime-minister alumnae, Margaret Thatcher by [[Michael Noakes]] and Indira Gandhi by Sanjay Bhattacharyya.

The Dorothy Hodgkin Quad (DHQ) was conceived in 1985 and completed in 1991.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=47}} It houses mainly finalists and some second year students. The Quadrangle is above the MTC and designed around self-contained flats of two and four bedrooms with communal kitchens. DHQ is named for Somerville's [[Dorothy Hodgkin|Nobel Prize winning laureate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Architect Geoffrey Beard's scheme was submitted to the [[Oxford City Council]] in 1986 and energies of Sir [[Geoffrey Leigh]] and alumna and former Principal Baroness [[Daphne Park]] brought support from around the world. The buildings were opened in 1991 by Margaret Thatcher, Dorothy Hodgkin, Principal [[Catherine Hughes (civil servant)|Catherine Hughes]] and College Visitor Baron [[Roy Jenkins]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=48}}

===St Paul’s Nursery===
Somerville College was the first Oxford college to provide a [[nursery school|nursery]] for the children of Fellows and staff and is still one of the few colleges to do so. Alumna [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] donated much of her Nobel Prize money to the project.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=49}} St Paul’s Nursery is also open to families who are not connected with the college and cares for 16 children between the ages of 3 months and 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/living-here/st-pauls-nursery/|title=St Paul's Nursery|website=www.some.ox.ac.uk|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radcliffe Observatory Quarter===
[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - ROQ.JPG|thumb|right|ROQ East from outside College]]
[[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter|ROQ]] East and West flank the north side of Somerville and overlook the site of the university's principal development, the [[Blavatnik School of Government]]. Completed in 2011, the ROQ buildings were the first buildings on the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter and have won 4 awards for their architect Niall McLaughlin. The project was also awarded Oxford City Council's David Steel Sustainable Building Award, being commended for its balancing of Somervillian collegiate heritage with the need for energy efficiency to be a consideration for the new building. Energy efficiency measures include renewable technologies such as solar thermal energy and ground source heat pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/191-6194/all/1/ROQ_accommodation_wins_sustainable_building_award.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818110249/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/191-6194/all/1/ROQ_accommodation_wins_sustainable_building_award.aspx |archivedate=18 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings house 68 students and all rooms are en-suite. There are a number of rooms and facilities specifically designed to help those with disabilities, including lifts and adjoining carer rooms. The buildings were made possible by donations of over £2.7&amp;nbsp;million from over 1000 alumni and friends of the college, and by a significant loan.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; There is now an unimpeded view of the Observatory.

===The Terrace===
The most recent construction in Somerville (2013), the college bar in Vaughan replaces the bar in House. The bar is housed in a mainly glass structure, with seating in the college colours of red and black. Following a campaign by the JCR [[Guinness]] is now available on tap, and the pool table costs 50p per frame. The college drink, the "Stone-cold Jane Austen", is made from blue [[alcopop|VK]], [[Southern Comfort]], and [[Magners]] cider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cherwell.org/2007/06/01/drink-the-bar-dry-worcester-st-hughs-sommerville/|title=Drink the bar dry: Worcester, St Hugh's, Sommerville|author=''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]''|date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other college drinks are the "Somerville Sunset" and the "College Triple". The college also has its own 'Somerville wine': red, white and sparkling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.fliphtml5.com/kpdf/yhsh/|title=Somerville College Wine List|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catherine Hughes Building===
Named after Somerville's late Principal from 1989 to 1996, the [[Catherine Hughes (civil servant)|Catherine Hughes]] Building will be completed in October 2019 and will provide 68 additional bedrooms. The new building, designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects, boasts en suite bathrooms, kitchens and accessible rooms on every floor and a new communal study area for students.&lt;ref name=hughes /&gt;

The red brick building will have a frontage on to Walton Street and additional access from the college gardens, aligning with key levels on the adjacent Penrose Building. The bedrooms will be arranged in clusters with kitchens and circulation spaces forming social focal points.

The building's construction has given Somerville sufficient accommodation to allow all students applying from 2017 to live in college for the entirety of their 3 to 4-year undergraduate degree and Somerville is one of only three Oxford colleges able to do so.&lt;ref name=Oxfordwebsite /&gt;&lt;ref name=whychoose /&gt;

===Gardens===
[[File:	Somerville College Oxford, Vaughan in autumn.jpg|thumb|View on Vaughan from Main Quad]]
Somerville is the only Oxford college where students may walk on the grass and it has a vast green space behind the unassuming front gate, looked after by two gardeners.&lt;ref name=gardens&gt;[https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/living-here/gardens/ Somerville Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original site comprised a [[paddock]], an [[orchard]] and a vegetable garden and was bounded by large trees. It was home to a [[donkey]], two [[cow]]s a [[pony]] and a [[pig]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=11}} The paddock was soon transformed into [[tennis court]]s, where huge tents where erected during WWI. During [[World War Two]], large water tanks were dug in the Main Quad and Darbishire Quad, in case or firebombing and the lawns were dug up and planted with vegetables.{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=35}}

In the Main Quad there's a [[Cedrus|cedar]] planted by [[Harold Macmillan]] in 1976, after an old cedar was victim of a winter storm. Another tree, a ''[[Picea likiangensis]]'', was planted in 2007 on the chapel lawn, providing Somerville with an outdoor [[Christmas tree]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=35}} The library border of [[lavender]] and ''[[Agapanthus]]'' references the [[bluestocking]] reputation of Somerville and the [[tory]] blue ''[[Ceratostigma willmottianum]]'' is planted outside the Margaret Thatcher Centre. [[Beardtongues]], ''[[Begonia]]'' and 1,200 red and black [[tulip]]s reflect the college's colours. There are nods to Somerville's long-standing links with [[India]], a strip of [[Alpine plant]]s in front of Wolfson, a [[bog garden]], [[herbaceous border]]s and the emblematic Somerville [[thistle]]s (''[[Echinops]]'').&lt;ref name=gardens /&gt;{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=36}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/news/ever-green-robert-washington-celebrates-30-years-at-somerville/|title=EVER GREEN – Robert Washington celebrates 30 years at Somerville|date=11 June 2014|website=www.some.ox.ac.uk|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western wall of Penrose and the northern wall of Vaughan form two faces of the Fellows Garden, previously [[kitchen garden]]s, which is distinct from the main quad and separated from it by a hedge and a wall. The Fellows Garden is home to a sundial, commissioned in 1926, and a [[garden roller]] which was a gift from the parents of tutor [[Rose Sidgwick]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=29}}

In 1962, [[Henry Moore]] lend his item ''Falling Warrior'' to the college and [[Barbara Hepworth]] lent ''Core'' shortly afterwards. Permanent sculptures in Somerville's garden are made by [[Wendy Taylor]], [[Friedrich Werthmann]] and [[Somervillian]] [[Polly Ionides]].

==Student life==
[[File:Somerville College Hall in snow.jpg|thumb|right|Somerville College in snow]]
In 2011 student satisfaction was rated in some categories as the highest in the university.&lt;ref name=satisfaction&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordstudent.com/2012/04/19/somerville-soars-in-satisfaction-survey/|title=Somerville soars in satisfaction survey|first=Jonathan|last=Tomlin|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the college is its large quad, onto which most accommodation blocks back; it is often filled with students in summer. Somerville is the only Oxford college where students (as opposed to just fellows) may walk on the grass.&lt;ref name=bs /&gt;&lt;ref name=thetab /&gt; Somerville is sometimes nicknamed ''The Ville''. [[Formal (university)|Formal Halls]] take place on some Tuesdays and Fridays about six times a term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.some.ox.ac.uk/mcr/graduate-community/formal-dinners/|title=Formal Dinners|publisher=Somerville College MCR|access-date=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[Academic dress of the University of Oxford#gowns|gowns]] are worn and the [[grace (prayer)|grace]] is 'benedictus benedicat'.

===Sports===
Somerville has a gym situated beneath Vaughan, with treadmills, cross-trainers and weights. Somerville shares a sports ground with [[Wadham College]] and [[St. Hugh's College]], on [[Marston Ferry Road]]. There are clubs and teams in men's and women's [[football]], [[rugby football|rugby]] (with [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi]]), mixed [[lacrosse]], [[cricket]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[hockey]], [[netball]], [[basketball]], [[pool (cue sports)|pool]], [[water polo]], [[tennis]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[badminton]], [[cycling]] and [[croquet]].&lt;ref name=sports&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.some.ox.ac.uk/mcr/graduate-community/sports/|title=Sports - MCR website|first=|last=|date=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.some.ox.ac.uk/jcr/social/sports/|title=Sports - JCR website|first=|last=|date=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rowing====
[[File:Somerville College Boat Club Rowing Blade.svg|thumb|right|Rowing blade design of [[Somerville College Boat Club]]]]
{{Main|Somerville College Boat Club}}
Somerville formed a rowing team in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scbcrowing.com/?page_id=10|title=History – Somerville College Boat Club|website=''scbcrowing.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college competes in both of the annual university [[bumps race]]s, [[Torpids]] and [[Summer Eights]]. The women are the most successful women's rowing team at the University of Oxford, having won the title Head of the River eight times in Summer Eights and five times in Torpids. The club shares the award-winning [[University College Boathouse]] on [[The Isis]] with [[St Peter's College, Oxford|St Peter's College]], [[University College, Oxford|University College]] and [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]].

===Choir===
{{main|Choir of Somerville College, Oxford}}
[[File:Somerville College Oxford, Chapel inside.jpg|thumb|right|[[Somerville College Chapel]]]]
The [[Choir of Somerville College, Oxford|Choir of Somerville College]] is mixed voice and is led by the Director of Chapel Music, Will Dawes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/news/will-dawes-appointed-as-director-of-chapel-music/|title=Will Dawes appointed as Director of Chapel Music – Somerville College Oxford|publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the organ scholars, the choir is central to the musical life of the college.

There are regular concerts and cathedral visits as well as recitals featuring soloists from the choir. In recent years the choir has undertaken tours of Germany (2005 and 2009), Italy (2010) and the USA (2014 and 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somervillechoir.com/tours.html|title=Tours|website=The Choir of Somerville College, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choir sings every Sunday during term time at the evening service. The organ of the college chapel is a traditionally voiced instrument by [[Harrison &amp; Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npor.org.uk/NPORView.html?RI=N07885|title=The National Pipe Organ Register – NPOR|website=''npor.org.uk''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somerville offers up to five Choral Exhibitions each year to applicants reading any subject. College Organ Scholars are guaranteed rooms in college for the duration of their course.

The college choir has released two CDs on the [[Stone Records]] label, "Requiem Aeternam" (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classical-iconoclast.blogspot.de/2012/09/durufle-milford-requiem-aeternam-stone.html|title=Milford, Duruflé Requiem Aeternam – Stone Records|website=classical-iconoclast.blogspot.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Advent Calendar" (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stonerecords.co.uk/album/advent-calendar|title=Advent calendar  ::  Stone Records, Independent Classical Music|website=''stonerecords.co.uk''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triennial Ball===
Once every three years Somerville hosts a ball which is organised with [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. The last ball was held in May 2016 and the next ball will be held in 2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/news/somerville-jesus-ball-enter-the-subconscious-mind/|title=The Somerville-Jesus Surrealism Ball: Enter the Subconscious Mind|date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a capacity of 1500 people.

The 2013 ball, ''The Last Ball'', was mired in controversy, which was reported in national news. The organisers had intended to display a live [[nurse shark]] as entertainment. Permission for the shark was initially granted by principal [[Alice Prochaska]], but was subsequently revoked following student protests. The ball was widely condemned for poor organisation, examples of which included a lack of [[canapé]]s and the presence of only one food stand, serving [[pork]]; the vegetarian options were said to run out quickly and revellers were reportedly set on fire by the pork [[rotisserie]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported 'The ball descended into farce with guests questioning what the organisers had done with the money paid by 1,000 guests.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/24/oxford-cancel-display-shark-ball_n_3144870.html|title=Oxford's Somerville College Cancels Student Plans To Display Living Nurse Shark At Summer Ball|first=Lucy|last=Sherriff|publisher=''[[HuffPost]]''|date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/student-life/10013881/Oxford-ball-scraps-shark-plans-after-student-protest.html|title=Oxford ball scraps shark plans after student protest|first=Andrew|last=Marszal|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''|date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxfordstudent&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetab.com/uk/oxford/2013/05/13/review-somerville-jesus-ball-9515|title=Review: Somerville-Jesus Ball|first=Will|last=Dufton|publisher=''[[The Tab]]''|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2013/05/23/somer-them-say-sorry-for-their-balls-up/|title=Somer' Them Say Sorry For Their Balls Up|first=Sarah|last=Poulten|publisher=''[[The Oxford Student]]''|date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cherwell.org/2013/05/09/somervillejesus-last-ball-goers-are-ripped-off/|title=Somerville-Jesus 'Last Ball' goers are "ripped off"|first=Nathalie|last=Wright|publisher=''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]''|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/may/25/student-ball-oxford-university-catastrophe|title=Student ball at Oxford University ends in 'catastrophe'|first=Conal|last=Urquhart|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic reputation===
[[File:Somerville CollegeNorrington Ranking.svg|thumb|Somerville's Position in the Norrington Table since 2006]]
Before men were admitted to the college, and under the principalship of [[Barbara Craig]], Somerville established a position at, or near the head of the Norrington Table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/3351/all/1/From_strength_to_strength.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618061455/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/3351/all/1/From_strength_to_strength.aspx |archivedate=18 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, by academic performance, Somerville is in the lower half of Oxford University colleges. 
For the academic year 2016/17, the college came 22nd out of 30 in the [[Norrington Table]], which lists the University's undergraduate colleges in order of their students' examination performances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ox.ac.uk/about/facts-and-figures/undergraduate-degree-classifications?wssl=1 "2016-17 Final Norrington Table"]. ox.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2018-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University Challenge===
Somerville has recently enjoyed success on TV quiz show ''[[University Challenge]]'' disproportionate to the college's size. The college has won the competition once, triumphing in the [[University Challenge 2001–02]] series and beating [[Imperial College, London|Imperial College]], London by 200 points to 185. [[Croatia]]n quizzer [[Dorjana Širola]] was one of the contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = University Challenge Series Champions in 2002 | url = http://www.blanchflower.org/uc/uc02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, the college team reached the final of the [[University Challenge 2013–14]] series, losing in the final to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], with a score of 134 to 240.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10749365/University-Challenge-the-2014-final-review-Trinity-triumph.html|title=University Challenge, the 2014 final, review: Trinity triumph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trinitatis Horribilis 2015===
During Trinity term 2015, Somerville was subject to national media coverage as a result of the efforts of principal [[Alice Prochaska]] to tackle 'a rise in "excessively harassing and intimidating behaviour" towards female students.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-32752506 Somerville College principal warns of sexual harassment], ''[[BBC News]]'', 15 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' quoted Prochaska as describing 'numerous reports of groping at college parties, rape jokes overheard in communal areas'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11604453/Oxford-chief-warns-of-worrying-culture-of-sexual-harassment-and-groping.html Oxford chief warns of worrying culture of sexual harassment and groping], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 14 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The principal wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' of measures taken to address harassment and she expressed her hope that 'a spasm of nastiness among a small minority of students here has been nipped in the bud by the open condemnation of the majority.'&lt;ref name=laddism /&gt;

Somerville educated at least twenty-six [[Dame]]s, fourteen [[Heads of Houses|heads]] of [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|Oxford colleges]], ten [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]'s, ten [[life peer]]s, four [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] rowers,&lt;ref name=olympics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about/oxford-people/Oxford-at-the-Olympics|title=Oxford at the Olympics|access-date=26 August 2018|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; three of ''The 50 greatest British writers since 1945'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-50-greatest-british-writers-since-1945-ws3g69xrf90|title=The 50 greatest British writers since 1945|date=5 January 2008|publisher=''[[The Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; two [[prime minister]]s, two [[princess]]es, a [[queen consort]] and a [[Nobel laureate]].

Formers students of Somerville belong to an alumni group, the Somerville Association, which was originally founded in 1888.{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=43}}

{{main|List of Principals of Somerville College, Oxford}}
The first principal of Somerville Hall was [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefèvre]] (from 1879–1889). The first principal of Somerville College was [[Agnes Catherine Maitland]] (1889–1906) when in 1894 it became the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of 'college', the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, the first to set an entrance examination, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]]. She was succeeded by classical scholar [[Emily Penrose]] (1906–1926), who established the ''Mary Somerville Research Fellowship'' in 1903 which was the first to offer women in Oxford opportunities for research.

The current Principal is [[Janet Royall, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon]] who took up the appointment in August 2017, succeeding [[Alice Prochaska]].&lt;ref name="ox" /&gt;

Six principals were alumnae of Somerville, two of [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's College]].

==Coat of arms and motto==
Like all Oxford colleges, Somerville has a variety of symbols and colours which are associated with it. The college's colours, which feature on the [[Academic scarf|college scarf]] and on the blades of its boats, are red and black. The combination was originally adopted in the 1890s.{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=47}} Its flag has the shield from the arms on a yellow background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb_ousom.html|title=Oxford University - Somerville College (England)|website=www.crwflags.com|date=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two colours also feature in the college's [[coat of arms]] which depicts three [[Star (heraldry)|mullets]] in [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] reversed [[gules]], between six [[Cross#As emblems and symbols|crosses crosslet fitched]] [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]]. The college's motto is ''Donec rursus impleat orbem'' which was originally the motto of the family of [[Mary Somerville]].{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=47}} Her family befriended the new hall, allowing it to adopt their arms and motto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oac.web.ox.ac.uk/somerville-college|title=Somerville College|website=Oxford College Archives|access-date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin]] motto itself is described as "baffling" as, although it translates as "Until It Should Fill the World Again", what the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence ("it") is left unspecified.{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=47}} The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], which is often omitted, is a hand grasping a [[crescent]] and occasionally a [[helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] with [[mantling]] is added.

{{Calculus|Vector}}

In [[vector calculus]], and more generally [[differential geometry]], '''Stokes' theorem''' (also called the '''generalized Stokes theorem''' or the '''Stokes–Cartan theorem'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789400745575|title=Physics of Collisional Plasmas – Introduction to {{!}} Michel Moisan {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a statement about the [[integral|integration]] of [[differential form]]s on [[manifolds]], which both simplifies and generalizes several [[theorem]]s from [[vector calculus]].  Stokes' theorem says that the integral of a differential form {{mvar|ω}} over the [[boundary of a manifold|boundary]] of some [[orientation (vector space)#Orientation on manifolds|orientable]] manifold {{math|Ω}} is equal to the integral of its [[exterior derivative]] {{mvar|dω}} over the whole of {{math|Ω}}, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial \Omega}\omega=\int_\Omega d\omega\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Stokes' theorem was formulated in its modern form by [[Élie Cartan]] in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Les Systèmes Différentiels Extérieurs et leurs Applications Géométriques|last=Cartan|first=Élie|publisher=Hermann|year=1945|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; following earlier work on the generalization of the theorems of vector calculus by [[Vito Volterra]], [[Édouard Goursat]], and [[Henri Poincaré]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|date=1979-01-01|title=The History of Stokes' Theorem|jstor=2690275|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=52|issue=3|pages=146–156|doi=10.2307/2690275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Topology|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|publisher=Elsevier|year=1999|isbn=9780444823755|editor-last=James|editor-first=I.

This modern form of Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of a [[#Kelvin–Stokes theorem|classical result]] that [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] communicated to [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]] in a letter dated July 2, 1850.&lt;ref&gt;See:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_\Gamma \mathbf{F}\, \cdot\, d{\mathbf{\Gamma}}  = \iint_S \nabla\times\mathbf{F}\, \cdot\, d\mathbf{S} &lt;/math&gt;

This classical statement, along with the classical [[divergence theorem]], the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], and [[Green's theorem]] are simply special cases of the general formulation stated above.

== Introduction ==
The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that the [[integral]] of a function {{mvar|f}} over the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} can be calculated by finding an [[antiderivative]] {{mvar|F}} of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|f}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of this theorem in the following sense. 
* By the choice of {{mvar|F}}, {{math|1={{sfrac|''dF''|''dx''}} = ''f''(''x'')}}. In the parlance of [[differential form]]s, this is saying that {{math|''f''(''x'')&amp;thinsp;''dx''}} is the [[exterior derivative]] of the 0-form, i.e. function, {{mvar|F}}: in other words, that {{math|1=''dF'' = ''f''&amp;thinsp;''dx''}}. The general Stokes theorem applies to higher differential forms {{mvar|ω}} instead of just 0-forms such as {{mvar|F}}.
* A closed interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is a simple example of a one-dimensional [[manifold with boundary]].  Its boundary is the set consisting of the two points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. Integrating {{mvar|f}} over the interval may be generalized to integrating forms on a higher-dimensional manifold. Two technical conditions are needed: the manifold has to be [[orientable]], and the form has to be [[compact support|compactly supported]] in order to give a well-defined integral.
* The two points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} form the boundary of the closed interval. More generally, Stokes' theorem applies to oriented manifolds {{mvar|M}} with boundary. The boundary {{math|∂''M''}} of {{mvar|M}} is itself a manifold and inherits a natural orientation from that of {{mvar|M}}. For example, the natural orientation of the interval gives an orientation of the two boundary points. Intuitively, {{mvar|a}} inherits the opposite orientation as {{mvar|b}}, as they are at opposite ends of the interval. So, "integrating" {{mvar|F}} over two boundary points {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} is taking the difference {{math|''F''(''b'') − ''F''(''a'')}}.
In even simpler terms, one can consider the points as boundaries of curves, that is as 0-dimensional boundaries of 1-dimensional manifolds. So, just as one can find the value of an integral ({{math|1=''f''&amp;thinsp;''dx'' = ''dF''}}) over a 1-dimensional manifold ({{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}) by considering the anti-derivative ({{mvar|F}}) at the 0-dimensional boundaries ({{math|{''a'', ''b''}|}}), one can generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus, with a few additional caveats, to deal with the value of integrals ({{mvar|dω}}) over {{mvar|n}}-dimensional manifolds ({{math|Ω}}) by considering the antiderivative ({{mvar|ω}}) at the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional boundaries ({{math|∂Ω}}) of the manifold.

So the fundamental theorem reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{[a, b]} f(x)\,dx = \int_{[a, b]} dF = \int_{\{a\}^- \cup \{b\}^+} F = F(b) - F(a)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Formulation for smooth manifolds with boundary==
Let {{math|Ω}} be an oriented [[smooth manifold]] with boundary of [[dimension]] {{mvar|n}} and let {{mvar|α}} be a [[smooth function|smooth]] {{mvar|n}}-[[differential form]] that is [[Support (mathematics)#Compact support|compactly supported]] on {{math|Ω}}. First, suppose that {{mvar|α}} is compactly supported in the domain of a single, [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[coordinate chart]] {{math|{''U'', ''φ''}|}}. In this case, we define the integral of {{mvar|α}} over {{math|Ω}} as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \alpha = \int_{\varphi(U)} \left(\varphi^{-1}\right)^* \alpha\,,&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., via the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of {{mvar|α}} to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

More generally, the integral of {{mvar|α}} over {{math|Ω}} is defined as follows: Let {{math|{''ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}} be a [[partition of unity]] associated with a [[locally finite collection|locally finite]] [[cover (topology)|cover]] {{math|{''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}} of (consistently oriented) coordinate charts, then define the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \alpha \equiv \sum_i \int_{U_i} \psi_i \alpha\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where each term in the sum is evaluated by pulling back to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} as described above.  This quantity is well-defined; that is, it does not depend on the choice of the coordinate charts, nor the partition of unity.

The generalized Stokes theorem reads:

{{quotebox|align=center|quote='''Theorem.''' ''(Stokes–Cartan) If &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a [[infinitely differentiable|smooth]] &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-[[differential form|form]] with [[compact support]] on smooth &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[manifold|manifold-with-boundary]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[boundary of a manifold|boundary]] of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; given the induced [[orientation (mathematics)#Geometric algebra|orientation]], and &lt;math&gt;i:\partial \Omega\hookrightarrow \Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[inclusion map]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega d\omega = \int_{\partial \Omega} i^*\omega&lt;/math&gt;.''}}

Conventionally, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\int_{\partial\Omega} i^*\omega&lt;/math&gt; is abbreviated as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\int_{\partial\Omega} \omega&lt;/math&gt;, since the pullback of a differential form by the inclusion map is simply its restriction to its domain: &lt;math&gt;i^*\omega=\omega|_{\partial\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;.  Here &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[exterior derivative]], which is defined using the manifold structure only.  The right-hand side is sometimes written as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\oint_{\partial\Omega} \omega&lt;/math&gt; to stress the fact that the &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-manifold &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; has no boundary.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For  mathematicians this fact is known, therefore the circle is redundant and often omitted.  However, one should keep in mind here that in [[thermodynamics]], where frequently expressions as {{math|∮&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; {''d''&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;''U''}|}} appear (wherein the total derivative, see below, should not be confused with the exterior one), the integration path {{mvar|W}} is a one-dimensional closed line on a much higher-dimensional manifold. That is, in a thermodynamic application, where {{mvar|U}} is a function of the temperature {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; :{{=}} ''T''}}, the volume {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; :{{=}} ''V''}}, and the electrical polarization {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; :{{=}} ''P''}} of the sample, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\{d_\text{total}U\}=\sum_{i=1}^3\frac{\partial U}{\partial\alpha_i}\,d\alpha_i\,,&lt;/math&gt;
and the circle is really necessary, e.g. if one considers the ''differential'' consequences of the ''integral'' postulate
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_W\,\{d_\text{total}U\}\, \stackrel{!}{=}\,0\,.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (This fact is also an implication of Stokes' theorem, since for a given smooth &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional manifold &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, application of the theorem twice gives &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\int_{\partial(\partial \Omega)}\omega=\int_\Omega d(d\omega)=0&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;(n-2)&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt;\partial(\partial\Omega)=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.) The right-hand side of the equation is often used to formulate ''integral'' laws; the left-hand side then leads to equivalent ''differential'' formulations (see below).

The theorem is often used in situations where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold, often &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^k&lt;/math&gt;, on which the form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined.

==Topological preliminaries; integration over chains==

Let {{mvar|M}} be a [[smooth manifold]]. A (smooth) singular [[Simplex|{{mvar|k}}-simplex]] in {{mvar|M}} is defined as a [[smooth map]] from the standard simplex in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{mvar|M}}. The group {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'', '''Z''')}} of singular {{mvar|k}}-[[chain (algebraic topology)|chains]] on {{mvar|M}} is defined to be the [[free abelian group]] on the set of singular {{mvar|k}}-simplices in {{mvar|M}}. These groups, together with the boundary map, {{math|∂}}, define a [[chain complex]]. The corresponding homology (resp. cohomology) group is isomorphic to the usual [[singular homology]] group {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'', '''Z''')}} (resp. the [[singular cohomology]] group {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'', '''Z''')}}), defined using continuous rather than smooth simplices in {{mvar|M}}.

On the other hand, the differential forms, with exterior derivative, {{mvar|d}}, as the connecting map, form a cochain complex, which defines the [[de Rham cohomology]] groups {{math|''H''{{su|p=''k''|b=''dR''}}(''M'', '''R''')}}.

Differential {{mvar|k}}-forms can be integrated over a {{mvar|k}}-simplex in a natural way, by pulling back to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Extending by linearity allows one to integrate over chains. This gives a linear map from the space of {{mvar|k}}-forms to the {{mvar|k}}th group of singular cochains, {{math|''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''(''M'', '''Z''')}}, the linear functionals on {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''M'', '''Z''')}}. In other words, a {{mvar|k}}-form {{mvar|ω}} defines a functional

:&lt;math&gt;I(\omega)(c) = \oint_c \omega&lt;/math&gt;

on the {{mvar|k}}-chains. Stokes' theorem says that this is a chain map from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology with real coefficients; the exterior derivative, {{mvar|d}}, behaves like the ''dual'' of {{math|∂}} on forms. This gives a homomorphism from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology. On the level of forms, this means:

#closed forms, i.e., {{math|''dω'' {{=}} 0}}, have zero integral over ''boundaries'', i.e. over manifolds that can be written as {{math|∂∑&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; ''M&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and
#exact forms, i.e., {{math|''ω'' {{=}} ''dσ''}}, have zero integral over ''cycles'', i.e. if the boundaries sum up to the empty set: {{math|∑&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; ''M&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ∅}}.

[[De Rham's theorem]] shows that this homomorphism is in fact an isomorphism. So the converse to 1 and 2 above hold true. In other words, if {{math|{''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}} are cycles generating the {{mvar|k}}th homology group, then for any corresponding real numbers, {{math|{''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}}, there exist a closed form, {{mvar|ω}}, such that

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{c_i} \omega = a_i\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and this form is unique up to exact forms.

Stokes' theorem on smooth manifolds can be derived from Stokes' theorem for chains in smooth manifolds, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manifolds, Tensors, and Forms|last=Renteln|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781107324893|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=158–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Formally stated, the latter reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Smooth Manifolds|last=Lee|first=John M.|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9781441999818|location=New York|pages=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying principle ==
[[Image:Stokes patch.svg|200px|left]]
To simplify these topological arguments, it is worthwhile to examine the underlying principle by considering an example for {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2}} dimensions. The essential idea can be understood by the diagram on the left, which shows that, in an oriented tiling of a manifold, the interior paths are traversed in opposite directions; their contributions to the path integral thus cancel each other pairwise. As a consequence, only the contribution from the boundary remains. It thus suffices to prove Stokes' theorem for sufficiently fine tilings (or, equivalently, [[simplex|simplices]]), which usually is not difficult.

{{Clear}}

==Generalization to rough sets==
[[Image:Green's-theorem-simple-region.svg|thumb|upright|180px|A region (here called {{mvar|D}} instead of {{math|Ω}}) with piecewise smooth boundary.  This is a [[manifold with corners]], so its boundary is not a smooth manifold.]]

The formulation above, in which {{math|Ω}} is a smooth manifold with boundary, does not suffice in many applications.  For example, if the domain of integration is defined as the plane region between two {{mvar|x}}-coordinates and the graphs of two functions, it will often happen that the domain has corners.  In such a case, the corner points mean that {{math|Ω}} is not a smooth manifold with boundary, and so the statement of Stokes' theorem given above does not apply.  Nevertheless, it is possible to check that the conclusion of Stokes' theorem is still true.  This is because {{math|Ω}} and its boundary are well-behaved away from a small set of points (a [[measure zero]] set).

A version of Stokes' theorem that extends to rough domains was proved by Whitney.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, ''Geometric Integration Theory,'' III.14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Assume that {{mvar|D}} is a connected bounded open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Call {{mvar|D}} a ''standard domain'' if it satisfies the following property: There exists a subset {{mvar|P}} of {{math|∂''D''}}, open in {{math|∂''D''}}, whose complement in {{math|∂''D''}} has [[Hausdorff measure|Hausdorff {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-measure]] zero; and such that every point of {{mvar|P}} has a ''generalized normal vector''.  This is a vector {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} such that, if a coordinate system is chosen so that {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} is the first basis vector, then, in an open neighborhood around {{mvar|x}}, there exists a smooth function {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} such that {{mvar|P}} is the graph {{math|{ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) }|}} and {{mvar|D}} is the region {{math|{ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) }|}}.  Whitney remarks that the boundary of a standard domain is the union of a set of zero Hausdorff {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-measure and a finite or countable union of smooth {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-manifolds, each of which has the domain on only one side.  He then proves that if {{mvar|D}} is a standard domain in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{mvar|ω}} is an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form which is defined, continuous, and bounded on {{math|''D'' ∪ ''P''}}, smooth on {{mvar|D}}, integrable on {{mvar|P}}, and such that {{mvar|dω}} is integrable on {{mvar|D}}, then Stokes' theorem holds, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_P \omega = \int_D d\omega\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The study of measure-theoretic properties of rough sets leads to [[geometric measure theory]].  Even more general versions of Stokes' theorem have been proved by Federer and by Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison|first=J.|title=Stokes' theorem for nonsmooth chains|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |series=New Series|volume=29|issue=2|date=October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special cases==
The general form of the Stokes theorem using differential forms is more powerful and easier to use than the special cases. The traditional versions can be formulated using [[Cartesian coordinates]] without the machinery of differential geometry, and thus are more accessible. Further, they are older and their names are more familiar as a result. The traditional forms are often considered more convenient by practicing scientists and engineers but the non-naturalness of the traditional formulation becomes apparent when using other coordinate systems, even familiar ones like spherical or cylindrical coordinates. There is potential for confusion in the way names are applied, and the use of dual formulations.

===Kelvin–Stokes theorem===
[[Image:Stokes' Theorem.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of the Kelvin–Stokes theorem, with surface {{math|Σ}}, its boundary {{math|∂Σ}} and the "normal" vector {{mvar|n}}.]]

This is a (dualized) (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional case, for a 1-form (dualized because it is a statement about [[vector field]]s). This special case is often just referred to as ''Stokes' theorem'' in many introductory university vector calculus courses and is used in physics and engineering. It is also sometimes known as the '''[[Curl (mathematics)|curl]]''' theorem.

The classical [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]] relates the [[surface integral]] of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a [[vector field]] over a surface {{math|Σ}} in Euclidean three-space to the [[line integral]] of the vector field over its boundary. It is a special case of the general Stokes theorem (with {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}) once we identify a vector field with a 1-form using the metric on Euclidean 3-space. The curve of the line integral, {{math|∂Σ}}, must have positive [[curve orientation|orientation]], meaning that {{math|∂Σ}} points counterclockwise when the [[normal (geometry)|surface normal]], {{math|'''n'''}}, points toward the viewer.

One consequence of the Kelvin–Stokes theorem is that the [[field line]]s of a vector field with zero curl cannot be closed contours. The formula can be rewritten as:

&lt;div align=left&gt;
&lt;div class="messagebox standard-talk NavFrame"&gt;
&lt;div align=left&gt;
Suppose {{math|'''F'''(''P''(''x'',''y'',''z''),''Q''(''x'',''y'',''z''),''R''(''x'',''y'',''z''))}} is defined in region with smooth surface {{math|Σ}} and has first-order continuous [[partial derivatives]]. Then
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \iint_\Sigma \Bigg(\left(\frac{\partial R}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial Q}{\partial z} \right)\,dy\,dz +\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial R}{\partial x} \right) \,dz\,dx  +\left (\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)\,dx\,dy\Bigg) \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; \oint_{\partial\Sigma} \Big(P\,dx+Q\,dy+R\,dz\Big)\,,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;where {{mvar|P}}, {{mvar|Q}} and {{mvar|R}} are the components of {{math|'''F'''}}, and {{math|∂Σ}} is boundary of region with smooth surface {{math|Σ}}.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Green's theorem===
[[Green's theorem]] is immediately recognizable as the third integrand of both sides in the integral in terms of {{mvar|P}}, {{mvar|Q}}, and {{mvar|R}} cited above.

====In electromagnetism====
Two of the four [[Maxwell equations]] involve curls of 3-D vector fields and their differential and integral forms are related by the [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]]. Caution must be taken to avoid cases with moving boundaries: the partial time derivatives are intended to exclude such cases. If moving boundaries are included, interchange of integration and differentiation introduces terms related to boundary motion not included in the results below (see [[Differentiation under the integral sign]]):

|}
The above listed subset of Maxwell's equations are valid for electromagnetic fields expressed in [[SI units]]. In other systems of units, such as [[Maxwell's equations#CGS units|CGS]] or [[Gaussian units]], the scaling factors for the terms differ. For example, in Gaussian units, Faraday's law of induction and Ampère's law take the forms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J.&amp;nbsp;D.|last=Jackson|title=Classical Electrodynamics|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley|location=New York, NY|date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=M.|last=Born|first2=E.|last2=Wolf|title=Principles of Optics|edition=6th|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \nabla \times \mathbf{E} &amp;= -\frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}\,, \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H} &amp;= \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}} {\partial t} + \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J}\,, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

respectively, where {{mvar|c}} is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum.

===Divergence theorem===
Likewise, the [[Divergence theorem|Ostrogradsky–Gauss theorem]] (also known as the divergence theorem or Gauss's theorem)

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\mathrm{Vol} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, d_\mathrm{Vol} = \oint_{\partial \mathrm{Vol}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

is a special case if we identify a vector field with the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form obtained by contracting the vector field with the Euclidean volume form. An application of this is the case {{math|'''F''' {{=}} ''f'''''c'''}} where {{math|'''c'''}} is an arbitrary constant vector. Working out the divergence of the product gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf c \cdot \int_\mathrm{Vol} \nabla f \, d_\mathrm{Vol} = \mathbf c \cdot \oint_{\partial \mathrm{Vol}} f\, d\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Since this holds for all {{math|'''c'''}} we find
:&lt;math&gt;\int_\mathrm{Vol} \nabla f \, d_\mathrm{Vol} = \oint_{\partial \mathrm{Vol}} f\, d\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11491">The discourses in philosophy regarding [[social relation]]. What [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] call "the principle of '''superficiality''' versus depth"&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007) p. 18-9&lt;/ref&gt; has pervaded [[Western culture]] since at least the time of [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Lacan]], ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1994) p. 71 and p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical sketch==

[[Socrates]] sought to convince his debaters to turn from the superficiality of a worldview based on the acceptance of convention to the examined life of philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn A. Morgan, ''Myth and Philosophy from the pre-Socratics to Plato'' (2000) p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; founded (as [[Plato]] at least considered) upon the underlying [[Theory of Forms|Ideas]]. For more than two millennia, there was in the Platonic wake a general valorisation of critical thought over the superficial subjectivity that refused deep analysis.&lt;ref&gt;M. R. Gladstein/C. M. Sicabarra, ''Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand'' (1999) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The salon style of the [[Précieuses]] might for a time affect superficiality, and play with the possibility of treating serious topics in a light-hearted fashion;&lt;ref&gt;A. De Riencout, ''Sex and Power in History'' (1974) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; but the prevailing western consensus firmly rejected elements such as everyday chatter&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Cusset, ''No Tomorrow'' (1996) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; or the changing vagaries of fashion&lt;ref&gt;G. D. McCracken, ''Transformations'' (2008) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; as superficial distractions from a deeper reality.

==Modernist cross-currents==

By contrast, [[Nietzsche]] opened the modernist era with a self-conscious praise of superficiality: "What is required is to stop courageously at the surface, the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words, in the whole Olympus of appearance! Those Greeks were superficial – ''out of profundity''!".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory Castle, ''The Blackwell Guide to Theory'' (OxfordLiteraryironic 2007) p.&lt;/ref&gt;

His (still) preference for superficiality was however over-shadowed for most of the 20th century by [[modernism]]'s full subscription to the depth/surface model, and to the privileging of the former over the latter. [[Frederic Jameson]] has highlighted four main modernist versions of the belief in a ''deeper'' reality - Marxist, psychoanalytic, existential, and semiotic -  in each of which reality is understood to be concealed behind an inauthentic surface or façade.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bennett/N. Royle, ''An Introduction to Literature, Criticism and Theory'' (2004) p. 253-4&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson contrast these models sharply with the lack of depth, the ahistoricity, the surface-focus and flatness of the postmodern consciousness, with its new [[cult]] of the image and the [[simulacrum]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 17 and p 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodernism==

In the last third of the 20th century, [[Lyotard]] began challenging the Platonic view of a true meaning hidden behind surface as a ''theatrical'' world-view, insisting instead that sense manifestations had their own reality which necessarily impacted upon the purely verbal order of intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;K. Chrome/J. Williams ed., ''The Lyotard Reader and Guide'' (2006) p. 24-8&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[deconstruction]] has increasingly sought to undo the depth/surface hierarchy, proposing in ironic style that superficiality is as deep as depth.&lt;ref&gt;Cusset, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The result has been the call to abandon the idea that behind appearances there is any ultimate truth to be found;&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 135-6&lt;/ref&gt; and in consequence the growing postmodern replacement of depth by surface, or by multiple surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Fredric Jameson, ''Postmodernism'' (London 1991) p. 2 and p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

That process of substitution was well under way by the 1990s, when notoriously "surface was depth",&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bracewell, ''The Nineties: when surface was depth'' (London 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the new millennium has led to a state of what has been called hypervisibility: everything is on view.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Toffoletti, ''Baudrillard Reframed'' (London 2011) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In this new era of exposure&lt;ref&gt;L. Magid/A. Collier, ''Myspace'' (2007) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; we are all submerged in what the psychoanalyst Michael Parsons has called "the totalist world where there is a horror of inwardness; everything must be revealed".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

If postmodernism's proponents welcomed the way a new transcendence of the surface /depth dichotomy allowed a fuller appreciation of the possibilities of the superficial&lt;ref&gt;Russell De Manning, ''Theology at the End of Culture'' (2005) p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; - the surface consciousness of the now, as opposed to the depths of historical time&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (Princeton 1992) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; - critics like [[J. G. Ballard]] object that the end-product is a world of "laws without penalties, events without significance, a sun without shadows":&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Ballard, ''Millennium People'' (London 2003) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; of surface without depth. They see postmodern superficiality as a by-product of the [[false consciousness]] of global capitalism, where surface distractions, news, and entertainment supersaturate the [[zapping]] mind in such a way as to foreclose the possibility of envisioning any critical alternative.&lt;ref&gt;David Edwards, ''Burning All Illusions'' (1996) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapy==

Almost all [[Depth psychology|depth psychologies]] defy the postmodern to value depth over surface - to aim, in [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]]'s words, for "change from the depths of oneself upwards into the ''superficies'' of one's social appearance".&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Debates may rage over whether to ''begin'' analysis at the surface or by way of  deep interpretations,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1997) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; but this is essentially a question of timing. Thus for example [[Jung]]ians would highlight at the start of therapy what they call the ''[[Persona (psychology)|persona-restoring]]'' phase as an effort to preserve superficiality, but would later optimally see the client moving from the surface to deeper emotion and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;David Sedgwick, ''Introduction to Jungian Psychotherapy'' (2006) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fritz Perls]] by contrast maintained that "the simplicity of the [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt]] approach is that we pay attention to the obvious, to the utmost surface. We don't delve into a region which we don't know anything about, into the so-called 'unconscious{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Perls, ''Gestalt Therapy Verbatim'' (1972) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; A similar focus on the superficial has fuelled much of the [[Freud Wars]] of [[late modernity]], in which, according to [[Jonathan Lear]], "the real object of attack - for which Freud is only a stalking-horse - is the very idea that humans have unconscious motivation".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lear, in Parsons, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Given a choice of surface or depth—"are we to see humans as having depth, layers of meaning which lie beneath the surface of their own understanding?"—he asks: "Or are we to take ourselves as transparent to ourselves...to ignore the complexity, depth and darkness of human life";&lt;ref&gt;Lear, in Parsons, p. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; the postmodern bias remains towards superficiality.

==Social processing==

[[Social psychology]] considers that in everyday life social processing veers between superficiality, where we rely on [[First impression (psychology)|first impressions]] and immediate judgements, and a deeper form of processing in which we seek to understand the other person more fully.&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 18 and p. 92-3&lt;/ref&gt; In the ordinary course of life, we necessarily take others at face-value,&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade''  (London 1972) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; and use [[ideal type]]s/[[stereotypes]] to guide our daily activities; while institutions too can rely on the superficial consensus of [[groupthink]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; to preclude deeper investigation.

Some circumstances however necessitate a shift from superficial to extensive processing. When things become serious, we must put more and deeper thought into understanding, leaving superficial judgements to cases where the stakes are low, not high.&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 554&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==

* [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley's]] novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' is his examination of American culture, particularly what he saw as its [[narcissism]], superficiality, and obsession with youth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29796">A reference frame in which the time [[coordinate]] defines [[proper time]] for all co-moving observers is called "synchronous". It is built by choosing some [[time-like]] [[hypersurface]] as an origin, such that has in every point a [[normal (geometry) | normal]] along the time line (lies inside the [[light cone]] with an apex in that point); all interval elements on this hypersurface are [[space-like]]. A family of [[geodesics]] normal to this hypersurface are drawn and defined as the time coordinates with a beginning at the hypersurface.

Such a construct, and hence, choice of synchronous frame, is always possible though it is not unique. It allows any transformation of space coordinates that does not depend on time and, additionally, a transformation brought about by the arbitrary choice of hypersurface used for this geometric construct.

== Synchronization over a curved space ==
[[Einstein synchronisation | Synchronization]] of clocks located at different space points means that events happening at different places can be measured as simultaneous if those clocks show the same times. In the special relativity theory, the space distance element ''dl'' is defined as the intervals between two very close events that occur at the same moment of time. In the general relativity theory this cannot be done, that is, one cannot define ''dl'' by just substituting ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 in the metric. The reason for this is the different dependence between [[proper time]] and time coordinate ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; in different points of space.
[[File:Synchronization.svg|250px|left|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Synchronization of clocks in curved space through light signals.]]
To find ''dl'' in this case, one can first synchronize time over the whole space in the following way (Fig. 1): Bob sends a light signal from some space point ''B'' with coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''dx''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; to Alice who is at a very close point ''A'' with coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; and then Alice immediately reflects the signal back to Bob. The time necessary for this operation (measured by Bob), multiplied by ''c'' is, obviously, the doubled distance between [[Alice and Bob]].

The squared interval, with separated space and time coordinates, is:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = g_{\alpha\beta}\, dx^\alpha\, dx^\beta + 2g_{0\alpha}\, dx^0\, dx^\alpha + g_{00} \left ( dx^0 \right )^2,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1}}}}
where a repeated Greek index within a term means summation by values 1, 2, 3. The interval between the events of signal arrival in point ''A'' and its immediate reflection back is zero (two events in the same time at the same point). Equation ''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 solved for ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; gives two roots:
: &lt;math&gt;dx^{0(1)} = \frac{1}{g_{00}} \left ( -g_{0\alpha}\, dx^\alpha - \sqrt{\left ( g_{0\alpha}g_{0\beta} - g_{\alpha \beta}g_{00} \right )\, dx^\alpha \,dx^\beta} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;dx^{0(2)} = \frac{1}{g_{00}} \left ( -g_{0\alpha}\, dx^\alpha + \sqrt{\left ( g_{0\alpha}g_{0\beta} - g_{\alpha \beta}g_{00} \right ) \,dx^\alpha \,dx^\beta} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2}}}}
which correspond to the propagation of the signal in both directions between Alice and Bob. If ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the moment of arrival/reflection of the signal to/from Alice, the moments of signal departure from Bob and its arrival back to Bob correspond, respectively, to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0 (1)&lt;/sup&gt; and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0 (2)&lt;/sup&gt;. The thick lines on Fig. 1 are the world lines of Alice and Bob with coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; + ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, while the red lines are the world lines of the signals. Fig. 1 supposes that ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0 (2)&lt;/sup&gt; is positive and ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0 (1)&lt;/sup&gt; is negative, which, however, is not necessarily the case: ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0 (1)&lt;/sup&gt; and ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;0 (2)&lt;/sup&gt; may have the same sign. The fact that in the latter case the value ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (Alice) in the moment of signal arrival at Alice's position may be less than the value ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (Bob) in the moment of signal departure from Bob does not contain a contradiction because clocks in different points of space are not supposed to be synchronized. It is clear that the full "time" interval between departure and arrival of the signal in Bob's place is

: &lt;math&gt;dx^{0(2)} - dx^{0(1)} = \frac{2}{g_{00}} \sqrt{\left ( g_{0\alpha}g_{0\beta} - g_{\alpha \beta}g_{00} \right ) \,dx^\alpha \,dx^\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

The respective proper time interval is obtained from the above relationship by multiplication by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{g_{00}}/c&lt;/math&gt;, and the distance ''dl'' between the two points – by additional multiplication by ''c''/2. As a result:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;dl^2 = \left ( -g_{\alpha \beta} + \frac{g_{0\alpha}g_{0\beta}}{g_{00}} \right )\, dx^\alpha \,dx^\beta.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 3}}}}
This is the required relationship that defines distance through the space coordinate elements.

It is obvious that such synchronization should be done by exchange of light signals between points. Consider again propagation of signals between infinitesimally close points ''A'' and ''B'' in Fig. 1. The clock reading in ''B'' which is simultaneous with the moment ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; in ''A'' lies in the middle between the moments of sending and receiving the signal in ''B''; this is the moment
:&lt;math&gt;x^0 + \Delta x^0 = x^0 + \tfrac{1}{2} \left ( dx^{0(2)} + dx^{0(1)} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;
Substitute here {{EquationNote|eq. 2}} to find the difference in "time" ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; between two simultaneous events occurring in infinitesimally close points as
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta x^0 = -\frac{g_{0 \alpha}\, dx^\alpha}{g_{00}} \equiv g_\alpha \,dx^\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 4}}}}
This relationship allows clock synchronization in any infinitesimally small space volume. By continuing such synchronization further from point ''A'', one can synchronize clocks, that is, determine simultaneity of events along any open line. The synchronization condition can be written in another form by multiplying {{EquationNote|eq. 4}} by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; and bringing terms to the left hand side  
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta x_0 = g_{0i} dx^i = 0&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 5}}}}
or, the "covariant differential" ''dx''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; between two infinitesimally close points should be zero.

However, it is impossible, in general, to synchronize clocks along a closed contour: starting out along the contour and returning to the starting point one would obtain a Δ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; value different from zero. Thus, unambiguous synchronization of clocks over the whole space is impossible. An exception are reference frames in which all components ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0α&lt;/sub&gt; are zeros.

Note the inability to synchronize all clocks is a property of the reference frame and not of the spacetime itself. It is always possible in infinitely many ways in any gravitational field to choose the reference frame so that the three ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0α&lt;/sub&gt; become zeros and thus enable a complete synchronization of clocks. To this class are assigned cases where ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0α&lt;/sub&gt; can be made zeros by a simple change in the time coordinate which does not involve a choice of a system of objects that define the space coordinates.

In the special relativity theory, too, proper time elapses differently for clocks moving relatively to each other. In general relativity, proper time is different even in the same reference frame at different points of space. This means that the interval of proper time between two events occurring at some space point and the time interval between the events simultaneous with those at another space point are, in general, different from one another.

== Space metric tensor ==

Rewrite {{EquationNote|eq. 3}} in the form

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;dl^2 = \gamma_{\alpha \beta} \,dx^\alpha\, dx^\beta,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 6}}}}

where

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\alpha \beta} = -g_{\alpha \beta} + \frac{g_{0\alpha}g_{0\beta}}{g_{00}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 7}}}}

is the three-dimensional metric tensor that determines the metric, that is, the geometrical properties of space. Equations {{EquationNote|eq. 7}} give the relationships between the metric of the three-dimensional space and the metric of the four-dimensional spacetime.

In general, however, the metric ''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' depends on ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; so that the space metric {{EquationNote|eq. 7}} changes with time. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to integrate ''dl'': this integral depends on the choice of world line between the two points on which it is taken. It follows that in general relativity the distance between two bodies cannot be determined in general; this distance is determined only for infinitesimally close points. Distance can be determined also for finite space regions only in such reference frames in which ''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' does not depend on time and therefore the integral '''∫'''''dl'' along the space curve acquires some definite sense.

The tensor&amp;nbsp;–γ&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt; is inverse to the contravariant 3-dimensional tensor ''g''&lt;sup&gt;αβ&lt;/sup&gt;. Indeed, writing equation ''g&lt;sup&gt;ik&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;kl&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\delta_l^i}&lt;/math&gt; in components, one has:

: &lt;math&gt;g^{\alpha \beta}g_{\beta \gamma} + g^{\alpha 0}g_{0 \gamma} = \delta_\gamma^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g^{\alpha \beta}g_{\beta 0} + g^{\alpha 0}g_{00} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eqs. 8}}}}

: &lt;math&gt;g^{0 \beta}g_{\beta 0} + g^{00}g_{00} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Determine ''g''&lt;sup&gt;α0&lt;/sup&gt; from the second equation and substitute in the first to obtain

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;-g^{\alpha \beta} \gamma_{\beta \gamma} = \delta_\gamma^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 9}}}}

which was to be demonstrated. This result can be presented otherwise by saying that ''g''&lt;sup&gt;αβ&lt;/sup&gt; are components of a contravariant 3-dimensional tensor corresponding to metric {{EquationNote|eq. 7}}:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\gamma^{\alpha \beta} = -g^{\alpha \beta}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 10}}}}

The determinants ''g'' and γ composed of elements ''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' and γ&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, are related to each other by the simple relationship:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;-g = g_{00}\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 11}}}}

In many applications, it is convenient to define a 3-dimensional vector '''g''' with covariant components

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g_\alpha = -\frac{g_{0 \alpha}}{g_{00}}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 12}}}}

Considering '''g''' as a vector in space with metric {{EquationNote|eq. 7}}, its contravariant components can be written as ''g''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; = γ&lt;sup&gt;αβ&lt;/sup&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;. Using {{EquationNote|eq. 11}} and the second of {{EquationNote|eqs. 8}}, it is easy to see that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g^\alpha = \gamma^{\alpha \beta} g_\beta = -g^{0 \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 13}}}}

From the third of {{EquationNote|eqs. 8}}, it follows

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g^{00} = \frac{1}{g_{00}} - g_\alpha g^\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 14}}}}

==Synchronous coordinates==

As concluded from {{EquationNote|eq. 5}}, the condition that allows clock synchronization in different space points is that metric tensor components ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0α&lt;/sub&gt; are zeros. If, in addition, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, then the time coordinate ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t'' is the proper time in each space point (with ''c'' = 1). A reference frame that satisfies the conditions
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g_{00} = 1, \quad g_{0 \alpha} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 15}}}}
is called ''synchronous frame''. The interval element in this system is given by the expression
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dt^2 - g_{\alpha \beta}\, dx^\alpha\, dx^\beta,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 16}}}}
with the spatial metric tensor components identical (with opposite sign) to the components ''g''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\alpha \beta} = -g_{\alpha \beta}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 17}}}}
[[File:Time lines.svg|300px|left|thumb|'''Figure 2.''' A synchronous reference frame built with the choice of the timelike hypersurface ''t'' = const (teal color). Only one spatial coordinate ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'' is shown. The four observers have the same proper times ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t'' which are normal to the hypersurface in their locally flat spacetimes (shown by the [[light cones]]). The unit vector ''n''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''u''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 is shown in yellow. There are no spatial components (''u''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; = 0) so the common proper time is a geodesic line with a beginning at the hypersurface and a positive direction (red arrows).]]
In synchronous frame time, time lines are normal to the hypersurfaces ''t'' = const. Indeed, the unit four-vector normal to such a hypersurface ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ∂''t''/∂''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' has covariant components ''n''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. The respective contravariant components with the conditions {{EquationNote|eq. 15}} are again ''n''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; = 0, ''n''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.

The components of the unit normal coincide with those of the four-vector ''u&lt;sup&gt; i&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''dx&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;/ds'' which is tangent to the world line ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = const. The ''u&lt;sup&gt; i&lt;/sup&gt;'' with components ''u''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; = 0, ''u''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 automatically satisfies the [[geodesics in general relativity|geodesic equations]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{du^i}{ds} + \Gamma_{kl}^i u^k u^l = \Gamma_{00}^i = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
since, from the conditions {{EquationNote|eq. 15}}, the Christoffel symbols &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{00}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{00}^0&lt;/math&gt; vanish identically. Therefore, in the synchronous reference system the time lines are geodesics in the spacetime.

These properties can be used to construct synchronous frame in any spacetime (Fig. 2). To this end, choose some [[spacelike]] [[hypersurface]] as an origin, such that has in every point a normal along the time line (lies inside the [[light cone]] with an apex in that point); all interval elements on this hypersurface are space-like. Then draw a family of geodesics normal to this hypersurface. Choose these lines as time coordinate lines and define the time coordinate ''t'' as the length ''s'' of the geodesic measured with a beginning at the hypersurface; the result is a synchronous frame.

An analytic transformation to synchronous frame can be done with the use of the [[Hamilton&amp;ndash;Jacobi equation]]. The principle of this method is based on the fact that particle trajectories in gravitational fields are geodesics. The [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation#HJE in a gravitational field|Hamilton&amp;ndash;Jacobi equation]] for a particle (whose mass is set equal to unity) in a gravitational field is
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g^{ik} \frac{\partial S}{\partial x^i} \frac{\partial S}{\partial x^k} = 1,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 18a}}}}
where ''S'' is the action. Its complete integral has the form:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;S = f \left ( \xi^{\alpha}, x^i \right ) + A \left ( \xi^{\alpha} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 18b}}}}
where ''f'' is a function of the four coordinates ''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' and the three parameters ξ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;; the constant ''A'' is treated as an arbitrary function of the three ξ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;. With such a representation for ''S'' the equations for the trajectory of the particle can be obtained by equating the derivatives ∂''S''/∂ξ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; to zero, i.e. 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial \xi^{\alpha}} = - \frac{\partial A}{\partial \xi^{\alpha}}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 18c}}}}
For each set of assigned values of the parameters ξ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;, the right sides of equations {{EquationNote|18a-18c}} have definite constant values, and the world line determined by these equations is one of the possible trajectories of the particle. Choosing the quantities ξ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;, which are constant along the trajectory, as new space coordinates, and the quantity ''S'' as the new time coordinate, one obtains a synchronous reference system; the transformation from the old coordinates to the new ones is given by equations {{EquationNote|18b-18c}}. In fact, it is guaranteed that for such a transformation the time lines will be geodesics and will be normal to the hypersurfaces ''S'' = const. The latter point is obvious from the mechanical analogy: the four-vector ∂''S''/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; which is normal to the hypersurface coincides in mechanics with the four-momentum of the particle, and therefore coincides in direction with its four-velocity ''u''&lt;sup&gt; ''i''&lt;/sup&gt; i.e. with the four-vector tangent to the trajectory. Finally the condition ''g''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 is obviously satisfied, since the derivative −''dS''/''ds'' of the action along the trajectory is the mass of the particle, which was set equal to 1; therefore |''dS''/''ds''| = 1.

The gauge conditions {{EquationNote|eq. 15}} do not fix the coordinate system completely and therefore are not a fixed [[gauge theory|gauge]], as the spacelike hypersurface at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; can be chosen arbitrarily. One still have the freedom of performing some coordinate transformations containing four arbitrary functions depending on the three spatial variables ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;, which are easily worked out in infinitesimal form:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;x^i = \acute{x}^i + \xi^i(\acute{x}).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 18}}}}
Here, the collections of the four old coordinates (''t'', ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;) and four new coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\acute{t}, \acute{x}^{\alpha})&lt;/math&gt; are denoted by the symbols ''x'' and &lt;math&gt;\acute{x}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The functions &lt;math&gt;\xi^i(\acute{x})&lt;/math&gt; together with their first derivatives are infinitesimally small quantities. After such a transformation, the four-dimensional interval takes the form:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = g_{ik}(x)dx^i dx^k = g^{(new)}_{ik} (\acute{x})d\acute{x}^i d\acute{x}^k,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 19}}}}
where
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g^{(new)}_{ik} (\acute{x}) = g_{ik} (\acute{x}) + g_{il} (\acute{x}) \frac{\partial \xi^l (\acute{x})}{\partial \acute{x}^k} + g_{kl} (\acute{x}) \frac{\partial \xi^l (\acute{x})}{\partial \acute{x}^i} + \frac{\partial g_{ik} (\acute{x})}{\partial \acute{x}^l} \xi^l (\acute{x}).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 20}}}}
In the last formula, the &lt;math&gt;g_{ik}(\acute{x})&lt;/math&gt; are the same functions ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ik''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') in which ''x'' should simply be replaced by &lt;math&gt;\acute{x}&lt;/math&gt;. If one wishes to preserve the gauge {{EquationNote|eq. 15}} also for the new metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g^{(new)}_{ik} (\acute{x})&lt;/math&gt; in the new coordinates &lt;math&gt;\acute{x}&lt;/math&gt;, it is necessary to impose the following restrictions on the functions &lt;math&gt;\xi^i (\acute{x})&lt;/math&gt;:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \xi^0 (\acute{x})}{\partial \acute{x}} = 0, \quad g_{\alpha \beta} (\acute{x}) \frac{\partial \xi^{\beta} (\acute{x})}{\partial \acute{t}} - \frac{\partial \xi^0 (\acute{x})}{\partial \acute{x}^{\alpha}} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 21}}}}
The solutions of these equations are:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\xi^0 = f^0 \left (\acute{x}^1, \acute{x}^2, \acute{x}^3 \right ), \quad \xi^{\alpha} = \int{g^{\alpha \beta} (\acute{x}) \frac{\partial f^0 \left (\acute{x}^1, \acute{x}^2, \acute{x}^3 \right )}{\partial \acute{x}^{\beta}} d \acute{x}^0 } + f^{\alpha} \left (\acute{x}^1, \acute{x}^2, \acute{x}^3 \right ),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 22}}}}
where ''f''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; are four arbitrary functions depending only on the spatial coordinates &lt;math&gt;\acute{x}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a more elementary geometrical explanation, consider Fig. 2. First, the synchronous time line ξ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t'' can be chosen arbitrarily (Bob's, Carol's, Dana's or any of an infinitely many observers). This makes one arbitrarily chosen function: &lt;math&gt;\xi^0 = f^0 \left (\acute{x}^1, \acute{x}^2, \acute{x}^3 \right )&lt;/math&gt;. Second, the initial hypersurface can be chosen in infinitely many ways. Each of these choices changes three functions: one function for each of the three spatial coordinates &lt;math&gt;\xi^{\alpha} = f^{\alpha} \left (\acute{x}^1, \acute{x}^2, \acute{x}^3 \right )&lt;/math&gt;. Altogether, four (= 1 + 3) functions are arbitrary.

When discussing general solutions ''g''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt; of the field equations in synchronous gauges, it is necessary to keep in mind that the gravitational potentials ''g''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt; contain, among all possible arbitrary functional parameters present in them, four arbitrary functions of 3-space just representing the gauge freedom and therefore of no direct physical significance.

Another problem with the reference system is that [[caustic (optics)|caustic]]s can occur which cause the gauge choice to break down. These problems have caused some difficulties doing [[cosmological perturbation theory]] in this system, but the problems are now well understood. Synchronous coordinates are generally considered the most efficient reference system for doing calculations, and are used in many modern cosmology codes, such as [[CMBFAST]]. They are also useful for solving theoretical problems in which a spacelike hypersurface needs to be fixed, as with spacelike [[gravitational singularity|singularities]].

==Einstein equations in synchronous frame==
Introduction of a synchronous frame allows one to separate the operations of space and time differentiation in the [[Einstein field equations]]. To make them more concise, the notation
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha \beta} = \frac{\partial \gamma_{\alpha \beta}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 23}}}}
is introduced for the time derivatives of the three-dimensional metric tensor; these quantities also form a three-dimensional tensor. In the synchronous frame &lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the [[second fundamental form]] (shape tensor). All operations of shifting indices and covariant differentiation of the tensor &lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; are done in three-dimensional space with the metric γ&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;. This does not apply to operations of shifting indices in the space components of the four-tensors ''R&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;''. Thus ''T''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt; must be understood to be ''g''&lt;sup&gt;βγ&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;γα&lt;/sub&gt; + ''g''&lt;sup&gt;β0&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;0α&lt;/sub&gt;, which reduces to ''g''&lt;sup&gt;βγ&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;γα&lt;/sub&gt; and differs in sign from γ&lt;sup&gt;βγ&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;γα&lt;/sub&gt;. The sum &lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the logarithmic derivative of the determinant γ ≡ |γ&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;| = − ''g'':
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha}^{\alpha} = \gamma^{\alpha \beta} \frac{\partial \gamma_{\alpha \beta}}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \ln{(\gamma)}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 24}}}}
Then for the complete set of [[Christoffel symbols]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{kl}^i&lt;/math&gt; one obtains:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{00}^{0} = \Gamma_{00}^{\alpha} = \Gamma_{0 \alpha}^0 = 0, \quad \Gamma_{\alpha \beta}^0 = \frac{1}{2} \varkappa_{\alpha \beta}, \quad \Gamma_{0 \beta}^{\alpha} = \frac{1}{2} \varkappa_{\beta}^{\alpha}, \quad \Gamma_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma} = \lambda_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 25}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; are the three-dimensional Christoffel symbols constructed from γ&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma} = \frac{1}{2} \gamma^{\gamma \mu} \left ( \gamma_{\mu \alpha,\beta} + \gamma_{\mu \beta,\beta} - \gamma_{\alpha \beta,\mu} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 26}}}}
where the comma denotes partial derivative by the respective coordinate.

With the Christoffel symbols {{EquationNote|eq. 25}}, the components ''R&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g&lt;sup&gt;il&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;lk&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the [[Ricci tensor]] can be written in the form:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_0^0=-\frac{1}{2} \dot{\varkappa}-\frac{1}{4} \varkappa_{\alpha}^{\beta} \varkappa_{\beta}^{\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 27}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha}^{0}=\frac{1}{2} \left (\varkappa_{\alpha;\beta}^{\beta} - \varkappa_{,\alpha} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 28}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha}^{\beta}=-\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\gamma}} \dot{\left (\sqrt{\gamma} \varkappa_{\alpha}^{\beta} \right )} - P_{\alpha}^{\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 29}}}}
Dots on top denote time differentiation, semicolons (";") denote covariant differentiation which in this case is performed with respect to the three-dimensional metric γ&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt; with three-dimensional Christoffel symbols &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varkappa \equiv \varkappa_{\alpha}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt; is a three-dimensional Ricci tensor constructed from &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P_{\alpha}^{\beta} = \gamma^{\beta \gamma} P_{\gamma \alpha}, \quad P_{\alpha \beta} = \lambda_{\alpha \beta, \gamma}^{\gamma} - \lambda_{\gamma \alpha, \beta}^{\gamma} + \lambda_{\alpha \beta}^{\gamma} \lambda_{\gamma \mu}^{\mu} - \lambda_{\alpha \mu}^{\gamma} \lambda_{\beta \gamma}^{\mu}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 30}}}}
It follows from {{EquationNote|eq. 27–29}} that the Einstein equations &lt;math&gt;R_i^k = 8 \pi k \left ( T_i^k - \frac{1}{2} \delta_i^k T \right )&lt;/math&gt; (with the components of the energy-momentum tensor ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = −''T''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = −''T''&lt;sub&gt;0α&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt; = γ&lt;sup&gt;βγ&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;γα&lt;/sub&gt;) become in a synchronous coordinate system:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_0^0=-\frac{1}{2} \dot{\varkappa}-\frac{1}{4} \varkappa_{\alpha}^{\beta} \varkappa_{\beta}^{\alpha} = 8 \pi k \left ( T_0^0 - \frac{1}{2} T \right ),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 31}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha}^{0}=\frac{1}{2} \left (\varkappa_{\alpha;\beta}^{\beta} - \varkappa_{,\alpha} \right ) = 8 \pi k T_{\alpha}^0,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 32}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha}^{\beta}=-\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\gamma}} \dot{\left (\sqrt{\gamma} \varkappa_{\alpha}^{\beta} \right )} - P_{\alpha}^{\beta} = 8 \pi k \left ( T_{\alpha}^{\beta} - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{\alpha}^{\beta} T \right ).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 33}}}}
A characteristic feature of synchronous reference systems is that they are not stationary: the [[gravitational field]] cannot be constant in such a system. In a constant field &lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; would become zero. But in the presence of matter the disappearance of all &lt;math&gt;\varkappa_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; would contradict {{EquationNote|eq. 31}} (which has a right side different from zero). In empty space from {{EquationNote|eq. 33}} follows that all ''P''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;, and with them all the components of the three-dimensional curvature tensor ''P''&lt;sub&gt;αβγδ&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Riemann tensor]]) vanish, i.e. the field vanishes entirely (in a synchronous system with a [[Euclidean metric|Euclidean spatial metric]] the space-time is flat).

At the same time the matter filling the space cannot in general be at rest relative to the synchronous reference frame. This is obvious from the fact that particles of matter within which there are pressures generally move along lines that are not geodesics; the [[world line]] of a particle at rest is a time line, and thus is a geodesic in the synchronous reference system. An exception is the case of dust (''p'' = 0). Here the particles interacting with one another will move along geodesic lines; consequently, in this case the condition for a synchronous reference system does not contradict the condition that it be comoving with the matter. Even in this case, in order to be able to choose a synchronously comoving system of reference, it is still necessary that the matter move without rotation. In the comoving system the contravariant components of the velocity are ''u''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, ''u''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; = 0. If the reference system is also synchronous, the covariant components must satisfy ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, so that its four-dimensional [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] must vanish:
:&lt;math&gt;u_{i;k} - u_{k;i} \equiv \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x^k} - \frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x^i} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
But this tensor equation must then also be valid in any other reference frame. Thus, in a synchronous but not comoving system the condition curl '''v''' = 0 for the three-dimensional velocity '''v''' is additionally needed. For other [[equations of state]] a similar situation can occur only in special cases when the pressure gradient vanishes in all or in certain directions.

In [[model theory]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''type''' is an object that, loosely speaking, describes how a (real or possible) element or elements in a [[structure (mathematical logic)|mathematical structure]] might behave.  More precisely, it is a set of [[First-order logic|first-order]] formulas in a language ''L'' with free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; that are true of a sequence of elements of an ''L''-structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.  Depending on the context, types can be '''complete''' or '''partial''' and they may use a fixed set of constants, ''A'', from the structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.  The question of which types represent actual elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; leads to the ideas of [[saturated model]]s and '''omitting types'''.

==Formal definition==
Consider a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; for a [[Formal language|language]] ''L''.  Let ''M'' be the [[Structure (mathematical logic)#Domain|universe]] of the structure. For every ''A''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''M'', let ''L''(''A'') be the language obtained from ''L'' by adding a constant ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''a''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A''. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;L(A) = L \cup \{c_a : a \in A\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''1-type (of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;) over''' ''A'' is a set ''p''(''x'') of formulas in ''L''(''A'') with at most one free variable ''x'' (therefore 1-type) such that for every finite subset ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''p''(''x'') there is some ''b''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M'', depending on ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), with &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \models p_0(b) &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. all formulas in ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are true in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; when ''x'' is replaced by ''b'').

Similarly an '''''n''-type (of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;) over''' ''A'' is defined to be a set ''p''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''('''''x''''') of formulas in ''L''(''A''), each having its free variables occurring only among the given ''n'' free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, such that for every finite subset ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''''x''''')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''p''('''''x''''') there are some elements ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M'' with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\models p_0(b_1,\ldots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Complete type''' refers to those types that are [[maximal consistent set|maximal]] with respect to inclusion, i.e. if ''p''('''''x''''') is a complete type, then for every &lt;math&gt;\phi(\boldsymbol{x}) \in L(A,\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt; either &lt;math&gt; \phi(\boldsymbol{x}) \in p(\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt;  or  &lt;math&gt;\lnot\phi(\boldsymbol{x}) \in p(\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt;. Any non-complete type is called a '''partial type'''. 
So, the word '''type''' in general refers to any ''n''-type, partial or complete, over any chosen set of parameters (possibly the empty set).

An ''n''-type ''p''('''''x''''') is said to be {{anchor|realizationOfTypes}}'''realized in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;''' if there is an element '''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\models p(\boldsymbol{b})&lt;/math&gt;. The existence of such a realization is guaranteed for any type by the [[Compactness theorem]], although the realization might take place in some [[elementary extension]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, rather than in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; itself. 
If a complete type is realized by '''''b''''' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, then the type is typically denoted &lt;math&gt;tp_n^{\mathcal{M}}(\boldsymbol{b}/A)&lt;/math&gt; and referred to as '''the complete type of ''b'' over''' ''A''.

A type ''p''('''''x''''') is said to be '''isolated by ''φ''''', for &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in p(x)&lt;/math&gt;, if  &lt;math&gt;\forall \psi(\boldsymbol{x}) \in p(\boldsymbol{x}), \varphi(\boldsymbol{x}) \rightarrow \psi(\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt;. Since finite subsets of a type are always realized in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, there is always an element '''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''φ''('''''b''''') is true in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;; i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \models \varphi(\boldsymbol{b})&lt;/math&gt;, thus '''''b''''' realizes the entire isolated type. So isolated types will be realized in every elementary substructure or extension. Because of this, isolated types can never be omitted (see below).

A model that realizes the maximum possible variety of types is called a [[saturated model]], and the [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]] construction provides one way of producing saturated models.

==Examples of types==
Consider the language with one binary connective, which we denote as &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be the structure &lt;math&gt;\langle \omega, \in_{\omega}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for this language, which is the ordinal &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; with its standard well-ordering. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; denote the theory of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider the set of formulas &lt;math&gt;p(x):=\{ n\in_{\omega} x \mid n \in \omega\} &lt;/math&gt;. First, we claim this is a type. Let &lt;math&gt;p_0(x)\subseteq p(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a finite subset of &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;. We need to find an &lt;math&gt;b\in\omega&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies all the formulas in &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;. Well, we can just take the successor of the largest ordinal mentioned in the set of formulas &lt;math&gt;p_0(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then this will clearly contain all the ordinals mentioned in &lt;math&gt;p_0(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have that &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a type. 
Next, note that &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not realized in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. For, if it were there would be some &lt;math&gt;n\in\omega&lt;/math&gt; that contains every element of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. 
If we wanted to realize the type, we might be tempted to consider the model &lt;math&gt;\langle \omega+1,\in_{\omega+1}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, which is indeed a supermodel of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; that realizes the type. Unfortunately, this extension is not elementary, that is this model does not have to satisfy &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the sentence &lt;math&gt;\exists x \forall y (y\in x \lor y=x)&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied by this model and not by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

So, we wish to realize the type in an elementary extension. We can do this by defining a new structure in this language, which we will denote &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}'&lt;/math&gt;. The domain of the structure will be &lt;math&gt;\omega \cup \mathbb{Z}'&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}'&lt;/math&gt; is the set of integers adorned in such a way that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}'\cap\omega=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; denote the usual order of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}'&lt;/math&gt;. We interpret the symbol &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; in our new structure by &lt;math&gt;\in_{\mathcal{M}'} = \in_{\omega} \cup &lt; \cup \,(\omega \times \mathbb{Z}')&lt;/math&gt;. The idea being that we are adding a "Z-chain", or copy of the integers, above all the finite ordinals. Clearly any element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}'&lt;/math&gt; realizes the type &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, one can verify that this extension is elementary.

Another example: the complete type of the number 2 over the emptyset, considered as a member of the natural numbers, would be the set of all first-order statements describing a variable ''x'' that are true for ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. This set would include formulas such as &lt;math&gt;\,\!x\ne 1+1+1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\le 1+1+1+1+1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\exists y(y&lt;x)&lt;/math&gt;. This is an example of an isolated type, since the formula &lt;math&gt;x = 1+1&lt;/math&gt; implies all other formulas that are true about the number 2.

For example, the statements

:&lt;math&gt;\forall y(y^2&lt;2 \implies y&lt;x)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\forall y((y&gt;0 \land y^2&gt;2) \implies y&gt;x)&lt;/math&gt;

describing the [[square root of 2]] are consistent with the axioms of [[ordered field]]s, and can be extended to a complete type. This type is not realized in the ordered field of rational numbers, but is realized in the ordered field of reals. Similarly, the infinite set of formulas (over the emptyset) {x&gt;1, x&gt;1+1, x&gt;1+1+1, ...} is not realized in the ordered field of real numbers, but is realized in the ordered field of [[hyperreals]]. If we allow more parameters, for instance all of the reals, we can specify a type &lt;math&gt;\{ 0 &lt; x &lt; r : r \in \mathbb{R} \}&lt;/math&gt; that is realized by an [[infinitesimal]] hyperreal that violates the [[Archimedean property]].

The reason it is useful to restrict the parameters to a certain subset of the model is that it helps to distinguish the types that can be satisfied from those that cannot. For example, using the entire set of real numbers as parameters one could generate an uncountably infinite set of formulas like &lt;math&gt;x\ne 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\ne \pi&lt;/math&gt;, ... that would explicitly rule out every possible real value for ''x'', and therefore could never be realized within the real numbers.

==Stone spaces==

It is useful to consider the set of complete ''n''-types over ''A'' as a [[topological space]]. Consider the following equivalence relation on formulae in the free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with parameters in ''M'':
:&lt;math&gt;\psi \equiv \phi \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{M} \models \forall x_1,\ldots,x_n (\psi(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \leftrightarrow \phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)).&lt;/math&gt;
One can show that &lt;math&gt;\psi \equiv \phi&lt;/math&gt; iff they are contained in exactly the same complete types.

The set of formulae in free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; over ''A'' up to this equivalence relation is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] (and is canonically isomorphic to the set of ''A''-definable subsets of ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;). The complete ''n''-types correspond to [[ultrafilter]]s of this boolean algebra. The set of complete ''n''-types can be made into a topological space by taking the sets of types containing a given formula as basic open sets. This constructs the [[Stone space]], which is [[compact space|compact]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]].

'''Example'''. The complete theory of [[algebraically closed field]]s of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0 has [[quantifier elimination]], which allows one to show that the possible complete 1-types correspond to:
*[[root of a function|Root]]s of a given [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible non-constant polynomial]] over the rationals with leading coefficient 1. For example, the type of square roots of 2. Each of these types is an open point of the Stone space.
*Transcendental elements, that are not roots of any non-zero polynomial. This type is a point in the Stone space that is closed but not open.
In other words, the 1-types correspond exactly to the prime ideals of the polynomial ring '''Q'''[''x''] over the rationals '''Q''': if ''r'' is an element of the model of type ''p'', then the ideal corresponding to ''p'' is the set of polynomials with ''r'' as a root. More generally, the complete ''n''-types correspond to the prime ideals of the polynomial ring '''Q'''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], in other words to the points of the [[prime spectrum]] of this ring. (The Stone space topology can in fact be viewed as the Zariski topology of a Boolean ring induced in a natural way from the lattice structure of the Boolean Algebra; while the Zariski topology is not in general Hausdorff, it is in the case of Boolean rings.) For example, if ''q''(''x'',''y'') is an irreducible polynomial in 2 variables, there is a 2-type whose realizations are (informally) pairs (''x'',''y'') of transcendental elements with ''q''(''x'',''y'')=0.

==The omitting types theorem==

Given a complete ''n''-type ''p'' one can ask if there is a model of the theory that '''omits''' ''p'', in other words there is no ''n''-tuple in the model that realizes ''p''. 
If ''p'' is an [[isolated point]] in the Stone space, i.e. if {''p''} is an open set, it is easy to see that every model realizes ''p'' (at least if the theory is complete). The '''omitting types theorem''' says that conversely if ''p'' is not isolated then there is a countable model omitting ''p'' (provided that the language is countable).

'''Example''': In the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0, there is a 1-type represented by elements that are transcendental over the prime field. This is a non-isolated point of the Stone space (in fact, the only non-isolated point). The field of algebraic numbers is a model omitting this type, and the algebraic closure of any 
transcendental extension of the rationals is a model realizing this type.

All the other types are "algebraic numbers" (more precisely, they are the sets of first order statements satisfied by some given algebraic number), and all such types are realized in all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0.

'''Voluntarism''', sometimes referred to as '''voluntary action''', is the principle that individuals are free to choose goals and how to achieve them within the bounds of certain societal and cultural constraints, as opposed to actions that are coerced or [[predetermined]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|chapter=Chapter Four: Talcott Parsons and Robert Merton, Functionalism and Modernization|title=Introduction to Sociological Theory: Theorists, Concepts, and their Applicability to the Twenty-First Century|last=Dillon|first=Michele|publisher=Wiley|orig-year=2009|year=2013|isbn=9781118471906|page=161, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volunteerism==
Volunteer management specialist Susan Ellis differentiates between "voluntarism" and "[[volunteerism]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Voluntarism" (the older term) refers to everything voluntary. In the United States this includes religion. It certainly encompasses the entire "[[voluntary sector]]," but "voluntary" in the "voluntarism" context means not mandated by law (as government is). Many voluntary sector (nonprofit) agencies have a volunteer board because that is a legal requirement, but may not utilize volunteers in direct service in any way. There are subjects within "voluntarism" that have nothing to do with volunteers, such as [[Unrelated Business Income Tax]] legislation, proposal writing, and compensation law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan J. Ellis |title=Volunt/ar/eer/ism: What's the Difference? |url=https://www.energizeinc.com/tips/voluntareerism-whats-difference |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030822/https://www.energizeinc.com/tips/voluntareerism-whats-difference |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Voluntary provision of services to religious, civil, medical, educational, environmental and other private or governmental organizations doubtless has a long history. Such volunteer efforts keep expenses down for non-profit and philanthropic organizations, empower individuals and groups to help others, and make volunteers feel needed.&lt;ref name="Perkins"&gt;{{cite web |author=Susan Perkins |url=http://www.learningtogive.org/papers/paper67.html |title=Voluntarism |publisher=Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism flourished in the 19th and early 20th centuries and was empowering especially to the women who had been excluded from political participation outside the home. Women’s organizations dealt with social problems created by rapid industrialization and urbanization, and by massive immigration which were not addressed by institutions of the time and had a great influence on American political culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kathryn Kish Sklar |url=http://www.puaf.umd.edu/IPPP/summer98/quckened_conscience.htm |date=1998 |title=The "Quickened Conscience"], |publisher=Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy, [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806053219/http://www.puaf.umd.edu/IPPP/summer98/quckened_conscience.htm |archivedate=August 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism has been a phrase used in labor relations.  In Britain, it means the state refrains from directly intervening in industrial relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/UNITED%20KINGDOM/VOLUNTARISM-EN.htm |title=United Kingdom, Voluntarism |publisher=Eurofound |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early American labor movement it meant trade unions should focus on "pure and simple" gains in wages and working conditions and not independent labor politics and [[industrial unionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Brian Robertson |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=38781 |title=Voluntarism Against the Open Shop: Labor and Business Strategies in the Battle for American Labor Markets] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |journal=Studies in American Political Development |date=April 1999 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=146–85 |accessdate=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Willful Liberalism: Voluntarism and Individuality in Political Theory and Practice'', [[Johns Hopkins University]] political science professor [[Richard E. Flathman]] argues that liberals must understand more about individuality and self-reliance and self-responsibility and therefore be more open of acceptance of voluntary action and less concerned with ordering political society. He notes, "Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all dispositions constantly form associations," which he describes as "of a thousand other kinds, religious, moral, serious, futile, general or restricted, enormous or diminutive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard E. Flathman |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xvqIeEeVSyIC&amp;dq=voluntarism&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP3,M1 |title=Willful Liberalism: Voluntarism and Individuality in Political Theory and Practice |publisher=[[Cornell University Press#press|Cornell University Press]] |year=1992 |page=76 |isbn=9780801499555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], voluntarism is an important aspect of the [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]], as well as other theories of [[social action]] and [[agency (sociology)|agency]].

[[Voluntaryism|Voluntaryists]], [[free market]] advocates, [[libertarians]] and [[anarchists]] call for voluntary efforts to replace most or all government efforts, using both moral and utilitarian arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David T.

Voluntary provision of services to the religious, civil, medical, educational, environmental and other private or governmental organizations doubtless has a long history.
* [[William Penn]], who established the Quakers in the late 17th century, preached taking responsibility for others and improving the world.
* [[Cotton Mather]], who lived during the colonial period, encouraged the formation of associations and causes.
* [[Benjamin Franklin]] organized a voluntary militia in Quaker-controlled Pennsylvania, whose pacifist legislature refused to support the American revolutionary war.
* [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] noted the unusually large number of voluntary associations in America.
* The [[Underground Railroad]] was a network of volunteers who helped slaves escape from their captors in the South.
* [[Dorothea Dix]], a nurse, recruited and trained other women as nurses during the Civil War.
* [[Clara Barton]] also served as a Civil War nurse and went on to establish the American Red Cross in 1881 for relief of natural disasters, such as earthquakes.
* [[Jane Addams]] opened a settlement house in 1889 to teach volunteers how to help the poor improve their lives.
* In 1995, 93 million Americans volunteered an average of 4.3 hours per week.&lt;ref name="Perkins"/&gt;

The '''will to life''' or ''Wille zum Leben'' is a psychological force to fight for [[self-preservation]] seen as an important and active process of conscious and unconscious [[reasoning]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] is the first to give name to this force.

==Concept==
In psychology, the will to live is the [[Drive theory|drive]] for self-preservation, usually coupled with [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectations]] for future improvement in one's state in life.&lt;ref&gt;"Will to Live." McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. 2002. The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. 28 Nov. 2017 https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/will+to+live&lt;/ref&gt; The will to live is an important concept when attempting to understand and comprehend why we do what we do in order to stay alive, and for as long as we can. This can be related to either one's push for survival on the brink of death, or someone who is just trying to find a meaning to continuing their life. Some researchers say that people who have a reason or purpose in life during such dreadful and horrific experiences will often appear to fare better than those that may find such experiences overwhelming.&lt;ref&gt;Frankl, V. E. (1963). In Man's search for meaning. Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Everyday, people undergo countless types of negative experiences, some to which may be demoralizing, hurtful, or tragic. An ongoing question continues to be what keeps the will to live in these situations. Some people that claim to have experienced instances of the will to live, have many different explanations behind it.&lt;ref&gt;Grohol, J. (2009). The Power of the Will to Live. Psych Central. Retrieved on November 21, 2012, from http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/12/28/the-power-of-the-will-to-live&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The will to live is considered to be a very basic drive in humans; but not necessarily the main driving force. In [[psychotherapy]], [[Sigmund Freud]] termed the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]], which is the seeking of [[pleasure]] and avoiding of [[suffering|pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viktor Frankl]], after spending time in a German concentration camp, developed psychotherapy called [[logotherapy]], or the "will to meaning". [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] highlights the innate appetite that people possess for love and belonging but before all this there is the very basic and powerful will to live.
Psychologists have established that human beings are a goal-oriented species. In assessing the will to live, it should be borne in mind that it could be augmented or diminished by the relative strength of other simultaneously existent drives. Psychologists generally agree that there is the will to live, the will to pleasure, the will to superiority and the will to connection. There are also usually varying degrees of curiosity with regard to what may be termed the will to identity or establishing meaningful personal responses. The will to live is a platform without which it would not be possible to satisfy the other drives. However, this overlooks the possibility that there is a commonality among all creatures that drives all others urges. And that is the need to reproduce and ensure the preservation of the species.&lt;ref&gt;Oster, C. (). How Do We Define "The Will to Live".

== Similarity to self-preservation ==

Self-preservation is a behavior that ensures the survival of an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/self-preservation|title=Self-preservation - definition of self-preservation by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pain]] and [[fear]] are integral parts of this mechanism. Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future.&lt;ref name= Lynn1984&gt;{{vcite book | author = Lynn B | authorlink = | editor =  Winlow W, Holden AV | others = | title = The neurobiology of pain: Symposium of the Northern Neurobiology Group, held at Leeds on 18 April 1983 | edition = | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 1984 | pages = | isbn = 0-7190-0996-0 | page = 106 | chapter = Cutaneous nociceptors | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=S7rnAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;=true#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pain resolves promptly once the painful stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but sometimes pain persists despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body; and sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease.&lt;ref name="Raj_2007"&gt;{{vcite book | author = Raj PP | authorlink = | editor = Niv D, Kreitler S, Diego B, Lamberto A | others = | title = The Handbook of Chronic Pain | edition = | publisher = Nova Biomedical Books | location = | year = 2007 | pages = | isbn = 1-60021-044-9 | oclc = | chapter = Taxonomy and classification of pain | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG4Svh_UL3UC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear causes the organism to seek safety and may cause a release of [[adrenaline]],&lt;ref name=gleitman&gt;{{Cite book|author= [[Henry Gleitman]], [[Alan J. Fridlund]] and [[Daniel Reisberg]] |title= Psychology |edition= 6 |year= 2004 |publisher= [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]  |isbn= 0-393-97767-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/psychology/fear.html | work=CBC News | title=Fear factors | date=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has the effect of increased strength and heightened senses such as hearing, smell, and sight. Self-preservation may also be interpreted figuratively, in regard to the coping mechanisms one needs to prevent emotional trauma from distorting the mind (see: [[defence mechanism]].)

Even the most simple of living organisms (for example, the single-celled bacteria) are typically under intense selective pressure to evolve a response that would help avoid a damaging environment, if such an environment exists. Organisms also evolve while adapting - even thriving - in a benign environment (for example, a marine sponge modifies its structure in response to current changes, in order to better absorb and process nutrients). Self-preservation is therefore an almost universal hallmark of life. However, when introduced to a novel threat, many species will have a self-preservation response either too specialised, or not specialised enough, to cope with that particular threat.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} An example is the [[dodo]], which evolved in the absence of natural predators and hence lacked an appropriate, general self-preservation response to heavy predation by humans and rats, showing no fear of them.

==Correlations==
“Existential, psychiatric, social, and, to a lesser degree, physical variables are highly correlated with the will to live”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Hack | first2 = T. | last3 = Hassard | first3 = T. | last4 = Kristjanson | first4 = L. J. | last5 = McClement | first5 = S. | last6 = Harlos | first6 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Understanding the Will to Live in Patients Nearing Death | url = | journal = Psychosomatics | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 7–10 | doi=10.1176/appi.psy.46.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existential issues found to correlate significantly include hopelessness, the desire for death, sense of dignity, and burden to others. Psychiatric issues found to be strongly associated are such as depression, anxiety, and  lack of concentration. Physical issues that showed the strongest associations were appetite and appearance which did not show the same consistent degree of correlation. The four main predictor variables of the will to live changing over time are anxiety, shortness of breath, depression, and sense of well-being&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Tataryn | first2 = D. | last3 = Clinch | first3 = J. J. | last4 = Dudgeon | first4 = D. | year = 1999 | title = Will to Live in the Terminally Ill | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = 816–819 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(99)80011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which correlate with the other variable predictors as well.  Social variables and quality of life measures are shown to correlate significantly with the will to live such as support and satisfaction with support from family, friends, and health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Hack | first2 = T. | last3 = Hassard | first3 = T. | last4 = Kristjanson | first4 = L. J. | last5 = McClement | first5 = S. | last6 = Harlos | first6 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Understanding the Will to Live in Patients Nearing Death | url = | journal = Psychosomatics | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 7–10 | doi=10.1176/appi.psy.46.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings on the will to live have suggested that psychological variables are replaced by physical mediators of variation as death draws nearer. The will to live has also proven to be highly unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Tataryn | first2 = D. | last3 = Clinch | first3 = J. J. | last4 = Dudgeon | first4 = D. | year = 1999 | title = Will to Live in the Terminally Ill | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = 816–819 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(99)80011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Many studies have been conducted on the theory of the will to live.  Among these studies are subject to the difference in gender and the elderly and also in the terminally ill. One study focused on a simple question that asked about rating one’s will to live and presented the findings that elderly participants reporting a stronger will to live and strengthened or stable will to live survived longer in comparison to those with a weak will to live. This study found that women were able to cope with life-threatening situations, but suggested that the participants could not have been stable and requires future replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Hack | first2 = T. | last3 = Hassard | first3 = T. | last4 = Kristjanson | first4 = L. J. | last5 = McClement | first5 = S. | last6 = Harlos | first6 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Understanding the Will to Live in Patients Nearing Death | url = | journal = Psychosomatics | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 7–10 | doi=10.1176/appi.psy.46.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second study presented the idea of the will to live in the terminally ill specifically cancer patients termed as older. In this study researchers were able to suggest that patients who had tested as having a low sustained will to live died soonest, as opposed to having a moderate level of the will to live, lived the longest while high will to live could affect individuals in any direction. This study needs future replication that can show the effects of will to live in the terminally ill from different diseases and age categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tataryn | first1 = D. | last2 = Chochoniv | first2 = H. M. | year = 2002 | title = Predicting the trajectory of will to live in terminally ill patients | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033318202703642 | journal = Psychosomatics | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 370–377 | doi=10.1176/appi.psy.43.5.370}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other accounts of the will to live exist in many extreme medical cases, where patients have overcome extraordinary odds to survive. The Holocaust has provided many instances of this phenomenon, and is a good example of this as well.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg, J. Retrieved from http://www.councilforrelationships.org/resources/goldenberg-survival.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed mechanism for the will to live is the idea that positive mental thinking tends to lower one’s risk for disease and health complications. One study showed that women who thought positively were more likely to carry more antibodies against certain strains of the flu, thus having a stronger immune system than those who were told to think negative thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Goode, E. (2003, September 02). Power of positive thinking may have a health benefit, study says. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/02/health/power-of-positive-thinking-may-have-a-health-benefit-study-says.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Powerful examples of humans having a will to live can be seen in death records throughout history showing that people were more likely to die right after a major holiday, such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, and even birthdays, not actually on or before them, but passing shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;Shimizu, M. &amp; Pelham, B.W. (2008). Postponing a date with the Grim Reaper: Ceremonial events and mortality. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 30(1), 36-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grohol, J. (2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6210">The '''William James Lectures''' are a series of invited lectureships at [[Harvard University]] sponsored by the Departments of [[Philosophy]] and [[Psychology]], who alternate in the selection of speakers.  The series was created in honor of the American [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher and psychologist [[William James]], a former faculty member at that institution. It was endowed through a 1929 bequest from Edgar Pierce, a Harvard Alumnus, who also funded the prestigious Edgar Pierce Chair in Philosophy and Psychology.  Pierce stipulated that the delivered lectures be open to the public and subsequently published by the [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard Alumni Bulletin'', ''34'' (22), (Fri. March 4, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; The program was initiated in 1930 and has continued to the present. Its invited lecturers have included some of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. In some cases, the selection of lecturer has generated considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, R. (2001).  ''Bertrand Russell: The ghost of madness, 1921–1970.''
