The '''American juvenile justice system''' is the primary system used to handle youth who are convicted of criminal offenses.  The system is composed of a federal and many separate state, territorial, and local jurisdictions, with states and the federal government sharing sovereign police power under the common authority of the [[United States Constitution]]. The juvenile justice system intervenes in delinquent behavior through police, court, and correctional involvement, with the goal of rehabilitation. Youth and their guardians can face a variety of consequences including [[probation]], [[community service]], [[Juvenile court|youth court]], [[Youth incarceration in the United States|youth incarceration]] and [[alternative school]]ing. The juvenile justice system, similar to the adult system, operates from a belief that intervening early in delinquent behavior will deter adolescents from engaging in criminal behavior as adults.

==History and background==

===Pre-1900===

[[Juvenile delinquency]] punishments trace back to the Middle Ages when crimes were severely punished by the Church. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, few legal differences existed between children and adults.&lt;ref name="Columbia University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nybell|first1=Lynn M.|last2=Shook,|first2=Jeffrey J.|last3=editors|first3=Janet L. Finn,|title=Childhood, youth, and social work in transformation : implications for policy and practice|date=2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231141406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=edited by Jim Goddard, Sally McNamee, Adrian James, Allison|title=The politics of childhood : international perspectives, contemporary developments|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=9781403935519}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children as young as six and seven years were considered productive members of the family and their labor contributed to family income. In court, children as young as seven were treated as adults and could receive the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Columbia University Press"/&gt; Early debates questioned whether there should be a separate legal system for punishing juveniles, or if juveniles should be sentenced in the same manner as adults&lt;ref name=Finley&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finley|first1=Laura L.|title=Juvenile Justice|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the changing demographic, social, and economic context of the 19th century resulting largely from industrialization,  "the social construction of childhood...as a period of dependency and exclusion from the adult world" was institutionalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coupet|first1=Sascha|title=What to do with a Wolf in Sheep's Clothing|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=148|pages=1310–1311}}&lt;/ref&gt; This century saw the opening of the first programs targeting juvenile delinquency. Barry Krisberg and James F. Austin note that the first ever institution dedicated to juvenile delinquency was the New York House of Refuge in 1825.&lt;ref name = Zimring&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zimring|first1=Franklin E.|last2=Tanenhaus|first2=David S.|title=Choosing the Future for American Juvenile Justice|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other programs, described by Finley, included: "houses of refuge", which emphasized moral rehabilitation; "reform schools", which had widespread reputations for mistreatment of the children living there; and "child saving organizations", social charity agencies dedicated to reforming poor and delinquent children.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; These 'child-saving efforts' were early attempts at  differentiating between delinquents and abandoned youth.

Prior to this ideological shift, the application of [[Parens patriae|parens patrea]] was restricted to protecting the interests of children, deciding guardianship and commitment of the mentally ill. In the 1839 landmark case Ex parte Crouse, the court allowed use of parens patrea to detain young people for non-criminal acts in the name of rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coupet|first1=Sascha|title=What to do with a Wolf in Sheep's Clothing|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=148|pages=1303–1346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kole|first1=T.|title=Recent developments: Juvenile offenders|journal=Harvard Journal on Legislation|volume=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since these decisions were carried out "in the best interest of the child," the due process protections afforded adult criminals were not extended to juveniles.

===Early 1900s===

The nation's first juvenile court was formed in Illinois in 1899 and provided a legal distinction between juvenile abandonment and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coupet|first1=Sascha|title=What to do with a Wolf in Sheep's Clothing|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=148|page=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law that established the court, the Illinois Juvenile Court Law of 1899, was created largely because of the advocacy of women such as [[Jane Addams]], [[Louise DeKoven Bowen]], [[Lucy Flower]] and [[Julia Lathrop]], who were members of the influential [[Chicago Woman's Club]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/306.html|title=Clubs, Women's|last=Knupfer|first=Anne Meis|date=2005|website=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=The Newberry Library|access-date=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8476140//|title=Woman's Club Deeds Will Not Be Forgotten|last=Granger|first=Bill|date=1 November 1999|work=The Daily Herald|access-date=21 January 2017|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago]] court opened on July 1, 1899 with Judge Tuthill presiding, along with several members of the Chicago Woman's Club who acted as advisors about the juvenile offender's backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcEShGLoIXEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22%20Mothers%20of%20All%20Children%3A%20Women%20Reformers%20and%20the%20Rise%20of%20Juvenile%20Courts%20in%20Progressive%20Era%20America%22&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chicago%20woman's%20club%22&amp;f=false|title=Mothers of All Children: Women Reformers and the Rise of Juvenile Courts in Progressive Era America|last=Clapp|first=Elizabeth Jane|publisher=Pennsylvania State Press|year=1998|isbn=0271017775|location=University Park, Pennsylvania|pages=19|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing a juvenile court helped reframe cultural and legal interpretations of "the best interests of the child."  "The underlying assumption of the original juvenile system, and one that continues to prevail, was that juveniles were generally more amenable to rehabilitation than adult criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coupet|first1=Sascha|title=What to do with a Wolf in Sheep's Clothing|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=148|page=1313}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new application of parens patrea and the development of a separate juvenile court formed the foundation for the modern juvenile justice system.

===1960s to 1980s===

Debate about morality and effectiveness surrounded juvenile courts until the 1950s. The 1960s through the 1980s saw a rise in attention to and speculation about juvenile delinquency, as well as concern about the court system as a social issue. This era was characterized by distinctly harsh punishments for youths.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; There was also a new focus on providing minors with due process and legal counsel in court. Criticism in this era focused on racial discrimination, gender disparities, and discrimination towards children with mental health problems or learning disabilities.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt;
While still recommending harsher punishments for serious crimes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartusch|first1=James W. Burfeind, Dawn Jeglum|title=Juvenile delinquency : an integrated approach|date=2011|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=0763758108|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; "community-based programs, diversion, and deinstitutionalization became the banners of juvenile justice policy in the 1970's".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sickmund|first1=Melissa|last2=Snyder|first2=H.|title=Juvenile Offenders and Victims: 1999 National Report|journal=Juvenile Offenders and Victims: 1999 National Report|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these alternative approaches were short lived. The rising crime rates of the 1960s and media misrepresentation of this crime throughout the 1970s and 80s, paved the way for Reagan's War on Drugs and subsequent "tough-on-crime" policies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Michelle|title=The new Jim Crow : mass incarceration in the age of colorblindness|date=2012|publisher=New Press|location=New York|isbn=9781595586438|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heightened fears of a 'youth problem' "revealed white, middle- and upper-class anxieties about growing social unrest and the potential volatility stemming from social and economic inequality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nybell|first1=Lynn M.|last2=Shook,|first2=Jeffrey J.|last3=editors|first3=Janet L. Finn,|title=Childhood, youth, and social work in transformation : implications for policy and practice|date=2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231141406|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public perception of juvenile deviance was such that at the 1999 Juvenile Justice Hearings, Bill McCollum claimed "simply and sadly put: Today in America no population poses a larger threat to public safety than juvenile offenders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mcollum|first1=Bill|title=H.R. 1501 (106th): Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hr1501}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, the United States experienced a large increase in crime, and juvenile crime was brought into public view ([[Juvenile delinquency in the United States]]). Americans feared a "juvenile super-predator", and this fear was met by the government with harsher policies for juvenile crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butts|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Travis|first2=Jeremy|title=The Rise and Fall of American Youth Violence|journal=The Urban Institute Justice Policy Center|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s to present day===

In the 1990s, juvenile crime – especially violent crime – decreased, although policies remained the same.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; Schools and politicians adopted zero tolerance policies with regard to crime, and argued that rehabilitative approaches were less effective than strict punishment.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt;
The increased ease in trying juveniles as adults became a defining feature of "tough-on-crime" policies in the 1990s. As Loyola law professor Sacha Coupet argues, "[o]ne way in which "get tough" advocates have supported a merger between the adult criminal and juvenile systems is by expanding the scope of transfer provisions or waivers that bring children under the jurisdiction of the adult criminal system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coupet|first1=Sascha|title=What to do with a Wolf in Sheep's Clothing|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=148|page=1318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states moved specific classes of crimes from the juvenile court to adult criminal court while others gave this power to judges or prosecutors on a case-by-case basis. Still others require the courts to treat offending youth like adults, but within the juvenile system. In some states, adjudicated offenders face mandatory sentences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; By 1997, all but three states had passed a combination of laws that eased use of transfer provisions, provided courts with expanded sentencing options and removed the confidentiality tradition of the juvenile court.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  
Juvenile courts were transformed to more easily allow for prosecution of juveniles as adults at the same time the adult system was re-defining which acts constituted a "serious crime." The "three strikes laws" that began in 1993 fundamentally altered the criminal offenses that resulted in detention, imprisonment and even a life sentence, for both youth and adults.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; "Three strikes laws" were not specific to juvenile offenders, but they were enacted during a period when the lines between juvenile and adult court were becoming increasingly blurred. The War on Drugs and "tough-on-crime" policies like Three Strikes resulted in an explosion in the number of incarcerated individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Tolerance and Alternative Strategies: A Fact Sheet for Educators and Policymakers|url=http://nasponline.org|website=National Association of School Psychologists Online|publisher=National Association of School Psychologists|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementation of the  Gun Free School Act (GFSA) in 1994 is one example of a "tough on crime" policy that has contributed to increased numbers of young people being arrested and detained.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Aaron|title=Tracing the School-to-Prison Pipeline from Zero-Tolerance Policies to Juvenile Justice Dispositions|journal=Georgetown Law Journal|date=2014|volume=102|page=1254}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to prosecute young offenders for serious crimes like gun possession on school property, but many states interpreted this law to include less dangerous weapons and drug possession.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Many schools even interpreted GFSA to include "infractions that pose no safety concern, such as 'disobeying [school] rules, 'insubordination,' and 'disruption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nybell|first1=Lynn M.|last2=Shook,|first2=Jeffrey J.|last3=editors|first3=Janet L. Finn,|title=Childhood, youth, and social work in transformation : implications for policy and practice|date=2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231141406|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; These offenses can now warrant suspension, expulsion and involvement with juvenile justice courts.&lt;ref name="Zimring"/&gt; Schools have become the primary stage for juvenile arrest and the charges brought against them and punishments they face are increasing in severity. Today this is frequently referred to as the [[School to prison pipeline]].

==Demographics==

Demographic information for youth involved in the Juvenile Justice system is somewhat difficult to collect, as most data is collected at state, county, and city levels.  Although the office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention publishes national numbers that breakdown the racial make-up of youth involved in the juvenile justice system, this data provides an incomplete picture, as it excludes Hispanic youth in its demographic calculations.

[[File:Demographics of Youth in America.png|thumb|A demographic breakdown of youth in the United States.]]

[[File:Youth Involved in Juvenile Court.png|thumb|A demographic breakdown of youth involved in juvenile court in the United States.]]

According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, in 2011 there were a total of 1,236,200 cases handled by the juvenile courts. 891,100 cases dealt with males, compared with 345,100 for females. The most prominent age group represented in the courts is 13 to 15 years, which make up 552,000 of the total cases. 410,900 of the cases involved Black adolescents, which represents about one-third of the total court cases.&lt;ref name = Sickmund&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sickmund|first1=M.|last2=Sladky|first2=A.|last3=Kang|first3=W.|title=Easy Access to Juvenile Court Statistics: 1985-2011|journal=National Center for Juvenile Justice|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of cases handled by the juvenile courts in the United States was 1,159,000 in 1985, and increased steadily until 1998, reaching a high point of 1,872,700. After this point, the number of cases steadily declined until 2011.&lt;ref name=Sickmund /&gt;

In the 1,236,200 cases settled in 2011, 60% of the juveniles had a previous background of criminal history in their families and 96% of the juveniles had substance abuse problems, often related to parental/guardian substance abuse. In 1999, juveniles accounted for 16% of all violent crime arrests, and 32% of all property crime. They also accounted for 54% of all arson arrests, 42% of vandalism arrests, 31% of larceny-theft arrests, and 33% of burglary arrests.&lt;ref&gt;Listenbee, Robert, Eric Holder, and Karol Mason. OJJDP Annual Report. Washington, DC, 2013. Print. http://www.ojjdp.gov/pubs/241584.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Racial discrepancies'''

Since 1995, the rate of confinement has dropped by 41%, and the rate has decreased among all major racial groups in the US. However, disparities by race remain apparent: in 2010, 225 youths per 100,000 were in confinement. When separated by race, there were 605 African-Americans, 127 Non-Hispanic Whites, 229 Hispanics, 367 Native Americans, and 47 Asian/Pacific Islanders in confinement per 100,000. African-Americans are close to five times more likely to be confined than white youths, while Latino and Native Americans are two to three times more likely to be confined than white youths.&lt;ref name=AECF /&gt; Racial disparities in confinement are relatively constant across states.

According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, females constitute 14% of juveniles in residential placement in 2011. Of these females, 61% belong to racial minority groups.&lt;ref name=OJJDP /&gt;

The [http://www.aecf.org/resources/youth-incarceration-in-the-united-states/ Annie E. Casey Foundation] provides additional information about the demographics of the juvenile justice system.

===Juveniles in residential placement===

Residential placement refers to any facility in which an adolescent remains on-site 24 hours a day. These facilities include detention centers, group homes, shelters, correctional facilities, or reform schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sickmund|first1=Melissa|title=Juveniles in Residential Placement, 1997-2008|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/229379.pdf|website=Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to census data of Juveniles in residential placement and the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the number of youths in juvenile detention centers in the United States has declined in the past two decades.&lt;ref name=AECF&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Incarceration in the United States|url=http://www.aecf.org/m/resourcedoc/aecf-YouthIncarcerationInfographic-2013.pdf|website=aecf.org|publisher=Annie E. Casey Foundation|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of adolescents incarcerated peaked in 1995, with 107,637 in confinement in a single day. In contrast, there were fewer than 62,000 adolescents in residential placement in October 2011.&lt;ref name=OJJDP&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Juveniles In Corrections|url=http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/corrections/faqs.asp|website=Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile offenders are placed either in public facilities operated by the State or local government, or private, for-profit facilities operated by separate corporations and organizations. Private facilities are smaller than public facilities. Half of all juvenile placement facilities in the US are privately operated, and these facilities hold nearly one-third of juvenile offenders.&lt;ref name=OJJDP /&gt;

Since 1997, 44 states and the District of Columbia have experienced a decrease in incarceration of adolescents. As of 2010, only 1 in 4 juveniles in confinement were incarcerated as a result of a violent crime (homicide, robbery, sexual assault, aggravated assault). Additionally, 40% of juvenile delinquency cases and detentions are a result of offenses that are not considered threats to public safety. These include underage possession of alcohol, truancy, drug possession, low-level property offenses, and probation violations.&lt;ref name=AECF /&gt; The most common age of offenders was 17 years old, with 17,500 in placement in 2011. Juveniles aged 12 and under accounted for 1% of all youth in placement.&lt;ref name=OJJDP /&gt;

==Criticisms==

The current debate on juvenile justice reform in the United States focuses on the root of racial and economic discrepancies in the incarcerated youth population. The [[School-to-prison pipeline|school to prison pipeline]] has been described as one mechanism that targets young people in schools and funnels them into the juvenile justice system. [[Zero tolerance (schools)|Zero tolerance]] policies in schools have increased the numbers of young people facing detention. Low-income youth, youth of color and youth with learning and cognitive disabilities are over-represented in the justice system and disproportionately targeted by zero tolerance policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Sentencing Project |title=Disproportionate Minority Contact |url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/publications/jj_dmcfactsheet.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710062558/http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/publications/jj_DMCfactsheet.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Much of the [[Youth_incarceration_in_the_United_States#Criticism_of_juvenile_justice|criticism about the American juvenile justice system]] revolves around its effectiveness in rehabilitating juvenile delinquents.&lt;ref name=Finley /&gt; Research on juvenile incarceration and prosecution indicates that criminal activity is influenced by positive and negative life transitions regarding the completion of education, entering the workforce, and marrying and beginning families.&lt;ref name = DevTheories&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finley|first1=L.|title=Development Theories|journal=The Encyclopedia of Juvenile Violence|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to certain developmental theories, adolescents who are involved in the court system are more likely to experience disruption in their life transitions, leading them to engage in delinquent behavior as adults.&lt;ref name=DevTheories /&gt;

Lois M. Davis et al. argue that adolescents are affected by a juvenile system that does not have effective public policies. Currently the juvenile system has failed to ensure that all youth in the system with learning disabilities or mental health issues, and from lower-class individuals and racial minorities are provided with the benefits for a productive life once out of the system. In 2013 30% of youth in system have a learning disability and nearly 50% test below grade level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Ways Public Policy Has Shaped the Justice System|url=http://publicadmin.usc.edu/resources/infographics/5-ways-public-policy-has-shaped-the-justice-system/|website=University of Southern California Public Administration Program|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the juvenile justice system should be restructured to more effectively lower the chances of future crime among youth, and advocate for increased educational programs for incarcerated youth as the most important method to reduce [[recidivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Lois M.|last2=Steele|first2=Jennifer L.|last3=Bozick|first3=Robert|last4=Williams|first4=Malcolm V.|last5=Turner|first5=Susan|last6=Miles|first6=Jeremy N.

A 12 BC report from The Council of State Governments Justice Center showed only states provide incarcerated youth with the same educational services as the general student population in the United States. The report recommended juvenile detention facilities should be held to the same academic standards as other public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the74million.org/article/the-lost-kids-new-report-exposes-startling-lack-of-education-standards-at-juvenile-justice-facilities|title=The Lost Kids: New Report Exposes Startling Lack of Education Standards at Juvenile Justice Facilities|last=Keierleber|first=Mark|date=November 5, 2015|work=|access-date=April 4, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed reforms==

Many scholars stress the importance of reforming the juvenile justice system to increase its effectiveness and avoid discrimination. Finley argues for early intervention in juvenile delinquency, and advocates for the development of programs that are more centered on rehabilitation rather than punishment.&lt;ref name=Finley /&gt; James C. Howell et al. argue that zero tolerance policies overwhelm the juvenile justice system with low risk offenders and should be eliminated. They also argue that the most effective ways to reform the juvenile justice system would be to reduce the overrepresentation of minorites and eliminate the transfer of juveniles to the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howell|first1=James C.|last2=Lipsey|first2=Mark W.|last3=Wilson|first3=John H.|title=A Handbook for Evidence-Based Juvenile Justice Systems|date=2014|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Zimring and Tannenhaus also discuss the future of the juvenile justice system in the United States. They argue that educational reentry programs should be developed and given high importance alongside policies of dropout prevention. Reentry programs focus on providing care and support to juveniles after being released from detention facilities, and encouraging family support to help adolescents during this adjustment period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bilchik|first1=Shay|title=Critical Elements of Juvenile Reentry in Research and Practice|url=http://csgjusticecenter.org|website=Justice Center: The Council of State Governments - Collaborative Approaches to Public Safety|publisher=CSG Justice Center|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also argue for the elimination of juvenile sex offender registration requirements, and the reform of criminal record information for juvenile offenders.&lt;ref name=Zimring /&gt;

Some popular suggested reforms to juvenile detention programs include changing policies regarding incarceration and funding. One recommendation from the Annie E. Casey Foundation is restricting the offenses that are punishable by incarceration, so that only youth who present a threat to public safety are confined. Other suggestions include investing in alternatives to incarceration, changing economic incentives that favor incarceration, and establishing smaller, more humane and treatment-oriented detention centers for the small number who are confined.&lt;ref name=AECF /&gt;

===Positive Youth Development and the juvenile justice system===

[[Positive Youth Development]] (PYD) encompasses the intentional efforts of other youth, adults, communities, government agencies and schools to provide opportunities for youth to enhance their interests, skills, and abilities.

The justice system offers specific services to youth facing significant mental health and substance use challenges, but the majority of youth do not qualify for these targeted programs and interventions.  Butts, et al. suggest that the integration of positive youth development into the juvenile justice system would benefit youth charged with nonviolent, less serious offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butts|first1=Jeffery|last2=Bazemore|last3=Saa Meroe|title=Positive Youth Justice: Framing Justice Interventions Using the Concepts of Positive Youth Development.|journal=Coalition for Juvenile Justice.|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread implementation of PYD approaches in the juvenile justice system faces many challenges. Philosophically however, the PYD framework resembles the progressive era ideals that informed the creation of the first juvenile court. As Butts, Mayer and Ruther describe, "The concepts underlying PYD resemble those that led to the founding of the american juvenile justice system more than a century ago. [...] Organizers of the first juvenile courts saw the solution to delinquency in better schools, community organizations, public health measures, and family supports. They believed an improved social environmental would encourage youth to embrace pro-social norms." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butts|first1=Jeffery|last2=Mayer|first2=Susan|last3=Ruther|first3=Gretchen|title=Issue Brief: Focusing Juvenile Justice on Positive Youth Development|journal=Chapin Hall: Center for Children at the University of Chicago|date=2005|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integration of PYD into the juvenile justice system is informed by [[social learning theory]] and [[social control theory]].  Taken together, these theories suggest that "youth are less attracted to criminal behavior when they are involved with others, learning useful skills, being rewarded for using those skills, enjoying strong relationships and forming attachments, and earning the respect of their communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butts|first1=Jeffery|last2=Bazemore|last3=Saa Meroe|title=Positive Youth Justice: Framing Justice Interventions Using the Concepts of Positive Youth Development.|journal=Coalition for Juvenile Justice.|date=2010|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in stark contrast to  the theories of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] and [[retributive justice]] espoused by the current justice system.

===Youth court===

[[Juvenile court|Youth courts]] are programs in which youth sentence their peers for minor delinquent and status offenses and other problem behaviors.  The program philosophy is to hold youth responsible for problem behavior, educate youth about the legal and judicial systems, and empower youth to be active in solving problems in their community.  Youth courts function to determine fair and restorative sentences or dispositions for the youth respondent.  Youth court programs  can be administered by juvenile courts, juvenile probation departments, law enforcement, private nonprofit organizations, and schools. Youth court programs operate under four primary models: Adult Judge, Youth Judge, Peer Jury, and Youth Tribunal Models.  
Under the adult judge model, an adult volunteer serves as the judge while youth volunteers serve as prosecuting and defense attorneys, jurors, clerks, and bailiffs.  Under the youth judge model, youth volunteers fill all roles, including judge.  Under a peer jury model, youth jurors question the respondents and make sentencing determinations.  Under a youth tribunal model, youth serve as prosecuting and defense attorneys, and present their cases to a panel of youth judges, who then make a sentencing determination. To date, there are no comprehensive national guidelines for youth courts, but rather, courts operate under and are tailored to their local jurisdictions.  To date, there are more than 675 youth courts in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts and Stats|website=National Association of Youth Courts|url=http://www.youthcourt.net/?page_id=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[East Palo Alto]] and [[Boston]] have both implemented youth courts.  The East Palo Alto youth court is based on restorative justice principles. Eligible youth must admit the facts of the case, after which youth attorneys explain the facts of the case to a youth jury.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epayouthcourt.org/About_Us.html East Palo Alto, CA&lt;/ref&gt;
In Boston, youth court is available to first time, low level offenders. It is based on a restorative justice framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://greaterbostonyouthcourt.wordpress.com/about/|title=What is GBYC?|date=14 April 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restorative justice===

[[Restorative justice]] is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of the victims and the offenders, and the involved community, rather than punishing the offender. Victims and offenders both take an active role in the process, with the latter being encouraged to take responsibility for their actions.  Doing so is an attempt by offenders to repair the harm they've done and also provides help for the offender in order to prevent future offenses. Restorative justice is based on a theory of justice that views crime to be an offense against an individual and/or a community, versus the state.  Programs that promote dialogue between victim and offender demonstrate the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/RJ_full_report.pdf |first=Lawrence W |last=Sherman |first2=Heather |last2=Strang |title=Restorative Justice: The Evidence |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |year=2007 |access-date=2015-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004145609/http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/RJ_full_report.pdf |archive-date=2012-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raise the age===

Many advocates argue that the juvenile system should extend to include youth older than 18 (the age that most systems use as a cut-off). Research in neurobiology and developmental psychology show that young adults'  brains do not finish developing until their mid-20s, well beyond the age of criminal responsibility in most states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Why 21 year-old offenders should be tried in family court|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/time-to-raise-the-juvenile-age-limit/2015/10/02/948e317c-6862-11e5-9ef3-fde182507eac_story.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-10-02|access-date = 2016-02-01|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Vincent|last = Schiraldi|first2 = Bruce|last2 = Western}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other non-criminal justice systems acknowledge these differences between adults and young people with laws about drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, etc.

The '''Australian dividend imputation system''' is a [[corporate tax]] system in which some or all of the tax paid by a company may be attributed, or [[imputation (economics)|imputed]], to the shareholders by way of a [[tax credit]] to reduce the income tax payable on a distribution. In comparison to the classical system, [[dividend imputation]] reduces or eliminates the tax disadvantages of distributing dividends to shareholders by only requiring them to pay the difference between the corporate rate and their marginal rate.

The objective of the dividend imputation system is to eliminate [[double taxation]] of company profits, once at the corporate level and again on distribution as dividend to shareholders. More specifically, it is intended to create a "[[level playing field]]" by taxing the same activity in the same way, irrespective of the business structure being used, namely a company or trust, [[sole trader]] or [[partnership]]. Under the previous system, the company and shareholders had an incentive for the taxed income of the company to be retained by the company. 

==History ==
{{main|Australian corporate tax rate}}
Before 1987, an Australian company would pay [[corporate tax|company tax]] on its profits at a flat rate of 49%; and if it then paid a dividend, that dividend was taxed again as income for the shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;Act No. 59 of 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The company and shareholders had an incentive for the taxed income of the company to be retained by the company. Paying a dividend gave raise to [[double taxation]], once by the company at the corporate rate and then on dividend income in the hands of the company’s shareholders. 

Dividend imputation was introduced in Australia in 1987 to stop this effect and create a "level playing field". The company tax rate was reduced to 39% in 1988 and 33% in 1993, and increased again in 1995 to 36%, to be reduced to 34% in 2000 and 30% in 2001.&lt;ref name="Reinhardt and Steel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.treasury.gov.au/documents/1156/HTML/docshell.asp?URL=01_Brief_History.asp|title=Economic Roundup Winter 2006: A brief history of Australia’s tax system|publisher=Australian Government &amp;#124; The Treasury|last1=Reinhardt|first1=Sam|last2=Steel|first2=Lee|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/factcheck/2016-06-29/fact-check-labor-on-corporate-tax-cuts/7549754|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|title=Fact check: Did Labor previously make the same arguments as the Government on company tax?|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dividend imputation was introduced in 1987, one of a number of tax reforms by the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]]–[[Paul Keating|Keating]] Labor Government. Prior to that a company would pay company tax on its profits and if it then paid a dividend, that dividend was taxed again as income for the shareholder, i.e. a part owner of the company, a form of [[double taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;Act No. 59 of 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the eligibility rules (below) were introduced by the [[John Howard|Howard]]–[[Peter Costello|Costello]] Liberal Government, with a $2,000 small shareholder exemption. In 1999 that exemption was raised to the present $5,000. In 2000, franking credits became fully refundable, not just reducing tax liability to zero. In 2002, preferential dividend streaming was banned. In 2003, [[New Zealand]] companies could elect to join the system for Australian tax they paid.

From 2015/16, designated "small business entities" with an aggregated annual turnover threshold of less than $2 million were eligible for a lower tax rate of 28.5%. Since 1 July 2016, small business entities with aggregated annual turnover of less than $10 million have had a reduced company tax rate of 27.5%. Additionally, the Australian Government announced that from 2017/18, corporate entities eligible for the lower tax rate will be known as "base rate entities". The small business definition will remain at $10 million from 2017–18 onwards, however the base rate entity threshold (the aggregated annual turnover threshold under which entities will be eligible to pay a lower tax rate) will continue to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-businesses/Reducing-the-corporate-tax-rate/|title=Reducing the corporate tax rate|date=4 July 2017|publisher=Australian Taxation Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
The present operation of the system is as follows. The actual law is complex, the core is in the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936]] and other elements are in the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1997]].

Australian companies that have paid Australian company tax can declare how much of the tax it paid is to be imputed or associated with any dividend it pays. Dividends with the maximum imputed tax amount are called franked dividends, while any other dividends are unfranked. [[Income tax in Australia#Residency for tax purposes|Australian-resident shareholders]] who receive franked dividends from Australian companies would declare both the dividends and the associated imputation credits (as well as the unfranked dividends) on their tax returns, but are entitled to claim back a tax credit (called a franking credit) on those imputation credits.

Initially, in 1987, excess franking credits over the tax liability were lost, but since 2000, such excess credits have been refundable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Investing/In-detail/Investing-in-shares/Refunding-franking-credits---individuals/|title=Refunding excess franking credits – individuals|date=28 June 2017|publisher=Australian Taxation Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-resident shareholders are not entitled to claim a tax credit or refund of imputation credits. Unfranked dividends received by non-residents are subject to a [[withholding tax]], which does not apply to franked dividends.

Say, a company makes a profit of $100 and pays company tax of $30 (at 2006 rates) and records the $30 in the franking account. The $30 is paid to the tax office. The company now has $70 left to pay a dividend, either in the same year or later years. When it does so, it may attach a franking credit from its franking account, in proportion to the tax rate. So if it pays a $70 dividend it could attach $30 of franking credits. When the dividend is paid, the franking account is debited by $30.

An eligible shareholder receiving a franked dividend declares the cash amount plus the franking credit as income, and is credited with the franking credit against their final tax bill. The effect is as if the tax office reversed the company tax by giving back the $30 to the shareholder and had them treat the original $100 of profit as income, in the shareholder's hands, like the company was merely a conduit.

Thus company profits going to eligible shareholders are taxed just once. Profits are either retained by the company and taxed there at the corporate rate, or paid out later as dividends and instead they're taxed at the shareholder's rate.

Dividends may still be paid by a company when it has no franking credits (perhaps because it has been making tax losses), this is called an ''unfranked dividend''. Or it may pay a franked portion and an unfranked portion, known as ''partly franked''. An unfranked dividend (or the unfranked portion) is [[ordinary income]] in the hands of the shareholder.

== Franking credits ==
Companies can determine the proportion of the [[dividend]]s they pay will have franking credits attach. This can range from the dividend being fully franked to it being entirely unfranked. A franking credit is a nominal unit of tax paid by companies using dividend imputation. 

[[Shareholder]]s who are [[Income tax in Australia#Residence|residents of Australia for tax purposes]] include in their assessable [[income]] the '''grossed-up''' dividend amount (being the total of the dividend payable plus the associated franking credits). The [[income tax]] payable by the shareholders is calculated, and the franking credits are applied to offset the tax payable. In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] the end result is the elimination of [[double taxation]] of company profits.

===Franking credit formula===
For a company that pays tax on all its income in Australia, the franking proportion is usually 100% (or 1). However, some companies (particularly those paying tax outside of Australia) have a lower franking proportion. 

====Fully-franked dividend====
'''Franking Credits = (Dividend Amount / (1 − Company Tax Rate)) − Dividend Amount'''

Example - a company pays a 30% company tax rate and distributes a $7.00 dividend to shareholders:

Franking Credits = ($7.00 / (1 − 0.3)) − $7.00

&lt;nowiki&gt;= ($7.00 / (0.7)) − $7.00&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;= $10.00 − $7.00&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;= $3.00&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Franking Credits = $3.00

The shareholder is credited $3.00.

====Partially-franked dividend====
'''Franking Credits from Partial Franking = ((Dividend Amount / (1 − Company Tax Rate)) − Dividend Amount) × Franking Proportion'''

Example - a company pays a 30% company tax rate but is only eligible for 50% franking and distributed a $7.00 dividend to shareholders:

Franking Credits from Partial Franking = (($7.00 / (1 − 0.3)) − $7.00) × 0.5

&lt;nowiki&gt;= (($7.00 / (0.7)) − $7.00) × 0.5&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;= ($10.00 − $7.00) × 0.5&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;= $3.00 × 0.5&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;= $1.50&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Franking Credits from Partial Franking = $1.50

The shareholder is credited $1.50.

== Refund ==
Franking credits on dividends received after 1 July 2000 are refundable [[tax credit]]s. It is a form of tax prepayment, which can reduce a taxpayer's total tax liability, with any excess being refunded. For example, an individual with income below the [[tax-free threshold]] ($18,200 since 2011/12) will pay no tax at all and can get a refund of the franking credits in full, after a tax return is lodged.

Prior to 1 July 2000 such excess franking credits were lost. For example, an individual at that time paying no tax would get nothing back, and would merely keep the cash part of the dividend received.

== Investors ==
A franking credit is income received by the shareholder, though it is not paid in cash. It is a credit towards tax that may be payable by the shareholder. Thus a franked dividend of $0.70 plus a $0.30 franking credit is equivalent to an unfranked dividend of $1.00, or to bank [[interest]] of $1.00, or any other ordinary income of that amount. (It is exactly equivalent because franking credits are fully refundable, as described above.)

Franked dividends are often described as a "tax effective" form of income. The basis for this is that the cash $0.70 looks like it is taxed at a lower rate than other income. For example, for an individual on the top rate of 48.5% (for 2006) the calculation is $0.70 plus $0.30 credit is $1.00 on which $0.485 tax is payable, but less the $0.30 credit makes $0.185 net tax, which is just 26.4% of the original $0.70. Conversely, an individual on the 20% marginal tax rate actually gets a $0.10 rebate. In this latter case, the rebate looks very much like negative tax.

There's nothing inherently wrong with the latter way of thinking about franked dividends, and it is frequently made to demonstrate how franking benefits the investor, but it can be argued a grossing-up like the former is better when comparing yields across different investment opportunities.

==Restrictions on eligibility ==
There are restrictions on who can claim franking credits. Those who cannot claim the credit simply declare as income the cash part of the dividend amount received, and ignore the franking credit on the tax return. The "holding period rule" has applied since 1 July 2000. Its objective is to prevent traders buying shares on the last cum-dividend date and selling them the following day ex-dividend. The typical result would be that the trader would receive the dividend, together with the franking credits, while incurring an equivalent capital loss and qualifying for the franking credit with only overnight risk in holding the shares. 

An eligible shareholder is one who either:

* holds the shares for a continuous period of 45 days or more (not counting purchase and sale days); or 90 days in the case of certain [[preferred stock|preference share]]s. This is the "holding period rule". Shares must be "at risk" for the necessary period, i.e. not with an offsetting [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s position for instance, or 

* has total franking credits for the tax year of less than $5000 (the "small shareholder exemption") and has not arranged to pass-on the benefits to someone else (the "related payments rule").

Thus franking credits are not available to short-term traders, only to longer term holders, but with small holders exempted provided it's for their own benefit.

The small shareholder exemption is not a "first $5000", but rather once the $5000 threshold is passed the rule is inoperative and all the shares are under the holding period rule.

For the holding period rule, parcels of shares bought and sold at different times are reckoned on a "first in, last out" basis. Each sale is taken to be of the most recently purchased shares. This prevents a taxpayer buying just before a dividend, selling just after, and asserting it was older shares sold (to try to fulfill the holding period).

This "first in, last out" reckoning may be contrasted with [[capital gains tax]]. For capital gains the shareholder can nominate what parcel was sold from among those bought at different times.

== Company shareholders ==
A dividend received by a company shareholder is income of the receiving company, but the dividend income is not grossed-up for the franking credit nor is the receiving company entitled to claim the franking credit as a tax credit. Instead, the franking credit is added directly to the receiving company's franking account, and can be paid out in the same way as franking credits generated by the receiving company.

This transfer of credits has made the previous "intercorporate rebates" allowances redundant.  Those rebates had avoided double taxation on dividends paid from one company to another company. Those rebates were part of the original 1936 Taxation Act (section 46), meaning that the principle of eliminating double taxation has been present to some degree in Australian income tax law for a very long time.

The company tax rate has changed a few times since the introduction of dividend imputation. In each case transitional rules have been made to maintain the principle of reversing the original tax paid, even if the tax rate has changed. This has been either by separate franking accounts for separate rates (e.g. class A 39%, class B 33%), or making an adjusting recalculation of the credits (e.g. into class C 30%).

== Trans-Tasman Imputation ==
[[New Zealand]] companies can apply to join the Australian dividend imputation system (from 2003).  Doing so allows them to attach Australian franking credits to their dividends, for Australian tax they have paid.  Those credits can then be used by shareholders who are Australian taxpayers, the same as dividends from an Australian company.

There are certain anti-tax-avoidance rules to prevent New Zealand companies deliberately streaming Australian franking credits towards their Australian shareholders; credits must be distributed on a pro-rata basis.

Note that it is only Australian franking credits which can be used by an Australian taxpayer.  New Zealand imputation credits on dividends paid to an Australian shareholder cannot be used against that shareholder's Australian taxes.

==Dividend streaming==
A company can determine the level of franking credits it will attach to its dividends, and they are not obliged to attach any franking credits. However, it costs the company nothing to attach the maximum amounts of credits it has available, which is the usual practice to benefit eligible shareholders. It is actually possible for a company to attach more franking credits than it has, but doing so attracts certain tax penalties.

Until 2002 it was permissible for companies to direct the flow of franking credits preferentially to one type of shareholder over another so that each could benefit the most as fits their tax circumstances. For example, franking credits are of no use to foreign shareholders, who cannot offset them against [[withholding tax]], but Australian shareholders can claim them as a tax credit. This practice, known as ''dividend streaming'', became illegal in 2002, after which all dividends within a given time frame must be franked to a similar (but need not be identical) degree irrespective of shareholder location or which class of shares they hold.

==Division 7A and debit loans by private companies==
Division 7A of the Tax Act applies where there is a loan, payment or the forgiveness of a loan to a shareholder or an associate of a shareholder of a private company.&lt;ref&gt;ATO, [https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Private-company-benefits---Division-7A-dividends/In-detail/Division-7A---Loans/ Loans by private companies]&lt;/ref&gt; When such amounts are not repaid by the end of a financial year they may be treated as unfranked dividends. The total of all dividends a private company can be taken to pay under Division 7A is limited to its "distributable surplus" for that income year, which includes the retained earnings plus provisions made for accounting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;ATO, [https://www.ato.gov.au/business/private-company-benefits---division-7a-dividends/in-detail/division-7a---distributable-surplus/ Distributable surplus]&lt;/ref&gt;

An ‘associate’ is very broad and generally includes a trust under which a shareholder can benefit.&lt;ref&gt;ATO, [https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Private-company-benefits---Division-7A-dividends/Entities-and-taxpayers-affected/ Entities and taxpayers affected]&lt;/ref&gt; This will mean that Division 7A can apply to loans to discretionary trusts and unit trusts in the family group, and sometimes to such trusts not in a family group.

== Effective elimination of company tax and thus incentives ==
To a large extent, dividend imputation makes company tax irrelevant.  This is because every dollar that a company pays in company tax can be claimed by the shareholder as franking credit, with no net revenue flowing to the government.  (There are exceptions which include profits retained by the company that are never paid as dividends, and payments to international investors.)

When gross company tax is reported by Treasury, it is unclear whether the number generally includes the effect of the corresponding franking credits.

One effect is that this has reduced the effectiveness of tax [[incentives]] for corporations. If a corporation was given a tax break then its incomes thus released from taxation would not generate franking credits precisely because no tax was paid. In turn, this meant that the shareholders received fewer credits along with their dividends, meaning in turn that they had to pay more tax.

The net result is that each tax break a corporation itself got was countered by a matching increase in the tax burden of shareholders, leaving shareholders in exactly the same position had no tax break been received by the corporation. Thus, to the extent that corporate directors acted so as to [[increase shareholder wealth]], tax incentives would not influence [[corporate behaviour]].

== Politics and economics ==
&lt;!-- this section previously asserted that the [[Australian Democrats]] are opposed to imputation, but enquiries to them show that this is not the case --&gt;

Dividend imputation has been uncontroversial over most of its lifetime.  Investors and their advisors recognise the benefits and are supportive.

In October 2006, the [[Committee for Economic Development of Australia]] released a report, [http://www.lateraleconomics.com.au/outputs/CEDA%20Tax%20cuts%20to%20compete.pdf ''Tax Cuts to Compete''], concluding that dividend imputation had proved an inefficient means of reducing Australia's cost of capital. The report, authored by prominent economist Dr Nicholas Gruen, argued that the elimination of imputation would allow the funding of a substantial corporate tax cut. This would attract foreign investment and thus increase economic growth, it said.

The '''''Boston College Law Review''''' is an [[academic journal]] of legal scholarship and a student organization at [[Boston College Law School]]. It was established in 1959. Until 1977, it was known as the '''''Boston College Industrial &amp; Commercial Law Review'''''. Among student-edited general-interest [[law reviews]], it is currently ranked 22nd in the Washington and Lee School of Law Law Journal Rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx |title=Law Journals: Submissions and Ranking |publisher=[[Washington and Lee University School of Law]] |date=2014-06-25 |accessdate=2014-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307221833/http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx# |archive-date=2006-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal publishes eight issues each year (plus an online-only issue, known as the E. Supp., that provides commentary on recent en banc and other significant federal circuit court decisions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/law/academics-faculty/law-reviews/bclr.html#recent/E.-Supp.|title=E. Supp. Current Issue|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Boston College Law Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each print issue typically includes four or five articles concerning legal issues of national interest written by outside authors, as well as several student-written notes. The journal has published articles on such wide-ranging topics as the legal issues involved in managing the lives of ex-offenders, the compensation of fund managers in the [[mutual fund]] industry, and the contributions of interdisciplinary evidence scholarship. The journal also hosts symposia from time to time and publishes the resulting scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol58/iss3/|title=One Toke Too Far?

The journal is staffed by approximately 70 second- and 70 third-year law students. Staff positions are filled by students who either attain the top five grades in each first-year section, who score highest in the first-year writing competition, or a combination of these two criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bclawreview.org/membership/ |title=Membership |publisher=Boston College Law Review |accessdate=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Carrick v. Snyder''''' was a 2015 federal court case requesting that the plaintiff Rev. Neil Patrick Carrick be allowed to perform marriage ceremonies that are currently prohibited, including same sex and [[polygamy]] wedding ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/michigan/miedce/5:2015cv10108/297820|title=Carrick v.

The case lists the [[Michigan]] Governor [[Rick Snyder|Governor Rick Snyder]] and Attorney General Bill Schuette as defendants.

The [[Detroit]] minister Pastor Neil Patrick Carrick sued to invalidate Mich. Stat. § 551.14, which provides,

{{quote|If a person authorized to solemnize marriages knowingly joins any persons in marriage contrary to the provisions of this chapter, he or she shall forfeit for each offense a sum not exceeding $500.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/01/14/crime-to-conduct-same-sex-or-polygamous-marriage-ceremony/|title=Crime to conduct same-sex or polygamous marriage ceremony?|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The case was filed on January 12, 2015, in the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division. It was assigned to District Judge [[Judith Ellen Levy]] under the case number 5:2015cv10108.

The '''Colombian Constitution of 1886''' was the [[constitution]] that created the [[Republic of Colombia]]. Before 1886, the country was called [[United States of Colombia]]. The coalition of moderate [[Liberalism in Colombia|Liberals]] and [[Conservatism in Colombia|Conservatives]] that ended the liberal hegemony and placed [[Rafael Núñez (politician)|Rafael Nuñez]] in power repealed the [[Constitution of Rionegro]] and substituted the constitution of 1886. From then on, the country was officially called the '''Republic of Colombia'''.

==Constituent Assembly==
[[Image:Colombia in 1886.svg|thumb|left|200px|Map showing the [[Republic of Colombia]] in 1886.]]

The Constituent Assembly consisted of 18 delegates, two from each of the nine states.

Rafael Núñez announced a national regeneration program and changed the country from a decentralized federal system to a centralized system with a strong central presidency. The presidential term was changed from two to six years. The president of the Republic was elected by the Congress. The president of each state was retitled governor. Governors were to be appointed by the president of the Republic. The governor would choose the mayors of his department, except the mayor of [[Bogotá]], who was chosen by the president himself. Thus, the president in effect had control of the executive at all levels.

In addition, reelection of the president was authorized.

The chamber, the departmental assemblies, and the municipal councils were chosen by popular vote. The Senate was chosen by the departmental assemblies. The suffrage for elections of national scope was limited: men must be at least 21 or older and literate. However, illiterate men could vote in regional elections.

The position of vice-president was reinstated and was initially occupied by [[Eliseo Payán]].

The [[Catholic church|Catholic]] religion became the official religion. In 1887, President Núñez made a concordat with the [[Holy See|Vatican]], reinstating powers to the Catholic Church that they had lost in the previous constitution.

This method of implementing constitutional changes based on the partisan wind of the moment, without having to be the result of agreement by the different political parties or the will of the people, was one of the causes of bipartisan polarization and violence in Colombia for many years. The population began to identify themselves more with the party concept than with the nation concept. The radical liberal segment was never reconciled to the loss of power and on three occasions, between 1885 and 1895, they tried to gain it by force. It took 44 years (up to 1930) for the Liberal party to regain power. The Constitution of 1886 remained effective for more than 100 years, guiding the mandate of 23 presidents of the Republic of Colombia, until 1991.

===Separation of Panama 1903===

{{main|Separation of Panama from Colombia}}

In the [[Hay–Herrán Treaty]], signed January 22, 1903, Colombia would have indefinitely rented a strip of land to the United States for the construction of a canal in the [[Department of Panama]]. Under this agreement, the United States would pay Colombia US$10 million and after nine years an annuity of $250,000 per year. The proposal was rejected by the Colombian Congress, who considered it disadvantageous to the country, not only because the payments would not last forever, but because conceding the isthmus indefinitely to a foreign country represented a loss of national sovereignty.

On November 3, 1903 [[Panama]] separated from Colombia with the direct support of the United States. On November 6, the United States recognized Panama's sovereignty and on November 11, the United States informed Colombia they would oppose Colombian troops if they attempted to recover Panama and backed the claim by sending warships to the isthmus. The [[Thousand Days' War]], along with political disorganization in Bogotá, had left Colombia too weak to oppose the separation. On November 18, the United States signed the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] with Panama for the construction of the [[Panama Canal]].

===The Reform of 1905===
[[image:Rafael Reyes.jpg|thumb|right|Rafael Reyes in a 1904 portrait]]
In December 1904, a few months after being elected president, General [[Rafael Reyes]] shut down Congress because of its unwillingness to approve the reforms he desired. At the beginning of 1905, he summoned a National Constituent Assembly consisting of three representatives from each department, chosen by the departmental administrators.

The Assembly abolished the vice-presidency, two of the ''designaturas'', and the State Council. It also specified that the magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice would serve for life, recognized the right of representation for minorities, and the possibility of reforming the Constitution by means of a National Assembly.&lt;ref name="Rios"/&gt;

The National Assembly demonstrated its support for a government with a dictatorial character when it established a presidential period of 10 years for General Reyes (from January 1, 1905 to January 31, 1914), with the possibility of directly appointing his successor. If the new president were someone other that Reyes the term would be for four years.&lt;ref name="Rios"&gt;[http://lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/enero1991/enero1.htm Rios Peñalosa, Gilma; Las constituyentes de 1905 y 1910; Revista Credencial; 2005-05-17]
&lt;/ref&gt; However, General Reyes overthrown in 1909.

===The Reform of 1910===

Because of the unexpected overthrow of General Reyes on June 13, 1909, the Congress chose the former vice-president, conservative General [[Ramón González Valencia]], to serve as Interim President of Colombia from August 3, 1909 to August 7, 1910.

In 1910, González summoned a National Assembly (elected through the municipal councils) to reform the Constitution of 1886, which started sessions on May 15. This important reform, inspired by the members of the '''Republican Union''' (a third political party with bipartisan principles of free elections and religious tolerance), banned the participation of the military in politics and established the direct popular election of the president, departmental assemblies and municipal council. It reduced the presidential period from 6 to 4 years, prohibited the immediate reelection of presidents, eliminated the figure of the vice-president and replaced it by one appointee that would be chosen by the Congress. It established a system of proportional representation for the appointment of members of public corporations according to votes obtained, assuring a minimum of one third for the opposition party. It granted the Congress the faculty to choose the magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice, consecrating constitutional control of the Supreme Court of Justice. With these reforms the presidential powers were reduced.

Before this reform, the president was chosen by the electoral college that represented the electoral districts.

This reform kept in force the previous voter qualifications: literacy requirement and an annual rent of at least 300 pesos or possessing real estate with a value of at least 1,000 pesos.

The president retained the power to name governors who in turn would appoint mayors, [[Corregidor (position)|corregidores]], administrators, directors of post offices, heads of jails, managers of banks, and others.

It was not until August 27, 1932, during the government of [[Enrique Olaya Herrera|Olaya Herrera]], that the number of seats in Congress was regulated with Law no. 7. This new law set the number of seats for each party to be proportional to the number of votes obtained by each party, with a minimum of one-third of the seats for the opposition party. Guaranteeing one-third of the seats for the opposition had indirect undesired effects. During conservative governments, the liberal party boycotted the electoral process as a means of protest in several elections, knowing that in any case it would obtain one-third of the positions in Congress. On one occasion, not even the third part was accepted.

To begin the period of transition, on July 15, the Constituent National Assembly made an exception to the rule of popular election of presidents and elected the first president of the Republican Union, [[Carlos Eugenio Restrepo]], and also chose the first and second designates.

===The Reform of 1936===

On August 1, 1936, during the government of [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]], the Congress made several reforms. Illiterate men could now vote. This rule was implemented for the first time in the presidential election of 1938, which the liberal [[Eduardo Santos]] won.

Although they were not considered citizens for the purposes of suffrage, women were granted the right to occupy most public positions and began to attend university. Control of the Catholic Church over education started to wane.

===The Reform of 1954===

During the government of [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]] and by his suggestion, the National Constituent Assembly (Asamblea Nacional Constituyente, ANAC) unanimously recognized the political rights of women by means of the Legislative Act No. 3 of August 25, 1954. Women exerted this right for the first time during the plebiscite of December 1, 1957, to approve the constitutional change that would allow both traditional political parties, Liberal and Conservative, to govern together as the [[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]].

Three attempts to recognize the right of women to vote had failed. The first attempt was in, in 1934, during the government of [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]], a law was presented to the Congress failed to pass. Voting rights for women did not appear in the constitutional reform of that year. The second attempt was the proposal presented by liberal [[Alberto Lleras Camargo]] in 1944; it was postponed under the excuse that this regulation could not be approved before 1948. The third attempt was the proposal presented by the liberal [[Alfonso Romero Aguirre]] in 1948, which was slated to be implemented in a gradual fashion, but it was really another postponement.

===The Reform of 1957===

In October 1957, the temporary [[Colombian Military Junta of 1958|Military Junta]] that succeeded Rojas Pinilla authorized with the agreement of the traditional political parties constitutional reform by means of the Legislative Act No. 0247. This legislation fixed the parity of the parties with the stated purpose of finding a solution to the problems of the country. This agreement and the corresponding period was called [[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]].

The plebiscite of December 1, 1957 approved, with almost 94% of votes cast, the constitutional reform giving parity to both traditional parties in control of public corporations for a term of 12 years. It was determined that the elections for President of the Republic, Congress, departmental assemblies, and municipal councils would take place in the first half of 1958.

===The Reform of 1958===

The first Congress elected by popular means within the National Front made a constitutional change to extend the term of the National Front from 12 to 16 years and decided that the first president would be Liberal, not Conservative as had been agreed before.

===The Reform of 1968===

Although the National Front ended in 1974, the constitutional reforms preparing for the transition began in 1968 during the government of [[Carlos Lleras Restrepo]], the next to last President of the National Front.

With the purpose of regulating the electoral competition between parties, the reforms eliminated the distribution by halves for departmental assemblies and municipal councils. Also included were some measures to recognize minority parties. Some required reforms were postponed, in some cases indefinitely, such as the ordinal one of '''article 120''' of the Constitution granting "the right and fair participation of the second party in voting." Article 120 had the unintended effect of limiting the participation of minority parties and therefore limiting citizen participation. It established that later reforms to the constitution could be made by the Congress, as long as the reform was approved by two-thirds majority of the members of the Senate and the in camera voting of two consecutive ordinary legislative sessions.

===The Reform of 1984===

On November 21, 1984, during the government of [[Belisario Betancur]], the Congress established popular voting for mayors and governors, with the aim of reducing or eliminating central control of the parties over nominations and of improving regional democracy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1915">'''Concession and Agreement''' (full title: ''The Concession and Agreement of the Lords Proprietors of the Province of New Caesarea, or New Jersey, to and With All and Every the Adventurers and All Such as Shall Settle or Plant There'') was a 1664 document that provided [[religious freedom]] in the [[Province of New Jersey|colony of New Jersey]]. It was issued as a proclamation for the structure of the government for the colony written in 1664 by the two proprietors, Lord [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton|John Berkeley]] and Sir [[George Carteret]]. The document promised [[religious freedom]] to all inhabitants of New Jersey, and also declared that the proprietors would be in charge of appointing the [[List of colonial governors of New Jersey|provincial governors]]. The first such governor to be appointed was [[Philip Carteret (Governor)|Philip Carteret]]. 

The goal of the document was to entice more settlers to farm in New Jersey, so that the two proprietors could earn more profit by collecting [[quit-rent]]s, annual fees paid on granted lands. To encourage such settlement, they allowed religious freedom, which was not available underneath the English government.

The '''Constitution of Apatzingán''' (''formally: Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la América Mexicana" or "Constitutional Decree for the Liberty of Mexican America'' in translation), was promulgated on October 22, 1814, by the [[Congress of Anahuac]] gathered in the city of [[Apatzingán]] because of the persecution of the troops of [[Félix María Calleja del Rey, 1st Count of Calderón|Félix María Calleja]]. The Constitution was valid for insurgent forces in the territories where it gained control during the [[Mexican War of Independence]].

== Background ==
After the death of the [[Roman Catholic priest]] and revolutionary leader, [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], on June 28, 1813, [[José María Morelos]] from [[Acapulco]] made a call to create a Congress in September in the city of [[Chilpancingo]] (now in the state of [[Guerrero]]), whose purpose was to create an independent government. Proclaimed as ''Supreme National Congress'', was installed on September 14, 1813; that same day Morelos announced to the Assembly a program called [[Sentimientos de la Nación]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sentimientos de la nación, de José María Morelos. | url=http://www.biblioteca.tv/artman2/publish/1813_112/Sentimientos_de_la_naci_n_de_Jos_Mar_a_Morelos_145.shtml| language =Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which was declared the independence of the Mexican America and establish a government of popular representation with division of powers, forbade slavery and the division of population into castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Historia de México: legado histórico y pasado reciente | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbYYZiMANjEC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;sig=AqKCDSqQKvNSGsNdPthB2UdEQ20&amp;hl=es#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| language =Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 November, same year, the Congress signed the first official document of independence, known as the [[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Declaración de Independencia de México | url=http://www.biblioteca.tv/artman2/publish/1813_112/Declaraci_n_de_Independencia_de_M_xico_150.shtml| language =Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
'''Constitution of Apatzingán''' was composed of 2 titles and 242 articles, was based on the same principles that the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution of Cádiz]] but in a modified form, as opposed to the Spanish constitution, provided the establishment of the [[Republic|republican system of government]]. The most relevant articles were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Declaración Decreto constitucional para la libertad de la América mexicana, sancionado en Apatzingan á 22 de Octubre de 1814.  | url=http://www.biblioteca.tv/artman2/publish/1814_111/Decreto_constitucional_para_la_libertad_de_la_Am_rica_mexicana_sancionado_en_Apatzingan_22_de_Octubre_de_1814.shtml| language =Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. The [[Catholic Church|Catholic, apostolic and Roman religion]], is the only to be profess by the State

:12. These three powers, legislative, executive and judicial, must not be exercised not by one person, or by a single corporation.
:13. Are deemed [[Jus soli|citizens of this America all born]] here.

:42. (The provinces of the Mexican America): Mexico, Puebla, Tlaxcala, Veracruz, Yucatan, Oaxaca, Técpam, Michoacan, Queretaro, Guadalajara, Guanajuato, Potosí, Zacatecas, Durango, Sonora, Coahuila and Nuevo Reino de Leon.

The Supreme Government, (Executive), was composed of three persons, they would have equal authority and responsibility; same as the government would exercise as an alternative every four months. Their most direct authority, in addition to the executive and administrative nature, were to ensure the protection of the rights of citizens: liberty, property, equality and security. The Supreme Government would be exercised by José María Cos, José María Liceaga and José María Morelos.

The Constitution of Apatzingán never really entered into force. Almost a year after it was enacted, his inspiring, José María Morelos y Pavón was imprisoned and was shot on December 22, 1815. So temporary, the royalist troops returned to take control of most of the country, but ultimately could not prevent the ''Mexican America'' independence were to be consummated, first as the [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]] that later became the [[First Mexican Republic|United Mexican States]].

{{slavery}}
'''Corvée''' ({{IPA-fr|kɔʁve|lang|Fr-corvée.ogg}}) is a form of unpaid, [[unfree labour]], which is intermittent in nature and which lasts limited periods of time: typically only a certain number of days' work each year.

'''Statute labour''' is a corvée imposed by a [[state (polity)|state]] for the purposes of [[public works]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/564272/statute-labour&lt;/ref&gt; As such it represents a form of levy ([[taxation]]). Unlike other forms of levy, such as a [[tithe]], a corvée does not require the population to have land, crops or cash. It was thus favored in historical economies in which [[barter]] was more common than cash transactions or circulating money was in short supply.

The obligation for tenant farmers to perform corvée work for landlords on private [[landed estate]]s was widespread throughout history before the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The term is most typically used in reference to [[Medieval Europe|medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]], where work was often expected by a feudal landowner (of their vassals), or by a monarch of their subjects. However, the application of the term is not limited to that time or place; corvée has existed in modern and ancient Egypt, ancient Israel under Solomon,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblestudytools.com/encyclopedias/isbe/solomon.html&lt;/ref&gt; ancient Rome, China and Japan, everywhere in continental Europe, the [[Incan]] civilization, [[Haiti]] under [[Henri Christophe]] and under [[United States occupation of Haiti|American occupation]] (1915&amp;ndash;1934), and [[Chibalo|Portugal's African colonies]] until the mid-1960s. Forms of statute labour officially existed until the early twentieth century in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1541-0064.1999.tb01359.x | volume=43 | title=STATUTE LABOUR ON ONTARIO TOWNSHIP ROADS, 1849–1948: RESPONDING TO A CHANGING SPACE ECONOMY | journal=The Canadian Geographer/Le Géographe canadien | pages=36–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legaltree.ca/node/795|title=Statute Labour Act could mean that some Ontario taxpayers must perform road work|publisher=Legal Tree|language=English|author=Bob Aaron|date=8 December 2007|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "corvée" itself has its origins in Rome, and reached the English language via France. In the Late Roman Empire the citizens performed [[opera publica]] in lieu of paying taxes; often it consisted of road and bridge work. Roman landlords could also demand a number of days' labour from their tenants, and also from the [[freedmen]]; in the latter case the work was called ''opera officialis''. In Medieval Europe, the tasks that [[serf]]s or [[villein]]s were required to perform on a yearly basis for their lords were called ''opera riga''. Plowing and harvesting were principal activities to which this work was applied. In times of need, the lord could demand additional work called ''opera corrogata'' (Latin ''corrogare'', "to requisition"). This term evolved into ''coroatae'', then ''corveiae'', and finally ''corvée'', and the meaning broadened to encompass both the regular and exceptional tasks. This Medieval agricultural corvée was not entirely unpaid: by custom the workers could expect small payments, often in the form of food and drink consumed on the spot. Corvée sometimes included military conscription, and the term is also occasionally used in a slightly divergent sense to mean forced requisition of military supplies; this most often took the form of ''cartage'', a lord's right to demand wagons for military transport.

Because corvée labour for agriculture tended to be demanded by the lord at exactly the same times that the peasants needed to attend to their own plots &amp;ndash; e.g. planting and harvest &amp;ndash; the corvée was an object of serious resentment. By the 16th century its use in agricultural setting was on the wane; it became increasingly replaced by money payments for labour. It nevertheless persisted in many areas of Europe until the French Revolution and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, serfdom, along with heavy forms of corvée were abolished only in 1848. Robert A. Kann, '' A history of the Habsburg Empire, 1526–1918'', University of California Press, 1974, pp. 303–304.&lt;/ref&gt; The word survives in modern usage, meaning any kind of "inevitable or disagreeable chore".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mould |first=Michael |title=The Routledge Dictionary of Cultural References in Modern French |year=2011 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=New York |isbn=978-1-136-82573-6 |page=147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-FNTmUwfpEC&amp;pg=PA147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Austria, Holy Roman Empire, and Germany===
Corvée labour was essential in the feudal economic system of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] – later [[Austrian Empire]] – and most German states that have belonged to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Farmers and peasants were obliged to do hard agricultural work for their nobility. When a cash economy became established, the duty was gradually replaced by the duty to pay taxes.

After the [[Thirty Years' War]], the demands for corvée labour grew too high and the system became dysfunctional. The official decline of corvée is linked to the abolition of [[serfdom]] by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and Habsburg ruler, in 1781. Corvée labour continued to exist, however, and was only abolished during the [[revolutions of 1848]], along with the legal inequality between the nobility and common people.

Bohemia (or Czech lands) were a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as well as the Habsburg monarchy and corvée labour itself was called "robota" in Czech. In Russian and other Slavic languages, "robota" denotes any work but in Czech, it specifically refers to unpaid unfree work, corvée labour, serf labor, or drudgery. The Czech word was imported to a part of Germany where corvée labour was known as Robath, and into Hungarian as ''robot''.

The word "robota" turned out to be optimal for Czech writer [[Karel Čapek]] who, after a recommendation by his brother [[Josef Čapek]], introduced the word "[[robot]]" for (originally anthropomorphic) machines that do unpaid work for their owners in his 1920 play [[R.U.R.]].

===Egypt===
[[File:Wells egyptian peasants taxes.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Egyptian peasants seized for [[tax noncompliance|non-payment of taxes]] during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Pyramid Age]].]]
From the [[Ancient Egyptian|Egyptian]] [[Old Kingdom]] (ca 2613 BC) onward, (the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th Dynasty]]), corvée labour helped in 'government' projects; during the times of the [[Nile River]] floods, labour was used for construction projects such as [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], temples, quarries, canals, roads, and other works.

The 1350 BC [[Amarna letters]] [[Text corpus|correspondence]], (mostly addressed to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]]), has one short letter, with the topic of corvée labour. Of the 382&amp;ndash;Amarna letters, it is an example of an undamaged letter, from [[Biridiya]] of [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]], entitled: ''"Furnishing corvée workers".'' See: city [[Nuribta]].

In later Egyptian times, during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], [[Ptolemy V]], in his [[Rosetta Stone|Rosetta Stone Decree]] of 196 BC, listed 22 accomplishments for being honored and the ten rewards granted to him for his accomplishments. The last reward listed is his making of the [[Rosetta Stone]], (the [[Decree of Memphis (Ptolemy V)]]), in three scripts, to be displayed to the public in the temples-(two near complete copies).

One of the shorter accomplishments listed near the middle of the list,

{{quote|He (pharaoh) decreed:&amp;mdash;Behold, not is permitted to be pressed men of the sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Budge.  ''The Rosetta Stone'', pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The statement implies it was a common practice.

Until the late 19th century, many of the [[Egyptian Public Works]] including the [[Suez Canal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karabell|first=Zachary|title=Parting the Desert, the creation of the Suez Canal|year=2003|publisher=Alfred Knopf|isbn=0375408835|pages=113, 169–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; were built using corvée labour.

Corvée labor in Egypt ended after 1882.  Britain took control of Egypt in 1882 and opposed opposed forced labor on principle,  but they postponed abolition until Egypt had paid off its foreign debts.  It disappeared as Egypt modernised after 1860. During the 19th century the corvée had expanded into a national program. It was favoured for temporary projects such as building irrigation works and dams. However Nile Delta landowners replaced it with cheap temporary labor recruited from Upper Egypt. As a result, the corvée was used only in scattered locales, and even then there was peasant resistance. It disappeared by the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan J. Brown, "Who abolished corvée labour in Egypt and why?." ''Past &amp; Present'' 144 (1994): 116-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In France the corvée existed until August 4, 1789, shortly after the beginning of the [[French Revolution]], when it was abolished along with a number of other feudal privileges of the French landlords. In these later times it was directed mainly towards improving the roads. It was greatly resented, and is considered an important cause of the Revolution. Counterrevolution revived the corvée in France, in 1824, 1836, and 1871, under the name ''prestation''; every able bodied man had to give three days' labour or its money equivalent in order to be allowed to vote. The corvée also continued to exist  under the [[Seigneurial system of New France|Seigneurial system]] in what had been [[New France]], in [[British North America]].
In 1866, during the French occupation of [[Mexico]] the French army under Marshal [[Bazaine]] set up the corvée to provide labor for public works in place of a system of fines.&lt;ref&gt;Jack A. Dabbs.  ''The French Army in Mexico 1861–1867'', p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haiti===
The independent Kingdom of Haiti based at [[Cap-Haïtien]] under [[Henri Christophe]] imposed a corvée system of labor upon the common citizenry which was used for massive fortifications to protect against a French invasion. Plantation owners could pay the government and have laborers work for them instead. This enabled the Kingdom of Haiti to maintain a stronger economic structure than the Republic of Haiti based in [[Port-au-Prince]] in the South under [[Alexandre Pétion]] which had a system of agrarian reform distributing land to the laborers.

After [[United States occupation of Haiti|deploying to Haiti]] in 1915 as an expression of the [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], the United States military enforced a corvée system of labor in the interest of making improvements to infrastructure.&lt;ref name = "UOH"&gt;Paul Farmer, ''The Uses of Haiti'' (Common Courage Press: 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; By official estimates, more than 3,000 Haitians died during this period.

===Imperial China===
Imperial China had a system of conscripting labour from the public, equated to the western corvée by many historians. [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first emperor, and following dynasties imposed it for public works like the [[Great Wall]], the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]], and the system of national roads and highways.

However, as the imposition was exorbitant and punishment for failure draconian, Qin Shi Huang was resented by the people and criticized by many historians.

===Japan===

Corvée-style labour called {{nihongo|yō|[[:ja:租庸調|庸]]}} was found in pre-modern Japan.  During the 1930s, it was common practice to import Corvée labourers from both [[China]] and [[Korea]] to work in coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J Samuels. ''Machiavelli's Children'' (Cornell University Press 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This practice continued until the end of [[World War II]].

===Madagascar===
France annexed [[Madagascar]] as a [[French colonial empire|colony]] in the late 19th century. [[Joseph Gallieni|Governor-General Gallieni]] then implemented a hybrid corvée and [[Tax per head|poll tax]], partly for revenue, partly for labour resources (the French had just [[Abolition of slavery timeline|abolished slavery]] there), and partly to move away from a [[subsistence economy]]; the last feature involved paying small amounts for the [[forced labour]]. This solution to problems typical of [[colonialism]], and contemporary thinking behind it, are described in a 1938 work:

{{quote|There was the introduction of equitable taxation, so vital from the financial point of view; but also of such great political, moral and economic importance. It was the tangible proof of French authority having come to stay; it was the stimulus required to make an inherently lazy people work. Once they had learned to earn they would begin to spend, whereby commerce and industry would develop.

The corvée in its old form could not be continued, yet workmen were required both by the colonists, and by the Government for its vast schemes of public works. The [[Joseph Gallieni|General]] therefore passed a temporary law, in which [[taxation]] and labour were combined, to be modified according to country, the people, and their mentality. Thus, for instance, every male among the [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hovas]], from the age of sixteen to sixty, had either to pay twenty-five [[francs]] a year, or give fifty days of labour of nine hours a day, for which he was to be paid twenty [[centimes]], a sum sufficient to feed him. Exempted from taxation and labour were soldiers, militia, Government clerks, and any Hova who knew [[French language|French]], also all who had entered into a contract of labour with a colonist. Unfortunately, this latter clause lent itself to tremendous abuses. By paying a small sum to some European, who nominally engaged them, thousands bought their freedom from work and taxation by these fictitious contracts, to be free to continue their lazy, unprofitable existence. To this abuse an end had to be made.

The urgency of a sound fiscal system was of tremendous importance to carry out all the schemes for the welfare and development of the island, and this demanded a local budget. The goal to be kept in view was to make the colony, as soon as possible, self-supporting. This end the [[Joseph Gallieni|Governor-General]] succeeded in achieving within a few years.&lt;ref&gt;''The Drama of Madagascar'', Sonia E. Howe, pp. 331&amp;ndash;2. Methuen  &amp; Co. ltd. London, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Philippines===

{{see also|History of the Philippines (1521–1898)#Spanish rule}}

The system of forced labour otherwise known as ''polo y servicios'' evolved within the framework of the ''[[encomienda]]'' system, introduced into the South American colonies by the Spanish government. ''Polo y servicios'' in [[the Philippines]] refers to 40 days forced manual labour for men ranging 16 to 60 years of age; these workers built community structures such as churches. Exemption from ''polo'' was possible via paying the ''falla'' (corruption of the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] ''falta'', meaning "absence"), which was a daily fine of one and a half real. In 1884, the required tenure of labour was reduced to 15 days. The system was patterned after the Mexican ''repartimento'' selection for forced labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal, African colonies===
In Portugal's African colonies (e.g. [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]]), the [[Native Labour Regulations]] of 1899 stated that all able bodied men must work for six months of every year, and that "They have full liberty to choose the means through which to comply with this regulation, but if they do not comply in some way, the public authorities will force them to comply."
&lt;ref&gt;Native Labour Regulations, section 1, 1899, Lisbon; in
Gordon White, Robin Murray, and Christina White, Eds., ''Revolutionary Socialist Development in the Third World''. 1983; Sussex, U.K.; Wheatsheaf Books. p.77.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Africans engaged in subsistence agriculture on their own small plots were considered unemployed. The labour was sometimes paid, but in cases of rule violations it was sometimes not—as punishment. The state benefited from the use of the labour for farming and infrastructure, by high income taxes on those who found work with private employers, and by selling corvée labour to [[South Africa]]. This system of corvée labour, called ''[[chibalo]]'', was not abolished in Mozambique until 1962, and continued in some forms until the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974.

===Romanian principalities===
In Romania, the corvée was called "clacă". Karl Marx describes the corvée system of the [[Danubian Principalities]] as a pre-capitalist form of compulsory over-work. The labour of the peasant needed for his own maintenance is distinctly marked off from the work he supplies to the land-owner (the boyar, or ''boier'', in Romanian) as surplus labour. The 14 days of labour due to the land-owner – as prescribed by the code of the corvée in the ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Règlement organique]]'' – actually amounted to 42 days, because the working day was considered the time required for the production of an average daily product, "and that average daily product is determined in so crafty a way that no Cyclops would be done with it in 24 hours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Capital. A Critique of Political Economy: Volume One|year=1967|publisher=International Publishers|isbn=0717806219|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The code of the corvée was supposed to abolish serfdom, but it couldn't achieve anything in regard to this goal.

A [[Land reform in Romania#1864 reform|land reform]] took place in 1864, after the Danubian Principalities became unified and formed [[United Principalities|The United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia]], which abolished the corvée and turned the peasants into free proprietors. The former owners were promised compensation, which was to be paid from a fund the peasants had to contribute to for 15 years. Besides the annual fee, the peasants also had to pay for the newly owned land, although at a price below market value. These debts made many peasants return to a life of semi-serfdom.

===Russian Empire ===
[[File:Ukaz o trekhdnevnoy barschine.jpg|thumb|right|Paul I's edict, the [[manifesto of three-day corvee]]]]
In the [[Russian Tsardom]] and the [[Russian Empire]] there were a number of permanent corvees called ''[[:ru:тягло|тяглые]] повинности'': carriage corvée (подводная повинность), coachman corvée (ямская повинность), lodging corvée (постоялая повинность), etc.

In the context of the history of Russia, the term ''corvée'' is also sometimes used to translate the terms ''barshchina'' ({{lang|ru|барщина}}) or ''boyarshchina'' ({{lang|ru|боярщина}}), which refer to the obligatory work that the [[Russian serfdom|Russian serfs]] performed for the ''[[pomeshchik]]'' (Russian [[landed nobility]]) on the pomeshchik's land.  While no official government regulation to the extent of ''barshchina'' existed, a 1797 [[ukase]] by [[Paul I of Russia]] described a ''barshchina'' of three days a week as normal and sufficient for the landowner's needs.

In the [[Black Earth Region]], 70% to 77% of the serfs performed ''barshchina''; the rest paid levies (''[[obrok]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, pages 147–8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
In Poland in the 1940s Junacy ([[Służba Pracy]]) was a system of unpaid labour in bad conditions (little food, etc.) where underage people were often tricked or pressed into slavery for months or years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===United States===
Corvée was used in several states in North America especially for road maintenance and this practice persisted to some degree in the United States. Its popularity with local governments gradually waned after the [[American Revolution]] with the increasing development of the monetary economy. After the [[American Civil War]], some [[Southern United States|Southern]] states, with money in short supply, commuted taxing their inhabitants with obligations in the form of labour for public works, or let them pay a fee or a little bit higher tax to avoid it. The system proved unsuccessful because of the poor quality of work; in 1894, the Virginia state supreme court ruled that corvée violated the state constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=9711|title=Virginia as Analogue|publisher=H-Net Reviews|language=English|date=August 2004|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1913 [[Alabama]] became among the last states to abolish it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=flvS-nJga8QC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Corv%C3%A9e+in+alabama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DyEItrQGHl&amp;sig=13LJQSXWXQFp-TNtMa_NoWZqMTw&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIvePp2cTPAhXJd5oKHax6CucQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Corv%C3%A9e%20in%20alabama&amp;f=false|title=Motives and Management|publisher=Way of the World|page=101|language=English|author=MG Lay|date=1992|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern instances==
The government of [[Myanmar]] is well known for its use of the corvée and has defended the practice in its official newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;''Ending Forced Labour in Myanmar: Engaging a Pariah Regime'' Routledge, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bhutan]], the ''{{lang|bo-Latn|[[driglam namzha]]}}'' calls for citizens to do work, such as [[dzong]] construction, in lieu of part of their tax obligation to the state.

In [[Rwanda]], the centuries-old tradition of [[umuganda]], or community labor, still continues, usually in the form of one Saturday a month when citizens are required to perform this work.

The [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] maintains corvée for females (ages 18–35) and males (ages 18–45) of 10 days yearly for public works at the discretion of the authorities. This is termed Labor duty ({{lang-vi|nghĩa vụ lao động}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://moj.gov.vn/vbpq/Lists/Vn%20bn%20php%20lut/View_Detail.aspx?ItemID=6774 "Decree defining labor duty"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The British overseas territory of [[Pitcairn Island]], which has a population of about 50 and no income or sales tax, has a system of "public work" whereby all able-bodied people are required to perform, when called upon, jobs such as road maintenance and repairs to public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onlinepitcairn.com/pitcairn_%20today.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Venezuela]], President [[Nicolás Maduro]] signed a decree in July 2016 that "all workers from the public and private sector with enough physical capabilities and technical know-how be required to work in the agricultural sector for a 60-day period that can be extended for another 60 days 'if the circumstances require it.'" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/07/29/congratulations-to-bolivarian-socialism-venezuela-brings-back-agricultural-slavery&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-late 19th century, most countries have restricted corvée labour to [[conscription]] ([[military service|military]] or [[civilian service]]), or [[prison labour]].

'''David Director Friedman''' (born February 12, 1945) is an American [[economist]], [[physicist]], legal scholar, and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] theorist. He is known for his textbook writings on [[microeconomics]] and the libertarian theory of [[anarcho-capitalism]], which is the subject of his most popular book, ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Caplan|first=Bryan |authorlink=Bryan Caplan |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |title=Friedman, David (1945– ) |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC  |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n117 |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA  |isbn= 978-1412965804 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=194–95 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides ''The Machinery of Freedom'', he has authored several other books and articles, including ''Price Theory: An Intermediate Text'' (1986), ''Law's Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters'' (2000), ''Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life'' (1996), and ''Future Imperfect'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Free Market Mojo.

==Life and work==
David Friedman is the son of economists [[Rose Friedman|Rose]] and [[Milton Friedman]]. He graduated ''magna cum laude'' from [[Harvard University]] in 1965, with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/friedman-david/ Faculty Profile: David Friedman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722163211/http://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/friedman-david/ |date=2014-07-22 }}. Santa Clara Law School&lt;/ref&gt; He later earned a master's (1967) and a [[Ph.D.]] (1971) in theoretical physics from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Academic.html|title=My Academic Page|website=www.daviddfriedman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his later career, he never took a class for credit in either economics or law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Athiparambath|first1=Shanu|title=Economist David Friedman Says India Must Go Taller To Make Homes Affordable|url=http://marketurbanism.com/2016/02/14/economist-david-friedman-says-india-must-go-taller-to-make-homes-affordable/|accessdate=4 October 2016|work=Market Urbanism|date=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently a professor of law at [[Santa Clara University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phonebook.scu.edu/?v=pid&amp;i=462|title=Santa Clara University|first=Santa Clara|last=University|website=phonebook.scu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a contributing editor for ''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'' magazine. He is an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, David D. [http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2008/01/atheism-and-religion.html "Atheism and Religion"], ''Ideas''.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Patri Friedman]], has also written about libertarian theory and market anarchism, particularly [[seasteading]].

===''The Machinery of Freedom''===
{{Main|The Machinery of Freedom}}
In his book ''The Machinery of Freedom'' (1973), Friedman sketched a form of [[anarcho-capitalism]] where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the [[free market]]. This differs from the version proposed by [[Murray Rothbard]], where a legal code would first be consented to by the parties involved in setting up the anarcho-capitalist society. Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual [[privatization]] of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing law and order itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent [[anarcho-capitalist revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Machinery of Freedom|pages=149–150|chapter=Revolution Is the Hell of It|author=Friedman, David D|isbn=0-8126-9069-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He advocates a [[Consequentialist libertarianism|consequentialist]] version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for anarchism on a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of state versus no state.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Christopher. 1992. An Essay on the Modern State. Cambridge University Press. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; It is contrasted with the [[Natural-rights libertarianism|natural-rights]] approach as propounded most notably by economist and libertarian theorist [[Murray Rothbard]].

==Non-academic interests==
Friedman is a longtime member of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], where he is known as ''Duke Cariadoc of the Bow''. He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Restructuring.html|title=Friedman, David D. "On Restructuring the SCA"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work is compiled in the popular ''Cariadoc's Miscellany''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/cariadoc/miscellany.html|title=Cariadoc's Miscellany|website=www.pbm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the [[Pennsic War]]; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge...and lost.&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Watkins (Fólki Þorgilsson). 2005. ''HERSTAĐR-SAGA: An Incomplete History of Pennsic'' Urbana, Illinois: Folump Enterprises&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a long-time [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fan]], and has written two [[fantasy]] novels, ''Harald'' ([[Baen Books]], 2006) and ''Salamander'' (2011).

He has spoken in favor of a [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO1xXD1Cws4|title=Dr David Friedman on US Foreign Policy, Syria, Assad, Terrorism, WWII, Hitler, and much more...|first=|last=VoluntaryVirtues0com|date=22 September 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''De iure belli ac pacis''''' '''''({{lang-en|On the Law of War and Peace}})''''' is a 1625 book in [[Latin]], written by [[Hugo Grotius]] and published in Paris, on the legal status of [[war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86069579/f11.image.r=.langEN ''Hugonis Grotii,  De Jure Belli ac  Pacis, libri tres, In quibus ius naturae &amp; Gentium: item iuris publici preciptae expilicantur'', Pariisis: Apud Nicalaum Buon, M DC XXV, cum privilegio regis via Gallica (the French National Library)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is now regarded as a foundational work in [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/grotius.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Its content owed much to Spanish theologians of the previous century, particularly [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and [[Francisco Suarez]], working in the Catholic tradition of [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. Janis, ''Religion and International Law'' (1999), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grotius began writing the work while in prison in the Netherlands. He completed it in 1623, at [[Senlis, Oise|Senlis]], in the company of [[Dirck Graswinckel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Israel]], ''The Dutch Republic'' (1995), p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pieter Geyl]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is an attempt by a theologically and classically educated jurist to base upon law order and security in the community of states as well as in the national society in which he had grown up. In the rather naïve rationalism, the belief in reason as the lord of life, is revealed the spiritual son of [[Erasmus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pieter Geyl]], ''History of the Dutch-Speaking Peoples 1555-1648'' (2001 English edition), p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In particular, this work is remembered for the Latin sentence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Et haec quidem quae iam diximus, locum aliquem haberent etiamsi daremus, quod sine summo scelere dari nequit, non esse Deum, aut non curari ab eo negotia humana.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hugo|last=Grotius|editor-first=Philip Christiaan|editor-last=Molhuysen|title=Hugonis Grotii.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11225">{{about|the [[English Law]] concept of dishonesty|its broader [[ethics|ethical]] meaning and context|Honesty}}
'''Dishonesty''' is to act without honesty. It is used to describe a lack of probity, [[cheating]],&lt;ref&gt;The effect of anomie on academic dishonesty among university students. Albert Caruana, B. Ramaseshan, Michael T. Ewing Journal: International Journal of Educational Management Year: 2000 Volume: 14 Issue: 1 Page: 23 - 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lie|lying]], or being deliberately [[deceptive]] or a lack in integrity, knavishness, perfidiosity, corruption or treacherousness. Dishonesty is the fundamental component of a majority of offences relating to the acquisition, conversion and disposal of property (tangible or intangible) defined in [[criminal law]] such as [[fraud]].

==English law==
'''Dishonesty''' has had a number of definitions. For many years, there were two views of what constituted dishonesty in [[English law]]. The first contention was that the definitions of dishonesty (such as those within the [[Theft Act 1968]]) described a course of action, whereas the second contention was that the definition described a state of mind. A clear test within the criminal law emerged from ''[[R v Ghosh]]'' (1982)  75 CR App. R. 154. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that dishonesty is an element of ''[[mens rea]]'', clearly referring to a state of mind, and that overall, the test that must be applied is hybrid, but with a subjective bias which "looks into the mind" of the person concerned and establishes what he was thinking. The test is two-stage:
*"Were the person's actions honest according to the standards of reasonable and honest people?" If a [[jury]] decides that they were, then the defendant's claim to be honest will be credible. But, if the [[court]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} decides that the actions were dishonest, the further question is:
*"Did the person concerned believe that what he did was dishonest at the time?"

But this decision was criticised, and over-ruled, by the UK [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] in the case of Ivey v Genting Casinos (UK) Ltd t/a Crockfords [2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/67.html UKSC 67]. The position as a result is that the court must form a view of what the defendant's belief was of the relevant facts (but it is no longer necessary to consider whether the person concerned believed that what he did was dishonest at the time).

Where dishonesty is an issue in civil cases, the trend in English Law is for only the actions to be tested objectively and not to apply any test as to the subjective state of mind of the actor. Now that the decision in Ghosh has been over-ruled the same legal test applies in English law in civil and criminal cases.

===Theft Act 1968===
The [[Theft Act 1968]] contains a single definition for dishonesty which is intended to apply to all the substantive offences. Yet, rather than defining what dishonesty is, s2 describes what it is not, allowing a jury to take a flexible approach, thus:

'''s2(1).''' A person’s appropriation of property belonging to another is not to be regarded as dishonest:

(a) if he appropriates the property in the belief that he has in law the right to deprive the other of it, on behalf of himself or of a third person; or

(b) if he appropriates the property in the belief that he would have the other’s consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it; or

(c) (except where the property came to him as trustee or personal representative) if he appropriates the property in the belief that the person to whom the property belongs cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps.

'''s2(2).''' A person’s appropriation of property belonging to another may be dishonest notwithstanding that he is willing to pay for the property.


*The s2(1)(a) ''claim of right'' is a difficult concept in that it represents a statutory exception to the fundamental [[public policy (law)|public policy]] principle ''[[ignorantia juris non excusat]]'' and allows a limited [[mistake of law]] defence. According to ''R v Turner (No2)'' [1971] 2 All ER 441, a case in which a man was charged with the s1 [[Theft]] of his own car, the test was one of honest belief in a right, not a mere permission, to act in the particular way. In this, the test is subjective and a matter of fact for the jury to decide.
*If the owner or some person able to give a valid [[consent]], actually consented to the taking, the property would not belong to another and no ''[[actus reus]]'' would exist. This provision applies to the situation in which either the consent is void [[ab initio]] or is subsequently voided. If the existence or effect of the vitiating factor is not recognised by the defendant, then he would not be dishonest. For example, if a contract was affected by a common or mutual [[mistake (contract law)|mistake]]. But if the defendant is initially innocent, he may become dishonest is he later realises the mistake and decides to keep the property (i.e. an [[omission (criminal law)|omission]]). Similarly, if has knowingly misrepresented a material fact and this has induced a consent that he knows or ought to know would not have been freely given, he will be dishonest.
*Defendants who are in a [[fiduciary]] relationship are expected to make even unreasonable efforts to identify where the relevant property has come from, but the ordinary defendant who finds property apparently abandoned on the street may not be dishonest if there are no serial numbers or marks that would help to identify the owner. Note that to be abandoned, the owner must have intended to give up all rights in the property and not to pass those rights to another. For example, material discarded in a rubbish bin is not abandoned. The owner intends another to come, empty the bin and dispose of the property without stealing it in the process. Hence, it will be theft to remove any property from a bin or legal disposal site.
*If the defendant knows that the owner will not sell the property, so takes the property in any event but leaves a realistic sum of money by way of payment, this will be a dishonest appropriation.

For the purposes of the [[Deception (criminal law)|deception]] offences, dishonesty is a separate element to be proved. The fact that a defendant knowingly deceives the owner into parting with possession of property does not, of itself, prove the dishonesty. This distinguishes between "obtaining by a dishonest deception" and "dishonestly obtains by a deception".

== Debtors ==
'''Debtor's dishonesty'''&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;Rikoslaki, 39 luku, § 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''dishonesty to creditors'''&lt;ref name="SPC"&gt;Swedish Penal Code, Ds 1999:36. http://www.legislationline.org/documents/id/8919&lt;/ref&gt; is a felony in Finland and Sweden. It is an abuse of the [[bankruptcy]] process, where the debtor attempts to prevent the recovery of assets.

In [[Finland|Finnish]] law, the felonies of debtor's dishonesty (''velallisen epärehellisyys'') and aggravated debtor's dishonesty (''törkeä velallisen epärehellisyys'') are defined. A debtor is dishonest if "1) he destroys his or her property, 2) gives away or otherwise surrenders his or her property without acceptable reason, 3) transfers his or her property abroad in order to place it beyond the reach of his or her creditors or 4) increases his or her liabilities without basis, and thus causes his or her insolvency or essentially worsens his or her state of insolvency". The felony is considered aggravated if "1) considerable benefit is sought, 2) considerable or particularly substantial damage is caused to the creditors, or 3) the offence is committed in a particularly methodical manner". The punishment is fine or imprisonment for at most two years, and four months at minimum and four years at maximum if aggravated.&lt;ref name="RL" /&gt; It is essential that there is a direct cause and effect between a debtor's deliberate action and the insolvency; mere poor management or accidental losses are not grounds for conviction. Taking into account judicial practice, the best defense is to claim a lack of deliberate intent, and demonstrate that the actions were reasonable at the time and not intended to cause insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talousrikos.fi/tietoa/velallisen_rikokset/|title=Velallisen rikokset - Talousrikos.fi|last=|first=|date=|website=www.talousrikos.fi|publisher=|language=Finnish|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit fraud and embezzlement, involving concealment or presenting fraudulent liabilities, are defined separately, as are the less serious deceitfulness and violation by a debtor.&lt;ref name="RL" /&gt;

An example was a case involving the former CEO of [[Suomen työväen säästöpankki|a bank]] as the debtor. The debtor was ordered to pay [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 1.8 million in damages due to reckless lending that had led to a bankruptcy of the bank. However, the debtor kept multiple credit accounts overdrawn by withdrawing large sums of cash, which he claimed were for daily expenses and frequent travel abroad. Thus, garnishment wasn't possible, because he could claim that he had no net worth. The court found it unlikely that such sums could be spent on daily expenses, but were in fact stashed somewhere, and convicted the debtor of aggravated debtor's dishonesty.

In Swedish law, dishonesty to creditors (''oredlighet mot borgenärer'') and aggravated dishonesty to creditors (''grov oredlighet mot borgenärer'') carry a sentence of up to two years and half to six years of imprisonment, respectively.&lt;ref name="SPC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/Informationsmaterial/01%20Polisen%20nationellt/Svensk_engelsk_och_engelsk_svensk_ordlista[1].pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127033721/http://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/Informationsmaterial/01%20Polisen%20nationellt/Svensk_engelsk_och_engelsk_svensk_ordlista%5B1%5D.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-11-27 |title=Svensk-engelsk och engelsk-svensk ordlista: För anställda inom polisen |last= |first= |date= |website=polisen.se |publisher= |language=Swedish |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union}}
The '''European Medicines Agency''' ('''EMA''') is a [[European Union]] agency for the evaluation of [[medication|medicinal products]]. Prior to 2004, it was known as the '''European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products''' or '''European Medicines Evaluation Agency''' ('''EMEA''').&lt;ref&gt;Set up by EC Regulation No. 2309/93 as the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, and renamed by EC Regulation No. 726/2004 to the European Medicines Agency, it had the acronym EMEA until December 2009. The European Medicines Agency does not call itself EMA either – it currently has no official acronym but may reconsider if EMA becomes commonly accepted (see [http://www.ema.europa.eu/pdfs/general/direct/74766509en.pdf communication on new visual identity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601053816/http://www.ema.europa.eu/pdfs/general/direct/74766509en.pdf |date=1 June 2010 }} and [http://www.ema.europa.eu/htms/general/direct/visual_identity.htm logo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225201855/http://www.ema.europa.eu/htms/general/direct/visual_identity.htm |date=25 December 2009 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/emea_becomes_ema_197492&lt;/ref&gt;

The EMA was set up in 1995 with funding from the [[European Union]] and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as indirect subsidy from member states, in an attempt to harmonise (but not replace) the work of existing national [[medication|medicine]] regulatory bodies. The hope was that this plan would not only reduce the €350 million annual cost drug companies incurred by having to win separate approvals from each member state but also that it would eliminate the [[protectionism|protectionist]] tendencies of [[sovereign state]]s unwilling to approve new drugs that might compete with those already produced by domestic drug companies. The EU is currently the source of about one-third of the new drugs brought onto the world market each year.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Based in [[London]], the EMA was founded after more than seven years of negotiations among EU governments and replaced the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products and the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products, though both of these were reborn as the core scientific advisory committees. After the [[United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union]] referendum the agency will relocate to [[Amsterdam]]. The transfer to the Netherlands should take place in March 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-pharmaceuticals-idUKKBN1771XM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Press_release/2017/11/WC500238862.pdf|title=EMA to relocate to Amsterdam, the Netherlands|publisher=European Medicines Agency|date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
The EMA operates as a decentralised scientific agency (as opposed to a regulatory authority) of the [[European Union]] and its main responsibility is the protection and promotion of public and animal health, through the evaluation and supervision of medicines for human and veterinary use. More specifically, it coordinates the evaluation and monitoring of centrally authorised products and national referrals, develops technical guidance and provides scientific advice to sponsors. Its scope of operations is medicinal products for human and veterinary use including biologics and advanced therapies, and herbal medicinal products. The agency is composed of the Secretariat (ca. 600 staff), a management board, seven scientific committees (human, veterinary and herbal medicinal products, orphan drugs, paediatrics, advanced therapies and pharmacovigilance risk assessment) and a number of scientific working parties. The Secretariat is organised into five units: Directorate, Human Medicines Development and Evaluation, Patient Health Protection, Veterinary Medicines and Product Data Management, Information and Communications Technology and Administration. The Management Board provides administrative oversight to the Agency: including approval of budgets and plans, and selection of Executive Director. The Board includes one representative of each of the 28 Member States, two representatives of the European Commission, two representatives of the European Parliament, two representatives of patients' organisations, one representative of doctors' organisations and one representative of veterinarians' organisations. The Agency [[decentralization|decentralises]] its scientific assessment of medicines by working through a network of about 4500 experts throughout the [[EU]]. The EMA draws on resources of over 40 National Competent Authorities (NCAs) of EU Member states.

==Centralised marketing authorisations==
The centralised procedure allows companies to submit a single application to the agency to obtain from the European Commission a centralised (or 'Community') marketing authorisation (MA) valid in all EU and [[European Economic Area]] (EEA)-[[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) states ([[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Norway]]). The centralised procedure is compulsory for all medicines derived from biotechnology and other high-tech processes, as well as for human medicines for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases, and for veterinary medicines for use for growth or yield enhancers. The centralised procedure is also open to products that bring a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or is in any other respect in the interest of patient or animal health. As a result, the majority of genuinely novel medicines are authorised through the EMA.

For products eligible for or requiring centralised approval, a company submits an application for a marketing authorisation to the EMA.

==Committees==
===Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use===

A single evaluation is carried out through the [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]] (CHMP).  If the Committee concludes that the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product is sufficiently proven, it adopts a positive opinion. This is sent to the [[European Commission]] to be transformed into a marketing authorisation valid for the whole of the EU. A special type of approval is the [[paediatric-use marketing authorisation]] (PUMA), which can be granted for medical products intended exclusively for paediatric use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2011/09/WC500112071.pdf|title=Questions and answers on the paediatric use marketing authorisation (PUMA)|publisher=European Medicines Agency|date=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CHMP is obliged by the regulation to reach decisions within 210 days, though the clock is stopped if it is necessary to ask the applicant for clarification or further supporting data.

===Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use===
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) operates in analogy to the CHMP as described above.

===Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products===
The [[Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products]] (COMP) administers the granting of [[orphan drug]] status since 2000. Companies intending to develop medicinal products for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or very serious conditions that affect not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union can apply for 'orphan medicinal product designation'. The COMP evaluates the application and makes a recommendation for the designation which is then granted by the [[European Commission]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products===
The [[Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products]] (HMPC) assists the [[European Pharmaceutical Regulation|harmonisation]] of procedures and provisions concerning herbal medicinal products laid down in EU Member States, and further integrating herbal medicinal products in the European regulatory framework since 2004.

===Paediatric Committee===
The Paediatric Committee (PDCO) deals with the implementation of the paediatric legislation in Europe Regulation(EC) No 1901/2006 since 2007. Under this legislation, all applications for [[European Pharmaceutical Regulation|marketing authorisation]] of new medicinal products, or variations to existing authorisations, have to either include data from paediatric studies previously agreed with the PDCO, or obtain a PDCO waiver or a deferral of these studies.

===Committee for Advanced Therapies===
The [[Committee for Advanced Therapies]] (CAT) was established in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on advanced-therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) such as [[gene therapy]], [[somatic cell]] therapy and [[tissue engineering|tissue engineered]] products. It assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of ATMPs, and follows scientific developments in the field.

===Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee===
A seventh committee, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) has come into function in 2012 with the implementation of the new EU pharmacovigilance legislation (Directive 2010/84/EU).

==Other activities==
The Agency carries out a number of activities, including:

*'''[[Pharmacovigilance]]''': The Agency constantly monitors the safety of medicines through a pharmacovigilance network and EudraVigilance, so that it can take appropriate actions if adverse drug reaction reports suggest that the benefit-risk balance of a medicine has changed since it was authorised.
*'''Referrals''': The Agency coordinates arbitration procedures relating to medicinal products that are approved or under consideration by Member States in non-centralized authorisation procedures.
*'''Scientific Advice''': Companies wishing to receive scientific advice from the CHMP or CVMP on the appropriate tests and studies to carry out in the development of a medicinal products can request it prior to or during the development program.
*'''Telematics projects''': The Agency is responsible for implementing a central set of pan-European systems and databases such as EudraVigilance, EudraCT and EudraPharm.

==Relocation==
Following the 2016 decision of the [[United Kingdom]] to negotiate to leave the European Union ("[[Brexit]]"), the EMA chose to search for another base of operations. According to EU Law the [[European Commission]] had to decide on the fate of the EMA's location. The EU ministers met to vote on their preferred successor.&lt;ref name="EU Agencies Relocation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/relocation-london-agencies-brexit/ema/|title=European Council - Offers to host the European Medicines Agency (EMA)|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's Health Commissioner [[Vytenis Andriukaitis]] said that the preferred choice would be a location where an "easy set up and guarantee of smooth operations" would be available.

It had also been speculated that the [[Strasbourg]]-based seat for the [[European Parliament]] could be moved to Brussels, in exchange for the city to host the EMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/news/strasbourg-could-trade-parliament-seat-for-medicines-agency/ |title=Strasbourg could trade Parliament seat for medicines agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others speculated on the merits of Amsterdam, well before the final decision was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= PharmaTimes, 27th September 2017.

==Criticism of the EMA process==
The review process of the European Medicines Agency regarding medical issues has been criticized for its lack of transparency and issues of conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nordic.cochrane.org/news/complaint-filed-european-medicines-agency-over-maladministration-related-safety-hpv-vaccines 2016-2017 Nordic Cochrane documentation regarding maladministration by EMA]&lt;/ref&gt; In a rebuttal of an EMS review that included her work, Louise Brinth, a Danish physician, noted that "experts" reviewing data remain unnamed and seem to be bound to secrecy. Minutes are not released and diverging opinions are not reported suggesting that all the "experts" are of the same opinion. In her view the process is unscientific and undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Brinth: ''Responsum to Assessment Report on HPV-vaccines released by EMA November 26th 2015.'', [http://www.ft.dk/samling/20151/almdel/suu/bilag/109/1581470.pdf online] (PDF; 1,3&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other regulatory agencies==
The EMA is roughly parallel to the drug part of the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA),&lt;ref name="Gu 2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gu|first1=A|last2=Patel|first2=D|last3=Nayak|first3=R|editor1-last=Fulda|editor1-first=TR|editor2-last=Lyles|editor2-first=A|editor3-last=Wertheimer|title=Pharmaceutical Public Policy|date=2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498748513|pages=151–160|chapter=Chapter 10: Drug shortages}}&lt;/ref&gt; but without [[centralisation]].&lt;ref name="Boslaugh 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boslaugh|first1=SE|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Pharmacology and Society|date=2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781506346182|chapter=European Medicines Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timetable for product approval via the EMA's centralised procedure of 210 days compares well with the average of 500 days taken by the FDA to evaluate a product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/NewsEvents/UCM167310.pdf|title=Generic Drugs: Overview of ANDA Review Process|last=Sherwood|first=Ted|date=16 April 2008|work=CDER Forum for International Drug Regulatory Authorities|publisher=Food and Drug Administration, Office of Pharmaceutical Science|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fire retardant''' is a substance that is used to slow or stop the spread of fire or reduce its intensity.  This is commonly accomplished by chemical reactions that reduce the [[flammability]] of fuels or delay their [[combustion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/wy/st/en/programs/Fire/glossary.html#f |title=BLM Wyoming Wildland Fire Glossary |publisher=Blm.gov |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coford.ie/iopen24/glossary-f-t-277.html Coford Glossary "Fire Retardant"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208221741/http://www.coford.ie/iopen24/glossary-f-t-277.html |date=February 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire retardants may also cool the fuel through physical action or [[Endothermic process|endothermic]] chemical reactions. Fire retardants are available as powder, to be mixed with water, as [[fire-fighting foam]]s and [[fire-retardant gel]]s. Fire retardants are also available as coatings or sprays to be applied to an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zinsser.com/glossary.asp?letter=F |title=Zinsser Glossary |publisher=Zinsser.com |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fire retardants are commonly used in [[fire fighting]], where they may be applied [[Aerial_firefighting|aerially]] or from the ground.

==Principles of operation==
In general, fire retardants reduce the flammability of materials by either blocking the fire physically or by initiating a [[chemical reaction]] that stops the fire.

===Physical action===
There are several ways in which the [[combustion]] process can be retarded by physical action:

* By [[endothermic|cooling]]: Some chemical reactions actually cool the material down.
* By forming a protective layer that prevents the underlying material from igniting.
* By dilution: Some retardants release [[water vapor|water]] and/or [[carbon dioxide]] while burning.  This may dilute the [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]] in the flame enough for it to go out.

Commonly used fire retardant additives include mixtures of [[huntite]] and [[hydromagnesite]], [[aluminium hydroxide]], and [[magnesium hydroxide]]. When heated, [[aluminium hydroxide]] dehydrates to form [[aluminum oxide]] (alumina, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), releasing water vapor in the process.  This reaction [[endothermic|absorbs]] a great deal of [[Heat#Thermal energy|heat]], cooling the material into which it is incorporated. Additionally, the residue of alumina forms a protective layer on the material's surface. Mixtures of [[huntite]] and [[hydromagnesite]] work in a similar manner. They endothermically decompose releasing both water and carbon dioxide,&lt;ref name=Rev1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollingbery|first=LA|author2=Hull TR|title=The Thermal Decomposition of Huntite and Hydromagnesite - A Review|journal=Thermochimica Acta|year=2010|volume=509|issue=1-2|pages=1–11|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/1139|doi=10.1016/j.tca.2010.06.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Therm1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollingbery|first=LA|author2=Hull TR|title=The Thermal Decomposition of Natural Mixtures of Huntite and Hydromagnesite|journal=Thermochimica Acta|year=2012|volume=528|pages=45–52|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/3414|doi=10.1016/j.tca.2011.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  giving fire retardant properties&lt;ref name=Rev2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollingbery|first=LA|author2=Hull TR|title=The Fire Retardant Behaviour of Huntite and Hydromagnesite - A Review|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|year=2010|volume=95|issue=12|pages=2213–2225|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/1432|doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2010.08.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fire1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollingbery|first=LA|author2=Hull TR|title=The Fire Retardant Effects of Huntite in Natural Mixtures with Hydromagnesite|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|year=2012|volume=97|issue=4|pages=504–512|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/3420|doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.01.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fire2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hull|first=TR|author2=Witkowski A |author3=Hollingbery LA |title=Fire Retardant Action of Mineral Fillers|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|year=2011|volume=96|issue=8|pages=1462–1469|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/2963|doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to the materials in which they are incorporated.

===Chemical action ===
* Reactions in the gas phase: chemical reactions in the flame (i.e. gas phase) can be interrupted by fire retardants. Generally, these retardants are [[organic halide]]s ([[haloalkane]]s) such as [[Halomethane|Halon]] and [[PhostrEx]]. The chemicals used in these types of retardants are often toxic. {{further|Flame retardant#Gas phase radical quenching}} 
* Reaction in the solid phase: some retardants break down [[polymer]]s so they melt and flow away from the flame. Although this allows some materials to pass certain flammability tests{{which|date=July 2017}}, it is not known whether fire safety is truly improved by the production of flammable [[plastic]] droplets.
* [[Char]] Formation: For carbon-based fuels, solid phase flame retardants cause a layer of [[carbon]]aceous char to form on the fuel surface. This char layer is much harder to burn and prevents further burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = PHOS-CHeK D75 Fire Retardants  | url = http://phos-chek.com/uploads/images/Product_Profile_D75_ICL.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-11-20  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715080354/http://phos-chek.com/uploads/images/Product_Profile_D75_ICL.pdf  | archivedate = 2011-07-15  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cefic-efra.com/Content/Default.asp?PageName=openfile&amp;DocRef=2006-02-21-00001 |title=How do flame retardants work?|accessdate = 12 Feb 2010|publisher= European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) and European Flame Retardants Association (EFRA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Intumescent]]s: These types of retardant materials incorporate chemicals which cause swelling behind the protective char layer, providing much better [[Thermal insulation|insulation]]. They are available as plastic additives, and as paints for protecting wooden buildings or steel structures.

== Uses ==
[[File:FireExtinguisherABC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Portable [[fire extinguisher]]]]

=== Fire extinguishers ===
[[Fire class|Class A]] foam is used as a fire retardant in 2.5 gallon [APW] and [CAFS] extinguishers to contain incipient brush fires and grass fires by creating a fire break. Other chemical retardants are capable of rendering class A material and Class B fuels non-flammable and extinguishing class A, class B, and some class D fires.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  Fire retardant slurries dropped from aircraft are normally applied ahead of a [[wildfire]] to prevent ignition, while fire suppression agents are used to extinguish fires.

=== Surface coating ===
Objects may be coated with fire retardants. For example, Christmas trees are sprayed with retardants. As a tree dries out it becomes very flammable and a fire-hazard.

Steel structures have a fire retardant coating around columns and beams to prevent structural elements from weakening during a fire.

Dormitories in the US are also considering using these products.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Since 2000, 109 people have died in fires in dormitories or off-campus student housing across the nation, according to Campus Firewatch, an online newsletter.{{when|date=March 2016}} Campus Firewatch's publisher, Ed Comeau, said a January 2000 fire at Seton Hall University in New Jersey drew attention to the perils of fire on campus. A common area in a Seton Hall dorm caught fire after two students ignited a banner from a bulletin board. The fire quickly spread to furniture and killed three students and injured 58 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/08/06/new_coatings_cut_risk_of_a_dorm_fire/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=New coatings cut risk of a dorm fire | date=2007-08-06 | author=Amy Farnsworth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, fire retardants are dropped from aircraft or applied by ground crews around a [[wildfire]]'s edges in an effort to contain its spread.  This allows ground crews time to work to extinguish the fire. However, when needed, retardant can also be dropped directly onto flames to cool the fire and reduce flame length.&lt;ref name=redbook17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nifc.gov/red_book/2007/Chapter17.pdf |title=Interagency Standards for Fire and Aviation Operations 2007, Chapter 17 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |format=PDF |publisher=National Interagency Fire Center |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013524/http://www.nifc.gov/red_book/2007/Chapter17.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aerial firefighting====
{{See also|Aerial firefighting}}
Aerial firefighting is a method to combat wildfires using aircraft. The types of aircraft used include fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Smokejumpers and rappellers are also classified as aerial firefighters, being delivered by parachute from a variety of fixed-wing aircraft, or rappelling from helicopters. Chemicals used to fight fires may include water, water enhancers, or specially-formulated fire retardants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/fire/wfcs/index.htm|title=USDA Forest Service Wildland Fire Chemicals|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fishing license''' (US), '''fishing licence''' or '''fishing permit''' is a regulatory or legal mechanism to control [[fishing]]. Licensing is one mechanism of [[fisheries management]] and may be required for either [[commercial fishing|commercial]] or [[recreational fishing]].

==Historical licensing==

In 1765, the Chinese [[Qing dynasty]] government required all fishing boat operators to obtain a fishing license under the ''aojia'' system that regulated coastal populations. The [[Tanka people|Dan]] boat people of [[Guangdong]] had to acquire a fishing license as early as 1729. The wooden license issued by the government was to be displayed on the bow or stern of a boat. The information on the license consisted of the name and age of the boat's owner, the ship's status as either a fishing or commercial vessel, the home port of the boat, crew and family members on board, the date the license was issued, and the registration number of the license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Antony|first1=Robert J.|title=Elusive Pirates, Pervasive Smugglers Violence and Clandestine Trade in the Greater China Seas|year=2010|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=9789888028115|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types by country==
Depending on the jurisdiction, licenses or permits may be required by a government, a property owner, or both.

===United Kingdom===
The  government requires a [[fishing rod|rod]] licence for anyone over the age of 12 who fishes in [[England]], [[Wales]] or the [[River Esk, Dumfries and Galloway|Border Esk]] area in [[Scotland]] for [[salmon]], [[trout]], freshwater fish, [[smelt (fish)|smelt]] or [[eel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/recreation/fishing/38081.aspx |title=Rod Fishing Licence - Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Environment Agency |location=UK |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, anyone who fishes in a non-[[estuarine]] [[stream]], [[lake]], or [[canal]] needs a permit from the owner of the fishing rights to the water body, which might be a local [[angling club]], a landowner with [[riparian right]]s, or an organization such as the [[Canal &amp; River Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/contact-us/faqs/fishing |title=FAQs about fishing at the Canal &amp; River Trust|publisher=Canal &amp; River Trust |location=UK |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], rights to fish in non-tidal freshwater also are owned either by the government or by private entities such as angling club. The ownership of fishing rights in Ireland derives from the [[Plantations of Ireland|confiscation of lands]] by the [[British Crown]] in the 17th century; the boundaries of fishing rights areas typically follow the boundaries of estates granted by the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fisheriesireland.ie/State-Fisheries/history-of-fishing-rights-in-ireland.html |title=History of fishing rights in Ireland |publisher=Inland Fisheries Ireland |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The U.S. state of [[Oregon]] instituted a requirement for commercial fishing licenses in 1899, the same year that the state's [[sturgeon]] fishery had collapsed due to over-harvesting. Oregon began requiring recreational fishing licenses in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/history.asp |title=ODFW History, 1792 - 2000 |publisher=Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Indiana]] began issuing [[hunting license]]s in 1901 and added fishing privileges to its hunting license in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/dnr/fishwild/5446.htm |title=History of Fish &amp; Wildlife |publisher=Indiana Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[Pennsylvania]] first issued recreational fishing licenses in 1919. Licenses were required only for nonresidents, and only 50 licenses were issued that first year. In 1922, when the state first required licenses for state residents, over 2,700 nonresident licenses and over 200,000 resident licenses were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fishandboat.com/licsal2.htm |title=Pennsylvania Fishing License Sales, 1919 to Present |publisher=Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== License free fishing ==
Some countries don't require a license for recreational sea fishing, provided that certain rules in regard to fish size, numbers and total catch are followed.

=== Belgium ===
Recreational fishing in the sea does not require a license in certain spots. Size limits need to be followed. Also need to have a freshwater permit when fishing on certain seadocks&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cefas.co.uk/publications/files/sportsfishing-c2362.pdf|title=EU contract FISH/2004/011 on "Sport Fisheries" (or Marine Recreational Fisheries) in the EU|last=Pawson|first=M.

=== Cyprus ===
Sea angling and spear fishing without diving equipment is allowed with no licence. Multiple species including seals, dolphins and turtles are protected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Estonia ===
Estonians have a life-long right to fish with one simple hand line in waters owned by the state and local governments, provided that regulations about species, sizes and seasons are followed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
No license is necessary for recreational sea fishing. There are many detailed regulations about fish species, size limits, fishing methods and prohibited areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nzfishing.com/AboutFishingInNZ/SaltWaterFishinginNZ.htm|title=New Zealand Saltwater Fly Fishing-Sea and saltwater fly fishing in New Zealand-nzfishing|website=nzfishing.com|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blueseafishing.co.nz/faq.htm|title=FAQ's about New Zealand Fishing Holidays in the Bay of Islands with Blue Sea Charters|website=www.blueseafishing.co.nz|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Sea fishing from the coast and from the boat is free for both residents and visitors, although there are minimum fish rules and other regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitnorway.com/things-to-do/great-outdoors/fishing/sea-fishing/|title=Sea fishing|last=|first=|date=|website=Official travel guide to Norway|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
For fishing in public waters no license is necessary. Foreign citizens are allowed to fish without license only with hand gear. License free fishing is legal along the sea coast (in many cases also on private land along the coast) and in Sweden's five largest lakes – [[Vänern]], [[Vättern]], [[Hjälmaren]], [[Mälaren]] and [[Storsjön]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swedenfishing.com/fishing_nature/fishing_rules|title=Fishing rules &amp; ecological angling {{!}} SwedenFishing|website=www.swedenfishing.com|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://relaxfishingsweden.com/en/sport-fishing/sea/|title=The Sea - Relax Fishing Sweden|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swedishepa.se/Enjoying-nature/The-Right-of-Public-Access/This-is-allowed/Hunting-and-fishing/|title=Hunting and fishing|website=Swedish Environmental Protection Agency|language=en|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flood levy''' was a temporary reconstruction tax that will fund the reconstruction of Queensland, Australia, following the [[2010–2011 Queensland floods]]. The proposal passed Parliament on 22 March 2011. This levy will apply to everyone who has a taxable income of more than $50,000 a year, and will come into effect from 1 July 2011. Preliminary estimates, following consultation with the Queensland Government, have concluded that the Commonwealth Government will have to invest in $5.6 billion, in rebuilding flood-affected regions. Two thirds of that price will be delivered through budget cuts.

==Passing the Parliament==
The Flood Recovery Levy passed the Parliament on 22 March 2011. The bill passed the [[Australian House of Representatives]] with government support by [[Andrew Wilkie]], [[Bob Katter]], [[Tony Crook (politician)|Tony Crook]], and [[Adam Bandt]]. The [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] Coalition Opposition opposed the bill. The bill proceeded to the Senate, with [[Family First Party|Family First]] Senator [[Steve Fielding]] and independent [[Nick Xenophon]] supporting the proposal. Under a deal with Senator Xenophon, the government will rewrite the terms of the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements to ensure state and territory governments take out disaster insurance or establish an equivalent fund.

==Measures for delivering funding==
The Gillard Government plans to deliver the funding primarily through spending cuts, which will raise approximately $2.8 billion. The Government will cut green programs such as the Green Car Innovation Fund, the Cleaner Car Rebate Scheme, and other programs. A further $1 billion will be raised through delaying major infrastructure projects around Australia. While the last $1.8 billion will be raised by funds received through the flood recovery levy. This levy does not apply to anyone directly affected by the disaster.

==Background==

During the [[First World War]], through orders in council under the [[War Measures Act]], the federal government of Canada maintained strict control on the supply and price of goods. After the war ended, these controls were continued in certain key sectors, including newsprint, under an order in council made on 20 December 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Order in Council, 20 December 1919|pages = 1928{{endash}}1929|url = http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=14649&amp;image_id_nbr=924361&amp;f=g&amp;PHPSESSID=n5v7ha99gnpha33n4q3ge8d605|publisher = ''[[Canada Gazette]]''|date = 1919-12-27|accessdate = 2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controls on the supply and price of paper had been vested in the Paper Control Tribunal under an order in council made on 16 September 1918, and the [[Parliament of Canada]] subsequently passed an act in 1919 to place the Tribunal on a statutory footing, in order for it to complete its work on all outstanding issues arising prior to the declaration of peace.

The ''[[Winnipeg Free Press|Manitoba Free Press]]'', a Winnipeg newspaper publisher, purchased paper from Fort Frances Pulp and Paper. Orders made by the Paper Control Tribunal on 8 July 1920 provided for a reduction of the price that had been paid, representing margins in excess of the regulated price. The ''Manitoba Free Press'' brought an action against Fort Frances in the [[Supreme Court of Ontario]] to recover the specified amount. Fort Frances counterclaimed for an amount equal to the market price of the paper, less sums already paid.

==The courts below==

At the Trial Division, [[William Renwick Riddell|Riddell J]] gave judgment for the plaintiffs, holding that the orders of the Tribunal were valid. The counterclaim was consequentially dismissed. He also noted that "all the powers of the Minister, Controller and Tribunal were ''[[intra vires]]'' and valid, even in a state of profound peace."

The trial judge's ruling was upheld on appeal to the Appellate Division, although they considered that the question was one of contract, as Fort Frances had issued invoices at the specified prices and the ''Free Press'' had paid them, on the basis that the prices were provisional and subject to orders to be made by the Paper Control Tribunal. As a result, it was not necessary to question the validity of those orders.

Fort Frances appealed the ruling to the Privy Council.

==At the Privy Council==

The judgment was upheld, although the Board said they preferred the trial judge's reasoning to that of the appeal court. However, they did not necessarily agree with Riddell J's view as to how far the federal power could extend.

[[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Viscount Haldane]] held that it was not in the Board's power to determine if there was a "national emergency" {{emdash}} it is entirely in the authority of Parliament to determine its existence. Relying on its recent ruling in the ''[[Board of Commerce case]]'', he stated that an emergency is determined by common sense, thus World War I was clearly a "national emergency" and was sufficient reason to invoke the "emergency doctrine":

{{quote|
That the basic instrument on which the character of the entire constitution depends should be construed as providing for such centralised power in an emergency situation follows from the manifestation in the language of the Act of the principle that the instrument has among its purposes to provide for the State
regarded as a whole, and for the expression and influence of its public opinion as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fort Frances|1923|p=704}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Nonetheless, any use of the emergency power must be temporary. However, it was for the federal government to decide when the state of emergency was over, and as such,

{{quote|
...very clear evidence that the crisis has wholly passed away would be required to justify the judiciary, even when the question raised was one of ''[[ultra vires]]'' which it had to decide, in overruling the decision of the Government that exceptional measures were still requisite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fort Frances|1923|p=706}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In that regard, the Board agreed with a recent ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on the question,&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co.'', {{ussc|source= j|251|146|1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is notable as being the first of only two times that the Board cited the decisions of that court.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marx|1970|p=60}}.The only other occasion was in {{cite BAILII|litigants=The Attorney General of Ontario v The Reciprocal Insurers having no licences under the Dominion Insurance Act and others ("Reciprocal Insurers case")|link= |court=UKPC|year=1924|num=5|date=25 January 1924|pinpoint=338|parallelcite = [1924] A.C. 328|courtname=[[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|P.C.]]|juris=Ontario|format = 1}}, citing ''[[Hammer v. Dagenhart]]'', {{ussc|source= j|247|251|1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

This decision, like many others of its time, completely ignored the "national concern" doctrine established earlier in ''[[Russell v. The Queen]]'', but it was significant in explaining how far the "emergency doctrine" could extend in times of emergency, effectively incorporating the principle of ''[[Salus populi est suprema lex]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deschênes|1992|p=1187}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Haldane noted,

{{quote|
•.. it does not follow that in a very different case, such as that of sudden danger to social order arising from the outbreak of a great war, the Parliament of the Dominion cannot act under other powers which may well be implied in the constitution. The reasons given in the ''Board of Commerce Case'' recognize exceptional cases where such a power may be implied.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fort Frances|1923|p=703}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Therefore, in time of an emergency, provincial powers can be overridden for the peace, order and good government of Canada as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marx|1970|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the discretion given to the Parliament of Canada as to how long an emergency continues was exercised again in the period following the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marx|1970|p=64}}, noting the passage of ''The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act'', S.C. 1945, c. 25, and ''The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act'', S.C. 1947, c. 16..&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17088">'''Gross income''' is all a person's receipts and gains from all sources, before any deductions. The adjective "gross", as opposed to "net", generally qualifies a word referring to an amount, value, weight, number, or the like, specifying that necessary deductions have not been taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|gross|id=81765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In United States income tax law, gross income serves as the starting point for determining Federal and state income tax of individuals, corporations, estates and trusts, whether resident or non-resident.&lt;ref&gt;Resident individuals and corporations are allowed [[tax deductions]]. Nonresident individuals and corporations are both allowed deductions from gross income.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Code]], "Except as otherwise provided" by law, gross income means "all income from whatever source derived," and is not limited to cash received.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., 26 USC 83, regarding taxation of certain transfers of property in connection with the performance of services.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal tax regulations interpret this general rule. The amount of income recognized is generally the value received or the value which the taxpayer has a right to receive. Certain types of income are specifically excluded from gross income for tax purposes.

The time at which gross income becomes taxable is determined under Federal tax rules, which differ in some cases from financial accounting rules.

===What is income===
Individuals, corporations, members of partnerships, estates, trusts, and their beneficiaries ("taxpayers") are subject to [[income tax in the United States]].  The amount on which tax is computed, [[taxable income]], equals gross [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/pt02.html income] less allowable [[tax deductions]].

The Internal Revenue Code gives specific examples.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61- 26 USC 61].&lt;/ref&gt; The examples are not all inclusive. The term "income" is not defined in the statute or regulations. An early [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case stated, "Income may be defined as the gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined, provided it is understood to include profit gained through a sale or conversion of capital assets."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Eisner v. Macomber]]'', 40 S.Ct. 189 (1920). This case and later cases adopted an accounting concept of income. For a definition of economic income, see [[Haig-Simons income]]. See Willis|Hoffman 2009 chapters 4, and 5 and Pratt &amp; Kulsrud 2009 chapters 5 and 6, cited below, for a discussion of gross income.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also held that the amount of gross income on disposition of property is the proceeds less the basis (usually, the acquisition cost) of the property.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co.]]'', 38 S.Ct. 467, 247 U.S. 179 (1918).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gross income is not limited to cash received.  "It includes income realized in any form, whether money, property, or services."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.2.1&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.61-1(a)].  The courts have rejected arguments by various [[tax protesters]] have [[tax protester arguments|argued]] that some types of income are not included in this broad definition.  Where property or services are received in exchange for property, use of property, services, or use of money, the fair market value of the property or services received is included in gross income.  See, [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.2.7&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.61-6], [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:11.0.1.1.1.0.2.1&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.1001-1], [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.2.2&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.61-2(d)(1)].  For examples, see, ''e.g.'', Rev. Rul. 79-24, 1979 1 C.B. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following are some of the things that are included in income:
*'''Wages''', fees for services, tips, and similar income.  It is well established that income from personal services must be included in the gross income of the person who performs the services.  Mere assignment of the income does not shift the liability for the tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.2.2&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.61-2].  See, ''e.g.'', ''Lucas v. Earl'', 50 S. Ct. 241, in which Mr. Earl's income that he assigned to his wife was taxed to him.  In four [[community property]] states, however, income is considered jointly earned by a husband and wife. See Willis|Hoffman 2009 page 4-18 ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Interest]]''' received,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.2.8&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.61-7].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as imputed interest on below market and gift loans.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7873- 26 USC 7872], Willis|Hoffman 2009 page 4-23 ''et seq''. regarding imputed interest.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Dividends]]''', including capital gain distributions, from corporations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.2.10&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.61-9].  Not all distributions from corporations to shareholders are taxable as dividends.  Distributions in excess of ''earnings and profits'' as well as distributions in complete termination of a shareholder's interest are treated as proceeds on disposition of the shares.  See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/316- 26 USC 316] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/302- 26 USC 302].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gross profit''' from sale of [[inventory]].  The sales price, net of discounts, less [[cost of goods sold]] is included in income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.2.7&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.61-6].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gains''' on disposition of other property.  Gain is measured as the excess of proceeds over the taxpayer's [[adjusted basis]] in the property.&lt;ref&gt;26 CFR 1.61-6, ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Losses from property may be allowed as [[tax deductions]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/165- 26 USC 165].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Rents''' and '''[[royalties]]''' from use of tangible or intangible property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.2.9&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.61-8].&lt;/ref&gt;  The full amount of rent or royalty is included in income, and expenses incurred to produce this income may be allowed as tax deductions.&lt;ref&gt;For such deductions, see [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/212- 26 USC 212].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Alimony]]''' and separate maintenance payments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.2.11&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.61-10].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Pensions]]''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.2.12&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.61-11].&lt;/ref&gt; annuities,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/72- 26 USC 72], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/402- 26 USC 402], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/403- 26 USC 403], and regulations thereunder.&lt;/ref&gt; and income from life insurance or endowment contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Certain amounts received from some types of retirement accounts constitute income only when basis in the account has been recovered.  For an overview, see IRS Publication 17, Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Distributive share of '''[[partnership]]''' income&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/702- 26 USC 702]&lt;/ref&gt; or pro rata share of income of an '''[[S corporation]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1366- 26 USC 1366].&lt;/ref&gt;
*State and local '''income tax refunds''', to the extent previously deducted.  Note that these are generally excluded from gross income for state and local income tax purposes.
*Any other income from whatever source.  Even income from [[crime]]s is taxable and ''must'' be reported, as failure to do so is a crime in itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Rutkin v. United States'', {{ussc|343|130|1952}}; [[James v. United States (1961)|James v. United States, 366 U.S. 213 (1961)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifts and inheritances are not considered income to the recipient under U.S. law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/102- 26 USC 102].&lt;/ref&gt;  However, gift or estate tax may be imposed on the donor or the estate of the decedent.

===Year of inclusion===
A taxpayer must include Income as part of taxable income in the year recognized under the taxpayer's [[Comparison of Cash Method and Accrual Method of accounting|method of accounting]].  Generally, a taxpayer using the cash method of accounting (cash basis taxpayer) recognizes income when received.  A taxpayer using the accrual method (accrual basis taxpayer) recognizes income when earned.  Income is generally considered earned:
*on sales of property when title to the property passes to the customer, and
*on performance of services when the services are performed

===Amount of Income===
For a cash method taxpayer, the measure of income is generally the amount of money or fair market value of property received. For an accrual method taxpayer, it includes the amount the taxpayer has a right to receive.&lt;ref&gt;Willis|Hoffman 2009 page 4-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain specific rules apply, including:
*Constructive receipt,
*Deferral of income from advance payment for goods or services (with exceptions),
*Determination what portion of an annuity is income and what portion is return of capital,

The value of goods or services received is included in income in [[barter]] transactions.

===Exclusions from gross income: U.S. Federal income tax law===
The courts have given very broad meaning to the phrase "all income from whatever source derived," interpreting it to include all income unless a specific exclusion applies.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'' the Supreme Court's broad discussion in [[Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.]], 328 U.S. 426 (1955), which includes a discussion of numerous other cases on point.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain types of income are specifically excluded from gross income. These may be referred to as exempt income, exclusions, or [[tax exemption]]s. Among the more common excluded items&lt;ref&gt;For a basic discussion, see Willis|Hoffman 2009 Chapter 5.  For a list of common exclusions, see the Index to IRS Publication 17 under "Exclusions from gross income".&lt;/ref&gt; are the following:
*Tax exempt interest. For Federal income tax, interest on state and municipal bonds is excluded from gross income.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/103- 26 USC 103].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states provide an exemption from state income tax for certain bond interest.
*Some Social Security benefits. The amount exempt has varied by year. The exemption is phased out for individuals with gross income above certain amounts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/86- 26 USC 86].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gifts and inheritances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/102- 26 USC 102].  To qualify as a gift, there must be donative intent.  See ''Estate of D. R. Daly'', 3 BTA 1042 (1926).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a "gift" from an employer to an employee is considered compensation, and is generally included in gross income.
*Life insurance proceeds received by reason of the death of the insured person.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/101- 26 USC 101].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Certain compensation for personal physical injury or physical sickness, including:
**Amounts received under worker’s compensation acts for personal physical injuries or physical sickness,
**Amounts received as damages (other than punitive damages) in a suit or settlement for personal physical injuries or physical sickness,
**Amounts received through insurance for personal physical injuries or physical sickness, and
**Amounts received as a pension, annuity, or similar allowance for personal physical injuries or physical sickness resulting from active service in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/104- 26 USC 104].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scholarships. Amounts in the nature of compensation, such as for teaching, are included in gross income.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/117- 26 USC 117].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Certain employee benefits. Non-taxable benefits include group [[health insurance]], group [[life insurance]] for policies up to $50,000, and certain fringe benefits, including those under a flexible spending or [[cafeteria plan]].&lt;ref&gt;Numerous provisions apply; see [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_B_40_III.html 26 USC 120-135].  See, ''e.g.'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/125- 26 USC 125] on cafeteria plans.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Certain elective deferrals of salary (contributions to "401(k)" plans). 
*Meals and lodging provided to employees on employer premises for the convenience of the employer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/119- 26 USC 119].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Foreign earned income exclusion for U.S. citizens or residents for income earned outside the U.S. when the individual met qualifying tests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/911- 26 USC 911].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Income from discharge of indebtedness for insolvent taxpayers or in certain other cases.&lt;ref&gt;[26 USC 108].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Contributions to capital received by a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/118- 26 USC 118].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gain up to $250,000 ($500,000 on a married joint tax return) on the sale of a personal residence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/121- 26 USC 121].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous other specific exclusions. Restrictions and specific definitions apply.

Some state rules provide for different inclusions and exclusions.&lt;ref&gt;For example, New Jersey requires that wages include contributions to 401(k) plans that are excluded for Federal purposes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source of income===

United States persons (including citizens, residents (whether U.S. citizens or aliens residing in the United States), and U.S. corporations) are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax on their worldwide income. Nonresident aliens are subject to U.S. federal income tax only on income from a U.S. business and certain income from United States sources. [[International taxation#Source of income|Source of income]] is determined based on the type of income. The source of compensation income is the place where the services giving rise to the income were performed. The source of certain income, such as dividends and interest, is based on location of the residence of the payor. The source of income from property is based on the location where the property is used. Significant additional rules apply.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_N_40_I.html 26 USC 861 through 865].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taxation of nonresident aliens====
Nonresident aliens are subject to regular income tax on income from a U.S. business or for services performed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/872- 26 USC 872] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/882- 26 USC 882].&lt;/ref&gt; Nonresident aliens are subject to a flat rate of U.S. income tax on certain enumerated types of U.S. source income, generally collected as a [[withholding tax]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/871- 26 USC 871] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/881- 26 USC 881].&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of tax is 30% of the gross income, unless reduced by a [[tax treaty]]. Nonresident aliens are subject to U.S. federal income tax on some, but not all capital gains.&lt;ref&gt;See generally subsection (a), paragraph (2) of 26 USC 871.&lt;/ref&gt; Wages may be treated as effectively connected income, or may be subject to the flat 30% tax, depending on the facts and circumstances.

The ''Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth'', or ''Digital Opportunity - A review of Intellectual Property and Growth'', was an independent review of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[intellectual property]] (IP) system, focusing on [[UK copyright law]]. Professor [[Ian Hargreaves]] was commissioned to chair a review of how the IP framework supports economic growth and innovation in November 2010 by [[Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]]. The review was published in May 2011 and made 10 recommendations to "ensure that the UK has an IP framework best suited to supporting innovation and promoting economic growth in the digital age".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = Independent Review of IP and Growth homepage| url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview.htm| accessdate = 14 August 2011| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130112213030/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview.htm| archivedate = 12 January 2013| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hargreaves assembled a panel of five experts to serve as an advisory panel, including Roger Burt, [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], Mark Schankerman, [[David Gann]] and Tom Loosemore.

== Findings of the review ==
According to the Hargreaves review, the frequency of major IP reviews in the UK indicated the shortcomings of the UK system. There had been four major IP reviews in the past six years, and of the 54 recommendations of the 2006 [[Gowers Review of Intellectual Property]] only 25 had been implemented. According to the Hargreaves review, "on copyright issues, lobbying on behalf of rights owners has been more persuasive to Ministers than economic impact assessments." Therefore, the Hargreaves review took on board the importance of having an IP framework which adapts well to change in technology and markets as a guiding theme. The Hargreaves review found that IP [[Policy making|policymaking]] in the UK is not [[Evidence-based policy|evidence-based]], a criticism that had already been made in the 1970s by the [[Banks Review]] and the 2006 Gowers Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hargreaves| first = Prof Ian| title = Digital Opportunity – A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth| publisher = UK Intellectual Property Office| date = May 2011| pages =6 | url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreword to the review, Professor Hargreaves summarised what he calls "David Cameron's exam question" as "Could it be true that laws designed more than three centuries ago with the express purpose of creating economic incentives for innovation by protecting creators' rights are today obstructing innovation and economic growth?" "The short answer is: yes", Hargreaves wrote, concluding that "the UK's intellectual property framework, especially with regard to copyright, is falling behind what is needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hargreaves| first = Prof Ian| title = Digital Opportunity – A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth| publisher = UK Intellectual Property Office| date = May 2011| pages =1 | url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the review intellectual property (IP) policy is an increasingly important tool for stimulating [[economic growth]]. However, the proliferating use of IP rights can increase IP [[transaction costs]] and prevent small innovative companies from entering the market. Digital [[creative industries]] rank third in UK [[exports]], behind advanced engineering and financial and professional services. According to the review the further global growth of these businesses required an efficient digital market in the UK in which copyright is [[license|licensed]] speedily and effectively. The review noted the need for IP law to adapt to change as digital communication technology involves the routine copying of text, images and data. However, it found that the IP framework had fallen behind and acted as a [[regulatory barrier]] to the creation of new internet based businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hargreaves| first = Prof Ian| title = Digital Opportunity – A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth| publisher = UK Intellectual Property Office| date = May 2011| pages =3 | url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review concluded that in order to allow the UK [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|Intellectual Property Office]] (IPO) to support innovation and promote economic growth on the basis of evidence, institutional changes needed to be made. It recommended that for the first time since its creation as the Patent Office, the IPO should be given an overarching legal mandate to pursue economic objectives, and the powers necessary to make evidence-based recommendations, to, for example, the UK [[Antitrust law in the European Union|competition authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hargreaves| first = Prof Ian| title = Digital Opportunity – A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth| publisher = UK Intellectual Property Office| date = May 2011| pages =7 | url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Copyright licensing ===
The review noted that numerous respondents to the review's call for evidence made submissions regarding the defects in [[copyright licensing]], including the [[Confederation of British Industry|CBI]], [[News International]], [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]], [[Reed Elsevier]], UK photographers, and the [[European Publishers Council]]. On the basis of these submissions, the review concluded that there was a need to make it easier for large and small copyright owners to sell licences in their work and for others to buy them. Market transactions needed to be faster, more automated and cheaper, in order to establish a UK market in digital copyright where disputes are readily resolved without costly litigation. Easier cross-border licensing in the EU and bulk licensing of digital content through [[collective rights management]] by [[collecting societies]] could allow the UK to build its competitive advantage and become the centre for IP matters in the European time zone, the review speculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hargreaves| first = Prof Ian| title = Digital Opportunity – A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth| publisher = UK Intellectual Property Office| date = May 2011| pages =4 | url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Copyright exceptions ===
The review also urged the UK Government to "take long overdue action to update copyright law in ways designed to increase consumer confidence in the way the law works". According to the review scientific [[data and text mining]] techniques were prohibited by [[UK copyright law]]. Noting that the UK had chosen not to implement all [[copyright exceptions]] permitted under EU law, the review drew attention to the fact that UK copyright law did not allow individuals to "shift the format of a piece of music or video for personal use", to make use of a copyrighted work in [[parody]], and nor did UK copyright law allow libraries to archive all digital copyright material. Taking full advantage of the EU-sanctioned exceptions would, according to the review, bring cultural and economic benefits, as well as making copyright law better understood and more acceptable to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hargreaves| first = Prof Ian| title = Digital Opportunity – A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth| publisher = UK Intellectual Property Office| date = May 2011| pages =4 | url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the review "the copyright regime cannot be considered fit for the digital age when millions of citizens are in daily breach of copyright, simply for shifting a piece of music or video from one device to another. People are confused about what is allowed and what is not, with the risk that the law falls into disrepute." According to the review the UK could achieve many of the benefits of the US [[fair use]] doctrine by fully implementing the copyright exceptions permitted under EU law. In order to future-proof copyright law so that it accommodated future technological developments and activities which do not threaten the interest of copyright owners, the review argued that the UK should argue for additional copyright exceptions at EU level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hargreaves| first = Prof Ian| title = Digital Opportunity – A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth| publisher = UK Intellectual Property Office| date = May 2011| pages =5 | url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Copyright infringement ===
Reviewing UK and international research on the level of [[copyright infringement]], the review found "that very little of it is supported by transparent research criteria. Meanwhile sales and profitability in most creative business sectors appear to be holding up relatively well." The review concludes that many creative businesses are experiencing turbulences due to digital copyright infringement, "but that at the level of the whole economy, measurable impacts are not as stark as is sometimes suggested." Existing research indicated that tougher enforcement alone will not solve the problem of copyright infringement and the review recommended that the UK Government should respond in four ways: by modernising copyright law, through education, through enforcement and by doing all it can to encourage open and competitive markets in licensed digital content to increase legitimate digital content at prices which appeal to consumers. According to the review "strong online enforcement measures made possible by the [[Digital Economy Act 2010]] should be carefully monitored so that the approach can be adjusted in the light of evidence". The review acknowledged the importance of smaller companies to innovation and job creation, and concluded that the advice and information provided to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) on IP was insufficient. The review recommended that SMEs should be given access to lower cost IP advice, and recommended the establishment of a [[small claims track]] for copyright to better resolve the many lower-value IP disputes involving SMEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hargreaves| first = Prof Ian| title = Digital Opportunity – A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth| publisher = UK Intellectual Property Office| date = May 2011| pages =6 | url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Patents and design ===
The review also found that the UK patent and design system needs to adapt to changing circumstances. According to the review, technological developments and a very strong growth in the levels of patenting, especially in computer programs and telecommunications, has led to the emergence of so-called ''[[patent thickets]]'' which obstruct entry to markets and hinder innovation. The growing design sector is the largest source of intangible investment in the UK economy and the emergence of [[three dimensional space|3D]] printing has increased the need for a thorough reassessment of IP and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hargreaves| first = Prof Ian| title = Digital Opportunity – A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth| publisher = UK Intellectual Property Office| date = May 2011| pages =5 | url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Recommendations ====
# '''Evidence''': "Government should ensure that development of the IP System is driven as far as possible by objective evidence. Policy should balance measurable economic objectives against social goals and potential benefits for rights holders against impacts on consumers and other interests. These concerns will be of particular importance in assessing future claims to extend rights or in determining desirable limits to rights."
# '''International priorities''': "The UK should resolutely pursue its international interests in IP, particularly with respect to emerging economies such as China and India, based upon positions grounded in economic evidence. It should attach the highest immediate priority to achieving a unified EU patent court and EU patent system, which promises significant economic benefits to UK business. The UK should work to make the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] a more effective vehicle for international processing of patent applications."
# '''Copyright licensing''': "In order to boost UK firms’ access to transparent, contestable and global digital markets, the UK should establish a cross sectoral Digital Copyright Exchange. Government should appoint a senior figure to oversee its design and implementation by the end of 2012. A range of incentives and disincentives will be needed to encourage rights holders and others to take part. Governance should reflect the interests of participants, working to an agreed code of practice. The UK should support moves by the European Commission to establish a framework for cross border copyright licensing, with clear benefits to the UK as a major exporter of copyright works. [[Collecting societies]] should be required by law to adopt codes of practice, approved by the IPO and the UK competition authorities, to ensure that they operate in a way that is consistent with the further development of efficient, open markets."
# '''Orphan works''': "The Government should legislate to enable licensing of [[orphan works]]. This should establish [[extended collective licensing]] for mass licensing of orphan works, and a clearance procedure for use of individual works. In both cases, a work should only be treated as an orphan if it cannot be found by search of the databases involved in the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange."
# '''Limits to copyright''': "Government should firmly resist over regulation of activities which do not prejudice the central objective of copyright, namely the provision of incentives to creators. Government should deliver copyright exceptions at national level to realise all the opportunities within the EU framework, including [[format shifting]], parody, non-commercial research, and library archiving. The UK should also promote at EU level an exception to support [[text mining|text]] and [[data analytics]]. The UK should give a lead at EU level to develop a further copyright exception designed to build into the EU framework adaptability to new technologies. This would be designed to allow uses enabled by technology of works in ways which do not directly trade on the underlying creative and expressive purpose of the work. The Government should also legislate to ensure that these and other copyright exceptions are protected from override by contract."
# '''Patent thickets and other obstructions to innovation''': In order to limit the effects of these barriers to innovation, the Government should: take a leading role in promoting international efforts to cut backlogs and manage the boom in patent applications by further extending “work sharing” with patent offices in other countries; work to ensure patents are not extended into sectors, such as non-technical computer programs and business methods, which they do not currently cover, without clear evidence of benefit; investigate ways of limiting adverse consequences of [[patent thickets]], including by working with international partners to establish a patent fee structure set by reference to innovation and growth goals rather than solely by reference to patent office running costs. The structure of patent renewal fees might be adjusted to encourage patentees to assess more carefully the value of maintaining lower value patents, so reducing the density of patent thickets."
# '''The design industry''': The role of IP in supporting this important branch of the creative economy has been neglected. In the next 12 months, the IPO should conduct an evidence based assessment of the relationship between design rights and innovation, with a view to establishing a firmer basis for evaluating policy at the UK and European level. The assessment should include exploration with design interests of whether access to the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange would help creators protect and market their designs and help users better achieve legally compliant access to designs."
# '''Enforcement of IP rights''': "The Government should pursue an integrated approach based upon enforcement, education and, crucially, measures to strengthen and grow legitimate markets in copyright and other IP protected fields. When the enforcement regime set out in the [[Digital Economy Act 2010]] becomes operational next year its impact should be carefully monitored and compared with experience in other countries, in order to provide the insight needed to adjust enforcement mechanisms as market conditions evolve. This is urgent and Ofcom should not wait until then to establish its benchmarks and begin building data on trends. In order to support rights holders in enforcing their rights the Government should introduce a small claims track for low monetary value IP claims in the Patents County Court."
# '''Small firm access to IP advice''': "The IPO should draw up plans to improve accessibility of the IP system to smaller companies who will benefit from it. This should involve access to lower cost providers of integrated IP legal and commercial advice."
# '''An IP system responsive to change''': The IPO should be given the necessary powers and mandate in law to ensure that it focuses on its central task of ensuring that the UK’s IP system promotes innovation and growth through efficient, contestable markets. It should be empowered to issue statutory opinions where these will help clarify copyright law. As an element of improved transparency and adaptability, Government should ensure that by the end of 2013, the IPO publishes an assessment of the impact of those measures advocated in this review which have been accepted by Government.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hargreaves| first = Prof Ian| title = Digital Opportunity – A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth| publisher = UK Intellectual Property Office| date = May 2011| pages =8–9 | url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UK government response ==
On 3 August 2011, the [[UK government]] endorsed the recommendations of the review.&lt;ref name=Response&gt;http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipresponse-full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation of recommendations ===
{{Update-section|date=May 2015}}

The government announced that it would make arrangements to establish a Digital Copyright Exchange to facilitate copyright licensing and that the exchange would operate as a "genuine marketplace independent of sellers and purchasers" like amazon.com. Previously the government said that the progress report is to be published by end 2011 and the exchange should be set up by the end of 2012. However, while the exchange, now known as [[Copyright Hub]], was established as a limited company in 2013, {{Asof|2015|May|lc = y}} it is yet to be up and running, and the expected launch date is now 2016.

The government said that will not run the exchange, it will make works subject to [[Crown copyright]] available through the exchange and will encourage public bodies to do likewise. The [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills]] [[Vince Cable]] announced at the 3 August press conference that a "champion" would be appointed to lead the work. According to the government implementing the [[copyright exceptions]] permitted under the [[InfoSoc Directive]] would be beneficial and those copyright exceptions should not be undermined by contracts. Proposals for a limited private copying exception, an exception for [[parody]], and broader exceptions for non-commercial research and library archiving in [[UK copyright law]] were to be published in autumn 2011.&lt;ref name="Managing IP"&gt;[http://www.managingip.com/Article/2878040/Five-highlights-from-Hargreaves.html Managing IP] {{cite news | title = 5 Highlights from Hargreaves | date = 3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The government announced that proposals for the commercial and cultural uses of [[orphan works]], works for which the copyright owner is not known or cannot be traced, would also be published in autumn 2011. Safeguards for the protection of copyright owners, such as a requirement for a diligent search, licensing at market rates and provisions for copyright owners who come forward at a later stage, are to be put in place. The government announced that it would respond to "concerns" about [[collecting societies]] and in order to promote good practice minimum standards for voluntary codes would be published early 2012. A "backstop power" was to be made available where a collecting society has failed to introduce or meet the minimum standards. The government also committed to introducing a small claims track in the [[Patents County Court]] (PCC), which is to be renamed the Intellectual Property County Court, for cases worth less than £5,000 ($8,000). The small claims track would be designed to provide access to the courts in straightforward, low-value disputes, and should particularly benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in relation to copyright, design and possibly trade mark cases.&lt;ref name="Managing IP"/&gt;

In December 2012, the government published "Modernising Copyright," which provided clear statements of the government's intent with regard to amending copyright law.&lt;ref name=Modernising&gt;https://ipo.gov.uk/response-2011-copyright-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the final drafts of the resulting [[Statutory Instrument]]s were laid before Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Current status of Statutory Instruments, including the drafts in question, as of 29 March 2014: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmsilist/section-e.htm#e-1&lt;/ref&gt; The changes had been approved thereafter and went into effect in June 2014 and October 2014 respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3220">'''Judicial councils''' are panels of the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|United States federal courts]] that are charged with making "necessary and appropriate orders for the effective and expeditious administration of justice" within their circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|28|332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among their responsibilities is judicial discipline, the formulation of circuit policy, the implementation of policy directives received from the [[Judicial Conference of the United States]], and the annual submission of a report to the [[Administrative Office of the United States Courts]] on the number and nature of orders entered during the year that relate to judicial misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|28|332(g)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[United States federal judicial circuits|US judicial circuit]] has a judicial council, which consists of the chief judge of the circuit and an equal number of circuit judges and district judges of the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|28|332(a)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judicial discipline ==
The judicial discipline process of [[United States federal judge|US federal judge]]s is initiated by the filing of a complaint by any person alleging that a judge has engaged in conduct "prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts, or alleging that such judge is unable to discharge all the duties of the office by reason of mental or physical disability."&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|28|351(a)}}. ''See generally'' {{usctc|28|16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the chief judge of the circuit does not dismiss the complaint or conclude the proceedings, then he or she must promptly appoint himself or herself, along with equal numbers of circuit judges and district judges, to a special committee to investigate the facts and allegations in the complaint. The committee must conduct such investigation as it finds necessary and then expeditiously file a comprehensive written report of its investigation with the judicial council of the circuit involved. Upon receipt of such a report, the judicial council of the circuit involved may conduct any additional investigation it deems necessary, and it may dismiss the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|28|354(a)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a judge who is the subject of a complaint holds his or her office during good behavior, action taken by the judicial council may include certifying disability of the judge. The judicial council may also, in its discretion, refer any complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 351, along with the record of any associated proceedings and its recommendations for appropriate action, to the Judicial Conference. The Judicial Conference may exercise its authority under the judicial discipline provisions as a conference, or through a standing committee appointed by the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]].

'''Judicial economy''' is the principle that the limited resources of the legal system or a given court should be conserved by the refusal to decide one or more claims raised in a case. For example, the [[plaintiff]] may claim that the [[defendant]]'s actions violated three distinct laws. Having found for the plaintiff for a violation of the first law, the court then has the discretion to exercise judicial economy and refuse to make a decision on the remaining two claims, on the grounds that the finding of one violation should be sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff.

==Threshold issue in a given case ==
In the presence of a threshold issue that will ultimately decide a case, a court may, depending on the degree of prejudice to the litigants rights, elect to hear that issue rather than proceeding with a full-blown trial.

==Class action lawsuits ==
[[Class action lawsuit]]s are another example of judicial economy in action, as they are often tried as a single case, yet involve many cases with similar facts.&lt;ref name=Wex&gt;{{cite web|title=Class Action|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/class_action|website=Wex Legal Dictionary|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;Rather than trying each case individually, which would unduly burden the judicial system, the cases can be consolidated into a class action.

'''LawMoose,''' launched in September 2000, is believed{{by whom|date=April 2012}} to have been the first U.S. regional legal [[search engine]] operating its own independent [[web crawler]].

Initially LawMoose provided a searchable index drawn from [[Minnesota]] law and government sites. Later, it added a similar capability for [[Wisconsin]] law sites and select general legal reference starting point sites.

LawMoose has since evolved into a hybrid bi-level public and subscription legal knowledge environment, featuring a [[thesaurus]]-based topical map of legal and governmental web resources (which spans the U.S. and globe and adds non-legal resources in a subscriber edition), a list of the largest one hundred Minnesota law firms, ranked by number of Minnesota lawyers, the Minnesota Legal Periodical Index, listing and topically categorizing more than 35,000 thousand articles published in Minnesota legal publications from 1984 to the present (in the public edition), and a densely interconnected, constantly evolving legal words, phrases, concepts and resources network (in a subscriber edition).

LawMoose's legal words, phrases, concepts and resources network consists of more than 305,000 legal, governmental, business, insurance, and popular terms, interconnected through more than 1,276,000 semantic relationships. Interconnections are based on a relationships vocabulary of 300 relationship types. This multi-dimensional intellectual network functions as a navigable intellectual model of law and law practice.

This semantic, intellectual network-based approach to organizing legal knowledge, legal diagnostic and problem solving concepts, law practice processes, and conceptually locating legal and law practice resources is a significant departure from traditional hierarchical, case law-specific legal taxonomies, such as the [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] utilized by the [[West American Digest System]] and from collections of searchable primary law.

The Minnesota Legal Periodical Index has been continuously maintained by the [[Minnesota State Law Library]] since 1984. Since 2002, it has appeared on LawMoose through a collaboration with LawMoose publisher, Pritchard Law Webs, [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]].

&lt;ref name="judicialcouncil.gov.az"&gt;http://www.judicialcouncil.gov.az/Meqaleler/Fikrat_Mammadov_e11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan started reformation of the legal system by the establishing of democratic reforms. This was followed by the adoption of the first [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] in 1995 which is the foundation of the legislative system of the modern country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Azerbaijan.html#_1._The_Legal_System%20of%20the%20Republic&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] creates the system of presidential republic with a [[separation of powers]] among the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of the government in order to prevent abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;ghttp://azerbaijan.az/portal/General/Constitution/doc/constitution_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
The term civil law in Azerbaijan refers to [[private law]], which is opposed to the [[common law]] system of [[Criminal law]] and [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]]. The major body of statutes and laws governing civil law and procedure are set out in the Civil Code of Azerbaijan, established in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azpromo.az/uploads/legislation/Civil_code_eng_51b1e34e863c1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal law==
The current Criminal Code of Azerbaijan came into force in September 2000, replacing the older Criminal Code of 1960 which had been based on the principles of [[Soviet law]].&lt;ref name="llex1"&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/azerbaijan.htm#legislative%20system The Basic Structure of the Azerbaijan Legislative System]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of the Criminal Code states that "the Criminal legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan consists of this Code. New laws defining criminal responsibility are subject to inclusion in this Code";&lt;ref name="llex1"/&gt; this is characteristic of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal systems such as [[France]] and [[Italy]]. In 1998 Azerbaijan was the first country in the Orient to abolish the [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name="judicialcouncil.gov.az"/&gt;

==Sources of law==
Unlike [[common law]] systems such as the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], Azerbaijani courts do not rely extensively on [[case law]] and judicial [[precedent]]. Except for decisions of the [[Constitutional Court]] of Azerbaijan, decisions of the courts are not usually counted as a source of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/azerbaijan.htm#case%20law Case Law in Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; The sources of law in the Azerbaijani legal system are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/azerbaijan.htm#sources%20of%20law Sources of Azerbaijani law]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]].
*Acts adopted via [[referendum]].
*[[Laws]] passed by the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]], Azerbaijan's [[legislature]].
*[[Decree]]s.
*Resolutions of the [[Cabinet of Ministers]].
*International [[treaties]] to which Azerbaijan is a party.

==Court system==
The [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] of Azerbaijan is a supreme judicial body on civil, criminal and other cases related to the execution of general and specialized courts. The [[Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan]] is the supreme body of constitutional justice on the matters attributed to its jurisdiction by the Constitution, with authority to interpret and apply the [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]].

The 1995 constitution provides for public trials in most cases, the presumption of innocence in criminal cases, and a defendant’s right to legal counsel. Both defendants and prosecutors have the right of appeal. In practice, however, the courts are politically oriented, seeming to overlook the government’s human rights violations. In July 1993, [[Heydar Aliyev]] ousted the Supreme Court chief justice because of alleged political loyalties to the opposition. The president directly appoints lower level judges. The president also appoints the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court judges with confirmation by the legislature. Prosecutors (procurators) are appointed by the president with confirmation by the legislature. The [[minister of justice]] organizes prosecutors into offices at the district, municipal, and republic levels. The constitution provides equal status for prosecutors and defense attorneys before the courts, but in practice the arrest and investigatory powers of the prosecutors have dominant influence before the courts. Judges will often remand a case for further prosecutory investigation rather than render an innocent verdict. Investigations often rely on obtaining confessions rather than on gathering evidence.

The Azerbaijan [[Government of Azerbaijan|government’s]] [[human rights]] record is poor, although some public policy debate is allowed and human rights organizations operate. The government restricts freedom of assembly, religion, and association. Numerous cases of arbitrary arrest, beatings (some resulting in deaths), unwarranted searches and seizures, and other human rights abuses are reported. Political oppositionists are harassed and arrested, and there are dozens of political prisoners in Azerbaijan. The conflict between  [[Armenia]]ns and Azerbaijanis contributed to widespread human rights violations by both sides. Some opposition newspapers are allowed to exist.

== Legal Reforms ==
{{Main|Legal reform in Azerbaijan}}
After gaining of independence Azerbaijani legal system has undergone fundamental reforms. An important part of the legal reforms in the country is related to adoption of a new Constitution in Azerbaijan in 1995. Since that Constitution was amended three times in 2002, 2009 and 2016.  Adoption of the Constitution has been followed by reforms related to progressive legislative acts such as, "The Law on Constitutional court", "The Law on Courts and Judges", "The Law on Police", "The Law on Operational-investigational activity", Law Judicial Legal Council, Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes and etc. Moreover, there have been made a number of amendements to the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judicialcouncil.gov.az/e_mehkeme_ve_huquq.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal reforms introduced new three stage - first instance, appelate and supreme court system in Azerbaijan and ensured its independence from other branches of power. At present, there are district (city) courts acts as the first degree of jurisdictional courts, military courts and local administrative-economic courts as territorial jurisdictional courts, also Court of Azerbaijan Republic on Felonies and Court of Azerbaijan on Grave Military Crimes.

The Supreme Court of Azerbaijan Republic is cassation degree of jurisdiction and consists of 4 chambers - Civil Chamber, Criminal Chamber, Military Chamber and Administrative-Economic Chamber. Court hearings are public, and defendants are free to choose their own attorney and have the right to appeal the verdict. In cases involving national security or other defined by law a judge may decide to hold a closed trial.

Azerbaijan as a member of the Council of Europe ratificated [[European Convention on Human Rights]] . Further, Azerbaijani ''individuals, group of individuals and non-governmental organisations'' can refer cases to the ECHR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5833">In the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]], a '''Legal Education Certificate''' is a [[professional certification]] awarded to a person who has completed a course of study and training at a [[law school]] established by the Council of Legal Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clecaribbean.com/treaty.php|title=Agreement Establishing the Council of Legal Education|publisher=Caribbean Council of Legal Education|date=1970|accessdate=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by Articles 4 and 5 of the 1970 Agreement Establishing the Council of Legal Education.&lt;ref name="Agreement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/secretariat/legal_instruments/agreement_cle.jsp?menu=secretariat|title=Agreement Establishing the Council of Legal Education|publisher=Caribbean Community Secretariat|year=1970|accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Awarding institutions==
There are three law schools which are empowered to award LECs: the [[Norman Manley Law School]] in [[Jamaica]], the [[Hugh Wooding Law School]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and the [[Eugene Dupuch Law School]] in [[The Bahamas]]. In general, [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] graduates of the [[University of the West Indies]] are entitled to automatic admission to the above law schools, whereas others must take an entrance examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCfsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22legal+education+certificate%22|title=CARICOM: our Caribbean community|publisher=Ian Randle Publishers|year=2005|accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another agreement allows [[University of Guyana]] graduates to bypass the entrance exam as well. This exemption only applies to Guyanese nationals. In 2010, [[Solicitor-General of Belize]] [[Oscar Ramjeet]] lobbied for the exemption to be extended to Belizeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reporter.bz/2010/03/page/7/|title=GOB wants level field for Law Students in Jamaica|work=The Belize Reporter|date=2010-03-26|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An LEC allows its holder to be admitted to practise law in any country or territory which is a signature to the agreement. In general, no person who does not hold an LEC may be so admitted. The original agreement exempted persons who were qualified to practise law on or before 1 October 1971, or who were undergoing a course of study leading to a qualification which would have enabled them to practise law before that date and who completed that course before 1 January 1980.&lt;ref name="Agreement"/&gt; A supplementary agreement in September 1984 extended the transitional period, and also provided for separate principals for each of the law schools empowered to award LECs.&lt;ref name="Agreement1984"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/secretariat/legal_instruments/agreement_cle_supplemental_1984.jsp|title=Supplemental Agreement in Relation to the Council of Legal Education|publisher=Caribbean Community Secretariat|date=September 1984|accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{taxation}}
The '''Leibzoll''' ([[German language|German]]: "body tax") was a special [[tariff|toll]] which Jews had to pay in most of the European states in the [[Middle Ages]] and up to the beginning of the nineteenth century.

== Rate of the toll ==

The origin of the Leibzoll may be traced to the political position of the Jews in Germany, where they were considered crown property and, therefore, under the king's protection. In his capacity as [[Holy Roman emperor]] the king claimed the exclusive rights of the jurisdiction and taxation of the Jews, and retained responsibility for the protection of their lives and their property. He granted them protection either by a guard or by safe-conduct; chiefly by the latter, for the Jews, being extensive travelers, when they went on long business trips could not always be accompanied by imperial guards. The first instance of the granting of one of these safe-conducts occurred under [[Louis le Débonnaire]] (814–840), and a specimen of it may be found among the documents preserved in the "[[formulary (medieval)|Liber Formularum]]" of that period. According to this document the king grants freedom of travel and exemption from all taxes to three Jews of Lyons "neque teloneum, neque paravereda aut mansionaticum, aut pulveraticum, aut cespitaticum, aut ripaticum, aut rotaticum, aut portaticum, aut herbaticum prædictis Hebræis exigere præsumant" (De Rozières, "Recueil Général des Formules Usitées dans l'Empire des Francs," i. 41–43, Paris, 1859–1871; Simson, "Jahrbücher des Fränkischen Reiches Unter Ludwig, dem Frommen," i. 393–396, Leipsic, 1874–76). For such a safe-conduct the Jews were required to pay a certain fee; but this, being understood, is not stated anywhere, as the payment constitutes the only reason for the exemption from other taxes. The stipulations regulating the tolls of Raffelstetten, {{Interlanguage link multi|Lorch (Oberösterreich)|de}}, issued between 904–906, are to be interpreted in the same manner—the Jews, as privileged merchants, shall not pay more than the regular toll ("justum theloneum"). The law expressly states this conforms with the ancient custom ([[Pertz]], "Mon. Germaniæ Leges," iii. 480; [[Georg Waitz]], "Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte", iv. 1, 70, Kiel, 1884; Scherer, "Rechtsverhältnisse der Juden," p. 110, Leipsic, 1901); the same is stated in the charter granted to the Jews of Worms, 1090 ("Zeitschrift für die Gesch. der Juden in Deutschland," i. 139). When the Jews passed under the jurisdiction of the territorial rulers, this principle was acknowledged. [[Frederick II of Austria]], in his law on the Jews, issued 1244, decreed that within the limits of his state they should not pay more than the legal rate of toll—the same rate that all other citizens had to pay (Scherer, l.c. p. 181). As in the stipulations regulating the {{Interlanguage link multi|tolls of Raffelstetten|de|3=Raffelstettener Zollordnung}}, and as in the law of Frederick II, only customs duties for goods or slaves were mentioned: therefore a personal tax was unknown.

As the Jews in increasing numbers passed under territorial jurisdiction, the exemption from personal tax, which was granted them as long as they remained crown property, was no longer respected, for each territorial ruler considered himself entitled to levy taxes on all foreign Jewish subjects who passed through his territory. But these taxes continued as customs duties until, with the growing hostility of the free cities, and with the frequent expulsion from vast territories which became the rule in the fifteenth century, those rulers who had expelled the Jews from their domains determined on the adoption of a policy of keeping them away from their borders. International relations, however, would not permit of the disregard of a passport granted by a foreign ruler to one of his subjects, so when Jews visited a territory in which no Jew was permitted to settle they were subjected to the payment of a toll.

== Development of Leibzoll ==

Owing to the weakness of the imperial power of the Holy Roman Empire, Jews expelled from a place could easily settle in the vicinity, and on the strength of their passports do business in the place from which they had been expelled. So the Jews expelled from [[Nuremberg]] in 1499 settled in [[Fürth]]; those expelled from [[Nördlingen]] (1507) settled in {{Interlanguage link multi|Kleinerdlingen|de}}; those who could not gain entrance into the city of [[Lübeck]] settled in the village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Lübeck-Moisling|de}}—all places of settlement within easy walking distance of the cities in which they were denied residence. On the passports issued to them by their respective sovereigns they could engage in trade in the latter places, at least during the day, and, therefore, since the local governments wished to enforce the decrees excluding the Jews, they were driven to adopt new measures ("R. E. J." viii. 212). Administrators soon recognized the financial utility of the Leibzoll, and the territorial rulers in the German empire levied such a toll from all traveling Jews, whether foreigners or their own subjects. In Nuremberg the average annual value of the toll for the last ten years during which Leibzoll was levied (1797–1806) was 2,448 [[South German gulden|florins]] (Barbeck, "Gesch. der Juden in Nürnberg und Fürth," p. 106, Nuremberg, 1878).

The wording of the laws sometimes also suggests an intention of humiliating the Jews. For example, an ordinance of [[Philip V of Spain]] (1703) fixes the toll for a wagon-load of merchandise, one head of cattle, or one Jew, when passing over the bridges of [[Luxembourg]], at four [[sols]] ("R. E. J." viii. 208). Sometimes the humiliation lay in the form in which the tax was levied. In some places a Jew passing a toll-gate had to cast dice in remembrance of the crucifixion (Grätz, "Gesch." 3d ed., viii. 14); elsewhere, as in [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]], in [[Saxony]], Jews were forced to pay for a guard to follow them as long as they remained within the city. Even after the Leibzoll had been officially abolished, as in Austria by Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1782, Jews entering Vienna or staying there for some time had to pay a special tax which differed from Leibzoll only in name. The same may be said of Nuremberg, where Leibzoll was abolished theoretically in 1800, but was levied practically until 1806 under the name of "Passier- und Eintrittsgeld". In [[Warsaw]], where the French government had emancipated the Jews, the Russian government re-introduced the Leibzoll under the name of "Tagzettel", requiring every Jew entering the city to pay five silver [[groschen]] for the first day and three for every additional day he remained ("Allg. Zeit. des Jud." 1862, p. 12).

== Exemptions ==

Certain exemptions from Leibzoll were granted. Under the Austrian law of 1244, corpses were exempt. [[Albert III, Duke of Austria]] gave free safe-conduct to three Austrian Jews to bring "[[Etrog|etrogim]]" from [[Triest]] free of duty in 1389 (Scherer, l.c. p. 535). The Jews living within the territory of the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Elector of Mayence]] were exempted from Leibzoll when they were traveling to attend one of the regular landtags, or to meetings of the district congregations (see Bamberger, "Histor. Berichte über die Juden der Stadt Aschaffenburg," p. 26, Strasburg, 1900). As a mark of special favor, court Jews or [[Mentha|mint]]-farmers were exempt from the payment of such tolls (see [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]]). Later the exemption was extended to manufacturers; and [[Hirsch David]], [[velvet]]-manufacturer of Berlin, was exempted by the king (1731) because his business required him to travel frequently ("Allg. Zeit. des Jud." 1902, p. 477). When Meyerbeer went to Vienna, the "Judenamt" received orders to treat him "not as a Jew, but as a cavalier" (ib. 1847, p. 91). Native Jews were often exempted, for a fixed sum, from paying this toll, but naturally this freed them from it only within the confines of their own country. Thus the Jews of Saxony were exempt from the Leibzoll by an order dated 16 April 1773 (Levy, "Geschichte der Juden in Sachsen," p. 71, Berlin, 1901). The Jews of Berlin compromised with the elector, in 1700, by paying 1,000 [[ducats]] annually; this sum ("Jüdische Presse," 22 Aug. 1902) exempted only those who were in the possession of a lawful charter ("Schutzbrief"), which had replaced the old safe-conduct ("Judengeleit"), and who therefore were called "vergleitete Juden" or ''escorted Jews''.

In December, 1787, [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] of [[Prussia]] abolished the Leibzoll in Berlin, and in July, 1788, he abolished it in other places. The abolition of the toll was due largely to the exertions of [[David Friedländer]]. In 1791 the [[Bishop of Salzburg]] also abolished the toll in his own dominions.

Notwithstanding the liberal spirit which these abolitions showed, the majority of the German states still clung to the tax. With the advent of the French, however, some of them were compelled to abolish the Leibzoll. Early in July, 1798, the French general Cacatte informed the members of the government at [[Nassau-Usingen]] that, at the order of the division commander Freitag, the special taxes of the Jews were to be abolished, as they were repugnant to justice and humanity. In consequence of this order the Jews on the left bank of the [[Rhine]] were relieved from the payment of Leibzoll. At the conclusion of the [[peace of Lunéville]] (21 July 1801) the toll was re-imposed.

== Wolf Breidenbach ==

At the beginning of the nineteenth century the Jews of Germany found a courageous champion in {{Interlanguage link multi|Wolf Breidenbach|de}}, who worked persistently for the abolition of this impost. Perceiving that ample resources would be required to carry on his campaign, and not being personally able to command these, he invoked the aid of the German and foreign Jews in 1803, asking them to subscribe to the fund raised for this purpose. He instituted negotiations with the minor German princes at the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg|Diet of Ratisbon]] (1804), and, aided by [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg|Dalberg]], the imperial chancellor, succeeded in obtaining free passage for the Jews throughout the Rhine provinces and [[Bavaria]]. It was largely due to his efforts that the Leibzoll was abolished in [[Kurhessen]], [[Hohenlohe]], [[Neuwied]], [[Wied-Runkel]], [[Braunfels]], [[Solms-Rödelheim]], and also in [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]] (September, 1806). The emancipation of the Jews from these imposts created much antagonism; and among those opposed to it were such men as Paalzow, Grattenauer, and Buchholz. In the northern [[Hanse]] towns the French garrisons compelled the burghers to relieve the Jews from the payment of the Leibzoll, and, notwithstanding much opposition, secured the privilege for the Jews of [[Hamburg]], [[Lübeck]], and [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]. The Leibzoll was abolished in [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]] 23 April 1823, through the efforts of [[Israel Jacobson]], court agent to the [[Duke of Brunswick]]. Although the tax had been almost universally abolished, its collection still continued from the Jews visiting [[Vienna]] in the reign (1804–1835) of [[Francis I of Austria]]. Of the German states, [[Saxony]] was the last to abolish it.

== Russia ==

Up to 1862 the Polish Jews visiting [[Russia]] were treated as foreigners, and as such were not admitted into the interior of the empire. On the other hand, the Russian Jews had great difficulty in entering Poland, and those who went there for business had to pay a "Geleitzoll." In 1826 the representatives of the Jewish community of [[Kovno]] petitioned the government for the abolition of the tax, which amounted then to fifteen [[Polish florins]]. By order of Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] this application was referred to the [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich]], then [[Viceroy]] of Poland, who stated that he considered the abolition of the tax inexpedient, but proposed decreasing its amount and regulating it according to age, sex, and business occupation. He deemed it advisable to introduce a similar tax in Russia, and suggested that each Polish Jew entering Russia, and each Russian Jew entering Poland, should be supplied with a pass descriptive of the place of its issuance, the bearer's business, etc. The local police was to be charged with the inspection of the passes. In consequence of this report, Emperor Nicholas ordered the minister of finance to communicate with the proper authorities, and to draft the regulations for the introduction of the tax in question. After a prolonged correspondence with the Polish authorities the minister found the proposed measure to be inexpedient, not only because of the decrease in the revenues which it would effect, but also because of possible complications and abuses in its enforcement. The "Geleitzoll", therefore, remained until abolished by an [[ukase]] of 24 May 1862.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29603">This is a partial '''list of Roman laws'''. A law ([[Latin]]: ''lex'') is usually named for the sponsoring legislator and designated by the [[adjective|adjectival]] form of his ''[[gens]]'' name (''[[Roman naming convention|nomen gentilicum]]''), in the feminine form because the [[noun]] ''lex'' (plural ''leges'') is of [[grammatical gender|feminine grammatical gender]]. When a law is the initiative of the two [[Roman consul|consul]]s, it is given the name of both, with the ''nomen'' of the senior consul first. Sometimes a law is further specified by a short phrase describing the content of the law, to distinguish that law from others sponsored by members of the same ''gens''.

The '''Nationwide Multi-State Licensing System and Registry''' (NMLS) is a web-based online framework for cooperation among financial regulators in all US states to improve the effectiveness of their consumer protection mandates by aiding in the regulation of mortgage companies&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nationwide Multi-State Licensing System and Registry |url=https://www.innovations.harvard.edu/nationwide-multi-state-licensing-system-and-registry |publisher=Harvard Kennedy School}}&lt;/ref&gt;, branches, and individual mortgage loan originators. In enables the management of license applications and ongoing regulation of all non-depository financial institutions.

The system provides for all mortgage originators to be assigned a unique identifying number that would be associated with them as they moved between companies, and between states, thus helping to prevent problematic individuals from escaping the consequences of their past activities. 

==History==
===Origins===
NMLS was created in January 2008 by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators (AARMR)&lt;ref name="dbo"&gt;{{cite web |title=California's Transition to NMLS – Nationwide Multistate Licensing System |url=http://dbo.ca.gov/archives/mlo/NMLS.asp |website=California Dept. of Business Oversight |publisher=State of California |accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, both based in Washington, DC. It began operations as a voluntary system among seven states cooperating to improve regulation of the mortgage and other non-depository industries through better supervision, streamlined licensing procedures, and enhanced consumer protection.

===The SAFE Act===
Title V of The Housing and Economic Recovery Act for 2008 (HERA), the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act, required that all states license mortgage originators through NMLS, and required all licensed and registered mortgage originators to register with NMLS&lt;ref name="oneforall"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vong |first1=John |title=One For All, All For One |url=https://www.regulatorconnect.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=4V0KeOWaj88%3D&amp;tabid=96&amp;mid=406 |publisher=Mortgage Banking |accessdate=August 6, 2018 |date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The SAFE Act requires originators to complete pre-licensing education approved by NMLS.

===Expansion===
In 2017, New York regulators announced the expansion of their use of NMLS to include regulation of money transmitters&lt;ref name="housingwire"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Swanson |first1=Brena |title=New York regulators expand NMLS to broaden authority |url=https://www.housingwire.com/articles/40109-new-york-regulators-expand-nmls-to-broaden-authority |website=HousingWire |publisher=HousingWire |accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===NMLS 2.0===
NMLS 2.0 is scheduled for release in the second quarter of 2019&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=Phil |title=NMLS 2.0 Debut Delayed for One Year |url=https://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/66217/nmls-debut-delayed-year |website=National Mortgage Professional Magazine |accessdate=August 6, 2018 |ref=nmpm}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Ohio Collective Bargaining Limit Repeal''' appeared on the November 8, 2011 general election ballot in the state of [[Ohio]] as a [[veto referendum]]. Senate Bill 5 (SB5) was repealed by Ohio voters after a campaign by firefighters, police officers and teachers against the measure,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.local12.com/news/local/story/Ohio-Issue-2-Collective-Bargaining-Rejected/2ymromy-CE-vw-CBVV-_iQ.cspx&lt;/ref&gt; which would have limited [[collective bargaining]] for public employees in the state. The formal title of the proposal that this measure nullified is Senate Bill 5. Among other provisions, SB 5 would have prevented unions from charging [[Union security agreement|fair share]] dues to employees who opt out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/04/ohios_senate_bill_5_will_bring.html|title=Ohio's Senate Bill 5 will bring dramatic changes|date=April 3, 2011|first=Mark|last=Naymik|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process to place the referendum on the ballot for voters to decide was completed by supporters, as signatures were certified by the Ohio Secretary of State. The group behind the referendum effort was the political action committee We Are Ohio.

Senate Bill 5 would have impacted the state's 400,000 public workers, restricting their ability to [[Strike action|strike]] and collectively bargain. The bill would have limited public employees to collectively bargain for wages, preventing them from collectively bargaining for health insurance and pensions. It would also have prohibited all public employees from striking and could have increased employee contributions for pensions and healthcare.

According to reports, the measure's language was decided on August 3, 2011. A "yes" vote was a vote to keep the law, while a "no" vote was a vote to repeal the law. Interests raised more than $30 million for the campaign.

==Path to the ballot==
===Enactment of SB 5===
The [[Ohio State Senate]] passed Senate Bill 5 with a vote of 17-16, sending the measure to the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] for a similar vote. According to reports, on March 28, 2011, the chamber was preparing to vote on the proposal.  [[Ohio House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Bob Hagan]] stated that the measure was most likely going to be voted on by March 30, 2011&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/03/in-ohio-labor-rallies-for-referendum-against-anti-union-bill/72569/ ''The Atlantic'', "In Ohio, Labor Rallies for Referendum Against Anti-Union Bill", March 16, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://business-journal.com/ohio-house-prepares-to-vote-on-sb-p18841-1.htm ''Business-Journal.com'', "Ohio House Prepares to Vote on SB 5", March 28, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
On that day, Senate Bill 5 passed the [[Ohio House of Representatives|House]] by a margin of 53-44. The house-modified bill was referred back to the senate where it was approved before being sent to the [[John Kasich|Governor's]] desk. It was then signed into law on March 31, 2011&lt;ref name="cleve"&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/03/opponents_supporters_gear_up_f.html  ''Cleveland.com,'' "Opponents, supporters gear up for Senate Bill 5 referendum," March 30, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cinci"&gt;[http://communitypress.cincinnati.com/article/AB/20110330/NEWS0108/303300054/Ohio-House-approves-Senate-Bill-5?odyssey=mod|newswell|text|communities|s ''Cincinnati,'' "Ohio House approves Senate Bill 5," March 30, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Referendum process===
Supporters collected about 3,000 signatures during the weekend of April 1, 2011, more than enough to turn in to the [[Ohio Secretary of State]]'s office for the first step of the referendum process. A minimum of 1,000 valid signatures are required to launch a referendum. The first batch was turned in on April 4, 2011, according to reports. The [[Ohio Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] verified the submitted signatures on April 15, 2011. The verification launched the second part of the referendum process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/04/04/sb-5-opponents-move-swiftly-to-get-referendum-on-ballot.html?sid=101 ''The Columbus Dispatch'', "SB 5 opponents move swiftly to get referendum on ballot", April 4, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtam.com/cc-common/news/sections/newsarticle.html?feed=122520&amp;article=8440732 ''WTAM.com'', "SB5 ballot referendum moves forward", April 15, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to state law, referendum supporters have until June 30, 2011, 90 days after the targeted law is signed by the [[Governor of Ohio|state governor]], to collect additional signatures. A total of 231,149 signatures must be collected from registered voters; equal to 6 percent of the total number of voters in the 2010 gubernatorial election. Additionally, those signatures must come from at least half of the 88 counties in the state.&lt;ref name=bill&gt;[http://business-journal.com/sb-vote-in-helps-gop-in-p18697-1.htm ''Business Journal'', "S.B. 5 Vote in 2011 Helps GOP in 2012", March 4, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ohio Secretary of State]] had until July 26, 2011 to verify signatures once they were turned in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoplesdefender.com/main.asp?SectionID=13&amp;SubSectionID=83&amp;ArticleID=133319 ''The People's Defender'', "Petitions circulating to repeal SB 5", April 30, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal then went to the [http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/elections/IssueProcBallotBd/BallotBoard.aspx Ohio Ballot Board]. The board then had total control over how the measure will be presented to voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/06/23/multiple-choice-for-sb-5-vote.html?sid=101 ''Columbus Dispatch'', "Multiple choice for SB 5 vote?", June 23, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signature gathering===
On June 17, 2011, less than two weeks before the petition drive deadline, supporters announced the collection of 714,137 signatures. Previously, on May 20, 2011, supporters claimed that they had collected approximately 214,000 signatures.  We Are Ohio spokeswoman Melissa Fazekas stated that a sampling of those signatures showed a validation rate of about 60 percent. According to reports, the group must collect 400,000 signatures at that rate in order for the measure to make the ballot. According to Fazekas at the time: "Our goal is to collect between 450,000 and 500,000 [signatures]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twinsburgbulletin.com/news/article/5039069 ''Twinsburg Bulletin'', "SB5 opponents say they're well on their way to November ballot", May 23, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://weareohio.com/MediaCenter/PressReleases/PR_061711.html ''weareohio.com'', "We Are Ohio Announces New Petition Signature Totals", June 17, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signature submission===
In a record breaking performance, referendum proponents submitted a grand total of 1,298,301 signatures to the [[Ohio Secretary of State]] on June 29, 2011 in a parade marching towards the secretary's offices. This breaks the previously held record of 812,978 signatures in 2008 for a constitutional amendment allowing a casino resort in [[Clinton County, Ohio|Clinton County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toledoblade.com/State/2011/06/30/Record-1-3M-back-vote-to-torpedo-Senate-Bill-5-2.html ''Toledo Blade'', "Record 1.3M back vote to torpedo Senate Bill 5", June 30, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signature verification===
According to Matt McClellan, spokesperson for the [[Ohio Secretary of State]]:  "The next step the signatures have to be verified. The secretary's office receives the petitions and we will take an inventory of them. Then we send them out to the proper county boards of election. They have the signatures on file."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irontontribune.com/2011/06/30/next-step-for-senate-bill-5-petitions/ ''Ironton Tribune'', "Next step for Senate Bill 5 petitions", June 30, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

44 of the state's counties must have three percent of the signatures of those who voted in the 2010 gubernatorial election.

According to reports as of July 17, 2011, the proponents appeared to have enough signatures for the ballot. Although not all numbers had been verified, some counties recorded a high amount of verification rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/07/17/count-on-sb-5-being-on-ballot.html?sid=101 ''The Columbus Dispatch'', "Count on SB 5 being on ballot", July 17, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was then certified on July 21, 2011 by the [[Ohio Secretary of State]].

Of the more than 1.3 million signatures submitted by supporters, the secretary of state's office certified 915,456 for an approximately 70.5% validation rate.  The Ballot Board, which is given the responsibility of crafting ballot language,  met on August 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toledoonthemove.com/news/story.aspx?id=642997 ''Toledo On The Move'', "Secretary of State certifies S.B. 5 referendum signatures", July 21, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/07/26/hearing-on-sb-5-ballot-language-scheduled.html?sid=101 ''The Columbus Dispatch'', "Hearing on SB 5 ballot language scheduled", July 26, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1854 opening of the 1st Cape Parliament - Cape Archives.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Engraving of the first opening of the Cape Parliament in 1854.]]
The '''Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope''' functioned as the legislature of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], from its founding in 1853, until the creation of the [[Union of South Africa|Union]] of South Africa in 1910, when it was dissolved and the [[Parliament of South Africa]] was established. It consisted of the [[House of Assembly]] (the lower house) and the legislative council (the upper house).

==The First Parliament==
[[File:Cape Colony Legislative Council Chamber - 1875.png|thumb|The Cape's Legislative Council.]]
Prior to responsible government, the British government granted the Cape Colony a rudimentary and relatively powerless Legislative Council in 1835.

The British attempt to turn the Cape into a penal colony for convicts, similar to Australia, mobilised the local population in the 1840s and threw up a generation of local leaders who believed that far-away Britain was not capable of understanding local interests and issues. This group of politicians, which included the likes of [[William Porter (attorney-general)|Porter]], [[Saul Solomon|Solomon]], [[John Fairbairn (educator)|Fairbairn]], [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno]], [[Andries Stockenström|Stockenström]] and [[Hercules Crosse Jarvis|Jarvis]], shared not only a common belief in the importance of local self-government, but also an explicit commitment to a liberal, inclusive and multi-racial political system.&lt;ref&gt;RFM Immelman: ''Men of Good Hope, 1804-1954''. CTCC: Cape Town, 1955. Chapter 6 ''The Anti-convict Agitation''. p.154.&lt;/ref&gt;

This political elite successfully began the controversial drive for Cape independence which, unusually, was attained in the end through gradual evolution, rather than sudden revolution.&lt;ref&gt;JL. McCracken: ''The Cape Parliament''. Clarendon Press: Oxford. 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Representative Government (1853)===
The Queen granted the Cape its first Parliament in 1853, and the local leadership were permitted to draft a constitution. This was a relatively liberal document that prohibited race or class discrimination, and instituted the non-racial [[Cape Qualified Franchise]], whereby the same qualifications for suffrage were applied equally to all males, regardless of race. The pre-existing Legislative Council became the upper house of the new parliament, and was elected according to the two main provinces of that Cape at the time. A new lower house, the Assembly, was also constituted. However, the parliament was weak and executive power remained firmly in the hands of the [[Governor of Cape Colony|Governor]] who was appointed from London.

The British Governor opened this first parliament at his residence, "the [[Tuynhuys]]", but the House of Assembly soon relocated to the small but stately Goede Hoop Masonic Lodge buildings. The old Legislative Council (now reconstituted as the Parliament's upper house) was housed at the nearby Old Supreme Court building (now the Iziko Slave Lodge Museum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/oldcapehousebein00kilpiala/oldcapehousebein00kilpiala_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The old Cape House, being pages from the history of a legislative assembly"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsible Government (1872)===
[[File:GoedeHoop Masonic Lodge 1872 - Cape Parliament.jpg|thumb|The [[Masonic Lodge]] which served as the venue of the first Cape Parliament.]]

Among the Cape's powerful local leaders, a radical faction under the leadership of [[John Molteno]] pushed for further independence in the form of "[[Responsible Government]]". This was attained in 1872, after a political struggle that lasted a decade. "Responsible Government" brought all branches of the Cape's government under local control by making the Executive directly "responsible" to Parliament and electorate for the first time.

There followed a brief boom period in the history of the Cape, with the economy surging, the frontiers stable and local democracy taking root. 
The new constitution held the non-racial nature of its political system as one of its core values. The universal [[Cape Qualified Franchise|qualification for suffrage]] (£25) was sufficiently low to ensure that most owners of any form of property or land could vote; and there was a determination on the part of the Government not to raise it, on the understanding that rising levels of wealth would eventually render it obsolete. There were the early beginnings of a drive to register the many new potential voters, particularly the rural [[Xhosa people]] of the frontier region, who were mostly communal land owners and therefore eligible for suffrage. Opportunistic politicians soon followed, to campaign for Black African voters.

The new government based itself in the halls of the Masonic Lodge where the previous parliaments had sat. This relatively humble building was seen as suitably central and close to the Legislative Council building. 
The large gardens of the Lodge soon became a popular venue for the public, with concerts, theatre and finally the "[[South African International Exhibition]]" which [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno]] sponsored in 1877. 
The Parliamentary hall itself was open to members of the public, also explicitly ''"irrespective of class or colour"'', should they wish to observe the performance of their representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasonrysd.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=546%3Alodge-de-goede-hoop-and-the-cape-house-of-assembly&amp;catid=46%3Aover-200-years-of-history&amp;Itemid=66 |title=Lodge de Goede Hoop and the Cape House of Assembly &amp;#124; Grand Lodge of South Africa – Southern Division |publisher=Freemasonrysd.co.za |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewcusack.com/2009/11/03/die-parlementsgebou/|title=The Houses of Parliament, Cape Town - andrewcusack.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.at/heritage/history/british.htm|title=Cape Town History and Heritage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co. 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

The operating language of the parliament in the early years of Responsible Government was English, though Afrikaans was often spoken informally. Dutch was added by parliamentary act in 1882, by MP [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan)|"Onze Jan" Hofmeyr]] with the powerful support of [[Saul Solomon]]. A statement was also made, on its introduction, that the recognition of a "Native" language, as a third official language, would also be acceptable, but only once sufficient "Native" parliamentarians were elected.&lt;ref&gt;JL. McCracken: The Cape Parliament. Clarendon Press: Oxford. 1967. p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The new Parliament building==

===The building fiasco===
[[File:Original plan for the Cape Parliament - Freeman.jpg|thumb|Freeman's original elaborate plan for the new Parliament.]]
[[File:Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope - CapeArch.jpg|thumb|The final Parliament building as constructed (without statues, dome or fountains)]]

From the beginning of Responsible Government, there were increasingly vocal complaints from members of parliament about the humble appearance of their venue. MPs increasingly complained that the Parliament would not attract sufficient respect from "the public and strangers", unless a more grandiose edifice were constructed.

A brief controversy arose about this need to build a more stately Parliament, as Prime Minister Molteno was not an ostentatious man, and had little interest in spending tax money on what he saw as essentially an expensive vanity project (At the time an enormous countrywide programme was underway, of building schools, public transport and communications infrastructure, and funds were consequently in tight demand). He was over-ruled by the legislature however, and the Commissioner of Public Works, [[Charles Abercrombie Smith]], ordered a select committee to receive designs.

The committee selected the elaborate proposal of the renowned architect {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles Freeman (architect)|af|3=Charles Freeman}}, at the time an officer in the Public Works Department. Sites that were mooted for the new building included [[Greenmarket Square]], Caledon Square and the top of Government Avenue, but eventually the current site was selected. Freeman was made resident architect and construction began on 12 May 1875, with Governor [[Henry Barkly]] laying the cornerstone.

Almost immediately it was discovered that Freeman's plans were faulty. Freeman's errors were compounded by the presence of groundwater, and a recalculation of the budget revealed that the actual costs would be many times the original figure that the government had allowed for.

The Cape government stepped in. Freeman was fired for incompetence and the Public Works Commission was re-structured. There was initially some discussion in parliament about abandoning the half-finished building. However, the government ordered the project completed, even though the budget was now calculated to be many times the original sum. In 1876 it appointed Henry Greaves to alter Freeman's plans, fix the faulty foundations, and see the project successfully through. Moreover, it ordered him to remove from the plan the statues, parapets, fountains, elaborate dome and other expensive flourishes.

Building re-commenced, but was delayed – this time by the British overthrow of the Cape government in 1878, the ensuing Confederation Wars, and finally by the building company going bankrupt in 1883. 
Greaves tenaciously completed the job however, and the large, stately, but relatively unpretentious building was finally opened in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Lewsen: ''The First Crises in Responsible Government in the Cape Colony''. University of The Witwatersrand / Argief-jaarboek vir Suid-Afrikaanse geskiedenis. 1940/3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cape Prime Minister [[Thomas Scanlen]], and British Governor Henry Robinson led the opening ceremony in the building, declared finally to be worthy of the country's Legislature.

===The restricting of the multi-racial franchise===
{{main|Cape Qualified Franchise}}
[[File:Cecil john rhodes00.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cecil John Rhodes]], as Prime Minister, did much to restrict African representation in the Cape Parliament.]]
Over the years, as the Cape's early generation of political heavy-weights died or retired, power moved away from their liberal heirs, and towards [[Imperialism|pro-imperialist]] opposition politicians who wanted stronger ties with the [[British Empire]] and saw the multi-racial franchise as a threat to [[White Supremacism|white political control]].

This radical opposition had its origins in the white Eastern Cape separatist movement who had been threatened by the political mobilisation of their [[Xhosa people|Xhosa neighbours]]. It gained office under Prime Minister [[Gordon Sprigg]], and eventually reached the height of its power as the pro-imperialist "[[Progressive Party (Cape Colony)|Progressive Party]]" under Prime Minister [[Cecil John Rhodes]], the most dictatorial and aggressively expansionist leader in Cape history.

The liberals (now on the defensive, as the opposition "[[South African Party (Cape Colony)|South African Party]]") attempted to further mobilise the Cape's Black population in a desperate attempt to find allies to the liberal &amp; multi-racial cause. However they were outmanoeuvred by Rhodes and his allies, who imposed increasingly severe legal restrictions on the African franchise. As fast as the African voters mobilised, their numbers were diminished through discriminatory legislation.

The [[Cape Qualified Franchise|Parliamentary Registration Act]] (1887) removed traditional African forms of communal land-ownership from the franchise qualifications, thus disenfranchising a large portion of the Cape's Xhosa population. 
Rhodes's [[Franchise and Ballot Act]] (1892) finally succeeded in raising the franchise qualification from £25 to £75, disenfranchising the poorest classes of all race groups (including poor whites) but effecting a disproportionately large percentage of the African voters. It also added literacy as a franchise qualification, intended to target the (still mostly illiterate) Xhosa voters of the Cape. 
Finally, the [[Glen Grey Act]] (1894) re-drew the laws on rural African land tenure and effectively disqualified nearly all rural Africans from the vote.

The end result was that, by the end of Rhodes's Ministry, only a small portion of relatively wealthy, educated, urban Black Africans were still permitted to vote.&lt;ref&gt;P.

Decades later, with the rise of [[Apartheid]] after Union, all restrictions were removed for White voters, meaning that the remaining qualifications of the Cape Qualified Franchise only applied to non-whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4605 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522174733/http://anc.org.za/show.php?id=4605 |archivedate=22 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ProfLodge&gt;{{cite book|author=ProfessorLodge|title=Compendium of Elections in Southern Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Compendium_of_Elections_in_Southern_Afri.html?id=0Rd0QgAACAAJ/South_Africa|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move towards Union===

In the early twentieth century, following the tumults of the [[Anglo-Boer war]]s, the whole of southern Africa was finally under the control of the [[British Empire]]. The union of the various component states of the region was again discussed. Several previous attempts at union had failed, but in 1909 a [[National Convention (South Africa)|National Convention]] was instituted in Cape Town, to unite the Cape of Good Hope with Natal, the Transvaal, and the Orange Free State, to form a united country of "South Africa". 
The Convention met in the Cape Assembly's chamber of the Cape Parliament building, and it was here that the new constitution for South Africa was drawn up.

The [[Union of South Africa]] was proclaimed the following year, in 1910, and the old Cape Parliamentary building became the home of the new [[Parliament of South Africa]]. The provincial government of the Cape, now the "Cape Province", was set up in a new building nearby, the [[Western Cape Provincial Parliament|Pronvisiale-gebou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mieliestronk.com/saparlem.html|title=Ons parlement in die Kaap|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post of prime minister of the Cape Colony also became extinct on 31 May 1910, when it joined the Union of South Africa.

===Political parties===

====Early informal groupings (1854-1881)====
[[File:Cape Town - Speeches on the Convict Crisis by T Bowler1849 Cape Archives.jpg|thumb|right|The mid-19th century Convict Crisis was a question which created a (temporary) political grouping, even before the establishment of the Cape's first parliament in 1854.]]
For much of the Cape's history, the parliament operated without formal political parties. Instead, parliamentarians aligned temporarily – according to specific issues. Nonetheless, informal alliances began to form according to the constituencies' overall attitude to long-standing issues, such as [[Responsible Government]], the [[Cape Qualified Franchise|multi-racial franchise]], territorial expansion, separatism and relations with the [[British Empire]].

[[File:John Molteno and Saul Solomon preside over Cape Government - Zingari cartoon 1873.jpg|thumb|1873 cartoon critical of Responsible Government, showing the sharing out of power and positions to the various factions.]] 
In the 1860s and early 70s, an alliance of parliamentarians came together in support of "[[Responsible Government]]". These parliamentarians distrusted British imperial rule; desired greater local independence; sought a greater focus on internal development rather than imperial expansion; and professed a strong commitment to racial and regional unity throughout the Cape. Prominent leaders were William Porter, Saul Solomon, John Molteno, Hercules Jarvis and [[Charles Lennox Stretch]]. This alliance later became known as the "Westerners" due to their headquarters in [[Cape Town]], or by the nickname of the "responsibles". 
Opposing them were a group of parliamentarians representing mainly white, British settler constituencies in the Eastern Cape near the frontier. Close to the neighbouring Xhosa lands, these politicians represented their constituents' fears of the more numerous Xhosa. They tended to support more direct British imperial rule, stronger policies regarding border defence and imperial expansion into Africa to open up lands for white settlement. They resented the political dominance of the more "liberal" Westerners and saw the solution to be a separate white "Eastern Cape Colony" under direct British rule, with [[Port Elizabeth]] as its capital. For much of this time they were led by the representative of Port Elizabeth, [[John Paterson (Cape politician)|John Paterson]]. They were known as the "Easterners" or the "Separatist League".

This decades long struggle was brought to an end in 1872, with the apparent triumph of the liberal faction and the achievement of responsible government. 
The newly elected Molteno government then brought together a broad alliance, run on liberal principles but incorporating several easterners and support from the Cape's Afrikaner and Black communities. The new government's inclusive policies extinguished the separatist league, but the ideology and interests of the frontier settlers survived and resurfaced years later.&lt;ref&gt;A.L. Harrington: ''The Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope, with special reference to party politics 1872-1910''. Government Printer, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Cape Times 1876-1910 history, the 1870s was referred to as last decade before the onset of formal party divisions: "But in the 1870s, there were still no clearly defined political parties in the Cape Parliament. Responsible government had been granted in 1872 and the first Prime Minister, J.C. Molteno, was still in office. Saul Solomon, in spite of his diminutive size and physical handicap, was at the height of his powers and was probably the outstanding figure in the House, noted for his outspoken liberalism and his concern for the interests of Africans."&lt;ref&gt;G.Shaw: ''Some Beginnings: The Cape Times 1876-1910''. London: Oxford University Press. 1975. {{ISBN|0195700716}}. p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rise of political parties (1881-1910)====
[[File:An AD MISERICORDIAM appeal - Lantern - 13 March 1880.jpg|thumb|left|pro-imperialist 1880 cartoon criticising the Afrikaners for preferring the "chaos" of independence, over the "prosperity" of annexation to the British empire.]]
[[File:OnzeJanHofmeyr crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan)]], long-term leader of the [[Afrikaner Bond]].]]
Two key events contributed to the rise of political parties. The first was the 1878 British takeover and the ensuing "Confederation wars". After deposing the elected government, the British Governor installed a former separatist, [[John Gordon Sprigg]], as the new Prime Minister, with instructions to implement the British Colonial Office's policies. Sprigg formed a cabinet composed entirely of Eastern frontier British settlers, but contributed to a new pro-imperialist ideology that was not tied to any particular region of the Cape, or indeed, of southern Africa. British moves against the Boer republics and perceptions of exclusion caused growing resentment in the Afrikaner or "[[Cape Dutch]]" population.

This led to the second key event, which was the founding of the [[Afrikaner Bond]] in 1881. The Afrikaner Bond was the Cape's first formal political party, headed by [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan)]], and taking a strong stance for Afrikaner rights and (increasingly) against the political empowerment of the Cape's Black citizens. The formation of the Bond severely weakened the liberal "Westerners" by splitting this bloc, and beginning their decline. 
The resulting three parties aligned differently according to the predominant issues of the day, with the Afrikaner Bond playing a central role as "King-maker": The liberals and the Bond agreed on the need to minimise British intervention in southern Africa, while the pro-imperialists and the Bond agreed on further restricting the rights of the Cape's Black citizens.

The pro-imperialist grouping was by now known as "[[Progressive Party (Cape Colony)|Progressives]]", and this movement reached the height of its power under Prime Minister [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Rhodes's orchestration of the [[Jameson Raid]] sharply polarised the Cape's politics to an unprecedented degree.

[[File:JT Jabavu - A Abdurahman - W Schreiner - W Rubusana and other Cape politicians of anti-South Africa Act delegation.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Philip Schreiner|William Schreiner]] (centre, seated) with South African Party leaders, and activists, including [[John Tengo Jabavu]], [[Walter Rubusana]] and [[Abdullah Abdurahman|Abdurahman]] in the delegation which lobbied the [[South Africa Act 1909|London Convention on Union]] for the multi-racial franchise.]] 
The remaining liberal "westerners" formed the "[[South African Party (Cape Colony)|South African Party]]" but were too weak to oppose Rhodes's Progressives alone, and so allied with the Afrikaner Bond to fight Rhodes's dominance. This controversial alliance with the racist Bond caused many of the South African Party's black voters to abandon it. It came to power briefly under its liberal leader [[William Philip Schreiner|William Schreiner]] but overall the ensuing decades were dominated by the Progressive Party. 
In 1908, [[John X Merriman]] finally led the South African Party to electoral victory, a mere two years before the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910.

====Political parties after Union (1910)====
After Union, the South African Party merged with the Afrikaner Bond, [[Het Volk (political party)|Het Volk]] of the Transvaal and Orangia Unie of the Orange Free State, to form a new Union-wide [[South African Party]]. After this merger, the policies of the larger Afrikaner parties came to predominate and the distinctive liberalness of the original South African Party was subsumed, as South Africa began its long slide into Apartheid. 
Meanwhile, the Progressives (renamed the "Union Party of the Cape") merged with the Progressive Association of the Transvaal and the Constitutional Party of the Orange Free State to form the [[Unionist Party (South Africa)|Unionist Party]]. 
The [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] traces its origins to these parties through numerous successors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30355">‘Net positive’, from '''Positive Development''' (PD) theory, is a new paradigm in [[sustainable development]] and design.  PD theory (taught and published from 2003)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2003) ‘Retrofitting: Beyond Zero Waste’, in ''KLM-UC International Conference Proceedings'', University of Canberra, ACT, Australia; Birkeland, J. (2004) ‘Building Assessment Systems: Reversing Environmental Impacts’, Nature and Society Forum, ACT, Australia, http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland (accessed 2005);  Birkeland, J. (2005) ‘Reversing Negative Impacts by Design’, in ''Sustainability for the ACT: the Future’s in our Hands'', Office of Sustainability, ACT, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; was first detailed in ''Positive Development'' (2008).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development: From Vicious Circles to Virtuous Cycles through Built Environment Design’'', Earthscan, London.  (A two volume book updating net positive theory is forthcoming.)&lt;/ref&gt; A net positive system/structure would ‘give back to nature and society more than it takes’ over its life cycle.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Eco-positive impacts of development must keep pace with human consumption (or ecological footprint) and offset past losses of nature, as defined in ''Positive Development'' ''(Ibid)'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ‘sustainable development’ - in the real-world context of population growth, biodiversity losses, cumulative pollution, wealth disparities and social inequities - closes off future options.  To reverse direction, development must, among other sustainability criteria, increase nature beyond pre-human conditions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;A sustainable building should aim to be better for nature/society than no building at all, as well as increase nature beyond native conditions.  A rule of reason would be applied as to whether the baseline is pre-industrial or pre-historic, depending on the location and circumstances.&lt;/ref&gt; PD develops the tools to enable net positive design and development.

== Net Positive Sustainability ==
According to PD, the original precepts of sustainability (nature preservation and equity among current/future generations)&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;These principles are common to most early definitions of sustainability and were endorsed at a national level as early as 1969 in the preamble to the National Environmental Protection Act in the United States. Among the first international documents to define sustainability was the IUCN/UNEP/WWF (1980) ''World Conservation Strategy'', re-published in 1991 as ''Caring for the Earth: A Strategy for Sustainable Living'', The World Conservation Union, United Nations Environment Program and World Wide Fund for Nature, Earthscan, London, UK.  Here it meant improving life quality within the earth’s ecological carrying capacity. See also COAG (1992) The National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development (NSESD), Council of Australian Governments, Canberra, Australia.  For historical context, see Commoner, B. (1971) ''The Closing Circle: Nature, Man And Technology'', Knopf, New York and Porritt, J. (1985) ''Seeing Green: The Politics of Ecology Explained'', Blackwell Publishers, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; require increasing future options.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Social options do not mean more consumer products but rather substantive and positive life choices which requires increasing the ecological base and public estate.&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, requires that development increase the life support system (nature).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;The idea that sustainability requires maintaining or increasing future option was discussed in Birkeland, J. (1993) ''Planning for a Sustainable Society: Institutional Reform and Social Transformation'', University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania. See also Norton, B.G. (2005) ''Sustainability: A Philosophy of Adaptive Ecosystem Management'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois for a comprehensive discussion on this point.&lt;/ref&gt; Green design always aimed for ecological restoration, social regeneration and economic revitalization.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;For a typology of green building design, see Birkeland, J. (2013) ‘Business Opportunities through Positive Development’, in ''A New Dynamic: Effective Business in a Circular Economy'', in K. Webster, J. Bleriot, and C. Johnston (Eds), Ellen MacArthur Foundation Publishing, Isle of Wight, UK, pp. 87-110.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these essentially ‘add value’ relative to ''current'' sites, buildings or practices.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;For a discussion of contemporary sustainable building design approaches, see Hes, D. and du Plessus, D. (2015) ''Designing for Hope: Pathways to Regenerative Sustainability'', Taylor &amp; Francis, New York. USA.&lt;/ref&gt; They do not increase nature in absolute terms.  Positive development is defined as structures that increase universal life quality and future options by expanding the ‘ecological base’ (ecosystems, ecological carrying capacity, biodiversity) and the ‘public estate’ (universal access to means of survival/wellbeing and social capital).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2007) ‘GEN 4: ‘Positive Development’, ''BEDP (Built Environment Design Professions) Environmental Design Guide of the Australian Institute of Architects'', ACT, Australia. http://www.environmentdesignguide.com.au/ Assessed June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology Clarification ==
The term net positive&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;The term also appears as ‘net-positive’ or ‘netpositive’.  A special issue was dedicated to net-positive design.  See Cole, R. (2015) ‘Net-zero and Net-positive Design: a question of value’, in ''Building Research &amp; Information'' 43(1), pp. 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; is increasingly used by green designers, developers and businesses.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;For example, see Forum for the Future, WWF, and The Climate Group (2015) ''Net Positive: A New Way of Doing Business''. Available at http://www.theclimategroup.org/what-we-do/publications/net-positive-a-new-way-of-doing-business/ Accessed June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in context, it usually means just ‘giving back’ - that is, without fixed baselines&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Benchmarks are relative to the present, so eco-restoration is seen by some as net positive, yet this does not account for past biodiversity losses and increased human consumption.&lt;/ref&gt; - by optimizing material resources, energy and stakeholder benefits, etc.  This was the aim of 20th Century green building design.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;There are a wide range of 20th Century green design books, including:  Papanek, V. (1971) ''Design for the Real World: human ecology and social change'', Pantheon Books, New York; Johnson, R. (1979) ''The Green City'', MacMillan: S. Melbourne, Australia;  Todd, N. and J. Todd (1994) ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines'', N. Atlantic Books, Berkeley, CA.; Vale, B. and R. Vale (1975) ''The Autonomous House: Design and Planning for self-''sufficiency, Thames and Hudson Ltd, London;  Wann, D. (1996) ''Deep Design: Pathways to a Liveable Future'', Island Press, Washington, DC.;  Lyle, J.T. (1994) ''Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development'', Wiley &amp; Sons, New York;  van der Ryn, S, and Cowan, D. (1996)  ''Ecological Design'', Island Press, Washington, DC.  Mackenzie, D. (1991), ''Green Design: Design for the Environment'', Lawrence King, London;  Girardet, H. (1992), ''The Gaia Atlas of Cities: New Directions for Sustainable Urban Living'', Gaia books Ltd, London; and Yeang, K. (1999) ''The Green Skyscraper: The Basis for Designing Sustainable Intensive Buildings'', Prestel Verlag, Munich, Germany [Yeang has written numerous books on green design].&lt;/ref&gt; Although environmental ethics and social justice remain central concerns in PD,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Social factors have always been a part of sustainable design paradigms, but the focus is generally on the (psychological, social, physiological, experiential, etc.) needs of building users, and less on using a building project to solve social inequities in the wider community.&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, ‘eco-positive’ is increasingly used to underscore the ecological dimension. The term ‘net’ also causes some confusion.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;See for example, Baggs, D. (2015) Buildings Alone will Never be Regenerative, in ''Sourceable - Industry News and Analysis'' https://sourceable.net/buildings-alone-will-never-be-regenerative/ June 29.  Accessed July 2015.  This claims net positive design only concerns resource balances and does not use a life cycle perspective, but this has no basis in PD literature.&lt;/ref&gt; In PD, ‘net’ means public benefits ''beyond'' neutral impacts - not just reducing the total negative impacts to zero by, for example, making tradeoffs.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;For an overview of zero energy building, see Kibert, C.J. and Fard, M.M. (2012) Differentiating among Low-energy, Low-carbon and Net Zero-energy Building Strategies for Policy Formulation, ''Building Research &amp; Information'', 40(5), pp. 625-637.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory Origins ==
PD theory built on eco-philosophies that emerged in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;See for example, Merchant, C. (1980) ''The Death of Nature: Women, ecology, and the scientific revolution'', HarperCollins, New York; Warren, K. (1997), ''Ecofeminism: Women, Culture, Nature'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana;  Naess, A. (1989) ''Ecology, community, and lifestyle'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, UK; Warren, K. and Wells-Howe, B. (1994) ''Ecological Feminism'', Routledge, New York;  Salleh, A. (1997) ''Ecofeminism as Politics: Nature, Marx and the Postmodern'', Zed Books, London;  Shiva, V. (1988) ''Staying Alive: Women, Ecology and Development'', Zed Books, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Calling for social transformation, they deconstructed the hierarchical cultures, dualistic thought patterns and linear-reductionist analyses of modernity. PD added a positive/negative overlay to explain why these theories did not contemplate increasing nature to offset consumption. Later, sustainability was absorbed into the dominant paradigm (DP) which assumed that current institutions could resolve the problems they fostered.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;See WCED (1987) ''Our Common Future'', Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK.  This seminal report couched sustainability within the dominant economic and policy making frameworks and did not engage with the sustainability literature critical of the dominant paradigm.&lt;/ref&gt; According to PD, existing institutional and physical structures reduce future options and are thus terminal.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;''Planning for Sustainability, Ibid.'' Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development, Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was that, by converting negative systems into positive ones, genuinely sustainable planning, decision and design frameworks would materialize.

=== Design-decision Distinction ===
The distinction between decision-making and design is central to PD.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;See Birkeland, J. (2012) ‘Design blindness in Sustainable Development: From Closed to Open Systems Design Thinking’, in ''The Journal of Urban Design'', 17(2), pp. 163-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Decision-making processes/tools divide, compare and choose.  They use bounded or ‘closed system’ thinking which excludes considerations that are difficult to quantify.  Essentially, decision methods simplify issues and options to facilitate finding the best path from the present position or desired future.  Back-casting and scenario planning, while powerful tools, presume the future can be predicted and selected.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 165-179&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods decide now how future citizens must live.  They also reduce future options by narrowing resources, adaptability, space and biodiversity over time. Sustainability therefore requires rethinking decision-making and design tools from first principles.

=== Decision-making (reducing costs) ===
The reduction of the ecological base and public estate continues, PD argues, because new sustainability goals were spliced onto the old (anti-ecological) closed system models, methods and metrics of the DP.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; Given escalating human consumption, even global depopulation and ecological regeneration would not counterbalance total negative resource flows and ecological impacts. PD maintains that closed system models created and institutionalized zero-sum decision and measurement frameworks such as cost-benefit/risk-benefit analyses.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 117-130.&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies and ‘reverses’ over a hundred systemic biases in governance, planning, decision and design frameworks by converting them into open system and design-based frameworks to facilitate eco-positive planning and design.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Positive Development and Assessment’, in ''Smart and Sustainable Built Environments'', 3(1), pp. 4-22;  Birkeland, J. (2015) ‘Planning for Positive Development’, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design (multiplying benefits) ===
Whereas the internal logic of decision frameworks (choosing) tend to diminish ecosystems and land eco-productivity, eco-logical design (creating) can multiply functions and public benefits synergistically. Eco-positive design involves open systems thinking (i.e. with transparent/permeable boundaries).  For example, building rating tools are based on limits or thresholds (borders) and do not contemplate net public gains.  Perhaps because of the deeply-embedded historic elevation of rationalist decision-making over design, green building design templates and rating tools are decision-based.  Being reductionist, they encourage tradeoffs between costs and benefits or nature and society in physical development.  Hence they tend to reduce adaptability, diversity and reversibility.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;There are many critiques of green building rating tools.  Brandon, P.S., and Lombardi, P.L. (2011) ''Evaluating Sustainable Development in the Built Environment'' (2nd ed.) Chichester, West Sussex, Ames, Iowa, Wiley-Blackwell; Gu, Z., Wennersten, R., and Assefa, G. (2006) ‘Analysis of the Most Widely Used Building Environmental Assessment Methods’, ''Environmental Sciences,'' 3(3), pp. 175-192;  Birkeland, J. (2004) ‘Building Assessment Systems: Reversing Environmental Impacts’, Nature and Society Forum, ACT, [[Australia http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland|Australia &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] (accessed 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
Decision systems in governance (i.e. legislative, executive and judicial) resolve conflict by allocating rights and resources - not by increasing the ecological base and/or public estate.  Hence PD suggests different frameworks for environmental governance.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‘The Case for a New Public Forum’, in Furnass, B., Whyte, J., Harris, J., and Baker, A. (Eds), ''Survival, Health and Wellbeing into the 21st Century'', Nature and Society Forum, pp. 111-114.  Birkeland, J. (1995) ‘Ethics-Based Planning’, ''Australian Planner'' 33(1), pp. 47-49.&lt;/ref&gt; These include a modified constitution with a new decision sphere to deal with the unique ethical dimensions of biophysical development, planning and design.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;Birkeland, J. (1993) ‘Towards a New System of Environmental Governance’, in ''The Environmentalist'', 13(1), pp. 19-32;  Birkeland, J. (1993) ''Planning for a Sustainable Society, Ibid''; Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 220-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Given real-world political barriers to change, PD also suggests default strategies to enable incremental reform by changing institutions from within.  PD contends that gaps can be avoided in new governance and planning systems by simply reversing each ecologically terminal convention into eco-positive ones.

== Planning ==
SMARTmode (systems mapping and redesign thinking) is a PD planning process&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 251-173.&lt;/ref&gt; that includes two dozen environment gap analyses to highlight sustainability issues that are almost never assessed in planning or design.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2015) ‘Planning for Positive Development’, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these are forensic ‘flows analyses’ that identify (local/regional) social and ecological deficits that developments could ameliorate by design.  They can be undertaken scientifically using emerging multi-dimensional digital mapping tools,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. and Simpson, R., eds. (2012) ''D_City: Digital Earth, Virtual Nations, Data Cities'', D_City, Sydney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; more pragmatically by design teams,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‘Improving the Design Review Process’, ''CIB Commission Conference Proceedings'', RMIT, Melbourne, pp. 150-155;  Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Systems and Social Change for Sustainable and Resilient Cities’, L. Pearson, P. Newton and P. Roberts (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt; or more subjectively in community ‘charrettes’ (aka working bees) for workshopping planning criteria and design briefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkissian, W. (2002) ‘Pros and cons of design charrettes’, in J. Birkeland (Ed) ''Design for Sustainability: A Sourcebook of Integrated Eco-logical Solutions'', Earthscan, London, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Until planners perform these analyses routinely, therefore, they can serve as design thinking exercises, guidelines and/or criteria.

== Design ==
While improved systems of governance, decision-making and planning can assist, biophysical sustainability is ultimately a design problem. To compensate for past system design errors, fundamental reforms of design methods and processes are required.  PD proposes means to reduce material flows without tradeoffs by, for example, creating mutual gains and ‘low-impact luxury’ environments.&lt;ref&gt;Aesthetics or design quality does not equal high production costs, whereas high-tech equipment usually has high [[embodied energy]].&lt;/ref&gt; PD contends that eco-positive design is already possible, partly through the integration of natural systems with building structures, spaces and surfaces (e.g. ‘[[living machines]]’,&lt;ref&gt;Todd, N.J. and Todd J. (1994) ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines'', Atlantic Books, Berkeley, California;  J. Todd (2002) ‘Living Technologies’, in Birkeland J. (Ed) ''Design for Sustainability: A sourcebook of Integrated Eco-logical Solutions'', Earthscan, London, pp. 114-117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[mycology]],&lt;ref&gt;Stamets, P. (2005) ''Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World'', Ten Speed Press, Berkeley, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘algaetecture’&lt;ref&gt;Algae Industry Magazine (2011), Algaeindustry.com. Accessed August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;). PD contributes other design concepts (e.g. ‘design for eco-services’,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2009) ‘Design for Eco-services’, Part A - Environmental Services, ''Environment Design Guide 77'', and Part B - Building Services, ''Environmental Design Guide 78'', Canberra, Architects Institute of Australia, Canberra, Architects Institute of Australia, pp. 1-13 and pp. 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘green scaffolding’&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Resilient and Sustainable Buildings’, Pearson, L., Newton P., and Roberts P. (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 146-159.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘green space walls’,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ‘Space Frame Walls: Facilitating Positive Development’, in ''Proceedings of the 2008 World Sustainable Building Conference''. Melbourne, Australia, September 22–25.  See also www.sustainability.org.au.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘solar core’ and ‘piggyback roof,&lt;ref&gt;Paten C., Birkeland, J. and Pears A. (2005) ‘Greening the Built Environment’, in Hargroves, C. and Smith, M.H. (Eds) ''The Natural Advantage of Nations'', London, Earthscan, pp. 367-8&lt;/ref&gt; ‘playgardens’&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2002) Playgardens and Community in ''Design for Sustainability; a Sourcebook of Eco-logical Solutions,'' Earthscan, London, pp. 109-112;  Birkeland, J. (1994) ‘Ecofeminist Playgardens’, International Play Journal, Vol. 2, pp. 49-59.&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Design for Eco-services ===
The term ‘ecosystem services’ generally applies only to human benefits, which are usually valued by units (e.g. money, carbon or energy.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. et al. (1997) ‘The Value of the World’sEcosystem Services and Natural Capital’, ''Nature'', vol 387, pp. 253–260;  Heal, G. (2000) ''Nature and the Marketplace: Capturing the Value of Ecosystem Services'', Island Press, Washington, DC; Folke, C. Jansson, Å., Larsson, J. and Costanza, R. (1997) ‘Ecosystem Appropriation by Cities, Ambio Vol 26, pp. 167-172;  Daily, G. and K. Ellison (2002) ''The New Economy of Nature'', Island Press, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; PD uses the term ‘eco-services’ to include not only nature’s instrumental (pragmatic) values like ecosystem goods and services, but its intrinsic (priceless) and ‘biophilic’ values.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1993) ''The Biophilia Hypothesis'', in S. Kellert (Ed) Island Press, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; PD considers the value of nature to be ‘infinite’ as it is not only the basis of the economy, but essential to human existence itself.  To counteract the ecological footprint of existing development,&lt;ref&gt;Wackernagel, M. and Rees W. E. (1996) ''Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing the Human Impact on the Earth'', New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘surplus’ natural and social capital&lt;ref&gt;Surplus in PD means ‘giving back more than it takes’ from a life cycle and whole system perspective, not sending energy or water back to the grid or mains.&lt;/ref&gt; - assessed from fixed biophysical baselines - must be created both off-site and on-site by design.

=== Carbon-neutral Design ===
Net positive energy is barred by the laws of physics.  Moreover, calculations of ‘net energy’ seldom include the embodied energy - let alone ecological impacts incurred during resource extraction, production and transportation.  With substantial passive solar design and renewable energy, buildings can send unused energy back to the grid, but it might be used for unsustainable purposes elsewhere. Nonetheless, a building could sequester more carbon than it emits over its life cycle with substantial building-integrated vegetation, using PD design principles.  A case study (conducted by a cross-disciplinary team) showed this would within under twelve years, well under its life span.&lt;ref&gt;Renger, C., Birkeland, J. and Midmore, D. (2015) ‘Net Positive Building Carbon Sequestration: A Case Study in Brisbane’, in ''Building Research and Information: Special issue'' on net positive design 43(1), pp. 11-24. See also Birkeland, J.L. (2008) ‘Space Frame Walls: Facilitating Positive Development’, in ''Proceedings of the 2008 World Sustainable Building Conference''. Melbourne, Australia, September 22–25, http://trove.nla.gov.au/ accessed June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Reporting ===
The PD eco-positive design reporting process (EDR)&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‘Improving the Design Review Process’, ''CIB Commission Conference Proceedings'', RMIT, Melbourne, pp. 150-155;  Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Systems and Social Change for Sustainable and resilient Cities’, L. Pearson, P. Newton and P. Roberts (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt; aims to avoid many shortcomings of decision-based approaches to design.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 83-96. Rating tools often give credits for things that have financial gains like energy and water savings or worker health and productivity but do not increase the ecology, let alone offset biodiversity impacts. They do not credit actual net positive impacts.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to green building rating tools, the EDR aims to uncover opportunities to create net public gains.  Design teams answer questions based on PD design criteria&lt;ref&gt;''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt; and SMARTmode analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2015) ‘Planning for Positive Development’, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257;  ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 251-273.&lt;/ref&gt; This forces education, collaboration and ‘frontloading’ design (i.e. investing more in preliminary design stages).&lt;ref&gt;See Weizacker, E. van, Lovins, A. and Lovins, H. (1997) ''Factor 4: Doubling Wealth – Halving Resource Use'', Earthscan, London, UK.  Hawken, P., Lovins, A and Lovins, H. (1999) ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution'', Earthscan, London, UK.  It is a widely cited claim that design is only about one percent of the total cost of the building, yet can save fifty to ninety percent of the total operating cost of a building.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing the research and reasoning behind decision and design concepts facilitates input from community, assessors and independent experts, and should therefore occur be undertaken in development project. Being affordable and flexible, it is also easily adapted to developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;An example EDR process was created for Bogota based on a study of cultural, economic, social, ecological and other special needs.  This is not yet published.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Strategies ===
Eco-positive retrofitting is a priority PD strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2009) ‘Eco-Retrofitting with Building Integrated Living’, in ''Smart and Sustainable Built Environment Conference Proceedings''. Delft, Netherlands. www.sasbe2009.com/ accessed May 2011; ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 23-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the massive ongoing impacts of buildings, biophysical sustainability is impossible without retrofitting cities.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP (2013) ''Buildings and Climate Change: Summary for Decision Makers'', United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Nairobi (by United Nations organizations and national building institutes).  UN-HABITAT (2011) ''Cities and Climate Change: Global Report on Human Settlements''. http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/GRHS2011_Full.pdf/ accessed July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Replacing buildings with greener ones costs too much in materials, money, energy and time, as new buildings represent only 1-3% of the building stock.  It is now accepted that retrofitting can be profitable in resource, energy, health savings and worker productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Romm, J. (1999) ''Cool Companies: How the Best Businesses Boost Profits and Productivity by Cutting Greenhouse Emissions'', Island Press, Washington, DC.;  EPA (1998) Market Values for Home Energy Efficiency (study by Nevin and Watson for the USA Environmental Protection Agency), Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; It can happen quickly and simultaneously, or when buildings are repurposed or refurbished anyway.  Green buildings may last a hundred years but few are designed for upgrading/adaptability, so they will soon need retrofitting to a higher standard.

== Design Assessment ==
Most rating tools prioritize resource efficiency and treat ‘reductions in negative impacts’ as if positive.  Their baselines and benchmarks preclude net-positive impacts.  Some provisions consider respective rights/responsibilities, but not broader ethical issues like improving human-nature relationships, reducing total resource flows or increasing social capital in the vicinity. Also, innovation is often valued for its own sake, not outcomes, and eco-efficiency saves owners money anyway. PD’s ‘hierarchy of eco-innovation’ analysis instead prioritizes positive system-wide outcomes and net public benefits.&lt;ref&gt;The PD ‘hierarchy of eco-innovation’ is summarized in Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 240-242.&lt;/ref&gt; Being non-numerical, it allows self-assessment during design when scientific data is unavailable, time and ego has vested or irreversible decisions are made.

=== PD Starfish ===
The PD ‘starfish’ design and rating tool enables quantification while assisting designers to consider more dimensions of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2010) ‘Starfish Tool for Net Positive Design’, Presentation at ''Positive Communities'', DEEDI (Queensland Government), Brisbane;  Birkeland, J. (2012) ‘Design blindness in Sustainable Development: From Closed to Open Systems Design Thinking’, in ''The Journal of Urban Design'', 17(2), 163-187. (Note the tool is elaborated in a forthcoming book).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modified radar diagram with added layers and satellite diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Radar diagrams are standard spreadsheet tools.&lt;/ref&gt; Since most life cycle assessment tools estimate impacts between ‘-1’ (bad) to ‘0’ (best) or zero impact, eco-positive public benefits are excluded.  Unlike rating tools, benchmarks for different sustainability factors are based on fixed biophysical conditions - not typical buildings, sites or practices.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D and R. Simpson (2012) ''D_City: Digital Earth/Virtual Nations/Data Cities - Connecting Global Futures for Environmental Planning'', D. Jackson and R. Simpson, E-book, http://dcitynetwork.net/manifesto/; Birkeland, J. (2012) ‘The Eco-Positive Design Tool’, in ''Solar Progress'', Journal of the Australian Solar Energy Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The starfish uses one scale to assess impacts in relation to fixed benchmarks (from ‘-1’ to ‘+1’) and a linear scale on another layer for scoring/comparison purposes.

[[File:HMS Blanche and Pique.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Blanche|1786|2}} towing ''[[HMS Pique (1795)|Pique]]'', a French frigate captured as a British prize in 1795]]
'''Prize''' {{IPAc-en|p|ɹ|aI|z}} is a term used in [[admiralty law]] to refer to [[Military equipment|equipment]], [[vehicles]], [[Marine vessel|vessels]], and [[cargo]] captured during armed conflict. The most common use of prize in this sense is the capture of an enemy [[ship]] and her [[cargo]] as a [[prize of war]]. In the past, the capturing force would commonly be allotted a share of the [[Prize money|worth]] of the captured prize. Nations often granted [[letters of marque]] that would entitle private parties to capture enemy [[property]], usually ships. Once the ship was secured on friendly territory, she would be made the subject of a prize case, an ''[[in rem]]'' proceeding in which the court determined the status of the condemned property and the manner in which the property was to be disposed of.

==History and sources of prize law==
[[File:Grotius.jpeg|thumb|upright=.75|left|Hugo de Groot, known as [[Grotius]], a 17th-century Dutch academic prodigy known as the Mozart of international law, who wrote the 1604 ''Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty'']]
At the outset, prize taking was all smash and grab "like breaking a jeweler's window", but by the fifteenth century a body of guiding rules, the maritime law of nations, had begun to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' p. 4–5 (on the evolving prize rules in international law).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Grotius's seminal treatise on international law published in 1604 called ''De Iure Praedae Commentarius (Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty)'' (of which Chapter 12, "''Mare Liberum''" inter alia founded the doctrine of freedom of the seas) was an advocate's brief justifying Dutch seizures of Spanish and Portuguese shipping.&lt;ref&gt;Grotius, ''De Iure Praedae Commentarius'' (''Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty'') p. ix (introductory notes describing Grotius's purpose).&lt;/ref&gt; Grotius defends the practice of taking prizes as not merely traditional or customary but just.  His ''Commentary'' points out that the etymology of the name of the Greek war god Ares was the verb "to seize";  that the law of nations had deemed looting enemy property legal since the beginning of Western recorded history in Homeric times.&lt;ref&gt;Grotius, ''De Iure Praedae Commentarius'' (''Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty'') p. 43 (considering property seizure as a species of warfare).&lt;/ref&gt;

Prize law fully developed between the [[Seven Years' War]] of 1756–63 and the [[American Civil War]] of 1861–65. This period largely coincides with the last century of fighting sail and includes the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s, and America's [[Quasi-War]] with France of the late 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' p.  5&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of Anglo-American prize law derives from 18th Century British precedents in particular a compilation called the ''1753 Report of the Law Officers'' authored by [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]] (1705–93) said to be the most important exposition of prize law published in English, along with the subsequent High Court of Admiralty decisions of [[William Scott, Lord Stowell]] (1743–1836).

American Justice [[Joseph Story]], the leading United States judicial authority on prize law, drew heavily on the 1753 report and Lord Stowell's decisions, as did Francis Upton, who wrote the last major American treatise on prize law, his ''Maritime Warfare and Prize''.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the Anglo-American [[common law]] case precedents are the most accessible description of prize law, it is important to bear in mind that in prize cases, courts construe and apply international customs and usages, the  [[Law of Nations]], and not the laws or precedents of any one country.&lt;ref&gt;''The Elsebe'' in Colombos, ''A Treatise on the Law of Prize'' p. 21 (Lord Stowell noting that prize law is matter of international law, not the law of any one nation.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortunes in prize money were to be made at sea as vividly depicted in the novels of [[C. S. Forester]] and [[Patrick O'Brian]]. During the American Revolution the combined American naval and privateering prizes totaled nearly $24&amp;nbsp;million;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/  While the calculation is complex and inexact], adjusted for inflation according to the Consumer Price Index $24 million in the dollars of 1800 computes to approximately $450 million today.&lt;/ref&gt; in the War of 1812, $45&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Maclay, ''A History of American Privateers'', Preface p. ix (totaling captured vessels and prize proceeds).&lt;/ref&gt; Such huge revenues were earned when $200 were a generous year's wages for a sailor;&lt;ref&gt;A ''History of American Privateers'' p.10–11 (comparing prize awards with pay officers and crew)&lt;/ref&gt; his share of a single prize could fetch ten or twenty times his yearly pay, and taking five or six prizes in one voyage was common. 

[[File:Olmsted.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|right|Captain Gideon Olmsted, who at age 20 commandeered the British sloop ''Active'' in a mutiny, and spent the next 30 years litigating a claim for prize money]]

With so much at stake, prize law attracted some of the greatest legal talent of the age, including [[John Adams]], [[Joseph Story]], [[Daniel Webster]] and [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] author of ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]''. Prize cases were among the most complex of the time, as the disposition of vast sums turned on the fluid [[Law of Nations]], and difficult questions of jurisdiction and precedent.

One of the earliest U.S. cases for instance, that of the ''Active'', took fully 30&amp;nbsp;years to resolve [[jurisdiction]]al disputes between state and federal authorities.  A captured American privateer captain, 20-year-old Gideon Olmsted, shipped aboard the British sloop ''Active'' in Jamaica as an ordinary hand in an effort to get home. Olmsted organized a mutiny and commandeered the sloop.  But as Olmsted's mutineers sailed their prize to America, a Pennsylvania privateer took the ''Active''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Gideon Olmsted'' Forward pp. vii to xv (discussing Olmsted's harrowing adventures at sea, followed by a 30 year ordeal in the courts on land).&lt;/ref&gt; Olmsted and the privateer disputed ownership of the prize, and in November 1778 a Philadelphia prize court jury came to a split verdict awarding each a share. Olmsted, with the assistance of then American General [[Benedict Arnold]], appealed to the [[Continental Congress]] Prize Committee, which reversed the Philadelphia jury verdict and awarded the whole prize to Olmsted. But Pennsylvania authorities refused to enforce the decision, asserting the Continental Congress could not intrude on a state prize court jury verdict. Olmsted doggedly pursued the case for decades until he won, in a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case in 1809 which Justice [[Stanley Matthews]] later called "the first case in which the supremacy of the Constitution was enforced by judicial tribunals against the assertion of state authority."&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Bancroft Davis, ''United States Reports, Cases Adjudged in the October Term, 1888'', vol. 131 (New York: Banks &amp; Brothers 1889) app., p. xxxiv n. (quoting U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stanley Matthews on the significance of the ''Active'' case) see also ''Prize Cases Decided in the United States Supreme Court'', Introduction at 5-6 (discussing the ''Active'').&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commission ==
Although [[Letter of marque|Letters of Marque and Reprisal]] were sometimes issued before a formal declaration of war, as happened during the American Revolution when the rebelling colonies of Massachusetts, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania all granted Letters of Marque months before the Continental Congress's official [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of July 1776,&lt;ref&gt;Prize Cases Decided in the United States Supreme Court, Introduction at 2-7(detailing confusion of early state prize courts competing with, and denying the appellate authority of, the Continental Congress's prize court)&lt;/ref&gt; by the turn of the 19th century it was generally accepted that a sovereign government first had to declare war. The "existence of war between nations terminates all legal commercial intercourse between their citizens or subjects," wrote Francis Upton in ''Maritime Warfare and Prize'', since "[t]rade and commerce presuppose the existence of civil contracts … and recourse to judicial tribunals; and this is necessarily incompatible with a state of war." &lt;ref&gt;Upton, ''Maritime Warfare and Prize'', p. 16–17 (discussing cessation of business when war declared).&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, each citizen of a nation "is at war with every citizen of the enemy," which imposes a "duty, on every citizen, to attack the enemy and seize his property, though by established custom, this right is restricted to such only, as are the commissioned instruments of the government."&lt;ref&gt;Upton, ''Maritime Warfare and Prize'', p. 16–17 (discussing implications of state of war).&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal commission bestowed upon a naval vessel, and the Letter of Marque and Reprisal granted to private merchant vessels converting them into naval auxiliaries, qualified them to take enemy property as the armed hands of their sovereign, and to share in the proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' at 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capturing a prize==
[[File:Fighting on the Jeune Richard.jpg|thumb|''Captain Rogers of the ''Windsor Castle'' packet of 150 tons &amp; 28 men capturing the ''Jeune Richard'' French privateer of 250 tons &amp; 92 men, 1807'']]

When a privateer or naval vessel spotted a tempting vessel—whatever flag she flew or often enough flying none at all—they gave chase. Sailing under [[False flag|false colors]] was a common ruse, both for predator and prey. The convention was a vessel must hoist her true colors before firing the first shot. Firing under a false flag could cost dearly in prize court proceedings, even result in restitution to the captured vessel's owner.&lt;ref&gt;Uptown, ''Maritime Warfare and Prize'' p. 421-22 (citing ''The Peacock'', 4 Rob. 185, a British case involving restitution and allocation of expenses after firing under false colors)&lt;/ref&gt;

Often a single cannon shot across the bow was enough to persuade the prey to [[heave-to]], but sometimes brutal hours and even days of cannonading ensued, along with boarding and hand-to-hand fighting with cutlasses, pistols, and boarding pikes. No matter how furious and bloody the battle, once it was over the victors had to collect themselves, put aside anger and exercise forbearance, treating captives with courtesy and civility to the degree prudence allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, ''Maritime Law and Prize'', p. 445 (citing the federal district court case of the ''Louisa Agnes'' which noted indecorous treatment like putting the captured crew in irons might well be defensible as necessary, under the circumstances).&lt;/ref&gt;    Officers restrained the crew to prevent pillaging defeated adversaries, or pilfering the cargo known as breaking bulk. Francis Upton's treatise on ''Maritime Warfare'' cautioned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Embezzlements of the cargo seized, or acts personally violent, or injuries perpetrated upon the captured crew, or improperly separating them from the prize-vessel, or not producing them for examination before the prize-court, or other torts injurious to the rights and health of the prisoners, may render the arrest of the vessel or cargo, as prize, defeasible, and also subject the tort feasor for damages therefore.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, ''Maritime Law and Prize'', p. 445 (quoting the ''Louisa Agnes''  ruling that tort claims for cruelty would require more than just bare affidavit allegations, but pleadings, proof, and opportunity of defense).&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Taking the prize before a prize court might be impractical for any number of reasons like bad weather, shortage of prize crew, dwindling water and provisions, or the proximity of an overpowering enemy force — in which case a vessel might be ransomed.  That is, instead of destroying her on the spot as was their prerogative, the privateer or naval officer would accept a [[scrip]] in form of an [[IOU]] for an agreed sum as ransom from the ship's master. On land this would be [[extortion]] and the promise to pay unenforceable in court,  but at sea it was accepted practice and the IOUs negotiable instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' 13-30 (discussing ransoming of whaleship ''Eliza Swan'').&lt;/ref&gt;

On occasion a seized vessel would be released to ferry home prisoners, a practice which Lord Stowell said "in the consideration of humanity and policy" Admiralty Courts must protect with the utmost attention.&lt;ref&gt;Colombos, ''Law of Prize'' p. 168 (quoting Lord Stowell on cartel ships)&lt;/ref&gt; While on her mission as a [[Cartel (ship)|cartel ship]] she was immune to recapture so long as she proceeded directly on her errand, promptly returned, and did not engage in trading in the meantime.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, ''Maritime Warfare and Prize'' 13-30 (treating of cartel immunity, noting the case of the ship ''Venus'' condemned as a prize for having taken a cargo on board after delivering prisoners to France as a cartel ship ).&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, however, the captor put aboard a  prize crew to sail a captured vessel to the nearest port of their own or an allied country, where a prize court could adjudicate the prize. If while sailing en route a friendly vessel re-captured the prize, called a rescue, the right of ''[[postliminium]]'' declared title to the rescued prize restored to its prior owners. That is, the ship did not become a prize of the recapturing vessel. However, the rescuers were entitled to compensation for [[Marine salvage#Ship salvage and the law|salvage]],&lt;ref&gt;Upton, ''Maritime Law and Prize'',  p. 234-35 (discussing postliminium and salvage).&lt;/ref&gt; just as if they had rescued a crippled vessel from sinking at sea.&lt;ref&gt;''Prize Case Decisions of the United States Supreme Court'' p. 130 (reprinting the 1796 decision in ''The Mary Ford'' that American rescuers who found a wrecked and abandoned French prize adrift without sails or rigging could not condemn her as a prize, but were entitled as salvors to the judge's estimate of fair compensation for time lost, labor, risk taken, and mental and physical suffering, to induce mariners to undertake the peril and expense of rescue at sea).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admiralty Court process==
The prize that made it back to the capturing vessel's country or that of an ally which had authorized prize proceedings would be sued in Admiralty Court  ''in rem'' meaning "against the thing", against the vessel itself. For this reason decisions in prize cases bear the name of the vessel, such as ''The Rapid''  (a U.S. Supreme Court case holding goods bought before hostilities commenced nonetheless become contraband after war is declared)&lt;ref&gt;As cited by Upton, ''Maritime Warfare and Prize'', p. 23 (citing ''The Rapid'', 8 Cranch 155,)&lt;/ref&gt; or ''The Elsebe'' (Lord Stowell holding that Prize Courts enforce rights under the Law of Nations rather than merely the law of their home country).&lt;ref&gt;Colombos, ''A Treatise on the  Law of Prize'' p. 21 (citing Lord Stowell in ''The Elsebe'')&lt;/ref&gt; A proper prize court condemnation was absolutely requisite to convey clear title to a vessel and its cargo to the new owners and settle the matter. According to Upton's treatise, "Even after four years' possession, and the performance of several voyages, the title to the property is not changed without sentence of condemnation".&lt;ref&gt;Upton, ''Maritime Law and Prize'', p. 238 (describing the uniform requirement of a sentence of condemnation.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The agent of the privateer or naval officer brought a [[Libel (admiralty law)|libel]], accusing the captured vessel of belonging to the enemy, or carrying enemy cargo, or running a blockade. Prize commissioners took custody of the vessel and its cargo, and gathered the ship's papers, charts, and other documents. They had a special duty to notify the prize court of perishable property, to be sold promptly to prevent spoilage and the proceeds held for whoever prevailed in the prize proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, ''Maritime Warfare and Prize,'' p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:QW70Betsey1791.jpg|thumb|left| The American vessel ''Betsey'' under attack by a swarm of seven French corsairs, in 1797]]  The commissioners took testimony from witnesses on standard form written [[interrogatories]].&lt;ref&gt;Upton, ''Maritime Warfare and Prize'' (appendix)(reproducing standard form interrogatories for the United States District Court).&lt;/ref&gt;  Admiralty Courts rarely heard live testimony. The commissioners' interrogatories sought to establish the relative size, speed, and force of the vessels, what signals were exchanged and what fighting ensued, the location of the capture, the state of the weather and "the degree of light or darkness," and what other vessels were in sight. That was because naval prize law gave assisting vessels, defined as those that were "in signal distance" at the time, a share of the proceeds. The written interrogatories and ship's papers established the nationality of the prize and her crew, and the origin and destination of the cargo: the vessel was said to be "confiscated out of her own mouth."&lt;ref&gt;Colombos, ''A Treatise on the  Law of Prize'' p. 356 (quoting Sir James Marriott on using a vessel's own papers to condemn her)&lt;/ref&gt;

One considerable difference between prize law and ordinary Anglo-American criminal law is the reversal of the normal  ''onus probandi'' or burden of proof.&lt;ref&gt;Colombos,'' A Treatise on the  Law of Prize'' p. 361 discussing ''onus probandi'')&lt;/ref&gt;   While in criminal courts a defendant is innocent until proven guilty, in prize court a vessel is guilty unless proven innocent.&lt;ref&gt;''Brown v. United States'', reprinted in ''Prizes Cases in the United States Supreme Court'' p. 459 (observing it is "a well known rule of the prize court that the ''onus probandi'' is on the claimant"&amp;mdash;he must prove his own good title before contesting a prize).&lt;/ref&gt; Prize captors need show only "reasonable suspicion" that the property is subject to condemnation; the owner bears the burden of proving the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Colombos, ''A Treatise on the  Law of Prize'' p. 361-62 (observing claimant must show the property is not subject to confiscation, a reversal of the usual presumption of innocence)&lt;/ref&gt;

A prize court normally ordered the vessel and its cargo condemned and sold at auction. But the court's decision became vastly more complicated in the case of neutral vessels, or a neutral nation's cargo carried on an enemy vessel. Different countries treated these situations differently.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' p.161&lt;/ref&gt; By the close of the 18th century, Russia, Scandinavia, France, and the United States had taken the position that "free ships make free goods": that is, cargo on a neutral ship could not be condemned as a prize. But Britain asserted the opposite, that an enemy's goods on a neutral vessel, or neutral goods on an enemy vessel, may be taken,&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' p. 161-2(discussing the international difference of opinion over cargo carried by neutrals)&lt;/ref&gt; a position which prevailed in 19th century practice.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Russell, ''The French Privateers'', p. 195-6 (reviewing contemporary practice on cargo of enemy vessels)&lt;/ref&gt;  The ingenuity of belligerents in evading the law through pretended neutrality, false papers, quick title transfers, and a myriad of other devices, make up the principal business of the prize courts during the last century of fighting sail.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, The Prize Game p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutral vessels could be subject to capture if they ran a blockade. The blockade had to be effective to be cognizable in a prize court, that is, not merely declared but actually enforced. Neutrals had to be warned of it. If so then any ships running the blockade of whatever flag were subject to capture and condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie,'' The Prize Game'' p. 163 (discussing blockade of Charleston and capture and condemnation of blockade runners).&lt;/ref&gt; However passengers and crew aboard the blockade runners were not to be treated as prisoners of war, as Upton's ''Maritime Warfare and Prize'' enjoins: "the penalty, and the sole penalty ... is the forfeiture of the property employed in [blockade running]."  Persons aboard blockade runners could only be temporarily detained as witnesses, and after testifying, immediately released.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, ''Maritime Warfare and Prize'' p. 441 (noting naval captors operating under a "misapprehension" have sometimes treated blockade runners as prisoners of war, which is in error.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The legitimacy of an adjudication depended on regular and just proceedings.  Departures from  internationally accepted standards of fairness risked ongoing litigation by disgruntled shipowners and their insurers, often protracted for decades. 

For example, during America's [[Quasi-War]] with France in the 1790s, corrupt French Caribbean prize courts (often sharing in the proceeds) resorted to pretexts and subterfuges to justify condemning neutral American vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Jock Yellott, ''Not-Quite Justice After Never-Was War: A French Spoliation Case from the Quasi-War'', Sea History Vol. 113 p.16 (Winter 2005-2006)&lt;/ref&gt; They condemned one for carrying alleged English contraband because the compass in the binnacle showed an English brand; another because the pots and pans in the galley were of English manufacture. Outraged U.S. shipowners, their descendants, and descendants of their descendants (often serving as fronts for insurers) challenged these decisions in litigation collectively called the French Spoliation Cases. The Spoliation Cases last over a century, from the 1790's until 1915. Together with Indian tribal claims for treaty breaches, the French Spoliation Cases enjoy the dubious distinction of figuring among the longest-litigated claims in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;Yellott, ''Not-Quite Justice After Never-Was War'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of privateering and the decline of naval prizes==
Most privateering  came to an end in the mid-19th century, when signatories to the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law]] of 1856  at the conclusion of the [[Crimean War]] renounced&lt;ref&gt;Lord Russell of Liverpool, ''The French Corsairs'', p. 197(reciting several anti-privateering provisions in the Declaration and their effect)&lt;/ref&gt; granting letters of marque.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie,'' The Prize Game'' p. 145 (discussing the Convention of 1856 which ended privateering).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The United States however, was not a signatory.&lt;ref&gt;Maclay, ''A History of American Privateers'' p. xxiii (noting the US and Spain declined to sign, though both in effect renounced privateering by subsequent actions even if not in words)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Civil War]], [[Confederate privateer]]s cruised against Union merchant shipping. Likewise the Union (though refusing to recognize the legitimacy of Confederate letters of marque) allowed its navy to take Confederate vessels as prizes. Under US Constitution Article 1 Section 8, it is still theoretically possible for Congress to authorize letters of marque, but in the last 150&amp;nbsp;years it has not done so.

An [[International Prize Court]] was to be set up by treaty XII of the [[Hague Convention of 1907]], but this treaty never came into force as only [[Nicaragua]] ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://verdragenbank.overheid.nl/en/Verdrag/Details/003327|title=Convention relative to the establishment of an International Prize Court|work=Treaty Database|publisher=Government of the Netherlands|language=English|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commerce raiding by private vessels&lt;ref&gt;Maclay, ''History of American Privateers'' p. xxiii (observing the point of privateering is to destroy commerce, which now is a task assigned to the navy)&lt;/ref&gt; ended with the American Civil War, but Navy officers remained eligible for prize money a little while longer. The United States continued paying prizes to naval officers in the [[Spanish–American War]], and only abjured the practice by statute during World War I. The U.S. prize courts adjudicated no cases resulting from its own takings in either World War I or World War II (although the Supreme Court did rule on a German prize—[[The S. S. Appam|''Appam'']]—that was brought to and held at [[Hampton Roads]]).&lt;ref&gt;Colombos, ''A Treatise on the Law of Prize'' p. 21 (noting that in the US all captures now inure to the state, but none adjudiated in either World War I or II).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise Russia, Portugal, Germany, Japan, China, Romania, and France followed the United States in World War I, declaring they would no longer pay prize money to naval officers. On November 9, 1914, the British and French governments signed an agreement establishing government jurisdiction over prizes captured by either of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1915/2 Convention Relating to Prizes Captured during the Present European War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927034233/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1915/2 |date=2012-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian government acceded to this agreement on March 5, 1915,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1915/4 Text of Russian letter of accession] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927034257/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1915/4 |date=2012-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Italian government followed suit on January 15, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1917/6 Text of Italian letter of accession] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927034403/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1917/6 |date=2012-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before World War II France passed a law which allowed for taking prizes, as did the Netherlands and Norway, though the German invasion and subsequent capitulation of all three of those countries quickly put this to an end.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Britain formally ended the eligibility of naval officers to share in prize money in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Colombos, ''A Treatise on the Law of Prize'' p. 338 (noting abolition of prize money for British naval officers in the Prize act of 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under contemporary international law and treaties, nations may still bring enemy vessels before their prize courts, to be condemned and sold. But no nation now offers a share to the officers or crew who risked their lives in the capture:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Self-interest was the driving force that compelled men of the sea to accept the international law of prize ... [including merchants] because it brought a valuable element of certainty to their dealings. If the rules were clear and universal, they could ship their goods abroad in wartime, after first buying insurance against known risks. ... On the other side of the table, those purchasing vessels and cargoes from prize courts had the comfort of knowing that what they bought was really theirs. The doctrine and practice of maritime prize was widely adhered to for four centuries, among a multitude of sovereign nations, because adhering to it was in the material interest of their navies, their privateersmen, their merchants and bankers, and their sovereigns. Diplomats and international lawyers who struggle in this world to achieve a universal rule of law may well ponder on this lesson.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''The Prize Game'', pp. 145–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pubilla''' ({{IPA-ca|puˈβiʎə}}; plural ''pubilles'') in ancestral [[Catalan tradition]] was the female that would inherit the whole rural estate  in the absence of a brother.

==Tradition==
She was the female version of the [[heir|hereu]] or male heir of the whole property of the family. Traditionally, when a couple had no son, the eldest girl of the family would inherit the home and the estate in ancient [[Catalonia]]. The purpose was not to divide estates that were already too small to exploit in a profitable manner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3773351 JSTOR: Corporate Household and Ecocentric Kinship Group in Catalonia]&lt;/ref&gt;

From mid 20th century onwards the image of the pubilla underwent a change; in present times the pubilla has a role similar to a local [[beauty queen]] in local popular celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpunt.cat/noticia/article/2-societat/5-societat/83241-ambaixadors-del-seu-poble.html?piwik_campaign=rss&amp;piwik_kwd=canals Una pubilla no és una "miss"] d'Ariadna Ventura, publicat a ''[[El Punt]]'' del 30 de setembre de 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes the female ''[[gegants]]'' are dressed as a pubilla, like in [[Manresa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mainlymorrisdancing.org.uk/Giants/manresa.html Pubilla gegant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817145100/http://www.mainlymorrisdancing.org.uk/Giants/manresa.html |date=2010-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the naming of a pubilla is a good occasion for a Catalan girl to dress in the traditional costume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubillatge.com/public/php/auques/auca_dela_pubilla/ Auca de la pubilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717070600/http://www.pubillatge.com/public/php/auques/auca_dela_pubilla/ |date=2007-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page 15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lanka Sundaram. Mughal Land Revenue System. Stokowski Press. 2007. Page 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Qanungoh Shaikhs today are the descendants of families who held the hereditary office of ‘’Qanungoh’’ during the Muslim period.

The Qanungoh have tribal and marital affinities with varied regional groups such as the [[Kukhran]], [[Muslim Rajputs]], [[Muslim Kayasths]], [[Mohyal]] Brahmins, [[Awan (Pakistan)|Awan]], and [[Khattar (tribe)|Khattar]] as well as [[Rohillas]], [[Rind (tribe)|Rind]] and [[Gardezi]] and also [[Kakkezai]] in the [[Jullunder]] area. Some people known as Shiekhkhel are also said to have been the Qanungoh in [[North Waziristan]]. A small number of Qanungoh Shaikh also live in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].

Qanungoh Shaikhs belong to all the districts of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] as well as some districts in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Sarhad]] and [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] provinces, although can be found in small numbers in [[Paktika]] and [[Khost]] provinces in [[Afghanistan]] where they are sometimes referred to as [[Hindki]]. A minority of Qanungoh Shaikhs adhere to the [[Shia]] Islam whilst others originating in lower Punjab and Baluchistan are [[Sunni]] and may belong to various [[Sufi]] orders. Some Qanungo Shaikhs have also been known to be of the [[Zikri]] denomination.

Qanungoh Shaikhs even today remain influential and amongst most literate elements of Pakistani society. Many well-known political figures and other great academics have arisen from the Qanungo Shaikhs, examples being Sessions Judge [[Khan (title)#Noble and honorary titles|Khan Bahadur]] Maulvi Imam Ali, [[Chaudhry Muhammad Sharif|Justice Chaudhry Muhammad Sharif]], the former [[President of Pakistan]] [[Wasim Sajjad]], the lawyer and jurist [[Abdul Qadir (Muslim leader)|Sir Abdul Qadir]], his son [[Manzur Qadir|Manzoor Qadir]] who drafted the first constitution of Pakistan, [[Sheikh Anwarul Haq]] and also Shaikh Aftab Ahmed who is the [[Member of Parliament#Pakistan|MNA]] from [[Attock]] amongst many others.

==Origins==
Qanungoh Shaikhs are the descendants of the Muslim Qanungohs of what is now Pakistan who are [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] Shaikh and often retain their tribal or familial names.

The title of Qanungoh appeared in the Sub-Continent between 1270 and 1290 owing to migrations of the minor Arab aristocracy prompted by [[Hulegu Khan]]'s destruction of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in [[Baghdad]]. The hereditary office of the Qanungoh was well established and instituted during the [[Khalji dynasty]]. The loose [[suzerainty]] of the [[Mamluk]] [[Caliphs]] over the Khaljis served as a further conduit for the movement of literate people from Central Asia and the Middle East to the [[Delhi Sultanate]] to serve as administration over the local populace.&lt;ref&gt;Rehman. M.M. Encyclopaedia of Historiography.Anmol Publications Pvt. Ltd. 2006. Pages 68-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their office continued and was greatly extended under the [[Mughals]].&lt;ref&gt;Lanka Sundaram. Mughal Land Revenue System. Stokowski Press. 2007. Pages 51 and 86.&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of Qanungoh Shaikhs, the northern expansion of the Mughal empire particularly under [[Akbar]] resulted in people representing largely [[Khatri]] and other Punjabi tribes as well as some [[Baluch people|Baluch]] and [[Pakhtoon]] tribes acquiring the title of Qanungoh. This was a golden age for the Qanungoh and these groups through marital and political affiliation collectively instituted and integrated the Qanungoh Shaikhs as a powerful and wealthy clan. From the early 15th Century onwards a small number of [[Sikhs]] also joined the Qanungoh, the descendants of whom became the Rulers of [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]].&lt;ref&gt;Lepel. H.G. Sir. Charles Francis Massy. The Panjab Chiefs: Historical and Biographical Notices of the Principal families in the Lahore and Rawalpindi divisions of the Panjab. {{ISBN|978-969-35-1658-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the British period the Qanungoh continued in their hereditary office although their importance declined particularly following the [[Indian Mutiny]]. As their influence waned during this period they were popularly portrayed as corrupt, debauched and tyrannical.&lt;ref name="Lanka Sundaram 2007. Page 15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calcutta Review Vol. XI University of Calcutta. Jan-June 1849 (2). Page.380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mishra.Hare Krishna. Bureaucracy under the Mughals, 1556 A.D. to 1707 A.D. Amar Prakashan, 1989. Page 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British subsequently and for recentness and lack of information, partially and inaccurately chronicled the Qanungoh Shaikhs as follows:

{{Centered pull quote|Qanungo, lit . 'an expounder of law '. The [[title]] of a family in Karnal who were originally engaged in commerce at Joli . One member of the family was appointed Qanungo of [[Karnal]] and the family then settled there. Originally [[Mahajan]] by caste, its founder Maidi Mal had a son Rai Mal, ancestor of the present Qanungo family, but he subsequently embraced Islam and his son Shaikh Tayab by a Muhammadan wife rose to the rank of Wazir at the Mughal court and to have obtained his brothers appointment as Qanungo. Qanungo families are also found in [[Hoshiarpur]] where a family of Jirath Khatris who were one Qanungos of Bajwara in Mughal times :in Gujarat :in Jullundur at which town there was an old [[Sahgal]] [[Khatri]] family which held the office and is now partly Mohummadan.&lt;ref name="Rose. H.A 1996. Page 257"/&gt;}}

The Gazetteer of the Attock District 1930 records that [[Attock District]] had a significant population of Shaikhs.

{{Centered pull quote|The Shaikhs of Tagall and Saman represent the old kanungo families. The majority are in Government service, or have relatives so situated. They are good cultivators or careful managers, and in (the) Chhachh largely cultivate their own lands. Their social position is not high, and they have lost much by their litigations. They are divided into two parties. Of the Wilayati party, Shaikh Ahmed Khan, Shaikh Fateh Khan, and their other brothers have set a fine example in constructing at their own expense a local dispensary, and a delightful Child Welfare centre, in recognition of the work done to regenerate the Chel area and to bring health and happiness to the children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gazetteer of the Attock District 1930. Sang-E-Meel Publications. 1932. Page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After independence of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, nearly all Qanungoh Shaikh of [[Punjab (India)|East Punjab]], [[Haryana]] and other parts of [[North India|northern India]] escaped from [[pogrom]]s and [[genocide]] in India and settled in Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

'''Raoul Charles, Baron van Caenegem''' (Ghent, 14 July 1927 – 15 June 2018), was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] historian and noted expert in the field of European legal history. 

==Biography==
He was a professor at the city's [[University of Ghent|public university]]. In 1974, he was awarded the [[Francqui Prize]] in [[human sciences]] for his work on [[medieval history]]. 
He studied the history of continental and English common law, and why they diverged so sharply. He revealed the significance of power struggles between the judiciary, legislators, and legal scholars. He wrote in Dutch and English, with some of his most notable works being translated into other European languages.

Van Caenegem became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/3972?set_language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129200045/https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/3972?set_language=en |title=R.C. Van Caenegem |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |archive-date=29 January 2016 |accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 he was awarded the title of baron.&lt;ref&gt;[https://standenenlanden.blogspot.com/2018/06/in-memoriam-raoul-van-caenegem.html Obituary] on the blog of Standen &amp; Landen - Anciens Pays et Assemblées d'États.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|remand}}
The '''remand court procedure''' is used by higher courts to send cases back to lower courts for further action. 

In the [[law of the United States]], [[appellate court]]s remand cases to district courts for actions such as a [[new trial]]. [[Federal judiciary of the United States|Federal]] appellate courts, including the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], have the power to "remand [a] cause and ... require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances."&lt;ref name="title-28"&gt;{{USC|28|2106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the power to make summary "grant, vacate and remand" or [[GVR order]]s.&lt;ref name="lawrence"&gt;''Lawrence v. Chater'', {{ussc|516|163|1996}} (per curiam), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Appellate courts remand cases whose outcome they are unable to finally determine. For example, cases may be remanded when the appellate court decides that the trial judge committed a procedural error, excluded admissible [[evidence (law)|evidence]], or ruled improperly on a motion.

In [[common law]] jurisdictions, remand refers to the [[adjournment]] ([[continuance]]) of [[criminal law|criminal]] proceedings, when the [[Accused (law)|accused]] is either [[remand (detention)|remanded in custody]] or on [[bail]]. Appellate courts are said to remit matters to lower courts for further consideration.

==Details==
{{anchor|United States}}When the [[United States Supreme Court]] grants ''[[certiorari]]'' and reverses a decision of a state supreme court or a Federal appeals court, it may remand the case. Likewise, an appeals court may remand a case to a trial court. A remand may be a full remand, essentially ordering an entirely new [[trial]]; when an appellate court grants a full remand, the lower court's decision is "reversed and remanded."

Alternatively, it may be "with instructions" specifying, for example, that the lower court must use a different legal standard when considering facts already entered at trial. A partial remand occurs when an appellate court affirms a [[conviction]] while directing the lower court to revisit the [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] phase of the trial. Finally, it may remand a case upon concluding that the lower court made a mistake and also did not adjudicate issues that must be considered.

A federal court may also remand when a [[civil case]] is filed in a [[State court (United States)|state court]] and the [[defendant]] [[removal jurisdiction|removes]] the case to the local [[federal district court]]. If the federal court decides that the case was not one in which removal was permissible, it may remand the case to state court. Here, the federal court is not an appellate court as in the case above, and the case was remanded because the removal to the federal court was improper.

In [[federal tribunals in the United States]], it is possible for an [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] court to remand a case to an [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] court (if the case was originally decided by the Article I court and then appealed to the Article III court),&lt;ref&gt;Examples: {{USCFR|20|404|983}}&amp;ndash;{{USCFR|20|404|984}} and {{USCFR|20|416|1483}}&amp;ndash;{{USCFR|20|416|1484}}, pertaining to the remand of cases from the [[United States Federal courts]] to the [[Social Security Administration]]'s Office of Disability Adjudication and Review.&lt;/ref&gt; or for a higher-level administrative tribunal within an executive agency to remand a case to a lower-level tribunal within the same agency.&lt;ref&gt;Examples: {{USCFR|20|404|977}} and {{USCFR|20|416|1477}}, pertaining to the remand of cases from the Appeals Council in the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review of the [[Social Security Administration]] to an [[administrative law judge]] of the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review in the Social Security Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Article III courts are allowed to remand a case back to Article I courts, there is a recent trend divesting magistrate judges from the power to remand cases back to state court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Flam v. Flam|vol= |reporter= |opinion=12-17285 |pinpoint= |court= 9th Cir.|date= June 8, 2015|url= http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/06/08/12-17285.pdf|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same statutory basis for divesting magistrate judges of their power to remand may logically be applied to Article I judges.

The '''Romanian presidential [[impeachment]] [[referendum]]''' of '''2007''' was conducted in order to determine whether the president of [[Romania]] [[Traian Băsescu]] should be forced to step down.

On 19 April 2007 the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian parliament]] suspended Băsescu.&lt;ref name=Suspend&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6572003.stm "Romania's MPs suspend president"]'' "[[BBC News]]'', 19 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/24/europe/EU-POL-Romania-Presidential-Referendum.php Referendum on whether to impeach Romanian president to be held 19 May - International Herald Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Constitutional Court of Romania]] acknowledged the Parliament's vote on the following day,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn//20/eng20070420_.html "Romanian Constitutional Court confirms suspension of president from post"]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]]'', 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Băsescu remained suspended from the position of president until the referendum would clarify the situation. It took place on 19 May 2007 and confirmed that the impeachment should not stand. 24.75% voted to impeach Băsescu, while 74.48% wanted to keep him in office.

Although not impeached, Băsescu is the first president in the history of Romania who has been officially suspended.

== Impeachment vote by Parliament ==
In early 2007, Băsescu was proposed for impeachment by the members of the opposition parties for allegedly unconstitutional conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/arhiva_avt/3542.pdf |accessdate=February 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111232/http://www.hotnews.ro/arhiva_avt/3542.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major issues in the confrontation was the activity of justice minister [[Monica Macovei]], who politicized the prosecutors appointment, taking it away from the Superior Council of Magistrature and assigning it to herself and the president. Among the main reasons given in the proposal to suspend Băsescu were:
* Infringing upon and "substituting the authority" of the government, the judicial system and the parliament.
* Committing acts of "political partisanship" with direct reference to the Democratic Party, abuse of power and acting more like a "judge of the other public authorities" than a "collaborator", thus "abandoning his role of impartial mediator required by the Romanian constitution."
* Manipulating and "instigating public opinion against other state institutions" such as the parliament and the government.
Băsescu and his supporters denied the accusations, stating that his actions and statements were ways of fighting against corruption in the political and judicial systems and against "circles of business interests" with unlawful purposes.

The [[Constitutional Court of Romania]] found no clear evidence of his breach of the constitution in the sense required by the fundamental law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/arhiva_avt/3796.pdf |accessdate=February 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710204803/http://www1.hotnews.ro/arhiva_avt/3796.pdf |archivedate=July 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the court ruling was only consultative and the two chambers of the parliament voted in favor of Băsescu's impeachment on 19 April 2007, with 322 votes for the impeachment proposal, 108 against it and 8 abstentions (the minimum number of votes needed was 233).&lt;ref name=RFE&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/04/F0E882A3-CDB4-40EF-B829-112E105418E1.html "Romanian Parliament Suspends President"], [[Radio Free Europe]]/Radio Liberty, 19 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Băsescu contested the decision, but the constitutional court rejected his appeal as inadmissible and upheld the vote.

In the meantime, Macovei and several other ministers which supported the president were dismissed by prime minister Popescu-Tăriceanu, while the [[European Parliament election, 2007 (Romania)|European election]] has been postponed until at least the fall of 2007. The pro-president media have characterized the anti-Băsescu coalition as the "black alliance," noting that it contained both Social-Democrats and National-Liberals, Hungarian minority MPs and ultra-nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=10373&amp;art=27665&amp;diraut=35&amp;cHash=ac2738bffb Cotidianul - Comentarii - Care „popor“?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the impeachment vote by the parliament, Băsescu was suspended from his function as president on April 19, 2007&lt;ref name=Suspend/&gt; and a national referendum was held on 19 May 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_70361-UPDATE-Nicolae-Vacaroiu-este-presedintele-interimar-al-Romaniei-Referendumul-pentru-demiterea-presedintelui-va-avea-loc-pe-20-mai.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111631/http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_70361-UPDATE-Nicolae-Vacaroiu-este-presedintele-interimar-al-Romaniei-Referendumul-pentru-demiterea-presedintelui-va-avea-loc-pe-20-mai.htm |date=2007-09-29 }} (Hotnews.ro article)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_70595-Referendumul-pentru-demiterea-lui-Basescu-poate-avea-loc-pe-19-mai.htm |title=HotNews.ro - Referendumul pentru demiterea lui Băsescu poate avea loc pe 19 mai - Arhiva noiembrie 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2009-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008234144/http://hotnews.ro/articol_70595-Referendumul-pentru-demiterea-lui-Basescu-poate-avea-loc-pe-19-mai.htm |archive-date=2007-10-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to decide by popular vote whether to dismiss the president. According to the electoral law (article 5(2) of the referendum law), an absolute majority of all Romanians with the right to vote is required for a positive result in a dismissal referendum, which means that almost nine million people would have had to vote against Băsescu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realitatea.net/index.php?domeniu=1&amp;stire=56615 Pentru demitere sunt necesare circa 9 milioane de voturi - Realitatea TV - Politică&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise he would regain full prerogatives. If Băsescu had been dismissed by the referendum, early presidential elections would have been called.

The question printed on the ballots was, "Do you agree with the removal of the President of Romania, Mr. Traian Băsescu, from office?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/arhiva_avt/3825.pdf |accessdate=April 24, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221411/http://www.hotnews.ro/arhiva_avt/3825.pdf |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The question was modified to include the name of the president even though article 9 in the law of referendum already established the content of the question without names of presidents.

==Controversy==
After the impeachment vote by the parliament, several public [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2007#Support Rallies for Băsescu|rallies]] to support Băsescu in the referendum and protest against his suspension were organized by PD and PLD both in Romania (Bucharest, [[Iaşi]] etc.) as well as abroad (e.g. in [[Madrid]]).

On 17 April Băsescu stated that if Parliament voted for his impeachment, he would resign "five minutes" after the vote, avoiding a referendum for dismissal and triggering early presidential elections. However, on 20 April he decided not to resign, claiming he wished to limit the period of political instability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ro/?_RID=det&amp;tb=date&amp;id=8704&amp;_PRID= Preşedintele României&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.hotnews.ro/Suspended-President-Traian-Basescu-says-he%27s-not-resigning-as-president-calls-people-to-referendum-articol_44781.htm HotNews.ro - Anghelescu era deprimat - Arhiva noiembrie 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Băsescu and his supporters in the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] also suggested that his political opponents would try to modify the electoral law in order to obstruct a previously suspended president to run in the elections again,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.hotnews.ro/Opposition-plans-to-change-electoral-law-to-prevent-Traian-Basescu-from-running-again-for-Presidency-articol_44775.htm HotNews.ro - Finantare guvernamentala pentru programul Marco Polo - Arhiva noiembrie 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; following a [[Rolandas Paksas]] scenario.

On 25 April, the constitutional court approved the modifications brought by parliament to the referendum law. The new article 10 (regarding the presidential impeachment process) considers that the impeachment process "will be approved through the majority of votes for the participants at the referendum and article 5(2) does not apply to this type of referendum." Therefore, the 19 May referendum remained valid, despite the participation of less than 40% of eligible Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccr.ro/default.aspx?lang=EN |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912165307/http://www.ccr.ro/default.aspx?lang=EN |archivedate=2012-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since only a 25% minority of voters voted in the affirmative, Băsescu regained full prerogatives on May 24, after the referendum results were confirmed.

===Validity in Case of Low Voter Turnout===
[[Image:Entree ambasade roumanie referendum 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|right|People voting in [[Paris]] before the closure of voting booths.]]
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}
{{Refimprove|date=April 2007}}

On 24 April, the [[Parliament of Romania|parliament]] voted to organize the referendum on 19 May and included an amendment of the opposition which stipulated that in case the [[Constitutional Court of Romania|constitutional court]] found the referendum invalid, parliament would decide on further procedures.

The decision started a new debate on the referendum issue generated by the law not providing for the hypothesis that the referendum to dismiss the president would be considered formally not valid by the constitutional Law on account of low turnout. According to paragraph (2) of article 5 in the law no. 3/2000, a referendum is valid only if the majority of citizens registered in the electoral lists participates in the referendum, regardless of their votes or the validity of their votes once they have participated. This condition applies to all referendums and only if met, the referendum will be held as formally valid by the constitutional court. But neither the constitution nor the law on referendums give any solution to the invalidity issue as to what would happen afterwards with the legal effects of the suspension vote or the re-instatement of the president with full prerogatives.

Supporters of the idea that the referendum will have to be repeated - with the president suspended in the meantime - base their claim on article 95 in the constitution which does not provide a limit in time as to the effects of a suspension vote by the parliament.

Another difficulty that arose from this argument is that a suspension vote would actually become a dismissal vote in case of low voter turnout since several referendums would have to be held with the president suspended while article 95 says that only "a referendum" will be held and this will be done only "in 30 days" from the day of suspension. In addition, it was claimed that it cannot be reasonably inferred that low voter turnout equals a will to dismiss the president by the people and parliament does not have the power to make this decision either.

Supporters of the president rebut the argument, stating that article 95 calls for a referendum to be held in 30 days to dismiss the president by popular vote and that article 8 in the law on referendums states that the referendum is mandatory. Since the referendum is the expression of national sovereignty that belongs to the Romanian people, only a positive result to dismiss the president will preclude Băsescu from regaining full prerogatives once the referendum is held at the date established. Save for a positive result to dismiss him, Băsescu will regain full prerogatives the next day after the vote, regardless of participation rates or the validity of the referendum. This argument does not address the issue of the time limit for the suspension or that a valid referendum will have to legitimize again the reinstatement as president once he was suspended because only a valid referendum is the expression of national sovereignty not an invalid one.

Should the referendum be invalid on account of low voter turnout, a possible solution to this [[constitutional crisis]] would be a bolder decision of the constitutional court that would have to address the debate directly and issue a decision on reinstatement as well. A second possible solution is for the government to repeal the text of article 5 (2) on participation requirements through an emergency ordinance. Finally, resignation of the president would end his mandate and the issue by triggering presidential elections.

===Support Rallies for Băsescu===
After he was suspended, Băsescu took part in several support rallies in which he continued to criticize the 322 MPs who had voted against him and made reference to an alleged conspiracy of corrupt political leaders and a "business oligarchy" that led to his impeachment. He also stated that he would not "negotiate" with his adversaries in order to maintain his office and that he would continue to fight against corruption once reinstated by the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realitatea.net/56891_Traian-Basescu--Mergeti-la-vot-si-votati-asa-cum-va-dicteaza-constiinta-.html Traian Basescu: Mergeti la vot si votati asa cum va dicteaza constiinta - Realitatea TV - Politică&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425040001/http://www.realitatea.net/56891_Traian-Basescu--Mergeti-la-vot-si-votati-asa-cum-va-dicteaza-constiinta-.html |date=2007-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Băsescu's political opponents replied by accusing him of always "seeking conflict" and "inventing enemies" in order to maintain a favourable public image of "fighter for justice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realitatea.net/56957_Discursul-lui-Traian-Basescu-din-Piata-Constitutiei-a-atras-critici-din-partea-PNL-si-PSD-.html Discursul lui Traian Basescu din Piata Constitutiei a atras critici din partea PNL si PSD - Realitatea TV - Politică&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509173756/http://www.realitatea.net/56957_Discursul-lui-Traian-Basescu-din-Piata-Constitutiei-a-atras-critici-din-partea-PNL-si-PSD-.html |date=2007-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mircea Geoană]], leader of the opposition [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] stated that Băsescu's participation in the rallies was illegal because "it took place before the official start of the electoral campaign for the referendum."

Early exit polls indicated a win for the president. Voter turnout had been low, a fact emphasized by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070519/ap_on_re_eu/romania_president],{{dead link|date=December 2013}} Yahoo!

Two exit polls were conducted among the participants in the referendum. An ''Insomar/Metro Media'' poll showed 75 percent of voters saying ''"No"'' to ousting Băsescu. A ''CURS Institute'' poll put the figure at 78.1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Herald Tribune]], [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/19/europe/EU-GEN-Romania-Referendum-Polls.php 2007/05/19/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070519.wromaniapres0519/BNStory/International/home "Romanian president survives referendum on impeachment"], [[Associated Press]], May 19, 2007 at 1:37 PM EDT&lt;/ref&gt;

A common statement by the European Popular Party leaders [[Joseph Daul]] and [[Wilfried Martens]], published one hour after the result of the vote "welcomes the decision of the Romanian people in today’s referendum to reject a call to remove president Traian Basescu from office".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.hotnews.ro/European-Popular-Party-welcomes-Romania's-decision-on-President-Basescu-articol_45019.htm HotNews.ro, 19 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC News]] reported on the population's attitude by citing the answer from a teacher's interview ''"I've got sick of living in a country run by thieves.

Over 50% presence was registered only in Bucharest (where the votes of Romanians living abroad were added to the local votes), Sibiu, Braşov and Constanţa counties. The highest percentage favouring impeachment was registered at Botoşani (39,69%), Teleorman (37,27%), Vaslui (35,34%) and Olt (35,53%)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.becreferendum2007.ro/document3/refer_judete.pdf Referendum results by counties]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sexting.jpg|thumb|A simulated sexting conversation using early Renaissance artist [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]''.]]

'''Sexting''' is sending, receiving, or forwarding [[sexually explicit]] messages, photographs, or images, primarily between mobile phones, of oneself to others. It may also include the use of a computer or any digital device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salter|first=Michael|year=2013|title=Beyond Criminalisation and Responsibilitisim Sexting, Gender and Young People|url=|journal=Sydney Law School|volume=24|pages=310–315|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was first popularized early in the 21st century and is a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Human sexual activity|sex]]'' and ''[[text messaging|texting]]'', where the latter is meant in the wide sense of sending a text possibly with images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Redmond | first = Teresa |url = http://www.northjersey.com/news/education/84932002_Parents__students_get__the_4-1-1_on_sexting_.html|title = Ringwood community addresses sexting|accessdate = 30 May 2010 |date = 22 February 2010 |work =NorthJersey.com |publisher = North Jersey Media Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, the word ''sexting'' was listed for the first time in [[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's ''Collegiate Dictionary'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Italie|first=Leanne|title=F-bomb makes it into mainstream dictionary|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/13/f-bomb-makes-it-mainstream-dictionary/|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The first published use of the term ''sexting'' was in a 2005 article in the Australian ''[[The Sunday Telegraph (Sydney)|Sunday Telegraph Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="SunTele"&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Yvonne |title=The one and only |date=31 July 2005 &lt;!--|accessdate=14 January 2009--&gt; |page=22| work =[[The Sunday Telegraph (Sydney)|Sunday Telegraph Magazine]]| publisher =[[News Corp Australia]]|location=Sydney, Australia |quote=Following a string of extramarital affairs and several lurid "sexting" episodes, Warne has found himself home alone, with Simone Warne taking their three children and flying the conjugal coop.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pew Research Center]] commissioned a study on sexting, which divides the practice into three types:&lt;ref name="Lenhart 2009"/&gt;
# Exchange of images solely between two romantic partners.
# Exchanges between partners that are shared with others outside the relationship.
# Exchanges between people who are not yet in a relationship, but where at least one person hopes to be.
Sexting has become more common with the rise in [[camera phone]]s and [[smartphone]]s with Internet access, that can be used to send explicit photographs as well as messages.&lt;ref name="Lenhart 2009"/&gt; While sexting is done by people of all ages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McDaniel | first1 = Brandon T. | last2 = Drouin | first2 = Michelle | author-link2 = Michelle Drouin | title = Sexting among married couples: who is doing it, and are they more satisfied? | journal = Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking | volume = 18 | issue = 11 | pages = 628–634 | doi = 10.1089/cyber.2015.0334 | pmid = 26484980 | pmc = 4642829 | date = November 2015 | ref = none }}&lt;/ref&gt; most media coverage fixates on negative aspects of adolescent usage. Young adults use the medium of the text message much more than any other new media to transmit messages of a sexual nature,&lt;ref name="Drouin 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Drouin | first1 = Michelle | last2 = Vogel | first2 = Kimberly N. | last3 = Surbey | first3 = Alisen | last4 = Stills | first4 = Julie R. | author-link1 = Michelle Drouin | title = Let's talk about sexting, baby: computer-mediated sexual behaviors among young adults | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = A25–A30 | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.030 | date = September 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and teenagers who have unlimited text messaging plans are more likely to receive sexually explicit texts.&lt;ref name="Lenhart 2009"&gt;{{cite report|last=Lenhart|first=Amanda|title=Teens and sexting|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2009/12/15/teens-and-sexting/ | publisher = [[Pew Research Center|Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] |date=15 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2009/PIP_Teens_and_Sexting.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of sexting being a relatively recent practice, [[ethics]] are still being established by both those who engage in it and those who create legislation based on this concept. Whether sexting is seen as a positive or negative experience typically rests on the basis of whether or not consent was given to share the images. Nevertheless, Australian laws currently view under-18s as being unable to give consent to sexting, even if they meet the legal age for sexual consent.&lt;ref name="Beyond Megan"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Kath |last1=Albury |first2=Kate |last2=Crawford | title = Sexting, consent and young people's ethics: beyond ''Megan's Story'' | journal = [[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]] | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 463–473 | doi = 10.1080/10304312.2012.665840 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{where?|reason= where do such laws apply?|date=May 2015}}

=== Social media applications ===
[[File:Snapchat (15021193310).jpg|thumb|[[Snapchat]] and other applications have been used by teens as another medium of sexting]]

Sexting has been promoted further by several direct messaging applications that are available on smartphones. The difference between using these applications and traditional texting is that content is transmitted over the Internet or a data plan, allowing anyone with Internet access to participate. Kik and WhatsApp appeal to teens because of the anonymity of the applications. Snapchat appeals to teens because it allows users to send photos for a maximum of ten seconds before they self-destruct. Those sending photos over Snapchat believe they will disappear without consequences so they feel more secure about sending them. There have been several cases where teens have sent photos over these applications, expecting them to disappear or be seen by the recipient only, yet are saved and distributed, carrying social and legal implications. Even though users believe their photos on Snapchat for example will go away in seconds, it is easy to save them through other photo capturing technology, third party applications, or simple screenshots. These applications claim no responsibility for explicit messages or photos that are saved. Snapchat's privacy policy on sexting has evolved to include sending content over new smartphone applications because of their appealing features such as the anonymity or temporary elements. Unfortunately these applications carry the same risks and consequences that have always existed.

==== Snapchat ====
A 2009 study found that 4 percent of teenagers aged 14–17 claim to have sent sexually explicit photos of themselves. Fifteen percent of these teens also claimed to have received sexually explicit photos. This suggests a consent issue of people receiving photos without asking for them. This is enhanced with [[Snapchat]], as the person receiving snapchats will not be aware of the contents until they open it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lenhard|first1=Amanda|title=Teens and Sexting How and why minor teens are sending sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude images via text messaging.|url=http://www.ncdsv.org/images/pewinternet_teensandsexting_12-2009.pdf|website=pewinternet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although sexting through Snapchat is popular, "joke sexting" is more prevalent among users. Sending sexual images as a joke makes up approximately a quarter of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Utz | first1 = S. | last2 = Muscanell | first2 = N. | last3 = Khalid | first3 = C. | year = 2015 | title = Snapchat Elicits More Jealousy than Facebook: A Comparison of Snapchat and Facebook Use | url = | journal = Cyberpsychology, Behavior &amp; Social Networking | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 141–146 | doi = 10.1089/cyber.2014.0479 | pmid = 25667961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Sexting is a prevalent and normalized practice among youth in many western, liberal democracies.&lt;ref name="yeungth,etal."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yeung | first1 = Timothy H. | last2 = Horyniak | first2 = Danielle R. | last3 = Vella | first3 = Alyce M. | last4 = Hellard | first4 = Margaret E. | last5 = Lim | first5 = Megan S.C. | title = Prevalence, correlates and attitudes towards sexting among young people in Melbourne, Australia | journal = Sexual Health | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 332–339 | doi = 10.1071/SH14032 | pmid = 25087581 | date = September 2014 | url = http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/164/paper/SH14032.htm | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many couples engage in sexting. In a 2011 study, 54% of the sample had sent explicit pictures or videos to their partners at least once, and ⅓ of their sample had engaged in such activities occasionally.&lt;ref name="Drouin 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Drouin | first1 = Michelle | last2 = Landgraff | first2 = Carly | author-link1 = Michelle Drouin | title = Texting, sexting, and attachment in college students' romantic relationships | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 444–449 | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2011.10.015 | date = March 2012 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas where [[gender role]]s traditionally expect men to initiate sexual encounters, sexting is used by women to offer nude images to male partners, allowing women greater latitude to instigate sex.&lt;ref name="visuality.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hasinoff | first = Amy Adele | title = Sexting as media production: rethinking social media and sexuality | journal = New Media &amp; Society | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 449–465 | doi = 10.1177/1461444812459171 | date = June 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visuality.org/genderedcyborgs/wmst320_readings/sexting_mediaproduction.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722213003/http://www.visuality.org/genderedcyborgs/wmst320_readings/sexting_mediaproduction.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Mass media does not encourage teen or underage sexting, because of the child pornography laws they could violate.&lt;ref name="visuality.org"/&gt;{{according to whom|date=November 2015}} However, a recent study found young women are significantly more likely than young men to be pressured into sending a nude photo, by their partner. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brook.org.uk/press-releases/digital-romance|title=Brook {{!}} Press releases {{!}} Digital Romance|website=www.brook.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, it was found that sexting is often used to enhance the relationship and sexual satisfaction in a romantic partnership. Sexting thus can be considered a "behaviour that ties into sexuality and the subsequent level of relationship satisfaction experienced by both partners". Based on the interviews conducted by Albury and Crawford, they discovered that sexting is commonly used in positive aspects. According to Albury and Crawford, sexting was not only an activity occurring in the context of flirtation or sexual relationships, but also between friends, as a joke or during a moment of bonding.”&lt;ref name="Parker 2013 1–12"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = Trent | last2 = Blackburn | first2 = Kristyn M. | last3 = Perry | first3 = Martha S. | last4 = Hawks | first4 = Jillian M. | title = Sexting as an intervention: relationship satisfaction and motivation considerations | journal = The American Journal of Family Therapy | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–12 | doi = 10.1080/01926187.2011.635134 | date = January 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, [[hedonism]] played a role in motivating sexting, and the length of relationship was negatively correlated with sexting behaviors. The study had a small sample size, so more research needs to be done surrounding sexting and motivation, but it is clear that sexting is a phenomenon that is not constrained to simply unattached individuals looking for fun; it is used by those in intimate relationships to increase feelings of intimacy and closeness one's partner.&lt;ref name="Parker 2013 1–12"/&gt; For teens, sexting can also act as a prelude (or in lieu of) sexual activity, as an experimental phase for those who are yet to be sexually active, and for those who are hoping to start a relationship with someone.&lt;ref name="Lenhart 2009"/&gt; In a 2013 study conducted by [[Michelle Drouin|Drouin]] et al., it was found that sexting is also associated with attachment styles, as those with [[Attachment theory|attachment avoidance]] are more likely to engage in sexting behaviours (just as these individuals are also more likely to engage in casual sex). Thus, instead of increasing intimacy in these types of relationships, sexting may act as a buffer for physical intimacy.&lt;ref name="Drouin 2011"/&gt;

In a 2008 survey of 1,280 teenagers and young adults of both sexes sponsored by ''The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy'', 20% of teens (13–20) and 33% of young adults (20–26) had sent nude or semi-nude photographs of themselves electronically.

A widely cited 2011 study indicated the previously reported prevalence was exaggerated. Researchers at the [[University of New Hampshire]] surveyed 1,560 children and caregivers, reporting that only 2.5 percent of respondents had sent, received or created sexual pictures distributed via cell phone in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Namuo|first=Clynton|title=UNH study finds 'sexting' not so prevalent|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20111205/NEWS04/712059957|work=[[Union Leader]] | location = New Hampshire| publisher = Joseph W. McQuaid|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps shedding light on the over-reporting of earlier studies, the researchers found that the figure rose to 9.6% when the definition was broadened from images prosecutable as child pornography to any suggestive image, not necessarily nude ones.&lt;ref name="WP2011"&gt;{{cite news |last=D'Arcy|first=Janice |title=Kids sexting less common than thought, study says  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-parenting/post/kids-sexting-less-common-than-thought-study-says/2011/11/30/gIQAzBPxLO_blog.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | publisher =[[Jeff Bezos|Nash Holdings LLC]] |date=5 December 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, a 2012 study conducted by the [[University of Utah]] Department of Psychology&lt;ref name="Strassberg 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strassberg | first1 = Donald | last2 = McKinnon | first2 =Ryan K. | title = Sexting by high school students: an exploratory and descriptive study | journal = [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-012-9969-8 | pmid = 22674035 | date = January 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120613132939.htm Abridged text.]&lt;/ref&gt; has received wide international media attention for calling into question the findings reported by the University of New Hampshire researchers. In the University of Utah's study, researchers Donald S. Strassberg, Ryan Kelly McKinnon, Michael A. Sustaíta, and Jordan Rullo surveyed 606 teenagers ages 14–18 and found that nearly 20 percent of the students said they had sent a sexually explicit image of themselves via cell phone, and nearly twice as many said that they had received a sexually explicit picture. Of those receiving such a picture, over 25 percent indicated that they had forwarded it to others. In addition, of those who had sent a sexually explicit picture, over a third had done so despite believing that there could be serious legal and other consequences if they got caught. Students who had sent a picture by cell phone were more likely than others to find the activity acceptable. Strassberg, McKinnon, ''et al''. note: "The news-worthiness of [the University of New Hampshire study] derives from [their] figure [2.5%] being far below (by a factor of 5 or more) the prevalence rates reported in the previous surveys. However, while technically accurate, the 2.5% figure is actually rather misleading. As seen in Table 1 of their publication, Mitchell et al. found that among the quarter of their sample that were ages 10–12, [less than] 0.6% 'appeared in, created, or received a nude or nearly nude image' while among those age 15–17, 15% of participants reported having done so. Despite it being widely reported in the media, the overall prevalence figure of 2.5% masks a dramatic age effect that indicates that more than 1 in 8 mid-teen minors admit to having sexted." Strassberg, McKinnon, et al. conclude: "These results argue for educational efforts such as cell phone safety assemblies, awareness days, integration into class curriculum and teacher training, designed to raise awareness about the potential consequences of sexting among young people."&lt;ref name="Strassberg 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maffly|first=Brian|title='Sexting' prevalent among high-schoolers, study finds|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/54324965-78/explicit-messages-nearly-onlinetoday.html.csp|work=[[Salt Lake Tribune]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Lois|title=As many as 20% of teens have 'sexted', according to new study|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765583658/As-many-as-20-of-teens-have-sexted.html?pg=all|work=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret News Publishing Company]]|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a writing by professor Diane Kholos Wysocki, although both men and women participate in "sexting", "women are more likely to sext than men".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/fashion/women-are-more-likely-to-sext-than-men-study-says-studied.html|title=Women Are More Likely to ‘Sext’ Than Men, Study Says: Studied|last=Paul|first=Pamela|date=15 July 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the article claims that women are more likely to sext than men, the article does not claim that women are the only ones receiving the images. In a study, close to half of the adults' interviewed had sexual photos or texts on their mobile device(s). Many of these intimate images and words are actually sent to complete strangers.  In an article in ''[[Scientific American]]'', however, the article says that men are actually more likely to initiate some form of intimate communication, like sending nude photographs or suggestive text messages. The reasoning behind this is that men seem to be more open about their sexual drive, which promotes the instigation of sexual contact. Also in this article, it says, "The age group that is most keen on sexting is 18 to 24- year olds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sext-much-if-so-youre-not-alone/|title=Sext much? If so, you're not alone|newspaper=Scientific American|access-date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is when young adults are at their prime of sexuality, and are looking to find their partners while also exploring their bodies and sexuality. Amy Adele Hasinoff published an article trying to get rid of the stigma that sexting is simply exploitation of sexual matters. Women are sexualized whenever they post or share any form of intimate media. Men are not. When it comes to sexting, there is a big difference between sexual exploitation and a consensual decision to express one's sexuality and share an image of their own body with someone who wants to see it. Hasinoff points out that “Many digital media scholars stress that the Internet can enable young people to explore their identities and develop social and communication skills (Boyd, 2008; Tynes, 2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasinoff|first=Amy Adele|date=1 June 2013|title=Sexting as media production: Rethinking social media and sexuality|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/15/4/449|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=449–465|doi=10.1177/1461444812459171|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt;” and suggests that consensual sexting might serve a similar function for some people.

The University of Utah study (with a population sample of 606 teens ages 14–18) stated that about one third of respondents did not consider legal or other consequences when receiving or sending sexts.&lt;ref name="Lohmann"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lohmann|first=Raychelle Cassada|title=The dangers of teen sexting (blog)|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/teen-angst/201207/the-dangers-teen-sexting|work=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|date=20 July 2012|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers may not be thinking about the risks and repercussions when they participate in sexting; however, a study by Kath Albury titled ''Selfies, Sexts, and Sneaky Hats: Young People's Understandings of Gendered Practices of Self-Presentation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/3132|title=Selfies- Selfies, Sexts and Sneaky Hats: Young People's Understandings of Gendered Practices of Self-Representation|first=Kath|last=Albury|date=15 May 2015|publisher=|volume=9|page=12|via=ijoc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that teenagers engaging in sexting were concerned that their parents may see or find out about their involvement with sexting. Some teenagers shared that their "main risks of parental discovery were embarrassment (for both parents and young people) and 'overreaction' from adults who feared the photo had been shared."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albury|first=Kath|date=2005|title=Selfies, Sexts, and Sneaky Hats: Young People's Understandings of Gendered Practices of Self-Representation|url=|journal=International Journal of Communication |volume=9|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While teenagers felt less compelled to worry about the legal risks with sexting, they worried that their parents would find out about their involvement with sexting. Albury and Crawford (2012) argue that adolescents are well aware of the differences between consensual sexting and distribution of private images with negative intent. Further, they argue young people are developing norms and ethics of sexting based on consent.

Creation and distribution of explicit photos of teenagers violates [[child pornography]] laws in many jurisdictions (depending on the age of the people depicted), but this legal restriction does not align with the social norms of the population engaging in the practice, which distinguish between consensual activity and harassment or revenge.&lt;ref name="visuality.org" /&gt; Senders in some jurisdictions may also be charged with distribution of indecent material to a minor, and could be required to register as a [[sex offender]] for life.

While mainstream media outlets, parents, and educators are rightfully worried about the negative legal, social, and emotional ramifications of teen sexting, much less is said about the issue of [[sexual consent]]. According to a 2012 study conducted by professors at the University of New South Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexting, consent and young people's ethics: Beyond Megan's Story|first1=Kath|last1=Albury|first2=Kate|last2=Crawford|date=1 June 2012|volume=26|issue=3|pages=463–473|doi=10.1080/10304312.2012.665840|journal=Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to child pornography laws that prohibit any minor from consenting to sexual activity, issues of consent among adolescent teens is seldom discussed. Much like the discourse surrounding [[abstinence-only education|"abstinence-only" education]], the prevailing attitude towards sexting is how to prevent it from occurring rather than accepting its inevitability and channeling it in healthier ways. According to the study, instead of criminalizing teens who participate in sexting, the law should account for whether the images are shared consensually. This would mean adopting an "ethics" approach, one that teaches and guides teens on how to respect bodily autonomy and privacy.

According to a study done by the health journal ''Pediatrics'', more than one in five middle school children with behavioral or emotional problems has recently engaged in sexting. Those individuals who have reported sexting in the past six months were four to seven times more likely to engage in other sexual activities such as intimate kissing, touching genitals, and having vaginal or [[oral sex]], compared to children who stated they did not partake in sexting. The study included 420 participants who were between the ages of 12 and 14 years old. The children were pulled from five urban public middle schools in [[Rhode Island]] between 2009 and 2012. Seventeen percent of the children tested claimed they had sent a sexually explicit text message in the past six months. Another five percent admitted to sending sexually explicit text messages and nude or semi-nude photos.&lt;ref name="sexting linked to sex"&gt;{{cite news|last=Seaman|first=Andrew|title=Sexting common, linked to sex among high-risk youth|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/sexting-common-linked-sex-among-high-risk-youth-123824395.html|accessdate=6 January 2014|website=ca.news.yahoo.com|agency=Reuters |date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pediatircs&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rice | first1 = Eric | last2 = Rhoades | first2 = Harmony | last3 = Winetrobe | first3 = Hailey | last4 = Sanchez | first4 = Monica | last5 = Montoya | first5 = Jorge | last6 = Plant | first6 = Aaron | last7 = Kordic | first7 = Timothy | title = Sexually explicit cell phone messaging associated with sexual risk among adolescents | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 130 | issue = 4 | pages = 667–673 | pmid = 22987882 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2012-0021 | date = October 2012 | ref = harv | pmc=3457617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
Sexting is generally legal if all parties are over the [[age of majority]] and images are sent with their consent and knowledge; however, any type of sexual message that both parties have not consented to can constitute [[sexual harassment]].

Sexting that involves [[Minor (law)|minors]] under the [[age of consent]] sending an explicit photograph of themselves to a romantic partner of the same age can be illegal in countries where anti-[[child pornography]] laws require all participants in pornographic media to be over the age of majority. Some teenagers who have texted photographs of themselves, or of their friends or partners, have been charged with distribution of child pornography, while those who have received the images have been charged with possession of child pornography; in some cases, the possession charge has been applied to school administrators who have investigated sexting incidents as well. The images involved in sexting are usually different in both nature and motivation from the type of content that anti-child pornography laws were created to address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Clark-Flory | first = Tracy | title = The new pornographers | url = http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2009/02/20/sexting_teens | website = [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]] | publisher = [[Salon (website)|Salon Media Group]] | date = 20 February 2009 | access-date = 6 February 2016 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110902123953/http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2009/02/20/sexting_teens | archivedate = 2 September 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmitz | first1 = Sandra | last2 = Siry | first2 = Lawrence | title = Teenage folly or child abuse?

A 2009 UK survey of 2,094 teens aged 11 to 18 found that 38% had received an "offensive or distressing" sexual image by text or email.&lt;ref name="Beatbully_survey"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer |title = Truth of sexting amongst UK teens|website = Beatbullying.org | publisher =  |date = 4 August 2009|url = http://www.beatbullying.org/docs/media-centre/news-archive/August%2009/truth_of_sexting.html|accessdate = 20 October 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090808091855/http://www.beatbullying.org/docs/media-centre/news-archive/August%2009/truth_of_sexting.html|archivedate = 8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, anyone who is involved in the electronic distribution of sexual photos of minors can face state and federal charges of child pornography. The laws disregard the consent of parties involved."...regardless
of one’s age or consent to sexting, it is unlawful to produce, possess, or distribute explicit sexual images of anyone under 18."&lt;ref name="visuality.org"/&gt;  The University of New Hampshire’s Crimes Against Children Research Center estimates that 7 percent of people arrested on suspicion of child pornography production in 2009 were teenagers who shared images with peers consensually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolak|first1=Janis|last2=Finkelhor|first2=David|last3=Mitchel|first3=Kimberly J.|title=Trends in Arrests for Child Pornography Production: The Third National Juvenile Online Victimization Study (NJOV‐3)|url=http://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1046&amp;context=ccrc|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kath Albury discusses in an article titled "Sexting, Consent, and Young People's Ethics: Beyond Megan's Story" that if teens are convicted of a sexting charge, they have to register as a sex offender, and this takes away the impact of the title of sex offender. A girl who agreed to send her girlfriend a naked picture is not as dangerous to the community as a child molester but the charge of sex offender would be applied equally to both of these cases.&lt;ref&gt;[Kath Albury &amp; Kate Crawford (2012): Sexting, consent and young people's
ethics: Beyond Megan's Story , Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies, 26:3, 463-473], more text.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 interview, assistant professor of communications at the University of Colorado Denver, Amy Adele Hasinoff, who studies the repercussions of sexting has stated that the "very harsh" child pornography laws are "designed to address adults exploiting children" and should not replace better sex education and consent training for teens. She went on to say, "Sexting is a sex act, and if it's consensual, that’s fine..." "Anyone who distributes these pictures without consent is doing something malicious and abusive, but child pornography laws are too harsh to address it."&lt;ref name=2013CaNPSelfiePorn&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Karen|title=Child pornography laws 'too harsh' to deal with minors sexting photos without consent, experts say|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/11/16/child-pornography-laws-too-harsh-to-deal-with-minors-sexting-photos-without-consent-experts-say/|work=National Post News | location= Canada| date = 16 November 2013|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Amy Hasinoff, if sexting was viewed as media production and a consensual activity, this would change the legal assumption that sexting is always non-consensual and reduce the culpability of victimized youth. This turns sexting into a situation that would lead to different legal consequences when distribution of the material was not consented to by the creator.&lt;ref name="visuality.org" /&gt;  Alvin J. Primack, who draws from Amy Hasinoff's work, argued a media production model may be useful for distinguishing between child pornography and sexting from a First Amendment perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Primack|first=Alvin J.|date=2017|title=Youth sexting and the First Amendment: Rhetoric and child pornography doctrine in the age of translation|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=20|issue=8|pages=2917–2933|doi=10.1177/1461444817737297}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alvin J. Primack,  the motivation for creating and distributing sexts (e.g., pleasure, relationship building) differs from the motivation for creating and distributing child pornography (e.g., abuse, exploitation), and the market of circulation is generally different between the two as well. For these reasons, there may be arguments - grounded in reasoning provided by First Amendment doctrine - for finding some youth sexts exchanged between persons who are of the age of consent to be legally-protected speech. 

Legal professionals and academics have expressed that the use of "child porn laws" with regard to sexting is "extreme" or "too harsh". Florida cyber crimes defense attorney David S. Seltzer wrote of this that "I do not believe that our child pornography laws were designed for these situations&amp;nbsp;... A conviction for possession of child pornography in Florida draws up to five years in prison for each picture or video, plus a lifelong requirement to [[Sex offender registries in the United States|register as a sex offender]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Seltzer | first = David S. | title = Miami criminal defense lawyer | url = http://www.cybercrimelawyerblog.com/2008/12/miami_criminal_defense_lawyer_1.html | website = cybercrimelawyerblog.com | publisher = Seltzer Law, Pennsylvania | date = 19 December 2008 | access-date = 6 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics have argued that ''sexting'' is a broad term for images being sent over Internet and cell phones, between minors, adults, or minors and adults, and in an abusive manner or in an innocent manner. In order to develop policy better suited for adolescent sexting cases, it is necessary to have better terms and categories of sexting. University of New Hampshire [[Typology (linguistics)|typology]] has suggested the term ''youth-produced sexual image'' to classify adolescent sexting. Furthermore, they branch into two sub-categories: ''aggravated'' and ''experimental youth-produced sexual image''. Aggravated cases include cases of sexual assault, coercion, cyber-bullying, forwarding images without consent, and abusive behavior. Experimental cases are cases in which an adolescent willingly takes a picture and sends it to someone with no criminal intent and is attention-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Judge | first1 = Abigail | year = 2012 | title = "Sexting" Among U.S. Adolescents: Psychological and Legal Perspectives | url = http://abigailjudge.com/img/amj-hrp-2012.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Harvard Review of Psychiatry | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology could lead to more appropriate action towards adolescents who engage in sexting.

===Legal cases===
* In 2007, 32 Australian teenagers from the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] were prosecuted as a result of sexting activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=Liz|title=Malice in wonderland |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/malice-in-wonderland/2008/08/09/1218139163632.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |date=10 August 2008 |accessdate=14 January 2009 |work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, an assistant principal in the US state of [[Virginia]] was charged with possession of [[child pornography]] and related crimes after he had been asked to investigate a rumored sexting incident at the high school where he worked. Upon finding a student in possession of a photo on his phone that depicted the torso of a girl wearing only underpants, her arms mostly covering her breasts, the assistant principal showed the image to the principal, who instructed him to preserve it on his computer as evidence, which he did. The court later ruled that the photo did not constitute child pornography because under Virginia law, nudity alone is not enough to qualify an image as child pornography; the image must be "sexually explicit". [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]] prosecutor James Plowman stood by his initial assessment of the photo and says he would not have pursued the case if the assistant principal had agreed to resign. Instead, the assistant principal took out a second mortgage on his house and spent $150,000 in attorneys' fees to clear his name.&lt;ref name=Zetter&gt;{{cite news | last = Zetter | first = Kim | title = 'Sexting' hysteria falsely brands educator as child pornographer | url = http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2009/04/sexting-hysteri.html | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | publisher = [[Condé Nast]] | date = 3 April 2009 | access-date = 6 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Oei | first = Ting-Yi | title = My students.

===Legislative responses===
In Connecticut, Rep. [[Rosa Rebimbas]] introduced a bill that would lessen the penalty for "sexting" between two consenting minors in 2009.
The bill would make it a Class A misdemeanor for children under 18 to send or receive text messages with other minors that include nude or sexual images. It is currently a felony for children to send such messages, and violators could end up on the state's sex offender registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Falcone|first=Amanda|title=Rookie legislator in national eye with bill To lessen 'sexting' penalty for consenting minors|url=http://articles.courant.com/2010-04-05/news/hc-ct-rosa-rebimbas-0402.artapr05_1_rep-rosa-rebimbas-sexting-minors|work=Hartford Courant|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=5 April 2010|access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermont lawmakers introduced a bill in April 2009 to legalize the consensual exchange of graphic images between two people 13 to 18 years old. Passing along such images to others would remain a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Associated Press|author-link=Associated Press|title=Vermont considers legalizing teen 'sexting'| url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,514875,00.html| work = Fox News Channel| date = 13 April 2009|access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ohio, a county prosecutor and two lawmakers proposed a law that would reduce sexting from a [[felony]] to a first degree [[misdemeanor]], and eliminate the possibility of a teenage offender being labeled a sex offender for years. The proposal was supported by the parents of Jesse Logan, a Cincinnati 18-year-old who committed suicide after the naked picture of herself which she sexted was forwarded to people in her high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Russ|first=Dick| title = Ohio to address 'sexting' laws| url = http://www.wkyc.com/print.aspx?storyid=111478| work = [[WKYC|WKYC-TV]]|publisher =[[Tegna, Inc.]] | location = Cleveland, Ohio | date = 13 April 2009|access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York, Assemblyman Ken Zebrowski (D-Rockland) has introduced a bill that will create an [[affirmative defense]] where a minor is charged under child pornography laws if they possesses or disseminate a picture of themselves or possess or disseminates the image of another minor (within 4 years of their age) with their consent. The affirmative defense will not be available if the conduct was done without consent. It also creates an educational outreach program for teens that promotes awareness about the dangers of sexting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Galef |first=Sandy | author-link = Sandy Galef |title=Bill no: A08622 summary|url=http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&amp;bn=A08622&amp;term=2015&amp;Summary=Y&amp;Actions=Y&amp;Text=Y&amp;Votes=Y |date= 16 December 2015 |website=assembly.state.ny.us |publisher=[[New York State Assembly]] |access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australian state of Victoria, the law was reformed in 2014 to create a defence for young people who engage in consensual sexting and the introduction of the new offences of distribution of an intimate image, and threat to distribute an intimate image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cla.asn.au/News/victoria-passes-sexting-laws/|title=Victoria passes 'sexting' laws...|date=16 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tort law}}
A '''slip and fall''' injury, also known as a '''trip and fall''', is a [[premises liability]] claim, a type of [[personal injury]] claim or case based on a person slipping (or tripping) on the premises of another and, as a result, suffering injury.  It is a [[tort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapo|first1=Marshall|title=Principles of Tort Law|date=3 March 2016|publisher=West Group|isbn=0314285628|page=1-01|edition=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnGhCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who is injured by falling may be entitled to monetary [[Damages|compensation]] for the injury from the owner or person in possession of the premises where the injury occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Slip and Fall Accident Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal-injury-and-torts/slip-and-fall-accident-law|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liability for slip or trip and fall injuries may arise based upon a [[defendant]]'s ownership of the premises where the injury occurred, their control of the premises, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weissenberger|first1=Glen|last2=McFarland|first2=Barbara|title=The Law of Premises Liablity|date=February 2017|publisher=LexisNexis|isbn=9781593458027|edition=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLynZAi91SkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a store may be liable for a slip-and-fall injury that occurs inside of its premises, even though it rents those premises, because it has exclusive control of the interior of the rented property. The owner of the premises (the store's [[landlord]]) may have sole or shared liability for an injury that occurs outside of the store's exclusive premises, such as the injury from a fall on the sidewalk or in the parking lot of a shopping mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Love|first1=Jean C.|title=Landlord's Liability for Defective Premises: Caveat Lessee, Negligence, or Strict Liability|journal=Wisconsin Law Review|volume=1975|issue=1|pages=19-160|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1228&amp;context=facpubs|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Property owners have two basic defenses to slip and fall claims:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negligence|url=http://webpage.pace.edu/pacelegalassistance/negligence.htm|website=Guide to Common Legal Questions|publisher=Pace University|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Lack of negligence''': The defendant may argue that they were not negligent in creating the condition that caused a person to trip or slip, or were not negligent in correcting the condition before injury occurred. For example, the owner of a grocery store may claim that the banana that a patron slipped upon had been dropped on the floor only moments ago by another patron, and that, in the exercise of [[due diligence]], a typical store owner acting with reasonable care would not have had time to discover the danger and take steps to mitigate the danger.

*'''Lack of fault''': The defendant may claim that the injured person was responsible for his or her own injury. For example, the owner may claim that any reasonable patron, exercising due diligence for his or her own safety, would see a banana on the floor, and take those steps necessary to avoid slipping on it.

'''Soil cement''' is a [[construction material]], a mix of pulverized natural [[soil]] with small amount of [[portland cement]] and [[water]], usually processed in a tumble, compacted to high density. Hard, semi-rigid durable material is formed by [[Hydration reaction|hydration]] of the cement particles.

Soil cement is frequently used as a construction material for pipe bedding, slope protection, and road construction as a [[subbase]] layer reinforcing and protecting the [[subgrade]]. It has good [[compressive strength|compressive]] and [[shear strength]], but is [[brittle]] and has low [[tensile strength]], so it is prone to forming cracks.

Soil cement mixtures differs from Portland cement concrete in the amount of paste ([[cement]]-water mixture). While in Portland cement concretes the paste coats all aggregate particles and binds them together, in soil cements the amount of cement is lower and therefore there are voids left, and the result is a cement matrix with [[nodule (geology)|nodule]]s of uncemented material.

Invented by Benjamin Harrison Flynn to pave roads in Louisiana after WW1.

==Types of soil cement==

===Cement-modified soils (CMS)===
A '''cement-modified soil''' contains relatively small proportion of Portland cement, less than in ordinary soil-cement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cement.org/think-harder-concrete-/paving/cement-modified-soils-(cms) "Cement-Modified Soil (CMS)" Portland Cement Association accessed March, 16 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The result is caked or slightly hardened material, similar to a soil, but with improved mechanical properties such as lower [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], increased bearing ratio and shear strength, and decreased volume change. The purpose of modifying soil with Portland cement is to improve a substandard soil's engineering qualities.

===Soil-cement base (SCB)===
A '''soil-cement base''' contains higher proportion of cement than cement-modified soil. It is commonly used as a cheap [[Pavement (material)|pavement]] base for roads, streets, parking lots, airports, and material handling areas. Specialized equipment, such as a soil stabilizer and a [[Stoltzfus Spreaders|mechanical cement spreader]] is usually required. A seal coat is required in order to keep [[moisture]] out. For uses as a [[road]] construction material, a suitable surface coating, usually a thin layer of [[asphalt concrete]], is needed to reduce [[wear]].

In comparison with granular bases, soil cement bases can be thinner for the same road load, owing to their slab-like behavior that distributes load over broader areas. In-place or nearby located materials can be used for construction - locally found soil, stone, or reclaimed granular base from a road being reconstructed. This conserves both material and energy.

The strength of soil-cement bases actually increases with age, providing good long-term performance.

===Cement-treated base (CTB)===
A '''cement-treated base''' is a mix of granular soil aggregates or aggregate material with Portland cement and water. It is similar in use and performance to soil-cement base. &lt;!-- What's the difference? --&gt;

===Acrylic copolymer (Rhino Snot)===
Developed for the U.S. Military in desert conditions and commercially trademarked, "Rhino Snot" is a water-soluble acrylic copolymer applied to soil or sand which penetrates and coats the surface. When dry, it forms a waterproof, UV-resistant, solid bond which binds the soil together, reducing dust. In higher concentration it creates a durable surface that can withstand heavy traffic, allowing existing soil to be used for roads, parking lots, trails and other heavy traffic areas.

Teacher [[tenure]] is a policy that restricts the ability to fire teachers, requiring a "[[just cause]]" rationale for firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.com/magazine/article/what-is-teacher-tenure/ |title=What Is Teacher Tenure? |publisher=Education.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The individual states each have established their own tenure systems.&lt;ref name="mrhorn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mrhorn.com/wp/posts/new-jersey-teacher-tenure/ |title=New Jersey Teacher Tenure |first=Brandon |last=Horn |publisher=Mrhorn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenure provides teachers with protections by making it difficult to fire teachers who earn tenure. Many states are focusing on tenure reform. Revisions would be made so that the tenure system no longer functions the same way as the existing tenure system functions.&lt;ref name="americanprogress1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/02/pdf/teacher_tenure.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524052828/http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/02/pdf/teacher_tenure.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Tenure has been a controversial issue for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED073114&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED073114 |title=Tenure Under Attack: Myth and Fact in the Tenure Debate |publisher=Education Resources Information Center |date= |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lately reforming or eliminating teacher tenure has become a pressing issue covered vastly by the media.  Many politicians are actively voicing their opinions on tenure.  Many states have new plans for their tenure system.  There are many different reforms which are trying to be passed by legislation.  It is hard to get reforms passed because one side of the debate must give up something every time a proposal is made.  Some argue{{who|date=March 2016}} tenure is no longer necessary and that it is hurting America's education system.  Others argue tenure provides vital protections for teachers.
While each state has its own specifics for how teacher tenure works, most hold a similar form.  Each new teacher is given a probation period (probation periods vary among states).  During this probation period, teachers must prove they are worthy of receiving tenure.  They must prove that they are having a positive effect on their students using a teacher evaluation system, which includes information from several facets of a teacher's responsibilities. Some common facets are classroom observations, student growth, and self-reflection (see, for example, New Haven &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhps.net/node/2328&lt;/ref&gt; and the state of Virginia &lt;ref&gt;http://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching/performance_evaluation/teacher/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;).

Take a look at New Jersey's tenure system as an example.  Currently under New Jersey's tenure system, a teacher is placed on probation for three years during which time the teacher is evaluated using a system called AchieveNJ.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.nj.us/education/AchieveNJ/teacher/&lt;/ref&gt;  During or after these three years, the principal must decide if the school will grant tenure to this teacher.  If so, the teacher will be asked to work there for a fourth year and will be granted tenure.  The principal is able to fire a teacher at any time during the probation period.  However, once a teacher is tenured, the principal can no longer fire a teacher without just cause.  The teacher is then protected by tenure.  There are four reasons a teacher may be fired in New Jersey once they are tenured.  The reasons include: incapacity, inefficiency, unbecoming conduct and just cause.  A teacher being fired for any of these reasons is given a chance to defend their case.&lt;ref name="mrhorn1"/&gt;

==History==
[[Tenure]] was created to provide teachers with protections. The exact beginning point of tenure is debatable.  Many do not fully agree why or when tenure was created.  From the very beginning, tenure was controversial.  Some say the fight for these protections started around the 1920s. Women dominated the teaching profession at this time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/nr/re/hd/yr1999hd05.asp |title=AAV of Tracing the Roots of Teacher Tenure |publisher=California Department of Education |date= |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massachusetts was the first state to introduce teacher tenure back in 1886, as the early beginnings of the progressive movement swept across the country. http://teachertenure.procon.org/ 
A long time ago, teachers were subject to rules which impeded on basic rights.  For example, teachers were told what time they should be home, which activities they should engage in, who they could associate with, etc.  Teachers were often fired for breaking these rules.  Teachers came together to gain protections against such rules.  They wanted their own rules which ensured they wouldn't be fired without reason.  Teacher unions were not yet formed.  They were in the process of being formed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Others argue that tenure was started to protect professors from losing academic freedom.  Wealthy industrialists started writing and undermining professors.  Tenure was created to ensure professors would be able to write freely.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~reupfom/tenure.html&lt;/ref&gt; It angers many people that the reason why tenure was developed is not clear.  There is no one event or exact time when tenure was created.  Many argue there is no reason to keep a tenure system that had no real foundation for being started.

==The debate==

===Pro tenure reform===
Many states are looking into reforming and even eliminating their teacher tenure system.  Some of the states leading the movement include [[Florida]], [[New Jersey]], [[Idaho]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rotherham |first=Andrew J. |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2044529,00.html |title=Teacher Tenure Debate: How to Modify Due-Process Rules |publisher=Time |date=2011-01-27 |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many{{who|date=July 2018}} argue that by granting teachers tenure, the education system is flooded with teachers who are no longer effective.  Some argue{{who|date=March 2016}} that tenure grants teachers permanent positions regardless of whether or not they deserve a job.  Many say because our education system is flooded with these ineffective teachers, students are suffering.{{how|date=July 2018}}  Those who are pro reforming/eliminating tenure say having bad teachers in the education system is shortchanging too many children in American schools.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Supporters of reforming/eliminating tenure feel that tenure does nothing but protect ''"bad"'' teachers and hurt students. They believe that tenure is given out too readily in America. Teachers should receive tenure based on their effectiveness rather than how long they have been teaching. Many feel that the process to fire a teacher takes too much time and money.  This side of the debate feels it should be easier to fire tenured teachers.  Many would also like to see teachers being evaluated based on their performance and their students' academic achievement.&lt;ref name="americanprogress1"/&gt;  In eight states in America, tenure is given to teachers after just two years of teaching during the probation period.  In two states, tenure is awarded after only one year of teaching during the probation period.  Washington DC does not require a  set time for awarding tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-merrow/teacher-tenure-debate_b_800732.html |first=John |last=Merrow |title=It's Time to Debate Teacher Tenure |publisher=Huffington Post |date= 2011-02-23|accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of this motion feel that one or two years is too short a time to tell if a teacher is having a positive effect on their students.  Before these teachers are granted lifetime job protection, they would like to see them perform on probation for a longer period of time.  Reforms have been created in all forms.  Some reforms call for longer probation periods while others call for stricter teacher evaluations.  Other reforms wish to rid the tenure system completely and replace this system with renewable contracts.&lt;ref name="americanprogress1"/&gt;

====Key actors====
New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]] is working hard to reform the tenure system in New Jersey.  He does not want to eliminate the tenure system completely.  He wants to eliminate the current tenure system and replace it with a new one.&lt;ref name="njspotlight1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mooney |first=John |url=http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/11/0414/0029/ |title=Gov. Christie Offers First Peek at Education Reform Bills |publisher=NJ Spotlight |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently in New Jersey, after a teacher proves themselves efficient for 3 years, they gain lifetime protection under tenure.&lt;ref name="mrhorn1"/&gt; Christie wants to change the tenure system.  He wants teachers to prove themselves for three years to gain tenure.  However, after one year of being deemed "ineffective", teachers will easily be fired. Christie wants to judge whether a teacher is ineffective or not on a two part assessment.  One part of the score will be based on student achievement.  The second part of the score will be based on teacher performance.&lt;ref name="njspotlight1"/&gt; Christie believes the answer to making schools more effective is to place more accountability on teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mooney |first=John |url=http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/11/0209/2210/ |title=Union City Schools: A Test Case for Christie Reforms? |publisher=NJ Spotlight |date=2011-02-10 |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie stated, ''"Let New Jersey lead the way again,"'', ''"The time to eliminate teacher tenure is now."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galioto |first=Catherine |url=http://pointpleasant.patch.com/articles/christie-calls-for-terminating-teacher-tenure-and-cutting-spending |title=Christie Calls for Eliminating Teacher Tenure and Cutting Spending |publisher=Patch.com |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former chancellor of DC public schools, [[Michelle Rhee]], had made plans to eliminate teacher tenure altogether.  Rhee designed a pay plan which would compensate teachers by giving them big pay raises in exchange for their tenure protection rights.  She gave existing tenured teachers the ''choice'' to accept this proposal.  New hires would be ''forced'' to accept this new pay plan.  New hires would be paid on the basis of their students' achievement.  While teachers would prospectively be able to make more money under this pay plan, they would not be granted any tenure protections.  Rhee's plan was unsuccessful.  Teachers did not want to give up their tenure protections for a higher salary.  After this plan failed she continued to devise plans.  She offered a buyout plan for existing teachers with tenure.  In 2009, she created a plan called IMPACT.  This plan tied students performance on state tests to teachers evaluation.  While this plan gained the support of many, there were still many others who opposed it.&lt;ref name="americanprogress1"/&gt;

===Against tenure reform===
Supporters of tenure argue that tenure is necessary in making education systems successful.  Tenure protects teachers and allows them to participate in unfavorable activities.  For example, teachers are able to fail poorly performing students regardless of how influential they are to the school. Supporters also assert it protects teachers' [[freedom of speech]]. Freedom of speech is especially important when teachers write articles on issues which their administrators may not be in favor of. Those in favor of keeping tenure also argue that teachers are fired easily when they commit serious crimes or are ineffective.  Supporters of the tenure system say tenure is not keeping teachers who would commit such crimes in the system.  In some states, schools are required to pay more to teachers who have earned higher degrees, and tenure allows teachers to secure a job, go back to school, and return to their jobs, not fearing dismissal because of their higher pay grade. Supporters liken tenure to the concept of seniority in other jobs.  Teachers are often forced into uncomfortable situations (such as failing students, choosing certain students).  An employee who makes decisions of a difficult and confrontational nature would thus require job protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachers.net/gazette/JAN02/brekke.html |title=Why Teachers Need Tenure |author=Stewart E Brekke |publisher=Teachers.Net |year=2001 |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many who are against the motion of reforming/eliminating tenure argue that tenure allows teaching to become a profession rather than just a job. Presumably, teachers would not have as much job stability and would be forced to transfer from school to school. Giving teachers permanent positions would allow them to form bonds and relationships with students, parents, and other faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20110407/NEWS/110409625?p=2&amp;tc=pg |author=Matt Coleman |title=Why teachers need tenure |publisher=Gainesville.com |date=2011-04-07 |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent reform actions taken==
Many states have recently made reforms to their tenure system.  Some of these states include:
*'''[[California]]''' was the first state to adopt a tenure system.  They have made many attempts to reform their system.  One of the more recent attempts was made by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in January 2005.  He tried to pass an act (Excellence in Teaching Act) which would pay teachers on the basis of their performance.  He also wanted to enact the "Put the Kids First Act" which would extend the probation period of teachers to five years (it is currently two years).  This act would also allow a school to fire teachers after two unsatisfactory ratings.  The school would no longer have to give the teacher 90 days to improve their performance before being fired.  This stirred up much controversy among the teachers in California.  The act was voted on and was never passed.&lt;ref name="americanprogress1"/&gt;
*'''[[Florida]]'''- In 1997 a major movement toward reforming tenure took place.  This reform is considered a success.  This tenure reform reduced the probationary period a teacher worked to achieve tenure to 97 days instead of a year.  During those 97 days, a teacher could be fired without just cause.  The results of this tenure reform do not seem to be making any major improvements in Florida's tenure system.  Only 101 of Florida's 10,689 new teachers were dismissed by the school in 1998.  While this reform is considered a success, teacher unions stepped in and won back many protections.  In 2009, a new plan was proposed.  Legislators wished to get rid of tenure for all new teachers.  Tenure would be replaced with yearly renewable contracts.  After ten years, a teacher would be eligible for renewable contracts which would last up to five years.  This plan was never passed by the Senate.&lt;ref name="americanprogress1"/&gt;
*'''[[New York (state)|New York]]'''-  In 2007, Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] voiced his concern that although teachers could be let go easily during the three year probation period, they hardly were.  In 2008, Bloomberg introduced the Principal Portal.  This was a tool that principals would use to help evaluate their teachers.  It gave them guidelines to follow and base their decisions on.  The Principal Portal was successful.  The number of teachers let go during their probation period doubled in the first year.  Bloomberg also wished to have students test scores incorporated in the tenure process.

'''''The Medina''''' (1876) 2 PD 5 is an [[English contract law]] case, regarding the voidability of an agreement and a restitutionary award where the court finds that agreement is procured under extortionate circumstances.

==Facts==
On a voyage from [[Singapore]] to [[Jeddah]], ''The Medina'' hit [[Parkin Rock]], part of the [[Hanish Islands]] in the [[Red Sea]], and was wrecked. It had 550 [[pilgrims]] on board, who were taken by lifeboats to the rocks. ''The Timor'' answered a distress signal but refused to take the refugees to Jedda unless the master of ''The Medina'' paid £4000. The master agreed. But when they were safe, the master refused to pay. The captain of ''The Timor'' claimed the money in court.

==Judgment==
The Court of Appeal held that the £4000 was excessive, and so only £1800 would be awarded.

James LJ said it was ‘a very exorbitant sum for only a few days’ work… having regard to the particular circumstances, that pressure was exercised’.

Baggallay JA said it was ‘very large in comparison with the services rendered’ leading ‘to the conclusion that there may have been some unfair dealing’. The ‘captain of the Medina was bound to accept any terms which were pressed upon him by the Timor.

Brett JA said the standard rule is that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;where there is an agreement made by competent persons and there is no misrepresentation of facts, the agreement ought to be upheld, unless there is something very strong to shew that it is inequitable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Promising to pay when there are 550 stranded people was "compulsion to the mind of any honest man".

{{Intellectual property}}
A '''trade secret''' is a [[formula]], [[best practice|practice]], [[business process|process]], [[design]], [[legal instrument|instrument]], [[pattern]], commercial method, or compilation of [[information]] not generally known or reasonably ascertainable by others by which a [[business]] can obtain an economic advantage over competitors or customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2047462|title=Executive Trade Secrets|first=Tom C. W.|last=Lin|date=28 April 2012|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[jurisdiction]]s, such secrets are referred to as ''[[confidential information]]''.

==Definition==

The precise language by which a trade secret is defined varies by jurisdiction, as do the particular types of information that are subject to trade secret protection. Three factors are common to all such definitions: 

A trade secret is information that

* is not generally known to the public;
* confers economic benefit on its holder ''because'' the information is not publicly known; and
* is the subject of reasonable efforts by the holder to maintain its secrecy.

In international law, these three factors define a trade secret under article 39 of the [[TRIPS Agreement|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]], commonly referred to as the TRIPS Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04d_e.htm#7
|title=Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Section 7: Protection of Undisclosed Information
|publisher=[[World Trade Organization]]|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the United States [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]], "A trade secret, as defined under {{UnitedStatesCode|18|1839}}(3)(A),(B) (1996), has three parts: (1) information; (2) reasonable measures taken to protect the information; and (3) which derives independent economic value from not being publicly known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Value==
Trade secrets are an important, but invisible component of a company's [[intellectual property]] (IP). Their contribution to a company's value, measured as its [[market capitalization]], can be major.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Merges, Peter S. Menell, Mark A. Lemley (@006)  Intellectual Property in the Technological Age, 3rd ed.; Aspen&lt;/ref&gt; Being invisible, that contribution is hard to measure.&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Lev (2001): Intangibles, Management, Measurement and Reporting, with comments by conference participants; Brookings Institution Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Patents are a visible contribution, but delayed, and unsuitable for internal [[innovation]]s. Having an internal [[Dashboard (management information systems)|scoreboard]] provides insight into the cost of risks of employees leaving to serve or start competing ventures.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Protection==
In contrast to registered intellectual property, trade secrets are, by definition, not disclosed to the world at large. Instead, owners of trade secrets seek to protect trade secret information from competitors by instituting special procedures for handling it, as well as technological and legal security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Elbaum | first = Dan | year = 2011 | title = Human factors in information-age trade secret protection | url = http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/chrr/22 | journal = Cornell HR Review | accessdate = 2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal protections include [[non-disclosure agreement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (NDAs), and [[work-for-hire]] and [[non-compete clause]]s. In other words, in exchange for an opportunity to be employed by the holder of secrets, an employee may sign agreements to not reveal their prospective employer's proprietary information, to surrender or assign to their employer ownership rights to intellectual work and work-products produced during the course (or as a condition) of employment, and to not work for a competitor for a given period of time (sometimes within a given geographic region). Violation of the agreement generally carries the possibility of heavy financial penalties which operate as a disincentive to reveal trade secrets. However, proving a breach of an NDA by a former stakeholder  who is legally working for a competitor or prevailing in a lawsuit for breaching a non-compete clause can be very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Customer Lists as Trade Secrets |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/customer-lists-trade-secrets|publisher=[[Dykema Gossett]] PLLC|work=The National Law Review|date=2009-12-30|accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A holder of a trade secret may also require similar agreements from other parties he or she deals with, such as vendors, licensees, and board members.

As a company can protect its confidential information through NDA, work-for-hire, and non-compete contracts with its stakeholders (within the constraints of employment law, including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic- and time-scope), these protective contractual measures effectively create a perpetual monopoly on secret information that does not expire as would a [[patent]] or [[copyright]]. The lack of formal protection associated with registered intellectual property rights, however, means that a third party not bound by a signed agreement is not prevented from independently duplicating and using the secret information once it is discovered, such as through [[reverse engineering]].
[[File:Chartreuse-bottle.jpg|180px|thumb|Green [[Chartreuse liqueur]] protected by confidential information of the ingredients]]
Therefore, trade secrets such as secret formulae are often protected by restricting the key information to a few trusted individuals. Famous examples of products protected by trade secrets are [[Chartreuse liqueur]] and [[Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref&gt;Leon Stafford for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution December 8, 2011 [http://www.ajc.com/news/business/coke-hides-its-secret-formula-in-plain-sight-in-wo/nQPMm/ Coke hides its secret formula in plain sight in World of Coca-Cola move]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because protection of trade secrets can, in principle, extend indefinitely, it therefore may provide an advantage over patent protection and other registered intellectual property rights, which last only for a specific duration. The Coca-Cola company, for example, has no patent for the [[Coca-Cola formula|formula of Coca-Cola]] and has been effective in protecting it for many more years than the 20 years of protection that a patent would have provided. In fact, Coca-Cola refused to reveal its trade secret under at least two judges' orders.&lt;ref&gt;''For God, Country &amp; Coca-Cola'', by [[Mark Pendergrast]], 2nd Ed., Basic Books 2000, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies often try to discover one another's trade secrets through lawful methods of [[reverse engineering]] or employee poaching on one hand, and potentially unlawful methods including [[industrial espionage]] on the other. Acts of industrial espionage are generally illegal in their own right under the relevant governing laws, and penalties can be harsh.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Fox Rubin (2012): Former Dow Chemical Scientist Gets Five Year in Prison; Wall Street Journal, 13 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of that illegality to trade secret law is: if a trade secret is acquired by improper means (a somewhat wider concept than "illegal means" but inclusive of such means), then the secret is generally deemed to have been ''misappropriated''. Thus, if a trade secret has been acquired via industrial espionage, its acquirer will probably be subject to legal liability for having acquired it improperly. (The holder of the trade secret is nevertheless obliged to protect against such espionage to some degree in order to safeguard the secret. Under most trade secret regimes, a trade secret is not deemed to exist unless its purported holder takes reasonable steps to maintain its secrecy.){{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==History==

===Roman law===
Commentators starting with A. Arthur Schiller assert that trade secrets were protected under [[Roman law]] by a claim known as ''actio servi corrupti'', interpreted as an "action for making a slave worse" (or an action for corrupting a servant). The Roman law is described as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he Roman owner of a mark or firm name was legally protected against unfair usage by a competitor through the ''actio servi corrupti'' ... which the Roman jurists used to grant commercial relief under the guise of private law actions. "If, as the writer believes [writes Schiller], various private cases of action were available in satisfying commercial needs, the state was acting in exactly the same fashion as it does at the present day."&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;Alan Watson, ''Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded'', 11 Tul. Eur. &amp; Civ. L.F. 19, 19 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The suggestion that trade secret law has its roots in Roman law was introduced in 1929 in a ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'' article called "Trade Secrets and the Roman Law: The ''Actio Servi Corrupti''", which has been reproduced in Schiller's, ''An American Experience in Roman Law'' 1 (1971). See ''Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded'', at 19. However, the [[University of Georgia]] [[University of Georgia Law School|Law School]] professor [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]] argued in ''Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded ''that the ''actio servi corrupti'' was not used to protect trade secrets p.&amp;nbsp;19. Rather, he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Schiller is sadly mistaken as to what was going on. ... The ''actio servi corrupti'' presumably or possibly could be used to protect trade secrets and other similar commercial interests. That was not its purpose and was, at most, an incidental spin-off. But there is not the slightest evidence that the action was ever so used. In this regard the ''actio servi corrupti'' is not unique.

Exactly the same can be said of many private law actions including those for theft, damage to property, deposit, and production of property. All of these could, I suppose, be used to protect trade secrets, etc., but there is no evidence they were. It is bizarre to see any degree the Roman actio servi corrupti as the counterpart of modern law for the protection of trade secrets and other such commercial interests.&lt;ref name="watson"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===19th century===

Trade secret law as we know it today made its first appearance in England in 1817 in ''[[Newbery v. James]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Newbery v. James'', (1817) 2 Mer. 446, 35 Eng. Rep. 1011, 1013 (Ct. Ch. 1817)&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|1=History|date=October 2014|reason=See doubts raised at [[Talk:Trade secret/Archives/2014#History]]}} and in the United States in 1837 in ''[[Vickery v. Welch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Vickery v. Welch'', 36 Mass. (19 Pick.) 523, 527 (1837)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="surprising"&gt;See The Surprising Virtues of Treating Trade Secrets as IP Rights'', 61 Stan. L.

Winyard'', (1820) 37 Eng. Rep. 425, 426 (Ch.)&lt;/ref&gt; while in the United States, it took until the 1866 case ''Taylor v. Blanchard''.&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v. Blanchard'', 95 Mass.

Trade secrets law continued to evolve throughout the United States as a hodgepodge of state laws. In 1939, the [[American Law Institute]] issued the [[Restatement of Torts]], containing a summary of trade secret laws across states, which served as the primary resource until the latter part of the century. As of 2013, however, only four states—Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Texas—still rely on the Restatement as their primary source of guidance (other than their body of state case law).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It has also been recently{{when|date=September 2014}} theorized that the doctrine of trade secrets should protect competitively valuable, personal information of company executives, in a concept known as "executive trade secrets".

===Worldwide===

====Commonwealth nations====
In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[common law]] jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] right rather than a [[property]] right.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=====England and Wales=====
{{See also|Breach of confidence in English law}}
The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] in the case of ''Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v. Campbell Engineering Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;''Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v. Campbell Engineering Ltd'', (1948) 65 P.R.C. 203&lt;/ref&gt; held that the action for breach of confidence is based on a principle of preserving "good faith".

The test for a cause of action for breach of confidence in the [[common law]] world is set out in the case of ''Coco v. A.N. Clark (Engineers) Ltd'':&lt;ref&gt;''Coco v. A.N. Clark (Engineers) Ltd'', (1969) R.P.C. 41 at 47&lt;/ref&gt;

* The information itself must have the necessary quality of confidence about it;
* That information must have been imparted in circumstances imparting an obligation of confidence;
* There must be an unauthorized use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it.

The "quality of confidence" highlights that trade secrets are a legal concept. With sufficient effort or through illegal acts (such as breaking and entering), competitors can usually obtain trade secrets. However, so long as the owner of the trade secret can prove that reasonable efforts have been made to keep the information confidential, the information remains a trade secret and generally remains legally protected. Conversely, trade secret owners who cannot evidence reasonable efforts at protecting confidential information risk losing the trade secret, even if the information is obtained by competitors illegally. It is for this reason that trade secret owners shred documents and do not simply recycle them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

A successful plaintiff is entitled to various forms of [[judicial relief]], including:

* An [[injunction]]
* An [[account of profits]] or an award of [[damages]]
* A [[Declaration (law)|declaration]]

=====Hong Kong=====
[[Hong Kong]] does not follow the traditional commonwealth approach, instead recognizing trade secrets where a judgment of the High Court indicates that confidential information may be a property right.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

====European Union====
The EU adopted a [[Directive on the Protection of Trade Secrets]] on 27 May 2016.&lt;ref name=eudirective&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade secrets|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/intellectual-property/trade-secrets_en|website=European Commission|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the directive is to harmonize the definition of trade secrets in accordance with existing international standards, and the means of obtaining protection of trade secrets within the EU.&lt;ref name=eudirective/&gt;

====United States====
Within the U.S., trade secrets generally encompass a company's proprietary information that is not generally known to its competitors, and which provides the company with a competitive advantage.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Although trade secrets law evolved under state common law, prior to 1974, the question of whether patent law preempted state trade secrets law had been unanswered.  In 1974, the [[United States Supreme Court]] issued the landmark decision, ''Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.,'' which resolved the question in favor of allowing the states to freely develop their own trade secret laws.&lt;ref&gt;''Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.'', 416 U.S. 470, 94 S.Ct. 1879, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====State law=====
In 1979 several U.S. states adopted the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]] (UTSA), which was further amended in 1985, with approximately 47 states having adopted some variation of it as the basis for trade secret law. Another significant development is the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996|Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996]] ({{usc|18|1831|1839}}), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. 

This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity.
# {{uscsub|18|1831|a}}, criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers.
# {{usc|18|1832}}, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes.
The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.
The EEA was extended in 2016 to allow companies to file civil suits in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericgoldman/2016/04/28/the-new-defend-trade-secrets-act-is-the-biggest-ip-development-in-years/|title=The New 'Defend Trade Secrets Act' Is The Biggest IP Development In Years|journal=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]|date=April 28, 2016|first=Eric|last=Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Federal law=====
On May 11, 2016, President Obama signed the [[Defend Trade Secrets Act]] (DTSA), 18 U.S.C.§§1839 et seq., which for the first time created a federal cause of action for misappropriating trade secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2016/05/24/defintion-trade-secret-dtsa/id=69262/|title=Definition of a 'Trade Secret' Under the DTSA|last=Toren|first=Peter J.|date=May 24, 2016|publisher=IPWatchdog|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DTSA provides for both a private right of action for damages and injunction and a civil action for injunction brought by the Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/news/2016/06/protections_of_then.html|title=Protections of the Newly Enacted Defend Trade Secrets Act|last=Kelton|first=Jeff|date=June 24, 2016|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The statute followed state laws on liability in significant part, defining trade secrets in the same way as the Uniform Trade Secrets Act as,
{{quote|"all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or codes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether or how stored, compiled, or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing if (A) the owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret; and (B) the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, another person who can obtain economic value from the disclosure or use of the information."}}
However, the law contains several important differences from prior law.
# Because it is a federal law, trade secret cases can be prosecuted in federal courts with concomitant procedural advantages.
# It provides for the unusual remedy of preliminary seizure of "property necessary to prevent the propagation or dissemination of the trade secret," 18 U.S.C. §1836
# It provides for remedies to include royalties in appropriate cases and exemplary damages up to two times the actual damages in cases of "willful and malicious" appropriation, 18 U.S.C. §1836(b)(3).
The DTSA also clarifies that a United States resident (including a company) can be liable for misappropriation that takes place outside the United States, and any person can be liable as long as an act in furtherance of the misappropriation takes place in the United States, 18 U.S.C. §1837. The DTSA provides the courts with broad injunctive powers.  18 U.S.C. §1836(b)(3).

The DTSA does not preempt or supplant state laws, but provides an additional cause of action.  Because states vary significantly in their approach to the "inevitable disclosure" doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;The "inevitable disclosure" doctrine allows an employee's new employment to be enjoined if the court determines that the nature of his new duties will inevitably lead to a disclosure or improper use of trade secrets of the prior employer.  It has been accepted in a number of states (see, e.g., PepsiCo, Inc. v. Redmond, 54 F.3d 1262 (7th Cir. 1995)(applying Illinois law), and flatly rejected in others (see, e.g., Schlage Lock Co. v. Whyte, 101 Cal. App. 4th 1443 (2002) (applying California law).&lt;/ref&gt; its use has limited, if any, application under the DTSA, 18 U.S.C.§1836(b)(3)(A).&lt;ref&gt;A Court may grant an injunction, provided the order does not "prevent a person from entering into an employment relationship, and that conditions placed on such employment shall be based on evidence of threatened misappropriation and not merely on the information that the person knows...." 18 U.S.C. §1836(b)(3)(A)(i)(I).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other types of intellectual property law==
In the United States, trade secrets are not protected by law in the same manner as [[patent]]s or [[trademark]]s. Specifically, trademarks and patents are protected under federal statutes, the [[Lanham Act]] and [[United States patent law|Patent Act]], respectively. In contrast, trade secrets are protected under [[state law]]s, and most states have enacted the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]] (UTSA), except for [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[North Carolina]]. One of the differences between patents and trademarks, on the one hand, and trade secrets, on the other, is that a trade secret is protected only when the secret is {{clarify span|text=not disclosed.|explain=by their "owner"? What about leaks?|date=March 2018}}

===Comparison with trademarks===
Nations have different trademark policies. Assuming the mark in question meets certain other standards of protectibility, trademarks are generally protected from infringement on the grounds that other uses might confuse consumers as to the origin or nature of the goods once the mark has been associated with a particular supplier. Similar considerations apply to [[service mark]]s and [[trade dress]].

By definition, a trademark enjoys no protection (''qua'' trademark) until and unless it is "disclosed" to consumers, for only then are consumers able to associate it with a supplier or source in the requisite manner. (That a company plans to ''use'' a certain trademark might itself be protectible as a trade secret, however, until the mark is actually made public.)

To acquire a [[United States trademark law|trademark rights under U.S. law]], one must simply use the mark "in commerce".&lt;ref name="USPTO-FAQ"&gt;United States Patent and Trademark Office, [http://www.uspto.gov/main/faq/index.html General Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible to register a trademark in the United States, both at the federal and state levels.  Registration of trademarks confers some advantages, including stronger protection in certain respects, but registration is not required in order to get protection.&lt;ref name="USPTO-FAQ"/&gt; Registration may be required in order to file a lawsuit for trademark infringement.

===Comparison with patents===
To acquire a patent, full information about the method or product has to be supplied to the patent office and upon publication or issuance, will then be available to all. After expiration of the patent, competitors can copy the method or product legally. The temporary [[monopoly]] on the subject matter of the patent is regarded as a tradeoff for thus disclosing the information to the public.

One popular misconception held by many is that trade secret protection is incompatible with patent protection. It is typically said that if one applies for a patent one can no longer maintain a trade secret on the invention, but this is an oversimplification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordasecrets.com/2008/04/patenttrade_secret_complementa.html Jorda on Trade Secrets] by Karl Jorda&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain a patent, the inventor must [[sufficiency of disclosure|disclose the invention]], so that others will be able to both make and use the invention. Also, to obtain a patent in the United States, any preferences{{clarify|reason=What is meant by a "preference" here?|date=February 2016}} must likewise be disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112 |title=35 U.S.C. 112 |publisher=Uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615191627/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112 |archivedate=2006-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; What is typically not appreciated though is that the critical time for satisfying this disclosure requirement is at the time the application is filed. In many if not most situations, improvements will be made to an invention even after filing of the patent application, and additional information will be learned. None of this additional information must be disclosed and can instead be kept as a secret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/2100_2165_01.htm#sect2165.01 Considerations Relevant to Best Mode] MPEP 2165.01&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all patent licenses include clauses that require the inventor to disclose any trade secrets they have. Frequently it is this information not disclosed in the patent that is the most commercially viable. Thus, patent licensors should take steps to continue to maintain trade secrets as secrets, otherwise they will be lost. Accordingly, before disclosing any secrets not already protected by an issued patent the licensor will use a [[non-disclosure agreement]].

Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are that a trade secret is not limited in time (it "continues indefinitely as long as the secret is not revealed to the public", whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention), a trade secret does not imply any registration costs,&lt;ref name="klinkert-6"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.miplc.de/research/lecture-series/ |title=The Misappropriation of Trade Secrets in Germany and U.S. Discovery Aid |first=Friedrich |last=Klinkert |date=April 2012 |conference=[[Munich Intellectual Property Law Center|MIPLC]] Lecture Series |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an immediate effect, does not require compliance with any formalities, and does not imply any disclosure of the invention to the public.&lt;ref name="klinkert-6"/&gt; The disadvantages of trade secrets include that "others may be able to legally discover the secret and be thereafter entitled to use it", "others may obtain patent protection for legally discovered secrets", and a trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent.&lt;ref name="klinkert-7"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.miplc.de/research/lecture-series/ |title=The Misappropriation of Trade Secrets in Germany and U.S. Discovery Aid |first=Friedrich |last=Klinkert |date=April 2012 |conference=[[Munich Intellectual Property Law Center|MIPLC]] Lecture Series |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Trade secret regulations that mask the composition of chemical agents in [[consumer product]]s have been criticized for allowing the trade secret holders to hide the presence of potentially harmful and [[Toxicity|toxic substances]]. It has been argued that the public is being denied a clear picture of such products' safety, whereas competitors are well positioned to analyze its chemical composition.&lt;ref name=fitzgerald&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Randall Fitzgerald]]| title=[[The Hundred Year Lie]] |publisher=[[Dutton Penguin|Dutton]], 2006| page=24 |isbn=0-525-94951-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the National Environmental Trust tested 40 common consumer products; in more than half of them they found toxic substances not listed on the [[product label]].&lt;ref name=fitzgerald/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3115">Under a '''Unilateral Policy''' (or "Colgate Policy" or "Unilateral Minimum Retail Price Policy") a manufacturer, without any agreement with the reseller, announces a minimum resale price and refuses to make further sales to any reseller that sells below the announced price. Unilateral policy is a form of [[resale price maintenance]] that enables a manufacturer to influence the price at which its distributors and dealers resell its products without a formal contract regarding the resale price. The policy was first identified in ''[[United States v. Colgate &amp; Co.]]'', {{ussc|250|300|1919}}.

==Development==
Beginning with the [[Sherman Act]] in 1890 which banned, "every contract, combination …, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade" price fixing by the manufacturer was held to be illegal. In ''[[Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park and Sons]]'', {{ussc|220|373|1911}}, the United States Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's holding that a massive minimum resale price maintenance scheme was unreasonable and thus offended Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The decision rested on the assertion that minimum resale price maintenance is indistinguishable in economic effect from naked horizontal price fixing by a cartel. Subsequent decisions characterized Dr Miles as holding that minimum resale price maintenance is unlawful ''per se'' - that is, without regard to its impact on the marketplace or consumers.

While vertical price agreements remained taboo, in 1919 the Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Colgate &amp; Co.]]'', recognized the manufacturer's right to deal with whomever it wanted, and as importantly, its right to refuse to deal. This distinction allowed manufacturers to announce terms under which they would deal with their resellers and then refuse to deal with those who failed to comply. ''Colgate'''s progeny in 1984 further built upon this right in ''[[Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp.]]'', stating that, "under Colgate, the manufacturer can announce its re-sale prices in advance and refuse to deal with those who fail to comply, and a distributor is free to acquiesce to the manufacturer's demand in order to avoid termination".

"Colgate policies" are independently adopted and announced by the manufacturer. The manufacturer, without any agreement with the reseller, announces a minimum resale price and refuses to make further sales to any reseller that fails to sell at or above the announced price. There is no contract and the parties do not agree on the price. Aside from suggesting retail prices or having the reseller act as an agent of the manufacturer and sell the goods on consignment, until the 2007 ''[[Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.]]'' decision a Unilateral Policy was the only way that a manufacturer could directly influence a reseller's retail price without subjecting itself to ''[[Illegal per se|per se]]'' liability for price fixing.

The '''Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action''', also known as '''VDPA''', is a [[human rights]] declaration adopted by consensus at the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] on 25 June 1993 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The position of [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] was recommended by this Declaration and subsequently created by [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] Resolution 48/121.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/ViennaWC.aspx|title=OHCHR - World Conference on Human Rights|author=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The VDPA reaffirmed the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[United Nations Charter]]. Its Preamble states "The World Conference on Human Rights, Considering that the promotion and protection of human rights is a matter of priority for the international community, and that the Conference affords a unique opportunity to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the international human rights system and of the machinery for the protection of human rights, in order to enhance and thus promote a fuller observance of those rights, in a just and balanced manner."

The Preamble also states: "Invoking the spirit of our age and the realities of our time which call upon the peoples of the world and all States Members of the United Nations to rededicate themselves to the global task of promoting and protecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms so as to secure full and universal enjoyment of these rights ..."

===Looking back===
The VDPA reflects the fact that the World Conference on Human Rights marked a turning point for human rights, as the [[Cold War]] had ended. The VDPA looks back, with the Preamble stating:

{{Quote|Recalling also the determination expressed in the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to establish conditions under which justice and respect for obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, to practice tolerance and good neighborliness, and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples.}}

===Human rights as relevant universal standard===
The VDPA seeks to reaffirm human rights as universal and relevant standard. The Preamble states: "Emphasizing that the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which constitutes a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, is the source of inspiration and has been the basis for the United Nations in making advances in standard setting as contained in the existing international human rights instruments, in particular the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]."

The VDPA urges Governments, [[United Nations]], and other international organizations to increase the resources allocated to programmes to strengthen human rights awareness through training, teaching and education, popular participation and civil society (para. 34).

===Human rights as indivisible, interdependent and interrelated===
The VDPA emphasizes that all human rights are of equal importance, seeking to end the qualitative division between [[civil and political rights]] and [[economic, social and cultural rights]], which was pronounced during the Cold War era. Part I, para 5 states that "All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated. The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis. While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms." This phrase is also cited by the [[Declaration of Montreal]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Declaration of Montreal]] Section 2, "Global Issue"&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[The Yogyakarta Principles]]&lt;ref&gt;[[The Yogyakarta Principles]] Principle 1, (a)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] Preamble, (c)&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, Part II, para 75 also encourages the Commission on Human Rights, in accordance with the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], to continue the examination of [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] on equal basis of the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

===Democracy, development and human rights against terrorism===
The VDPA also draws a direct connection between respect for human rights, [[democracy]] and [[international development]], stating in Part I, para 8: "8. Democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives. In the context of the above, the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels should be universal and conducted without conditions attached. The international community should support the strengthening and promoting of democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the entire world." In Part I, para 17: "The act, methods and practices of [[terrorism]] in all its form" as well as [[drug trafficking]] "are activities aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedom and democracy" and that "the international community should take necessary steps to enhance cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism".

===Poverty and social exclusion===
The VDPA makes a direct link between [[poverty]] and the realisation of human rights. Part I, para 14 states: "The existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and effective enjoyment of human rights; its immediate alleviation and eventual elimination must remain a high priority for the international community." The VDPA stops short of declaring poverty a human rights violation in itself, but states in Part I, para 25 that: "25. The World Conference on Human Rights affirms that [[extreme poverty]] and [[social exclusion]] constitute a violation of human dignity and that urgent steps are necessary to achieve better knowledge of extreme poverty and its causes, including those related to the problem of development, in order to promote the human rights of the poorest, and to put an end to extreme poverty and social exclusion and to promote the enjoyment of the fruits of social progress. It is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the [[decision making]] process by the community in which they live, the promotion of human rights and efforts to combat extreme poverty."

===Right to development===
The VDPA reaffirms the [[right to development]], which is regarded as controversial by some human rights scholars and [[UN member states]]. Part I, para 9 reaffirms that [[least developed countries]] committed to the process of democratization and economic reforms, many of which are in [[Africa]], should be supported by the international community in order to succeed in their transition to democracy and [[economic development]]. And Part I, para 10 states: "The World Conference on Human Rights reaffirms the right to development, as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development, as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights. As stated in the Declaration on the Right to Development, the human person is the central subject of development. While development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of development may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human rights. States should cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development. The international community should promote an effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination of obstacles to development. Lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level."

Part I, para 11 goes on to state: "The right to development should be fulfilled so as to meet equitably the developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations. The World Conference on Human Rights recognizes that illicit dumping of toxic and dangerous substances and waste potentially constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life and health of everyone. Consequently, the World Conference on Human Rights calls on all States to adopt and vigorously implement existing conventions relating to the dumping of toxic and dangerous products and waste and to cooperate in the prevention of illicit dumping. Everyone has the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications. The World Conference on Human Rights notes that certain advances, notably in the biomedical and life sciences as well as in information technology, may have potentially adverse consequences for the integrity, dignity and human rights of the individual, and calls for international cooperation to ensure that human rights and dignity are fully respected in this area of universal concern."

===Right to seek asylum and humanitarian aid===
In Part I, para 23, the VDPA reaffirms that everyone, without distinction of any kind, is entitled to the right to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution, as well as the right to return to one's own country. In this respect it stresses the importance of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the 1951 [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]], its 1967 Protocol and regional instruments. It expresses its appreciation to States that continue to admit and host large numbers of refugees in their territories, and to the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] for its dedication to its task. It also expresses its appreciation to the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]]. The VDPA recognises that, in view of the complexities of the global refugee crisis and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, relevant international instruments and international solidarity and in the spirit of burden-sharing, a comprehensive approach by the international community is needed in coordination and cooperation with the countries concerned and relevant organisations, bearing in mind the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. This should include the development of strategies to address the root causes and effects of movements of refugees and other displaced persons, the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms, the provision of effective protection and assistance, bearing in mind the special needs of women and children, as well as the achievement of durable solutions, primarily through the preferred solution of dignified and safe voluntary repatriations, including solutions such as those adopted by the international refugee conferences. And underlines the responsibilities of States, particularly as they relate to the countries of origin. Regarding disasters, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of humanitarian law, VDPA emphasizes the importance of and the need for [[humanitarian aid]] to victims of all [[natural disaster]] and [[man-made disaster]].

===Against racism, xenophobia and intolerance===
In Part II, para 20, the VDPA urges all governments to take immediate measure and to develop strong policies to prevent and combat all forms and manifestations of [[racism]], [[xenophobia]] or related [[Toleration|intolerance]], where necessary by enactment of appropriate legislation, including penal measure. And also appeals to all States parties to the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] to consider making the declaration under article 14 of the Convention.

===Persons belonging to minority groups===
In Part II, para 25, the VDPA calls on the Commission on Human Rights to examine ways and means to promote and protect effectively the rights of persons belonging to [[minority group|minorities]] as set out in the [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]]. In this context, VDPA calls upon the Centre for Human Rights to provide, at the request of Governments concerned and as part of its programme of advisory services and technical assistance, qualified expertise on [[minority rights|minority issues]] and human rights, as well as on the prevention and resolution of disputes, to assist in existing or potential situations involving minorities. At para 26, the VDPA urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities in accordance with the Declaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. Further at para 95, VDPA underlines the importance of preserving and strengthening the system of special procedures, rapporteurs, representatives, experts and working groups of the Commission on Human Rights and the [[Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities]], in order to enable them to carry out their mandates in all countries throughout the world, providing them with the necessary human and financial resources. The procedures and mechanisms should be enabled to harmonize and rationalize their work through periodic meeting. All States are asked to cooperate fully with these procedures and mechanisms.

===Indigenous peoples===
In Part II, para 29, the VDPA recommends that the [[Commission on Human Rights]] consider the renewal and updating of the mandate of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations upon complement of the drafting of the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]. Further at para 32, it recommends that the General Assembly proclaim an international decade of the world's indigenous people, to begin from January 1994, including action oriented programmes, to be decided upon in partnership with [[indigenous people]]. An appropriate voluntary trust fund should be set up for this purpose. In the framework of such a decade, the establishment of a permanent forum for indigenous peoples in the United Nations system should be considered.

===Rights of migrant workers===
In Part II, para 34, the VDPA invites States to consider the possibility of signing and ratifying on the earliest possible time, the [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]].

===Women's rights and domestic violence===
The VDPA draws attention to the importance of [[women's rights]] and the rights of the "girl-child", Part I, para 18 stating: "The human rights of women and of the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. The full and equal participation of women in political, civil, economic, social and cultural life, at the national, regional and international levels, and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the [[international community]]."

The VDPA also explicitly recognises [[gender-based violence]], [[sexual harassment]] and exploitation, with Part I, para 18 going on to state: "Gender-based violence and all forms of sexual harassment and exploitation, including those resulting from cultural prejudice and international trafficking, are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person, and must be eliminated. This can be achieved by legal measures and through national action and international cooperation in such fields as economic and social development, education, safe maternity and health care, and social support."

The VDPA concludes by proclaiming [[women's rights]] and gender-based exploitation as legitimate issues for the international community. Part I, para 19 concluding that: "The human rights of women should form an integral part of the United Nations human rights activities, including the promotion of all human rights instruments relating to women. The World Conference on Human Rights urges Governments, institutions, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify their efforts for the protection and promotion of human rights of women and the girl-child."

The VDPA, at Part II, para 38, also calls upon the General Assembly to adopt the draft [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] and urges States to combat [[violence against women]] in accordance with its provisions, and that "violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict are violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law. All violations of this kind, including in particular murder, systematic [[rape]], [[sexual slavery]], and forced [[pregnancy]], require a particular effective response."

===Rights of the child===
In Part II, para 45, the VDPA reiterates the principle of "First Call for Children" and, in this respect, underlines the importance of major national and international efforts, especially those of the [[United Nations Children's Fund]], for promoting respect for the rights of the child to survival, protection, development and participation. At para 46, VDPA affirms that measures should be taken to achieve universal ratification of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] by 1995 and the universal signing of the "World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children and Plan of Action" adopted by the [[World Summit for Children]]. At para 47, the VDPA urges all nations to undertake measures to the maximum extent of their available resources, with the support of international cooperation, to achieve the goals in the World Summit Plan of Action, and calls on States to integrate the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] into their national action plans. By means of those national action plans and through international efforts, particular priority should be places on reducing [[infant mortality]] and [[maternal mortality]] rates, reducing [[malnutrition]] and [[illiteracy]] rates and providing access to safe [[drinking water]] and to basic education. Whenever so called for, national plans of action should be devised to combat devastating emergencies resulting from [[natural disaster]]s and [[armed conflict]]s and the equally grave problem of children in extreme poverty. At para 48, the VDPA urges all States, to address the acute program of children under difficult circumstance. Exploitation and abuse of children should be actively combated, including by addressing their root causes. Effective measure are required against female [[infanticide]], harmful [[child labour]], [[sale of children]] and organ, [[child prostitution]], [[child pornography]], as well as other forms of sexual abuse. At para 50, the VDPA strongly supports the proposal that the Secretary General initiate a study into means of improving the protection of children in armed conflicts, and that humanitarian norms should be implemented and measures taken in order to protect and facilitate assistance to children in war zone. Measures should include protection for children against indiscriminate use of all weapon of war, especially [[anti-personnel mine]]s. The need for aftercare and rehabilitation of children traumatized by war must be addressed urgently.

===Freedom from torture===
In Part II, para 54, the VDAP welcomes the ratification by many Member States of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] and at para 61, also reaffirm that effort to eradicate torture should, first and foremost, be concentrated on prevention and, therefore, calls for early adoption of an [[Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture]], which is intended to establish a preventive system of regular visits to places of detention.

===Enforced disappearances===
In Part II, para 62, the VDAP welcoming the adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, calls upon all States to take effective legislative, administrative, judicial on other measure to prevent, terminate and punish acts of [[enforced disappearance]]. This is the origin of the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]].

===Rights of the disabled person===
In Part II, para 63, the VDAP reaffirms that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal and thus unreservedly include persons with [[disability|disabilities]]. Every person is born equal and has the same rights to [[life]] and [[welfare]], [[education]] and [[Employment|work]], living independently and active participation in all aspects of society. Any direct discrimination or other negative discriminatory treatment of a disabled person is therefore a violation of his or her rights. At para 64, the VDAP affirms that the place of disabled person is everywhere. Persons with disabilities should be guaranteed equal opportunity through the elimination of all socially determined barriers, be they physical, financial, social or psychological, which exclude or restrict full participation in society.

===Human rights, the responsibility of the State===
Part I, para 1 of the VDPA starts: "The World Conference on Human Rights reaffirms the solemn commitment of all States to fulfill their obligations to promote universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, other instruments relating to human rights, and international law. The universal nature of these rights and freedoms is beyond question."

The VDPA acknowledges that international cooperation to realise human rights is vital, Part I, para 1 going on to state: "In this framework, enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human rights is essential for the full achievement of the purposes of the United Nations." However, the VDPA firmly places the ultimate responsibility for realizing human rights with the State, or the respective governments, Part I, para 1 concluding that: "Human rights and fundamental freedoms are the birthright of all human beings; their protection and promotion is the first responsibility of Governments."
Recognising the rising importance of NGOs, the VDPA states in Part I, para 13: "There is a need for States and international organizations, in cooperation with non-governmental organizations, to create favourable conditions at the national, regional and international levels to ensure the full and effective enjoyment of human rights. States should eliminate all violations of human rights and their causes, as well as obstacles to the enjoyment of these rights."

On ratification of [[international human rights law|international treaties on human rights]], the VDPA states in Part I, para 26 that it "welcomes the progress made in the codification of [[international human rights instruments|human rights instruments]], which is a dynamic and evolving process, and urges the universal ratification of human rights treaties. All States are encouraged to accede to these international instruments; all States are encouraged to avoid, as far as possible, the resort to [[reservation (law)|reservations]]." On [[Legal remedy|remedy]] and [[redress]] of human rights violation, VDPA states in Part I, para 27 that "Every State should provide an effective framework of remedies and redress human rights grievances or violations. The administration of justice, including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and, especially, an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in [[international human rights instruments]], are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to the processes of democracy and [[sustainable development]]."

===Human rights education===
In Part II, para 78, the VDPA considers [[human rights education]], training and public information essential for the promotion and achievement of stable and harmonious relations among communities and for fostering mutual understanding, [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[peace]]. At para 79 it states that States should strive to eradicate [[illiteracy]] and should direct education towards the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The VDPA calls on all States and institutions to include [[international human rights law]], [[international humanitarian law]], [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]] as subjects in the curricula of all learning institutions in formal and non-formal settings, and, at para 80, that [[human rights education]] should include [[peace]], [[democracy]], development and [[social justice]], as set forth in international and regional human rights instruments, in order to achieve common understanding and awareness with a view to strengthening universal commitment to human rights. Further at para 81, the VDPA states that taking into account the World Plan of Action on Education for Human Rights and Democracy, adopted in March 1993 by the International Congress on Education for Human Rights and Democracy of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]], and other human rights instruments, the VDPA recommends that States develop specific programs and strategies for ensuring the widest human rights education and the dissemination of public information, taking particular account of the human rights needs of women.

===Implementation and monitoring methods===
In Part II, para 83, the VDPA urges Governments to incorporate standard as contained in [[international human rights instruments]] in domestic legislation and to strengthen national structures, institutions and organs of society which play a role in protecting and safeguarding human rights. Para 84 recommends the strengthening of United Nations activities and programmes to meet requests for assistance by States which want to establish or strengthen their own [[national human rights institutions]] for promotion and protection of human rights.

At Part II, para 92, the VDPA recommends that the Commission on Human Rights examine the possibility for better implementation of existing human rights instruments at the international and regional levels and encourages the [[International Law Commission]] to continue its work on an [[International Criminal Court]]. Para 93 appeals to states which have not yet done so that accede to the [[Geneva Conventions]] of 12 August 1949 and the Protocols thereto, and to take all appropriate national measures, including legislative ones, for their full implementation. Para 96 recommends that the United Nations assume a more active role in the promotion and protection of human rights in ensuring full respect for [[international humanitarian law]] in all situations of armed conflict, in accordance with the purposes and principles of Charter of the United Nations. At para 97, the VDPA, recognizing the important role of human rights components in specific arrangements concerning some [[Peacekeeping]] Operations by United Nations, recommends that the Secretary-General take into account the reporting, experience and capabilities of the [[Centre for Human Rights]] and human rights mechanisms, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.

== Followup ==
Part II, para 99 The World Conference on Human Rights on Human Rights recommends that the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and other organs and agencies of the United Nations system related to human rights consider ways and means for the full implementation, without delay, of the recommendations contained in the present Declaration, including the possibility of proclaiming a United Nations decade for human rights. The World Conference on Human Rights further recommends that the Commission on Human Rights annually review the progress towards this end.

 Para 100:The World Conference on Human Rights requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to invite on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights all States, all organs and agencies of the United Nations system related to human rights, to report to him on the progress made in the implementation of the present Declaration and to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, through the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council. Likewise, regional and, as appropriate, national human rights institutions, as well as non-governmental may present their views to the Secretary-General on the progress made in the implementation of the present Declaration. Special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/Vienna.aspx|title=OHCHR - Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action|author=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights===
The VDPA considered the adaptation and strengthening of the United Nations machinery for human rights, including the question of the establishment of a [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]. Part II, para 17 states that "The World Conference on Human Rights recognizes the necessity for a continuing adaptation of the United Nations human rights machinery to the current and future needs in the promotion and protection of human rights, as reflected in the present Declaration... In particular, the United Nations human rights organs should improve their coordination, efficiency and effectiveness."

Following this the VDPA states, Part II, para 18, that "The World Conference on Human Rights recommends to the General Assembly that when examining the report of the Conference at its forty-eighth session, it begin, as a matter of priority, consideration of the question of the establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights for the promotion and protection of all human rights."

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] subsequently created the post of [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] on 20 December 1993 (resolution 48/141).

=== Country Action Plans ===
The World Conference on Human Rights recommended that each State consider the desirability of drawing up a national action plan identifying steps whereby that State would improve the promotion and protection of human rights. VDPA, Part II, paragraph 71. To such ends, the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights has included field offices and technical expertise to its mission. Further, the United Nations Development Programme has identified promotion of national institutions as one of its primary concerns.

===United Nations Human Rights Council===
The [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] holds regular debates (under its agenda item 8) on follow-up to the VDPA. While the scope of issues that can be addressed under this heading was [http://www.ishr.ch/archive-council/828-states-try-to-limit-discussion-of-country-situations-in-the-council initially disputed], recent sessions of the Human Rights Council have shown increasing debate on systematic follow-up to the VDPA, with States and non-governmental organizations raising a broad range of issues, reflecting the universal scope of the VDPA. This included themes like gender equality, sexual orientation and gender identity and institutional issues such as the independence of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ishr.ch/document-stuff/browse-documents/doc_download/1046-joint-ngo-statement-on-follow-up-and-implementation-of-the-vienna-declaration-under-item-8  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811134801/http://www.ishr.ch/document-stuff/browse-documents/doc_download/1046-joint-ngo-statement-on-follow-up-and-implementation-of-the-vienna-declaration-under-item-8 |date=11 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the Human Rights Council decided to hold a panel debate, in March 2013, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the VDPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/21/L.12|title=Human Rights Documents|author=|date=|website=ap.ohchr.org|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
