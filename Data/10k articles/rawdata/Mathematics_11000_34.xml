Over the [[GF(2)|finite field of order two]], conditions for the AOP to be irreducible are known, which allow this polynomial to be used to define efficient algorithms and circuits for [[multiplication]] in [[finite field]]s of characteristic two.&lt;ref name="hehcc"&gt;{{citation

==Definition==
An AOP of degree ''m'' has all terms from ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; with coefficients of 1, and can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;AOP_m(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{m} x^i&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;AOP_m(x) = x^m + x^{m-1} + \cdots + x + 1&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;AOP_m(x) = {x^{m+1} - 1\over{x-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the roots of the '''all one polynomial''' of degree ''m'' are all (''m''+1)th [[roots of unity]] other than unity itself.

==Properties==
Over GF(2) the AOP has many interesting properties, including:

*The [[Hamming weight]] of the AOP is ''m'' + 1, the maximum possible for its degree&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

*The AOP is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] if and only if ''m'' + 1 is prime and 2 is a [[primitive root modulo n|primitive root]] modulo ''m'' + 1&lt;ref name="hehcc"/&gt; (over GF(''p'') with prime ''p'', it is irreducible if and only if ''m'' + 1 is prime and ''p'' is a primitive root modulo ''m'' + 1)
*The only AOP that is a [[Primitive polynomial (field theory)|primitive polynomial]] is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + x + 1.

Despite the fact that the Hamming weight is large, because of the ease of representation and other improvements there are efficient implementations in areas such as [[coding theory]] and [[cryptography]].&lt;ref name="hehcc"/&gt;

Over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, the AOP is irreducible whenever ''m + 1'' is prime p, and therefore in these cases, the ''p''th [[cyclotomic polynomial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5472">'''Analytic and enumerative statistical studies''' are two types of [[scientific studies]]:

In any statistical study the ultimate aim is to provide a rational basis for action. Enumerative and analytic studies differ by where the action is taken. Deming first published on this topic in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deming|first=W. Edwards|date=June 1942|title=On a Classification of the Problems of Statistical Inference|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2279212|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=37|issue=218|pages=173|doi=10.2307/2279212|issn=0162-1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deming summarized the distinction between enumerative and analytic studies as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Deming, W. Edwards "On probability as a basis for action" The American Statistician, volume 29, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Enumerative study: A statistical study in which action will be taken on the material in the frame being studied.

Analytic study: A statistical study in which action will be taken on the process or cause-system that produced the frame being studied. The aim being to improve practice in the future.

(In a statistical study, the frame is the set from which the [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] is taken.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These terms were introduced in ''Some Theory of Sampling'' (1950, Chapter 7) by [[W. Edwards Deming]].

In other words, an enumerative study is a statistical study in which the focus is on judgment of results, and an analytic study is one in which the focus is on [[improvement of the process]] or system which created the results being evaluated and which will continue creating results in the future. A statistical study can be enumerative or analytic, but it cannot be both.

Statistical theory in enumerative studies is used to describe the precision of estimates and the validity of hypotheses for the population studied. In analytical studies, the standard error of a statistic does not address the most important source of uncertainty, namely, the change in study conditions in the future. Although analytical studies need to take into account the uncertainty due to sampling, as in enumerative studies, the attributes of the study design and analysis of the data primarily deal with the uncertainty resulting from extrapolation to the future (generalisation to the conditions in future time periods). The methods used in analytical studies encourage the exploration of mechanisms through multifactor designs, contextual variables introduced through blocking and replication over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kimbler|first=D. L.|date=May 1992|title=Review of: “Improving Quality Through Planned Experimentation” Ronald D. Moen, Thomas W. Nolan, and Lloyd P. Provost McGraw Hill, Inc. 1991|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07408179208964218|journal=IIE Transactions|volume=24|issue=2|pages=188–189|doi=10.1080/07408179208964218|issn=0740-817X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This distinction between enumerative and analytic studies is the theory behind the [[Fourteen Points for Management]]. Dr. Deming's philosophy is that management should be analytic instead of enumerative. In other words, management should focus on improvement of processes for the future instead of on judgment of current results.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Use of data requires knowledge about the different sources of uncertainty.
Measurement is a process. Is the system of measurement stable or unstable? Use
of data requires also understanding of the distinction between enumerative studies and analytic problems."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The interpretation of results of a test or experiment is something else. It is
prediction that a specific change in a process or procedure will be a wise choice, or that no change would be better. Either way the choice is prediction. This is known as an analytic problem, or a problem of inference, prediction."&lt;ref&gt;Deming, W. Edwards ''The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education - 1st Edition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Statistician Dr. [[Mike Tveite]] has pointed out the dangers of attempting to use an enumerative study for prediction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The behavioral approach to [[systems theory]] and [[control theory]] was initiated in the late-1970s by [[Jan Camiel Willems|J. C. Willems]] as a result of resolving inconsistencies present in classical approaches based on state-space, transfer function, and convolution representations. This approach is also motivated by the aim of obtaining a general framework for system analysis and control that respects the underlying [[physics]].

The main object in the behavioral setting is the behavior – the set of all signals compatible with the system. An important feature of the behavioral approach is that it does not distinguish a priority between input and output variables. Apart from putting system theory and control on a rigorous basis, the behavioral approach unified the existing approaches and brought new results on [[Controllability#Controllability in the behavioural framework|controllability for nD systems]], control via interconnection,&lt;ref name=control&gt;J.C. Willems On interconnections, control, and feedback IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control Volume 42, pages 326-339, 1997
Available online http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~jwillems/Articles/JournalArticles/1997.4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and system identification.&lt;ref name=sysid&gt;

Monograph 13 in “Mathematical Modeling and Computation”, SIAM, 2006. Available online http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~imarkovs/siam-book.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamical system as a set of signals ==

In the behavioral setting, a dynamical system is a triple 
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma=(\mathbb{T},\mathbb{W},\mathcal{B})&lt;/math&gt; 
where
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the "time set" – the time instances over which the system evolves,
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{W}&lt;/math&gt; is the "signal space" – the set in which the variables whose time evolution is modeled take on their values, and 
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}\subseteq \mathbb{W}^\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; the "behavior" – the set of signals that are compatible with the laws of the system 
:(&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{W}^\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of all signals, i.e., functions from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{W}&lt;/math&gt;). 
&lt;math&gt;w\in\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a trajectory of the system, while &lt;math&gt;w\notin\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; means that the laws of the system forbid the trajectory &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; to happen. Before the phenomenon is modeled, every signal in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{W}^\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is deemed possible, while after modeling, only the outcomes in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; remain as possibilities.

Special cases:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}=\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; – continuous-time systems 
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}=\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; – discrete-time systems 
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{W} = \mathbb{R}^q&lt;/math&gt; – most physical systems
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{W}&lt;/math&gt; a finite set – discrete event systems

== Linear time-invariant differential systems ==

System properties are defined in terms of the behavior. The system &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=(\mathbb{T},\mathbb{W},\mathcal{B})&lt;/math&gt; is said to be 
* "linear" if &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{W}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is a linear subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{W}^\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, 
* "time-invariant" if the time set consists of the real or natural numbers and
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^t\mathcal{B} \subseteq\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma^t&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;-shift, defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^t(f)(t'):=f(t'+t)&lt;/math&gt;. 
In these definitions linearity articulates the [[Superposition principle|superposition law]], while time-invariance articulates that the time-shift of a legal trajectory is in its turn a legal trajectory.

A "linear time-invariant differential system" is a dynamical system &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}^q,\mathcal{B})&lt;/math&gt; whose behavior &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the solution set of a system of constant coefficient linear ordinary differential equations &lt;math&gt;R(d/dt) w=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Polynomial matrix|matrix of polynomials]] with real coefficients. The coefficients of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are the parameters of the model. In order to define the corresponding behavior, we need to specify when we consider a signal &lt;math&gt;w:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^q&lt;/math&gt; to be a solution of &lt;math&gt;R(d/dt) w=0&lt;/math&gt;. For ease of exposition, often infinite differentiable solutions are considered. There are other possibilities, as taking distributional solutions, or solutions in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^{\rm local}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}^q)&lt;/math&gt;, and with the ordinary differential equations interpreted in the sense of distributions. The behavior defined is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B} = \{ w\in\mathcal{C}^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}^q) ~ | ~  R(d/dt) w(t) = 0 \text{ for all } t\in\mathbb{R}\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This particular way of representing the system is called "kernel representation" of the corresponding dynamical system. There are many other useful representations of the same behavior, including transfer function, state space, and convolution.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Observability of latent variables ==

A key question of the behavioral approach is whether a quantity w1 can be deduced given an observed quantity w2 and a [[Model (abstract)|model]]. If w1 can be deduced given w2 and the model, w2 is said to be [[observability|observable]]. In terms of mathematical modeling, the to-be-deduced quantity or [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] is often referred to as the [[latent variable]] and the observed variable is the manifest variable. Such a system is then called an observable (latent variable) system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1910">In mathematics, a '''Borel isomorphism''' is a measurable bijective function between two measurable [[Borel set | standard Borel]] spaces. By [[analytic set | Souslin's theorem ]] in standard Borel spaces (a set that is both [[Analytic set|analytic]] and [[coanalytic]] is necessarily Borel), the inverse of any such measurable bijective function is also measurable. Borel isomorphisms are closed under composition and under taking of inverses. The set of Borel isomorphisms from a space to itself clearly forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under composition. Borel isomorphisms on standard Borel spaces are analogous to [[homeomorphism]]s on [[topological space]]s: both are bijective and closed under composition, and a homeomorphism and its inverse are both [[Continuity (topology)|continuous]], instead of both being only Borel measurable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">In the [[foundations of mathematics]], '''classical mathematics''' refers generally to the mainstream approach to [[mathematics]], which is based on [[classical logic]] and [[ZFC set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic |editor=Stewart Shapiro |editor-link=Stewart Shapiro |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-514877-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It stands in contrast to other types of mathematics such as [[constructive mathematics]] or [[predicative mathematics]].  In practice, the most common non-classical systems are used in constructive mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Provability and Truth |author=Torkel Franzén |authorlink=Torkel Franzén |publisher=Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International |year=1987 |isbn=91-22-01158-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical mathematics is sometimes attacked on philosophical grounds, due to [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] and other objections to the logic, set theory, etc., chosen as its foundations, such as have been expressed by [[L. E. J. Brouwer]]. Almost all mathematics, however, is done in the classical tradition, or in ways compatible with it.

Defenders of classical mathematics, such as [[David Hilbert]], have argued that it is easier to work in, and is most fruitful; although they acknowledge non-classical mathematics has at times led to fruitful results that classical mathematics could not (or could not so easily) attain, they argue that on the whole, it is the other way round.

'''Dykstra's algorithm''' is a method that computes a point in the intersection of [[convex set]]s, and is a variant of the [[alternating projection]] method (also called the [[projections onto convex sets]] method).  In its simplest form, the method finds a point in the intersection of two convex sets by iteratively projecting onto each of the convex set; it differs from the alternating projection method in that there are intermediate steps. A parallel version of the algorithm was developed by Gaffke and Mathar.

The method is named after R. L. Dykstra who proposed it in the 1980s.

A key difference between Dykstra's algorithm and the standard alternating projection method occurs when there is more than one point in the intersection of the two sets. In this case, the alternating projection method gives some arbitrary point in this intersection, whereas Dykstra's algorithm gives a specific point: the projection of ''r'' onto the intersection, where ''r'' is the initial point used in the algorithm,

== Algorithm ==
[[File:Dykstra algorithm.svg|400px|right|thumb]]

Dykstra's algorithm finds for each &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the only &lt;math&gt; \bar{x} \in C\cap D&lt;/math&gt; such that:
: &lt;math&gt; \|\bar{x}-r\|^2\le \|x-r\|^2, \text{for all } x\in C \cap D, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C,D&lt;/math&gt; are [[convex set]]s.  This problem is equivalent to finding the [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]] of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; onto the set &lt;math&gt;C\cap D&lt;/math&gt;, which we denote by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_{C \cap D}&lt;/math&gt;.

To use Dykstra's algorithm, one must know how to project onto the sets &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; separately.

First, consider the basic [[alternating projection]] (aka POCS) method (first studied, in the case when the sets &lt;math&gt;C,D&lt;/math&gt; were linear subspaces, by [[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref&gt;J. von Neumann, On rings of operators. Reduction theory, Ann. of Math. 50 (1949) 401–485 (a reprint of lecture notes first distributed in 1933).&lt;/ref&gt;), which initializes &lt;math&gt;x_0=r&lt;/math&gt; and then generates the sequence

: &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1} = \mathcal{P}_C \left( \mathcal{P}_D ( x_k ) \right) &lt;/math&gt;.

Dykstra's algorithm is of a similar form, but uses additional auxiliary variables. Start with &lt;math&gt;x_0 =r, p_0=q_0=0&lt;/math&gt; and update by

: &lt;math&gt; y_k = \mathcal{P}_D( x_k + p_k ) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; p_{k+1} = x_k + p_k - y_k &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; x_{k+1} = \mathcal{P}_C( y_k + q_k ) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; q_{k+1} =y_k + q_k - x_{k+1}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then the sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; converges to the solution of the original problem. For convergence results and a modern perspective on the literature, see &lt;ref&gt;P. L. Combettes and J.-C. Pesquet, "Proximal splitting methods in signal processing," in: Fixed-Point Algorithms for Inverse Problems in Science and Engineering, (H. H. Bauschke, [[Regina S. Burachik|R. S. Burachik]], P. L. Combettes, V. Elser, D. R. Luke, and H. Wolkowicz, Editors), pp. 185–212. Springer, New York, 2011 [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-9569-8_10]&lt;/ref&gt;

Face validity is often contrasted with [[content validity]] and [[construct validity]].

Some people use the term face validity to refer only to the validity of a test to observers who are not expert in testing methodologies. For instance, if a test is designed to measure whether children are good spellers, and parents are asked whether the test is a good test, this measures the face validity of the test. If an expert is asked instead, some people would argue that this does not measure face validity.&lt;ref&gt;Anastasi, A. (1988). ''Psychological testing''. New York: Macmillan, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction seems too careful for most applications.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Generally, face validity means that the test "looks like" it will work, as opposed to "has been shown to work".

==Simulation==
In simulation, the first goal of the system designer is to construct a system which can support a task to be accomplished, and to record the learner's task performance for any particular trial. The task(s)—and therefore, the task performance—on the simulator should be representative of the real world that they model. Face validity is a subjective measure of the extent to which this selection appears reasonable ''on the face of it''—that is, subjectively to an expert after only a superficial examination of the content. Some assume that it is representative of the realism of the system, according to users and others who are knowledgeable about the real system being simulated.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, J. (2005). ''Discrete-Event System Simulation''. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Those would say that if these experts feel the model is adequate, then it has face validity. However, in fact ''face validity'' refers to the test, not the system.

In [[mathematics]], a '''fractal sequence''' is one that contains itself as a proper subsequence.  An example is

::1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...

If the first occurrence of each n is deleted, the remaining sequence is identical to the original.  The process can be repeated indefinitely, so that actually, the original sequence contains not only one copy of itself, but rather, infinitely many.

==Definition==

The precise definition of fractal sequence depends on a preliminary definition: a sequence ''x = (x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)'' is an '''infinitive sequence''' if for every ''i'',

::(F1)   ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = i'' for infinitely many ''n''.

Let ''a(i,j)'' be the ''jth'' index ''n'' for which ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = i''.  An infinitive sequence ''x'' is a '''fractal sequence''' if two additional conditions hold:

::(F2)   if ''i+1 = x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', then there exists ''m &lt; n'' such that 
:::&lt;math&gt;i=x_m&lt;/math&gt;

::(F3)   if ''h &lt; i'' then for every ''j'' there is exactly one ''k'' such that

:::&lt;math&gt;a(i,j) &lt; a(h,k) &lt; a(i,j+1).&lt;/math&gt;

According to (F2), the first occurrence of each ''i &gt; 1'' in ''x'' must be preceded at least once by each of the numbers 1, 2, ..., i-1, and according to (F3), between consecutive occurrences of ''i'' in ''x'', each ''h'' less than ''i'' occurs exactly once.

==Example==

Suppose θ is a positive irrational number.  Let

::S(θ) = the set of numbers c + dθ, where c and d are positive integers

and let

::c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(θ) + θd&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(θ)

be the sequence obtained by arranging the numbers in S(θ) in increasing order.  The sequence c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(θ) is the ''signature of θ'', and it is a fractal sequence.

For example, the signature of the [[golden ratio]] (i.e., θ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2) begins with

::1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 6, 3, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, 8, 5, ...

and the signature of 1/θ = θ - 1 begins with

::1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, ...

These are sequences {{OEIS2C|A084531}} and {{OEIS2C|A084532}} in the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]], where further examples from a variety of number-theoretic and combinatorial settings are given.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31101">In [[mathematics]], especially in [[order theory]], a '''Galois connection''' is a particular correspondence (typically) between two [[partially ordered set]]s (posets). The same notion can also be defined on [[preordered set]]s or [[preordered class|classes]]; this article presents the common case of posets. Galois connections generalize the correspondence between [[subgroup]]s and [[field (mathematics)|subfields]] investigated in [[Galois theory]] (named after the French mathematician [[Évariste Galois]]). They find applications in various mathematical theories.

A Galois connection is rather weak compared to an [[order isomorphism]] between the involved posets, but every Galois connection gives rise to an isomorphism of certain sub-posets, as will be explained below.

The literature contains two closely related notions of "Galois connection". In this article, we will distinguish between the two by referring to the first as '''(monotone) Galois connection''' and to the second as '''antitone Galois connection'''.

The term '''Galois correspondence''' is sometimes used to mean [[bijective]] ''Galois connection''; this is simply an [[order isomorphism]] (or dual order isomorphism, depending on whether we take monotone or antitone Galois connections).

== Definitions ==

=== (Monotone) Galois connection ===
Let {{math|(''A'', ≤)}} and {{math|(''B'', ≤)}} be two [[partially ordered set]]s. A ''monotone Galois connection'' between these posets consists of two [[monotone function|monotone]]&lt;ref&gt;Monotonicity follows from the following condition. See the discussion of the [[#Properties|properties]]. It is only explicit in the definition to distinguish it from the alternative ''antitone'' definition. One can also define Galois connections as a pair of monotone functions that satisfy the laxer condition that for all {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|A}}, {{math|''x'' ≤ ''g''(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;(''x''))}} and for all y in B, f(g(y)) ≤ y.&lt;/ref&gt; [[function (mathematics)|functions]]: {{math|''F'' : ''A'' → ''B''}} and {{math|''G'' : ''B'' → ''A''}}, such that for all {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|B}}, we have

:{{math|''F''(''a'') ≤ ''b''}} [[if and only if]] {{math|''a'' ≤ ''G''(''b'')}}.

In this situation, {{mvar|F}} is called the '''lower adjoint''' of {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|G}} is called the '''upper adjoint''' of ''F''. Mnemonically, the upper/lower terminology refers to where the function application appears relative to ≤.&lt;ref&gt;Gierz, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The term "adjoint" refers to the fact that monotone Galois connections are special cases of pairs of [[adjoint functor]]s in [[category theory]] as discussed further below. Other terminology encountered here is '''left adjoint''' (respectively '''right adjoint''') for the lower (respectively upper) adjoint.

An essential property of a Galois connection is that an upper/lower adjoint of a Galois connection ''uniquely'' determines the other:

:{{math|''F''(''a'')}} is the least element {{math|{{overset|~|''b''}} }} with {{math|''a'' ≤ ''G''({{overset|~|''b''}})}}, and 
:{{math|''G''(''b'')}} is the largest element {{mvar|{{overset|~|''a''}}}} with {{math|''F''({{overset|~|''a''}}) ≤ ''b''}}.

A consequence of this is that if {{mvar|F}} or {{mvar|G}} is [[Bijection|invertible]], then each is the [[Inverse function|inverse]] of the other, i.e. {{math|1=''F'' = ''G''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} .

Given a Galois connection with lower adjoint {{mvar|F}} and upper adjoint {{mvar|G}}, we can consider the compositions {{math|''GF'' : ''A'' → ''A''}}, known as the associated [[closure operator]], and {{math|''FG'' : ''B'' → ''B''}}, known as the associated kernel operator. Both are monotone and idempotent, and we have {{math|''a'' ≤ ''GF''(''a'')}} for all {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|A}} and {{math|''FG''(''b'') ≤ ''b''}} for all {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|B}}.

A '''Galois insertion''' of {{mvar|A}} into {{mvar|B}} is a Galois connection in which the closure operator {{mvar|GF}} is the identity on {{mvar|A}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Semirings for Soft Constraint Solving and Programming | volume=2962 | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | issn=0302-9743 | first=Stefano | last=Bistarelli | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=2004 | isbn=3-540-21181-0 | page=102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antitone Galois connection ===
The above definition is common in many applications today, and prominent in [[lattice (order)|lattice]] and [[domain theory]]. However the original notion in Galois theory is slightly different. In this alternative definition, a Galois connection is a pair of ''antitone'', i.e. order-reversing, functions {{math|''F'' : ''A'' → ''B''}} and {{math|''G'' : ''B'' → ''A''}} between two posets {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}, such that

:{{math|''b'' ≤ ''F''(''a'')}} if and only if {{math|''a'' ≤ ''G''(''b'')}}.

The symmetry of {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|G}} in this version erases the distinction between upper and lower, and the two functions are then called '''polarities''' rather than adjoints.&lt;ref&gt;Galatos, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Each polarity uniquely determines the other, since

:{{math|''F''(''a'')}} is the largest element {{mvar|b}} with {{math|''a'' ≤ ''G''(''b'')}}, and 
:{{math|''G''(''b'')}} is the largest element {{mvar|a}} with {{math|''b'' ≤ ''F''(''a'')}}.

The compositions {{math|''GF'' : ''A'' → ''A''}} and {{math|''FG'' : ''B'' → ''B''}} are the associated closure operators; they are monotone idempotent maps with the property {{math|''a'' ≤ ''GF''(''a'')}} for all {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|A}} and {{math|''b'' ≤ ''FG''(''b'')}} for all {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|B}}.

The implications of the two definitions of Galois connections are very similar, since an antitone Galois connection between {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} is just a monotone Galois connection between {{mvar|A}} and the [[duality (order theory)|order dual]] {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;}} of {{mvar|B}}. All of the below statements on Galois connections can thus easily be converted into statements about antitone Galois connections.

== Examples ==

===Monotone Galois connections===

====Power set; implication and conjunction====
For an order theoretic example, let {{mvar|U}} be some [[Set (mathematics)|set]], and let {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} both be the [[power set]] of {{mvar|U}}, ordered by inclusion. Pick a fixed subset {{mvar|L}} of {{mvar|U}}. Then the maps {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|G}}, where {{math|''F''(''M'') {{=}} ''L'' ∩ ''M''}}, and {{math|''G''(''N'') {{=}} ''N'' ∪ (''U''&amp;thinsp;\&amp;thinsp;''L'')}}, form a monotone Galois connection, with {{mvar|F}} being the lower adjoint. A similar Galois connection whose lower adjoint is given by the meet (infimum) operation can be found in any [[Heyting algebra]]. Especially, it is present in any [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], where the two mappings can be described by {{math|''F''(''x'') {{=}} (''a'' ∧ ''x'')}} and {{math|''G''(''y'') {{=}} (''y'' ∨ ¬''a'') {{=}} (''a'' ⇒ ''y'')}}. In logical terms: "implication from {{mvar|a}}" is the upper adjoint of "conjunction with {{mvar|a}}".

====Lattices====
Further interesting examples for Galois connections are described in the article on [[completeness (order theory)|completeness properties]]. Roughly speaking, it turns out that the usual functions ∨ and ∧ are lower and upper adjoints to the diagonal map {{math|''X'' → ''X'' × ''X''}}. The least and greatest elements of a partial order are given by lower and upper adjoints to the unique function {{math|''X'' → {1}.}} Going further, even [[complete lattice]]s can be characterized by the existence of suitable adjoints. These considerations give some impression of the ubiquity of Galois connections in order theory.

====Transitive group actions====
Let {{mvar|G}} act [[Group action#Types of actions|transitively]] on {{mvar|X}} and pick some point {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}}. Consider

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B} = \{B \subseteq X : x \in B; \forall g \in G, gB = B \ \mathrm{or} \ gB \cap B = \emptyset\},&lt;/math&gt;

the set of '''blocks''' containing {{mvar|x}}. Further, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; consist of the subgroups of {{mvar|G}} containing the [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer]] of {{mvar|x}}.

Then, the correspondence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; B \mapsto H_B = \{g \in G : gx \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;
is a monotone, one-to-one Galois connection.&lt;ref&gt;See Alperin, Bell, Groups and Representations (GTM 162), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; As a corollary, one can establish that doubly transitive actions have no blocks other than the trivial ones (singletons or the whole of {{mvar|X}}): this follows from the stabilizers being maximal in {{mvar|G}} in that case. See [[2-transitive group|doubly transitive group]] for further discussion.

====Image and inverse image====
If {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp; : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is a [[function (mathematics)|function]], then for any subset {{mvar|M}} of {{mvar|X}} we can form the image {{math|''F''(''M'') {{=}} &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;(''M'') {{=}} {''f''(''m'') {{!}} ''m'' ∈ ''M''} }} and for any subset {{mvar|N}} of {{mvar|Y}} we can form the inverse image {{math|''G''(''N'') {{=}} &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''N'') {{=}} {''x'' ∈ ''X'' {{!}} &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(''x'') ∈ ''N''}.}} Then {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|G}} form a monotone Galois connection between the power set of {{mvar|X}} and the power set of {{mvar|Y}}, both ordered by inclusion ⊆. There is a further adjoint pair in this situation: for a subset {{mvar|M}} of {{mvar|X}}, define {{math|''H''(''M'') {{=}} {''y'' ∈ ''Y'' {{!}} &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({''y''}) ⊆ ''M''}.}} Then {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|H}} form a monotone Galois connection between the power set of {{mvar|Y}} and the power set of {{mvar|X}}. In the first Galois connection, {{mvar|G}} is the upper adjoint, while in the second Galois connection it serves as the lower adjoint.

In the case of a [[quotient group|quotient map]] between algebraic objects (such as groups), this connection is called the [[lattice theorem]]: subgroups of {{mvar|G}} connect to subgroups of {{math|''G''/''N''}}, and the closure operator on subgroups of {{mvar|G}} is given by {{math|{{overline|''H''}} {{=}} ''HN''}}.

====Span and closure====
Pick some mathematical object {{mvar|X}} that has an underlying set, for instance a [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], [[vector space]], etc. For any subset {{mvar|S}} of {{mvar|X}}, let {{math|''F''(''S'')}} be the smallest subobject of {{mvar|X}} that contains {{mvar|S}}, i.e. the [[subgroup]], [[subring]] or [[linear subspace|subspace]] generated by {{mvar|S}}. For any subobject {{mvar|U}} of {{mvar|X}}, let {{math|''G''(''U'')}} be the underlying set of {{mvar|U}}. (We can even take {{mvar|X}} to be a [[topological space]], let {{math|''F''(''S'')}} the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of {{mvar|S}}, and take as "subobjects of {{mvar|X}}" the closed subsets of {{mvar|X}}.) Now {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|G}} form a monotone Galois connection between subsets of {{mvar|X}} and subobjects of {{mvar|X}}, if both are ordered by inclusion. {{mvar|F}} is the lower adjoint.

====Syntax and semantics====
A very general comment of [[William Lawvere]]&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lawvere]], Adjointness in foundations, Dialectica, 1969, [http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/16/tr16abs.html available here]. The notation is different nowadays; an easier introduction by Peter Smith [http://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/Galois.pdf in these lecture notes], which also attribute the concept to the article cited.&lt;/ref&gt; is that ''syntax and semantics'' are adjoint: take {{mvar|A}} to be the set of all logical theories (axiomatizations), and {{mvar|B}} the power set of the set of all mathematical structures. For a theory {{math|''T'' ∈ ''A''}}, let {{math|''F''(''T'')}} be the set of all structures that satisfy the axioms {{mvar|T}}; for a set of mathematical structures {{mvar|S}}, let {{math|''G''(''S'')}} be the minimum of the axiomatizations which approximate {{mvar|S}}. We can then say that {{math|''F''(''T'')}} is a subset of {{mvar|S}} if and only if {{mvar|T}} logically implies {{math|''G''(''S'')}}: the "semantics functor" {{mvar|F}} and the "syntax functor" {{mvar|G}} form a monotone Galois connection, with semantics being the lower adjoint.

===Antitone galois connections===

====Galois theory====
The motivating example comes from Galois theory: suppose {{math|''L''/''K''}} is a [[field extension]]. Let {{mvar|A}} be the set of all subfields of {{mvar|L}} that contain {{mvar|K}}, ordered by inclusion ⊆. If {{mvar|E}} is  such a subfield, write {{math|Gal(''L''/''E'')}} for the group of field automorphisms of {{mvar|L}} that hold {{mvar|E}} fixed. Let {{mvar|B}} be the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''L''/''K'')}}, ordered by inclusion ⊆. For such a subgroup {{mvar|G}}, define {{math|Fix(''G'')}} to be the field consisting of all elements of {{mvar|L}} that are held fixed by all elements of {{mvar|G}}. Then the maps {{math|''E'' {{mapsto}} Gal(''L''/''E'')}} and {{math|''G'' {{mapsto}} Fix(''G'')}} form an antitone Galois connection.

====Algebraic topology: covering spaces====
Analogously, given a [[path-connected]] [[topological space]] {{mvar|X}}, there is an antitone Galois connection between subgroups of the fundamental group {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')}} and [[path-connected]] covering spaces of {{mvar|X}}. In particular, if {{mvar|X}} is [[semi-locally simply connected]], then for every subgroup {{mvar|G}} of {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')}}, there is a covering space with {{mvar|G}} as its fundamental group.

====Linear algebra: annihilators and orthogonal complements====
Given an [[inner product space]] {{mvar|V}}, we can form the [[orthogonal complement]] {{math|''F''(''X'')}} of any subspace {{mvar|X}} of {{mvar|V}}. This yields an antitone Galois connection between the set of subspaces of {{mvar|V}} and itself, ordered by inclusion; both polarities are equal to {{mvar|F}}.

Given a [[vector space]] {{mvar|V}} and a subset {{mvar|X}} of {{mvar|V}} we can define its annihilator {{math|''F''(''X'')}}, consisting of all elements of the [[dual space]] {{math|''V''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} of {{mvar|V}} that vanish on {{mvar|X}}. Similarly, given a subset {{mvar|Y}} of {{math|''V''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}, we define its annihilator {{math|''G''(''Y'') {{=}} {''x'' ∈ ''V'' {{!}} ''φ''(''x'') {{=}} 0 ∀''φ'' ∈ ''Y''}.}} This gives an antitone Galois connection between the subsets of {{mvar|V}} and the subsets of {{math|''V''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

====Algebraic geometry====
In [[algebraic geometry]], the relation between sets of [[polynomial]]s and their zero sets is an antitone Galois connection.

Fix a [[natural number]] {{mvar|n}} and a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|K}} and let {{mvar|A}} be the set of all subsets of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''K''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']}} ordered by inclusion ⊆, and let {{mvar|B}} be the set of all subsets of {{math|''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} ordered by inclusion ⊆. If {{mvar|S}} is a set of polynomials, define the [[Algebraic geometry#Affine varieties|variety]] of zeros as

:&lt;math&gt;V(S) = \{x \in K^n : f(x) = 0 \mbox{ for all } f \in S\},&lt;/math&gt;

the set of common zeros of the polynomials in {{mvar|S}}. If {{mvar|U}} is a subset of {{math|''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, define {{math|''I''(''U'')}} as an ideal of polynomials vanishing on {{mvar|U}}, that is

:&lt;math&gt;I(U) = \{ f \in K[X_1,\cdots,X_n] : f(x) = 0 \mbox{ for all } x \in U\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then {{mvar|V}} and ''I'' form an antitone Galois connection.

The closure on {{math|''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the closure in the [[Zariski topology]], and if the field {{mvar|K}} is [[Algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], then the closure on the polynomial ring is the [[Radical of an ideal|radical]] of ideal generated by {{mvar|S}}.

More generally, given a [[commutative ring]] {{mvar|R}} (not necessarily a polynomial ring), there is an antitone Galois connection between radical ideals in the ring and subvarieties of the [[Algebraic geometry#Affine varieties|affine variety]] [[Spectrum of a ring|{{math|Spec(''R'')}}]].

More generally, there is an antitone Galois connection between ideals in the ring and [[subscheme]]s of the corresponding [[Algebraic geometry#Affine varieties|affine variety]].

====Connections on power sets arising from binary relations====
Suppose {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are arbitrary sets and a [[binary relation]] {{mvar|R}} over {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} is given. For any subset {{mvar|M}} of {{mvar|X}}, we define {{math|''F''(''M'') {{=}} {''y'' ∈ ''Y'' {{!}} ''mRy'' ∀''m'' ∈ ''M''}.}} Similarly, for any subset {{mvar|N}} of {{mvar|Y}}, define {{math|''G''(''N'') {{=}} {''x'' ∈ ''X'' {{!}} ''xRn'' ∀''n'' ∈ ''N''}.}} Then {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|G}} yield an antitone Galois connection between the power sets of {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}}, both ordered by inclusion ⊆. &lt;ref&gt; Birkhoff, 1st edition (1940): §32, 3rd edition (1967): Ch. V, §7 and §8&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to isomorphism ''all'' antitone Galois connections between power sets arise in this way. This follows from the "Basic Theorem on Concept Lattices" &lt;ref&gt;Ganter, B. and Wille, R. ''Formal Concept Analysis -- Mathematical Foundations'', Springer (1999), {{ISBN|978-3-540-627715}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Theory and applications of Galois connections arising from binary relations are studied in [[formal concept analysis]]. That field uses Galois connections for mathematical data analysis.  Many algorithms for Galois connections can be found in the respective literature, e.g., in &lt;ref&gt; Ganter, B. and Obiedkov, S. ''Conceptual Exploration'', Springer (2016), {{ISBN|978-3-662-49290-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Properties ==
In the following, we consider a (monotone) Galois connection {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; {{=}} (&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; : ''A'' → ''B''}} is the lower adjoint as introduced above. Some helpful and instructive basic properties can be obtained immediately. By the defining property of Galois connections, {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') ≤ &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is equivalent to {{math|''x'' ≤ &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''))}}, for all {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|A}}. By a similar reasoning (or just by applying the [[duality (order theory)|duality principle for order theory]]), one finds that {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'')) ≤ ''y''}}, for all {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|B}}. These properties can be described by saying the composite {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} is ''deflationary'', while {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is ''inflationary'' (or ''extensive'').

Now consider {{math|''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''A''}} such that {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}}, then using the above one obtains {{math|''x'' ≤ &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(''y''))}}. Applying the basic property of Galois connections, one can now conclude that {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') ≤ &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(''y'')}}. But this just shows that {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} preserves the order of any two elements, i.e. it is monotone. Again, a similar reasoning yields monotonicity of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Thus monotonicity does not have to be included in the definition explicitly. However, mentioning monotonicity helps to avoid confusion about the two alternative notions of Galois connections.

Another basic property of Galois connections is the fact that {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''))) {{=}} &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}, for all {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|B}}. Clearly we find that

:{{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''))) ≥ &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}.

because {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is inflationary as shown above. On the other hand, since {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} is deflationary, while {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} is monotonic, one finds that

:{{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''))) ≤ &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}.

This shows the desired equality. Furthermore, we can use this property to conclude that

:{{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')))) {{=}} &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''))}}

and

:{{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')))) {{=}} &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''))}}

i.e., {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} are [[idempotent]].

It can be shown (see Blyth or Erné for proofs) that a function {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is a lower (resp. upper) adjoint if and only if {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is a [[residuated mapping]] (resp. residual mapping). Therefore, the notion of residuated mapping and monotone Galois connection are essentially the same.

== Closure operators and Galois connections ==
The above findings can be summarized as follows: for a Galois connection, the composite {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is monotone (being the composite of monotone functions), inflationary, and idempotent. This states that {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is in fact a [[closure operator]] on {{mvar|A}}. Dually, {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} is monotone, deflationary, and idempotent. Such mappings are sometimes called '''kernel operators'''. In the context of [[frames and locales]], the composite {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is called the '''nucleus''' induced by {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;}}. Nuclei induce frame homomorphisms; a subset of a locale is called a [[sublocale]] if it is given by a nucleus.

Conversely, any closure operator {{mvar|c}} on some poset {{mvar|A}} gives rise to the Galois connection with lower adjoint {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} being just the corestriction of {{mvar|c}} to the image of {{mvar|c}} (i.e. as a surjective mapping the closure system {{math|''c''(''A'')}}). The upper adjoint {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} is then given by the inclusion of {{math|''c''(''A'')}} into {{mvar|A}}, that maps each closed element to itself, considered as an element of {{mvar|A}}. In this way, closure operators and Galois connections are seen to be closely related, each specifying an instance of the other. Similar conclusions hold true for kernel operators.

The above considerations also show that closed elements of {{mvar|A}} (elements {{mvar|x}} with {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')) {{=}} ''x''}}) are mapped to elements within the range of the kernel operator {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and vice versa.

== Existence and uniqueness of Galois connections ==
Another important property of Galois connections is that lower adjoints [[limit preserving (order theory)|preserve]] all [[supremum|suprema]] that exist within their [[function domain|domain]]. Dually, upper adjoints preserve all existing [[infimum|infima]]. From these properties, one can also conclude monotonicity of the adjoints immediately. The [[adjoint functor theorem (order theory)|adjoint functor theorem for order theory]] states that the converse implication is also valid in certain cases: especially, any mapping between [[complete lattice]]s that preserves all suprema is the lower adjoint of a Galois connection.

In this situation, an important feature of Galois connections is that one adjoint uniquely determines the other. Hence one can strengthen the above statement to guarantee that any supremum-preserving map between complete lattices is the lower adjoint of a unique Galois connection. The main property to derive this uniqueness is the following: For every {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|A}}, {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is the least element {{mvar|y}} of {{mvar|B}} such that {{math|''x'' ≤ &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'')}}. Dually, for every {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|B}}, {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'')}} is the greatest {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|A}} such that {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') ≤ ''y''}}. The existence of a certain Galois connection now implies the existence of the respective least or greatest elements, no matter whether the corresponding posets satisfy any [[completeness (order theory)|completeness properties]]. Thus, when one upper adjoint of a Galois connection is given, the other upper adjoint can be defined via this same property.

On the other hand, some monotone function {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;}} is a lower adjoint [[if and only if]] each set of the form {{math|{''x'' ∈ ''A'' {{!}} &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;(''x'') ≤ ''b''},}} for {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|B}}, contains a greatest element. Again, this can be dualized for the upper adjoint.

== Galois connections as morphisms ==
Galois connections also provide an interesting class of mappings between posets which can be used to obtain [[category theory|categories]] of posets. Especially, it is possible to compose Galois connections: given Galois connections {{math|(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;)}} between posets {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} and {{math|(''g''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;)}} between {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|C}}, the composite {{math|(''g''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is also a Galois connection. When considering categories of complete lattices, this can be simplified to considering just mappings preserving all suprema (or, alternatively, infima). Mapping complete lattices to their duals, this categories display auto [[duality (category theory)|duality]], that are quite fundamental for obtaining other duality theorems. More special kinds of morphisms that induce adjoint mappings in the other direction are the morphisms usually considered for [[complete Heyting algebra|frames]] (or locales).

== Connection to category theory ==
Every partially ordered set can be viewed as a [[category theory|category]] in a natural way: there is a unique morphism from ''x'' to ''y'' [[if and only if]] {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}}. A monotone Galois connection is then nothing but a pair of [[adjoint functors]] between two categories that arise from partially ordered sets. In this context, the upper adjoint is the ''right adjoint'' while the lower adjoint is the ''left adjoint''. However, this terminology is avoided for Galois connections, since there was a time when posets were transformed into categories in a [[dual (category theory)|dual]] fashion, i.e. with arrows pointing in the opposite direction. This led to a complementary notation concerning left and right adjoints, which today is ambiguous.

== Applications in the theory of programming ==
Galois connections may be used to describe many forms of abstraction in the theory of [[abstract interpretation]] of [[programming language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick Cousot |author2=Radhia Cousot | chapter=Abstract Interpretation: A Unified Lattice Model for Static Analysis of Programs by Construction or Approximation of Fixpoints| title=Proc. 4th ACM Symp. on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL)|date=Jan 1977| pages=238–252 |url=http://www.di.ens.fr/~cousot/publications.www/CousotCousot-POPL-77-ACM-p238--252-1977.pdf}}&lt;BR&gt;For a counterexample for the false theorem in Sect.7 (p.243 top right), see: {{cite techreport|author1=Jochen Burghardt |author2=Florian Kammüller |author3=Jeff W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="921">'''GapP''' is a [[counting complexity class]], consisting of all of the functions ''f'' such that there exists a polynomial-time [[non-deterministic  Turing machine]] ''M'' where, for any input ''x'', ''f(x)'' is equal to the number of accepting paths of ''M'' minus the number of rejecting paths of ''M''.

HHpred and HHsearch are among the most popular methods for protein structure prediction and the detection of remotely related sequences, each having been cited over 500 times.&lt;ref&gt;Number of results returned from a search on Google Scholar. [https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=(hhpred+OR+HHsearch)+and+protein&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search (Google Scholar search)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Sequence searches are frequently performed by biologists to infer the function of an unknown protein from its sequence. For this purpose, the protein's sequence is compared to the sequences of other proteins in public databases and its function is deduced from those of the most similar sequences. Often, no sequences with annotated functions can be found in such a search. In this case, more sensitive methods are required to identify more remotely related proteins or [[protein family|protein families]]. From these relationships, hypotheses about the protein's functions, [[Protein structure prediction|structure]], and [[Protein domain|domain composition]] can be inferred. HHsearch performs searches with a protein sequence through databases. The HHpred server and the HH-suite software package offer many popular, regularly updated databases, such as the [[Protein Data Bank]], as well as the [[InterPro]], [[Pfam]], [[Clusters of Orthologous Groups|COG]], and [[Structural Classification of Proteins|SCOP]] databases.

HHpred and HHsearch belong to the class of profile-profile comparison tools, which includes the most sensitive sequence search methods to date.&lt;ref name="pmid15531603"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10975570"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaroszewski L, Rychlewski L, Godzik A | title = Improving the quality of twilight-zone alignments | journal = Protein Science | year = 2000 | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 1487–1496 | pmid = 10975570 | doi = 10.1110/ps.9.8.1487 | pmc = 2144727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sadreyev RI, Baker D, Grishin NV | title = Profile–profile comparisons by COMPASS predict intricate homologies between protein families | journal = Protein Science | year = 2003 | volume = 12 | issue = 10 | pages = 2262–2272 | pmid = 14500884 | doi = 10.1110/ps.03197403 | pmc = 2366929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dunbrack RL Jr | title = Sequence comparison and protein structure prediction | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | year = 2006 | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 374–384 | pmid = 16713709 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2006.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They represent both the query sequence and the database sequences by ''sequence profiles'', also called ''[[position-specific scoring matrix|position-specific scoring matrices]]'' (PSSMs). Profiles are calculated from a [[multiple sequence alignment]] of related sequences which are collected, for example, using the [[BLAST|PSI-BLAST]] program or the HHblits program from the [[HH-suite]] package. A profile is a matrix containing for each position in the query sequence the similarity score for the 20 amino acids. These scores are calculated from the frequencies of the amino acids at the corresponding positions in the multiple sequence alignment. Because profiles contain much more information than a single sequence (e.g. the position-specific degree of conservation), profile-profile comparison methods are much more powerful than sequence-sequence comparison methods like [[BLAST]] or profile-sequence comparison methods like PSI-BLAST.&lt;ref name="pmid10975570" /&gt;

HHpred and HHsearch represent query and database proteins by [[hidden Markov model|profile hidden Markov models]] (HMMs), an extension of [[position-specific scoring matrix|sequence profiles]] which also record position-specific amino acid insertion and deletion frequencies. HHsearch searches a database of HMMs with a query HMM. Before starting the search through the actual database of HMMs, HHsearch/HHpred builds a [[multiple sequence alignment]] of related sequences using the HHblits program from the [[HH-suite]] package. From this alignment, a profile HMM is calculated. The databases contain HMMs that are precalculated in the same fashion using PSI-BLAST. The output of HHpred and HHsearch is a ranked list of database matches (including E-values and probabilities for a true relationship) and the pairwise query-database sequence alignments. A search through the PDB database of proteins with solved 3D structure takes a few minutes. If a significant match with a protein of known structure (a "template") is found in the PDB database, HHpred allows the user to build a homology model using the [[MODELLER]] software, starting from the pairwise query-template alignment.

==Applications==
Applications of HHpred and HHsearch include protein structure prediction, complex structure prediction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guerler A, Govindarajoo B, Zhang Y | title = Mapping Monomeric Threading to Protein–Protein Structure Prediction | journal = Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1021/ci300579r| pmc = 4076494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; function prediction, domain prediction, domain boundary prediction, and evolutionary classification of proteins.

==CASP Rankings==

[[Image:BeachBall.jpg|thumb|This [[beach ball]] shows a hosohedron with six [[Spherical lune|lune]] faces, if the white circles on the ends are removed.]]
In [[geometry]], an [[Polygon|''n''-gonal]] '''hosohedron''' is a [[tessellation]] of [[spherical lune|lunes]] on a spherical surface, such that each lune shares the same two [[Antipodal point|polar opposite]] vertices. 

A regular ''n''-gonal hosohedron has [[Schläfli symbol]] {2,&amp;nbsp;''n''}, with each [[spherical lune]] having [[internal angle]] {{sfrac|2{{pi}}|''n''}} [[radian]]s ({{sfrac|360|''n''}} degrees).&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, ''Regular polytopes'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abstract Regular polytopes, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hosohedra as regular polyhedra ==
{{See|List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Spherical_2}}
For a regular polyhedron whose Schläfli symbol is {''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n''}, the number of polygonal faces may be found by:
:&lt;math&gt;N_2=\frac{4n}{2m+2n-mn}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Platonic solid]]s known to antiquity are the only integer solutions for ''m'' ≥ 3 and ''n'' ≥ 3. The restriction ''m'' ≥ 3 enforces that the polygonal faces must have at least three sides.

When considering polyhedra as a [[spherical tiling]], this restriction may be relaxed, since [[digon]]s (2-gons) can be represented as [[spherical lune]]s, having non-zero [[area (geometry)|area]]. Allowing ''m'' = 2 admits a new infinite class of regular polyhedra, which are the hosohedra. On a spherical surface, the polyhedron {2,&amp;nbsp;''n''} is represented as ''n'' abutting lunes, with interior angles of {{sfrac|2{{pi}}|''n''}}. All these lunes share two common vertices.

== Kaleidoscopic symmetry ==
The digonal ([[spherical lune|lune]]) faces of a 2''n''-hosohedron, {2,2''n''}, represents the fundamental domains of [[dihedral symmetry in three dimensions]]: C&lt;sub&gt;''n''v&lt;/sub&gt;, [''n''], (*''nn''), order 2''n''. The reflection domains can be shown as alternately colored lunes as mirror images. Bisecting the lunes into two spherical triangles creates [[Bipyramid|bipyramids]] and define [[dihedral symmetry]] D&lt;sub&gt;''n''h&lt;/sub&gt;, order 4''n''.

== Relationship with the Steinmetz solid ==
The tetragonal hosohedron is topologically equivalent to the [[Steinmetz solid#Bicylinder|bicylinder Steinmetz solid]], the intersection of two cylinders at right-angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=SteinmetzSolid|title=Steinmetz Solid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivative polyhedra ==
The [[dual polyhedron|dual]] of the n-gonal hosohedron {2,&amp;nbsp;''n''} is the ''n''-gonal [[dihedron]], {''n'',&amp;nbsp;2}. The polyhedron {2,2} is self-dual, and is both a hosohedron and a dihedron.  

A hosohedron may be modified in the same manner as the other polyhedra to produce a [[truncated polyhedron|truncated]] variation. The truncated ''n''-gonal hosohedron is the n-gonal [[prism (geometry)|prism]].

== Apeirogonal hosohedron ==
In the limit the hosohedron becomes an [[apeirogonal hosohedron]] as a 2-dimensional tessellation:
:[[File:Apeirogonal hosohedron.png|240px]]

== Hosotopes ==

[[dimension|Multidimensional]] analogues in general are called '''hosotopes'''. A regular hosotope with [[Schläfli symbol]] {2,''p'',...,''q''} has two vertices, each with a [[vertex figure]] {''p'',...,''q''}.

The [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Spherical|two-dimensional hosotope]], {2}, is a [[digon]].

== Etymology ==
The term “hosohedron” was coined by [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H.S.M. Coxeter]], and possibly derives from the Greek ὅσος (''hosos'') “as many”, the idea being that a hosohedron can have “'''as many''' faces as desired”.&lt;ref name="Schwartzman1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Schwartzman|title=The Words of Mathematics: An Etymological Dictionary of Mathematical Terms Used in English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SRw4PevE4zUC&amp;pg=PA109|date=1 January 1994|publisher=MAA|isbn=978-0-88385-511-9|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], a '''hypercube''' is an [[N-dimensional space|''n''-dimensional]] analogue of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] ({{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}) and a [[cube]] ({{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}). It is a [[Closed set|closed]], [[Compact space|compact]], [[Convex polytope|convex]] figure whose 1-[[N-skeleton|skeleton]] consists of groups of opposite [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] [[line segment]]s aligned in each of the space's [[dimension]]s, [[perpendicular]] to each other and of the same length.  A unit hypercube's longest diagonal in ''n'' dimensions is equal to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

An ''n''-dimensional hypercube is also called an '''''n''-cube''' or an '''''n''-dimensional cube'''.  The term "'''measure polytope'''" is also used, notably in the work of [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]] (originally from Elte, 1912),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Elte | first=E. L. | title=The Semiregular Polytopes of the Hyperspaces | publisher=[[University of Groningen]] | location=Netherlands | year = 1912  | chapter=IV, Five dimensional semiregular polytope | url=https://www.amazon.com/Semiregular-Polytopes-Hyperspaces-Emanuel-Lodewijk/dp/141817968X }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has now been superseded.

The hypercube is the special case of a [[hyperrectangle]] (also called an ''n-orthotope'').

A ''unit hypercube'' is a hypercube whose side has length one [[unit (number)|unit]].  Often, the hypercube whose corners (or ''vertices'') are the 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; points in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with each coordinate equal to 0 or 1 is called ''the'' unit hypercube.

==Construction==
[[File:Dimension levels.svg|thumb|350px|A diagram showing how to create a tesseract from a point.]]
[[File:From Point to Tesseract (Looped Version).gif|thumb|An animation showing how to create a tesseract from a point.]]

A hypercube can be defined by increasing the numbers of dimensions of a shape:

:'''0''' – A point is a hypercube of dimension zero.
:'''1''' – If one moves this point one unit length, it will sweep out a line segment, which is a unit hypercube of dimension one.
:'''2''' – If one moves this line segment its length in a [[perpendicular]] direction from itself; it sweeps out a 2-dimensional square.
:'''3''' – If one moves the square one unit length in the direction perpendicular to the plane it lies on, it will generate a 3-dimensional cube.
:'''4''' – If one moves the cube one unit length into the fourth dimension, it generates a 4-dimensional unit hypercube (a unit [[tesseract]]).

This can be generalized to any number of dimensions. This process of sweeping out volumes can be formalized mathematically as a [[Minkowski sum]]: the ''d''-dimensional hypercube is the Minkowski sum of ''d'' mutually perpendicular unit-length line segments, and is therefore an example of a [[zonotope]].

The 1-[[Skeleton (topology)|skeleton]] of a hypercube is a [[hypercube graph]].

==Coordinates==
A unit hypercube of ''n'' dimensions is the [[convex hull]] of the points given by all sign permutations of the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{2}, \cdots, \pm \frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. It has an edge length of 1 and an ''n''-dimensional volume of 1.

An ''n''-dimensional hypercube is also often regarded as the convex hull of all sign permutations of the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\pm 1, \pm 1, \cdots, \pm 1)&lt;/math&gt;. This form is often chosen due to ease of writing out the coordinates. Its edge length is 2, and its ''n''-dimensional volume is 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Elements==
Every ''n''-cube of n &gt; 0 is composed of elements, or ''n''-cubes of a lower dimension, on the (''n''−1)-dimensional surface on the parent hypercube. A side is any element of (''n''−1)-dimension of the parent hypercube. A hypercube of dimension ''n'' has 2''n'' sides (a 1-dimensional line has 2 endpoints; a 2-dimensional square has 4 sides or edges; a 3-dimensional cube has 6 2-dimensional faces; a 4-dimensional tesseract has 8 cells). The number of vertices (points) of a hypercube is &lt;math&gt;2^{n}&lt;/math&gt; (a cube has &lt;math&gt;2^{3}&lt;/math&gt; vertices, for instance).

The number of ''m''-dimensional hypercubes (just referred to as ''m''-cube from here on) on the boundary of an ''n''-cube is

:&lt;math&gt; E_{m,n} = 2^{n-m}{n \choose m} &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, ''Regular polytopes'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; where &lt;math&gt;{n \choose m}=\frac{n!}{m!\,(n-m)!}&lt;/math&gt; and ''n''! denotes the [[factorial]] of ''n''.

For example, the boundary of a 4-cube (n=4) contains 8 cubes (3-cubes), 24 squares (2-cubes), 32 lines (1-cubes) and 16 vertices (0-cubes).

This identity can be proved by combinatorial arguments; each of the &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; vertices defines a vertex in
a ''m''-dimensional boundary. There are &lt;math&gt;{n \choose m}&lt;/math&gt; ways of choosing which lines ("sides") that defines the subspace that the boundary is in. But, each side is counted &lt;math&gt;2^m&lt;/math&gt; times since it has that many vertices, we need to divide by this number.

This identity can also be used to generate the formula for the ''n''-dimensional cube surface area. The surface area of a hypercube is: &lt;math&gt;2ns^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

These numbers can also be generated by the linear [[recurrence relation]]

:&lt;math&gt;E_{m,n} = 2E_{m,n-1} + E_{m-1,n-1} \!&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; with &lt;math&gt;E_{0,0} = 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp;and undefined elements (where &lt;math&gt;n &lt; m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;m &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; ) &lt;math&gt;=0&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, extending a square via its 4 vertices adds one extra line (edge) per vertex, and also adds the final second square, to form a cube, giving &lt;math&gt;E_{1,3} \!&lt;/math&gt; = 12 lines in total.

==Related families of polytopes==
The hypercubes are one of the few families of [[regular polytope]]s that are represented in any number of dimensions.

The '''hypercube (offset)''' family is one of three [[regular polytope]] families, labeled by [[Coxeter]] as ''γ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. The other two are the hypercube dual family, the '''[[cross-polytope]]s''', labeled as ''β&lt;sub&gt;n,&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the '''[[simplex|simplices]]''', labeled as ''α&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. A fourth family, the [[hypercubic honeycomb|infinite tessellations of hypercubes]], he labeled as ''δ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Another related family of semiregular and [[uniform polytope]]s is the '''[[demihypercube]]s''', which are constructed from hypercubes with alternate vertices deleted and [[simplex]] facets added in the gaps, labeled as ''hγ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

''n''-cubes can be combined with their duals (the [[cross-polytope]]s) to form compound polytopes:

*In two dimensions, we obtain the [[octagram]]mic star figure {8/2},
*In three dimensions we obtain the [[compound of cube and octahedron]],
*In four dimensions we obtain the [[compound of tesseract and 16-cell]].

==Relation to ''n''-simplices==
The graph of the ''n''-hypercube's edges is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Hasse diagram]] of the (''n''-1)-[[simplex]]'s [[Convex polytope#The face lattice|face lattice]]. This can be seen by orienting the ''n''-hypercube so that two opposite vertices lie vertically, corresponding to the (''n''-1)-simplex itself and the null polytope, respectively. Each vertex connected to the top vertex then uniquely maps to one of the (''n''-1)-simplex's facets (''n''-2 faces), and each vertex connected to those vertices maps to one of the simplex's ''n''-3 faces, and so forth, and the vertices connected to the bottom vertex map to the simplex's vertices.

This relation may be used to generate the face lattice of an (''n-1'')-simplex efficiently, since face lattice enumeration algorithms applicable to general polytopes are more computationally expensive.

==Generalized hypercubes==
Regular [[Complex polytope#Regular_complex_polytopes|complex polytopes]] can be defined in [[Complex number|complex]] [[Hilbert space]] called ''generalized hypercubes'', &amp;gamma;{{supsub|''p''|''n''}} = &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;{4}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{3}...&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or {{CDD|pnode_1|4|node|3}}..{{CDD|3|node|3|node}}. Real solutions exist with ''p''=2, i.e. &amp;gamma;{{supsub|2|''n''}} = &amp;gamma;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{4}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{3}...&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {4,3,..,3}. For ''p''&gt;2, they exist in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;. The facets are generalized (''n''-1)-cube and the [[vertex figure]] are regular [[simplex]]es.

The [[regular polygon]] perimeter seen in these orthogonal projections is called a [[petrie polygon]]. The generalized squares (n=2) are shown with edges outlined as red and blue alternating color ''p''-edges, while the higher n-cubes are drawn with black outlined ''p''-edges.

The number of ''m''-face elements in a ''p''-generalized ''n''-cube are: &lt;math&gt; p^{n-m}{n \choose m}&lt;/math&gt;. This is ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; vertices and ''pn'' facets.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3157">In [[mathematics]], the '''Jacobi–Anger expansion''' (or '''Jacobi–Anger identity''') is an expansion of exponentials of [[trigonometric function]]s in the basis of their harmonics. It is useful in physics (for example, to [[plane wave expansion|convert]] between [[plane wave]]s and [[cylindrical wave]]s), and in [[signal processing]] (to describe [[frequency modulation|FM]] signals). This identity is named after the 19th-century mathematicians [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]] and [[Carl Theodor Anger]].

The most general identity is given by:&lt;ref name=Colton_Kress_32&gt;Colton &amp; Kress (1998) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cuyt_et_al_344&gt;Cuyt ''et al.'' (2008) p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  e^{i z \cos \theta} \equiv \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} i^n\, J_n(z)\, e^{i n \theta},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_n(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[Bessel function of the first kind]] and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary unit]], &lt;math display="inline"&gt;i^2=-1.&lt;/math&gt; 
Substituting &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\theta-\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, we also get:

:&lt;math&gt;
  e^{i z \sin \theta} \equiv \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}       J_n(z)\, e^{i n \theta}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the relation &lt;math&gt;J_{-n}(z) = (-1)^n\, J_{n}(z),&lt;/math&gt; valid for integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the expansion becomes:&lt;ref name=Colton_Kress_32/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cuyt_et_al_344/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i z \cos \theta} \equiv J_0(z)\, +\, 2\, \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\, i^n\, J_n(z)\, \cos\, (n \theta).&lt;/math&gt;

==Real-valued expressions==
The following real-valued variations are often useful as well:&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz &amp; Stegun (1965) [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_361.htm p. 361, 9.1.42–45]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \cos(z \cos \theta) &amp;\equiv J_0(z)+2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n J_{2n}(z) \cos(2n \theta),
  \\
  \sin(z \cos \theta) &amp;\equiv -2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n J_{2n-1}(z) \cos\left[\left(2n-1\right) \theta\right],
  \\
  \cos(z \sin \theta) &amp;\equiv J_0(z)+2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} J_{2n}(z) \cos(2n \theta),
  \\
  \sin(z \sin \theta) &amp;\equiv 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} J_{2n-1}(z) \sin\left[\left(2n-1\right) \theta\right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Jacques Dixmier''' (born 1924) is a [[French people|French]] [[mathematician]]. He worked on [[operator algebra]]s, especially [[C*-algebra]]s, and wrote several of the standard reference books on them, and introduced the [[Dixmier trace]] and the [[Dixmier mapping]]. 

==Biography==
Dixmier received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1949 from the [[University of Paris]], and his students include [[Alain Connes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=34272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 upon the initiative of [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Pierre Samuel]], Dixmier became a member of [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], in which he made essential contributions to the Bourbaki volume on [[Lie algebra]]s.&lt;ref name='interview'&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Newsletter of the EMS|date=June 2009|title=Interview with Jacques Dixmier|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; After retiring as professor emeritus from the University of Paris VI, he spent five years at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]].

Often there is made the erroneous claim that Dixmier originated the name  ''[[von Neumann algebra]]'' for the operator algebras introduced by [[John von Neumann]], but Dixmier said in an interview that the name originated from a proposal by [[Jean Dieudonné]].&lt;ref name='interview'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Dixmier was an [[invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1966 at [[Moscow]] with talk ''Espace dual d'une algèbre, ou d'un groupe localement compact'' and again in 1978 at Helsinki with talk ''Algèbres enveloppantes''.

After leaving West Point in 1971 in protest of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Gerald_McNerney Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917043822/http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Gerald_McNerney |date=2011-09-17 }}, opencongress.org; accessed November 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; he enrolled at the [[University of New Mexico]] in Albuquerque, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees and, in 1981, a Ph.D. in Mathematics, with a doctoral dissertation in differential geometry focusing on a generalization of the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=102206|title=Mathematics Genealogy Project|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McNerney served several years as a contractor to [[Sandia National Laboratories]] at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] on national security programs. In 1985, he accepted a senior engineering position with U.S. Windpower (Kenetech). In 1994, he began working as an energy consultant for [[Pacific Gas and Electric|PG&amp;E]], FloWind, The Electric Power Research Institute, and other utility companies. Before being elected to Congress, Jerry served as the [[CEO]] of a 2004 start-up company manufacturing [[wind turbine]]s, named HAWT Power (Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine Power). A 1992 article that he co-authored in an IEEE journal is a good example of his writings during this period.&lt;ref&gt;G. McNerney and R. Richardson, "The Statistical Smoothing of Power Delivered to Utilities by Multiple Wind Turbines", IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion 7:4 (Dec. 1992), pp. 644–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
;2004
McNerney first ran for Congress against [[Richard Pombo]] in California's 11th congressional district in the [[U.S. House elections, 2004|2004 House elections]]. He entered the race two weeks before the primary election as a write-in candidate. He qualified to be a [[write-in candidate]] for the March 2004 primary by one signature. Having no primary opponent, he won the primary and qualified for the November general election ballot as the Democratic nominee. He lost the general election, 61%-39%. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

;2006
{{Main|California 11th congressional district election, 2006}}

For his first three terms, McNerney represented a district that encompassed eastern [[Alameda County]], most of San Joaquin County and a small portion of Santa Clara County.  After redistricting, his district was renumbered as the 9th District.  It lost its portion of Alameda County, including McNerney's home in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], while picking up part of Sacramento County.  After the new map was announced, McNerney announced he would move to San Joaquin County in the new 9th. Although the new district is somewhat more Democratic than its predecessor, it is influenced by the Central Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garofoli|first=Joe|title=Jerry McNerney looks at new political map, moves to San Joaquin County|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=94178|accessdate=25 August 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually bought a home in Stockton.

;Veterans
In 2010, President Obama signed into law [http://www.ibabuzz.com/politics/2010/05/05/president-signs-mcnerneys-veterans-bill a bill written by McNerney] which improves care of returning service members with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) by establishing an evaluation panel to assess the Veteran's Administration treatments for TBI and recommend improvements. He also wrote a bill in 2013 that [http://cvbj.biz/2013/10/11/mcnerney-sponsors-bill-help-process-veterans-claims allowed veterans to keep receiving their benefits during the government shutdown.]

McNerney was one of the first lawmakers to call for the resignation of VA Secretary [[Eric Shinseki]] following revelations in the news media about delays in care at VA health care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastcountytoday.tumblr.com/post/87171814135/congressman-jerry-mcnerney-calls-for-resignation-of-va McNerney calls for resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki], eastcountytoday.tumblr.com; accessed November 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

McNerney co-sponsored the bill [[To require the Secretary of Energy to prepare a report on the impact of thermal insulation on both energy and water use for potable hot water (H.R. 4801; 113th Congress)]], would require the [[United States Secretary of Energy]] to prepare a report on the effects that [[thermal insulation]] has on both energy consumption and systems for providing [[potable water]] in [[:Category:Buildings of the United States government|federal buildings]].&lt;ref name=cbo4801&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 4801|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/45466|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNerney said that "it is important for us to look for ways to save taxpayer money and ensure the federal government is doing its part to preserve our natural resources."&lt;ref name=LodiNewsSentinel&gt;{{cite news|title=House committee approves Rep.

'''John Willard Milnor''' (born February 20, 1931) is an American [[mathematician]] known for his work in [[differential topology]], [[K-theory]] and [[dynamical systems]]. Milnor is a distinguished professor at [[Stony Brook University]] and one of the four mathematicians to have won the [[Fields Medal]], the [[Wolf Prize]], and the [[Abel Prize]] (along with [[Pierre Deligne]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], and [[John G. Thompson]]).

==Early life and career==
Milnor was born on February 20, 1931 in [[Orange, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://library.ias.edu/files/pdfs/hs/cos.pdf#page=35 ''A COMMUNITY OF SCHOLARS: The Institute for Advanced Study Faculty and Members 1930–1980''], p.&amp;nbsp;35. [[Institute for Advanced Study]], 1980. Accessed November 24, 2015. "Milnor, John Willard M, Topology Born 1931 Orange, NJ."&lt;/ref&gt; His father was J. Willard Milnor and his mother was Emily Cox Milnor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Helge Holden|author2=Ragni Piene|title=The Abel Prize 2008–2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tEprnQEACAAJ|date=3 February 2014|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-39448-5|pages=353–360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen G. Debus|title=World Who's who in Science: A Biographical Dictionary of Notable Scientists from Antiquity to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZNNAQAAIAAJ|year=1968|publisher=Marquis-Who's Who|page=1187}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an undergraduate at [[Princeton University]] he was named a [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition|Putnam Fellow]] in 1949 and 1950 and also proved the [[Fary–Milnor theorem]]. He continued on to graduate school at Princeton under the direction of [[Ralph Fox]] and submitted his dissertation, entitled "[[Regular isotopy|Isotopy]] of [[link (knot theory)|Link]]s", which concerned [[link group]]s (a generalization of the classical knot group) and their associated link structure, in 1954. Upon completing his doctorate he went on to work at Princeton. He was a professor at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] from 1970 to 1990.

His students have included [[Tadatoshi Akiba]], [[Jon Folkman]], [[John Mather (mathematician)|John Mather]], [[Laurent C. Siebenmann]], and [[Michael Spivak]]. His wife, [[Dusa McDuff]], is a professor of mathematics at [[Barnard College]].

==Research==
One of his published works is his proof in 1956 of the existence of [[Seven-dimensional space|7-dimensional]] [[Hypersphere|spheres]] with nonstandard differential structure. Later, with [[Michel Kervaire]], he showed that the 7-sphere has 15 [[differentiable structure]]s (28 if one considers orientation).&lt;br/&gt;An ''n''-sphere with nonstandard differential structure is called an [[exotic sphere]], a term coined by Milnor. [[Egbert Brieskorn]] found simple algebraic equations for 28 complex hypersurfaces in complex 5-space such that their intersection with a small sphere of dimension 9 around a [[Singular point of a curve|singular point]] is diffeomorphic to these exotic spheres. Subsequently Milnor worked on the [[topology]] of isolated [[Singular point of a curve|singular points]] of complex hypersurfaces in general, developing the theory of the [[Milnor fibration]] whose fiber has the [[homotopy]] type of a bouquet of μ spheres where μ is known as the [[Milnor number]]. Milnor's 1968 book on his theory inspired the growth of a huge and rich research area which continues to mature to this day.

In 1961 Milnor disproved the [[Hauptvermutung]] by illustrating two [[simplicial complex]]es which are [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] but [[Combinatorial topology|combinatorially]] distinct.

In 1984 Milnor introduced a definition of [[attractor]] [https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1103942677]. The objects generalize standard attractors, include so-called [[unstable attractor]]s and are now known as [[Milnor attractor]]s.

Milnor's current interest is dynamics, especially holomorphic dynamics. His work in dynamics is summarized by Peter Makienko in his review of ''Topological Methods in Modern Mathematics'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is evident now that low-dimensional dynamics, to a large extent initiated by Milnor's work, is a fundamental part of general dynamical systems theory. Milnor cast his eye on dynamical systems theory in the mid-1970s. By that time the Smale program in dynamics had been completed. Milnor's approach was to start over from the very beginning, looking at the simplest nontrivial families of maps. The first choice, one-dimensional dynamics, became the subject of his joint paper with [[William Thurston|Thurston]]. Even the case of a unimodal map, that is, one with a single critical point, turns out to be extremely rich. This work may be compared with [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré's]] work on [[Diffeomorphism#Topology|circle diffeomorphisms]], which 100 years before had inaugurated the qualitative theory of dynamical systems. Milnor's work has opened several new directions in this field, and has given us many basic concepts, challenging problems and nice theorems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyubich|first=Mikhail|title=Holomorphic Dynamics and Renormalization: A Volume in Honour of John Milnor's 75th Birthday|year=1993|location=Houston, Texas|pages=85–92|authorlink=Milnor's Program in Dynamics|editor=Michael Yampolsky|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was an editor of the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' for a number of years after 1962. He has written a number of books.

==Awards and honors==
In 1962 Milnor was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] for his work in differential topology. He later went on to win the [[National Medal of Science]] (1967), the [[Lester R. Ford Award]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Milnor, John|title=A problem in cartography|journal=Amer. Math.

Milnor was awarded the 2011 [[Abel Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abelprisen.no/en/ |title=The Abel Prize awarded to John Milnor, Stony Brook University, NY |author=Abelprisen (Abel Prize) website |accessdate=March 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429100636/http://www.abelprisen.no/en/ |archivedate=April 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for his "pioneering discoveries in topology, geometry and algebra."&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramachandran|first=R.|title=Abel Prize awarded to John Willard Milnor|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/article1565424.ece|accessdate=24 March 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting to the award, Milnor told the ''[[New Scientist]]'' "It feels very good," adding that "[o]ne is always surprised by a call at 6 o'clock in the morning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aron|first=Jacob|title=Exotic sphere discoverer wins mathematical 'Nobel'|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20281-exotic-sphere-discoverer-wins-mathematical-nobel.html|accessdate=24 March 2011|newspaper=New Scientist|date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013 he became a [[fellow]] of the [[American Mathematical Society]], for "contributions to differential topology, geometric topology, algebraic topology, algebra, and dynamical systems".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/ams-fellows/new-fellows 2014 Class of the Fellows of the AMS], [[American Mathematical Society]], retrieved 2013-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topology]], a '''Jordan curve''', sometimes called a ''plane simple closed curve'', is a non-self-intersecting [[loop (topology)|continuous loop]] in the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Q9mbXCQRyoC&amp;pg=PA7|title=Depth, Crossings and Conflicts in Discrete Geometry|last=Sulovský|first=Marek|date=2012|publisher=Logos Verlag Berlin GmbH|isbn=9783832531195|page=7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Jordan curve theorem''' asserts that every Jordan curve divides the plane into an "interior" region bounded by the curve and an "exterior" region containing all of the nearby and far away exterior points, so that every [[path (topology)|continuous path]] connecting a point of one region to a point of the other intersects with that loop somewhere. While the statement of this [[theorem]] seems to be intuitively obvious, it takes some ingenuity to prove it by elementary means. More transparent proofs rely on the mathematical machinery of [[algebraic topology]], and these lead to generalizations to higher-dimensional spaces.

The Jordan curve theorem is named after the [[mathematician]] [[Camille Jordan]] (1838–1922), who found its first proof. For decades, mathematicians generally thought that this proof was flawed and that the first rigorous proof was carried out by [[Oswald Veblen]]. However, this notion has been challenged by [[Thomas Callister Hales|Thomas C. Hales]] and others.

== Definitions and the statement of the Jordan theorem ==

A ''Jordan curve'' or a ''simple closed curve'' in the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] ''C'' of an [[injective]] [[continuous map]] of a [[circle]] into the plane, ''φ'': ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  A '''Jordan arc''' in the plane is the image of an injective continuous map of a closed interval into the plane.

Alternatively, a Jordan curve is the image of a continuous map ''φ'': [0,1] → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''φ''(0) = ''φ''(1) and the restriction of ''φ'' to [0,1) is injective. The first two conditions say that ''C'' is a continuous loop, whereas the last condition stipulates that ''C'' has no self-intersection points.

With these definitions, the Jordan curve theorem can be stated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let ''C'' be a Jordan curve in the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then its [[complement (set theory)|complement]], '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''C'', consists of exactly two [[connected component (topology)|connected component]]s. One of these components is [[bounded set|bounded]] (the '''interior''') and the other is unbounded (the '''exterior'''), and the curve ''C'' is the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of each component.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, the complement of a Jordan arc in the plane is connected.

== Proof and generalizations ==

The Jordan curve theorem was independently generalized to higher dimensions by [[H. Lebesgue]] and [[L.E.J. Brouwer]] in 1911, resulting in the '''Jordan–Brouwer separation theorem'''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let ''X'' be a ''[[topological sphere]]'' in the (''n''+1)-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; (''n'' &gt; 0), i.e. the image of an injective continuous mapping of the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] ''S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' into '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then the complement ''Y'' of ''X'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; consists of exactly two connected components.  One of these components is bounded (the interior) and the other is unbounded (the exterior).  The set ''X'' is their common boundary.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The proof uses [[homology theory]]. It is first established that, more generally, if ''X'' is homeomorphic to the ''k''-sphere, then the [[reduced homology|reduced integral homology]] groups of ''Y'' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; \ ''X'' are as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}_{q}(Y)= \begin{cases}\mathbb{Z},\quad q=n-k\text{ or }n \\ 0,\quad \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This is proved by induction in ''k'' using the [[Mayer–Vietoris sequence]]. When ''n'' = ''k'', the zeroth reduced homology of ''Y'' has rank 1, which means that ''Y'' has 2 connected components (which are, moreover, [[path connected]]), and with a bit of extra work, one shows that their common boundary is ''X''. A further generalization was found by [[James Waddell Alexander II|J. W. Alexander]], who established the [[Alexander duality]] between the reduced homology of a [[compact space|compact]] subset ''X'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; and the reduced cohomology of its complement. If ''X'' is an ''n''-dimensional compact connected submanifold of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; (or '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;) without boundary, its complement has 2 connected components.

There is a strengthening of the Jordan curve theorem, called the [[Jordan–Schönflies theorem]], which states that the interior and the exterior planar regions determined by a Jordan curve in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are [[homeomorphic]] to the interior and exterior of the [[unit disk]]. In particular, for any point ''P'' in the interior region and a point ''A'' on the Jordan curve, there exists a Jordan arc connecting ''P'' with ''A'' and, with the exception of the endpoint ''A'', completely lying in the interior region. An alternative and equivalent formulation of the Jordan–Schönflies theorem asserts that any Jordan curve ''&amp;phi;'': ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is viewed as the [[unit circle]] in the plane, can be extended to a homeomorphism ''&amp;psi;'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the plane. Unlike Lebesgues' and Brouwer's generalization of the Jordan curve theorem, this statement becomes ''false'' in higher dimensions: while the exterior of the unit ball in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is [[simply connected]], because it [[deformation retract|retracts]] onto the unit sphere, the [[Alexander horned sphere]] is a subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; homeomorphic to a [[sphere]], but so twisted in space that the unbounded component of its complement in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is not simply connected, and hence not homeomorphic to the exterior of the unit ball.

== History and further proofs ==

The statement of the Jordan curve theorem may seem obvious at first, but it is a rather difficult theorem to prove. [[Bernard Bolzano]] was the first to formulate a precise conjecture, observing that it was not a self-evident statement, but that it required a proof. It is easy to establish this result for [[polygon]]s, but the problem came in generalizing it to all kinds of badly behaved curves, which include [[nowhere differentiable]] curves, such as the [[Koch snowflake]] and other [[fractal curve]]s, or even [[Osgood curve|a Jordan curve of positive area]] constructed by {{harvtxt|Osgood|1903}}.

The first proof of this theorem was given by [[Camille Jordan]] in his lectures on [[real analysis]], and was published in his book ''Cours d'analyse de l'École Polytechnique''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|authorlink=Camille Jordan|first=Camille|last= Jordan|year=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some controversy about whether Jordan's proof was complete: the majority of commenters on it have claimed that the first complete proof was given later by [[Oswald Veblen]], who said the following about Jordan's proof:

:His proof, however, is unsatisfactory to many mathematicians. It assumes the theorem without proof in the important special case of a simple polygon, and of the argument from that point on, one must admit at least that all details are not given.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|authorlink=Oswald Veblen|first=Oswald |last=Veblen|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Thomas Callister Hales|Thomas C. Hales]] wrote:

:Nearly every modern citation that I have found agrees that the first correct proof is due to Veblen... In view of the heavy criticism of Jordan’s proof, I was surprised when I sat down to read his proof to find nothing objectionable about it. Since then, I have contacted a number of the authors who have criticized Jordan, and each case the author has admitted to having no direct knowledge of an error in Jordan’s proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hales|2007b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hales also pointed out that the special case of simple polygons is not only an easy exercise, but was not really used by Jordan anyway, and quoted Michael Reeken as saying:

:Jordan’s proof is essentially correct... Jordan’s proof does not present the details in a satisfactory way. But the idea is right, and with some polishing the proof would be impeccable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hales|2007b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, Jordan's proof and another early proof by [[de la Vallée Poussin]] had already been critically analyzed and completed by Schoenflies (1924).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Schoenflies |authorlink=Arthur Moritz Schoenflies |title=Bemerkungen zu den Beweisen von C. Jordan und Ch. J. de la Vallée Poussin |journal=Jahresber. Deutsch. Math.-Verein |volume=33 |year=1924 |pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the importance of the Jordan curve theorem in [[low-dimensional topology]] and [[complex analysis]], it received much attention from prominent mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century. Various proofs of the theorem and its generalizations were constructed by [[James Waddell Alexander II|J. W. Alexander]], [[Louis Antoine]], [[Ludwig Bieberbach|Bieberbach]], [[Luitzen Brouwer]], [[Denjoy]], [[Hartogs]], [[Béla Kerékjártó]], [[Alfred Pringsheim]], and [[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]].

New elementary proofs of the Jordan curve theorem, as well as simplifications of the earlier proofs, continue to be carried out.

* Elementary proofs were presented by {{harvtxt|Filippov|1950}} and {{harvtxt|Tverberg|1980}}.
* A proof using [[non-standard analysis]] by {{harvtxt|Narens|1971}}.
* A proof using constructive mathematics by  {{harvs | txt|last1=Berg | first1=Gordon O. | last2=Julian | first2=W. | last3=Mines | first3=R. | last4=Richman | first4=Fred | title=The constructive Jordan curve theorem | mr=0410701 | year=1975 | journal=[[Rocky Mountain Journal of Mathematics]] | issn=0035-7596 | volume=5 | pages=225–236}}.
* A proof using the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]] by {{harvtxt|Maehara|1984}}.
* A proof using [[planar graph|non-planarity]] of the [[complete bipartite graph]] K&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; was given by {{harvtxt| Thomassen| 1992}}.

The first [[formal proof]] of the Jordan curve theorem was created by {{harvtxt|Hales|2007a}} in the [[HOL Light]] system, in January 2005, and contained about 60,000 lines. Another rigorous 6,500-line formal proof was produced in 2005 by an international team of mathematicians using the [[Mizar system]]. Both the Mizar and the HOL Light proof rely on libraries of previously proved theorems, so these two sizes are not comparable. {{harvs|txt | last1=Sakamoto | first1=Nobuyuki | last2=Yokoyama | first2=Keita | title=The Jordan curve theorem and the Schönflies theorem in weak second-order arithmetic | doi=10.1007/s00153-007-0050-6 | mr=2321588 | year=2007 | journal=Archive for Mathematical Logic | issn=0933-5846 | volume=46 | issue=5 | pages=465–480}} showed that the Jordan curve theorem is equivalent in proof-theoretic strength to the [[weak König's lemma]].

The [[low-pass filter]] associated to Legendre [[multiresolution analysis]] is a [[finite impulse response]] (FIR) filter. 

Wavelets associated to FIR filters are commonly preferred in most applications.&lt;ref name=Colomer/&gt; An extra appealing feature is that the Legendre filters are ''linear phase'' FIR (i.e. multiresolution analysis associated with [[linear phase]] filters). These wavelets have been implemented on [[MATLAB]] (wavelet toolbox). Although being compactly supported wavelet, legdN are not orthogonal (but for ''N'' = 1).&lt;ref&gt;Herley and Vetterli&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legendre multiresolution filters  ==
Associated Legendre polynomials are the colatitudinal part of the spherical harmonics which are common to all separations of Laplace's equation in spherical polar coordinates.&lt;ref name=Gradsh/&gt;  The radial part of the solution varies from one potential to another, but the harmonics are always the same and are a consequence of spherical symmetry. Spherical harmonics &lt;math&gt;P_n(z)&lt;/math&gt; are solutions of the Legendre &lt;math&gt;2^{nd}&lt;/math&gt;-order differential equation, ''n'' integer:

: &lt;math&gt;\left (1-z^2 \right ) \frac {d^2y} {dz^2} - 2z \frac {dy} {dz} + n(n+1)y=0.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P_n(\cos(\theta))&lt;/math&gt; polynomials can be used to define the smoothing filter &lt;math&gt;H(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of a multiresolution analysis (MRA).&lt;ref name=Mallat&gt;Mallat&lt;/ref&gt; Since the appropriate boundary conditions for an MRA are &lt;math&gt;|H(0)|=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|H(\pi)|=0&lt;/math&gt;, the smoothing filter of an MRA can be defined so that the magnitude of the low-pass &lt;math&gt;|H(\omega)|&lt;/math&gt; can be associated to Legendre polynomials according to: &lt;math&gt;\nu=2n+1.&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;|H_{\nu}(\omega)|= \left | \frac {P_{\nu} \left ( \cos \left ( \frac{\omega}{2} \right ) \right ) } {P_{\nu} \cos (0)} \right |&lt;/math&gt;

Illustrative examples of filter transfer functions for a Legendre MRA are shown in figure 1, for &lt;math&gt;\nu=1,3,5.&lt;/math&gt; A low-pass behaviour is exhibited for the filter ''H'', as expected. The number of zeroes within &lt;math&gt;- \pi &lt; \omega &lt; \pi&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the degree of the Legendre polynomial. Therefore, the [[roll-off]] of side-lobes with frequency is easily controlled by the parameter &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Legendre MRA filter.svg|thumb|right|400px|'''Figure 1 - Magnitude of the transfer function for Legendre multiresolution smoothing filters. Filter &lt;math&gt;|H_{\nu} (\omega)|&lt;/math&gt; for orders 1, 3, and 5.''']] 

The low-pass filter transfer function is given by

: &lt;math&gt;H_{\nu} (\omega)=-e^{-j \nu \frac {\omega - \pi} {2}} P_{\nu}  \left ( \cos \left ( \tfrac{\omega}{2} \right ) \right )&lt;/math&gt;

The transfer function of the high-pass analysing filter &lt;math&gt;G_{\nu} (\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is chosen according to [[Quadrature mirror filter]] condition,&lt;ref name=Mallat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vetterli and Herley&lt;/ref&gt; yielding:

: &lt;math&gt;H_{\nu} (\omega)=-e^{-j {(\nu-2)} \frac {\omega} {2}} P_{\nu} \left ( \sin \left ( \tfrac{\omega}{2} \right ) \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed, &lt;math&gt;|G_{\nu}(0)|=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|G_{\nu}( \pi)|=1&lt;/math&gt;, as expected.

== Legendre multiresolution filter coefficients  ==

A suitable phase assignment is done so as to properly adjust the transfer function &lt;math&gt;H_{\nu} (\omega)&lt;/math&gt; to the form

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\nu} (\omega)= \frac {1} {\sqrt {2}} \sum_{k \in Z} h_k^{\nu} e^{-j \omega k}&lt;/math&gt;

The filter coefficients &lt;math&gt;\{ h_k \}_{k \in \Z}&lt;/math&gt; are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;h_k^{\nu}= - \frac {\sqrt {2}} {2^{2 \nu}} \binom{2k}{k} \binom{2 \nu -2k}{\nu -k}&lt;/math&gt;

from which the symmetry:

== MATLAB implementation of Legendre wavelets ==

Legendre wavelets can be easily loaded into the [[MATLAB]] wavelet toolbox—The m-files to allow the computation of Legendre wavelet transform, details and filter are (freeware) available. The finite support width Legendre family is denoted by legd (short name). Wavelets: 'legdN'. The parameter ''N'' in the legdN family is found according to &lt;math&gt;2N = \nu+1&lt;/math&gt; (length of the MRA filters). 

Legendre wavelets can be derived from the low-pass reconstruction filter by an iterative procedure (the [[cascade algorithm]]). The wavelet has compact support and finite impulse response AMR filters (FIR) are used (table 1). The first wavelet of the Legendre's family is exactly the well-known [[Haar wavelet]]. Figure 2 shows an emerging pattern that progressively looks like the wavelet's shape. 

[[Image:Figura legd2.jpg|thumb|none|500px|'''Figure 2 - Shape of Legendre Wavelets of degree &lt;math&gt;\nu=3&lt;/math&gt; (legd2) derived after 4 and 8 iteration of the cascade algorithm, respectively. Shape of Legendre Wavelets of degree &lt;math&gt;\nu=5&lt;/math&gt; (legd3) derived by the cascade algorithm after 4 and 8 iterations of the cascade algorithm, respectively.''']] 

The Legendre wavelet shape can be visualised using the wavemenu command of MATLAB. Figure 3 shows legd8 wavelet displayed using MATLAB&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;. Legendre Polynomials are also associated with windows families.&lt;ref&gt;Jaskula&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Figura legd3.jpg|thumb|none|300px|''' Figure 3 - legd8 wavelet display over MATLAB&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; using the wavemenu command. ''']]

== Legendre wavelet packets ==

[[Wavelet packets]] (WP) systems derived from Legendre wavelets can also be easily accomplished. Figure 5 illustrates the WP functions derived from legd2.

'''Mary Bradburn''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|FRAS}} (1918–2000){{r|mcnally|hebborn}} was a British [[mathematics education|mathematics educator]] who became president of the [[Mathematical Association]] for the 1994–1995 term.{{r|pres|mcnally}}

==Education and career==
Bradborn was born on 17 March 1918 in [[Normanby, Redcar and Cleveland|Normanby]] in [[North Yorkshire]], the daughter of a marine engineer and a Scotswoman.{{r|hebborn|tes}} She attended a school that didn't approve of girls studying mathematics, but allowed her to progress through the mathematics curriculum at her own rate, several years ahead of the other students.{{r|tes}}

She earned a state scholarship, but at 17, she was below the required age for Oxford and Cambridge, so she ended up going to [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway College]].{{r|hebborn|tes}} She was a student there beginning in 1935 and, despite multiple extracurricular activities, earned first class honours in mathematics in 1938, and completed a master's degree there in 1940.{{r|hebborn}} 

With another scholarship from the [[University of London]], she went to the [[University of Edinburgh]] for graduate study with [[Max Born]], beginning in 1941; her dissertation was ''The Statistical Thermodynamics of Crystal Lattices''.{{r|hebborn}}
She taught briefly at Edinburgh and the [[University of Dundee]] before
returning to Royal Holloway as an instructor in 1945. She remained at Royal Holloway through its 1965 transition from a women's college to a coeducational one (a change that she supported), until her retirement in 1980.{{r|hebborn|tes}}

==Recognition and legacy==
She became a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1955.{{r|mcnally}}
The mathematics department of Royal Holloway offers an annual prize to undergraduates, the Mary Bradburn Prize, named in her memory.{{r|prizes}}
The [[British Federation of Women Graduates]] also offers a Mary Bradburn Prize,
from a bequest left by Bradburn.{{r|bfwg}}

The '''Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM)''' is a multi-day [[mathematical modelling competition]] held annually in USA, during the first or second weekend in February, since 1985 by [[COMAP]] and sponsored by [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]], the [[NSA]], and [[INFORMS]].  It is distinguished from other major mathematical competitions such as [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition|Putnam]] by its strong focus on research, originality, teamwork, communication and justification of results. It runs concurrently with the [[Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling]] (ICM).

== Problems ==
At the beginning of the contest, teams have a choice between two problems. Problem A involves a system that requires the use of continuous mathematics, and thus often involves concepts from geometry, physics, or engineering.  Problem B involves a system that requires the use of [[discrete mathematics]]. In 2016, a "data insights" problem was added, where teams are given access to database files and tasked with using them to answer a question.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/flyer/MCM-Problem-C-Overview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was designated as Problem C, though previously, Problem C referred to an ICM problem. These problems tend to be open-ended, and are drawn from all fields of science, business, and public policy. Past problems include
* Estimate the global effects of a large asteroid impacting [[Antarctica]] (1999 A)
* Study the hunting strategies of velociraptor dinosaurs based on fossil data (1997 A)
* Develop a more efficient method of boarding passengers onto large commercial jets (2007 B)
Teams have 96 hours to research and submit their solutions in the form of a research paper. During this time, they may consult any available references, but may not discuss their problem with anyone outside their teams. Several guides containing advice and recommendations for teams and/or advisors have been published online or in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carroll.edu/~kcline/mcm.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202193832/http://www.carroll.edu/~kcline/mcm.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://amath.colorado.edu/uploads/event_docs/mcm_guide.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carroll.edu/~kcline/FOCUSMCMICM.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828204406/http://www.carroll.edu/~kcline/FOCUSMCMICM.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }} Published in MAA FOCUS vol 26 #6, August/September 2006, pp.22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participation and awards ==
Thousands of international teams of three undergraduates compete to produce original mathematical papers in response to one of two modeling problems. Initially, participation was largely from the United States, however in recent years international participation has grown significantly, particularly from the People's Republic of China, so that in 2007 teams from the United States comprised only 24% of total participation. In 2014, the percentage of teams from the People's Republic of China reached a record high of 92.9%.

After the competition, all papers are judged and placed into the following categories:
* Unsuccessful Participant
* Successful Participant (approximately 40% of teams)
* Honorable Mention (approximately 25% of teams)
* Meritorious Winner (usually 10 to 15% of teams)
* Finalist (approximately 1% of teams)
* Outstanding Winner (less than .5% of teams)

Until 2009, Outstanding Winner papers were published in The UMAP Journal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4773">The '''modified internal rate of return''' ('''MIRR''') is a [[finance|financial]] measure of an [[investment]]'s attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, S. A. Y., "The modified internal rate of return and investment criterion," ''The Engineering Economist'' 21(4), 1976, 237-247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beaves, R. G., "Net present value and the rate of return: Implicit and explicit reinvestment assumptions," ''The Engineering Economist'' 33, 1988, 275-302.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in [[capital budgeting]] to rank alternative investments of equal size. As the name implies, MIRR is a modification of the [[internal rate of return]] (IRR) and as such aims to resolve some problems with the IRR.

==Problems with the IRR==
While there are several [[Internal rate of return#Problems with using internal rate of return|problems with the IRR]], MIRR resolves two of them.

Firstly, IRR is sometimes misapplied, under an assumption that interim positive cash flows are reinvested at the same rate of return as that of the project that generated them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3304945 Internal Rate of Return: A Cautionary Tale]&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually an unrealistic scenario and a more likely situation is that the funds will be reinvested at a rate closer to the firm's cost of capital. The IRR therefore often gives an unduly optimistic picture of the projects under study. Generally for comparing projects more fairly, the [[weighted average cost of capital]] should be used for reinvesting the interim cash flows.

Secondly, more than one IRR can be found for projects with alternating positive and negative cash flows, which leads to confusion and ambiguity. MIRR finds only one value.

==Calculation of the MIRR==
MIRR is calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{MIRR}=\sqrt[n]{\frac{FV(\text{positive cash flows, reinvestment rate})}{-PV(\text{negative cash flows, finance rate})}}-1&lt;/math&gt;, 

where ''n'' is the number of equal periods at the end of which the cash flows occur (not the number of cash flows), ''PV'' is [[present value]] (at the beginning of the first period), ''FV'' is [[future value]] (at the end of the last period).

The formula adds up the negative cash flows after discounting them to time zero using the external cost of capital, adds up the positive cash flows including the proceeds of reinvestment at the external reinvestment rate to the final period, and then works out what rate of return would cause the magnitude of the discounted negative cash flows at time zero to be equivalent to the future value of the positive cash flows at the final time period.

[[Spreadsheet|Spreadsheet applications]], such as [[Microsoft Excel]], have inbuilt functions to calculate the MIRR. In Microsoft Excel this function is "=MIRR(...)".

===Example===
If an investment project is described by the sequence of cash flows:

{| class="wikitable" align="left"
|-
! Year
! Cash flow
|- align="center"
| 0
| -1000
|- align="center"
| 1
| -4000
|- align="center"
| 2
| 5000
|- align="center"
| 3
| 2000
|}
{{-}}

then the IRR &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{NPV} = -1000 + \frac{-4000}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{5000}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{2000}{(1+r)^3} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

In this case, the answer is 25.48% (with this conventional pattern of cash flows, the project has a unique IRR).

To calculate the MIRR, we will assume a finance rate of 10% and a reinvestment rate of 12%. First, we calculate the present value of the negative cash flows (discounted at the finance rate):

&lt;math&gt;PV(\text{negative cash flows, finance rate}) = -1000 + \frac{-4000}{(1+10\%)^1} = -4636.36&lt;/math&gt;.

Second, we calculate the future value of the positive cash flows (reinvested at the reinvestment rate):

&lt;math&gt;FV(\text{positive cash flows, reinvestment rate}) = 5000\cdot(1+12\%)^1 + 2000 = 7600&lt;/math&gt;.

Third, we find the MIRR:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{MIRR}=\sqrt[3]{\frac{7600}{4636.36}}-1=17.91\%&lt;/math&gt;.

The calculated MIRR (17.91%) is significantly different from the IRR (25.48%).

==Comparing projects of different sizes==
Like the internal rate of return, the modified internal rate of return is not valid for ranking projects of different sizes, because a larger project with a smaller modified internal rate of return may have a higher net present value.  However, there exist variants of the modified internal rate of return which can be used for such comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Shull, D. M., "Efficient capital project selection through a yield-based capital budgeting technique," ''The Engineering Economist'' 38(1), 1992, 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hajdasinski, M., "Remarks in the context of 'The case for the generalized net present value formula'," ''The Engineering Economist'' 40(2), 1995, 201-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Moore method''' is a [[deductive]] manner of instruction used in advanced [[mathematics]] courses. It is named after [[Robert Lee Moore]], a famous topologist who first used a stronger version of the method at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] when he began teaching there in&amp;nbsp;1911.

The way the course is conducted varies from instructor to instructor, but the content of the course is usually presented in whole or in part by the students themselves. Instead of using a textbook, the students are given a list of definitions and theorems which they are to prove and present in class, leading them through the subject material. The Moore method typically limits the amount of material that a class is able to cover, but its advocates claim that it induces a depth of understanding that listening to lectures cannot give.

==The original method==

[[F. Burton Jones]], a student of Moore and a practitioner of his method, described it as follows:

{{quote|Moore would begin his graduate course in topology by carefully selecting the members of the class. If a student had already studied topology elsewhere or had read too much, he would exclude him (in some cases, he would run a separate class for such students). The idea was to have a class as homogeneously ignorant (topologically) as possible. He would usually caution the group not to read topology but simply to use their own ability. Plainly he wanted the competition to be as fair as possible, for competition was one of the driving forces. […]

Having selected the class he would tell them briefly his view of the axiomatic method: there were certain undefined terms (e.g., 'point' and 'region') which had meaning restricted (or controlled) by the axioms (e.g., a region is a point set). He would then state the axioms that the class were to start with […]

After stating the axioms and giving motivating examples to illustrate their meaning he would then state some definitions and theorems. He simply read them from his book as the students copied them down. He would then instruct the class to find proofs of their own and also to construct examples to show that the hypotheses of the theorems could not be weakened, omitted, or partially omitted.

When the class returned for the next meeting he would call on some student to prove Theorem 1. After he became familiar with the abilities of the class members, he would call on them in reverse order and in this way give the more unsuccessful students first chance when they did get a proof. He was flexible with this procedure but it was clear that this was the way he preferred it.

When a student stated that he could prove Theorem ''x'', he was asked to go to the blackboard and present his proof. Then the other students, especially those who had not been able to discover a proof, would make sure that the proof presented was correct and convincing. Moore sternly prevented heckling. This was seldom necessary because the whole atmosphere was one of a serious community effort to understand the argument.

When a flaw appeared in a 'proof' everyone would patiently wait for the student at the board to 'patch it up.' If he could not, he would sit down. Moore would then ask the next student to try or if he thought the difficulty encountered was sufficiently interesting, he would save that theorem until next time and go on to the next unproved theorem (starting again at the bottom of the class).
|(Jones 1977)}}

The students were forbidden to read any book or article about the subject. They were even forbidden to talk about it outside of class.  Hersh and John-Steiner claim that, "this method is reminiscent of a well-known, old method of teaching swimming called 'sink or swim' ".

After Moore became an associate-professor at [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1920, the Moore method began to gain popularity.  Today, the University of Texas at Austin remains a strong advocate of the method and uses it in various courses within their mathematics department, including:
* [[Number theory]]
* [[Real analysis]]
* [[Point-set topology]]
* [[Mathematical Logic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vl/teaching/ Vladimir Lifschitz's Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17814">In [[mathematics]], more specifically [[Abstract algebra|modern algebra]] and [[commutative algebra]], '''Nakayama's lemma''' &amp;mdash; also known as the '''Krull–Azumaya theorem'''&lt;ref name="Nagata"&gt;{{harvnb|Nagata|1962|loc=§A.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; governs the interaction between the [[Jacobson radical]] of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] (typically a [[commutative ring]]) and its [[finitely-generated module|finitely generated]] [[Module (mathematics)|modules]].  Informally, the lemma immediately gives a precise sense in which finitely generated modules over a commutative ring behave like [[vector space]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. It is an important tool in [[algebraic geometry]], because it allows local data on [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], in the form of modules over [[local ring]]s, to be studied pointwise as vector spaces over the residue field of the ring.

The lemma is named after the Japanese [[mathematician]] [[Tadashi Nakayama (mathematician)|Tadashi Nakayama]] and introduced in its present form in {{harvtxt|Nakayama|1951}}, although it was first discovered in the special case of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in a commutative ring by [[Wolfgang Krull]] and then in general by [[Goro Azumaya]] ([[#CITEREFAzumaya1951|1951]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagata|1962|loc=§A.2}}; {{harvnb|Matsumura|1989|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the commutative case, the lemma is a simple consequence of a generalized form of the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]], an observation made by [[Michael Atiyah]] ([[#CITEREFAtiyahMacdonald1969|1969]]).  The special case of the noncommutative version of the lemma for right ideals appears in [[Nathan Jacobson]] ([[#CITEREFJacobson1945|1945]]), and so the noncommutative Nakayama lemma is sometimes known as the '''Jacobson–Azumaya theorem'''.&lt;ref name="Nagata" /&gt; The latter has various applications in the theory of [[Jacobson radical]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Isaacs|1993|loc=Corollary 13.13, p. 184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
Let ''R'' be a [[commutative ring]] with identity 1.  The following is Nakayama's lemma, as stated in {{harvtxt|Matsumura|1989}}:

'''Statement 1''':  Let ''I'' be an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in ''R'', and ''M'' a [[finitely-generated module]] over ''R''.  If ''IM'' = ''M'', then there exists an ''r'' &amp;isin; ''R'' with ''r'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''I''), such that ''rM''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

This is proven [[#Proof|below]].

The following corollary is also known as Nakayama's lemma, and it is in this form that it most often appears.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Corollary 4.8}}; {{harvtxt|Atiyah|Macdonald|1969|loc=Proposition 2.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Statement 2''': If ''M'' is a finitely-generated module over ''R'', J(''R'') is the [[Jacobson radical]] of ''R'', and J(''R'')''M'' = ''M'', then ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
:''Proof'': ''r'' &amp;minus; 1 (with ''r'' as above) is in the Jacobson radical so  ''r'' is invertible.

More generally, one has

'''Statement 3''': If ''M'' is a finitely-generated module over ''R'', ''N'' is a submodule of ''M'', and ''M'' = ''N'' + J(''R'')''M'', then ''M'' = ''N''.
:''Proof'': Apply Statement 2 to ''M''/''N''.

The following result manifests Nakayama's lemma in terms of generators&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Corollary 4.8(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Statement 4''': If ''M'' is a finitely-generated module over ''R'' and the images of elements ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''M'' in ''M'' / ''J''(''R'')''M'' generate ''M'' / ''J''(''R'')''M'' as an ''R''-module, then ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; also generate ''M'' as an ''R''-module.
:''Proof'': Apply Statement 3 to ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''Rm''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

If one assumes instead that ''R'' is [[completion (ring theory)|complete]] and ''M'' is separated with respect to the ''I''-adic topology for an ideal ''I'' in ''R'', this last statement holds with ''I'' in place of ''J''(''R'') and without assuming in advance that ''M'' is finitely generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Exercise 7.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here separatedness means that the ''I''-adic topology satisfies the [[T1 space|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] separation axiom, and is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\bigcap_{k=1}^\infty I^k M = 0.}&lt;/math&gt;

==Consequences==

===Local rings===
In the special case of a finitely generated module ''M'' over a [[local ring]] ''R'' with [[maximal ideal]] ''m'', the quotient ''M''/''mM'' is a vector space over the field ''R''/''m''.  Statement 4 then implies that a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of ''M''/''mM'' lifts to a minimal set of generators of ''M''.  Conversely, every minimal set of generators of ''M'' is obtained in this way, and any two such sets of generators are related by an [[invertible matrix]] with entries in the ring.

In this form, Nakayama's lemma takes on concrete geometrical significance.  Local rings arise in geometry as the [[germ (mathematics)|germ]]s of functions at a point.  Finitely generated modules over local rings arise quite often as germs of [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] of [[vector bundle]]s.  Working at the level of germs rather than points, the notion of finite-dimensional vector bundle gives way to that of a [[coherent sheaf]].  Informally, Nakayama's lemma says that one can still regard a coherent sheaf as coming from a vector bundle in some sense.  More precisely, let ''F'' be a coherent sheaf of '''O'''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;-modules over an arbitrary [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] ''X''.  The [[stalk (mathematics)|stalk]] of ''F'' at a point ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'', denoted by ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, is a module over the local ring '''O'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The fibre of ''F'' at ''p'' is the vector space ''F''(''p'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''/''m&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximal ideal of '''O'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Nakayama's lemma implies that a basis of the fibre ''F''(''p'') lifts to a minimal set of generators of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.  That is:
* Any basis of the fiber of a coherent sheaf ''F'' at a point comes from a minimal basis of local sections.

===Going up and going down===
{{main|Going up and going down}}
The '''going up theorem''' is essentially a corollary of Nakayama's lemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenbud|1993|loc=§4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It asserts:

* Let ''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sub;&amp;nbsp;''S'' be an [[integral extension]] of commutative rings, and ''P'' a [[prime ideal]] of ''R''.  Then there is a prime ideal ''Q'' in ''S'' such that ''Q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;cap;&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''.  Moreover, ''Q'' can be chosen to contain any prime ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of ''S'' such that ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;cap;&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sub;&amp;nbsp;''P''.

===Module epimorphisms===
Nakayama's lemma makes precise one sense in which finitely generated modules over a commutative ring are like vector spaces over a field.  The following consequence of Nakayama's lemma gives another way in which this is true:

*If ''M'' is a finitely generated ''R''-module and ''&amp;fnof;''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''M'' is a surjective endomorphism, then ''&amp;fnof;'' is an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matsumura|1989|loc=Theorem 2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a local ring, one can say more about module epimorphisms:&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|Harris|1994|p=681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Suppose that ''R'' is a local ring with maximal ideal ''m'', and ''M'', ''N'' are finitely generated ''R''-modules.  If &amp;phi;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''N'' is an ''R''-linear map such that the quotient &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''M''/''mM''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''N''/''mN'' is surjective, then &amp;phi; is surjective.

===Homological versions===
Nakayama's lemma also has several versions in [[homological algebra]].  The above statement about epimorphisms can be used to show:&lt;ref name="Griffiths" /&gt;

* Let ''M'' be a finitely generated module over a local ring.  Then ''M'' is [[projective module|projective]] if and only if it is [[free module|free]].
A geometrical and global counterpart to this is the [[Serre–Swan theorem]], relating projective modules and coherent sheaves.

More generally, one has&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenbud|1993|loc=Corollary 19.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let ''R'' be a local ring and ''M'' a finitely generated module over ''R''.  Then the [[projective dimension]] of ''M'' over ''R'' is equal to the length of every minimal [[free resolution]] of ''M''.  Moreover, the projective dimension is equal to the global dimension of ''M'', which is by definition the smallest integer ''i''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 such that
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tor}_{i+1}^R(k,M) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
:Here ''k'' is the residue field of ''R'' and Tor is the [[tor functor]].

==Proof==
A standard proof of the Nakayama lemma uses the following technique due to {{harvtxt|Atiyah|Macdonald|1969}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matsumura|1989|p=7}}: "A standard technique applicable to finite ''A''-modules is the 'determinant trick'..."  See also the proof contained in {{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=§4.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let ''M'' be an ''R''-module generated by ''n'' elements, and &amp;phi;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''M'' an ''R''-linear map.  If there is an ideal ''I'' of ''R'' such that &amp;phi;(''M'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;sub;&amp;nbsp;''IM'', then there is a [[monic polynomial]]
::&lt;math&gt;p(x) = x^n + p_1x^{n-1}+\cdots + p_n&lt;/math&gt;
:with ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''I''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, such that
::&lt;math&gt;p(\varphi)=0&lt;/math&gt;
:as an endomorphism of ''M''.

This assertion is precisely a generalized version of the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]], and the proof proceeds along the same lines.  On the generators ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''M'', one has a relation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(x_i) = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_j&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''I''.  Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n\left(\varphi\delta_{ij} - a_{ij}\right)x_j = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The required result follows by multiplying by the [[Cofactor (linear algebra)#Adjugate|adjugate]] of the matrix (&amp;phi;&amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;) and invoking [[Cramer's rule]].  One finds then det(&amp;phi;&amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, so the required polynomial is
:&lt;math&gt;p(t) = \det(t\delta_{ij}-a_{ij}).&lt;/math&gt;

To prove Nakayama's lemma from the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, assume that ''IM''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M'' and take &amp;phi; to be the identity on ''M''.  Then define a polynomial ''p''(''x'') as above.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;r=p(1) = 1+p_1+p_2+\cdots+p_n&lt;/math&gt;
has the required property.

==Noncommutative case==
A version of the lemma holds for right modules over non-commutative [[unital ring]]s ''R''.  The resulting theorem is sometimes known as the '''Jacobson–Azumaya theorem'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagata|1962|loc=§A2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let J(''R'') be the [[Jacobson radical]] of ''R''. If ''U'' is a right module over a ring, ''R'', and ''I'' is a right ideal in ''R'', then define ''U'''''·'''''I'' to be the set of all (finite) sums of elements of the form ''u'''''·'''''i'', where '''·''' is simply the action of ''R'' on ''U''. Necessarily, ''U'''''·'''''I'' is a submodule of ''U''.

If ''V'' is a [[maximal submodule]] of ''U'', then ''U''/''V'' is [[Simple module|simple]].  So ''U'''''·'''J(''R'') is necessarily a subset of ''V'', by the definition of J(''R'') and the fact that ''U''/''V'' is simple.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Isaacs|1993|p= 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if ''U'' contains at least one (proper) maximal submodule, ''U'''''·'''J(''R'') is a proper submodule of ''U''. However, this need not hold for arbitrary modules ''U'' over ''R'', for ''U'' need not contain any maximal submodules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Isaacs|1993|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, if ''U'' is a [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] module, this holds. If ''R'' is Noetherian, and ''U'' is [[Finitely generated module|finitely generated]], then ''U'' is a Noetherian module over ''R'', and the conclusion is satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Isaacs|1993|loc=Theorem 12.19, p. 172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat remarkable is that the weaker assumption, namely that ''U'' is finitely generated as an ''R''-module (and no finiteness assumption on ''R''), is sufficient to guarantee the conclusion. This is essentially the statement of Nakayama's lemma.&lt;ref name="Isaacs"&gt;{{harvnb|Isaacs|1993|loc=Theorem 13.11, p. 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precisely, one has:
:'''Nakayama's lemma''': Let ''U'' be a [[Finitely generated module|finitely generated]] right module over a ring ''R''.  If ''U'' is a non-zero module, then ''U'''''·'''J(''R'') is a proper submodule of ''U''.&lt;ref name="Isaacs" /&gt;

===Proof===
Let ''X'' be a finite subset of ''U'', minimal with respect to the property that it generates ''U''. Since ''U'' is non-zero, this set ''X'' is nonempty. Denote every element of ''X'' by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;i\in \{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''X'' generates ''U'',

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n x_i R = U&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose, &lt;math&gt;U\cdot \operatorname J(R) = U&lt;/math&gt;, to obtain a contradiction. Since, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\in U&lt;/math&gt;, we conclude,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i r_i) j_i = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;r_i\in R&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;j_i\in J(R)&lt;/math&gt;

By associativity,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n x_i (r_i j_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''J''(''R'') is a (two-sided) ideal in ''R'', we have &lt;math&gt;r_i j_i \in J\left(R\right)&lt;/math&gt; for every ''i'', and thus this becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n x_i k_i = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;k_i\in \operatorname J(R)&lt;/math&gt;

Applying distributivity,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n x_i (1 - k_i) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;k_i\in \operatorname J(R)&lt;/math&gt;, it is [[Quasiregular element|quasiregular]] and thus, &lt;math&gt;1 - k_i\in U(R)&lt;/math&gt;, for all ''i'', where ''U''(''R'') denotes the group of [[Unit (ring theory)|units]] in ''R''. Choose some ''j'' and write,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n x_i (1 - k_i) (1 - k_j)^{-1} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\neq j} x_i (1 - k_i) (1 - k_j)^{-1} = -x_j&lt;/math&gt;

Thus ''x''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; is a linear combination of the elements of ''X'' distinct from ''x''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;. This contradicts the minimality of ''X'' and establishes the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Isaacs|1993|loc=Theorem 13.11, p. 183}}; {{harvnb|Isaacs|1993|loc=Corollary 13.12, p. 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graded version==

There is also a graded version of Nakayama's lemma. Let ''R'' be a ring that is [[graded ring|graded]] by the ordered semi group of non-negative integers, and let &lt;math&gt;R_+&lt;/math&gt; denote the ideal generated by positively graded elements. Then if ''M'' is a graded module over ''R'' for which &lt;math&gt;M_i = 0&lt;/math&gt; for ''i'' sufficiently negative (in particular, if ''M'' is finitely generated and ''R'' does not contain elements of negative degree) such that &lt;math&gt;R_+M = M&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;M = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Of particular importance is the case that ''R'' is a polynomial ring with the standard grading, and ''M'' is a finitely generated module.

The proof is much easier than in the ungraded case: taking ''i'' to be the least integer such that &lt;math&gt;M_i \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; does not appear in &lt;math&gt;R_+M&lt;/math&gt;, so either &lt;math&gt;M \ne R_+M&lt;/math&gt;, or such an ''i'' does not exist, i.e., &lt;math&gt;M = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The calculation of air-space flux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education==
Calderwood was born in 1896 in [[Blairgowrie and Rattray|Blairgowrie]], [[Perthshire]], in Scotland. Her father Daniel Scott Calderwood was the headmaster of the Blairgowrie Public School. Her family then moved to [[Edinburgh]] when she was still young, after her father was appointed as the headmaster of the Church of Scotland Normal School.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Calderwood|title=Nora Isobel Calderwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calderwood started at James Gillespie's School in 1901, at the age of five, staying for six years. On receiving a bursary from the Edinburgh Burgh Committee on Secondary Education, she studied at Edinburgh Ladies' College from 1907 to 1914.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1910, at the age of 14, she passed Higher Piano, and in 1913 was named the dux of the music classes at Edinburgh Ladies' College. She was also awarded the prize to the best Science scholar and best Arithmetician, both of which she resigned, and the Costorphine Prize for the best mathematician.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Calderwood studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1914 to 1920, earning a [[Bachelor of Science]] (Pure) in 1919 and a [[Master of Arts]] in Political Economy in 1920. Courses taken include Mathematics, Latin, Natural Philosophy, and Chemistry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She joined the faculty of [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham University]] the following year, lecturing in mathematics. Soon, however, she returned to Edinburgh to continue her studies under mathematician [[Alexander Aitken]], earning a [[PhD]] in mathematics from the University in 1931 with a thesis on ''Researches in the Theory of Matrices.''&lt;ref name=phd&gt;{{Cite thesis|title=Researches in the theory of matrices|last=Calderwood|first=Nora I.|publisher=University of Edinburgh|year=1931|isbn=|location=|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.642319}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mathgene/&gt;

==Career and research==
Calderwood was a member of [[Edinburgh Mathematical Society]] joined in 1919 as an undergraduate, and the [[London Mathematical Society]], joined in 1922.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She is fondly listed by a student, Margaret Lee née Ireland (1962 BSc Mathematics) as one of her favourite memories: "Dr Nora Calderwood - what a woman who loved us so much, she could barely keep exam questions secret".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/alumni/Memories/MemoriesandMessagesfromtheClassof1962.pdf|title=Memories and Messages from the Class of 1962|last=|first=|year=2016|publisher=The University of Birmingham|website=birmingham.ac.uk|author=Anon|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Numerical Recipes''''' is the generic title of a series of books on [[algorithm]]s and [[numerical analysis]] by [[William H. Press]], [[Saul A. Teukolsky]], William T. Vetterling and [[Brian P. Flannery]]. In various editions, the books have been in print since 1986.  The most recent edition was published in 2007.  In 2015 Numerical Recipes sold its historic two-letter domain name nr.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domaingang.com/domain-news/two-letter-domain-nr-com-sold-rebrands-to-numerical-recipes/|title=Two letter domain NR.com sold : Rebrands to Numerical.Recipes|date=14 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became &lt;code&gt;numerical.recipes&lt;/code&gt; instead.

==Overview==
The ''Numerical Recipes'' books cover a range of topics that include both classical [[numerical analysis]] ([[interpolation]], [[Numerical integration|integration]], [[linear algebra]], [[differential equations]], and so on), signal processing ([[Fast Fourier transform|Fourier methods]], [[Digital filter|filtering]]), statistical treatment of data, and a few topics in machine learning ([[hidden Markov model]], [[support vector machines]]).  The writing style is accessible and has an informal tone.  The emphasis is on understanding the underlying basics of techniques, not on the refinements that may, in practice, be needed to achieve optimal performance and reliability.  Few results are proved with any degree of rigor, although the ideas behind proofs are often sketched, and references are given. Importantly, virtually all methods that are discussed are also implemented in a [[programming language]], with the code printed in the book. Each version is keyed to a specific language.

According to the publisher, [[Cambridge University Press]], the ''Numerical Recipes'' books are historically the all-time best-selling books on scientific programming methods.  In recent years, ''Numerical Recipes'' books have been cited in the scientific literature more than 3000 times per year according to [[ISI Web of Knowledge]] (e.g., 3962 times in the year 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomson Reuters]], [http://www.isiwebofknowledge.com/ Web of Knowledge], Cited Reference Search.&lt;/ref&gt; And as of the end of 2017, the book had over 44000 citation on [[Google Scholar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cites=9526883588545811444&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en], Google Scholar&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first publication was in 1986 with the title,”Numerical Recipes, The Art of Scientific Computing,” containing code in both Fortran and Pascal; an accompanying book, “Numerical Recipes Example Book (Pascal) was first published in 1985. (A preface note in “Examples" mentions that the main book was also published in 1985, but the official note in that book says 1986.) Supplemental editions followed with code in Pascal, BASIC, and C. ''Numerical Recipes'' took, from the start, an opinionated editorial position at odds with the conventional wisdom of the numerical analysis community:

{{cquote|If there is a single dominant theme in this book, it is that practical methods of numerical computation can be simultaneously efficient, clever, and — important — clear.  The alternative viewpoint, that efficient computational methods must necessarily be so arcane and complex as to be useful only in "black box" form, we firmly reject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

However, as it turned out, the 1980s were fertile years for the "black box" side, yielding important libraries such as [[BLAS]] and [[LAPACK]], and integrated environments like [[MATLAB]] and [[Mathematica]]. By the early 1990s, when Second Edition versions of ''Numerical Recipes'' (with code in C, Fortran-77, and Fortran-90) were published, it was clear that the constituency for ''Numerical Recipes'' was by no means the majority of scientists doing computation, but only that slice that lived ''between'' the more mathematical numerical analysts and the larger community using integrated environments. The Second Edition versions occupied a stable role in this niche environment.&lt;ref name="cip"&gt;Press, William H.; and Teukolsky, Saul A.; "Numerical Recipes: Does This Paradigm Have a Future?," Computers in Physics, 11, 416 (1997). [http://numerical.recipes/whp/CIPso97.ps Preprint.]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-2000s, the practice of scientific computing had been radically altered by the mature Internet and Web. Recognizing that their ''Numerical Recipes'' books were increasingly valued more for their explanatory text than for their code examples, the authors significantly expanded the scope of the book, and significantly rewrote a large part of the text. They continued to include code, still printed in the book, now in C++, for every method discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Criticism==
The code listings are copyrighted and commercially licensed by the ''Numerical Recipes'' authors.&lt;ref&gt;Numerical Recipes Web site, [http://numerical.recipes/aboutNR3code.html Numerical Recipes Code]&lt;/ref&gt; One early motivation for the [[GNU Scientific Library]] was that a [[free software|free]] library was needed as a substitute for ''Numerical Recipes''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Another line of criticism centers on the coding style of the books, which strike some modern readers as "Fortran-ish", though written in contemporary, object-oriented C++. The authors have defended their very terse coding style as necessary to the format of the book because of space limitations and for readability.&lt;ref name="cip" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8708">[[Fluid motion]] is governed by the [[Navier–Stokes equations]], a set of coupled and nonlinear
partial differential equations derived from the basic laws of conservation of [[mass]], [[momentum]]
and [[energy]]. The unknowns are usually the [[flow velocity]], the [[pressure]] and [[density]]  and [[temperature]]. The [[analytical solution]] of this equation is impossible hence scientists resort to laboratory experiments in such situations. The answers delivered are, however, usually qualitatively different since dynamical and geometric similitude are difficult to enforce simultaneously between the lab experiment and the [[prototype]]. Furthermore, the design and construction of these experiments can be difficult (and costly), particularly for stratified rotating flows. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) is an additional tool in the arsenal of scientists. In its early days CFD was often controversial, as it involved additional approximation to the governing equations and raised additional (legitimate) issues. Nowadays CFD is an established discipline alongside theoretical and experimental methods. This position is in large part due to the exponential growth of computer power which has allowed us to tackle ever larger and more complex problems.

==Discretization==
The central process in CFD is the process of [[discretization]], i.e. the process of taking differential equations with an infinite number of [[degrees of freedom]], and reducing it to a system of finite degrees of freedom. Hence, instead of determining the solution everywhere and for all times, we will be satisfied with its calculation at a finite number of locations and at specified time intervals. The [[partial differential equations]] are then reduced to a system of algebraic equations that can be solved on a computer. Errors creep in during the discretization process. The nature and characteristics of the errors must be controlled in order to ensure that:
* we are solving the correct equations (consistency property)
* that the error can be decreased as we increase the number of degrees of freedom (stability and convergence).
Once these two criteria are established, the power of computing machines can be leveraged to solve the problem in a numerically reliable fashion. Various discretization schemes have been developed to cope with a variety of issues. The most notable for our purposes are: [[finite difference methods]], finite volume methods, [[finite element methods]], and [[spectral methods]].

==Finite difference method==
Finite difference replace the infinitesimal limiting process of derivative calculation:
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}f'(x) = \frac {f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x} &lt;/math&gt;

with a finite limiting process,i.e.

:&lt;math&gt; f'(x) =\frac {f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x} + O(\Delta x) &lt;/math&gt;

The term &lt;math&gt;O(\Delta x)&lt;/math&gt; gives an indication of the magnitude of the error as a function of the mesh spacing. In this instance, the error is halfed if the grid spacing, _x is halved, and we say that this is a first order method. Most FDM used in practice are at least second order accurate except in very special circumstances. Finite Difference method is still the most popular numerical method for solution of PDEs because of their simplicity, efficiency and low computational cost. Their major drawback is in their geometric inflexibility which complicates their applications to general complex domains. These can be alleviated by the use of either mapping techniques and/or masking to fit the computational mesh to the computational domain.

==Finite element method==
The finite element method was designed to deal with problem with complicated computational regions. The PDE is first recast into a variational form which essentially forces the mean error to be small everywhere. The discretization step proceeds by dividing the computational domain into elements of triangular or rectangular shape. The solution within each element is interpolated with a polynomial of usually low order. Again, the unknowns are the solution at the collocation points. The CFD community adopted the FEM in the 1980s when reliable methods for dealing with advection dominated problems were devised.

==Spectral method==
Both finite element and finite difference methods are low order methods, usually of 2nd&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4th order, and have local approximation property. By local we mean that a particular collocation point is affected by a limited number of points around it. In contrast, spectral method have global approximation property. The interpolation functions, either polynomials or trigonomic functions are global in nature. Their main benefits is in the rate of convergence which depends on the smoothness of the solution (i.e. how many continuous derivatives does it admit). For infinitely smooth solution, the error decreases exponentially, i.e. faster than algebraic. Spectral methods are mostly used in the computations of homogeneous turbulence, and require relatively simple geometries. Atmospheric model have also adopted spectral methods because of their convergence properties and the regular spherical shape of their computational domain.

==Finite volume method==
Finite volume methods are primarily used in [[aerodynamics]] applications where strong shocks and discontinuities in the solution occur. Finite volume method solves an integral form of the governing equations so that local continuity property do not have to hold.

==Computational cost==
The [[CPU]] time to solve the system of equations differs substantially from method to method. Finite differences are usually the cheapest on a per grid point basis followed by the finite element method and spectral method. However, a per grid point basis comparison is a little like comparing apple and oranges. Spectral methods deliver more accuracy on a per grid point basis than either [[Finite element method|FEM]] or [[Finite difference method|FDM]]. The comparison is more meaningful if the question is recast as ”what is the computational cost to achieve a given error tolerance?”. The problem becomes one of defining the error measure which is a complicated task in general situations.

==Forward Euler approximation==
:&lt;math&gt; \frac {u^{n+1} -u^n}{\Delta t } \approx \kappa u^n &lt;/math&gt;

Equation is an explicit approximation to the original differential equation since no information about the unknown function at the future time (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; has been used on the right hand side of the equation. In order to derive the error committed in the approximation we rely again on Taylor series.

==Backward difference==
This is an example of an implicit method since the unknown ''u''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) has been used in evaluating the slope of the solution on the right hand side; this is not a problem to solve for ''u''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) in this scalar and linear case. For more complicated situations like a nonlinear right hand side or a system of equations, a nonlinear system of equations may have to be inverted.

In the field of [[digital signal processing]], the '''sampling theorem''' is a fundamental bridge between [[continuous-time signal]]s (often called "analog signals") and [[discrete-time signal]]s (often called "digital signals"). It establishes a sufficient condition for a [[sample rate]] that permits a discrete sequence of ''samples'' to capture all the information from a continuous-time signal of finite [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].

Strictly speaking, the theorem only applies to a class of [[mathematical function]]s having a [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] that is zero outside of a finite region of frequencies. Intuitively we expect that when one reduces a continuous function to a discrete sequence and [[interpolates]] back to a continuous function, the fidelity of the result depends on the density (or [[Sampling (signal processing)|sample rate]]) of the original samples. The sampling theorem introduces the concept of a sample rate that is sufficient for perfect fidelity for the class of functions that are [[bandlimited]] to a given bandwidth, such that no actual information is lost in the sampling process. It expresses the sufficient sample rate in terms of the bandwidth for the class of functions. The theorem also leads to a formula for perfectly reconstructing the original continuous-time function from the samples.

Perfect reconstruction may still be possible when the sample-rate criterion is not satisfied, provided other constraints on the signal are known. (See {{sectionlink||Sampling of non-baseband signals}} below and [[compressed sensing]].) In some cases (when the sample-rate criterion is not satisfied), utilizing additional constraints allows for approximate reconstructions. The fidelity of these reconstructions can be verified and quantified utilizing [[Bochner's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Nemirovsky|first1=Jonathan|last2=Shimron|first2=Efrat|title=Utilizing Bochners Theorem for Constrained Evaluation of Missing Fourier Data|journal= |arxiv=1506.03300 |class=physics.med-ph |date=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem'' honors [[Harry Nyquist]] and [[Claude Shannon]]. The theorem was also discovered independently by [[E. T. Whittaker]], by [[Vladimir Kotelnikov]], and by others. It is thus also known by the names ''Nyquist–Shannon–Kotelnikov'', ''Whittaker–Shannon–Kotelnikov'', ''Whittaker–Nyquist–Kotelnikov–Shannon'', and ''cardinal theorem of interpolation''.

==Introduction==
[[Sampling (signal processing)|Sampling]] is a process of converting a signal (for example, a function of continuous time and/or space) into a numeric sequence (a function of discrete time and/or space). [[Claude Shannon|Shannon's]] version of the theorem states:&lt;ref name="Shannon49"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=refShannon49 |author=Shannon, Claude E. |authorlink =Claude Shannon |title =Communication in the presence of noise |journal =Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers |volume =37 |issue =1 |pages =10–21 |date =January 1949 |doi=10.1109/jrproc.1949.232969}} [http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee104/shannonpaper.pdf Reprint as classic paper in: ''Proc. IEEE'', Vol. 86, No. 2, (Feb 1998)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208112344/http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee104/shannonpaper.pdf |date=2010-02-08 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; contains no frequencies higher than ''B''&amp;nbsp;[[hertz]], it is completely determined by giving its ordinates at a series of points spaced &lt;math&gt;1/(2B)&lt;/math&gt; seconds apart.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A sufficient sample-rate is therefore anything larger than &lt;math&gt;2B&lt;/math&gt; samples per second. Equivalently, for a given sample rate &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt;, perfect reconstruction is guaranteed possible for a bandlimit &lt;math&gt;B &lt; f_s/2&lt;/math&gt;.

When the bandlimit is too high (or there is no bandlimit), the reconstruction exhibits imperfections known as [[aliasing]]. Modern statements of the theorem are sometimes careful to explicitly state that &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; must contain no [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] component at exactly frequency ''B'', or that ''B'' must be strictly less than ½ the sample rate.  The threshold &lt;math&gt;2B&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''[[Nyquist rate]]''' and is an attribute of the continuous-time input &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; to be sampled. The sample rate must exceed the Nyquist rate for the samples to suffice to represent ''x''(''t'').  The threshold ''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/2 is called the '''[[Nyquist frequency]]''' and is an attribute of the [[Analog-to-digital_converter|sampling equipment]].  All meaningful frequency components of the properly sampled ''x''(''t'') exist below the Nyquist frequency.  The condition described by these inequalities is called the '''Nyquist criterion''', or sometimes the ''Raabe condition''.  The theorem is also applicable to functions of other domains, such as ''space,'' in the case of a digitized image. The only change, in the case of other domains, is the units of measure applied to ''t'', ''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''B''.

[[File:Sinc function (normalized).svg|thumb|right|250px|The normalized [[sinc function]]: {{nowrap|sin(π''x'') / (π''x'')}} ... showing the central peak at {{nowrap|1=''x''= 0}}, and zero-crossings at the other integer values of ''x''.]]

The {{nowrap|1=symbol ''T'' = 1/''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is customarily used to represent the interval between samples and is called the '''sample period''' or '''sampling interval'''. And the samples of function ''x''(''t'') are commonly denoted by {{nowrap|1=''x''[''n''] = ''x''(''nT'')}} (alternatively "''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''" in older signal processing literature), for all integer values of ''n''. A mathematically ideal way to interpolate the sequence involves the use of [[sinc function]]s. Each sample in the sequence is replaced by a sinc function, centered on the time axis at the original location of the sample, ''nT'', with the amplitude of the sinc function scaled to the sample value, ''x''[''n'']. Subsequently, the sinc functions are summed into a continuous function. A mathematically equivalent method is to convolve one sinc function with a series of [[Dirac delta]] pulses, weighted by the sample values. Neither method is numerically practical. Instead, some type of approximation of the sinc functions, finite in length, is used. The imperfections attributable to the approximation are known as ''interpolation error''.

Practical [[digital-to-analog converter]]s produce neither scaled and delayed sinc functions, nor ideal Dirac pulses. Instead they produce a [[piecewise-constant]] sequence of scaled and delayed [[rectangular function|rectangular pulses]] (the [[zero-order hold]]), usually followed by an "anti-aliasing filter" to clean up spurious high-frequency content.

==Aliasing==

When &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a function with a [[Fourier transform]] &lt;math&gt;X(f)&lt;/math&gt;''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;X(f)\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) \ e^{- i 2 \pi f t} \ {\rm d}t,&lt;/math&gt;

the [[Poisson summation formula]] indicates that the samples, &lt;math&gt;x(nT)&lt;/math&gt;, of &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; are sufficient to create a [[periodic summation]] of &lt;math&gt;X(f)&lt;/math&gt;. The result is''':'''

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;X_s(f)\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} X\left(f - k f_s\right) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} T\cdot x(nT)\ e^{-i 2\pi n T f},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}

[[File:AliasedSpectrum.png|thumb|400px|right|''X''(''f'') (top blue) and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'') (bottom blue) are continuous Fourier transforms of two {{em|different}} functions, &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_A(t)&lt;/math&gt; (not shown). When the functions are sampled at rate &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt;, the images (green) are added to the original transforms (blue) when one examines the discrete-time Fourier transforms (DTFT) of the sequences. In this hypothetical example, the DTFTs are identical, which means {{em|the sampled sequences are identical}}, even though the original continuous pre-sampled functions are not. If these were audio signals, &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_A(t)&lt;/math&gt; might not sound the same. But their samples (taken at rate ''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) are identical and would lead to identical reproduced sounds; thus ''x''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') is an alias of ''x''(''t'') at this sample rate.]]

which is a periodic function and its equivalent representation as a [[Fourier series]], whose coefficients are ''T''•''x''(''nT''). This function is also known as the [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT) of the sequence ''T''•''x''(''nT''), for integers n.

As depicted, copies of ''X''(''f'') are shifted by multiples of ''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and combined by addition. For a band-limited function &amp;nbsp;(''X''(''f'') = ''0'' for all |''f''| ≥ ''B''),&amp;nbsp; and sufficiently large ''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', it is possible for the copies to remain distinct from each other. But if the Nyquist criterion is not satisfied, adjacent copies overlap, and it is not possible in general to discern an unambiguous ''X''(''f''). Any frequency component above ''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/2 is indistinguishable from a lower-frequency component, called an ''alias'', associated with one of the copies. In such cases, the customary interpolation techniques produce the alias, rather than the original component. When the sample-rate is pre-determined by other considerations (such as an industry standard), ''x''(''t'') is usually filtered to reduce its high frequencies to acceptable levels before it is sampled. The type of filter required is a [[lowpass filter]], and in this application it is called an [[anti-aliasing filter]].

==Derivation as a special case of Poisson summation==
When there is no overlap of the copies (also known as "images") of &lt;math&gt;X(f)&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;1/(2B)&lt;/math&gt; term of &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt; can be recovered by the product''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;X(f) = H(f) \cdot X_s(f),&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; where''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;H(f)\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \begin{cases}1 &amp; |f| &lt; B \\ 0 &amp; |f| &gt; f_s - B. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

At this point, the sampling theorem is proved, since &lt;math&gt;X(f)&lt;/math&gt; uniquely determines &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

All that remains is to derive the formula for reconstruction. &lt;math&gt;H(f)&lt;/math&gt; need not be precisely defined in the region &lt;math&gt;[B,f_s-B]&lt;/math&gt; because ''X''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'') is zero in that region. However, the worst case is when ''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/2, the Nyquist frequency. A function that is sufficient for that and all less severe cases is''':'''

where rect(•) is the [[rectangular function]].&amp;nbsp; Therefore''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;X(f) = \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{f}{f_s} \right) \cdot X_s(f)&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt; = \mathrm{rect}(Tf)\cdot \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} T\cdot x(nT)\ e^{-i 2\pi n T f}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (from &amp;nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.1}}, above).
:::&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT)\cdot \underbrace{T\cdot \mathrm{rect} (Tf) \cdot e^{-i 2\pi n T f}}_{
\mathcal{F}\left \{
 \mathrm{sinc} \left( \frac{t - nT}{T} \right)
\right \}
}.&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The sinc function follows from rows 202 and 102 of the [[Table of Fourier transforms|transform tables]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The inverse transform of both sides produces the [[Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula]]''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT)\cdot \mathrm{sinc} \left( \frac{t - nT}{T}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

which shows how the samples, ''x''(''nT''), can be combined to reconstruct ''x''(''t'').

* Larger-than-necessary values of ''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' (smaller values of ''T''), called ''oversampling'', have no effect on the outcome of the reconstruction and have the benefit of leaving room for a ''transition band'' in which ''H''(''f'') is free to take intermediate values. [[Undersampling]], which causes aliasing, is not in general a reversible operation.
* Theoretically, the interpolation formula can be implemented as a [[low pass filter]], whose impulse response is sinc(''t''/''T'') and whose input is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT)\cdot \delta(t - nT),&lt;/math&gt; which is a [[Dirac comb]] function modulated by the signal samples. Practical [[digital-to-analog converter]]s (DAC) implement an approximation like the [[zero-order hold]]. In that case, oversampling can reduce the approximation error.

==Shannon's original proof==
Poisson shows that the Fourier series in {{EquationNote|Eq.1}} produces the periodic summation of &lt;math&gt;X(f)&lt;/math&gt;, regardless of &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Shannon, however, only derives the series coefficients for the case &lt;math&gt;f_s=2B&lt;/math&gt;. Virtually quoting Shannon's original paper''':'''

:Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; be the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x(t).&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; Then

::{|

|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= {1 \over 2\pi} \int_{-2\pi B}^{2\pi B} X(\omega) e^{i\omega t}\;{\rm d}\omega &lt;/math&gt;
|}

:since &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be zero outside the band &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle |\frac{\omega}{2\pi}| &lt; B&lt;/math&gt;. If we let

:On the left are values of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x(t)&lt;/math&gt; at the sampling points.

This means that the values of the samples &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x(n/2B)&lt;/math&gt; determine the Fourier coefficients in the series expansion of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X(\omega).&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; Thus they determine &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X(\omega),&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is zero for frequencies greater than ''B'', and for lower frequencies &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is determined if its Fourier coefficients are determined. But &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; determines the original function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x(t)&lt;/math&gt; completely, since a function is determined if its spectrum is known. Therefore the original samples determine the function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x(t)&lt;/math&gt; completely. 
Shannon's proof of the theorem is complete at that point, but he goes on to discuss reconstruction via [[sinc function]]s, what we now call the [[Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula]] as discussed above. He does not derive or prove the properties of the sinc function, but these would have been{{weasel inline|date=June 2017}} familiar to engineers reading his works at the time, since the Fourier pair relationship between [[rectangular function|rect]] (the rectangular function) and sinc was well known.

:Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x_n&lt;/math&gt; be the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; sample. Then the function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is represented by:

::&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}x_n{\sin \pi(2Bt-n) \over \pi(2Bt-n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

As in the other proof, the existence of the Fourier transform of the original signal is assumed, so the proof does not say whether the sampling theorem extends to bandlimited stationary random processes.

==Application to multivariable signals and images==
{{Main|Multidimensional sampling}}
[[File:Moire pattern of bricks small.jpg|thumb|right|205px|Subsampled image showing a [[Moiré pattern]] ]]

[[File:Moire pattern of bricks.jpg|thumb|right|205px|Properly sampled image]]

The sampling theorem is usually formulated for functions of a single variable. Consequently, the theorem is directly applicable to time-dependent signals and is normally formulated in that context. However, the sampling theorem can be extended in a straightforward way to functions of arbitrarily many variables. Grayscale images, for example, are often represented as two-dimensional arrays (or matrices) of real numbers representing the relative intensities of [[pixel]]s (picture elements) located at the intersections of row and column sample locations. As a result, images require two independent variables, or indices, to specify each pixel uniquely—one for the row, and one for the column.

Color images typically consist of a composite of three separate grayscale images, one to represent each of the three primary colors—red, green, and blue, or ''RGB'' for short. Other colorspaces using 3-vectors for colors include HSV, CIELAB, XYZ, etc. Some colorspaces such as cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK) may represent color by four dimensions. All of these are treated as [[vector-valued function]]s over a two-dimensional sampled domain.

Similar to one-dimensional discrete-time signals, images can also suffer from aliasing if the sampling resolution, or pixel density, is inadequate. For example, a digital photograph of a striped shirt with high frequencies (in other words, the distance between the stripes is small), can cause aliasing of the shirt when it is sampled by the camera's [[image sensor]]. The aliasing appears as a [[moiré pattern]]. The "solution" to higher sampling in the spatial domain for this case would be to move closer to the shirt, use a higher resolution sensor, or to optically blur the image before acquiring it with the sensor.

Another example is shown to the right in the brick patterns. The top image shows the effects when the sampling theorem's condition is not satisfied. When software rescales an image (the same process that creates the thumbnail shown in the lower image) it, in effect, runs the image through a low-pass filter first and then [[downsampling|downsamples]] the image to result in a smaller image that does not exhibit the [[moiré pattern]]. The top image is what happens when the image is downsampled without low-pass filtering: aliasing results.

The sampling theorem applies to camera systems, where the scene and lens constitute an analog spatial signal source, and the image sensor is a spatial sampling device.  Each of these components is characterized by a [[optical transfer function|modulation transfer function]] (MTF), representing the precise resolution (spatial bandwidth) available in that component.  Effects of aliasing or blurring can occur when the lens MTF and sensor MTF are mismatched.  When the optical image which is sampled by the sensor device contains higher spatial frequencies than the sensor, the under sampling acts as a low-pass filter to reduce or eliminate aliasing. When the area of the sampling spot (the size of the pixel sensor) is not large enough to provide sufficient [[spatial anti-aliasing]], a separate anti-aliasing filter (optical low-pass filter) may be included in a camera system to reduce the MTF of the optical image.  Instead of requiring an optical filter, the [[graphics processing unit]] of [[smartphone]] cameras performs [[digital signal processing]] to remove aliasing with a digital filter.  Digital filters also apply sharpening to amplify the contrast from the lens at high spatial frequencies, which otherwise falls off rapidly at diffraction limits.

The sampling theorem also applies to post-processing digital images, such as to up or down sampling.  Effects of aliasing, blurring, and sharpening may be adjusted with digital filtering implemented in software, which necessarily follows the theoretical principles.

==Critical frequency==
To illustrate the necessity of &lt;math&gt;f_s&gt;2B&lt;/math&gt;, consider the family of sinusoids generated by different values of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in this formula''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \frac{\cos(2 \pi B t + \theta )}{\cos(\theta )}\ = \ \cos(2 \pi B t) - \sin(2 \pi B t)\tan(\theta ), \quad -\pi/2 &lt; \theta &lt; \pi/2.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:CriticalFrequencyAliasing.svg|thumb|right|A family of sinusoids at the critical frequency, all having the same sample sequences of alternating +1 and –1. That is, they all are aliases of each other, even though their frequency is not above half the sample rate.]]

With &lt;math&gt;f_s=2B&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently &lt;math&gt;T=1/2B&lt;/math&gt;, the samples are given by''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;x(nT) = \cos(\pi n) - \underbrace{\sin(\pi n)}_{0}\tan(\theta ) = (-1)^n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;u&gt;regardless of the value of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. That sort of ambiguity is the reason for the ''strict'' inequality of the sampling theorem's condition.

==Sampling of non-baseband signals==
As discussed by Shannon:&lt;ref name="Shannon49"/&gt;

:&lt;blockquote&gt;A similar result is true if the band does not start at zero frequency but at some higher value, and can be proved by a linear translation (corresponding physically to [[single-sideband modulation]]) of the zero-frequency case. In this case the elementary pulse is obtained from sin(''x'')/''x'' by single-side-band modulation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, a sufficient no-loss condition for sampling [[signal (information theory)|signal]]s that do not have [[baseband]] components exists that involves the ''width'' of the non-zero frequency interval as opposed to its highest frequency component. See ''[[Sampling (signal processing)]]'' for more details and examples.

For example, in order to sample the [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] signals in the frequency range of 100–102&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]], it is not necessary to sample at 204&amp;nbsp;MHz (twice the upper frequency), but rather it is sufficient to sample at 4&amp;nbsp;MHz (twice the width of the frequency interval).

A bandpass condition is that ''X''(''f'') = 0, for all nonnegative ''f'' outside the open band of frequencies:

::&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{N}2f_\mathrm{s},\frac{N+1}2f_\mathrm{s}\right), &lt;/math&gt;

for some nonnegative integer ''N''. This formulation includes the normal baseband condition as the case ''N''=0.

The corresponding interpolation function is the impulse response of an ideal brick-wall [[bandpass filter]] (as opposed to the ideal [[brick-wall filter|brick-wall]] [[lowpass filter]] used above) with cutoffs at the upper and lower edges of the specified band, which is the difference between a pair of lowpass impulse responses:

::&lt;math&gt;(N+1)\,\operatorname{sinc} \left(\frac{(N+1)t}T\right) - N\,\operatorname{sinc}\left( \frac{Nt}T \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Other generalizations, for example to signals occupying multiple non-contiguous bands, are possible as well. Even the most generalized form of the sampling theorem does not have a provably true converse. That is, one cannot conclude that information is necessarily lost just because the conditions of the sampling theorem are not satisfied; from an engineering perspective, however, it is generally safe to assume that if the sampling theorem is not satisfied then information will most likely be lost.

==Nonuniform sampling==
The sampling theory of Shannon can be generalized for the case of [[nonuniform sampling]], that is, samples not taken equally spaced in time. The Shannon sampling theory for non-uniform sampling states that a band-limited signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the average sampling rate satisfies the Nyquist condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Marvasti (ed) | first =F. | title =Nonuniform Sampling, Theory and Practice | publisher =Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers | date =2000 | location =New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, although uniformly spaced samples may result in easier reconstruction algorithms, it is not a necessary condition for perfect reconstruction.

The general theory for non-baseband and nonuniform samples was developed in 1967 by [[Henry Landau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. J. |last=Landau |title=Necessary density conditions for sampling and interpolation of certain entire functions |journal=Acta Math. |volume=117 |issue=1 |pages=37–52 |year=1967 |doi=10.1007/BF02395039 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He proved that the average sampling rate (uniform or otherwise) must be twice the ''occupied'' bandwidth of the signal, assuming it is ''a priori'' known what portion of the spectrum was occupied.
In the late 1990s, this work was partially extended to cover signals of when the amount of occupied bandwidth was known, but the actual occupied portion of the spectrum was unknown.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., {{cite book |first=P. |last=Feng |title=Universal minimum-rate sampling and spectrum-blind reconstruction for multiband signals |publisher=Ph.D. dissertation, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, a complete theory was developed
(see the section [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem#Beyond Nyquist|Beyond Nyquist]] below) using [[compressed sensing]]. In particular, the theory, using signal processing language, is described in this 2009 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | citeseerx = 10.1.1.154.4255 | title = Blind Multiband Signal Reconstruction: Compressed Sensing for Analog Signals | first1 = Moshe | last1 = Mishali | first2 = Yonina C. | last2 = Eldar | journal = IEEE Trans. Signal Process. |date=March 2009 | volume = 57 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They show, among other things, that if the frequency locations are unknown, then it is necessary to sample at least at twice the Nyquist criteria; in other words, you must pay at least a factor of 2 for not knowing the location of the [[spectrum]]. Note that minimum sampling requirements do not necessarily guarantee [[Numerical stability|stability]].

==Sampling below the Nyquist rate under additional restrictions==
{{Main|Undersampling}}
The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem provides a [[necessary and sufficient condition|sufficient condition]] for the sampling and reconstruction of a band-limited signal. When reconstruction is done via the [[Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula]], the Nyquist criterion is also a necessary condition to avoid aliasing, in the sense that if samples are taken at a slower rate than twice the band limit, then there are some signals that will not be correctly reconstructed. However, if further restrictions are imposed on the signal, then the Nyquist criterion may no longer be a [[necessary and sufficient condition|necessary condition]].

A non-trivial example of exploiting extra assumptions about the signal is given by the recent field of [[compressed sensing]], which allows for full reconstruction with a sub-Nyquist sampling rate. Specifically, this applies to signals that are sparse (or compressible) in some domain. As an example, compressed sensing deals with signals that may have a low over-all bandwidth (say, the ''effective'' bandwidth ''EB''), but the frequency locations are unknown, rather than all together in a single band, so that the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem#Sampling of non-baseband signals|passband technique]] does not apply. In other words, the frequency spectrum is sparse. Traditionally, the necessary sampling rate is thus 2''B''. Using compressed sensing techniques, the signal could be perfectly reconstructed if it is sampled at a rate slightly lower than 2''EB''. With this approach, reconstruction is no longer given by a formula, but instead by the solution to a [[Linear programming|linear optimization program]].

Another example where sub-Nyquist sampling is optimal arises under the additional constraint that the samples are quantized in an optimal manner, as in a combined system of sampling and optimal [[lossy compression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kipnis|first1=Alon|last2=Goldsmith|first2=Andrea J.|last3=Eldar|first3=Yonina C.|last4=Weissman|first4=Tsachy|title=Distortion rate function of sub-Nyquist sampled Gaussian sources|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|date=January 2016|volume=62|pages=401–429|doi=10.1109/tit.2015.2485271|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.5329.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This setting is relevant in cases where the joint effect of sampling and [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] is to be considered, and can provide a lower bound for the minimal reconstruction error that can be attained in sampling and quantizing a [[random signal]]. For stationary Gaussian random signals, this lower bound is usually attained at a sub-Nyquist sampling rate, indicating that sub-Nyquist sampling is optimal for this signal model under optimal [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kipnis |first1=Alon |last2=Eldar |first2=Yonina |last3=Goldsmith |first3=Andrea |title=Analog-to-Digital Compression: A New Paradigm for Converting Signals to Bits |journal=IEEE Signal Processing Magazine |date=26 April 2018 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=16–39 |doi=10.1109/MSP.2017.2774249 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8350400/|arxiv=1801.06718 |bibcode=2018ISPM...35...16K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
The sampling theorem was implied by the work of [[Harry Nyquist]] in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Nyquist, Harry | authorlink =Harry Nyquist | title =Certain topics in telegraph transmission theory | journal =Trans.

About the same time, [[Karl Küpfmüller]] showed a similar result&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Karl |last=Küpfmüller |title=Über die Dynamik der selbsttätigen Verstärkungsregler |journal=Elektrische Nachrichtentechnik |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=459–467 |year=1928 |language=de}} [http://ict.open.ac.uk/classics/2.pdf (English translation 2005)].&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed the sinc-function impulse response of a band-limiting filter, via its integral, the step-response [[sine integral]]; this bandlimiting and reconstruction filter that is so central to the sampling theorem is sometimes referred to as a ''Küpfmüller filter'' (but seldom so in English).

The sampling theorem, essentially a [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] of Nyquist's result, was proved by [[Claude E. Shannon]].&lt;ref name="Shannon49"/&gt; [[V. A.

It was not until these articles were published that the theorem known as “Shannon’s sampling theorem” became common property among communication engineers, although Shannon himself writes that this is a fact which is common knowledge in the communication art.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[#refShannon49|Shannon 1949]], p 448.&lt;/ref&gt;  A few lines further on, however, he adds: "but in spite of its evident importance, [it] seems not to have appeared explicitly in the literature of communication theory".

===Other discoverers===

Raabe, an assistant to Küpfmüller, proved the theorem in his 1939 Ph.D. dissertation; the term ''Raabe condition'' came to be associated with the criterion for unambiguous representation (sampling rate greater than twice the bandwidth).  Meijering&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Meijering | first =Erik | title =A Chronology of Interpolation From Ancient Astronomy to Modern Signal and Image Processing | journal =Proc. IEEE | volume =90 | issue =3 | pages =319–342 | date =March 2002 | doi =10.1109/5.993400 | url =http://bigwww.epfl.ch/publications/meijering0201.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; mentions several other discoverers and names in a paragraph and pair of footnotes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As pointed out by Higgins [135], the sampling theorem should really be considered in two parts, as done above: the first stating the fact that a bandlimited function is completely determined by its samples, the second describing how to reconstruct the function using its samples. Both parts of the sampling theorem were given in a somewhat different form by J. M. Whittaker [350, 351, 353] and before him also by Ogura [241, 242]. They were probably not aware of the fact that the first part of the theorem had been stated as early as 1897 by Borel [25].&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; As we have seen, Borel also used around that time what became known as the cardinal series. However, he appears not to have made the link [135]. In later years it became known that the sampling theorem had been presented before Shannon to the Russian communication community by Kotel'nikov [173]. In more implicit, verbal form, it had also been described in the German literature by Raabe [257]. Several authors [33, 205] have mentioned that Someya [296] introduced the theorem in the Japanese literature parallel to Shannon. In the English literature, Weston [347] introduced it independently of Shannon around the same time.&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; Several authors, following Black [16], have claimed that this first part of the sampling theorem was stated even earlier by Cauchy, in a paper [41] published in 1841. However, the paper of Cauchy does not contain such a statement, as has been pointed out by Higgins [135].

&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; As a consequence of the discovery of the several independent introductions of the sampling theorem, people started to refer to the theorem by including the names of the aforementioned authors, resulting in such catchphrases as “the Whittaker–Kotel’nikov–Shannon (WKS) sampling theorem" [155] or even "the Whittaker–Kotel'nikov–Raabe–Shannon–Someya sampling theorem" [33]. To avoid confusion, perhaps the best thing to do is to refer to it as the sampling theorem, "rather than trying to find a title that does justice to all claimants" [136].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Why Nyquist?===
Exactly how, when, or why [[Harry Nyquist]] had his name attached to the sampling theorem remains obscure. The term ''Nyquist Sampling Theorem'' (capitalized thus) appeared as early as 1959 in a book from his former employer, [[Bell Labs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Transmission Systems for Communications | author = Members of the Technical Staff of Bell Telephone Lababoratories | year = 1959 | publisher = AT&amp;T | pages = 26–4 (Vol.2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared again in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Theory of Linear Physical Systems | publisher = Wiley | year = 1963 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jtI-AAAAIAAJ |first=Ernst Adolph |last=Guillemin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not capitalized in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard A. |last=Roberts |first2=Ben F. |last2=Barton |title=Theory of Signal Detectability: Composite Deferred Decision Theory |year=1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been called the ''Shannon Sampling Theorem'' as early as 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Truman S. |last=Gray |title=Applied Electronics: A First Course in Electronics, Electron Tubes, and Associated Circuits |year=1954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also just ''the sampling theorem'' by several other books in the early 1950s.

In 1958, Blackman and Tukey cited Nyquist's 1928 article as a reference for ''the sampling theorem of information theory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. B. |last=Blackman |first2=J. W. |last2=Tukey |title=The Measurement of Power Spectra : From the Point of View of Communications Engineering |location=New York |publisher=Dover |year=1958|url=http://alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol37-1958/articles/bstj37-1-185.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though that article does not treat sampling and reconstruction of continuous signals as others did. Their glossary of terms includes these entries:
; Sampling theorem (of information theory): Nyquist's result that equi-spaced data, with two or more points per cycle of highest frequency, allows reconstruction of band-limited functions. (See ''Cardinal theorem''.)
; Cardinal theorem (of interpolation theory): A precise statement of the conditions under which values given at a doubly infinite set of equally spaced points can be interpolated to yield a continuous band-limited function with the aid of the function
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin (x - x_i)}{x - x_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

Exactly what "Nyquist's result" they are referring to remains mysterious.

When Shannon stated and proved the sampling theorem in his 1949 article, according to Meijering,&lt;ref name="EM" /&gt; "he referred to the critical sampling interval &lt;math&gt;T = \frac 1 {2W}&lt;/math&gt; as the ''Nyquist interval'' corresponding to the band ''W'', in recognition of Nyquist’s discovery of the fundamental importance of this interval in connection with telegraphy". This explains Nyquist's name on the critical interval, but not on the theorem.

Similarly, Nyquist's name was attached to ''[[Nyquist rate]]'' in 1953 by [[Harold Stephen Black|Harold S. Black]]:

{{quote|"If the essential frequency range is limited to ''B'' cycles per second, 2''B'' was given by Nyquist as the maximum number of code elements per second that could be unambiguously resolved, assuming the peak interference is less half a quantum step. This rate is generally referred to as '''signaling at the Nyquist rate''' and &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {2B}&lt;/math&gt; has been termed a ''Nyquist interval''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Harold S. |last=Black |title=Modulation Theory |year=1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (bold added for emphasis; italics as in the original)}}

According to the [[OED]], this may be the origin of the term ''Nyquist rate''. In Black's usage, it is not a sampling rate, but a signaling rate.

In [[geometry]], the '''order-4 heptagonal tiling''' is a [[List_of_regular_polytopes#Hyperbolic_tilings|regular]] tiling of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]. It has [[Schläfli symbol]] of {7,4}.

== Symmetry ==
This tiling represents a hyperbolic [[kaleidoscope]] of 7 mirrors meeting as edges of a regular heptagon. This symmetry by [[orbifold notation]] is called *2222222 with 7 order-2 mirror intersections. In [[Coxeter notation]] can be represented as [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,7,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4], removing two of three mirrors (passing through the heptagon center) in the [7,4] symmetry.

The kaleidoscopic domains can be seen as bicolored heptagons, representing mirror images of the fundamental domain. This coloring represents the uniform tiling t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;{7,7} and as a [[quasiregular tiling]] is called a ''heptaheptagonal tiling''.

In [[mathematics]], '''Paley graphs''' are [[Dense graph|dense]] [[undirected graph]]s constructed from the members of a suitable [[finite field]] by connecting pairs of elements that differ by a [[quadratic residue]]. The Paley graphs form an infinite family of [[conference graph]]s, which yield an infinite family of symmetric [[conference matrix|conference matrices]]. Paley graphs allow [[graph-theoretic]] tools to be applied to the [[number theory]] of quadratic residues, and have interesting properties that make them useful in graph theory more generally.

Paley graphs are named after [[Raymond Paley]].  They are closely related to the [[Paley construction]] for constructing [[Hadamard matrix|Hadamard matrices]] from quadratic residues {{harv|Paley|1933}}.
They were introduced as graphs independently by {{harvtxt|Sachs|1962}} and {{harvtxt|Erdős|Rényi|1963}}. [[Horst Sachs|Sachs]] was interested in them for their self-complementarity properties, while [[Paul Erdős|Erdős]] and [[Alfréd Rényi|Rényi]] studied their symmetries.

'''Paley digraphs''' are [[directed graph|directed]] analogs of Paley graphs that yield antisymmetric [[conference matrix|conference matrices]]. They were introduced by {{harvtxt|Graham|Spencer|1971}} (independently of Sachs, Erdős, and Rényi) as a way of constructing [[tournament (graph theory)|tournaments]] with a property previously known to be held only by random tournaments: in a Paley digraph, every small [[subset]] of vertices is dominated by some other vertex.

== Definition ==
Let ''q'' be a [[prime power]] such that ''q'' = 1 (mod 4). That is, ''q'' should either be an arbitrary power of a [[Pythagorean prime]] (a prime congruent to 1&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;4) or an even power of an odd non-Pythagorean prime. This choice of ''q'' implies that in the unique finite field '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; of order ''q'', the element &amp;nbsp;−1 has a square root.

Now let ''V'' = '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; and let

:&lt;math&gt;E= \left \{\{a,b\} \ : \ a-b\in (\mathbf{F}_q^{\times})^2 \right \}&lt;/math&gt;.
If a pair {''a'',''b''} is included in ''E'', it is included under either ordering of its two elements. For, ''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b'' =&amp;nbsp;−(''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''), and &amp;nbsp;−1 is a square, from which it follows that ''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b'' is a square [[if and only if]] ''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a'' is a square.

By definition ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'') is the Paley graph of order&amp;nbsp;''q''.

== Example ==
For ''q'' = 13, the field '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; is just integer arithmetic modulo 13.  The numbers with square roots mod 13 are:
* ±1 (square roots ±1 for +1, ±5 for &amp;minus;1)
* ±3 (square roots ±4 for +3, ±6 for &amp;minus;3)
* ±4 (square roots ±2 for +4, ±3 for &amp;minus;4).
Thus, in the Paley graph, we form a vertex for each of the integers in the range [0,12], and connect each such integer ''x'' to six neighbors: ''x''&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;13), ''x''&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;13), and ''x''&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;13).

== Properties ==
* The Paley graphs are [[Self-complementary graph|self-complementary]]: the complement of any Paley graph is isomorphic to it, e.g. via the mapping that takes a vertex ''x'' to ''xk''&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''q''), where ''k'' is any nonresidue mod&amp;nbsp;''q'' {{harv|Sachs|1962}}.
* These graphs are [[strongly regular graph]]s with parameters 
::&lt;math&gt;srg \left (q, \tfrac{1}{2}(q-1),\tfrac{1}{4}(q-5),\tfrac{1}{4}(q-1) \right ).&lt;/math&gt;
:In addition, Paley graphs form an infinite family of [[conference graph]]s.

* The eigenvalues of Paley graphs are &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}(q-1)&lt;/math&gt; (with multiplicity 1) and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2} (-1 \pm \sqrt{q})&lt;/math&gt; (both with multiplicity &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}(q-1)&lt;/math&gt;) and can be calculated using the [[quadratic Gauss sum]].
* If q is prime, bounds on the [[Cheeger constant (graph theory)|isoperimetric number]] ''i''(''G'') are:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{q-\sqrt{q}}{4}\leq i(G) \leq \sqrt { \left (q+\sqrt{q} \right ) \left (\frac{q-\sqrt{q}}{2} \right ) }.&lt;/math&gt;
* When ''q'' is prime, its Paley graph is a [[Hamiltonian cycle|Hamiltonian]] [[circulant graph]].
* Paley graphs are ''quasi-random'' (Chung et al. 1989): the number of times each possible constant-order graph occurs as a subgraph of a Paley graph is (in the limit for large ''q'') the same as for random graphs, and large sets of vertices have approximately the same number of edges as they would in random graphs.

== Applications ==
* The Paley graph of order 13 has [[book thickness]] 4 and [[queue number]] 3 {{harv|Wolz|2018}}.
* The Paley graph of order 17 is the unique largest graph ''G'' such that neither ''G'' nor its complement contains a complete 4-vertex subgraph (Evans et al. 1981).  It follows that the [[Ramsey theory|Ramsey number]] ''R''(4,&amp;nbsp;4)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;18.
* The Paley graph of order 101 is currently the largest known graph ''G'' such that neither ''G'' nor its complement contains a complete 6-vertex subgraph.
* Sasukara et al. (1993) use Paley graphs to generalize the construction of the [[Horrocks–Mumford bundle]].

==Paley digraphs==
Let ''q'' be a [[prime power]] such that ''q'' = 3 (mod 4). Thus, the finite field of order ''q'', '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, has no square root of &amp;minus;1.  Consequently, for each pair (''a'',''b'') of distinct elements of '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, either ''a'' − ''b'' or ''b'' − ''a'', but not both, is a square.  The '''Paley digraph''' is the [[directed graph]] with vertex set ''V'' = '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; and arc set 
:&lt;math&gt;A = \left \{(a,b)\in \mathbf{F}_q\times\mathbf{F}_q \ : \ b-a\in (\mathbf{F}_q^{\times})^2 \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Paley digraph is a [[tournament (graph theory)|tournament]] because each pair of distinct vertices is linked by an arc in one and only one direction.

The Paley digraph leads to the construction of some antisymmetric [[conference matrix|conference matrices]] and [[biplane geometries]].

== Genus ==
The six neighbors of each vertex in the Paley graph of order 13 are connected in a cycle; that is, the graph is [[Neighborhood (graph theory)|locally cyclic]]. Therefore, this graph can be embedded as a [[Triangulation (topology)|Whitney triangulation]] of a [[torus]], in which every face is a triangle and every triangle is a face.  More generally, if any Paley graph of order ''q'' could be embedded so that all its faces are triangles, we could calculate the genus of the resulting surface via the [[Euler characteristic]] as &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{24}(q^2 - 13q + 24)&lt;/math&gt;. {{harvs|authorlink=Bojan Mohar|last=Mohar|year=2005|txt}} conjectures that the minimum genus of a surface into which a Paley graph can be embedded is near this bound in the case that ''q'' is a square, and questions whether such a bound might hold more generally. Specifically, Mohar conjectures that the Paley graphs of square order can be embedded into surfaces with genus
:&lt;math&gt;(q^2 - 13q + 24)\left(\tfrac{1}{24} + o(1)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where the o(1) term can be any function of ''q'' that goes to zero in the limit as ''q'' goes to infinity.

{{harvtxt|White|2001}} finds embeddings of the Paley graphs of order ''q''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;8) that are highly symmetric and self-dual, generalizing a natural embedding of the Paley graph of order 9 as a 3×3 square grid on a torus. However the genus of White's embeddings is higher by approximately a factor of three than Mohar's conjectured bound.

In [[geometry]], '''Plücker coordinates''', introduced by [[Julius Plücker]] in the 19th century, are a way to assign six [[homogeneous coordinates]] to each [[line (mathematics)|line]] in [[projective space|projective 3-space]], '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Because they satisfy a quadratic constraint, they establish a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the 4-dimensional space of lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and points on a [[quadric (projective geometry)|quadric]] in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (projective 5-space). A predecessor and special case of [[Grassmann coordinates]] (which describe ''k''-dimensional linear subspaces, or ''flats'', in an ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]), Plücker coordinates arise naturally in [[geometric algebra]]. They have proved useful for [[computer graphics]], and also can be extended to coordinates for the [[screw theory|screws and wrenches]] in the theory of [[kinematics]] used for [[robot control]].

== Geometric intuition ==
[[File:Plücker line coordinate geometry.png|thumb|right|Displacement and moment of two points on line]]
A line ''L'' in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is determined by two distinct points that it contains, or by two distinct planes that contain it. Consider the first case, with points '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''''y'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The vector displacement from '''''x''''' to '''''y''''' is nonzero because the points are distinct, and represents the ''direction'' of the line. That is, every displacement between points on ''L'' is a scalar multiple of '''''d'''''&amp;nbsp;= '''''y'''''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;'''''x'''''. If a physical particle of unit mass were to move from '''''x''''' to '''''y''''', it would have a [[moment (physics)|moment]] about the origin. The geometric equivalent is a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane containing ''L'' and the origin, and whose length equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the displacement and the origin. Treating the points as displacements from the origin, the moment is '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= '''''x'''''×'''''y''''', where "×" denotes the vector [[cross product]]. For a fixed line, ''L'', the area of the triangle is proportional to the length of the segment between '''''x''''' and '''''y''''', considered as the base of the triangle; it is not changed by sliding the base along the line, parallel to itself. By definition the moment vector is perpendicular to every displacement along the line, so '''''d'''''•'''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= 0, where "•" denotes the vector [[dot product]].

Although neither '''''d''''' nor '''''m''''' alone is sufficient to determine ''L'', together the pair does so uniquely, up to a common (nonzero) scalar multiple which depends on the distance between '''''x''''' and '''''y'''''. That is, the coordinates

: ('''''d''''':'''''m''''') = (''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''d''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)

may be considered [[homogeneous coordinates]] for ''L'', in the sense that all pairs (''λ'''d''''':''λ'''m'''''), for ''λ''&amp;nbsp;≠ 0, can be produced by points on ''L'' and only ''L'', and any such pair determines a unique line so long as '''''d''''' is not zero and '''''d'''''•'''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= 0. Furthermore, this approach extends to include [[point at infinity|points]], [[line at infinity|lines]], and a [[plane at infinity|plane]] "at infinity", in the sense of [[projective geometry]].

: '''Example.''' Let '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;= (2,3,7) and '''''y'''''&amp;nbsp;= (2,1,0). Then ('''''d''''':'''''m''''')&amp;nbsp;= (0:−2:−7:−7:14:−4).

Alternatively, let the equations for points '''''x''''' of two distinct planes containing ''L'' be

: 0 = ''a'' + '''''a'''''•'''''x'''''
: 0 = ''b'' + '''''b'''''•'''''x''''' .

Then their respective planes are perpendicular to vectors '''''a''''' and '''''b''''', and the direction of ''L'' must be perpendicular to both. Hence we may set '''''d'''''&amp;nbsp;= '''''a'''''×'''''b''''', which is nonzero because '''''a''''' and '''''b''''' are neither zero nor parallel (the planes being distinct and intersecting). If point '''''x''''' satisfies both plane equations, then it also satisfies the linear combination

:{|
|-
| 0 || = ''a'' (''b'' + '''''b'''''•'''''x''''') − ''b'' (''a'' + '''''a'''''•'''''x''''')
|-
| || = (''a'' '''''b''''' − ''b'' '''''a''''')•'''''x''''' .
|}

That is, '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= ''a''&amp;nbsp;'''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;'''''a''''' is a vector perpendicular to displacements to points on ''L'' from the origin; it is, in fact, a moment consistent with the '''''d''''' previously defined from '''''a''''' and '''''b'''''.

proof：need to show '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= ''a''&amp;nbsp;'''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;'''''a = r×d = r× a×b, let  a•a = b•b = 1'''''
[[File:BaiduShurufa 2018-9-29 20-38-43.png|thumb|plane orthogonal to the line and include the origin]]
point B is the origin.  the line is pass point D and orthogonal to the plane, the 2 plane pass CD and DE both orthogonal to the plane, BD is diameter

: '''''a ='''''  BE/ ||BE||,  '''''b =''''' BC/ ||BC||，'''''r''''' = BD,  −a = ||BF|| = ||BE||，−b = ||BG|| = ||BC||, '''''m'''''= a'''''b'''''−b'''''a =''''' FG,  ||'''''d''&amp;nbsp;|| = || ''a''×''b'' ||''' = sin(FBG)

angle BCE = BDE = BGF, so points D,G,E,H on a circle, and angle GHG is right angle, FG orthogonal to BD, so 4 points C, D, H, F on a circle, and 

||BF||&amp;nbsp;||BC|| = ||BH||&amp;nbsp;||BD||, that is ''ab''&amp;nbsp;sin(FBG) = ||BH||&amp;nbsp;||'''''r'''''||&amp;nbsp;sin(FBG), 2&amp;middot;area of triangle BFG = ''ab''&amp;middot;sin(FBG) =  ||BH||&amp;nbsp;||FG|| = ||BH||&amp;nbsp;||'''''r'''''||&amp;nbsp;sin(FBG), 
||'''''m'''''|| = ||FG|| = ||'''''r'''''||&amp;nbsp;sin(FBG) = ||'''''r'''''||&amp;nbsp;||'''''d&amp;nbsp;||,''''' check direction and '''''m = r''×''d.'''''

when ||'''''r'''''|| = 0, the line is the one pass origin with direction '''''d'''''; if ||'''''r'''''|| &gt; 0,  the line is with direction '''''d,''''' the plane including the origin and the line has normal vector '''''m''''', the line is tangent to a circle on the plane centered origin and with radius ||''r''|| at point '''''r'''''.

: '''Example.''' Let ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 2, '''''a'''''&amp;nbsp;= (−1,0,0) and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= −7, '''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;= (0,7,−2). Then ('''''d''''':'''''m''''')&amp;nbsp;= (0:−2:−7:−7:14:−4).

Although the usual algebraic definition tends to obscure the relationship, ('''''d''''':'''''m''''') are the Plücker coordinates of ''L''.

== Algebraic definition ==

=== Primal coordinates ===
In a 3-dimensional projective space '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, let ''L'' be a line through distinct points '''x''' and '''y''' with [[homogeneous coordinates]] (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).
The Plücker coordinates ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are defined as follows:
:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;p_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; {}= \begin{vmatrix} x_{i} &amp; y_{i} \\ x_{j} &amp; y_{j}\end{vmatrix} = x_{i}y_{j}-x_{j}y_{i} . &lt;/math&gt;
|}
This implies ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ii''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0 and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= −''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt;, reducing the possibilities to only six (4 [[binomial coefficient|choose]] 2) independent quantities. The sixtuple

: &lt;math&gt;(p_{01}:p_{02}:p_{03}:p_{23}:p_{31}:p_{12}) &lt;/math&gt;

is uniquely determined by ''L'' up to a common nonzero scale factor. Furthermore, not all six components can be zero.
Thus the Plücker coordinates of ''L'' may be considered as homogeneous coordinates of a point in a 5-dimensional projective space, as suggested by the colon notation.

To see these facts, let ''M'' be the 4×2 matrix with the point coordinates as columns.

: &lt;math&gt; M = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 &amp;  y_0 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 \\ x_3 &amp; y_3 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The Plücker coordinate ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is the determinant of rows ''i'' and ''j'' of ''M''.
Because '''x''' and '''y''' are distinct points, the columns of ''M'' are [[linear independence|linearly independent]]; ''M'' has [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] 2. Let ''M&amp;prime;'' be a second matrix, with columns '''x&amp;prime;''' and '''y&amp;prime;''' a different pair of distinct points on ''L''. Then the columns of ''M&amp;prime;'' are [[linear combination]]s of the columns of ''M''; so for some 2×2 [[nonsingular matrix]] Λ,

: &lt;math&gt; M' = M\Lambda . &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, rows ''i'' and ''j'' of ''M&amp;prime;'' and ''M'' are related by

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} x'_{i} &amp; y'_{i}\\x'_{j}&amp; y'_{j} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{i} &amp; y_{i}\\x_{j}&amp; y_{j} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_{00} &amp; \lambda_{01} \\ \lambda_{10} &amp; \lambda_{11} \end{bmatrix} . &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the determinant of the left side 2×2 matrix equals the product of the determinants of the right side 2×2 matrices, the latter of which is a fixed scalar, det&amp;nbsp;Λ. Furthermore, all six 2×2 subdeterminants in ''M'' cannot be zero because the rank of ''M'' is 2.

=== Plücker map ===
Denote the set of all lines (linear images of '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1,3&lt;/sub&gt;.  We thus have a map:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\alpha \colon \mathrm{G}_{1,3} &amp; \rightarrow \mathbf{P}^5 \\
L &amp; \mapsto L^{\alpha},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; L^{\alpha}=(p_{01}:p_{02}:p_{03}:p_{23}:p_{31}:p_{12}) . &lt;/math&gt;

=== Dual coordinates ===
Alternatively, a line can be described as the intersection of two planes. Let ''L'' 
be a line contained in distinct planes '''a''' and '''b''' with homogeneous coefficients (''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and (''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:''b''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:''b''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. (The first plane equation is ∑&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;=0, for example.) The dual Plücker coordinate ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''ij''&lt;/sup&gt; is

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;p^{ij} &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; {}= \begin{vmatrix} a^{i} &amp; a^{j} \\ b^{i} &amp; b^{j}\end{vmatrix}  = a^{i}b^{j}-a^{j}b^{i} . &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Dual coordinates are convenient in some computations, and they are equivalent to primary coordinates:
: &lt;math&gt;
(p_{01}:p_{02}:p_{03}:p_{23}:p_{31}:p_{12})=
(p^{23}:p^{31}:p^{12}:p^{01}:p^{02}:p^{03})
&lt;/math&gt;
Here, equality between the two vectors in homogeneous coordinates means that the numbers on the right side are equal to the numbers on the left side up to some common scaling factor &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Specifically, let (''i'',''j'',''k'',''ℓ'') be an [[even permutation]] of (0,1,2,3); then

: &lt;math&gt;p_{ij} = \lambda p^{k\ell} .  &lt;/math&gt;

=== Geometry ===
To relate back to the geometric intuition, take ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0 as the plane at infinity; thus the coordinates of points ''not'' at infinity can be normalized so that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1. Then ''M'' becomes

: &lt;math&gt; M = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;  1 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 \\ x_2&amp; y_2 \\ x_3 &amp; y_3 \end{bmatrix} , &lt;/math&gt;

and setting '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''''y'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), we have '''''d'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''p''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''p''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;).

Dually, we have '''''d'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''p''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) and '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''p''&lt;sup&gt;01&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sup&gt;02&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sup&gt;03&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Bijection between lines and Klein quadric==
=== Plane equations ===
If the point '''z'''&amp;nbsp;= (''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) lies on ''L'', then the columns of

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} x_0 &amp; y_0 &amp; z_0 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \\ x_3 &amp; y_3 &amp; z_3 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

are [[linearly dependent]], so that the rank of this larger matrix is still 2. This implies that all 3×3 submatrices have determinant zero, generating four (4 choose 3) plane equations, such as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = \begin{vmatrix} x_0 &amp; y_0 &amp; z_0 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \end{vmatrix} \\[5pt]
&amp; = \begin{vmatrix} x_1 &amp; y_1 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 \end{vmatrix} z_0 - \begin{vmatrix} x_0 &amp; y_0 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 \end{vmatrix} z_1 + \begin{vmatrix} x_0 &amp; y_0 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 \end{vmatrix} z_2 \\[5pt]
&amp; = p_{12} z_0 - p_{02} z_1 + p_{01} z_2 . \\[5pt]
&amp; = p^{03} z_0 + p^{13} z_1 + p^{23} z_2 .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The four possible planes obtained are as follows.

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{matrix}
0 &amp; = &amp; {}+ p_{12} z_0 &amp; {}- p_{02} z_1 &amp; {}+ p_{01} z_2 &amp; \\
0 &amp; = &amp; {}- p_{31} z_0 &amp; {}- p_{03} z_1 &amp; &amp; {}+ p_{01} z_3 \\
0 &amp; = &amp; {}+p_{23} z_0 &amp; &amp; {}- p_{03} z_2 &amp; {}+ p_{02} z_3 \\
0 &amp; = &amp; &amp; {}+p_{23} z_1 &amp; {}+ p_{31} z_2 &amp; {}+ p_{12} z_3
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Using dual coordinates, and letting (''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) be the line coefficients, each of these is simply ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''ij''&lt;/sup&gt;, or

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = \sum_{i=0}^3 p^{ij} z_i , \qquad j = 0,\ldots,3 . &lt;/math&gt;

Each Plücker coordinate appears in two of the four equations, each time multiplying a different variable; and as at least one of the coordinates is nonzero, we are guaranteed non-vacuous equations for two distinct planes intersecting in ''L''. Thus the Plücker coordinates of a line determine that line uniquely, and the map α is an [[Injective function|injection]].

=== Quadratic relation ===
The image of α is not the complete set of points in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;; the Plücker coordinates of a line ''L'' satisfy the quadratic Plücker relation

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = p_{01}p^{01}+p_{02}p^{02}+p_{03}p^{03} \\
&amp; = p_{01}p_{23}+p_{02}p_{31}+p_{03}p_{12}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For proof, write this homogeneous polynomial as determinants and use [[Laplace expansion]] (in reverse).

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = \begin{vmatrix}x_0&amp;y_0\\x_1&amp;y_1\end{vmatrix}\begin{vmatrix}x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}+
\begin{vmatrix}x_0&amp;y_0\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix}\begin{vmatrix}x_3&amp;y_3\\x_1&amp;y_1\end{vmatrix}+
\begin{vmatrix}x_0&amp;y_0\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix} \\[5pt]
&amp; = (x_0 y_1-y_0 x_1)\begin{vmatrix}x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}-
(x_0 y_2-y_0 x_2)\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}+
(x_0 y_3-y_0 x_3)\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix} \\[5pt]
&amp; = x_0 \left(y_1\begin{vmatrix}x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}-
y_2\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}+
y_3\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix}\right)
-y_0 \left(x_1\begin{vmatrix}x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}-
x_2\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}+
x_3\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix}\right) \\[5pt]
&amp; = x_0 \begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}
-y_0 \begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since both 3×3 determinants have duplicate columns, the right hand side is identically zero.

Another proof may be done like this:
Since vector

: &lt;math&gt; d = \left( p_{01}, p_{02}, p_{03} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

is perpendicular to vector

: &lt;math&gt; m = \left( p_{23}, p_{31}, p_{12} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

(see above), the scalar product of ''d'' and ''m'' must be zero! q.e.d.

=== Point equations ===
Letting (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) be the point coordinates, four possible points on a line each have coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''j''&amp;nbsp;= 0…3. Some of these possible points may be inadmissible because all coordinates are zero, but since at least one Plücker coordinate is nonzero, at least two distinct points are guaranteed.

=== Bijectivity ===
If (''q''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) are the homogeneous coordinates of a point in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, without loss of generality assume that ''q''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; is nonzero. Then the matrix

: &lt;math&gt; M = \begin{bmatrix} q_{01} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; q_{01} \\ -q_{12} &amp; q_{02} \\ q_{31} &amp; q_{03} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

has rank 2, and so its columns are distinct points defining a line ''L''. When the '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; coordinates, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, satisfy the quadratic Plücker relation, they are the Plücker coordinates of ''L''. To see this, first normalize ''q''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; to 1. Then we immediately have that for the Plücker coordinates computed from ''M'', ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, except for

: &lt;math&gt; p_{23} = - q_{03} q_{12} - q_{02} q_{31} . &lt;/math&gt;

But if the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy the Plücker relation ''q''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;+''q''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;+''q''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0, then ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''23''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''23''&lt;/sub&gt;, completing the set of identities.

Consequently, α is a [[surjection]] onto the [[algebraic variety]] consisting of the set of zeros of the quadratic polynomial

: &lt;math&gt; p_{01}p_{23}+p_{02}p_{31}+p_{03}p_{12} . &lt;/math&gt;

And since α is also an injection, the lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are thus in [[bijection|bijective]] correspondence with the points of this [[quadric]] in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, called the Plücker quadric or [[Klein quadric]].

==Uses==
Plücker coordinates allow concise solutions to problems of line geometry in 3-dimensional space, especially those involving [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]].

=== Line-line crossing ===
Two lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are either [[skew lines|skew]] or [[coplanar]], and in the latter case they are either coincident or intersect in a unique point. If ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are the Plücker coordinates of two lines, then they are coplanar precisely when '''''d'''''⋅'''''m'''''&amp;prime;+'''''m'''''⋅'''''d'''''&amp;prime;&amp;nbsp;= 0, as shown by

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = p_{01}p'_{23} + p_{02}p'_{31} + p_{03}p'_{12} + p_{23}p'_{01} + p_{31}p'_{02} + p_{12}p'_{03} \\[5pt]
&amp; = \begin{vmatrix}x_0&amp;y_0&amp;x'_0&amp;y'_0\\
x_1&amp;y_1&amp;x'_1&amp;y'_1\\
x_2&amp;y_2&amp;x'_2&amp;y'_2\\
x_3&amp;y_3&amp;x'_3&amp;y'_3\end{vmatrix}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

When the lines are skew, the sign of the result indicates the sense of crossing: positive if a right-handed screw takes ''L'' into ''L''&amp;prime;, else negative.

The quadratic Plücker relation essentially states that a line is coplanar with itself.

=== Line-line join ===
In the event that two lines are coplanar but not parallel, their common plane has equation

: 0 = ('''''m'''''•'''''d'''''&amp;prime;)''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ('''''d'''''×'''''d'''''&amp;prime;)•'''''x''''' ,

where '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

The slightest perturbation will destroy the existence of a common plane, and near-parallelism of the lines will cause numeric difficulties in finding such a plane even if it does exist.

=== Line-line meet ===
Dually, two coplanar lines, neither of which contains the origin, have common point

: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : '''''x''''') = ('''d'''•'''m'''&amp;prime;:'''m'''×'''m'''&amp;prime;) .

To handle lines not meeting this restriction, see the references.

=== Plane-line meet ===
Given a plane with equation

: &lt;math&gt; 0 =  a^0x_0 + a^1x_1 + a^2x_2 + a^3x_3 , &lt;/math&gt;

or more concisely 0&amp;nbsp;= ''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+'''''a'''''•'''''x'''''; and given a line not in it with Plücker coordinates ('''''d''''':'''''m'''''), then their point of intersection is

: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : '''''x''''') = ('''''a'''''•'''''d''''' : '''''a'''''×'''''m''''' − ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''''d''''') .

The point coordinates, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), can also be expressed in terms of Plücker coordinates as

: &lt;math&gt; x_i = \sum_{j \ne i} a^j p_{ij} , \qquad i = 0 \ldots 3 . &lt;/math&gt;

=== Point-line join ===
Dually, given a point (''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:'''''y''''') and a line not containing it, their common plane has equation

: 0 = ('''''y'''''•'''''m''''') ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ('''''y'''''×'''''d'''''−''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''''m''''')•'''''x''''' .

The plane coordinates, (''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), can also be expressed in terms of dual Plücker coordinates as

: &lt;math&gt; a^i = \sum_{j \ne i} y_j p^{ij} , \qquad i = 0 \ldots 3 . &lt;/math&gt;

=== Line families ===
Because the [[Klein quadric]] is in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, it contains linear subspaces of dimensions one and two (but no higher). These correspond to one- and two-parameter families of lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

For example, suppose ''L'' and ''L''&amp;prime; are distinct lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; determined by points '''x''', '''y''' and '''x'''&amp;prime;, '''y'''&amp;prime;, respectively. Linear combinations of their determining points give linear combinations of their Plücker coordinates, generating a one-parameter family of lines containing ''L'' and ''L''&amp;prime;. This corresponds to a one-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.

==== Lines in plane ====
If three distinct and non-parallel lines are coplanar; their linear combinations generate a two-parameter family of lines, all the lines in the plane. This corresponds to a two-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.

==== Lines through point ====
If three distinct and non-coplanar lines intersect in a point, their linear combinations generate a two-parameter family of lines, all the lines through the point. This also corresponds to a two-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.

==== Ruled surface ====
A [[ruled surface]] is a family of lines that is not necessarily linear. It corresponds to a curve on the Klein quadric. For example, a [[hyperboloid of one sheet]] is a quadric surface in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ruled by two different families of lines, one line of each passing through each point of the surface; each family corresponds under the Plücker map to a [[conic section]] within the Klein quadric in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Line geometry ===
During the nineteenth century, ''line geometry'' was studied intensively. In terms of the bijection given above, this is a description of the intrinsic geometry of the Klein quadric.

==== Ray tracing ====
Line geometry is extensively used in [[Ray_tracing_(graphics)|ray tracing]] application where the geometry and intersections of rays need to be calculated in 3D. An implementation is described in
[http://www.flipcode.com/archives/Introduction_To_Plcker_Coordinates.shtml Introduction to Plücker Coordinates] written for the Ray Tracing forum by Thouis Jones.

In [[mathematics]], especially in the field of [[algebra]], a '''polynomial ring''' or '''polynomial algebra''' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] (which is also a [[commutative algebra]]) formed from the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[polynomial]]s in one or more [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]]s (traditionally also called [[variable (mathematics)|variables]]) with coefficients in another [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], often a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. 

Polynomial rings occur in many parts of mathematics, and the study of their properties was among the main motivations for the development of [[commutative algebra]] and [[ring theory]]. Polynomial rings and their [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] are fundamental in [[algebraic geometry]]. Many classes of rings, such as [[unique factorization domain]]s, [[regular ring]]s, [[group ring]]s, [[formal power series|rings of formal power series]], [[Ore polynomial]]s, [[graded ring]]s, are generalizations of polynomial rings.

A closely related notion is that of the [[ring of polynomial functions]] on a [[vector space]], and, more generally, [[ring of regular functions]] on an [[algebraic variety]].

== The polynomial ring ''K''[''X''] ==

=== Definition ===
The '''polynomial ring''', ''K''[''X''], in ''X'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is defined&lt;ref&gt;Herstein p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; as the set of expressions, called '''polynomials''' in ''X'', of the form

:&lt;math&gt;p = p_0 + p_1 X + p_2 X^2 + \cdots + p_{m - 1} X^{m - 1} + p_m X^m,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, the '''coefficients''' of ''p'', are elements of ''K'', and ''X'', ''X''{{i sup|2}}, are symbols, which are considered as "powers of ''X''", and, by convention, follow the usual rules of [[exponentiation]]: {{nowrap|1=''X''{{i sup|0}} = 1}}, {{nowrap|1=''X''{{i sup|1}} = ''X''}}, and &lt;math&gt; X^k\, X^l = X^{k+l}&lt;/math&gt; for any [[nonnegative integer]]s ''k'' and ''l''. The symbol ''X'' is called an indeterminate&lt;ref&gt;Herstein, Hall p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; or variable.&lt;ref&gt;Lang p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Two polynomials are defined to be equal when the corresponding coefficient of each ''X''{{i sup|''k''}} is equal.

This terminology is suggested by [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] ''polynomial functions''. However, in general, ''X'' and its powers, ''X''{{i sup|''k''}}, are treated as formal symbols, not as elements of the field ''K'' or functions over it. One can think of the ring ''K''[''X''] as arising from ''K'' by adding one new element ''X'' that is external to ''K'' and requiring that ''X'' commute with all elements of ''K''.

The polynomial ring in ''X'' over ''K'' is equipped with an addition, a multiplication and a [[scalar multiplication]] that make it a [[Commutative algebra (structure)|commutative algebra]]. These operations are defined according to the ordinary rules for manipulating algebraic expressions. Specifically, if 
:&lt;math&gt;p = p_0 + p_1 X + p_2 X^2 + \cdots + p_m X^m,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;q = q_0 + q_1 X + q_2 X^2 + \cdots + q_n X^n,&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;p + q = r_0 + r_1 X + r_2 X^2 + \cdots + r_k X^k,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;pq = s_0 + s_1 X + s_2 X^2 + \cdots + s_l X^l,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k'' = max(''m'', ''n''), ''l'' = ''m'' + ''n'',
:&lt;math&gt;r_i=p_i+q_i&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;s_i=p_0 q_i + p_1 q_{i-1} + \cdots + p_i q_0.&lt;/math&gt;

If necessary, the polynomials ''p'' and ''q'' are extended by adding "dummy terms" with zero coefficients, so that the expressions for ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are always defined. Specifically, if {{nowrap|''m'' &lt; ''n''}}, then ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for {{nowrap|''m'' &lt; ''i'' ≤ ''n''}}.

The scalar multiplication is the special case of the multiplication where ''p'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced to its term which is independent of ''X'', that is
:&lt;math&gt;p_0(q_0 + q_1 X + \dots q_nX^n) = p_0q_0 +(p_0q_1)X + \cdots + (p_0q_n)X^n&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to verify that these three operations satisfy the axioms of a commutative algebra. Therefore, polynomial rings are also called ''polynomial algebras''.

Another equivalent definition is often preferred, although less intuitive, because it is easier to make it completely rigorous, which consists in defining a polynomial as an infinite [[sequence]] of elements of ''K'', {{nowrap|(''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... )}} having the property that only a finite number of the elements are nonzero, or equivalently, a sequence for which there is some ''m'' so that {{nowrap|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} for {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; ''m''}}. In this case, the expression 
:&lt;math&gt;p_0 + p_1 X + p_2 X^2 + \cdots + p_m X^m&lt;/math&gt;
is considered an alternate notation for the sequence {{nowrap|(''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, 0, 0, ...)}}.

More generally, the field ''K'' can be replaced by any [[commutative ring]] ''R'' when taking the same construction as above, giving rise to the '''polynomial ring over''' ''R'', which is denoted ''R''[''X''].

===Degree of a polynomial===
The '''degree''' of a polynomial ''p'', written deg(''p'') is the largest ''k'' such that the coefficient of ''X''{{i sup|''k''}} is not zero.&lt;ref&gt;Herstein p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the coefficient ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is called the '''leading coefficient'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lang p.100&lt;/ref&gt; In the special case of zero polynomial, all of whose coefficients are zero, the degree has been variously left undefined,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Calculus Single Variable|first1=Howard|last1=Anton|first2=Irl C.|last2=Bivens|first3=Stephen|last3=Davis|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=9780470647707|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2uv84cpJHQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; defined to be &amp;minus;1,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rational Algebraic Curves: A Computer Algebra Approach|volume=22|series=Algorithms and Computation in Mathematics|first1=J.

If ''K'' is a field, or more generally an [[integral domain]], then from the definition of multiplication,&lt;ref&gt;Herstein p.155, 162&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{deg}(pq) = \operatorname{deg}(p) + \operatorname{deg}(q).&lt;/math&gt; 
It follows immediately that if ''K'' is an integral domain then so is ''K''[''X''].&lt;ref&gt;Herstein p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Properties of ''K''[''X''] ===

==== Factorization in ''K''[''X''] ====
The next property of the polynomial ring is much deeper. Already [[Euclid]] noted that every positive integer can be uniquely  factored into a product of [[prime number|primes]] — this statement is now called the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]. The proof is based on [[Euclid's algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of [[natural number]]s. At each step of this algorithm, a pair {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}, {{nowrap|''a'' &gt; ''b''}}, of natural numbers is replaced by a new pair {{nowrap|(''b'', ''r'')}}, where ''r'' is the remainder from the division of ''a'' by ''b'', and the new numbers are ''smaller''. Gauss remarked that the procedure of division with the remainder can also be defined for polynomials: given two polynomials ''p'' and ''q'', where {{nowrap|''q'' ≠ 0}}, one can write

:&lt;math&gt; p = uq + r,&lt;/math&gt;

where the quotient ''u'' and the remainder ''r'' are polynomials, the degree of ''r'' is less than the degree of ''q'', and a decomposition with these properties is unique. The quotient and the remainder are found using the [[polynomial long division]]. The degree of the polynomial now plays a role similar to the absolute value of an integer: it is strictly less in the remainder ''r'' than it is in ''q'', and when repeating this step such decrease cannot go on indefinitely. Therefore, eventually some division will be exact, at which point the last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor of the initial two polynomials. Using the existence of greatest common divisors, Gauss was able to simultaneously rigorously prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic for integers and its generalization to polynomials. In fact there exist other commutative rings than '''Z''' and ''K''[''X''] that similarly admit an analogue of the Euclidean algorithm; all such rings are called [[Euclidean ring]]s. Rings for which there exists unique (in an appropriate sense) factorization of nonzero elements into [[Irreducible element|irreducible]] factors are called ''[[unique factorization domain]]s'' or ''factorial rings''; the given construction shows that all Euclidean rings, and in particular '''Z''' and ''K''[''X''], are unique factorization domains.

Although Euclidean algorithm allows proving the unique factorization property, it does not provide any algorithm for computing the factorization. For integers, there are [[Integer factorization|factorization algorithms]]. However, even with the fastest [[computer]]s, there are unable to factorize large integers with few large prime factors. This is the basis idea of the [[RSA cryptosystem]], that is widely used for secure [[internet]] communications. For polynomials over the integers, over the [[rational number]]s, or over a [[finite field]] there are efficient algorithms that are implemented in [[computer algebra system]]s (see [[Factorization of polynomials]]). On the other hand, there is an example of a field ''F'' such that there exist algorithms for the operations of ''F'', but there cannot exist any algorithm for deciding whether a polynomial of the form &lt;math&gt;X^p-a&lt;/math&gt; is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] or is a product of polynomials of lower degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Fröhlich, A.|author2=Shepherson, J. C.|title = On the factorisation of polynomials in a finite number of steps|journal = Mathematische Zeitschrift|volume = 62|issue=1|year = 1955|issn = 0025-5874|doi=10.1007/BF01180640|pages=331–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another corollary of the polynomial division with the remainder is the fact that every proper [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''I'' of ''K''[''X''] is [[principal ideal|principal]], i.e. ''I'' consists of the multiples of a single polynomial ''f''. Thus the polynomial ring ''K''[''X''] is a [[principal ideal domain]], and for the same reason every Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain. Also every principal ideal domain is a unique-factorization domain. These deductions make essential use of the fact that the polynomial coefficients lie in a [[field (mathematics)|field]], namely in the polynomial division step, which requires the leading coefficient of ''q'', which is only known to be non-zero, to have an inverse. If ''R'' is an integral domain that is not a field  then ''R''[''X''] is neither a Euclidean domain nor a principal ideal domain; however it could still be a unique factorization domain (and will be so if and only if ''R'' itself is a unique factorization domain, for instance if it is '''Z''' or another polynomial ring).

==== Quotient ring of ''K''[''X''] ====

The ring ''K''[''X''] of polynomials over ''K'' is obtained from ''K'' by adjoining one element, ''X''. It turns out that any commutative ring ''L'' containing ''K'' and generated as a ring by a single element in addition to ''K'' can be described using ''K''[''X'']. In particular, this applies to finite [[field extension]]s of ''K''.

Let us consider an element {{math|''θ''}} in a commutative ring ''L'' that contains ''K''. There is a unique [[ring homomorphism]] {{math|''φ''}} from ''K''[''X''] into ''L'' that maps ''X'' to {{math|''θ''}} and does not affect the elements of ''K'' itself (it is the [[identity function|identity map]] on ''K''). This homomorphism is unique since it must maps each power of ''X'' to the same power of {{math|''θ''}} and any linear combination of powers of ''X'' with coefficients in ''K'' to the same linear combination of powers of ''X''. It consists thus of "replacing ''X'' with {{math|''θ''}}" in every polynomial. 

: &lt;math&gt; \varphi(a_m X^m + a_{m - 1} X^{m - 1} + \cdots + a_1 X + a_0) = 
a_m \theta^m + a_{m - 1} \theta^{m - 1} + \cdots + a_1 \theta + a_0.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''L'' is generated as a ring by adding {{math|''θ''}} to ''K'', any element of ''L'' appears as the right hand side of the last expression for suitable ''m'' and elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''K''. Therefore, {{math|''φ''}} is [[surjective]] and ''L'' is a homomorphic image of ''K''[''X'']. More formally, let {{math|Ker ''φ''}} be the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of {{math|''φ''}}. It is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of ''K''[''X''] and by the first [[isomorphism theorem]] for rings, ''L'' is [[isomorphic]] to the quotient of the polynomial ring ''K''[''X''] by the ideal {{math|Ker ''φ''}}. Since the polynomial ring is a principal ideal domain, this ideal is [[principal ideal|principal]]: there exists a polynomial {{nowrap|''p'' ∈ ''K''[''X'']}} such that

:&lt;math&gt; L \simeq K[X]/(p), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(p)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ideal generated by &lt;math&gt;p.&lt;/math&gt;

A particularly important application is to the case when the larger ring ''L'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Then the polynomial ''p'' must be [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]]. Conversely, the [[primitive element theorem]] states that any finite separable field extension ''L''/''K'' can be generated by a single element {{nowrap|''θ'' ∈ ''L''}} and the preceding theory then gives a concrete description of the field ''L'' as the quotient of the polynomial ring ''K''[''X''] by a principal ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial ''p''. As an illustration, the field '''C''' of [[complex number]]s is an extension of the field '''R''' of [[real number]]s generated by a single element ''i'' such that ''i''{{i sup|2}} + 1 = 0. Accordingly, the polynomial ''X''{{i sup|2}} + 1 is irreducible over '''R''' and

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C} \simeq \mathbb{R}[X]/(X^2+1). &lt;/math&gt;

More generally, given a (not necessarily commutative) ring ''A'' containing ''K'' and an element ''a'' of ''A'' that commutes with all elements of ''K'', there is a unique ring homomorphism from the polynomial ring ''K''[X] to ''A'' that maps ''X'' to ''a'':

:&lt;math&gt; \phi: K[X]\to A, \quad \phi(X)=a.&lt;/math&gt;

This homomorphism is given by the same formula as before, but it is not surjective in general. The existence and uniqueness of such a homomorphism {{math|''φ''}} expresses a certain [[universal property]] of the ring of polynomials in one variable and explains the ubiquity of polynomial rings in various questions and constructions of [[ring theory]] and [[commutative algebra]].

=== Modules ===

The [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]] applies to
''K''[''X'']. This means that every finitely generated module over ''K''[''X''] may be decomposed into a [[direct sum]] of a [[free module]] and finitely many modules of the form &lt;math&gt;K[X]/\langle P^k \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''P'' is an [[irreducible polynomial]] over ''K'' and ''k'' a positive integer.

== Polynomial evaluation ==

Let ''K'' be a field or, more generally, a [[commutative ring]], and ''R'' a ring containing ''K''. For any polynomial ''P'' in ''K''[X] and any element ''a'' in ''R'', the substitution of ''X'' by ''a'' in ''P'' defines an element of ''R'', which is denoted [[Polynomial notation|''P''(''a'')]]. This element is obtained by, after the substitution, carrying on, in ''R'', the operations indicated by the expression of the polynomial. This computation is called the ''evaluation'' of ''P'' at ''a''. For example, if we have 
:&lt;math&gt;P=X^2-1,&lt;/math&gt;
we have 
:&lt;math&gt;P(3) = 3^2-1 = 8, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(X^2+1) = (X^2+1)^2-1 = X^4+2X^2&lt;/math&gt;
(in the first example ''R'' = ''K'', and in the second one ''R'' = ''K''[''X'']). Substituting ''X'' by itself results in 
:&lt;math&gt;P=P(X),&lt;/math&gt;
explaining why the sentences "''Let P be a polynomial''" and "''Let P''(''X'') ''be a polynomial''" are equivalent.

For every ''a'' in ''R'', the map &lt;math&gt;P \mapsto P(a)&lt;/math&gt; defines a [[ring homomorphism]] from ''K''[''X''] into ''R''.

The ''polynomial function'' defined by a polynomial ''P'' is the function from ''K'' into ''K'' that is defined by &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto P(x).&lt;/math&gt; If ''K'' is an infinite field, two different polynomials define different polynomial functions, but this property is false for finite fields. For example, if ''K'' is a field with ''q'' elements, then the polynomials 0 and ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;-''X'' both define the zero function.

==The polynomial ring in several variables==
{{Anchor|multivariable}}

=== Polynomials ===
A polynomial in ''n'' variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with coefficients in a field ''K'' is defined analogously to a polynomial in one variable, but the notation is more cumbersome. For any [[multi-index]] ''α'' = (''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), where each ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a non-negative integer, let

:&lt;math&gt; X^\alpha = \prod_{i=1}^n X_i^{\alpha_i} =
X_1^{\alpha_1}\ldots X_n^{\alpha_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The product ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt; is called the '''[[monomial]]''' of multidegree ''α''. A '''polynomial''' is a finite linear combination of monomials with coefficients in ''K''

:&lt;math&gt; p = \sum_\alpha p_\alpha X^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt;p_\alpha = p_{\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n}\in{K},&lt;/math&gt;
and only finitely many coefficients ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; are different from 0. The '''degree''' of a monomial ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;, frequently denoted |''α''|, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; |\alpha| = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i,\ &lt;/math&gt;

and the degree of a polynomial ''p'' is the largest degree of a monomial occurring with non-zero coefficient in the expansion of ''p''.

=== The polynomial ring ===
{{anchor|free commutative algebra|free commutative ring}}
Polynomials in ''n'' variables with coefficients in ''K'' form a commutative ring denoted 
''K''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;], or sometimes ''K''[''X''], where ''X'' is a symbol representing the full set of variables, ''X'' = (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), and called the '''polynomial ring in ''n'' variables'''. The polynomial ring in ''n'' variables can be obtained by repeated application of ''K''[''X''] (the order by which is irrelevant). For example, ''K''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] is [[Ring isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''K''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;][''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. 

Polynomials in several variables play fundamental role in [[algebraic geometry]]. Many results in [[commutative algebra|commutative]] and [[homological algebra]] originated in the study of ideals and modules over polynomial rings.

Polynomial rings may also be referred to as '''free commutative algebras''', since they are the [[free object]]s in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[commutative algebra (structure)|commutative algebras]]. Similarly, a polynomial ring with coefficients in the integers is the '''free commutative ring''' over its set of variables.

=== Hilbert's Nullstellensatz ===
{{Main article|Hilbert's Nullstellensatz}}

A group of fundamental results concerning the relation between ideals of the polynomial ring ''K''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] and [[algebraic set|algebraic subsets]] of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; originating with [[David Hilbert]] is known under the name '''Nullstellensatz''' (literally: "zero-locus theorem").

* (''Weak form, algebraically closed field of coefficients''). Let ''K'' be an [[algebraically closed field]]. Then every [[maximal ideal]] ''m'' of ''K''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] has the form

:: &lt;math&gt; m = (X_1-a_1, \ldots, X_n-a_n), 
\quad a = (a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in {K}^n. &lt;/math&gt;

* (''Weak form, any field of coefficients''). Let ''k'' be a field, ''K'' be an [[algebraically closed]] [[field extension]] of ''k'', and ''I'' be an ideal in the polynomial ring ''k''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]. Then ''I'' contains 1 if and only if the polynomials in ''I'' do not have any common zero in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* (''Strong form''). Let ''k'' be a field, ''K'' be an [[algebraically closed]] [[field extension]] of ''k'', ''I'' be an ideal in the polynomial ring ''k''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;],and ''V''(''I'') be the algebraic subset of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; defined by ''I''. Suppose that ''f'' is a polynomial which vanishes at all points of ''V''(''I''). Then some power of ''f'' belongs to the ideal ''I'':

:: &lt;math&gt; f^m \in I, \text{ for some } m\in \mathbb{N}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

: Using the notion of the [[radical of an ideal]], the conclusion says that ''f'' belongs to the radical of ''I''. As a corollary of this form of Nullstellensatz, there is a [[bijective]] correspondence between the radical ideals of ''K''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] for an algebraically closed field ''K'' and the algebraic subsets of the ''n''-dimensional [[affine space]] ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. It arises from the map

:: &lt;math&gt; I \mapsto V(I), \quad I\subset K[X_1,\ldots,X_n], \quad V(I)\subset K^n. &lt;/math&gt;

: The [[prime ideal]]s of the polynomial ring correspond to [[irreducible component|irreducible]] subvarieties of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Properties of the ring extension ''R'' &amp;sub; ''R''[''X''] ==
&lt;!-- This is still in preliminary form --&gt;

One of the basic techniques in [[commutative algebra]] is to relate properties of a ring with properties of its [[subring]]s. The notation ''R'' ⊂ ''S'' indicates that a ring ''R'' is a subring  of a ring ''S''. In this case ''S'' is called an ''overring'' of ''R'' and one speaks of a '''ring extension'''. This works particularly well for polynomial rings and allows one to establish many important properties of the ring of polynomials in several variables over a field, ''K''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;], by induction in ''n''.

=== Summary of the results ===

In the following properties, ''R'' is a commutative ring and ''S'' = ''R''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] is the ring of polynomials in ''n'' variables over ''R''. The ring extension ''R'' ⊂ ''S'' can be built from ''R'' in ''n'' steps, by successively adjoining  ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus to establish each of the properties below, it is sufficient to consider the case ''n'' = 1.

* If ''R'' is an [[integral domain]] then the same holds for ''S''.
* If ''R'' is a [[unique factorization domain]] then the same holds for ''S''. The proof is based on the [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss lemma]].
* '''[[Hilbert's basis theorem]]''': If ''R'' is a [[Noetherian ring]], then the same holds for ''S''.
* Suppose that ''R'' is a Noetherian ring of finite [[global dimension]]. Then

:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{gl}\,\dim R[X_1,\ldots,X_n] = \operatorname{gl}\, \dim R + n.&lt;/math&gt;

: An analogous result holds for [[Krull dimension]].

==Generalizations==

Polynomial rings can be generalized in a great many ways, including polynomial rings with generalized exponents, power series rings, [[noncommutative polynomial ring]]s, and skew-polynomial rings.

=== Infinitely many variables ===
{{Expand section|date = July 2017}}
One slight generalization of polynomial rings is to allow for infinitely many indeterminates.  Each monomial still involves only a finite number of indeterminates (so that its degree remains finite), and each polynomial is a still a (finite) linear combination of monomials.  Thus, any individual polynomial involves only finitely many indeterminates, and any finite computation involving polynomials remains inside some subring of polynomials in finitely many indeterminates.

In the case of infinitely many indeterminates, one can consider a ring strictly larger than the polynomial ring but smaller than the power series ring, by taking the subring of the latter formed by power series whose monomials have a bounded degree. Its elements still have a finite degree and are therefore somewhat like polynomials, but it is possible for instance to take the sum of all indeterminates, which is not a polynomial. A ring of this kind plays a role in constructing the [[ring of symmetric functions]].

===Generalized exponents===
{{Main article|Monoid ring}}
A simple generalization only changes the set from which the exponents on the variable are drawn.  The formulas for addition and multiplication make sense as long as one can add exponents: ''X''{{i sup|''i''}} · ''X''{{i sup|''j''}} = ''X''{{i sup|''i''+''j''}}.  A set for which addition makes sense (is closed and associative) is called a [[monoid]].  The set of functions from a monoid ''N'' to a ring ''R'' which are nonzero at only finitely many places can be given the structure of a ring known as ''R''[''N''], the '''monoid ring''' of ''N'' with coefficients in ''R''.  The addition is defined component-wise, so that if {{nowrap|1=''c'' = ''a'' + ''b''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for every ''n'' in ''N''.  The multiplication is defined as the Cauchy product, so that if {{nowrap|1=''c'' = ''a'' · ''b''}}, then for each ''n'' in ''N'', ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of all ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''i'', ''j'' range over all pairs of elements of ''N'' which sum to ''n''.

When ''N'' is commutative, it is convenient to denote the function ''a'' in ''R''[''N''] as the formal sum:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \in N} a_n X^n&lt;/math&gt;
and then the formulas for addition and multiplication are the familiar:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{n \in N} a_n X^n\right) + \left(\sum_{n \in N} b_n X^n\right) = \sum_{n \in N} (a_n+b_n)X^n&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{n \in N} a_n X^n\right) \cdot \left(\sum_{n \in N} b_n X^n\right) = \sum_{n \in N} \left( \sum_{i+j=n} a_ib_j\right)X^n&lt;/math&gt;
where the latter sum is taken over all ''i'', ''j'' in ''N'' that sum to ''n''.

Some authors such as {{harv|Lang|2002|loc=II,&amp;sect;3}} go so far as to take this monoid definition as the starting point, and regular single variable polynomials are the special case where ''N'' is the monoid of non-negative integers.  Polynomials in several variables simply take ''N'' to be the direct product of several copies of the monoid of non-negative integers.  &lt;!-- Quite tempting to say, ''N'' = '''N'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. --&gt;

Several interesting examples of rings and groups are formed by taking ''N'' to be the additive monoid of non-negative rational numbers, {{harv|Osbourne|2000|loc=&amp;sect;4.4}}. See also [[Puiseux series]].

===Power series===
{{Main article|Formal power series}}

Power series generalize the choice of exponent in a different direction by allowing infinitely many nonzero terms.  This requires various hypotheses on the monoid ''N'' used for the exponents, to ensure that the sums in the Cauchy product are finite sums.  Alternatively, a topology can be placed on the ring, and then one restricts to convergent infinite sums.  For the standard choice of ''N'', the non-negative integers, there is no trouble, and the ring of formal power series is defined as the set of functions from ''N'' to a ring ''R'' with addition component-wise, and multiplication given by the Cauchy product.  The ring of power series can be seen as the completion of the polynomial ring.

===Noncommutative polynomial rings===
{{Main article|Free algebra}}

For polynomial rings of more than one variable, the products ''X''·''Y'' and ''Y''·''X'' are simply defined to be equal.  A more general notion of polynomial ring is obtained when the distinction between these two formal products is maintained.  Formally, the polynomial ring in ''n'' noncommuting variables with coefficients in the ring ''R'' is the [[monoid ring]] ''R''[''N''], where the monoid ''N'' is the [[free monoid]] on ''n'' letters, also known as the set of all strings over an alphabet of ''n'' symbols, with multiplication given by concatenation.  Neither the coefficients nor the variables need commute amongst themselves, but the coefficients and variables commute with each other.

Just as the polynomial ring in ''n'' variables with coefficients in the commutative ring ''R'' is the free commutative ''R''-algebra of rank ''n'', the noncommutative polynomial ring in ''n'' variables with coefficients in the commutative ring ''R'' is the free associative, unital ''R''-algebra on ''n'' generators, which is noncommutative when ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

===Differential and skew-polynomial rings===
{{Main article|Ore extension}}

Other generalizations of polynomials are differential and skew-polynomial rings.

A '''differential polynomial ring''' is a ring of [[differential operator]]s formed from a ring ''R'' and a [[Derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] ''δ'' of ''R'' into ''R''. This derivation operates on ''R'', and will be denoted ''X'', when viewed as an operator. The elements of ''R'' also operate on ''R'' by multiplication. The [[function composition|composition of operators]] is denoted as the usual multiplication. It follows that the relation ''δ''(''ab'') = ''aδ''(''b'') + ''δ''(''a'')''b'' may be rewritten
as
: &lt;math&gt;X\cdot a = a\cdot X +\delta(a).&lt;/math&gt;

This relation may be extended to define a skew multiplication between two polynomials in ''X'' with coefficients in ''R'', which make them a non-commutative ring.

The standard example, called a [[Weyl algebra]], takes ''R'' to be a (usual) polynomial ring ''k''[''Y''], and ''δ'' to be the standard polynomial derivative &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial}{\partial Y}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking ''a'' =''Y'' in the above relation, one gets the [[canonical commutation relation]], ''X''·''Y'' &amp;minus; ''Y''·''X'' = 1. Extending this relation by associativity and distributivity allows explicitly constructing the [[Weyl algebra]].{{harv|Lam|2001|loc=§1,ex1.9}}.

The '''skew-polynomial ring''' is defined similarly for a ring ''R'' and a ring endomorphism ''f'' of ''R'', by extending the  multiplication from the relation ''X''·''r'' = ''f''(''r'')·''X'' to produce an associative multiplication that distributes over the standard addition. More generally, given a homomorphism ''F'' from the monoid '''N''' of the positive integers into the endomorphism ring of ''R'', the formula ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;·''r'' = ''F''(''n'')(''r'')·''X''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; allows constructing a skew-polynomial ring.{{harv|Lam|2001|loc=§1,ex 1.11}}  Skew polynomial rings are closely related to [[crossed product]] algebras.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2591">In [[mathematics]], '''projective differential geometry''' is the study of [[differential geometry]], from the point of view of properties of mathematical objects such as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, [[diffeomorphism]]s, and [[submanifold]]s, that are invariant under transformations of the [[projective group]]. This is a mixture of the approaches from [[Riemannian geometry]] of studying invariances, and of the [[Erlangen program]] of characterizing geometries according to their group symmetries. 

The area was much studied by mathematicians from around 1890 for a generation (by [[J. G. Darboux]], [[George Henri Halphen]], [[Ernest Julius Wilczynski]], [[E. Bompiani]], [[G. Fubini]], [[Eduard &amp;#268;ech]], amongst others), without a comprehensive theory of [[differential invariant]]s emerging. [[Élie Cartan]] formulated the idea of a general [[projective connection]], as part of his [[method of moving frames]]; abstractly speaking, this is the level of generality at which the Erlangen program can be reconciled with differential geometry, while it also develops the oldest part of the theory (for the [[projective line]]), namely the [[Schwarzian derivative]], the simplest projective differential invariant.&lt;ref name=Ovsienko2004&gt;{{cite book|last=V. Ovsienko and S. Tabachnikov|title=Projective Differential Geometry Old and New From the Schwarzian Derivative to the Cohomology of Diffeomorphism Groups|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521831864|page=vii (preface)|url=http://www.math.psu.edu/tabachni/Books/BookPro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further work from the 1930s onwards was carried out by [[J. Kanitani]], [[Shiing-Shen Chern]], [[A. P. Norden]], [[G. Bol]], [[S. P. Finikov]] and [[G. F. Laptev]]. Even the basic results on [[osculation]] of [[curve]]s, a manifestly projective-invariant topic, lack any comprehensive theory. The ideas of projective differential geometry recur in mathematics and its applications, but the formulations given are still rooted in the language of the early twentieth century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5007">
A '''random permutation''' is a [[random]] ordering of a set of objects, that is, a [[permutation]]-valued [[random variable]].  The use of random permutations is often fundamental to fields that use [[randomized algorithm]]s such as [[coding theory]], [[cryptography]], and [[simulation]].  A good example of a random permutation is the [[shuffling]] of a [[Playing card|deck of cards]]:  this is ideally a random permutation of the 52 cards.

==Generating random permutations==
===Entry-by-entry brute force method===
One method of generating a random permutation of a set of length ''n'' [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly at random]] (i.e., each of the ''n''! [[permutation]]s is equally likely to appear) is to generate a [[sequence]] by taking a random number between 1 and ''n'' sequentially, ensuring that there is no repetition, and interpreting this sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) as the permutation

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \cdots &amp; n \\
x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; x_3 &amp; \cdots &amp; x_n \\
\end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

shown here in [[permutation#Notation|two-line notation]].

This brute-force method will require occasional retries whenever the random number picked is a repeat of a number already selected.  This can be avoided if, on the ''i''th step (when ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt; have already been chosen), one chooses a number ''j'' at random between 1 and ''n'' &amp;minus; ''i'' + 1 and sets ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; equal to the ''j''th largest of the unchosen numbers.

===Knuth shuffles===
A simple [[algorithm]] to generate a permutation of ''n'' items uniformly at random without retries, known as the [[Knuth shuffle]], is to start with any permutation (for example, the [[Identity function|identity permutation]]), and then go through the positions 0 through ''n'' − 2 (we use a convention where the first element has index 0, and the last element has index ''n'' − 1), and for each position ''i'' '''swap''' the element currently there with a randomly chosen element from positions ''i'' through ''n'' − 1 (the end), inclusive. It's easy to verify that any permutation of ''n'' elements will be produced by this algorithm with probability exactly 1/''n''!, thus yielding a uniform distribution over all such permutations.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
unsigned uniform(unsigned m); /* Returns a random integer 0 &lt;= uniform(m) &lt;= m-1 with uniform distribution */

void initialize_and_permute(unsigned permutation[], unsigned n)
{
    unsigned i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt;= n-2; i++) {
        unsigned j = i+uniform(n-i); /* A random integer such that i ≤ j &lt; n*/
        swap(permutation[i], permutation[j]);   /* Swap the randomly picked element with permutation[i] */
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the &lt;code&gt;uniform()&lt;/code&gt; function can ''not'' be implemented simply as &lt;code&gt;random() % (m)&lt;/code&gt; unless a bias in the results is acceptable.

==Statistics on random permutations==
===Fixed points===
{{main|Rencontres numbers}}
The [[probability distribution]] of the number of [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of a uniformly distributed random permutation approaches a [[Poisson distribution]] with [[expected value]] 1 as ''n'' grows. In particular, it is an elegant application of the [[inclusion–exclusion principle]] to show that the probability that there are no fixed points approaches 1/''e''. The first ''n'' [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of this distribution are exactly those of the Poisson distribution.

== Randomness testing ==
As with all random processes, the quality of the resulting distribution of an implementation of a randomized algorithm such as the Knuth shuffle (i.e., how close it is to the desired uniform distribution) depends on the quality of the underlying source of randomness, such as a [[pseudorandom number generator]]. There are many possible [[randomness test]]s for random permutations, such as some of the [[Diehard tests]]. A typical example of such a test is to take some [[permutation statistic]] for which the distribution is known and test whether the distribution of this statistic on a set of randomly generated permutations closely approximates the true distribution.

'''[[File:Portrait of Richard Watson, D.D. Lord Bishop of Landaff (4672127).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Richard Watson]]'''
'''Richard Watson''' (1737–1816) was an [[Anglican]] bishop and academic, who served as the [[Bishop of Llandaff]] from 1782 to 1816. He wrote some notable [[pamphlet|political pamphlets]]. In theology, he belonged to an influential group of followers of [[Edmund Law]] that included also [[John Hey]] and [[William Paley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans J. Hillerbrand|title=Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMSTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA558|date=2 August 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-96028-5|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Watson was born in [[Heversham]], [[Westmorland]] (now [[Cumbria]]), and educated at [[Heversham Grammar School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id=WT754R|name=Watson, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a scholarship endowed by Edward Wilson of Nether Levens (1557–1653).&lt;ref&gt;R Percival Brown, ''Edward Wilson of Nether Levens (1557–1653) and his kin'' (Kendal, 1930)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1759 he graduated as [[Second Wrangler]] after having challenged Massey for the position of [[Senior Wrangler]]. This challenge, in part, prompted the University Proctor, [[William Farish (chemist)|William Farish]], to introduce the practice of assigning specific marks to individual questions in University tests and, in so doing, replaced the practice of 'judgement' at Cambridge with 'marking'. Marking subsequently emerged as the predominant method to determine rank order in meritocratic systems.&lt;ref&gt;Pollitt, A. (2012). Comparative judgement for assessment. International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 22(2), 157–170.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1760 he became a [[fellow]] of Trinity&lt;ref name="Venn"/&gt; and in 1762 received his [[Oxford MA|MA]] degree.  He became a professor of [[chemistry]] in 1764 and was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1769 after publishing a paper on the solution of salts in ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]]''.

Watson's theological career began when he became the Cambridge [[Regius Professor of Divinity]] in 1771.&lt;ref name=Venn /&gt; In 1773, he married Dorothy Wilson, daughter of Edward Wilson of [[Dallam Tower]] and a descendant of the eponymous benefactor who had endowed Watson's scholarship. In 1774, he took up the position of [[prebendary]] of [[Ely Cathedral]].  He became [[archdeacon of Ely]] and [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Northwold]] in 1779, leaving the Northwold post two years later to become rector of [[Knaptoft]].  In 1782, he left all his previous appointments to take up the post of Bishop of Llandaff, which he held until his death in 1816. In 1788, he purchased the [[Calgarth]] estate in [[Troutbeck Bridge]], [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]], Westmorland. The same year he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter W|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterW.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson was buried at [[St Martin's Church, Bowness-on-Windermere|St Martin's Church]] in [[Bowness-on-Windermere]].

==Works==
Watson contributed to the [[Revolution Controversy|Revolution controversy]], with ''A treatise upon the authenticity of the Scriptures, and the truth of the Christian religion'' (1792) and most notably in 1796 when he delivered his counterblast to [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' in ''An Apology for the Bible'' which he had "reason to believe, was of singular service in stopping that torrent of irreligion which had been excited by [Paine's] writings".&lt;ref&gt;''Anecdotes of the life of Richard Watson, Bishop of Landaff'' (1817) p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798 he published ''An Address to the People of Great Britain'', which argued for national taxes to be raised to pay for the war against France and to reduce the [[national debt]]. [[Gilbert Wakefield]], a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister who taught at [[Warrington Academy]], responded with ''A Reply to Some Parts of the Bishop Llandaff's Address to the People of Great Britain'', attacking the privileged position of the wealthy.

An autobiography, ''Anecdotes of the life of Richard Watson, Bishop of Landaff'', was finished in 1814 and published posthumously in 1817.

In the 19th century, it was rumoured that Watson had been the first to propose the [[electric telegraph]], but this is incorrect. At the time [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] (1715–1787) made researches in electricity, but even he was not involved in the telegraph.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kj5JAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=electric%201747%20william%20watson%20shooter's%20hill&amp;hl=sv&amp;pg=PA790#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bishop Watson and the Electric Telegraph], by Dr. Hamel, of St. Petersburg, in ''The Journal of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce'', vol. 9 (25 October 1861), pp. 790–791.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-propelled particles''' (SPP), also referred to as '''self-driven particles,''' are terms used by physicists to describe [[autonomous agent]]s, which convert energy from the environment into directed or persistent motion. Natural systems which have inspired the study and design of these particles include walking, swimming or flying animals. Other biological systems include bacteria, cells, algae and other micro-organisms. Generally, self-propelled particles often refer to artificial systems such as robots or specifically designed particles such as swimming [[Janus particles|Janus colloids]], [[nanomotors]] and walking grains. In the case of directed propulsion, which is driven by a chemical gradient, this is referred to as [[chemotaxis|chemotaxis,]] observed in biological systems, e.g. bacteria quorum sensing and ant pheromone detection, and in synthetic systems, e.g. bimetallic nanorods and enzyme molecule chemotaxis. 

==Overview==
Self-propelled particles interact with each other, which can lead to the emergence of collective behaviours. These collective behaviours mimic the self-organization observed with the flocking of birds, the swarming of bugs, the formation of sheep herds, etc.

To understand the ubiquity of such phenomena, physicists have developed a number of self-propelled particles models. These models predict that self-propelled particles share certain properties at the group level, regardless of the type of animals (or artificial particles) in the swarm.&lt;ref name="Buhl et al" /&gt;  It has become a challenge in theoretical physics to find minimal statistical models that capture these behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toner | first1 = J. | last2 = Tu | first2 = Y. | last3 = Ramaswamy | first3 = S. | year = 2005 | url = http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/3397/1/A89.pdf | title = Hydrodynamics and phases of flocks | journal = [[Annals of Physics]] | volume = 318 | issue = 170 | doi = 10.1016/j.aop.2005.04.011 | pages = 170–244 | bibcode=2005AnPhy.318..170T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bertin et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bertin | first1 = E. | last2 = Droz | first2 = M. | last3 = Grégoire | first3 = G. | year = 2009 | arxiv = 0907.4688 | title = Hydrodynamic equations for self-propelled particles: microscopic derivation and stability analysis | journal = [[Journal of Physics A]] | volume = 42 | issue = 44 | page = 445001 | doi = 10.1088/1751-8113/42/44/445001 |bibcode = 2009JPhA...42R5001B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Li et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Li|first1 = Y.

== Examples ==

=== Biological systems ===
Most animals can be seen as SPP: they find energy in their food and exhibit various locomotion strategies, from flying to crawling. The most prominent examples of collective behaviours in these systems are fish schools, birds flocks, sheep herds, human crowds. At a smaller scale, cells and bacteria can also be treated as SPP. These biological systems can propel themselves based on the presence of chemoattractants.  At even smaller scale, [[Molecular motor|molecular motors]] transform ATP energy into directional motion. Recent work has shown that enzyme molecules will also propel themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Substrate Catalysis Enhances Single Enzyme Diffusion|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|date = 2010-02-24|issn = 0002-7863|pmc = 2832858|pmid = 20108965|pages = 2110–2111|volume = 132|issue = 7|doi = 10.1021/ja908773a|first = Hari S.|last = Muddana|first2 = Samudra|last2 = Sengupta|first3 = Thomas E.|last3 = Mallouk|first4 = Ayusman|last4 = Sen|first5 = Peter J.|last5 = Butler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it has been shown that they will preferentially move towards a region of higher substrate concentration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Enzyme Molecules as Nanomotors|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja3091615|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|date = 2013-01-30|issn = 0002-7863|pages = 1406–1414|volume = 135|issue = 4|doi = 10.1021/ja3091615|first = Samudra|last = Sengupta|first2 = Krishna K.|last2 = Dey|first3 = Hari S.|last3 = Muddana|first4 = Tristan|last4 = Tabouillot|first5 = Michael E.|last5 = Ibele|first6 = Peter J.|last6 = Butler|first7 = Ayusman|last7 = Sen}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phenomenon that has been developed into a purification technique to isolate live enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chemotactic Separation of Enzymes|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn504418u|journal = ACS Nano|date = 2014-12-23|issn = 1936-0851|pages = 11941–11949|volume = 8|issue = 12|doi = 10.1021/nn504418u|first = Krishna Kanti|last = Dey|first2 = Sambeeta|last2 = Das|first3 = Matthew F.|last3 = Poyton|first4 = Samudra|last4 = Sengupta|first5 = Peter J.|last5 = Butler|first6 = Paul S.|last6 = Cremer|first7 = Ayusman|last7 = Sen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, microparticles can become self-propelled when they are functionalized with enzymes.

[[File:AuPtnanomotor.jpg|thumb|An example of a SPP: a gold-platinum nanorod which undergoes self-propulsion in hydrogen peroxide due to self-electrophoretic forces.|400x400px]]

There is a distinction between wet and dry systems. In the first case the particles "swim" in a surrounding fluid; in the second case the particles  "walk" on a substrate. 

Active colloidal particles, dubbed [[Nanomotor|nanomotors]], are the prototypical example of wet SPP. [[Janus particles]] are colloidal particles with two different sides, having different physical or chemical properties. This [[symmetry breaking]] allows, by properly tuning the environment (typically the surrounding solution), for the motion of the Janus particle. For instance, the two sides of the Janus particle can induce a local gradient of, temperature, electric field, or concentration of chemical species. This induces motion of the Janus particle along the gradient through, respectively, [[thermophoresis]], [[electrophoresis]] or [[diffusiophoresis]]. Because the Janus particles consume energy from their environment (catalysis of chemical reactions, light absorption, etc.), the resulting motion constitutes an irreversible process and the particles are out of equilibrium.  
* The first example of an artificial SPP on the nano or micron scale was a gold-platinum bimetallic nanorod developed by [[Ayusman Sen|Sen]] and Mallouk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Catalytic Nanomotors:  Autonomous Movement of Striped Nanorods|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja047697z|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|date = 2004-10-01|issn = 0002-7863|pages = 13424–13431|volume = 126|issue = 41|doi = 10.1021/ja047697z|first = Walter F.|last = Paxton|first2 = Kevin C.|last2 = Kistler|first3 = Christine C.|last3 = Olmeda|first4 = Ayusman|last4 = Sen|first5 = Sarah K.|last5 = St. Angelo|first6 = Yanyan|last6 = Cao|first7 = Thomas E.|last7 = Mallouk|first8 = Paul E.|last8 = Lammert|first9 = Vincent H.|last9 = Crespi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a solution of hydrogen peroxide, this "nanomotor" would exhibit a catalytic oxidation-reduction reaction, thereby inducing a fluid flow along the surface through self-diffusiophoresis.

* Another Janus SPP was developed by coating half of a polystyrene bead with platinum. These were used to direct the motion of catalytic motors when they were close to a solid surface. These systems were able to move the active colloids using geometric constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Das|first=Sambeeta|last2=Garg|first2=Astha|last3=Campbell|first3=Andrew I.|last4=Howse|first4=Jonathan|last5=Sen|first5=Ayusman|last6=Velegol|first6=Darrell|last7=Golestanian|first7=Ramin|last8=Ebbens|first8=Stephen J.|date=2015-12-02|title=Boundaries can steer active Janus spheres|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms9999|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/ncomms9999|issn=2041-1723|pmc=4686856|pmid=26627125|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E8999D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walking grains are a typical realization of dry SPP: The grains are milli-metric disks sitting on a vertically vibrating plate, which serves as the source of energy and momentum. The disks have two different contacts ("feet") with the plate, a hard needle-like foot in the front and a large soft rubber foot in the back. When shaken, the disks move in a preferential direction defined by the polar (head-tail) symmetry of the contacts.  This together with the vibrational noise result in a persistent random walk.&lt;ref&gt;Deseigne J., Dauchot O. and Chaté H. (2010) [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.098001 "Collective motion of vibrated polar disks"]. ''Physical review letters'', '''105''' (9):098001. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.098001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typical collective behaviour ==
Typical [[collective motion]] generally includes the formation of self-assembled structures, such as clusters and organized assemblies. 

The prominent and most spectacular emergent large scale behaviour observed in assemblies of SPP is directed [[collective motion]]. In that case all particles move in the same direction. On top of that, spatial structures can emerge such as bands, vortices, asters, moving clusters.

Another class of large scale behaviour, which does ''not'' imply directed motion is either the spontaneous formation of clusters or the separation in a gas-like and a liquid-like phase, an unexpected phenomenon when the SPP have purely repulsive interaction. This phase separation has been called Motility Induced Phase Separation (MIPS).

== Examples of modelling ==

The modeling of SPP was introduced in 1995 by [[Tamás Vicsek]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Vicsek1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vicsek | first1 = T. | last2 = Czirok | first2 = A. | last3 = Ben-Jacob | first3 = E. | last4 = Cohen | first4 = I. | last5 = Shochet | first5 = O. | year = 1995 | arxiv = cond-mat/0611743 | title = Novel type of phase transition in a system of self-driven particles | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 75 | pages = 1226–1229 | url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0611743 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1226 | issue = 6 | bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1226V | pmid=10060237}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a special case of the [[Boids]] model introduced in 1986 by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reynolds | first = C.W. | year = 1987 | title = Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model | journal = Computer Graphics | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 25–34 | doi = 10.1145/37401.37406 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.103.7187 | isbn = 0897912276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case the SPP are point particles, which move with a constant speed. and adopt (at each time increment) the average direction of motion of the other particles in their local neighborhood up to some added noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Czirók | first1 = A. | last2 = Vicsek | first2 = T. | year = 2006 | arxiv = cond-mat/0611742 | title = Collective behavior of interacting self-propelled particles | journal = [[Physica A]] | volume = 281 | pages = 17–29 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-4371(00)00013-3 | bibcode=2000PhyA..281...17C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jadbabaie2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jadbabaie | first1 = A. | last2 = Lin | first2 = J. | last3 = Morse | first3 = A.S. | year = 2003 | title = Coordination of groups of mobile autonomous agents using nearest neighbor rules | journal = IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 988–1001 | doi = 10.1109/TAC.2003.812781 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.128.5326 | postscript = &amp;nbsp;– }} convergence proofs for the SPP model.&lt;/ref&gt;{{External media

Simulations demonstrate that a suitable "nearest neighbour rule" eventually results in all the particles swarming together, or moving in the same direction. This emerges, even though there is no centralised coordination, and even though the neighbours for each particle constantly change over time (see the interactive simulation in the box on the right).&lt;ref name="Vicsek1995"/&gt;

Since then a number of models have been proposed, ranging from the simples so called Active Brownian Particle to highly elaborated and specialized models aiming at describing specific systems and situations. Among the important ingredients in these models, one can list 
* Self-propulsion: in the absence of interaction, the SPP speed converges to a prescribed constant value
* Body interactions: the particles can be considered as points (no body interaction) like in the Vicsek model. Alternatively one can include an interaction potential, either attractive or repulsive.  This potential can be isotropic or not to describe spherical or elongated particles.
* Body orientation:  for those particles with a body-fixed axis, one can include additional degrees of freedom to describe the orientation of the body. The coupling of this body axis with the velocity is an additional option.
* Aligning interaction rules: in the spirit of the Vicsek model, neighboring particles align their velocities. An other possibility is that they align their orientations.
One can also include effective influences of the surrounding; for instance the nominal velocity of the SPP can be set to depend on the local density, in order to take into account crowding effects.

===Marching locusts===
Young [[desert locust]]s are solitary and wingless [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]]. If food is short they can gather together and start occupying neighbouring areas, recruiting more locusts. Eventually they can become a marching army extending over many kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Uvarov | first = B. P. | year = 1977 | series = Grasshopper and locust: a handbook of general acridology | volume = II | title = Behaviour, ecology, biogeography, population dynamics | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be the prelude to the development of the vast flying adult locust swarms which devastate vegetation on a continental scale.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Symmons | first1 = P.M. | last2 = Cressman | first2 = K. | year = 2001 | url = http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/common/ecg/347_en_DLG1e.pdf | title = Desert locust guidelines: Biology and behaviour | publisher = [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] | location = Rome }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key predictions of the SPP model is that as the [[population density]] of a group increases, an abrupt transition occurs from individuals moving in relatively disordered and independent ways within the group to the group moving as a highly aligned whole.&lt;ref name="Huepe and Aldana"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huepe | first1 = A. | last2 = Aldana | first2 = M. | year = 2004 | url = http://lims.mech.northwestern.edu/~lynch/IGERT499/huepe-PRL2004.pdf | title = Intermittency and clustering in a system of self-driven particles | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 92 | issue = 16 | page = 168701 [4 pages] | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.168701 | bibcode=2004PhRvL..92p8701H | pmid=15169268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the case of young desert locusts, a trigger point should occur which turns disorganised and dispersed locusts into a coordinated marching army. When the critical population density is reached, the insects should start marching together in a stable way and in the same direction.

In 2006, a group of researchers examined how this model held up in the laboratory. Locusts were placed in a circular arena, and their movements were tracked with computer software. At low densities, below 18 locusts per square metre, the locusts mill about in a disordered way. At intermediate densities, they start falling into line and marching together, punctuated by abrupt but coordinated changes in direction. However, when densities reached a critical value at about 74 locusts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the locusts ceased making rapid and spontaneous changes in direction, and instead marched steadily in the same direction for the full eight hours of the experiment (see video on the left). This confirmed the behaviour predicted by the SPP models.&lt;ref name="Buhl et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buhl | first1 = J. | last2 = Sumpter | first2 = D. J. T. | last3 = Couzin | first3 = D. | last4 = Hale | first4 = J. J. | last5 = Despland | first5 = E. | last6 = Miller | first6 = E. R. | last7 = Simpson | first7 = S.

In the field, according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], the average density of marching bands is 50 locusts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (50 million locusts/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), with a typical range from 20 to 120 locusts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;{{rp|29}} The research findings discussed above demonstrate the dynamic instability that is present at the lower locust densities typical in the field, where marching groups randomly switch direction without any external perturbation. Understanding this phenomenon, together with the switch to fully coordinated marching at higher densities, is essential if the swarming of desert locusts is to be controlled.&lt;ref name="Buhl et al"/&gt;

===Bird landings===
[[File:The flock of starlings acting as a swarm. - geograph.org.uk - 124593.jpg|thumb|right|Flocks of birds can abruptly change their direction in unison, and then, just as suddenly, make a unanimous group decision to land&lt;ref name="Bhattacharya"/&gt;]]
Swarming animals, such as ants, bees, fish and birds, are often observed suddenly switching from one state to another. For example, birds abruptly switch from a flying state to a landing state. Or fish switch from schooling in one direction to schooling in another direction. Such state switches can occur with astonishing speed and synchronicity, as though all the members in the group made a unanimous decision at the same moment. Phenomena like these have long puzzled researchers.&lt;ref name="medicalnewstoday"&gt;{{cite pressrelease | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/201411.php | title = Self-Propelled Particle System Improves Understanding Of Behavioral Patterns | publisher = [[Medical News Today]] | date = 18 Sep 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Bhattacharya and Vicsek used an SPP model to analyse what is happening here. As a paradigm, they considered how flying birds arrive at a collective decision to make a sudden and synchronised change to land. The birds, such as the starlings in the image on the right, have no decision-making leader, yet the flock know exactly how to land in a unified way. The need for the group to land overrides deviating intentions by individual birds. The particle model found that the collective shift to landing depends on perturbations that apply to the individual birds, such as where the birds are in the flock.&lt;ref name= "Bhattacharya"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhattacharya | first1 = K. | last2 = Vicsek | first2 = T. | year = 2010 | arxiv = 1007.4453 | title = Collective decision making in cohesive flocks |bibcode = 2010NJPh...12i3019B |doi = 10.1088/1367-2630/12/9/093019 | volume=12 | journal=New Journal of Physics | pages=093019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is behaviour that can be compared with the way that sand avalanches, if it is piled up, before the point at which symmetric and carefully placed grains would avalanche, because the fluctuations become increasingly non-linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Somfai | first1 = E. | last2 = Czirok | first2 = A. | last3 = Vicsek | first3 = T. | year = 1994 | title = Power-law distribution of landslides in an experiment on the erosion of a granular pile | journal = [[Journal of Physics A|Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General]] | volume = 27 | issue = 20 | pages = L757–L763 | doi = 10.1088/0305-4470/27/20/001 | bibcode = 1994JPhA...27L.757S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Our main motivation was to better understand something which is puzzling and out there in nature, especially in cases involving the stopping or starting of a collective behavioural pattern in a group of people or animals ... We propose a simple model for a system whose members have the tendency to follow the others both in space and in their state of mind concerning a decision about stopping an activity. This is a very general model, which can be applied to similar situations."&lt;ref name="Bhattacharya"/&gt; The model could also be applied to a swarm of unmanned [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], to initiating a desired motion in a crowd of people, or to interpreting group patterns when stock market shares are bought or sold.&lt;ref name="himalayantimes"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Bird+flock+decision-making+revealed&amp;NewsID=257752 | title = Bird flock decision-making revealed | work = [[Himalayan Times]] | date = 2010-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Network Science}}

'''Similarity''' in network analysis occurs when two nodes (or other more elaborate structures) fall in the same equivalence class. 

There are three fundamental approaches to constructing measures of network similarity: structural equivalence, automorphic equivalence, and regular equivalence.&lt;ref name="NewmanNetworks"&gt;Newman, M.E.J. 2010. ''Networks: An Introduction.'' Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a hierarchy of the three equivalence concepts: any set of structural equivalences are also automorphic and regular equivalences. Any set of automorphic equivalences are also regular equivalences. Not all regular equivalences are necessarily automorphic or structural; and not all automorphic equivalences are necessarily structural.&lt;ref name="Hanneman Riddle 2005" /&gt;

== Visualizing similarity and distance ==

=== Clustering tools ===

Agglomerative [[Hierarchical clustering]] of nodes on the basis of the similarity of their profiles of ties to other nodes provides a joining tree or [[Dendrogram]] that visualizes the degree of similarity among cases - and can be used to find approximate equivalence classes.&lt;ref name="Hanneman Riddle 2005"&gt;Hanneman, Robert A. and Mark Riddle.  2005.  Introduction to social network methods.  Riverside, CA:  University of California, Riverside ( published in digital form at http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/ )&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi-dimensional scaling tools ===
{{main article|Multidimensional scaling}}

Usually our goal in equivalence analysis is to identify and visualize "classes" or clusters of cases.  In using cluster analysis, we are implicitly assuming that the similarity or distance among cases reflects as single underlying dimension.  It is possible, however, that there are multiple "aspects" or "dimensions" underlying the observed similarities of cases.  Factor or components analysis could be applied to correlations or covariances among cases.  Alternatively, multi-dimensional scaling could be used (non-metric for data that are inherently nominal or ordinal; metric for valued).&lt;ref name="Hanneman Riddle 2005" /&gt;

MDS represents the patterns of similarity or dissimilarity in the tie profiles among the actors (when applied to adjacency or distances) as a "map" in multi-dimensional space. This map lets us see how "close" actors are, whether they "cluster" in multi-dimensional space, and how much variation there is along each dimension.&lt;ref name="Hanneman Riddle 2005" /&gt;

== Structural equivalence ==
Two vertices of a network are structurally equivalent if they share many of the same neighbors. 

[[File:Structural_Equivalence.jpg|thumb|Structural equivalence]]

There is no actor who has exactly the same set of ties as actor A, so actor A is in a class by itself. The same is true for actors B, C, D and G.  Each of these nodes has a unique set of edges to other nodes. E and F, however, fall in the same structural equivalence class. Each has only one edge; and that tie is to B.  Since E and F have exactly the same pattern of edges with all the vertices, they are structurally equivalent. The same is true in the case of H and I.&lt;ref name="Hanneman Riddle 2005" /&gt;

Structural equivalence is the strongest form of similarity. In many real networks exact equivalence may be rare, and it could be useful to ease the criteria and measure approximate equivalence. 

A closely related concept is ''institutional equivalence'': two actors (e.g., firms) are institutionally equivalent if they operate in the same set of institutional fields.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquis|first=Christopher|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|date=2016-10-01|title=Institutional Equivalence: How Industry and Community Peers Influence Corporate Philanthropy|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|journal=Organization Science|volume=27|issue=5|pages=1325–1341|doi=10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|issn=1047-7039}}&lt;/ref&gt; While structurally equivalent actors have identical relational patterns or network positions, institutional equivalence captures the similarity of institutional influences that actors experience from being in the same fields, regardless of how similar their network  positions are. For example, two banks in Chicago might have very different patterns of ties (e.g., one may be a central node, and the other may be in a peripheral position) such that they are not  structural equivalents, but because they both operate in the field of finance and banking and in the same geographically defined field (Chicago), they will be subject to some of the same institutional influences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Measures for structural equivalence ===
==== Cosine similarity ====
{{main article|Cosine similarity}}

A simple count of common neighbors for two vertices is not on its own a very good measure. One should know the degree of the vertices or how many common neighbors other pairs of vertices has. [[Cosine similarity]] takes into account these regards and also allow for the varying degrees of vertices. Salton proposed that we regard the i-th and j-th rows/columns of the adjacency matrix as two vectors and use the cosine of the angle between them as a [[similarity measure]]. The cosine similarity of i and j is the number of common neighbors divided by the geometric mean of their degrees. &lt;ref&gt;Salton G., Automatic Text Processing: The Transformation, Analysis and Retrieval of Information by Computer, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Its value lies in the range from 0 to 1. The value of 1 indicates that the two vertices have exactly the same neighbors while the value of zero means that they do not have any common neighbors. Cosine similarity is technically undefined if one or both of the nodes has zero degree, but according to the convention we say that cosine similarity is 0 in these cases.&lt;ref name="NewmanNetworks"&gt;Newman, M.E.J. 2010. ''Networks: An Introduction.'' Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pearson coefficient ====
{{main article|Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient}}

[[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] is an alternative method to normalize the count of common neighbors. This method compares the number of common neighbors with the expected value that count would take in a network where vertices are connected randomly. This quantity lies strictly in the range from -1 to 1.&lt;ref name="NewmanNetworks"&gt;Newman, M.E.J. 2010. ''Networks: An Introduction.'' Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Euclidean distance ====
{{main article|Euclidean distance}}

[[Euclidean distance]] is equal to the number of neighbors that differ between two vertices. It is rather a dissimilarity measure, since it is larger for vertices which differ more. It could be normalized by dividing by its maximum value. The maximum means that there are no common neighbors, in which case the distance is equal to the sum of the degrees of the vertices.&lt;ref name="NewmanNetworks"&gt;Newman, M.E.J. 2010. ''Networks: An Introduction.'' Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automorphic equivalence == 

Formally "Two vertices are automorphically equivalent if all the vertices can be re-labeled to form an isomorphic graph with the labels of u and v interchanged. Two automorphically equivalent vertices share exactly the same label-independent properties."&lt;ref name="Borgatti Everett"&gt;Borgatti, Steven, Martin Everett, and Linton Freeman. 1992. UCINET IV Version 1.0 User's Guide. Columbia, SC: Analytic Technologies.&lt;/ref&gt;

More intuitively, actors are automorphically equivalent if we can permute the graph in such a way that exchanging the two actors has no effect on the distances among all actors in the graph.

[[File:Automorphic equivalence.jpg|thumb|Automorphic equivalence]]

Suppose the graph describes the organizational structure of a company.  Actor A is the central headquarter, actors B, C, and D are managers.  Actors E, F and H, I are workers at smaller stores; G is the lone worker at an other store.

Even though actor B and actor D are not structurally equivalent (they do have the same boss, but not the same workers), they do seem to be "equivalent" in a different sense.  Both manager B and D has a boss (in this case, the same boss), and each has two workers. If we swapped them, and also swapped the four workers, all of the distances among all the actors in the network would be exactly identical. 

There are actually five automorphic equivalence classes: {A}, {B, D}, {C}, {E, F, H, I}, and {G}. Note that the less strict definition of "equivalence" has reduced the number of classes.&lt;ref name="Hanneman Riddle 2005" /&gt;

== Regular equivalence == 

Formally, "Two actors are regularly equivalent if they are equally related to equivalent others." In other words, regularly equivalent vertices are vertices that, while they do not necessarily share neighbors, have neighbors who are themselves similar.&lt;ref name="Borgatti Everett" /&gt;

Two mothers, for example, are equivalent, because each has a similar pattern of connections with a husband, children, etc. The two mothers do not have ties to the same husband or the same children, so they are not structurally equivalent. Because different mothers may have different numbers of husbands and children, they will not be automorphically equivalent.  But they are similar because they have the same relationships with some member or members of another set of actors (who are themselves regarded as equivalent because of the similarity of their ties to a member of the set "mother").&lt;ref name="Hanneman Riddle 2005" /&gt;

[[File:Regular equivalence.jpg|thumb|Regular equivalence]]

In the graph there are three regular equivalence classes.  The first is actor A; the second is composed of the three actors B, C, and D; the third consists of the remaining five actors E, F, G, H, and I.

The easiest class to see is the five actors across the bottom of the diagram (E, F, G, H, and I). These actors are regularly equivalent to one another because:

# they have no tie with any actor in the first class (that is, with actor A) and  
# each has a tie with an actor in the second class (either B or C or D). 

Each of the five actors, then, has an identical pattern of ties with actors in the other classes.

Actors B, C, and D form a class similarly. B and D actually have ties with two members of the third class, whereas actor C has a tie to only one member of the third class, but this doesn't matter, as there is a tie to some member of the third class.

Actor A is in a class by itself, defined by:

# a tie to at least one member of class two and 
# no tie to any member of class three.&lt;ref name="Hanneman Riddle 2005" /&gt;

In [[nonlinear control]] theory, a [[non-linear system]] of the form &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = f(x,u)&lt;/math&gt; is said to satisfy the '''small control property''' if for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; so that for all &lt;math&gt;\|x\| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt; there exists a &lt;math&gt;\|u\| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; so that the time derivative of the system's [[Lyapunov function]] is negative definite at that point.

In other words, even if the control input is arbitrarily small, a starting configuration close enough to the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] of the system can be found that is asymptotically stabilizable by such an input.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5600">In mathematics, '''Specht's theorem''' gives a [[necessary and sufficient condition]] for two [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] to be [[Matrix_similarity|unitarily equivalent]]. It is named after [[Wilhelm Specht]], who proved the theorem in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Specht|1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two matrices ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be ''unitarily equivalent'' if there exists a [[unitary matrix]] ''U'' such that ''B'' = ''U''&amp;thinsp;*''AU''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985}}, Definition 2.2.1&lt;/ref&gt; Two matrices which are unitarily equivalent are also [[similar matrices|similar]]. Two similar matrices represent the same [[linear map]], but with respect to a different [[basis of a vector space|basis]]; unitary equivalence corresponds to a change from an [[orthonormal basis]] to another orthonormal basis. 

If ''A'' and ''B'' are unitarily equivalent, then tr ''AA''* = tr ''BB''*, where tr denotes the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] (in other words, the [[Frobenius norm]] is a unitary invariant). This follows from the cyclic invariance of the trace: if ''B'' = ''U''&amp;thinsp;*''AU'', then tr ''BB''* = tr ''U''&amp;thinsp;*''AUU''&amp;thinsp;*''A''*''U'' = tr ''AUU''&amp;thinsp;*''A''*''UU''&amp;thinsp;* = tr ''AA''*, where the second equality is cyclic invariance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985}}, Theorem 2.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus, tr ''AA''* = tr ''BB''* is a necessary condition for unitary equivalence, but it is not sufficient. Specht's theorem gives infinitely many necessary conditions which together are also sufficient. The formulation of the theorem uses the following definition. A [[word (mathematics)|word]] in two variables, say ''x'' and ''y'', is an expression of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
W(x,y) = x^{m_1} y^{n_1} x^{m_2} y^{n_2} \cdots x^{m_p},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; are non-negative integers. The ''degree'' of this word is

:&lt;math&gt; 
m_1 + n_1 + m_2 + n_2 + \cdots + m_p.
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Specht's theorem:''' Two matrices ''A'' and ''B'' are unitarily equivalent if and only if tr ''W''(''A'', ''A''*) = tr ''W''(''B'', ''B''*) for all words ''W''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985}}, Theorem 2.2.6&lt;/ref&gt; 

The theorem gives an infinite number of trace identities, but it can be reduced to a finite subset. Let ''n'' denote the size of the matrices ''A'' and ''B''. For the case ''n'' = 2, the following three conditions are sufficient:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985}}, Theorem 2.2.8&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{tr} \, A = \operatorname{tr} \, B, \quad 
\operatorname{tr} \, A^2 = \operatorname{tr} \, B^2, \quad\text{and}\quad
\operatorname{tr} \, AA^* = \operatorname{tr} \, BB^*.
&lt;/math&gt;

For ''n'' = 3, the following seven conditions are sufficient:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
&amp;\operatorname{tr} \, A = \operatorname{tr} \, B, \quad 
\operatorname{tr} \, A^2 = \operatorname{tr} \, B^2, \quad
\operatorname{tr} \, AA^* = \operatorname{tr} \, BB^*, \quad
\operatorname{tr} \, A^3 = \operatorname{tr} \, B^3, \\
&amp;\operatorname{tr} \, A^2 A^* = \operatorname{tr} \, B^2 B^*, \quad
\operatorname{tr} \, A^2 (A^*)^2 = \operatorname{tr} \, B^2 (B^*)^2, \quad\text{and}\quad
\operatorname{tr} \, A^2 (A^*)^2 A A^* = \operatorname{tr} \, B^2 (B^*)^2 B B^*.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sibirskiǐ|1976}}, p. 260, quoted by {{harvtxt|Đoković|Johnson|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For general ''n'', it suffices to show that tr ''W''(''A'', ''A''*) = tr ''W''(''B'', ''B''*) for all words of degree at most 

:&lt;math&gt;
n \sqrt{\frac{2n^2}{n-1} + \frac14} + \frac{n}2 - 2.
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pappacena|1997}}, Theorem 4.3&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has been conjectured that this can be reduced to an expression linear in ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freedman|Gupta|Guralnick|1997}}, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6584">In [[combinatorics]], a '''Sperner family''' (or '''Sperner system'''), named in honor of [[Emanuel Sperner]], is a [[family of sets]] ('''''F''''', ''E'') in which none of the sets is contained in another.  Equivalently, a Sperner family is an [[antichain]] in the inclusion [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] over the [[power set]] of ''E''.  A Sperner family is also sometimes called an '''independent system''' or a '''clutter'''.

Sperner families are counted by the [[Dedekind number]]s, and their size is bounded by [[Sperner's theorem]] and the [[Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality]]. They may also be described in the language of [[hypergraph]]s rather than set families, where they are called '''clutters'''.

==Dedekind numbers==
{{main|Dedekind number}}

The number of different Sperner families on a set of ''n'' elements is counted by the [[Dedekind number]]s, the first few of which are
:2, 3, 6, 20, 168, 7581, 7828354, 2414682040998, 56130437228687557907788 {{OEIS|id=A000372}}.
Although accurate [[asymptotic expansion|asymptotic]] estimates are known for larger values of ''n'', it is unknown whether there exists an exact formula that can be used to compute these numbers efficiently.

==Bounds on the size of a Sperner family==

=== Sperner's theorem ===
{{main|Sperner's theorem}}
The ''k''-element subsets of an ''n''-element set form a Sperner family, the size of which is maximized when ''k'' = ''n''/2 (or the nearest integer to it).
[[Sperner's theorem]] states that these families are the largest possible Sperner families over an ''n''-element set. Formally, the theorem states that, for every Sperner family ''S'' over an ''n''-element set,

:&lt;math&gt;|S| \le \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}.&lt;/math&gt;

===LYM inequality===
{{main|Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality}}

The [[Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality]] provides another bound on the size of a Sperner family, and can be used to prove Sperner's theorem.
It states that, if ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the number of sets of size ''k'' in a Sperner family over a set of ''n'' elements, then
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{a_k}{{n \choose k}} \le 1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Clutters==
A '''clutter''' ''H'' is a [[hypergraph]] &lt;math&gt;(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;, with the added property that &lt;math&gt;A \not\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;A,B \in E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \neq B&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. no edge properly contains another).  That is, the sets of vertices represented by the hyperedges form a Sperner family. Clutters are an important structure in the study of combinatorial optimization.  An opposite notion to a clutter is an [[abstract simplicial complex]], where every subset of an edge is contained in the hypergraph (this is an [[order ideal]] in the poset of subsets of ''E'').

If &lt;math&gt;H = (V,E)&lt;/math&gt; is a clutter, then the '''blocker''' of ''H'', denoted &lt;math&gt;b(H)&lt;/math&gt;, is the clutter with vertex set ''V'' and edge set consisting of all minimal sets &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq V&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;B \cap A \neq \varnothing&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;A \in E&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;b(b(H)) = H&lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Edmonds|Fulkerson|1970}}, so blockers give us a type of duality.  We define &lt;math&gt;\nu(H)&lt;/math&gt; to be the size of the largest collection of disjoint edges in ''H'' and &lt;math&gt;\tau(H)&lt;/math&gt; to be the size of the smallest edge in &lt;math&gt;b(H)&lt;/math&gt;.    It is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\nu(H) \le \tau(H)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Examples ===
# If ''G'' is a simple loopless graph, then &lt;math&gt;H = (V(G),E(G))&lt;/math&gt; is a clutter and &lt;math&gt;b(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the collection of all minimal [[vertex cover]]s.  Here &lt;math&gt;\nu(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the largest matching and &lt;math&gt;\tau(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the smallest vertex cover. [[Kőnig's theorem (graph theory)|Kőnig's theorem]] states that, for [[bipartite graph]]s, &lt;math&gt;\nu(H) = \tau(H)&lt;/math&gt;. However for other graphs these two quantities may differ.
# Let ''G'' be a graph and let &lt;math&gt;s,t \in V(G)&lt;/math&gt;.  Define &lt;math&gt;H = (V,E)&lt;/math&gt; by setting &lt;math&gt;V = E(G)&lt;/math&gt; and letting ''E'' be the collection of all edge-sets of ''s''-''t'' paths.  Then ''H'' is a clutter, and &lt;math&gt;b(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the collection of all minimal edge cuts which separate ''s'' and ''t''.  In this case &lt;math&gt;\nu(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum number of edge-disjoint ''s''-''t'' paths, and &lt;math&gt;\tau(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the smallest edge-cut separating ''s'' and ''t'', so [[Menger's theorem]] (edge-connectivity version) asserts that &lt;math&gt;\nu(H) = \tau(H)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let ''G'' be a connected graph and let ''H'' be the clutter on &lt;math&gt;E(G)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of all edge sets of spanning trees of ''G''.  Then &lt;math&gt;b(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the collection of all minimal edge cuts in ''G''.

=== Minors ===
There is a minor relation on clutters which is similar to the [[minor (graph theory)|minor relation]] on graphs.  If &lt;math&gt;H = (V,E)&lt;/math&gt; is a clutter and &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then we may '''delete''' ''v'' to get the clutter &lt;math&gt;H \setminus v&lt;/math&gt; with vertex set &lt;math&gt;
V \setminus \{v\}&lt;/math&gt; and edge set consisting of all &lt;math&gt;A \in E&lt;/math&gt; which do not contain ''v''.  We '''contract''' ''v'' to get the clutter &lt;math&gt;H / v = b(b(H) \setminus v)&lt;/math&gt;.  These two operations commute, and if ''J'' is another clutter, we say that ''J'' is a '''minor''' of ''H'' if a clutter isomorphic to ''J'' may be obtained from ''H'' by a sequence of deletions and contractions.

In mathematical analysis, '''Tannery's theorem''' gives sufficient conditions for the [[Interchange of limiting operations|interchanging of the limit and infinite summation operations]]. It is named after [[Jules Tannery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Loya |first1=Paul |title=Amazing and Aesthetic Aspects of Analysis |date=2018 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781493967957 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q45aDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;ots=EU7LjUPeZ4&amp;dq=Tannery's%20theorem&amp;pg=PA216#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proofs ==
Tannery's theorem follows directly from Lebesgue's [[dominated convergence theorem]] applied to the [[sequence space]] ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

An elementary proof can also be given.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Example ==
Tannery theorem can be used to prove that the binomial limit and the infinite series [[Characterizations of the exponential function|characterizations of the exponential]] &lt;math&gt; e^x &lt;/math&gt;are equivalent. Note that 

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n =
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} \frac{x^k}{n^k}. &lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt; a_k(n) =   {n \choose k} \frac{x^k}{n^k} &lt;/math&gt;.   We have that &lt;math&gt; |a_k(n)| \leq \frac{|x|^k}{k!} &lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{|x|^k}{k!} = e^{|x|} &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;, so Tannery's theorem can be applied and

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \sum_{k=0}^\infty {n \choose k} \frac{x^k}{n^k}
=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} {n \choose k} \frac{x^k}{n^k}
=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!}
= e^x.  &lt;/math&gt;

In [[model theory]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''type''' is an object that, loosely speaking, describes how a (real or possible) element or elements in a [[structure (mathematical logic)|mathematical structure]] might behave.  More precisely, it is a set of [[First-order logic|first-order]] formulas in a language ''L'' with free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; that are true of a sequence of elements of an ''L''-structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.  Depending on the context, types can be '''complete''' or '''partial''' and they may use a fixed set of constants, ''A'', from the structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.  The question of which types represent actual elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; leads to the ideas of [[saturated model]]s and '''omitting types'''.

==Formal definition==
Consider a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; for a [[Formal language|language]] ''L''.  Let ''M'' be the [[Structure (mathematical logic)#Domain|universe]] of the structure. For every ''A''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''M'', let ''L''(''A'') be the language obtained from ''L'' by adding a constant ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''a''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A''. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;L(A) = L \cup \{c_a : a \in A\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''1-type (of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;) over''' ''A'' is a set ''p''(''x'') of formulas in ''L''(''A'') with at most one free variable ''x'' (therefore 1-type) such that for every finite subset ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''p''(''x'') there is some ''b''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M'', depending on ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), with &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \models p_0(b) &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. all formulas in ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are true in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; when ''x'' is replaced by ''b'').

Similarly an '''''n''-type (of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;) over''' ''A'' is defined to be a set ''p''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''('''''x''''') of formulas in ''L''(''A''), each having its free variables occurring only among the given ''n'' free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, such that for every finite subset ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''''x''''')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''p''('''''x''''') there are some elements ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M'' with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\models p_0(b_1,\ldots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Complete type''' refers to those types that are [[maximal consistent set|maximal]] with respect to inclusion, i.e. if ''p''('''''x''''') is a complete type, then for every &lt;math&gt;\phi(\boldsymbol{x}) \in L(A,\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt; either &lt;math&gt; \phi(\boldsymbol{x}) \in p(\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt;  or  &lt;math&gt;\lnot\phi(\boldsymbol{x}) \in p(\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt;. Any non-complete type is called a '''partial type'''. 
So, the word '''type''' in general refers to any ''n''-type, partial or complete, over any chosen set of parameters (possibly the empty set).

An ''n''-type ''p''('''''x''''') is said to be {{anchor|realizationOfTypes}}'''realized in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;''' if there is an element '''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\models p(\boldsymbol{b})&lt;/math&gt;. The existence of such a realization is guaranteed for any type by the [[Compactness theorem]], although the realization might take place in some [[elementary extension]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, rather than in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; itself. 
If a complete type is realized by '''''b''''' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, then the type is typically denoted &lt;math&gt;tp_n^{\mathcal{M}}(\boldsymbol{b}/A)&lt;/math&gt; and referred to as '''the complete type of ''b'' over''' ''A''.

A type ''p''('''''x''''') is said to be '''isolated by ''φ''''', for &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in p(x)&lt;/math&gt;, if  &lt;math&gt;\forall \psi(\boldsymbol{x}) \in p(\boldsymbol{x}), \varphi(\boldsymbol{x}) \rightarrow \psi(\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt;. Since finite subsets of a type are always realized in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, there is always an element '''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''φ''('''''b''''') is true in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;; i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \models \varphi(\boldsymbol{b})&lt;/math&gt;, thus '''''b''''' realizes the entire isolated type. So isolated types will be realized in every elementary substructure or extension. Because of this, isolated types can never be omitted (see below).

A model that realizes the maximum possible variety of types is called a [[saturated model]], and the [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]] construction provides one way of producing saturated models.

==Examples of types==
Consider the language with one binary connective, which we denote as &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be the structure &lt;math&gt;\langle \omega, \in_{\omega}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for this language, which is the ordinal &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; with its standard well-ordering. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; denote the theory of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider the set of formulas &lt;math&gt;p(x):=\{ n\in_{\omega} x \mid n \in \omega\} &lt;/math&gt;. First, we claim this is a type. Let &lt;math&gt;p_0(x)\subseteq p(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a finite subset of &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;. We need to find an &lt;math&gt;b\in\omega&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies all the formulas in &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;. Well, we can just take the successor of the largest ordinal mentioned in the set of formulas &lt;math&gt;p_0(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then this will clearly contain all the ordinals mentioned in &lt;math&gt;p_0(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have that &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a type. 
Next, note that &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not realized in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. For, if it were there would be some &lt;math&gt;n\in\omega&lt;/math&gt; that contains every element of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. 
If we wanted to realize the type, we might be tempted to consider the model &lt;math&gt;\langle \omega+1,\in_{\omega+1}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, which is indeed a supermodel of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; that realizes the type. Unfortunately, this extension is not elementary, that is this model does not have to satisfy &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the sentence &lt;math&gt;\exists x \forall y (y\in x \lor y=x)&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied by this model and not by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

So, we wish to realize the type in an elementary extension. We can do this by defining a new structure in this language, which we will denote &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}'&lt;/math&gt;. The domain of the structure will be &lt;math&gt;\omega \cup \mathbb{Z}'&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}'&lt;/math&gt; is the set of integers adorned in such a way that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}'\cap\omega=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; denote the usual order of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}'&lt;/math&gt;. We interpret the symbol &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; in our new structure by &lt;math&gt;\in_{\mathcal{M}'} = \in_{\omega} \cup &lt; \cup \,(\omega \times \mathbb{Z}')&lt;/math&gt;. The idea being that we are adding a "Z-chain", or copy of the integers, above all the finite ordinals. Clearly any element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}'&lt;/math&gt; realizes the type &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, one can verify that this extension is elementary.

Another example: the complete type of the number 2 over the emptyset, considered as a member of the natural numbers, would be the set of all first-order statements describing a variable ''x'' that are true for ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. This set would include formulas such as &lt;math&gt;\,\!x\ne 1+1+1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\le 1+1+1+1+1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\exists y(y&lt;x)&lt;/math&gt;. This is an example of an isolated type, since the formula &lt;math&gt;x = 1+1&lt;/math&gt; implies all other formulas that are true about the number 2.

For example, the statements

:&lt;math&gt;\forall y(y^2&lt;2 \implies y&lt;x)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\forall y((y&gt;0 \land y^2&gt;2) \implies y&gt;x)&lt;/math&gt;

describing the [[square root of 2]] are consistent with the axioms of [[ordered field]]s, and can be extended to a complete type. This type is not realized in the ordered field of rational numbers, but is realized in the ordered field of reals. Similarly, the infinite set of formulas (over the emptyset) {x&gt;1, x&gt;1+1, x&gt;1+1+1, ...} is not realized in the ordered field of real numbers, but is realized in the ordered field of [[hyperreals]]. If we allow more parameters, for instance all of the reals, we can specify a type &lt;math&gt;\{ 0 &lt; x &lt; r : r \in \mathbb{R} \}&lt;/math&gt; that is realized by an [[infinitesimal]] hyperreal that violates the [[Archimedean property]].

The reason it is useful to restrict the parameters to a certain subset of the model is that it helps to distinguish the types that can be satisfied from those that cannot. For example, using the entire set of real numbers as parameters one could generate an uncountably infinite set of formulas like &lt;math&gt;x\ne 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\ne \pi&lt;/math&gt;, ... that would explicitly rule out every possible real value for ''x'', and therefore could never be realized within the real numbers.

==Stone spaces==

It is useful to consider the set of complete ''n''-types over ''A'' as a [[topological space]]. Consider the following equivalence relation on formulae in the free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with parameters in ''M'':
:&lt;math&gt;\psi \equiv \phi \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{M} \models \forall x_1,\ldots,x_n (\psi(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \leftrightarrow \phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)).&lt;/math&gt;
One can show that &lt;math&gt;\psi \equiv \phi&lt;/math&gt; iff they are contained in exactly the same complete types.

The set of formulae in free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; over ''A'' up to this equivalence relation is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] (and is canonically isomorphic to the set of ''A''-definable subsets of ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;). The complete ''n''-types correspond to [[ultrafilter]]s of this boolean algebra. The set of complete ''n''-types can be made into a topological space by taking the sets of types containing a given formula as basic open sets. This constructs the [[Stone space]], which is [[compact space|compact]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]].

'''Example'''. The complete theory of [[algebraically closed field]]s of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0 has [[quantifier elimination]], which allows one to show that the possible complete 1-types correspond to:
*[[root of a function|Root]]s of a given [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible non-constant polynomial]] over the rationals with leading coefficient 1. For example, the type of square roots of 2. Each of these types is an open point of the Stone space.
*Transcendental elements, that are not roots of any non-zero polynomial. This type is a point in the Stone space that is closed but not open.
In other words, the 1-types correspond exactly to the prime ideals of the polynomial ring '''Q'''[''x''] over the rationals '''Q''': if ''r'' is an element of the model of type ''p'', then the ideal corresponding to ''p'' is the set of polynomials with ''r'' as a root. More generally, the complete ''n''-types correspond to the prime ideals of the polynomial ring '''Q'''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], in other words to the points of the [[prime spectrum]] of this ring. (The Stone space topology can in fact be viewed as the Zariski topology of a Boolean ring induced in a natural way from the lattice structure of the Boolean Algebra; while the Zariski topology is not in general Hausdorff, it is in the case of Boolean rings.) For example, if ''q''(''x'',''y'') is an irreducible polynomial in 2 variables, there is a 2-type whose realizations are (informally) pairs (''x'',''y'') of transcendental elements with ''q''(''x'',''y'')=0.

==The omitting types theorem==

Given a complete ''n''-type ''p'' one can ask if there is a model of the theory that '''omits''' ''p'', in other words there is no ''n''-tuple in the model that realizes ''p''. 
If ''p'' is an [[isolated point]] in the Stone space, i.e. if {''p''} is an open set, it is easy to see that every model realizes ''p'' (at least if the theory is complete). The '''omitting types theorem''' says that conversely if ''p'' is not isolated then there is a countable model omitting ''p'' (provided that the language is countable).

'''Example''': In the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0, there is a 1-type represented by elements that are transcendental over the prime field. This is a non-isolated point of the Stone space (in fact, the only non-isolated point). The field of algebraic numbers is a model omitting this type, and the algebraic closure of any 
transcendental extension of the rationals is a model realizing this type.

All the other types are "algebraic numbers" (more precisely, they are the sets of first order statements satisfied by some given algebraic number), and all such types are realized in all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0.

The '''Ulam–Warburton [[cellular automaton]]''' is a 2-dimensional [[fractal]] pattern that grows on a regular square grid.

Starting with one square initially ON and all others OFF successive iterations are generated by turning ON all squares that share precisely one edge with an ON square.

The automaton is named after the Polish-American scientist and mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Stanislaw_Ulam|S.M. Ulam]], On some mathematical problems connected with patterns of growth of figures, Mathematical Problems in Biological Sciences, 14 (1962), 215–224.
&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scottish engineer, inventor and amateur mathematician Mike Warburton. &lt;ref&gt; M. Warburton, One-edge connections, [http://m500.org.uk/magazine/ M500 Magazine of The Open University], '''[http://m500.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/M188WEB.pdf 188]''' (2002), 11 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[David_Singmaster|D. Singmaster]], On the cellular automaton of Ulam and Warburton, [http://m500.org.uk/magazine/ M500 Magazine of The Open University], '''[http://m500.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/M195WEB.pdf 195]''' (2003), 2–7&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Properties and relations ==
The sequence of the number of squares turned ON in each iteration starts 1, 4, 4, 12, 4, 12, 12, 36, 4, … This is referenced as [https://oeis.org/A147582 A147582] in the online [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]]. If we let &lt;math&gt; u(n),&lt;/math&gt; be the number of squares turned ON in each iteration we have an explicit formula: &lt;math&gt;u(0)=0, u(1)=1,&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt; n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; u(n) = 4 \cdot 3^{wt(n-1)-1} = \frac{4}{3}\cdot 3^{wt(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;wt&lt;/math&gt; is the binary [[Hamming weight]] function. &lt;ref&gt; {{Cite journal | arxiv=1004.3036| last1=[[David Applegate|Applegate]]| first1=David| title=The Toothpick Sequence and Other Sequences from Cellular Automata| journal=Congressus Numerant| volume=206| pages=157–191| last2=Pol| first2=Omar E.| last3=[[Neil Sloane |Sloane]]| first3=N. J. A.| year=2010}}  &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ulam Warburton -Total number of squares U(n).jpg|thumb|350px|right|Total number of ON cells in the Ulam–Warburton [[cellular automaton]]]]

The sequence of the total number of squares turned ON is denoted &lt;math&gt;U(n)&lt;/math&gt; and starts 1, 5, 9, 21, 25, 37, 49, 85, 89, ... OEIS reference [https://oeis.org/A147562 A147562]

: &lt;math&gt;U(n)=\sum_{i \mathop =1}^n u(i)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;U(n)&lt;/math&gt; has [[fractal]]-like behavior with a [[Upper_and_lower_bounds|sharp upper bound]] for &lt;math&gt; n\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U_\text{sub}(n)=\frac{4}{3}n^2-\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

The upper bound only contacts &lt;math&gt;U(n)&lt;/math&gt; at 'high-water' points when &lt;math&gt;n=2^k&lt;/math&gt;.
These are also the generations at which the Ulam–Warburton cellular automaton, based on squares, the Hex–Ulam–Warburton cellular automaton, based on hexagons and the [[Sierpinski triangle]]  return to their base shape.&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Khovanova, Eric Nie, Alok Puranik, The Pioneering Role of the Sierpinski Gasket. Math Horizons, 23(1), 5–9 (2015),[[arXiv]]:[https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5937 1408.5937]&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to the UW-cellular automaton is the [[toothpick sequence]] and various toothpick-like sequences which can be explored [http://oeis.org/A139250/a139250.anim.html here].
 
The classic game of [[Nim]] and a related impartial combinatorial ruleset called LIM are also connected with the Ulam–Warburton cellular automaton in interesting and surprising ways.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Fink, Avierzri S. Fraenkel, Carlos Santos, LIM is not slim. International Journal of Game Theory, 2014, vol. 43, issue 2, 269–281 &lt;/ref&gt;
