Grosvenor Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Korbelik, Jeff. "Did I hear that right?", ''[[Lincoln Journal Star]]'', 2007-01-16.&lt;/ref&gt; (born July 7, 1972, known as Chucky G) The site was first launched March 23, 2000 &lt;ref name="SiteFounding"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20001019054249/http://www.amiright.com/whatsnew.shtml Wayback history page] Original What's New Page&lt;/ref&gt; and has since grown considerably.

Am I Right is a community based website, with all the content contained on the website created by visitors. New material is submitted online by individuals and reviewed by a group of "editors" who remove entries that don't conform to community standards regarding obscene content or [[spam (electronic)|spam]].

In 2006, a sister site called '''Am I Wrong''' was opened which allows the users to create their own quiz.

== Sections of the website ==

=== Misheard lyrics ===
Since the website's inception, the site has offered the possibility for visitors to submit misheard lyrics, aka "[[mondegreen]]s", to the site; these are displayed along with the true lyrics. As of October 11, 2007, there are a total of 101,716 misheard lyrics.&lt;ref name="Parodystats"&gt;[http://amiright.com/ Website statistics] Retrieved October 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; There is a section where contributors admit their more embarrassing misheard lyric mishaps and the moment they came upon their mistakes. Another section associated with misheard lyrics includes "Misheard Lyrics in Film", where visitors recall moments where actors or actresses recall lyrics as misquoted by actors in either film or television from famous songs.

=== Comedy recordings ===
The recordings section is for recorded performances of parodies or other musical comedy pieces.  Am I Right does not host the files, so the section is essentially an index of other sites that contain recordings. All entries in this section are submitted to the site by the original authors.

=== Album cover parodies ===
A recent addition to the site, the Album Cover parody section lets people humorously [[Image manipulation|edit]] an [[album cover]] from an original artist's album, thanks to [[Amazon.com]]'s Music section.

=== Music trivia ===
This section is focused on strange and funny facts about various songs and performers. Most pages consist of songs of performers that have certain commonalities in common such as songs that have been banned, performers that have [[criminal record]]s, or songs that have backwards messages recorded in them.

=== Names ===
This section deals with band name origins,&lt;ref&gt;"What to browse when the boss isn't looking", ''[[Evening Standard]]'', 2007-01-08, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; pseudonyms, names of the offspring of famous musicians, song and band name parodies, user-created band names, inventive [[portmanteau]]x of individual band or performer names, inappropriate commercial soundtrack selections, proposed duets, inappropriate songs to play while on hold, adding, removing, or changing letters from titles to create new titles, lyrics that are literally impossible, and the use of song titles as questions and answers.

=== Real lyrics ===
The "real lyrics" section contains lyrics that fit certain categories, such as those which are "Misrhymed", "Insincere", or "Dirty".

== Publications ==
Two books which each gather over 500 misheard lyrics submitted to the site have been published.
''Hold Me Closer Tony Danza (and Other Misheard Lyrics)'' (October 28, 2007). [[Charles R. Grosvenor Jr]], [[Sasquatch Books]], {{ISBN|1-57061-533-0}} and ''Hit Me With Your Pet Shark (and Other Misheard Lyrics)'' (October 1, 2008). [[Charles R. Grosvenor Jr]], [[Sasquatch Books]], {{ISBN|1-57061-576-4}}

Each book has several pages with information pulled from the various sections of the site including:&lt;ref name="Hold Me Closer Tony Danza Book info"&gt;[http://www.amiright.com/misheard/lyrics-book.shtml Hold Me Closer Tony Danza Book info] List of book sections and sample pages&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Original goals ===
ASJP was originally developed as a means for objectively evaluating the similarity of words with the same meaning from different languages, with the ultimate goal of classifying languages computationally, based on the lexical similarities observed. In the first ASJP paper&lt;ref name="BrownCecil" /&gt; two [[Semantics|semantically]] identical words from compared languages were judged similar if they showed at least two identical sound segments. Similarity between the two languages was calculated as a percentage of the total number of words compared that were judged as similar. This method was applied to 100-item word lists for 250 languages from [[language families]] including [[Austroasiatic]], [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], and [[Muskogean]].

=== ASJP Consortium ===
The ASJP Consortium, founded around 2008,{{when|date=June 2018}} came to involve around 25 professional linguists and other interested parties working as volunteer transcribers and/or extending aid to the project in other ways. The main driving force behind the founding of the consortium was Cecil H. Brown. [[Søren Wichmann]] is daily curator of the project. A third central member of the consortium is Eric W. Holman, who has created most of the software used in the project.

=== Shorter word lists ===
While word lists used were originally based on the 100-item [[Swadesh list]], it was statistically determined that a subset of 40 of the 100 items produced just as good if not slightly better classificatory results than the whole list.&lt;ref&gt;Holman, Eric W., Søren Wichmann, Cecil H. Brown, Viveka Velupillai, André Müller, and Dik Bakker. 2008. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Soren_Wichmann/publication/40853552_Explorations_in_automated_language_classification/links/09e41508a4943d4255000000.pdf Explorations in automated language classification]. ''Folia Linguistica'' 42.2: 331-354.&lt;/ref&gt; So subsequently word lists gathered contain only 40 items (or less, when attestations for some are lacking).

=== Levenshtein Distance ===
In papers published since 2008, ASJP has employed a similarity judgment program based on [[Levenshtein distance]] (LD). This approach was found to produce better classificatory results measured against expert opinion than the method used initially. LD is defined as the minimum number of successive changes necessary to convert one word into another, where each change is the insertion, deletion, or substitution of a symbol. Within the Levenshtein approach, differences in word length can be corrected for by dividing LD by the number of symbols of the longer of the two compared words. This produces normalized LD (LDN). An LDN divided (LDND) between the two languages is calculated by dividing the average LDN for all the word pairs involving the same meaning by the average LDN for all the word pairs involving different meanings. This second normalization is intended to correct for chance similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Søren, Eric W. Holman, Dik Bakker, and Cecil H. Brown. 2010. Evaluating linguistic distance measures. ''Physica A'' 389: 3632-3639 (doi:10.1016/j.physa.2010.05.011).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Word list ==
The ASJP uses the following 40-word list.&lt;ref&gt;http://asjp.clld.org/static/Guidelines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to the [[Swadesh list#Shorter lists|Swadesh–Yakhontov list]], but has some differences.

[[File:Brevis Commentarivs,p15.png|thumb|300px|right|The catchword (in this case the last three letters of a divided word) is at the bottom of the page]]
A '''catchword''' is a [[word]] placed at the foot of a handwritten or [[Printing|printed]] page that is meant to be bound along with other pages in a book. The word anticipates the first word of the following page. It was meant to help the [[bookbinder]] or printer make sure that the leaves were bound in the right order or that the pages were set up in the press in the right order. Catchwords appear in some medieval manuscripts, and appear again in printed books late in the fifteenth century. The practice became widespread in the mid sixteenth century, and prevailed until the arrival of industrial printing techniques late in the eighteenth century.

Theodore Low Devinne's 1901 guide on ''Correct Composition'' had this to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For more than three centuries printers of books appended at the foot of every page the first word or syllable of the next page. This catchword was supposed to be needed by the reader to make clear the connection between the two pages&amp;nbsp;;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;but the catchword is now out of use, and it is not missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6713">'''Cerro Palenque''' is an archaeological site in the department of [[Cortés (department)|Cortés]] in [[Honduras]]. The city was founded in the Late Classic (500-800 AD) but reached its peak population and grew to over 500 structures in the Terminal Classic (850-1100 AD).

Archaeologists cannot determine how the people who lived at Cerro Palenque would have identified themselves since unlike the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of [[Copan]] and far western Honduras, they left no writing.  Over the years archaeologists have tried to ascertain the identity of the people who lived on the lower [[Ulua River|Ulua river]] drainage at various times in terms of populations known to have existed at the time of the Spanish conquest (1536).  Popular candidates include the [[Jicaque people|Tol]] (formerly Jicaque), [[Lenca people|Lenca]], and [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. Unfortunately, archaeologists cannot currently determine if it was one of these groups, or some other unnamed group.

== Location and context ==
The site today is found on top of the hill known as Cerro Palenque (232 meters above sea level), above the town of Santiago, near the confluence of the Ulua, Humuya (Comayagua) and Blanco rivers, and on several hilltops to the north.  It is located some 40 kilometers from the city of [[San Pedro Sula]] in Honduras.

The first part of the site to be settled was on the top of the hill, Cerro Palenque, and along its sides.  This part was developed in the Late Classic (500 to 800 AD) and remained fairly small, but impressive.  In the Terminal Classic (850-1100 AD) the city moved to the lower hill tops north of Cerro Palenque.  In the Terminal Classic, this was the largest city in the lower Ulua river valley.

Because of its location where the major rivers enter the valley from the south and southwest, Cerro Palenque was in a strategic position where it could have mediated access from the interior of the country to goods produced along the coast, and coming in trade with Belize and Yucatan.

The Maya of Yucatan told the Spanish, in the 16th century, that the [[Ulua River]] valley was the land of feathers and honey.  They also valued it for its chocolate (cacao). Pottery, and other kinds of artifacts, tell us that there was trade between various cities in the Ulua river valley, and the Maya of [[Belize]] and [[Yucatan]] because artifacts from these Maya centers have been found in cities in the valley at this time, and in turn, artifacts made in the valley have turned up in Maya cities in Belize and Yucatan.

The valley is formed by the Ulúa, Comayagua, and Chamelecón rivers, which provided natural transport routes into the rest of present Honduras as well as Central America. The [[Gulf of Honduras]] facilitated easy access to [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] and [[Belize]]. The valley was agriculturally fertile, and had access through nearby supplies or long distance exchange to luxury goods like [[spondylus]] and other marine shells, copper (in the postClassic), feathers (especially [[quetzal]]), [[obsidian]], [[jade]], and [[turquoise]].

== Excavations and findings ==
The fact that there were ruins on the top of Cerro Palenque has been known for a long time.  Its first mention may be in ''A Ladies Ride across Spanish Honduras'' published in 1884.

[[Dorothy Popenoe]] excavated at the Late Classic portion of Cerro Palenque in the 1920s but died before she published the results of her excavations.  [[Doris Stone]] included her analysis of the materials Popenoe excavated in her Archaeology of the North Coast of Honduras (1941)

In 1979, [[John S. Henderson]] began a project authorized by the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History ([[Instituto Hondureño de Antropología e Historia]] - IHAH) to survey and test more than 2400 square kilometers of the valley, to record all of the archaeological sites within it, and perform a series of excavations to understand the chronology of settlement (who lived where, when).  In this context, [[Rosemary A. Joyce]] did survey work and rediscovered the site.  As part of her dissertation fieldwork, she mapped, and excavated at Cerro Palenque in 1982 and 1983.  Her dissertation, and the book listed below are some of the results from that work.  Most recently, [[Julia Hendon]] has been conducting excavations in the elite residential groups off the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]].

The earliest settlement of this city, in the site called CR-44, atop Cerro Palenque itself, is Late Classic (500-850 AD).  As a new city center was built to the north, this part of the site was abandoned. The new center was on top of a lower set of hills north of Cerro Palenque in the Terminal Classic (850-1100 AD).  This new center includes a 300 meter long plaza and a large ball-court. There are also the remains of two causeways leading to residential groups off the main plaza. In the Terminal Classic, Cerro Palenque grew to be the largest city in the valley, with over 500 buildings. 

Settlement patterns shifted in the post-Classic (1150-1536) and Cerro Palenque was abandoned in favor of settlements right down along the river banks.  The valley itself remains an important resource area for the Maya of Yucatan and Belize for chocolate, feathers, and honey.

== Conservation and development ==
The Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (IHAH) obtained 1.09&amp;nbsp;km² of land in 1997 to create an archaeological park.  The intent of the park is to develop tourism infrastructure as well as benefit rural Honduran communities around the settlement.  In 2005 the IHAH contracted with an outside firm to develop a management plan for Cerro Palenque. The consultants wrote an unrealistic plan that called for a 10 year development program with a cost of more than $6,000,000. A link to that plan, in Spanish, is included in the references below (see "Plan de Manejo").

In 2007 the IHAH proposed a project that would develop a visitor's center and interpretive panels for Cerro Palenque, and is in the process of seeking funds to develop this park. The 2009 coup in Honduras stopped these efforts.

'''Chariot burials''' are [[tomb]]s in which the deceased was buried together with their [[chariot]], usually including their [[horse]]s and other possessions. An instance of a person being buried with their horse (without the chariot) is called [[horse burial]].

==Finds==
Novokorsunskaya [[kurgan]] in the [[Kuban]] region of Russia contains a wagon grave of the [[Maykop culture]] (which also had horses). The two solid wooden wheels from this kurgan have been dated to the second half of the [[4th millennium BC|fourth millennium]]. Soon thereafter the number of such burials in this [[Northern Caucasus]] region multiplied.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Baumer, [http://www.asianreviewofbooks.com/pages/?ID=1478 ''The History of Central Asia: The Age of the Steppe Warriors''.] I.B.Tauris, 2012 {{ISBN|1780760604}} p90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Fowler, Jan Harding, Daniela Hofmann, eds, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=2PAkBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 ''The Oxford Handbook of Neolithic Europe.''] OUP Oxford, 2015 {{ISBN|0191666882}} p113&lt;/ref&gt;

Three war chariot burials&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/asi-unearths-firstever-physical-evidence-of-copperbronze-age-chariots-by-manish-sain/1322979|title=ASI unearths 'first-ever' physical evidence of Copper-Bronze age chariots By Manish Sain|work=outlookindia.com/|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; from around 2000 BC depicted as two wheeled open-vehicles on a fixed axle to carry one person along with three coffins, daggers, combs and antenna swords were excavated at [[Sinauli]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] state in [[India]].

The earliest true chariots known are from around 2,000 BC, in burials of the [[Sintashta-Petrovka]] culture in modern [[Russia]] in a cluster along the upper [[Tobol]] river, southeast of [[Magnitogorsk]]. They contained spoke-wheeled chariots drawn by teams of two horses. The culture is at least partially derived from the earlier [[Yamna culture]], where some wagon-burials are found, and is interpreted by certain scholars to have [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] features. The [[Krivoye Lake|Krivoye Ozero]] chariot grave contained a horse skull, three pots, two bridle cheek pieces, and points of spears and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Anthony, ''The Horse, The Wheel and Language: How bronze age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world'' (2007), pp. 397-405.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]] burials are  found in [[China]]. The most noted of these was discovered in 1933 at Hougang, Anyang in central China's [[Henan]] Province, dating from the rule of King [[Wu Ding]] of the [[Yin Dynasty]] (c. 1,200 BC). A [[Western Zhou]] (9th century BC) chariot burial was unearthed at Zhangjiapo, [[Chang'an]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://english.people.com.cn/200203/16/eng20020316_92214.shtml|title= Excavation of Zhou Dynasty Chariot Tombs Reveals More About Ancient Chinese Society|publisher=People’s Daily Online|date= March 16, 2002|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, chariot burials are known from [[Iron Age]] (8th century BC) [[Salamis, Cyprus]], Tomba Regolini Galassi in [[Etruria]] (7th century BC), Italy, and from Beilngries (7th century BC), the [[Hallstatt C]] culture in Germany. Chariot burial was an Iron Age [[Celts|Celtic]] custom; while the wooden chariot has decayed, the [[horse harness]], usually in bronze, survives well, and enough is left of the iron wheel covers and other iron parts to enable well-informed reconstructions. Only the richest were buried in this way, and there are often many other grave-goods. The 4th-century [[Waldalgesheim chariot burial]] is one of the best known.  A tomb from the 4th century BC was discovered in [[Somme-Tourbe|La Gorge-Meillet]], [[Marne]] in France;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-archeologienationale.fr/homes/home_id20392_u1l2.htm Le Musée des Antiquités nationales: Les Âges du fer: La tombe à char de « La Gorge-Meillet »] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111190535/http://www.musee-archeologienationale.fr/homes/home_id20392_u1l2.htm |date=January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; another (450-300) at [[Somme-Bionne]].

In addition to the Etruscan tomb in Italy, there are two chariot burials at [[Sesto Calende]], south of [[Lake Maggiore]], of the [[Golasecca culture]] dating to the 7th and 6th century BC accompanied by weapons, ornaments and a large [[situla (vessel)|situla]] &lt;ref&gt;The Princely Tombs of [[Sesto Calende]]. {{cite web |url=http://www.comune.sesto-calende.va.it/tur_cult/museoweb/english/1ferro_c/principesche/principesche.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719192500/http://www.comune.sesto-calende.va.it/tur_cult/museoweb/english/1ferro_c/principesche/principesche.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while an earlier burial of the same culture, at Ca' Morta - [[Como]] (c. 700 BC), included a four-wheeled wagon in the tomb.

In England, chariot burials are characteristic of, and almost confined to, the Iron Age [[Arras culture]] associated with the [[Parisii (Yorkshire)|Parisii]] tribe. Finds of such burials are rare, and the persons interred were presumably chieftains or other wealthy notables. The [[Wetwang Slack]] chariot burial of c. 300 BC is unusual in that a woman was interred with the chariot.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/the_wetwang_chariot_burial/the_wetwang_chariot_burial.aspx British Museum: The Wetwang Chariot Burial]&lt;/ref&gt; Some 21 British sites are known, spanning approximately four centuries, virtually all in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkshirehistory.com/chariot_burials/ Yorkshire History: Iron Age Chariot Burials]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ferrybridge and [[Newbridge chariot|Newbridge]] (near [[Edinburgh]]) chariots are unusual in Britain as they are the only ones to be buried intact.&lt;ref name="newbridge"&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba76/feat3.shtml British Archaeology 76, May 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The burial custom seems to have disappeared after the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation of [[Roman Britain|Britain]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3400">'''Christos Kapralos''' (Greek: Χρήστος Καπράλος, 1909 - 1993)  was a [[Greece|Greek]] artist of the 20th century.  He was born in [[Panaitolio]] (or Moustafouli) in the former municipality of [[Thesties]], near [[Agrinio]].

He studied drawing at a school with the help of the Agrinian [[Papastratou Brothers|Papastratou Bros.]] and continued studied drawing in [[Paris]] at the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]] and at [[Académie Colarossi]], he had a student named [[Oumbertos Argyros]], his professor was [[Marcel Gimond]].  He returned to [[Greece]] and [[Panaitolio]] in 1945 and in 1946, he moved to [[Athens]] and later to [[Aigina]].

Christos Kapralos in that connection with the bas-relief for the memory of the [[Battle of Pindus]] during [[World War II]], on which he worked between 1940 and 1945 stuck in his village. After the end of the war, march along with the [[Epic poetry|rhapsody]] of history of modern Hellenism.

In May 1964 in Zygos gallery, [[A. Tasos]] he presented his large black and white wooden arts with the mind from the [[Greek Civil War]], one memory for all lost friends of his younger days.  From his works forgets the civil war which was set in 1961 and completed his works "The men".

His works were intensely anthropocentrical with the inspiration of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] art and [[Greek mythology|mythology]].  His works were presented with many expositions not only in Greece, but also in the rest of the world.  In [[Agrinio]] in 1996, functioned the only sculpture exposition in the ''[[Kapralos Art Screen]]'' which is founded in the wall of the [[Papastrateias Public Library]].  His works which includes 60 small works with great length, he loved art from the beginning of his career from 1930 until 1956.  Between those works separate the work Figoura 1951, ''Melpomene'' (1940-1945), [[Kazuo Kikuchi]], a Japanese student from Paris (1937) and ''Christopher'' (1940-1945).

[[Bronze]] and [[marble]] works which he displayed in [[Athens]] from 1960 until 1993 in the front of the building, it lets in Athens in the factory at 7 [[Tripou Street]] in [[Koukaki]].

In the island of [[Aegina|Aigina]] which Kapralos often visited in the summer months, the [[Christos Kapralos Museum]] was founded in his honor. There are six workshops in the museum, that contain all the works which were displayed in Aigina every summer from 1963 until 1993.

Civil rights include the ensuring of peoples' physical and mental [[integrity]], [[right to life|life]], and [[safety]]; protection from discrimination on grounds such as [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[national origin]], [[human skin color|color]], [[ageing|age]], [[Political party|political affiliation]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], and [[disability]];&lt;ref&gt;The Civil Rights act of 1964, [http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=97 ourdocuments.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, [http://www.access-board.gov/about/laws/ada.htm accessboard.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summary of LGBT civil rights protections, by state, at Lambda Legal, [http://www.lambdalegal.org/states-regions/ lambdalegal.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[individual rights]] such as [[privacy]] and the freedoms of [[freedom of thought|thought]], [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of the press|press]], [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], and [[freedom of movement|movement]].

Political rights include [[natural justice]] (procedural fairness) in [[law]], such as the [[rights of the accused]], including the [[right to a fair trial]]; [[due process]]; the right to seek redress or a [[legal remedy]]; and rights of [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] in [[civil society]] and [[politics]] such as [[freedom of association]], the [[right to assemble]], the [[right to petition]], the [[right of self-defense]], and the [[Suffrage|right to vote]].

Civil and political rights form the original and main part of international [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;A useful survey is Paul Sieghart, ''The Lawful Rights of Mankind: An Introduction to the International Legal Code of Human Rights'', Oxford University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; They comprise the first portion of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (with [[economic, social, and cultural rights]] comprising the second portion). The theory of [[three generations  of human rights]] considers this group of rights to be "first-generation rights", and the theory of [[negative and positive rights]] considers them to be generally [[negative rights]].

==History==
The phrase "Rights for Civil" is a translation of Latin ''ius civis'' (rights of a citizen). Roman citizens could be either free (''libertas'') or servile (''servitus''), but they all had rights in law.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, T. Lambert, ''Analysis of M. Ortolan's Institutes of Justinian, Including the History and'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, these rights included the freedom of religion; however in 380, the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] required all subjects of the Roman Empire to profess Catholic Christianity.&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch"&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin and Geoffrey William Bromiley, ''The encyclopedia of Christianity'', Volume 4, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman legal doctrine was lost during the Middle Ages, but claims of universal rights could still be made based on Christian doctrine. According to the leaders of [[Kett's Rebellion]] (1549), "all bond men may be made free, for God made all free with his precious blood-shedding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/humanrights/1500-1760/ |title=Human Rights: 1500-1760 - Background |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[English common law]] judge Sir [[Edward Coke]] revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed [[Rights of Englishmen|such rights]]. The [[Parliament of England]] adopted the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1689. It was one of the influences drawn on by [[George Mason]] and [[James Madison]] when drafting the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] in 1776. The Virginia declaration is the direct ancestor and model for the [[U.S. Bill of Rights]] (1789).

The removal by legislation of a civil right constitutes a "civil disability". In early 19th century Britain, the phrase "civil rights" most commonly referred to the issue of such legal discrimination against Catholics. In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] support for civil rights was divided, with many  politicians agreeing with the existing civil disabilities of Catholics. The [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] restored their civil rights.

In the 1860s, Americans adapted this usage to newly freed blacks. [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted [[Civil Rights Act (disambiguation)|civil rights acts]] in [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|1866]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|1871]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1875|1875]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1957|1957]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1960|1960]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|1968]], and [[Civil Rights Act of 1991|1991]].

==Protection of rights==
[[T. H. Marshall]] notes that civil rights were among the first to be recognized and codified, followed later by political rights and still later by social rights. In many countries, they are [[constitutional right]]s and are included in a [[bill of rights]] or similar document. They are also defined in [[international human rights instruments]], such as the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the 1967 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].

Civil and political rights need not be codified to be protected, although most [[Democracy|democracies]] worldwide do have formal written guarantees of civil and political rights. Civil rights are considered to be [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote in his ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]'' that "a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their [[chief magistrate]]."

The question of to whom civil and political rights apply is a subject of controversy. In many countries, [[citizen]]s have greater protections against infringement of rights than non-citizens; at the same time, civil and political rights are generally considered to be universal rights that apply to all [[person]]s.

According to political scientist Salvador Santino F. Regilme Jr., analyzing the causes of and lack of protection from human rights abuses in the Global South should be focusing on the interactions of domestic and international factors—an important perspective that has usually been systematically neglected in the social science literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Regilme |first=Salvador Santino F., Jr. |date=3 October 2014 |title=The Social Science of Human Rights: The Need for a 'Second Image Reversed'? |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01436597.2014.946255 |work=[[Third World Quarterly]] |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1390–1405 |doi=10.1080/01436597.2014.946255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other rights==
[[Custom (law)|Custom]] also plays a role. Implied or [[unenumerated rights]] are rights that [[court]]s may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom; one example is the [[right to privacy]] in the [[United States]], and the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] explicitly shows that there are other rights that are also protected.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] states that people have unalienable rights including "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness". It is considered by some that the sole purpose of government is the protection of life, liberty and property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb4.htm House Bill 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001010710/http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb4.htm |date=2012-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social movements for civil rights==
{{Main article|Movements for civil rights}}

[[File:Savka Dabcevic Kucar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Savka Dabčević-Kučar]], [[Croatian Spring]] participant; Europe's first female prime minister]]

Civil rights guarantee equal protection under the law. When civil and political rights are not guaranteed to all as part of equal protection of [[law]]s, or when such guarantees exist on paper but are not respected in practice, opposition, legal action and even [[social unrest]] may ensue.

Some historians suggest that [[New Orleans]] was the cradle of the civil rights movement in the United States, due to the earliest efforts of Creoles to integrate the military ''en masse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Fernin|title=Louisiana's Free People of Color-Digitization Grant-letter in support|url=https://www.academia.edu/3505760/Louisianas_Free_People_of_Color-Digitization_grant_awarded_to_LSU_Hill_library_others|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; W.C.C. Claiborne, appointed by Thomas Jefferson to be governor of the Territory of Orleans, formally accepted delivery of the French colony on December 20, 1803. Free men of colour had been members of the militia for decades under both Spanish and French control of the colony of Louisiana. They volunteered their services and pledged their loyalty to Claiborne and to their newly adopted country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Clarence|title=The Territorial Papers of the United States, Vol. IX, The Territory of Orleans|year=1940|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, in early 1804, the new U.S. administration in New Orleans, under Governor Claiborne, was faced with a dilemma previously unknown in the United States, i.e., the integration of the military by incorporating entire units of previously established "colored" militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Fernin|title=1811 Slave Uprising, etc|url=https://www.academia.edu/1910804/Gov._Claiborne_in_his_own_words--a_salon_publique_at_Pitot_House_Bayou_St._John|work=Salon Publique, Pitot House, November 7, 2011|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; See, e.g., the February 20, 1804 letter to Claiborne from Secretary of War Henry Dearborn that "it would be prudent not to increase the Corps, but to diminish, if it could be done without giving offense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Dunbar|title=Official Letter Books of W.C.C. Claiborne, 1801-1816|year=1917|publisher=Mississippi Dept. of Archives &amp; History|volume=2|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil rights movements in the United States gathered steam by 1848 with such documents as the Declaration of Sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;"Signatures to the Seneca Falls Convention 'Declaration of Sentiments{{'"}}. American History Online, Facts On File, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2014}} Consciously modeled after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[Declaration of Rights and Sentiments]] became the founding document of the American women's movement, and it was adopted at the Seneca Falls Convention, July 19 and 20, 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen-DuPont, Kathryn.

Worldwide, several [[political movement]]s for [[equality before the law]] occurred between approximately 1950 and 1980. These movements had a legal and constitutional aspect, and resulted in much law-making at both national and international levels. They also had an activist side, particularly in situations where violations of rights were widespread. Movements with the proclaimed aim of securing observance of civil and political rights included:

* the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States, where rights of black citizens had been violated;
* the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]], formed in 1967 following failures in this province of the [[United Kingdom]] to respect the Roman Catholic minority's rights; and
* movements in many Communist countries, such as the [[Prague Spring]] and [[Charter 77]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] and the uprisings in Hungary.

Most civil rights movements relied on the technique of [[civil resistance]], using [[nonviolent]] methods to achieve their aims.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009. Includes chapters by specialists on the various movements.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, struggles for civil rights were accompanied, or followed, by [[civil unrest]] and even armed rebellion. While civil rights movements over the last sixty years have resulted in an extension of civil and political rights, the process was long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.

==Problems and analysis==
Questions about civil and political rights have frequently emerged. For example, to what extent should the government intervene to protect individuals from infringement on their rights by other [[individual]]s, or from [[corporation]]s—e.g., in what way should [[employment discrimination]] in the [[private sector]] be dealt with?

[[Political theory]] deals with civil and political rights. [[Robert Nozick]] and [[John Rawls]] expressed competing visions in Nozick's ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' and Rawls' ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''. Other influential authors in the area include [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld]], and [[Jean Edward Smith]].

==First-generation rights==
First-generation rights, often called "purple" rights, deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally civil and political in nature, as well as strongly [[individual and group rights|individualistic]]: They serve [[negative and positive rights|negatively to protect]] the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, [[freedom of speech]], the [[right to a fair trial]], (in some countries) the [[right to keep and bear arms]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[voting rights]]. They were pioneered in the [[United States]] by the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and in [[France]] by the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in the 18th century, although some of these rights and the right to due process date back to the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 and the [[Rights of Englishmen]], which were expressed in the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1689.

They were enshrined at the global level and given status in [[international law]] first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and later in the 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In Europe, they were enshrined in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1953.

The civil rights movement was a struggle for social justice that took place mainly during the 1950s and 1960s for blacks to gain equal rights under the law in the United States. In 1868, the  14th amendment to the constitution gave blacks equal protection under the law.
In the 1960s, Americans who knew only the potential of "equal protection of the laws" expected the president, the Congress, and the courts to fulfill the promise of the 14th Amendment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1828">'''East Community''' is an [[Ancestral Puebloans|Ancestral Puebloan]] [[Great house (pueblo)|great house]] community and archeological site located {{convert|12|miles}} east of [[Pueblo Bonito]], at the eastern end of [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park]], New Mexico. Archeological evidence uncovered during the 1980s suggests the site was occupied by both Chacoans and [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verdeans]]. Eighty-two structures have been identified in the area, including a great house that contains twenty-five rooms and several [[Small house (pueblo)|small house sites]]. At least one [[kiva]] has been uncovered there, but no great kivas. A partial road segment is visible there, but archeologists are unsure of it connects with a longer segment thought to originate near [[Pueblo Pintado]]. The great house at East Community was constructed in the 10th century, with significant additions completed during the 11th century. The associated small house sites were occupied by Chacoans from 875 to 1300, and thirty-nine of them by Mesa Verdeans, from 1175 to 1300. Archeologist Thomas Windes believes the site was linked to Chaco Canyon through a system of signaling stations atop the area's mesas.{{sfn|Vivian|Hilpert|2012|pp=120–21}}

This article gives an overview of '''[[Esotericism|esoteric movements]] in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]''' between 1880 and 1945, presenting [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]] and [[Ariosophy]], among others, against the influences of earlier European esotericism.

==Influences from before 1880==

===Knights Templar and occultism===
The original [[Knights Templar]], founded around 1119, had been a crusading military order, that, at some time, had established financial networks across the whole of Christendom. In 1307, King [[Philip IV of France]] mounted a "slanderous campaign"&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 60&lt;/ref&gt; to strip the Order of its economic and political influence. The Templars were accused of Satanic practices, perversions and blasphemy and ruthlessly suppressed; Its leaders were burned on March 18, 1314. The circumstances of their suppression gave rise to [[Knights Templar legends|legends surrounding the Knights Templar]]. In Germany, "where the growth of deviant Masonic rites was greatest,"&lt;ref name=G-C61&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 61&lt;/ref&gt; the Templar heritage was adopted for irregular Freemasonry. ([[Freemasonry]] had been officially founded in England in 1717.)

The idea of chivalric Freemasonry first occurred ca. 1737 in France.&lt;ref name=G-C61&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1775 Baron Gotthelf von Hund (1722–76) founded the [[Rite of Strict Observance|Order of Strict Observance]], claiming the possession of secret Templar documents which allegedly prove that his order represented the legal Templar succession.&lt;ref name=G-C61&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosicrucianism===
In the 17th century and 18th century, [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian ideas]] flourished in varying degrees. Rosicrucianism goes back to the beginning of the 17th century, when three works by [[Johannes Valentinus Andreae|Johann Valentin Andreae]] were printed at [[Kassel]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 58, 59&lt;/ref&gt; One of these works, the ''[[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz|Chymische Hochzeit]]'', appears to be an [[Alchemy|alchemical]] tract, while the other two (for which the authorship of Valentin Andreae is not finally proven) announce the existence of the ''Rosicrucian Order'', which desires an "universal and general reformation of the whole world". Putatively this order was founded by Christian Rosenkreutz, who is supposed to have lived from 1378 to 1484.

In either 1747 or 1757 a quasi-masonic Rosicrucian order of the name ''Gold- und Rosenkreuz'' was founded in Berlin, having a 9-grade hierarchy based on the [[Kabbalah|cabalistic]] [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]; This organisation included King [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] and [[Johann Christoph von Wöllner]]&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Johann Christoph von Wöllner|Johann Christoph von Wöllner]]&lt;/ref&gt; as members.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 59"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==German occult revival, 1880–1910==

{{quote|The modern German occult revival owes its inception to the popularity of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] in the Anglo-Saxon world during the 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Theosophy===
The first German Theosophical Society was established in July 1884, under the presidency of [[Wilhelm Hübbe-Schleiden]],&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Wilhelm von Hübbe-Schleiden]]&lt;/ref&gt; a conservative German nationalist turned spiritual seeker who sought to establish Theosophy on a "scientific" basis.&lt;ref name=Treitel&gt;Corinna Treitel, ''A Science for the Soul'', {{ISBN|0-8018-7812-8}}, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1886 and 1895 Hübbe-Schleiden published the monthly periodical ''Die Sphinx''.&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Sphinx (Zeitschrift)|Sphinx magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austheos.org.au/indices/SPHINXHU.HTM  Table of contents to the Sphinx magazine&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vienna]], a theosophical society was founded in 1887, its president was [[Friedrich Eckstein]].&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Friedrich Eckstein]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 28"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his circle at this time [[Franz Hartmann]], a leader of theosophical work who emphasized personal spiritual experience,&lt;ref name= Treitel/&gt; and the young [[Rudolf Steiner]] were members.&lt;ref name = "Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 28"/&gt;  A ''German Theosophical Society'', as a branch of the ''International Theosophical Brotherhood'', then was established in 1896 when the American theosophists around [[William Quan Judge]], [[Katherine Tingley]], ''E. T. Hargrove'' and ''C. F. Wright'' travelled through Europe.&lt;ref name = "GC25-6"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 25, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Its president was Franz Hartmann, who also founded a theosophical lay-monastery at [[Ascona]] in 1889.&lt;ref name = "GC24-5"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 24, 25&lt;/ref&gt;  His periodical [[Lotusblüten (magazine)|Lotusblüten]] (''Lotus Blossoms'', 1892–1900) was the first German publication to use the theosophical [[swastika]] on its cover.&lt;ref name= "GC25-6" /&gt;

Hartmann's example provided the impetus for [[Paul Zillmann]] to found the ''Metaphysische Rundschau'' (''Metaphysical Review'') in 1896.&lt;ref name= "GC25-6" /&gt;

[[Image:Lucifer-gnosis-1904.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Cover of the June 1904 edition of Lucifer-Gnosis]]

[[Rudolf Steiner]] was made general secretary of the ''German Theosophical Society'' in 1902.&lt;ref name= "GC25-6" /&gt;  Steiner, who was seeking to develop an [[esoteric]] path suitable for the modern era, and professed commitment to [[scientific method]]ology, was yet oriented towards awakening spiritual experiences in each individual rather than depending upon authorities or [[guru]]s.&lt;ref name=Treitel/&gt; He published ''Luzifer'' at Berlin from 1903 to 1908.

In Vienna, there also existed an ''Association for Occultism'', connected to a person called ''Philipp Maschlufsky''.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 28"/&gt; From 1903 he published a periodical called ''Die Gnosis'', that was later absorbed by ''Rudolf Steiner's'' periodical ''Luzifer'', and renamed ''Lucifer-Gnosis''.&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Lucifer-Gnosis]]&lt;/ref&gt;

"It may have been a desire to counter Steiner's influence in the occult subculture which led Hartmann to encourage the publication of several new periodicals."&lt;ref name= "Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 27"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 27&lt;/ref&gt;  A Theosophical Publishing House was established by ''Hugo Vollrath'' in [[Leipzig]] in 1906. Among the magazines published there was ''Prana'' (1909–19), initially edited by ''Karl Brandler-Pracht'' and later edited by [[Johannes Balzli]]. Before that, a publisher with the name Wilhelm Friedrich had already published the works of Hartmann and Hübbe-Schleiden, as well as translations of the English theosophists at Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 27, 51, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm Friedrich had also published the occult works of Max Ferdinand Sebaldt von Werth (1859–1916). Initially, this author had collaborated with Moritz von Egidy&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Moritz von Egidy|Moritz von Egidy]]&lt;/ref&gt; on the periodical ''Das angewande Christentum'' (''Applied Christianity''), but later he wrote volumes on "the sexual-religion of the Aryans", thus, in the opinion of Goodrick-Clarke, anticipating Ariososophy.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthroposophy===
From 1907 (at latest), tensions between [[Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society]] grew steadily.  In 1912, Rudolf Steiner broke away to found [[anthroposophy]].  There were two causes of the break; Steiner's [[Europe]]an and [[Christian]] orientation had long been distinct from the [[Hinduism|hinduistic]] interest of the theosophists under the leadership of [[Annie Besant]].&lt;ref name= "GC25-6" /&gt; More immediately, Steiner publicly distanced himself from Besant's promotion of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as a supposed new [[messiah]]. Steiner and a group of prominent German theosophists officially founded the [[Anthroposophical Society]] in December 1913, the vast majority of the German membership of the Theosophical Society following them into the new group; the breakaways were excluded from the Theosophical Society in January 1914.

===Guido von List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels===
{{Further|Ariosophy}}
Living in Vienna, [[Guido von List|Guido (von) List]] (1848–1919) had been active as journalist and writer. After he turned to esotericism, he became the first popular author to combine [[völkisch]] ideology and occultism into the type of esoteric doctrine that is now collectively labelled [[Ariosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1903 the occult periodical ''Die Gnosis'' (see above) included an article by List, in which he, referring Sebaldt von Werth, started to articulate "a Germanic occult religion".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 41, 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decade, List continued to work on this topic, also making references to the works of [[Madame Blavatsky]] and [[William Scott-Elliot]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In his concept of Armanism, the religion of the theocratic elite in his image of the ancient Germanic past, List borrowed material from Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Since his manuscript, proposing the research into the runes by the "means of occult insight", was rejected from the Imperial Academie of Sciences in Vienna, the supporters of List formed  a List Society (''Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft'') to finance his research. The Society was founded officially on 2 March 1908. Its members included völkisch authors as well as occultists (for example Franz Hartmann and the complete membership of the Vienna Theosophical Society). Some inner members of the List Society participated in the activities of the ''Hoher Armanen-Orden'' (''High Armanen-Order'').&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This order, however, achieved no significance as a lodge-like organisation.

[[Lanz von Liebenfels|Jörg Lanz (von Liebenfels)]] (1874–1954) had been a [[Cistercians|cistercian monk]] between 1893 and 1899. In 1903 he published a long article "Anthropozoon biblicum" in the ''Vierteljahrsschrift für Bibelkunde'', a periodical for biblical research.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 93, 275&lt;/ref&gt; By 1905 his studies in this direction had cumulated into the book ''Theozoologie'', a "strange amalgam" of traditional Judaeo-Christian sources and contemporary life-sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 94&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, Lanz proposed a "frequently obscene and always radical" interpretation of the Bible, according to which it had been the purpose of the [[Old Testament]] to warn the [[Aryan race]] against interbreeding with [[Pygmies]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 94, 96&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 Lanz also established his own magazine, [[Ostara (magazine)|Ostara]]. One of the few other contributors to this magazine beside Lanz himself was the theosophist Harald Grävell von Jostenoode (1856–1932), who also edited one number of [[Lotusblüten (magazine)|Lotusblüten]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrology===
Among the theosophists, [[astrology]] enjoyed a revival.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 84, 103&lt;/ref&gt; Astrological texts by Karl Brandler-Pracht, Otto Pöllner, Ernst Tiede, and Albert Knief appeared at the Theosophical Publishing House at [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 103&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karl Brandler-Pracht'' had also founded the ''First Viennese Astrological Society'' in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Jan Hanussen]], who later would become the most famous [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] in Germany and Austria, gave his first occult session with ''E.&amp;nbsp;K. Hermann'' in Vienna in 1911.&lt;ref name="TP-Hanussen"&gt;Markus Kompa (with the collaboration of Wilfried Kugel): [http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/27/27562/1.html Erik Jan Hanussen - Hokus-Pokus-Tausendsassa]; {{de icon}} [[Telepolis]], 24 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other developments===
The German and Vienna occult subculture was well developed before the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 27"/&gt; Aside from the developments mentioned above, there are some more of interest:

"The [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO) originated in the irregular masonic activities of [[Theodor Reuss]], [[Franz Hartmann]], and [[Carl Kellner (mystic)|Karl Kellner]] between 1895 and 1906."&lt;ref name="G-C61"/&gt; Theodor Reuss had been in contact with [[William Wynn Westcott|William Wescott]], a founding member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 59"/&gt;

[[Ernst Wachler (author)|Ernst Wachler]] was a völkisch author (he supported the ''Guido von List Society'') who had founded an open-air Germanic theatre in the [[Harz]] mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 43&lt;/ref&gt; This theatre, called ''Green Stage'' (''Grüne Bühne''), was closed in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Bergtheater Thale|Bergtheater Thale]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germanische Glaubens-Gemeinschaft]], founded in 1907, is claimed by current [[Germanic Neopaganism]] groups as predecessor. It was founded and led by the painter [[Ludwig Fahrenkrog]]. Since 1908, the group used the [[swastika]] as its symbol. After 1938 the use of the swastika became prohibited and the group was no longer allowed to hold public meetings. However, unlike many other esoteric groups in Nazi Germany, the GGG was not forced to disband, partly "because of Fahrenkrog's international status as an artist."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Wolff, "Ludwig Fahrenkrog and the Germanic Faith Community: Wodan Triumphant" in [[Tyr (journal)|Tyr: Myth—Culture—Tradition]], Ultra 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interbellum (Weimar Republic)==

===Ariosophy, ''Ordo Novi Templi'', and Lumenclub===
Lanz had coined the term [[ariosophy]], meaning occult wisdom concerning the Aryans, in 1915. In the 1920s he then used this label for his doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 1926 he published: ''Das Buch der Psalmen teutsch: das Gebetbuch der Ariosophen, Rassenmystiker, und Antisemiten''. (''The book of psalms, German: The book of prayer of the Ariosophists, Race mystics, and Antisemites'') This is the only book of Lanz von Liebenfels that was later found in [[Hitler]]'s personal library. (Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 198, 275)&lt;/ref&gt; Both List and Lanz greeted [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] as a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 86 (List), 103 (Lanz)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guido von List]] wrote his research reports on the "Aryo-Germanics" (Ario-Germanen) between 1908 and 1913, but in 1917 two later articles written by him appeared in ''Prana''. He died 1919 in Berlin. The List Society was continued after his death, but not much is known of its activities.
By contrast, an organisation founded around 1907&lt;ref&gt;Lanz von Liebenfels has claimed that the founding of the ONT occurred on [[Christmas]] Day 1900, but Goodrick-Clarke does not consider this statement reliable. Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 245.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Lanz von Liebenfels]] achieved more significance: the "new Templar lodge", called ''Ordo Novi Templi'' (ONT) (German: [[:de:Neutempler-Orden|Neutempler-Orden]]).

On 11 November 1932, influenced by Ariosophy, an industrialist with the name Johann Walthari Wölfl also founded an association called the Lumenclub in Vienna, which overlapped in membership with the ONT.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 118, 119&lt;/ref&gt; The ideological sympathy of the Lumenclub to [[Nazism]] is beyond question, as it acted as growth centre for the Nazi party that was illegal in Austria since 1934.&lt;ref name=GC119&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 119&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they were later suppressed like other esoteric groups. After the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in 1938, Lanz von Liebenfels had his writings banned.&lt;ref name="Bramwell 1985: 42"&gt;Bramwell 1985: 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lumenclub and the ONT were suppressed by the [[Gestapo]] in March 1942, following the party edict of December 1938 that applied to many sectarian groups.&lt;ref name=GC119/&gt;

''Werner von Bülow'' and ''Herbert Reichstein'' had applauded the advent of the third reich in their esoteric magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 192&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rune occultism====
Influenced by Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels (see: [[Ariosophy]]), a new "Aryan occultist movement"&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 155&lt;/ref&gt; was started after 1918 in Germany by [[Rudolf John Gorsleben]].

Since the esoteric importance of the runes (that first had been developed by [[Guido von List]], see [[Armanen runes]]) was central to his world-view,&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 157&lt;/ref&gt; Goodrick-Clarke speaks in this context of "rune occultism".

Here two authors stand out, as they engaged the runes in "a less explicitly [[Aryan race|Aryan racist]] context". [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby]] and [[Siegfried Adolf Kummer]] focused more on the practical side of rune occultism. In 1936 Friedrich Bernhard Marby was arrested and sent to a [[concentration camp]] (''Flossenbürg'' and later [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]).&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 161&lt;/ref&gt; He survived and resumed his occult research after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 161; Friedrich Bernhard Marby, 1975, ''Sonne und Planeten im Tierkreis'', p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Responsible for his incarceration might have been [[Karl Maria Wiligut]], who was Himmler's counsellor on the occult. (see: [[Nazi occultism]]) Willigut was of the opinion that Marby (and also Kummer) were bringing "the holy [[Aryan]] heritage into disrepute and ridicule".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 161; Weisthor (Willigut) to Himmler, letter dated 2 May 1934, [[Bundesarchiv]], ''Koblenz'', Himmler Nachlass 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiligut also had identified [[Irminism]] as the true ancestral religion, claiming that [[Guido von List]]'s ''Wotanism'' and runic row was a schismatic false religion, but this does seem to be unconnected to the arrest of Marby.

Other measures against esoteric groups were most probably the result of the general Nazi policy of suppressing lodge organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, The Occult Roots of Nazism, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other developments===
In the years following the military defeat, there was a burgeoning occult movement in Germany and Austria. Significant figures in this milieu were [[Gustav Meyring]], [[Franz Spunda]] and [[Peryt Shou]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Esotericism in Nazi Germany==
{{Further|Nazism and occultism||Esoteric Nazism|religious aspects of Nazism|Ariosophy}}

===German Faith Movement===
{{main|German Faith Movement}}
The [[German Faith Movement]] led by [[Jakob Wilhelm Hauer]] during 1933-1945 propagated a move away from Christianity towards an "Aryan-Nordic religion", partly [[Hinduism in the West|inspired by Hinduism]].

===Suppression of Freemasonry and esotericism===
{{further|Friedrich Hielscher}}
The [[suppression of Freemasonry]] in Nazi Germany also reached the level of outright [[persecution]]. It is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were murdered under the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name="holocaust"&gt;Christopher Hodapp. 2005. Freemasons for Dummies, Wiley Publishing Inc., Indianapolis, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; The lodge [[Liberté chérie]] was founded in a concentration camp. Freemasons, who were sent to concentration camps, were sent there as political prisoners, and consequently forced to wear an inverted red triangle. (see: [[Nazi concentration camp badges]])

Within the Nazi ideology it was alleged that Freemasonry was part of "the Jewish conspiracy". Since many esoteric groups emulated the lodge structure of Freemasonry, they were "caught in the National Socialist anti-Masonic law of 1935".&lt;ref name=Bramwell50&gt;Bramwell 1985: 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Even "the German Order of Druids" was closed down, "protesting to the last that they were not Freemasons but good, German Druids."&lt;ref name=Bramwell50&gt;Bramwell 1985: 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In her biography of [[Richard Walther Darré]], the historian Anna Bramwell also remarks that a secret society called the Skald Order "was banned by the Nazis after 1933 because of its allegedly masonic nature."&lt;ref&gt;Bramwell 1985: 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the Skald held office in the Third Reich, including Dr [[Ludolf Haase]] (a founder member of the Skald), [[Herbert Backe]] and [[Theo Gross]]; all came under covert investigation, though Backe is said to have been cleared of disloyalty by Heydrich from his deathbed.&lt;ref&gt;Bramwell 1985: 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the Nazi ideology had a special view concerning the various esoteric doctrines (aside from confusing them with Freemasonry) is not clear. Concerning [[Anthroposophy]], a book whose title denounced [[Rudolf Steiner]] as a fraud (''Schwindler'') and a false prophet had been published by Gregor Schwartz-Bostunitsch in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Schwartz-Bostunitsch. 1930. ''"Doktor Steiner - ein Schwindler wie keiner"''. Ein Kapital über Anthroposophie und die geistige Arbeit der 'Falschen Propheten'. Munich. See: Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 284 (Bibliography).&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz-Bostunitsch had been an "enthusiastic Anthroposophist" from 1923, but was disaffected by 1929 and later joined the SS.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrology was officially interdicted in Nazi Germany after 1938.&lt;ref name="DLF"&gt;[http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/dasfeature/774541/ Nostradamus und die Nazis] {{de icon}} - A 'Feature' of [[Deutschlandfunk]] (German national radio) that was aired on September 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Nazis had sympathizing astrologers write favourable interpretations of [[Nostradamus]] for [[psychological warfare]],&lt;ref name="DLF"/&gt; and as late as 1936 Hitler personally sent a greetings telegram to an international astrologer's congress that was taking place in [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref name="DLF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://images.google.com/hosted/life/b1ed1d8761e1ae4a.html Telegram from Hitler to Dr. Korsch, President of the International Astrological Congress.] Image obtained by Life magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full focus of the state was not aimed at religious groups until 9 June 1941&lt;ref&gt;Bramwell 1985: 178.&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the head of the security police, banned lodge organizations and esoteric groups in the wake of the flight to Scotland by [[Rudolf Hess]], who had been attracted and influenced by the [[Biodynamic agriculture|organic farming]] theories of [[Rudolf Steiner]] and Anthroposophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 175, 177. When organic farmers and their supporters &amp;mdash; and even [[nudist]]s &amp;mdash; were arrested, Agriculture Minister [[Richard Walther Darré]] protested to Himmler and Heydrich, "despite a letter from [[Martin Bormann|Bormann]], warning Darré that Hitler was behind the arrests" (''ibid.'', 178).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the suppression of esoteric organisations began very soon after the Nazis acquired governmental power. Dr. Anna Bramwell points out that "occultist racialists were banned as early as 1934."&lt;ref name="Bramwell 1985: 42"/&gt;

Allegedly the [[Magic (illusion)|stage magician]] and [[occult]]ist [[Franz Bardon]] had attracted the notice of Adolf Hitler ''"like other workers for the Light"'' and was incarcerated in a concentration camp for three and a half months in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Merkur Publishing: [http://www.merkurpublishing.com/franz_bardon_bio.htm Franz Bardon Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002181045/http://www.merkurpublishing.com/franz_bardon_bio.htm |date=2007-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move away from earlier Nazi esotericism===
The [[Thule Society]] was dissolved still in the 1920s, well before Hitler's rise to power, and the anti-Masonic legislation of 1935 closed down esoteric organisations including ''völkisch'' occultist ones.

[[Karl Maria Wiligut]], the chief occultist influence on the Nazi establishment, retired in 1939. [[Alfred Rosenberg]],  whose 1930 ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century|Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' had been important in the foundation of Nazi racist ideology, and [[Heinrich Himmler]], who added a number of occultist "design elements" to the [[Schutzstaffel]], did remain high ranking party members throughout the war. Himmler's mystic tendencies can be seen in the [[Ahnenerbe]] organization and the [[Wewelsburg]] castle.

According to their private writings,&lt;ref&gt;''Hitler's Table Talk'', page 61, translated by Norman Cameron and R.H. Stevens, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mein Kampf'', chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; the leaders of the [[Nazism|Nazi Party]] in Germany did not wish to encourage forms of paganism which did not serve to further their goals of promoting pan-Germanic ethnic consciousness.

Already in 1927, Hitler had fired the [[Gauleiter]] of [[Thuringia|Thüringen]], [[Artur Dinter]], from his post because he wanted too much to make a religion of Aryan racial purity. In 1928, Dinter was expelled from the party when he publicly attacked Hitler about this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{BBKL|d/dinter_a|band=18|autor=Andreas Schulz and [[Matthias Wolfes]]|artikel=Dinter, Artur|spalten=350-360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf von Sebottendorff]] had been involved in the [[Thule Society]]. In January 1933 he published ''Bevor Hitler kam: Urkundlich aus der Frühzeit der Nationalsozialistischen Bewegung'' (Before Hitler Came: Documents from the Early Days of the National Socialist Movement). Nazi authorities  disliked the book, which was banned in the following year. Sebottendorff was arrested but managed to flee to [[Turkey]].

==After 1945==
Other than popular [[Western astrology]], there is also a school of thought regarding [[Germanic Runic Astrology]] and its usage in divination within the northern tradition of [[Odinism]].

The work of [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby]] was continued by Rudolf Arnold Spieth, who also published one of his works posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Gugenberger: [http://logo.at/artikel.dws?ffitem=435&amp;TEMPLATE=NEWS&amp;TID=DWBCDJAREGLBBQ Friedrich Bernhard Marby] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928123708/http://logo.at/artikel.dws?ffitem=435&amp;TEMPLATE=NEWS&amp;TID=DWBCDJAREGLBBQ |date=2007-09-28 }} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival of [[Neopaganism in German-speaking Europe|Neopaganism in Germany and Austria]] began in the 1970s.
Since the 1980s, mainstream esotericism in German-speaking Europe has been dominated by generic [[New Age]] syncretism as it developed in the [[United States]].

In [[literary criticism]], the term '''fabulation''' was popularized by [[Robert Scholes]], in his work ''The Fabulators'', to describe the large and growing class of mostly 20th century [[novel]]s that are in a style similar to [[magical realism]], and do not fit into the traditional categories of [[Literary realism|realism]] or (novelistic) [[romance novel|romance]]. They violate, in a variety of ways, standard novelistic expectations by drastic—and sometimes highly successful—experiments with subject matter, form, style, temporal sequence, and fusions of the everyday, fantastic, mythical, and nightmarish, in renderings that blur traditional distinctions between what is serious or trivial, horrible or ludicrous, tragic or comic. To a large extent, fabulism and [[postmodernism]] coincide; [[John Barth]], for example, was labeled a fabulist until the term "postmodernism" was coined{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5790">'''Havidol''' (avafynetyme HCL) is a [[parody]] campaign for a fictional medication to treat a fake [[psychological disorder]] called Dysphoric Social Attention Consumption Deficit Anxiety Disorder (DSACDAD). [Pronounced Dee-sack-dad] The name is a play on the phrase: "have it all"; its pseudo-chemical name, "avafynetyme HCL", reads, "Have a fine time".

==History==
According to the artist, [[Justine Cooper (artist)|Justine Cooper]], the "official HAVIDOL website", havidol.com, had 5,000 hits within a few days of its creation, and some visitors to her gallery have believed HAVIDOL to be a real prescription drug.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters (Fri Feb 16, 2007 2:40PM EST) [https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSL165119520070216?&amp;src=021607_1724_ARTICLE_PROMO_also_on_reuters Fake drug, fake illness -- and people believe it!] last accessed 2007-02-24&lt;/ref&gt;

HAVIDOL was presented at the 18th Consumers International World Congress on The Ethics of Drug Promotion held in [[Sydney, Australia]] October 29 to November 1, 2007.&lt;ref name=CIWC_20071129&gt;{{Cite conference |last1=Ridberg |first1=Ronit |last2=Carbona |first2=Gene |last3=Cooper |first3=Justine |contribution=SESSION 8 (plenary), Media technologies and public campaigning, Panel discussion |title=International World Congress, Holding Corporations to Account, Luna Park, Sydney, October 29 to November 1, 2007| url = http://consint.live.poptech.coop/Templates/Internal.asp?NodeID=97099?NodeID=96053Consumers |publisher=[[Consumers International]] and CHOICE |date=2007-10-31 |contribution-url=http://www.consumersinternational.org/shared_asp_files/GFSR.asp?NodeID=97098 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204002206/http://www.consumersinternational.org/shared_asp_files/GFSR.asp?NodeID=97098 |archive-date=2007-12-04}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justine Cooper==
[[Australia]]n artist Justine Cooper created the marketing campaign as a social [[satire]] on the [[disease mongering|tactics used by the drug industry]] to sell [[prescription drug|prescription medications]]. The pseudo [[advertising]] campaign also examines our collective desire and expectation, that there is always room for improvement, and our doubts as to whether we are ever good enough, or have enough.&lt;ref name=PBS_20071113&gt;{{cite news| last = Wenner| first = Melinda| title = Art Tackles Big Pharma: A Few Creative-types Raise Awareness About Disease-Mongering | publisher = [[Wired Science]] | date = 2007-11-13 | url = https://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/story/81-art_tackles_big_pharma.html| accessdate = 2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC_20071113&gt;{{cite news | last = Palan| first = Simon| title = Spoof drug exposes big pharma's 'disease mongering'| publisher = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]| date = 2007-10-30| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/30/2074586.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper stated she intended the exhibit to be humorous, but subtle. The campaign recreates the entire drug marketing process. It starts from the invention of a new disorder to the branding process of naming the drug, its pill and logo design, and promotional merchandise. The campaign was on display at the [[Daneyal Mahmood Art Gallery]] in [[New York City]] from February 8 to March 17, 2007 and included TV, print and billboard ads along with merchandise and branding material.&lt;ref name=Artinfo_20070226&gt;{{cite news | title = "Havidol" at NY's Daneyal Mahmood| publisher = Artinfo | date = 2007-02-26 | url = http://www.artinfo.com/articles/story/24396/havidol-at-nys-daneyal-mahmood| accessdate = 2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper had the initial idea while waiting for a flight at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. She viewed her first [[direct-to-consumer advertising|direct-to-consumer]] (DTC) pharmaceutical advertisements, promoting drugs for [[allergy|allergies]], [[insomnia]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[erectile dysfunction]], while watching the news on TV. DTC advertising is only allowed in the United States and New Zealand. She received funding from the [[Australia Council for the Arts]], the Greenwall Foundation in New York, and the [[New York State Council on the Arts]].&lt;ref name=PharmExec_20071015&gt;{{cite web| last = Donahue| first = Marylyn (Special Projects Editor)| title = When Branding Is Art| publisher = PharmExec.org| date = 2007-10-15| url = http://pharmexec.findpharma.com/pharmexec/Supplements/When-Branding-Is-Art/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/465558?contextCategoryId=43508| accessdate = 2008-01-06| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110711002949/http://pharmexec.findpharma.com/pharmexec/Supplements/When-Branding-Is-Art/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/465558?contextCategoryId=43508| archivedate = 2011-07-11| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}

'''Jain philosophy''' is the oldest Indian philosophy that separates body (matter) from the soul (consciousness) completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jain philosophy deals with [[reality]], [[cosmology]], [[epistemology]] (study of knowledge) and Vitalism. It attempts to explain the rationale of being and existence, the nature of the Universe and its constituents, the nature of soul's bondage with body and the means to achieve liberation.

Jain texts expound that in every half-cycle of time, twenty-four [[tirthankara]]s grace this part of the Universe to teach the unchanging doctrine of right faith, right knowledge and right conduct.{{sfn|Jansma|Jain|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=59}} Jain philosophy means the teachings of a ''Tirthankara'' which are recorded in [[Jain Agamas|Sacred Jain texts]]. The distinguishing features of Jain philosophy are:-{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* Belief on independent existence of soul and matter.
* Refutation of the idea that a supreme divine creator, owner, preserver or destroyer of the universe exists.
* Potency of [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], eternal universe.
* Accent on relativity and [[Anekantavada|multiple facets of truth]] and
* Morality and ethics based on liberation of soul.

Jainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of soul and personal responsibility for one's decisions; and that self-reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one's liberation.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Ahiṃsā ==
{{Main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}{{further|Vitalism (Jainism)}}
According to the Jain texts, the vitalities or life-principles are ten, namely the five senses, energy, respiration, life-duration, the organ of speech, and the mind. The table below summaries the vitalities, living beings possess in accordance to their senses.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=62–63,196}}

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Senses

|- style="background:#ffe;"
| Ten
| Mind in addition to the above-mentioned nine vitalities
|}

In the animal world, the five-sensed beings without mind have nine life-principles with the addition of the sense of hearing. Those endowed with mind have ten with the addition of the mind.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=34–35}} According to [[Tattvarthasutra]], a major Jain text, "the severance of vitalities out of passion is injury".{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=99}} According to the [[Purushartha Siddhyupaya]], "non-manifestation of passions like attachment is non-injury {{IAST|(ahiṃsā)}}, and manifestation of such passions is injury (hiṃsā)." This is termed as the essence of the Jaina Scriptures.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=35}} [[Jain vegetarianism|Vegetarianism]] and other nonviolent practices and rituals of Jains flow from the principle of ahiṃsā.{{sfn|Dowling|Scarlett|2006|p=226}}

== Fundamentals ==
{{Main|Tattva (Jainism)}}
Jain philosophy postulates that seven ''"tattva"'' (truths or fundamental principles) constitute reality.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=6}} These are:{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=7}}-
#''Jīva''-The [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] substance which is said to have a separate existence from the body that houses it. ''Jīva'' is characterised by cetana (consciousness) and upayoga (knowledge and perception). Though the soul experiences both birth and death, it is neither really destroyed nor created. Decay and origin refer respectively to the disappearing of one state of soul and appearance of another state, these being merely the modes of the soul substance.
#''[[Ajiva|ajīva]]''- the non-soul
#''[[Asrava|āsrava]]'' (influx)- inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]]'' (bondage)- mutual intermingling of the soul and ''karmas''.
#''[[Samvara]]'' (stoppage)- obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Nirjara]]'' (gradual dissociation)- separation or falling off of part of karmic matter from the soul.
#''mokṣha'' (liberation)- complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).

The knowledge of these reals is said to be essential for the liberation of the soul.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== The Path to Liberation ==
{{Main|Ratnatraya}}
According to the Jain philosophy, the world (''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Saṃsāra]]'') is full of ''hiṃsā'' (violence). Therefore, one should direct all his efforts in attainment of ''moksha''. According to the [[Jain text]], [[Tattvartha sutra]]:{{quote|Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct (together) constitute the path to liberation.|Tattvārthasūtra (1–1){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=2}}}}
* Right Faith (''Samyak Darśana'') means belief in substances like soul and non-soul without delusion and misapprehension.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=18}}
* Right Knowledge (''Samyak Jnāna'')- When the nature of reality (substances) is ascertained with the help of the doctrine of manifold points of view (''anekāntavāda''), the knowledge thus obtained (free from doubts, misapprehension, and delusion) is said to be the Right Knowledge.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=29}}
* Right Conduct (''Samyak chāritra'')-The very nature of the soul; devoid of all passions, untainted, unattached to any alien substance is Right conduct. It is achieved by abjuring all sinful activities of the body, the speech, and the mind.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=31}}

== Substances ==
{{Main|Dravya (Jainism)}}
According to Jainas, the world is composed of two different kinds of substances, the ''Jīva'' (conscious) and the ''ajīva'' (unconscious). These are the uncreated existing constituents of the Universe which impart the necessary dynamics to the Universe by interacting with each other. These constituents behave according to the natural laws and their nature without interference from external entities. Dharma or true religion according to Jainism is ''Vatthu sahāvō dhammō'' translated as "the intrinsic nature of a substance is its true [[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]."{{sfn|Dowling|Scarlett|2006|p=225}}

=== Unconscious substance ===
{{Main|Ajiva}}
The five unconscious (''ajīva'') substances are:{{sfn|Sanghvi|2008|p=26}}

* [[Pudgala]] – It is non living (no soul) [[Matter]], which is classified as solid, liquid, gaseous, energy, fine Karmic materials and extra-fine matter or ultimate particles. Paramānu or ultimate particles are the basic building block of matter.  It possesses at all times four qualities, namely, a color (''varna''), a taste (''rasa''), a smell (''gandha''), and a certain kind of palpability (''sparsha'', touch).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=90}} One of the qualities of the Paramānu and Pudgala is that of permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its basic qualities remain the same. According to Jainism, it cannot be created nor destroyed.
* ''Dharma'' – (Medium of [[Motion (physics)|Motion]]) and ''Adharma'' (Medium of Rest) – Also known as Dharmāstikāya and Adharmāstikāya, they are unique to Jain thought depicting the principles of motion and rest. They are said to pervade the entire universe. ''Dharma'' and ''Adharma'' are by themselves not motion or rest but mediate motion and rest in other bodies. Without dharmāstikāya motion is not possible and without adharmāstikāya rest is not possible in the universe.
* Ākāśa: Space – [[Space]] is a substance that accommodates souls, matter, the principle of motion, the principle of rest, and time. It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points. According to Jains, Space is a substance, in the nature of a vacuum but not a pure vacuum. It is an extended continuous vacuum. As pure vacuum it will be non-existent, and non-extended; which will devoid it of even one positive quality. Therefore, Jains propound that Space, which is endowed with infinite extension is a substance in itself.
* Kāla (Time)- In Jainism, time is explained in two different aspects. Firstly as the measure of duration, known in the form of hours, days, and the like. Secondly, as the cause of the continuity of function of things. According to [[Champat Rai Jain]], "Nothing in nature can exist destitute or devoid of function. Function is discharged by the displacement of energy in the case of simple units and things. If there were no Time-substance to help in the performance of the movement of the displacement of energy, things would be doomed to remain in the same condition always." In its first aspect, time is likened to a wheel with twelve spokes divided into descending and ascending halves with six stages, each of immense duration estimated at billions of sagaropama (ocean years).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1969|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conscious substance ===
According to the Jain philosophy, there are infinite independent souls. These are categorised into two—liberated and non-liberated. Infinite knowledge, perception and bliss are the intrinsic qualities of a soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; These qualities are fully enjoyed unhindered by liberated souls, but obscured by ''[[Karma in Jainism|karma]]'' in the case of non-liberated souls resulting in karmic bondage. This bondage further results in a continuous co-habitation of the soul with the body. Thus, an embodied non-liberated soul is found in four realms of existence—heavens, hells, humans and animal world – in a never-ending cycle of births and deaths also known as ''[[samsāra]]''. The soul is in bondage since beginningless time; however, it is possible to achieve liberation through rational perception, rational knowledge and rational conduct. Harry Oldmeadow notes that Jain ontology is both [[Realism (philosophy)|realist]] and [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualist]] metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oldmeadow|2007|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Karma ==
{{Main| Karma in Jainism}}
[[File:Karma AS.jpg|thumb|Karma as [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and reaction: if we sow [[Goodness and value theory|goodness]], we will reap goodness.]]
[[File:Types of Karma.JPG|thumb|Classification of ''karmas'' as mentioned in Jain texts]]
In Jainism, karma is the basic principle within an overarching psycho-cosmology. It not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=100}} Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}}

Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, and pain as evidence for the existence of karma. Jain texts have classified the various types of karma according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds.{{sfn|Kritivijay|1957|p=21}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}} The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates reliance on supposed existence of divine grace or retribution.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=122}} The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}}

==Cosmology==
{{Main|Jain cosmology}}
{{Further|Jainism and non-creationism}}
[[Jain cosmology]] denies the existence of a supreme being responsible for creation and operation of universe. According to [[Jainism]], this ''loka'' or Universe is an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, immutable in nature, beginningless and endless. [[:Category:Jain texts|Jain texts]] describe the shape of the Universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. The Universe according to Jainism is narrow at top and broad at middle and once again becomes narrow at the bottom. [[Mahapurana (Jainism)|{{IAST|Mahāpurāṇa}}]] of Ācārya [[Jinasena]] is famous for his quote:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allday|2001|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}
{{quote|Some foolish men declare that the creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected. If god created the world, where was he before the creation? If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support, where is he now? How could god have made this world without any raw material? If you say that he made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression.}}

===Kalchakra===
[[File:Jain Cosmic Time Cycle.jpg|300px|thumb|Division of time as envisaged by Jains.]]
According to Jainism, time is beginningless and eternal. The Kālacakra, the cosmic wheel of time, rotates ceaselessly.&lt;ref name="Shah1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wheel of time is divided into two half-rotations, Utsarpiṇī or ascending time cycle and Avasarpiṇī, the descending time cycle, occurring continuously after each other. Utsarpiṇī is a period of progressive prosperity and happiness, while Avsarpiṇī is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality. Each of this half time cycle consisting of innumerable period of time (measured in Sagaropama and Palyopama years) is further sub-divided into six ''aras'' or epochs of unequal periods. Currently, the time cycle is in ''avasarpiṇī'' or descending phase with the following epochs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The aras defined in Jain texts are:
*''Suṣama-suṣamā''
*''Suṣamā''
*''Suṣama-duḥṣamā''
*''Duḥṣama-suṣamā''
*''Duḥṣama''
*''Duḥṣama-duḥṣama''
In ''utsarpiṇī'' the order of the aras is reversed. Starting from Duḥṣama- duḥṣamā, it ends with Suṣama-suṣamā and thus this never ending cycle continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these aras progress into the next phase seamlessly without apocalyptic consequences. The increase or decrease in the happiness, life spans and length of people and general moral conduct of the society changes in a phased and graded manner as the time passes. No divine or supernatural beings are credited or responsible with these spontaneous temporal changes, either in a creative or overseeing role, rather human beings and creatures are born under the impulse of their own [[Karma in Jainism|karma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loka===
[[File:Jain universe.JPG|thumb|300px|Structure of Universe according to the Jain scriptures.]]
The early Jains contemplated the nature of the earth and universe and developed a detailed hypothesis on the various aspects of astronomy and cosmology. According to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into 3 parts:&lt;ref name="Shah, Natubhai 1998. p. 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Urdhva Loka'' – the realms of the gods or heavens
* ''Madhya Loka'' – the realms of the humans, animals and plants
* ''Adho Loka'' – the realms of the hellish beings or the infernal regions. The lower world consists of [[Naraka (Jainism)|seven hells]] which is inhabited by Bhavanpati demigods and the hellish beings. Hellish beings reside in hells whose names are Ratna prabha-dharma, Sharkara prabha-vansha, Valuka prabha-megha, Pank prabha-anjana, Dhum prabha-arista, Tamah prabha-maghavi, Mahatamah prabha-maadhavi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Śalākāpuruṣas===
{{Main|Salakapurusa}}
During the each motion of the half-cycle of the wheel of time, 63 Śalākāpuruṣa or 63 illustrious men, consisting of the 24 Tīrthaṅkaras and their contemporaries regularly appear. The Jain universal or legendary history is basically a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious men. They are 24 Tīrthaṅkara, 12 Chakravartī, 9 Baladevas, 9 Vāsudevas and 9 Prativāsudevas.
Besides these there are 9 Narada, 11 Rudras, 24 Kamdeva, 24 Fathers of the Tirthankaras, 24 Mothers of the Tirthankaras and 14 patriarchs (''Kulakara'') who are also important figures in Jain universal history.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}}

==Epistemology==
{{Main|Jain epistemology}}
Jainism made its own unique contribution to this mainstream development of philosophy by occupying itself with the basic [[Epistemology|epistemological]] issues, namely, with those concerning the nature of knowledge, how knowledge is derived, and in what way knowledge can be said to be reliable. Knowledge for the Jains takes place in the soul, which, without the limiting factor of karma, is omniscient. Humans have partial knowledge – the object of knowledge is known partially and the means of knowledge do not operate to their full capacity. According to ''[[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvārthasūtra]]'', the knowledge of the basic Jaina truths can be obtained through:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* ''{{IAST|Pramāṇa}}'' – means or instruments of knowledge which can yield a comprehensive knowledge of an object, and
* ''Naya'' – particular standpoints, yielding partial knowledge.
{{IAST|Pramāṇa are of five kinds:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prasad|2006|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''mati'' or "sensory knowledge",
* ''Sruta'' or "scriptural knowledge",
* ''avadhi'' or "clairvoyance",
* ''manahparyaya'' or "telepathy", and
* ''kevala'' or "omniscience"

The first two are described as being indirect means of knowledge ''({{IAST|parokṣa}})'', with the others furnishing direct knowledge ''({{IAST|pratyakṣa}})'', by which it is meant that the object is known directly by the soul. Jains came out with their doctrines of [[Relativism|relativity]] used for logic and reasoning:
* ''Anekāntavāda'' – the theory of relative pluralism or manifoldness;
* ''Syādvāda'' – the theory of conditioned predication and;
* ''Nayavāda'' – The theory of partial standpoints.

These philosophical concepts have made most important contributions to the ancient [[Indian philosophy]], especially in the areas of scepticism and relativity.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McEvilley|2002|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anekāntavāda===
{{Main|Anekantavada}}
[[File:Aspects of Violence (Himsa).jpg|thumb|350px|Aspects of Violence (Himsa)]]
One of the most important and fundamental doctrines of Jainism is [[Anekantavada|Anēkāntavāda]]. It refers to the principles of [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] and multiplicity of viewpoints, the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pp=123–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kollerjurno"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pages=400–407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains contrast all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with ''andhagajanyāyah'', which can be illustrated through the parable of the "[[blind men and an elephant]]". In this story, each blind man felt a different part of an elephant (trunk, leg, ear, etc.). All the men claimed to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed, due to their limited perspectives.&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=590–591}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. According to the Jains, only the ''[[Kevala Jnana|Kevalis]]''—omniscient beings—can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the doctrine, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]].&lt;ref name="Dundas2002" /&gt;

''Anekāntavāda'' encourages its adherents to consider the views and beliefs of their rivals and opposing parties. Proponents of ''anekāntavāda'' apply this principle to religion and philosophy, reminding themselves that any religion or philosophy—even Jainism—which clings too dogmatically to its own tenets, is committing an error based on its limited point of view.&lt;ref name="Ronald"&gt;{{cite web | last =Huntington | first =Ronald | title =Jainism and Ethics | url =http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| accessdate= 2012-12-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070819191651/http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| archivedate= 19 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of ''anekāntavāda'' also influenced [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] to adopt principles of religious tolerance, {{IAST|''ahiṃsā''}} and ''[[satyagraha]]''.&lt;ref name = "hay"&gt;{{harvnb |Hay |1970 |pp =14–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syādvāda===
{{Main|Syādvāda}}
''[[Syādvāda]]'' is the theory of [[Conditional sentence|conditioned]] [[Predicate (grammar)|predication]], which provides an expression to ''anekānta'' by recommending that the epithet ''Syād'' be prefixed to every phrase or expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chatterjea|2001|pp=77–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Syādvāda'' is not only an extension of ''anekānta'' [[ontology]], but a separate system of logic capable of standing on its own. The Sanskrit etymological root of the term ''syād'' is "perhaps" or "maybe", but in the context of ''syādvāda'', it means "in some ways" or "from a perspective". As reality is complex, no single proposition can express the nature of reality fully. Thus the term ''"syāt"'' should be prefixed before each proposition giving it a conditional point of view and thus removing any dogmatism in the statement.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno"&gt;*{{cite journal  | last =Koller  | first =John M.  | title =Syādvadā as the Epistemological Key to the Jaina Middle Way Metaphysics of Anekāntavāda  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume = 50  | issue = 3  | pages =400–07  | location =Honolulu  | issn =0031-8221  |date=July 2000  | doi =10.1353/pew.2000.0009 | jstor=1400182  | ref =harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it ensures that each statement is expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions, ''syādvāda'' is known as ''saptibhaṅgīnāya'' or the theory of seven conditioned predications. These seven propositions, also known as ''[[saptabhangi|saptibhaṅgī]]'', are:&lt;ref name = "grimes"&gt;{{harvnb|Grimes|1996|p= 312}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''syād-asti''—in some ways, it is,
#''syād-nāsti''—in some ways, it is not,
#''syād-asti-nāsti''—in some ways, it is, and it is not,
#''{{IAST|syād-asti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is, and it is indescribable,
#''{{IAST|syād-nāsti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is not, and it is indescribable,
#''{{IAST|syād-asti-nāsti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is, it is not, and it is indescribable,
#''{{IAST|syād-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is indescribable.

Each of these seven propositions examines the complex and multifaceted nature of reality from a relative point of view of time, space, substance and mode.&lt;ref name="grimes" /&gt; To ignore the complexity of reality is to commit the fallacy of [[dogmatism]].&lt;ref name="kollerjurno"/&gt;

===Nayavāda===
''Nayavāda'' is the theory of partial standpoints or viewpoints. ''Nayavāda'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words—''naya'' ("partial viewpoint") and ''vāda'' ("[[school of thought]] or debate").&lt;ref name="Grimes202"&gt;{{harvnb|Grimes|1996|pp=202–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to arrive at a certain [[inference]] from a point of view. An object has infinite aspects to it, but when we describe an object in practice, we speak of only relevant aspects and ignore irrelevant ones.&lt;ref name="Grimes202" /&gt; This does not deny the other attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; they are just irrelevant from a particular perspective. As a type of [[critical philosophy]], ''nayavāda'' holds that all philosophical disputes arise out of confusion of standpoints, and the standpoints we adopt are, although we may not realise it, "the outcome of purposes that we may pursue".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McEvilley|2002|pp=335–337}}&lt;/ref&gt; While operating within the limits of language and seeing the complex nature of reality, Māhavīra used the language of ''nayas''. ''Naya'', being a partial expression of truth, enables us to comprehend reality part by part.&lt;ref name="natu"&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
{{Main|Ethics of Jainism}}
The Jain morality and ethics are rooted in its metaphysics and its utility towards the soteriological objective of liberation. Jaina ethics evolved out of the rules for the ascetics which are encapsulated in the ''[[mahavrata]]s'' or the five great vows.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

|- style="background:#FF0;"
|12.''atihti samvibhag''

|- style="background:gold;"
|}

These ethics are governed not only through the instrumentality of physical actions, but also through verbal action and thoughts. Thus, ahimsa has to be observed through mind, speech, and body. The other rules of the ascetics and laity are derived from these five major vows.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Jainism does not invoke fear of or reverence for God or conformity to the divine character as a reason for moral behaviour, and observance of the moral code is not necessary simply because it is God's will. Neither is its observance necessary simply because it is altruistic or humanistic, conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. Rather it is an [[ethical egoism|egoistic imperative]] aimed at self-liberation. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihants]]'' who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but because the life of the Arihants has demonstrated that such commandments were conducive to the Arihant's own welfare, helping them to reach spiritual victory. Just as the Arihants achieved {{IAST|''[[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]''}} or liberation by observing the moral code, so can anyone, who follows this path.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Science and Mathematics ==
===Atomism===
The most elaborate and well-preserved Indian theory of [[atomism]] comes from the philosophy of the [[Jainism|Jaina]] school, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. Some of the Jain texts that refer to matter and atoms are [[Pancastikayasara]], [[Kalpasutra (Jainism)|Kalpasutra]], [[Tattvarthasutra]] and Pannavana Suttam. The Jains envisioned the world as consisting wholly of atoms, except for souls.  Paramāņus or atoms were the basic building blocks of matter. Their concept of atoms was very similar to classical atomism, differing primarily in the specific properties of atoms.  Each atom, according to Jain philosophy, has one kind of taste, one smell, one color, and two kinds of touch, though it is unclear what was meant by "kind of touch".  Atoms can exist in one of two states: subtle, in which case they can fit in infinitesimally small spaces, and gross, in which case they have extension and occupy a finite space.  Certain characteristics of Paramāņu correspond with that of sub-atomic particles. For example, Paramāņu is characterized by continuous motion either in a straight line or in case of attractions from other Paramāņus, it follows a curved path. This corresponds with the description of orbit of electrons across the Nucleus. Ultimate particles are also described as particles with positive (Snigdha i.e. smooth charge) and negative  (Rūksa – rough) charges that provide them the binding force. Although atoms are made of the same basic substance, they can combine based on their eternal properties to produce any of six "aggregates", which seem to correspond with the Greek concept of "elements": earth, water, shadow, sense objects, karmic matter, and unfit matter.  To the Jains, karma was real, but was a naturalistic, mechanistic phenomenon caused by buildups of subtle karmic matter within the soul.  They also had detailed theories of how atoms could combine, react, vibrate, move, and perform other actions, which were thoroughly deterministic.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Contributions to Indian philosophy==
Jainism had a major influence in developing a system of philosophy and ethics that had a major impact on [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]. The scholarly research and evidences have shown that philosophical concepts that are typically Indian –  [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]], [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksa]], reincarnation and like – either have their origins in the [[shramana]] traditions or were propagated and developed by Jain teachers.  The sramanic ideal of mendicancy and renunciation, that the worldly life was full of suffering and that emancipation required giving up of desires and withdrawal into a lonely and contemplative life, was in stark contrast with the brahmanical ideal of an active and ritually punctuated life based on sacrifices, household duties and chants to deities. Sramanas developed and laid emphasis on Ahimsa, Karma, moksa and renunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pande|1994|pp=134–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Worthington|1982|pp=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools and traditions==
Jain philosophy arose from the shramana traditions. In its 2500 years post-Mahavira history, it remained fundamentally the same as preached by [[Mahavira]], who preached essentially the same religion as the previous [[Tirthankara]]. [[Harry Oldmeadow]] notes that the Jain philosophy remained fairly standard throughout history and the later elaborations only sought to further elucidate preexisting doctrine and avoided changing the ontological status of the components.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oldmeadow |2007|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schisms into [[Svetambara|Śvetāmbara]] and [[Digambar]]a traditions arose mainly on account of differences in question of practice of nudity amongst monks and liberation of women. Apart from these minor differences in practices, there are no major philosophical differences between the different sects of Jainism. The [[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvārthasūtra]], which encapsulates major philosophical doctrines, is accepted by all traditions of Jainism. This coherence in philosophical doctrine and consistency across different schools has led scholars like Jaini to remark that in the course of history of Jainism no heretical movements like Mahayana, tantric or [[bhakti]] movement developed outside mainstream Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|pp=31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there are traditions within Jainism, but basically the same philosophy that is at the core of Jainism.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Earlier traditions===
As per the tradition, Jain Sangh was divided into two major sects:
* Digambaras, the older sect hold that nudity is necessary for liberation and only men can attain the final stage of non-attachment to the body by remaining nude. They also hold that the canonical literature was eventually lost.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* Śvetāmbaras believe that women can attain liberation and that nudity is optional. Śvetāmbara scriptures support both ''acelakatva'', nudity in monks and ''sacelakatva'', the wearing of white clothes by ascetics. They also hold that the Jain canon was not lost.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The now defunct [[Yapaniya]] sect followed the Digambara practice of nudity and eating from the hands while standing up along with Śvetāmbara beliefs and texts. They notably also permitted their ascetics to be "half-clothed" (''ardhambara'') in public areas only. The Yapaniya sect was absorbed into the Digambara community during the medieval period.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Medieval traditions===
The period of 16th to 18th century was a period of reforms in Jainism. The following schools arose during this period :
* [[Sthanakvasi]] – The Sthanakvasis, arising from the Śvetāmbara tradition, rejected idol worship as unsanctioned by scriptures.
* [[Digambar Terapanth|Terapanthi (Digambara)]] – The Digambara Terapantha movement arose in protest against the institution of [[Bhattaraka]]s (Jain priestly class), usage of flowers and offerings in Jain temples, and worship of minor gods.
* [[Svetambar Terapanth|Terapanthi (Śvetāmbara)]] – The Terapanthi, also a non-iconic sect, arose from Sthanakvasis on account of differences in religious practices and beliefs.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Recent developments===
Recent events lead to dissatisfaction with the monastic tradition and its related emphasis on austerities saw the arising of two new sects within Jainism in the 20th century. These were essentially led by the laity rather than ascetics and soon became a major force to be reckoned with. The non-sectarian cult of [[Shrimad Rajchandra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rājacandra | website=Jainpedia|first=Jérôme|last=Petit| date=2016 | url=http://www.jainpedia.org/themes/people/studying-jainism/rajacandra.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was one of the major influences on Mahatma Gandhi, is now one of the most popular movements. Another cult founded by [[Kanjisvami]], laying stress on [[theological determinism]] and "knowledge of self", has gained a large following as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sangave |first=Vilas Adinath |authorlink=Vilas Adinath Sangave |title=Jaina Community: A Social Survey |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=FWdWrRGV_t8C |publisher=Popular Prakashan |date=1980 |orig-year=1959 |isbn=0-317-12346-7|page=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jain philosophers==
Jains hold the Jain doctrine to be eternal and based on universal principles. In the current time cycle, they trace the origins of its philosophy to [[Rishabhanatha]], the first ''Tīrthankara''. However, the tradition holds that the ancient [[Jain texts]] and [[Purvas]] which documented the Jain doctrine were lost and hence, historically, the Jain philosophy can be traced from [[Mahavira]]'s teachings. Post Mahavira many intellectual giants amongst the Jain ascetics contributed and gave a concrete form to the Jain philosophy within the parameters set by Mahavira. Following is the partial list of Jain philosophers and their contributions:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
&lt;!-- This is only a list of Jain monks who have made substantial contributions to Jain Philosophy. Please do not include names of any other Jain monks  --&gt;
* [[Kundakunda]] (1st—2nd century CE) – exponent of Jain metaphysics and [[Anekantavada#Nayavāda|Jain nayas]] dealing with the nature of the soul and its contamination by matter, author of ''[[Pancastikayasara|Pañcāstikāyasāra]]'' "Essence of the Five Existents", the ''Pravacanasāra'' "Essence of the Scripture", the ''[[Samayasara|Samayasāra]]'' "Essence of the Doctrine", ''[[Niyamasara|Niyamasāra]]'' "Essence of Discipline", ''Atthapāhuda'' "Eight Gifts", ''Dasabhatti'' "Ten Worships" and ''Bārasa Anuvekkhā'' "Twelve Contemplations".
* [[Samantabhadra (Jain monk)|Samantabhadra]] (2nd century CE) – first Jain writer to write on ''nyāya'', ([[Aptamimamsa|Apta-Mimāmsā]]), which has had the largest number of commentaries written on it by later Jain logicians.

The impact of Akalanka may be surmised by the fact that Jain ''Nyāya'' is also known as ''Akalanka Nyāya''.
* [[Pujyapada]] (6th century) – Jain philosopher, grammarian, Sanskritist. Composed ''Samadhitantra, Ishtopadesha'' and the ''Sarvarthasiddhi,'' a definitive commentary on the ''Tattvārthasūtra'' and ''Jainendra Vyakarana'', the first work on Sanskrit grammar by a Jain monk.

* Prabhacandra (8th–9th century) – Jain philosopher, composed a 106-Sutra Tattvarthasutra and exhaustive commentaries on two key works on Jain Nyaya, ''Prameyakamalamartanda'', based on Manikyanandi's ''Parikshamukham'' and ''Nyayakumudacandra'' on Akalanka's ''Laghiyastraya''.
* Abhayadeva (1057 to 1135) –  author of ''Vadamahrnava'' (Ocean of Discussions) which is a 2,500 verse ''tika'' (Commentary) of ''Sanmartika'' and a great treatise on logic.&lt;ref name="Jaini85"/&gt;
* [[Acharya Hemachandra]] (1089–1172) – Jain thinker, author, historian, grammarian and logician.

* Vadideva (11th century) – He was a senior contemporary of Hemacandra and is said to have authored ''Paramananayatattavalokalankara'' and its voluminous commentary ''syadvadaratnakara'' that establishes the supremacy of doctrine of [[Syādvāda]].
* Vidyanandi (11th century) – Jain philosopher, composed the brilliant commentary on Acarya Umasvami's Tattvarthasutra, known as ''Tattvarthashlokavartika''.
* [[Yasovijaya|Yaśovijaya]] (1624–1688) – Jain logician and one of the last intellectual giants to contribute to Jain philosophy. He specialised in ''Navya-Nyāya'' and wrote Vrttis (commentaries) on most of the earlier ''Jain Nyāya'' works by Samantabhadra, Akalanka, Manikyanandi, Vidyānandi, Prabhācandra and others in the then-prevalent ''Navya-Nyāya'' style. Yaśovijaya has to his credit a prolific literary output – more than 100 books in [[Sanskrit]], [[Prakrit]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]]. He is also famous for ''Jnanasara'' (essence of knowledge) and ''Adhayatmasara'' (essence of spirituality).

One of the themes in the research undertaken by John Strawson is the encounter between western and Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Encountering Islamic Law"&gt;, {{cite web|url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/shariah/jsrps.html|title=Encountering Islamic Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on Israel==
According to Strawson, the use of the term [[apartheid]] to describe Israel or Israeli policies has become commonplace in certain liberal and leftist circles. Strawson wrote that this label does not apply to Israel, and suggests that the use of the apartheid analogy is casual, unhistorical, and unhelpful.&lt;ref name="engage"&gt;[http://www.engageonline.org.uk/journal/index.php?journal_id=10&amp;article_id=34 Zionism and Apartheid: The Analogy in the Politics of International Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706123625/http://www.engageonline.org.uk/journal/index.php?journal_id=10&amp;article_id=34 |date=2010-07-06 }}.

'''Ka'Kabish''' is an archaeological site in the [[Orange Walk District]] of [[Belize]], Central America, located near the Maya sites of [[Lamanai]], El Pozito, and [[Blue Creek, Orange Walk|Blue Creek]]. It was once a moderate sized city, built as part of the [[Maya civilization]],&lt;ref name=cause/&gt; and has been determined to have been largely autonomous throughout its history. The modern communities of [[Indian Church, Belize|Indian Church]] and San Filipe are in close proximity to Ka’Kabish, and the [[Mennonites in Belize|Mennonite]] community of [[Blue Creek, Orange Walk|Blue Creek]] is slightly further afield. A road connecting [[Indian Church, Belize|Indian Church]] to San Filipe separates the site into two areas, the North Complex and the South Complex.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Haines, Helen R. 2014. “Six Years and Counting!:Overview of the 2013 Field Season”. In ''The 2012 Archaeological Report of the Ka’Kabish Archaeological Research Project (KARP).  Final Report of the 2012 field season submitted to The Institute of Archaeology, NICH, Belmopan, Belize'', edited by Helen R. Haines, pp. 7-11. Ka’Kabish Archaeological Research Project, Trent University, Peterborough.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tremain, Cara G. and Haines, Helen R. 2013. “Overview of the 2012 Research at Ka’Kabish”. In Ka’Kabish Archaeological Research Project (KARP) Interim Report on the 2012 Field Season, edited by Cara G. Tremain and Helen R. Haines, pp. 7-17. Ka’Kabish Archaeological Research Project, Trent University, Peterborough.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfredo Barrera Vasquez]]’s ''Diccionario Maya'' defines the name as; "KA’KAB-IS-AX 10: (place name); ka’kab: village, the seat of population, high land and strong; is: Ipomoea batatas, Lam: sweet + ax: wart; name of the archaeological ruins located near Numk’ini (Nun k’ini, Campeche)."&lt;ref&gt;Barrera Vasquez, A. 1995. ''Diccionario Maya'', 3rd edition. Mexico, DF: Editorial Porrua, S. A.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current name of the site is believed to be relatively modern, but its origin has resisted attempts to be traced.&lt;ref name=cause/&gt;

==History==
Ka'Kabish is believed to have been initially occupied during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Maya Late Pre-Classic Period]] (ca. 400 BCE- 200 CE) with one temple securely dated to this time and a second tentatively dated to this period.&lt;ref name=cause&gt;Haines, Helen R. 2008. "Causeway Terminus, Minor Centre, Elite Refuge, or Ritual Capital? Ka’Kabish, A New Puzzle on the Ancient Maya Landscape of North-Central Belize". In ''Research Reports in Belizean Archaeology'' Volume 5. Institute of Archaeology, NICH, Belize&lt;/ref&gt; Material recovered from the tops of some of the buildings suggest that the city was in use at least until end of the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Classic Period]] (900 CE), while evidence from the residential zone surrounding the city indicates a thriving occupation as late as the end of the Early Post-Classic Period (1200 CE).&lt;ref name=cause/&gt;

==Site description==
The site has only recently become the focus of intensive investigation. A mid-1990s study of the site core revealed a total of 27 monumental structures arranged around two plazas, a subsequent study increased the number of structures to 55.&lt;ref name=fp/&gt;

Within several of these structures the looted remains of tombs belonging to high status, possibly royal individuals, were discovered. One of these tombs was found to have possessed [[Glyph|painted glyphs]]. The style is part of a tradition of painted tombs first noted at Rio Azul in Northern Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Richard E.W. 1999 ''Rio Azul: An Ancient Maya City''. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological Investigations==
Ka’Kabish was first visited by [[David M. Pendergast]] of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] while he was working at the nearby site of [[Lamanai]], although the lack of a reliable road made work at the site unfeasible at that time. What was noted at the time was the evidence of wholesale illicit excavations, in which virtually every structure had been looted.&lt;ref&gt;Pendergast, David M. 1991 "And the Loot Goes On: Winning Some Battles, But Not the War." ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', vol. 18:89-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was identified initially for potential study in 1990 by members of the [[Maya Research Program]]. Due to potentially dangerous conditions in the area, a team did not return to Ka’Kabish until 1995, when formative mapping and surveying of the site was conducted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guderjan, Thomas H. 1996. "Kakabish: Mapping of a Maya Center". In ''Archaeological Research at Blue Creek, Belize. Progress Report of the Fourth (1995) Field Season'', edited by T. H. Guderjan, W. D. Driver and H. R. Haines, pp. 117-120. Maya Research Program, St. Mary's University, San Antonio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Helen R. Haines (TUARC, [[Trent University]]) began establishing the groundwork for the Ka’Kabish Archaeological Research Project (KARP) in 2005, with the permission of Belize’s Institute of Archeology, a branch of the National Institute of Culture and History (NICH).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Institute of Culture and History|url = http://nichbelize.org|website = nichbelize.org|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; KARP’s first field season was 2007, with a focus on clearing vegetation from, and remapping, the site’s South Complex. The North Complex of the site was remapped in 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since its inception, the Ka'Kabish Archaeological Research Project has expended efforts on mapping the site to gain an understanding of the extent of the site and the types of buildings present.&lt;ref name=fp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kakabish.org/field-project.html |title=Ka'Kabish Archaeological Research Project - Field Project |publisher=Kakabish.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the architectural arrangements provides significant clues as to the importance of the site and the role it might have played in the larger Maya political landscape.&lt;ref name=fp/&gt; Under a grant from the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council|Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]], first excavations at Ka’Kabish began in 2010 and have continued in the intervening years, with excavation seasons in 2011, 2013, and 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As of 2013, survey and excavations have located 90 structures, located in 8 groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Architectural features include two major temples, a ball court with circular ball court marker, and several large platforms (or range buildings) that likely served as royal or high status elite residences and/or administrative structures. Research has also been conducted on the numerous [[chultun]]s located at Ka’Kabish.

==Fundraising and Purchase==

Previously, the site sustained damage during the construction of the [[Indian Church, Belize|Indian Church]] to San Filipe Road, and two buildings were removed and their limestone material used for road fill for the road.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Looting has also been a problem, and several structures have been destabilized through looter’s trenches.&lt;ref&gt;Tremain, Cara G. (2011) ''Investigations in Looters’ Trenches at Ka’Kabish, Northern Belize: An Analysis of Ancient Maya Architecture and Construction Practices'' (M.A. thesis.) Trent University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2015, the land on which the site is located was administered by the San Filipe Land Committee, and was owned by three different landowners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Though the owners were supportive of archaeological research, Ka’Kabish was in danger due to encroaching agricultural expansion. This prompted an attempt to purchase the land and, under the auspices of NICH, establish Ka’Kabish as a National Park. A fundraising campaign raised $20,030 CND of a needed $70,000 CND, providing enough money to make a down payment on the site in July 2015. The funds for the campaign were managed by [[Trent University]], and the land was successfully removed from the Agricultural Land Registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CLICK HERE to support Help Save an Ancient Maya Site &amp; Rainforest Refuge|url = https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-save-an-ancient-maya-site-rainforest-refuge#/|website = Indiegogo|accessdate = 2015-11-01|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fieldschool==

In 2013, field school credit for college archaeological students began being offered via [[Trent University]]. Students participating in the field school stay in the village of [[Indian Church, Belize|Indian Church]] during their time with the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Field School Information|url = http://www.kakabish.org/field-school-information.html|website = Ka'Kabish Archaeological Research Project|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) has designated 132&lt;!-- Tentative count --&gt; [[World Heritage site]]s in [[Western Europe]]. These sites are located in 9 countries (also called "[[Sovereign state|state parties]]"); France and Germany are home to the most with 37 and 43,&lt;!-- Again, tentative count --&gt; while Liechtenstein and Monaco have no sites. There are ten sites which are shared between state parties both in and out of Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Number of World Heritage Properties by region |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat#s1 |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN division"&gt;{{cite web |url =http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#europe |title = Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions, geographical sub-regions, and selected economic and other groupings| year = 2010|work = Geographical region and composition of each region| publisher = [[United Nations Statistics Division]]| accessdate  = 24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first site from the region to be included on the list was the [[Aachen Cathedral]] in Germany in 1978, the year of the list's conception.&lt;ref name="SitebyYear"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;action=stat&amp;mode=table#s4 |title=Number of World Heritage properties inscribed each Year |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, UNESCO's [[World Heritage Committee]] may inscribe new sites on the list, or delist sites that no longer meet the criteria. Selection is based on [[World Heritage site#Selection criteria|ten criteria]]: six for [[cultural heritage]] (i&amp;ndash;vi) and four for [[natural heritage]] (vii&amp;ndash;x).&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Criteria for Selection |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some sites, designated "mixed sites," represent both cultural and natural heritage.&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/nominations/ |title=World Heritage List Nominations |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Europe, there are 121 cultural, 9 natural, and 2 mixed sites.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;

The World Heritage Committee may also specify that a site is [[World Heritage in Danger|endangered]], citing "conditions which threaten the very characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List."&lt;ref name="dangerlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/ |title=World Heritage in Danger |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, none of the sites in Western Europe are currently listed as endangered, though two German sites were previously listed: the Cologne Cathedral was marked as endangered in 2004 due to the construction of several high-rise buildings around it, but it was removed from the list in 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/264|title=Cologne Cathedral (Germany), Djoudj Bird Sanctuary (Senegal), Ichkeul National Park (Tunisia), and Hampi (India) removed from List of World Heritage in Danger|publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dresden Elbe Valley site was listed in 2006 in hopes of halting the construction of the four lane [[Waldschlösschen Bridge]] through the valley.&lt;ref name="dangerlist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dresden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/265 |title=World Heritage Committee threatens to remove Dresden Elbe Valley (Germany) from World Heritage List |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dresden2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/447 |title=World Heritage Committee keeps Dresden Elbe Valley on UNESCO World Heritage List, urging an end to building of bridge |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When construction continued as planned, it became the second site to be [[Former UNESCO World Heritage Sites|delisted]] as a World Heritage in 2009, the first being [[Oman]]'s [[Arabian Oryx Sanctuary]] two years earlier.&lt;ref name="DresdenDel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522 |title=Dresden is deleted from UNESCO’s World Heritage List |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List==

===Legend===
The list below uses a cultural definition of Western Europe (which includes [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], contrary to the [[United Nations Statistics Division]]'s definition). It also omits six sites outside of Europe belonging to European state parties: [[Curaçao]] (Netherlands), [[New Caledonia]] (France), [[Reunion Island]] (France), [[Gough Island]] (United Kingdom), [[Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands)|Henderson Island]] (United Kingdom), and [[Bermuda]] (United Kingdom). These sites are included in the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Africa|African]], [[List of World Heritage Sites in the Americas|American]], and [[List of World Heritage Sites in Oceania|Oceania]] lists. The table is sortable by column by clicking on the [[File:Sort both.gif]] at the top of the appropriate column; alphanumerically for the Site, Area, and Year columns; by state party for the Location column; and by criteria type for the Criteria column.

{{GeoGroupTemplate}}

'''Lomekwi''' 3 is the name of an [[archaeological site]] in [[Kenya]] where ancient [[stone tool]]s have been discovered  dating to [[Piacenzian|3.3 million years ago]], which make them the oldest ever found.

==Lomekwi 3==
In July 2011, a team of archeologists led by [[Sonia Harmand]] and Jason Lewis of [[Stony Brook University]], United States, were heading to a site near Kenya's [[Lake Turkana]] near where ''[[Kenyanthropus platyops]]'' fossils had previously been found.&lt;ref name=SA /&gt;&lt;ref name=science /&gt; The group made a wrong turn on the way and ended up at a previously unexplored region and decided to do some surveying. They quickly found some stone artifacts on the site, which they named Lomekwi 3.&lt;ref name=SA /&gt;  A year later they returned to the site for a full excavation.&lt;ref name=science /&gt; Harmand presented her findings at the annual meeting of the [[Paleoanthropology Society]] on April 14, 2015&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{cite news|title=Archaeologists Take Wrong Turn, Find World’s Oldest Stone Tools|work=Scientific American|date=April 15, 2015|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2015/04/15/archaeologists-take-wrong-turn-find-worlds-oldest-stone-tools/|accessdate=April 18, 2015|author=Kate Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published the full announcement and results on the cover of Nature on May 21, 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Artifacts ===
Around 20 well preserved artifacts have been dug up at Lomekwi 3 including anvils, cores, and flakes. An additional 130 artifacts were found on the surface. In one instance, Harmand's team was able to match a flake to its core, suggesting a [[hominin]] had made and discarded the tool at the site.&lt;ref name=science /&gt;  The tools were generally quite large – larger than the oldest known stone tools, recovered near Gona, in the [[Afar Region]] of [[Ethiopia]], in 1992. According to Harmand, it appeared that the tool makers had purposely selected large, heavy blocks of strong stone, ignoring smaller blocks of the same material found in the area.&lt;ref name=SA /&gt; She ruled out the possibility that the  tools were actually natural rock formations, saying "The artifacts were clearly [[knapping|knapped]] and not the result of accidental fracture of rocks".&lt;ref name=science /&gt; Analysis suggested the cores had been rotated as flakes were struck off.&lt;ref name=science /&gt; The purpose of the tools found at Lomekwi 3 is unclear, as animal bones found at the site do not bear any sign of hominin activity.&lt;ref name=SA /&gt; This is the greatest expression of late [[Neogene]] technology in human evolutionary history.

Based on the buried artifacts' stratigraphic position (in undisturbed sediment) relative to two layers of volcanic ash and known magnetic reversals, Harmand and her team dated the tools to 3.3 million years ago.&lt;ref name=SA /&gt;&lt;ref name=science /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harmand|first1=Sonia|title=3.3-million-year-old stone tools from Lomekwi 3, West Turkana, Kenya|journal=Nature|date=2015|volume=521|issue=7552|pages=310–315|doi=10.1038/nature14464|display-authors=etal|pmid=25993961}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finds at Lomekwi therefore represent the oldest stone tools ever discovered, predating the Gona tools by 700,000 years. The date also predates the genus ''[[Homo]]'' by 500,000 years, suggesting tool making arose with ''[[Australopithecus]]'' or ''[[Kenyanthropus]]'' (which was found near Lomekwi 3).&lt;ref name=SA /&gt;  Previously, evidence of stone tool use by ''Australopithecus'' has been suggested on the basis of marks on animal bones, but those findings have been hotly debated, with no scientific consensus forming on either side of the debate.&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite news|title=World’s oldest stone tools discovered in Kenya|work=Science|date=April 14, 2015|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2015/04/world-s-oldest-stone-tools-discovered-kenya|accessdate=April 18, 2015|author=Michael Balter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harmand said the Lomekwi 3 artifacts do not fit into the [[Oldowan]] tool making tradition and should be considered part of a distinct tradition, which she termed Lomekwian.&lt;ref name=SA /&gt; It has been hypothesized that tool making may have aided in the evolution of ''Homo'' into a distinct genus.&lt;ref name=science /&gt;  However, it is unclear whether the Lomekwian tools are related to those made by ''Homo'' species – it is possible the technology was forgotten and later rediscovered.&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt;

Independent researchers who have seen the tools are generally supportive of Harmand's conclusions.&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's oldest tools found near Africa's Lake Turkana|author=Brooks Hays|agency=UPI|date=April 16, 2015|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2015/04/16/Worlds-oldest-tools-found-near-Africas-Lake-Turkana/7751429187807/|accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington University]] anthropologist Alison Brooks said the tools "could not have been created by natural forces&amp;nbsp;... the dating evidence is fairly solid."&lt;ref name=science /&gt; [[Rick Potts]], head of the [[Human Origins Program]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], said the tools represented a more primitive style than known human-made tools, but something more sophisticated than what modern [[chimpanzee]]s do. "There's no doubt it's purposeful" toolmaking, he remarked.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|title=New Discovery Of World's Oldest Stone Tools|date=April 15, 2015|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/04/15/399937433/new-discovery-of-worlds-oldest-tools|publisher=NPR|author=Christopher Joyce|accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paleoanthropologist [[Zeresenay Alemseged]], who was responsible for the earlier research suggesting ''Australopithecus'' had made tools, also backed Harmand's conclusions.&lt;ref name=science /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3862">The '''Macaulay Library''' is the world's largest [[archive]] of [[animal sound]]s. It includes more than 175,000 [[audio recording]]s covering 75 percent of the world's [[bird]] [[species]]. There are an ever increasing numbers of [[insect]], [[fish]], [[frog]], and [[mammal]] recordings. The video archive includes over 50,000 clips, representing over 3,500 species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macaulaylibrary.org/faq |title=Ml: Faq |publisher=Macaulaylibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library is part of Cornell Lab of Ornithology of the [[Cornell University]].

Macaulay Library provides over the [[internet]] to the public more than 150,000 of their recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Uhr |url=http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/vogelstimmen-musik-workshops-politik-fuer-naive.1162.de.html?dram:article_id=245235 |title=Vogelstimmen, Musik-Workshops, Politik für Naive (Archiv) |publisher=Deutschlandradiokultur.de |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Arthur Augustus Allen and Peter Paul Kellogg made the first recordings of bird sound on May 18, 1929 in an Ithaca park, recording a [[song sparrow]], a [[house wren]], and a [[rose-breasted grosbeak]]. They use motion-picture film with synchronized sound. This was the Beginning of '''Cornell Library of Natural Sounds'''. Graduate student Albert R. Brand and Cornell undergraduate M. Peter Keane developed recording equipment for use in the open field. In the next two years they had successfully recorded more than 40 species of birds. In 1931 Peter Keane and True McLean (a Cornell professor in [[Electrical Engineering]]) designed and built a [[parabolic reflector]] for field recordings of bird songs. They using World War I parabola molds from the Cornell Physics Department. In 1940 Albert R. Brand produced an extensive bird song field guide album “American Bird Songs”. The sales of phonograph records of bird sounds remained a key source of income for the Lab of Ornithology since these days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macaulaylibrary.org/history |title=ML: History |publisher=Macaulaylibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recording Data ==
The basic data of the modern recordings contains: 
#Species name
#Date
#Time of day
#Location
#GPS coordinates
#Behavioral context of sound
#Natural sound or response to playback. If playback was used announce this on tape.
#Number of individuals
#Habitat description
#Weather (e.g. degree of overcast, air temperature, water temperature (important for amphibian recordings.)
#Recording equipment-Audio recorder make and model; microphone make and model; if used filter positions
#Distance to animal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macaulaylibrary.org/field-recording |title=ML: Field Recording |publisher=Macaulaylibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |accessdate=2008-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson was unarmed and died eight days later in the hospital.

His death was part of the inspiration for the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] in March 1965, a major event in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] that helped gain Congressional passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. This opened the door to millions of African Americans being able to vote again in Alabama and across the South, regaining participation as citizens in the political system for the first time since the turn of the 20th century, when they were [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] by state constitutions and discriminatory practices.&lt;ref name="fleming" /&gt;

In 2007 former trooper Fowler was indicted in Jackson's death, and in 2010 he pleaded guilty to manslaughter. He was sentenced to six months in prison.

==Early life==
Jimmie Lee Jackson was a [[deacon]] of the St. James Baptist Church in [[Marion, Alabama]], ordained in the summer of 1964. Jackson had tried to register to vote for four years, without success under the discriminatory system maintained by Alabama officials.  Jackson was inspired by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], who had come with other [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) staff to Selma, Alabama, to help local activists in their voter registration campaign. Jackson attended meetings several nights a week at Zion's Chapel Methodist Church.  His desire to vote led to his death at the hands of an Alabama State Trooper. It inspired [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] leader [[James Bevel]] to initiate and organize the dramatic  [[Selma to Montgomery marches]], which directly contributed to President [[Lyndon Johnson]] calling for, and Congress passing, the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].&lt;ref name="reed2"&gt;{{citation|last=Reed|first=Roy|title=Memorial Service Honors Negro Slain in Alabama Rights March|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|page=17|date=March 1, 1965|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F1FF73D54167A93C3A91788D85F418685F9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On the night of February 18, 1965, about 500 people organized by the SCLC activist [[C. T. Vivian]] left Zion United Methodist Church in Marion and attempted a peaceful walk to the [[Perry County, Alabama|Perry County]] jail, about a half a block away, where young civil-rights worker [[James Orange]] was being held. The marchers planned to sing hymns and return to the church. Police later said that they believed the crowd was planning a jailbreak.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{Citation|last=Davis|first=Townsend|coauthors=|title=Weary Feet, Rested Souls: A Guided History of the Civil Rights Movement|publisher=W.

They were met at the post office&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; by a line of Marion police officers, sheriff's deputies and Alabama state troopers.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt; During the standoff, streetlights were abruptly turned off (some sources say they were shot out by the police),&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; and the police began to beat the protesters.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; Among those beaten were two [[United Press International]] photographers, whose cameras were smashed, and [[NBC News]] correspondent [[Richard Valereani|Richard Valeriani]], who was beaten so badly that he was hospitalized.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; The marchers turned and scattered back toward the church.

Jackson, his mother Viola Jackson, and his 82-year-old grandfather Cager Lee, ran into Mack's Café behind the church, pursued by state troopers. Police clubbed Lee to the floor in the kitchen;&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt; when Viola attempted to pull the police off, she was also beaten. When Jackson tried to protect his mother, one trooper threw him against a cigarette machine. A second trooper shot Jackson twice in the abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kotz|first=Nick|authorlink=Nick Kotz|title=Judgment Days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Laws that Changed America|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2005|location=Boston|pages=275, 276|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FgvF5_nPPH8C
|isbn=0-618-08825-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Bonard Fowler]] later admitted to pulling the trigger, saying he thought Jackson was going for his gun.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt; The wounded Jackson fled the café, suffering additional blows by the police, and collapsed in front of the bus station.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt;

In the presence of [[FBI]] officials, Jackson told a lawyer, [[Oscar Adams]] of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], that he was "clubbed down" by state troopers after he was shot and had run away from the café.&lt;ref name="reed"&gt;{{citation|last=Reed|first=Roy|title=Wounded Negro Dies in Alabama|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|pages=1, 10|date=February 27, 1965|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1965/02/27/archives/wounded-negro-dies-in-alabama-he-said-trooper-shot-him-statement-by.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson died of his wounds at Good Samaritan Hospital in [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]], on February 26, 1965.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; Sister Michael Anne, an administrator at Good Samaritan, later said there were powder burns on Jackson's abdomen, indicating that he was shot at very close range.&lt;ref name="reed"/&gt;

Jackson was buried in Heard Cemetery, an old slave burial ground, next to his father, with a headstone paid for by the Perry County Civic League. His headstone has been vandalized, bearing the marks of at least one shotgun blast.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Jackson's death led [[James Bevel]], SCLC Director of Direct Action and the director of SCLC's Selma Voting Rights Movement, to initiate and organize the first Selma to Montgomery march to present a way for the citizens of Marion and Selma to direct the anger over Jackson's death into a positive outcome. It also was called to publicize the effort to gain voter's registration reform. Held a few days later, on March 7, 1965, the march became known as "[[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]" for the violent response of state troopers and the sheriff's posse, who attacked and beat the protesters after they walked over the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] and left the city.&lt;ref name=fleming/&gt; The events captured international attention, raising widespread support for the voting rights campaign. In the third march to Montgomery, which began on March 21, protesters traveled the entire way, and a total of 25,000 people peacefully entered the city protected by federal troops and Alabama National Guard under federal command.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/selma_montgomery.htm Selma to Montgomery March] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122214150/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/selma_montgomery.htm |date=January 22, 2009|publisher=The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute, [[Stanford University]]|accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 1965, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] announced his federal bill to authorize oversight of local practices and enforcement by the federal government; it was passed by Congress as the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. After the act was passed, Jimmie Lee Jackson's grandfather Cager Lee, who had marched with him in February 1965 in Marion, voted for the first time at the age of 84.

The '''National Museum of History of Moldova''' ({{lang-ro|Muzeul Național de Istorie a Moldovei}}) is a museum in [[Central Chişinău]], [[Moldova]].

== Overview ==
Over 263,000 exhibits, 165,000 of which belong to the national heritage, are exhibited in the National Museum of History, founded in 1983 on the former Regional Lyceum. It is situated on 121a, 31 August 1989 str., in the historical center of Chişinău. In the museum yard there is the [[Capitoline Wolf, Chişinău|Capitoline Wolf]], the copy of the one in [[Rome]]. Every year almost 15 exhibitions are held in the museum; which are important events in Moldova. The museum is structured into many scientific sections: Ancient History and Archaeology, Medieval History, History of Basarabia, Contemporary History, Treasures.

== History ==
[[File:Cucuteni IMG 3675.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]]
Neolithic and Stone Age Collection]]
The National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova is one of the most important museum institutions of the Republic of Moldova, in terms of its collection and scientific prestige.

[[File:Bonz antic Chisinau mai 2014 -0065.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Olanesti treasure is unique in Europe. Discovered in 1960 the artefacts are dated to the 5th century BC. The treasure contains six helmets, five [[greave]]s and an oil lamp. All the pieces are from the army of the Alexander the Great under [[Zopyrion]] command]]

[[File:Brosa slavica Chisinau mai 2014 -0072.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Late Antiquity]]

The museum was established on December 21, 1983, when there was issued the Order of the Ministry of Culture No. 561 “On reprofiling of the Museums” (on the basis of the Joint Decree of the Central Committee of the CPM and the Council of Ministers of MSSR “On the utilization of the historical monument – the edifice of the former Chisinau Boys’ Gymnasia where S. Lazo studied” from 29 November 1983).[[ File:Nagant Chisinau mai 2014 -0123.JPG|thumb|left|180px|1939 [[Fabrique d'armes Émile et Léon Nagant|Nagant]] revolver]][[File:Prppaganda poster Chisinau mai 2014 -0085.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Propaganda Poster]]
The State Museum of History of MSSR was created on the basis of the Republican Museum of Military Glory, into which it was incorporated, and the historical collection of the State Museum of History and Regional Studies of MSSR. It was housed in the restoring historical building of the former Chisinau Boys’ Gymnasia No.1, where formerly the Republican Museum of Military Glory had been located.

On October 22, 1991, by the Order of the Ministry of Culture No. 231 “On perfection of the republican museums’ activity”, the State Museum of History of MSSR was renamed to the National Museum of History of Moldova.

In 2006 the National Museum of History of Moldova was reorganized into the National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova through absorption of the Museum of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova, according to the Decree of the Government of the Republic of Moldova No.1326 “On the measures of optimization of infrastructure in the field of science and innovation” from 14 December 2005.

At present the National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova is subordinate to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Moldova, its scientific activity being coordinated by the Academy of Sciences of Moldova.

The museum collections, which initially consisted of the collections of the Republican Museum of Military Glory and the State Museum of History and Regional Studies of MSSR, every year were enriching with items of real scientific value through research, donations, and acquisitions. Besides, in 1989–1995 and 2006–2007, large transfers of collections from a number of broken up museums – the Republican Museum of Friendship Among the Peoples, the Museum of History of the CPM, the Republican Museum of History of the Komsomol, the Republican Museum of G.I. Kotovsky and S.G. Lazo, the Republican Museum of the History of Religion, the Memorial Museum of Bulgarian Volunteers, and the Museum of Archaeology of The Academy of Sciences of Moldova – also contributed to the growth and diversity of the museum property.

Today,{{when|date=February 2012}} the National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova owns 322,172 items, the diversity of which covers the history of Moldova over the centuries, from prehistoric times to the present, telling about the land, facts, events, and outstanding people.

In 1991, the first permanent historical exhibition “Pages of Centuries-old History of Moldova”, covering the period from the oldest times to 1940, was opened to the public. It was located in three rooms of the 1st floor, with an area of 645 sq. m., containing about 900 exhibit items. The exhibition illustrated the features of the area between the Prut and Dniester in the context of the history of medieval Moldavian state. As to the period after the dismemberment of Moldova in 1812, in the exhibition there was presented only the history of Bessarabia.

In 1997, the permanent historical exhibition was redesigned in content, placement, and by the method of presentation. It expanded to the entire first floor, occupying six rooms with an area of 1,400 sq. m. Chronological framework of the exhibition includes the period from the Paleolithic to the end of the fifth decade of the 20th century.


In 2006–2007, the museum was in a new process of rebuilding of the permanent exhibition, intending to make radical changes in terms of vision and the content of exhibits, representing the section of prehistory and ancient history. Underlying these changes are the collections transferred from the former Museum of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova.  Of course, the current formula of the permanent exhibition is an intermediate. Now there is conceptually and thematically developing a new vision of the exhibition of the National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova.

In August 1990, in the ground floor of the museum there was open to the public the Diorama of the Iasi – Chisinau Operation, and in 1994, in the basement – the exhibition of items made of precious metals “Treasure-house”. 

The museum also offers the public diverse temporary exhibitions, which complement the permanent exhibition and contribute to the promotion of the museum cultural and historical property.  During the 27 years of its existence, the museum has organized about 189 temporary exhibitions (at the museum, outside the museum, and abroad), based on its own collections as well as in collaboration with other cultural and research institutions.

== The edifice ==
The National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova from the very beginning was located in the historical building of the former Chisinau Boys’ Gymnasia No.1, later the Boy’s Lyceum named after B.P. Hasdeu (in 1945–1963 in the premises there was housed the frontier detachment “Nistru”, and in 1963–1977 – the Polytechnic Institute), that was in the process of restoration.

The earthquake of 1977 has played a tragic role in the history of this monument, causing serious damage that could lead to a total destruction of the building. Restoration work, started in 1979, was halted because, due to the severe destruction, the building was beyond repair. 

The old building was demolished and replaced by a new one (the construction lasted from 1980 to 1987), which retained only the exterior of the historical monument, built in eclectic style, and decorative elements of the gymnasia assembly hall, repeated in three domical rooms of the new building. 

Thus, the new museum edifice, in operation from 1987, is a modern two-storey monumental building facing the 31 August 1989 Street.  It has 12 exhibition rooms and a diorama, with a total area of 5,700 sq. m.

The museum has five branches: Exhibitions of Military Technology, The Sciusev House and Museum (both in [[Chişinău]]), The C. Stamati House and Museum ([[Ocniţa]]), Lazo’s Manson (in Piatra), [[Charles XII of Sweden|Carol the XIIth]]'s House and Museum in [[Varniţa, Anenii Noi|Varniţa]].

Countries using or considering to use [[hydraulic fracturing]] have implemented different regulations, including developing federal and regional legislation, and local zoning limitations.&lt;ref name="nolon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Negro"/&gt; In 2011, after public pressure France became the first nation to ban hydraulic fracturing, based on the [[precautionary principle]] as well as the principal of preventive and corrective action of environmental hazards.&lt;ref name="Bweek 31.03.2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bweek 04.10.2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;  The ban was upheld by an October 2013 ruling of the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]].&lt;ref name="AutoZN-1"/&gt; Some other countries have placed a temporary moratorium on the practice.&lt;ref name="moore"/&gt;  Countries like the United Kingdom and [[South Africa]], have lifted their bans, choosing to focus on regulation instead of outright prohibition.&lt;ref name="BakewellSally"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wcn170912"/&gt;  Germany has announced draft regulations that would allow using hydraulic fracturing for the exploitation of shale gas deposits with the exception of [[wetlands|wetland areas]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg260213"/&gt;

The European Union has adopted a recommendation for minimum principles for using high-volume hydraulic fracturing.&lt;ref name="recommendation"/&gt;  Its regulatory regime requires full disclosure of all additives.&lt;ref name="EU"/&gt;  In the United States, the Ground Water Protection Council launched FracFocus.org, an online voluntary disclosure database for hydraulic fracturing fluids funded by oil and gas trade groups and the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;ref name="HassBenjamin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SoraghanMike02"/&gt;  Hydraulic fracturing is excluded from the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]]'s underground injection control's regulation, except when [[diesel fuel]] is used. The EPA assures surveillance of the issuance of drilling permits when [[diesel fuel]] is employed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

On 17 December 2014, New York state issued a statewide ban on [[hydraulic fracturing]], becoming the second state in the United States to issue such a ban after [[Vermont]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20141217"&gt;{{cite news |author=Editorial Board |title=Gov. Cuomo Makes Sense on Fracking |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/opinion/gov-cuomo-makes-sense-on-fracking.html |date=17 December 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=18 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

=== Risk-based approach ===

The main tool used by this approach is risk assessment. A [[risk assessment]] method, based on experimenting and assessing risk ex-post, once the technology is in place. In the context of hydraulic fracturing, it means that drilling permits are issued and exploitation conducted before the potential risks on the environment and human health are known. The risk-based approach mainly relies on a discourse that sacralizes [[innovation|technological innovations]] as an intrinsic good, and the analysis of such innovations, such as hydraulic fracturing, is made on a sole [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit]] framework, which does not allow [[Risk|prevention]] or ex-ante debates on the use of the technology.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; This is also referred to as "learning-by-doing".&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"/&gt; A [[risk assessment]] method has for instance led to regulations that exist in the hydraulic fracturing in the United States (EPA will release its study on the effect of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater in 2014, though hydraulic fracturing has been used for more than 60 years.  Commissions that have been implemented in the US to regulate the use of hydraulic fracturing have been created after hydraulic fracturing had started in their area of regulation. This is for instance the case in the Marcellus shale area where three regulatory committees were implemented ex-post.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

Academic scholars who have studied the perception of hydraulic fracturing in the North of England  have raised two main critiques of this approach. Firstly, it takes scientific issues out of the [[public debate]] since there is no debate on the use of a technology but on its effects. Secondly, it does not prevent [[environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing|environmental harm]] from happening since risks are taken then assessed instead of evaluated then taken as it would be the case with a [[precautionary principle|precautionary]] approach to scientific debates. The relevance and reliability of [[risk assessments]] in hydraulic fracturing communities has also been debated amongst environmental groups, health scientists, and industry leaders. A study has epitomized this point: the participants to regulatory committees of the Marcellus shale have, for a majority, raised concerns about public health although nobody in these regulatory committees had expertise in public health. That highlights a possible underestimation of public health risks due to hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, more than a quarter of the participants raised concerns about the neutrality of the regulatory committees given the important weigh of the hydraulic fracturing industry.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; The risks, to some like the participants of the Marcellus Shale regulatory committees, are overplayed and the current research is insufficient in showing the link between hydraulic fracturing and [[environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing#health risks|adverse health effects]], while to others like local environmental groups the risks are obvious and [[risk assessment]] is underfunded.&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt;

=== Precaution-based approach ===

The second approach relies on the [[precautionary principle]] and the principal of preventive and corrective action of environmental hazards, using the best available techniques with an acceptable economic cost to insure the protection, the valuation, the restoration, management of spaces, resources and natural environments, of animal and vegetal species, of ecological diversity and equilibriums.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; The [[precautionary principle|precautionary]] approach has led to regulations as implemented in [[hydraulic fracturing by country#France|France]] and [[hydraulic fracturing in the United States#Vermont|Vermont]], banning hydraulic fracturing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2012/Acts/ACT152.pdf "Vermont Act 152"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such an approach is called upon by social sciences and the public as studies have shown in the North of England and Australia.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt; Indeed, in Australia, the anthropologist who studied the use of hydraulic fracturing concluded that the risk-based approach was closing down the debate on the ethics of such a practice, therefore avoiding questions on broader concerns that merely the risks implied by hydraulic fracturing. In the North of England, levels of concerns registered in the deliberative focus groups studied were higher regarding the framing of the debate, meaning the fact that people did not have a voice in the energetic choices that were made, including the use of hydraulic fracturing. Concerns relative to risks of seismicity and health issues were also important to the public, but less than this. A reason for that is that being withdrawn the right to participate in the decision-making triggered opposition of both supporters and opponents of hydraulic fracturing.

The points made to defend such an approach often relate to [[climate change]] and the [[environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing|impact on the direct environment]]; related to public concerns on the rural landscape for instance in the UK.&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt; Energetic choices indeed affect climate change since greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels extraction such as shale gas and oil contribute to climate change. Therefore, people have in the UK raised concerns about the exploitation of these resources, not just hydraulic fracturing as a method. They would hence prefer a precaution-based approach to decide whether or not, regarding the issue of climate change, they want to exploit shale gas and oil.

== Framing of the debate ==

There are two main areas of interest regarding how debates on hydraulic fracturing for the exploitation of [[unconventional oil]] and [[Shale gas|gas]] have been conducted.

=== "Learning-by-doing" and the displacement of ethics ===

A risk-based approach is often referred to as "learning-by-doing" by social sciences. Social sciences have raised two main critiques of this approach. Firstly, it takes scientific issues out of the public debate since there is no debate on the use of a technology but on its impacts. Secondly, it does not prevent [[environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing|environmental harm]] from happening since risks are taken then assessed instead of evaluated then taken. Public concerns are shown to be really linked to these issues of scientific approach. Indeed, the public in the North of England for instance fears "the denial of the deliberation of the values embedded in the development and application of that technology, as well as the future it is working towards" more than risks themselves. The legitimacy of the method is only questioned after its implementation, not before. This vision separates risks and effects from the values entitled by a technology. For instance, hydraulic fracturing entitles a transitional fuel for its supporters whereas for its opponents it represents a [[fossil fuel]] exacerbating the [[greenhouse effect]] and [[global warming]]. Not asking these questions leads to seeing only the mere economic [[cost-benefit analysis]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt;

This is linked to a pattern of preventing non-experts from taking part in scientific-technological debates, including their ethical issues. An answer to that problem is seen to be increased [[public participation]] so as to have the public deciding which issues to address and what political and ethical norms to adopt as a society. Another public concern with the "learning-by-doing" approach is that the speed of innovation may exceed the speed of regulation and since innovation is seen as serving private interests, potentially at the expense of [[common good|social good]], it is a matter of public concern. [[Science and Technology Studies]] have theorized "slowing-down" and the [[precautionary principle]] as answers. The claim is that the possibility of an issue is legitimate and should be taken into account before any action is taken.&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt;

=== Variations in risk-assessment of environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing ===

Issues also exist regarding the way [[risk assessment]] is conducted and whether it reflects some interests more than others. Firstly, an issue exists about whether [[risk assessment]] authorities are able to judge the [[environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing#health risks|impact of hydraulic fracturing in public health]]. A study conducted on the advisory committees of the [[Marcellus Shale]] gas area&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;  has shown that not a single member of these committees had [[public health]] expertise and that some concern existed about whether the commissions were not biased in their composition. Indeed, among 51 members of the committees, there is no evidence that a single one has any expertise in [[environmental health|environmental public health]], even after enlarging the category of experts to "include medical and health professionals who could be presumed to have some health background related to [[environmental health]], however minimal". This cannot be explained by the purpose of the committee since all three [[executive orders]] of the different committees mentioned [[environmental health|environmental public health]] related issues. Another finding of the authors is that a quarter of the opposed comments mentioned the possibility of bias in favor of gas industries in the composition of committees. The authors conclude saying that political leaders may not want to raise [[public health]] concerns not to handicap further economic development due to hydraulic fracturing.

Secondly, the conditions to allow hydraulic fracturing are being increasingly strengthened due to the move from governmental agencies' authority over the issue to elected officials' authority over it. The Shale Gas Drilling Safety Review Act of 2014 issued in [[hydraulic fracturing in the United States#Maryland|Maryland]]&lt;ref name="AutoZN-2"/&gt;  forbids the issuance of drilling permits until a high standard "[[risk assessment]] of [[public health]] and [[environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing|environmental hazards]] relating to hydraulic fracturing activities" is conducted for at least 18 months based on the Governor's [[executive order]].

== Institutional discourse and the public ==

A [[qualitative study]] using deliberative focus groups has been conducted in the North of England,&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt; where there is a big [[shale gas]] reservoir exploited by hydraulic fracturing. These group discussions reflect many concerns on the issue of the use of [[unconventional oil]] and [[unconventional gas|gas]]. There is a concern about trust linked with a doubt on the ability or will of public authorities to work for the greater [[common good|social good]] since private interests and profits of industrial companies are seen as corruptive powers. Alienation is also a concern since the feeling of a game rigged against the public rises due to "decision making being made on your behalf without being given the possibility to voice an opinion". Exploitation also arises since economic rationality that is seen as favoring short-termism is accused of seducing [[policy-maker]]s and industry. Risk is accentuated by what is hydraulic fracturing as well as what is at stake, and "blind spots" of current knowledge as well as [[risk assessment]] analysis are accused of increasing the potentiality of negative outcomes. Uncertainty and ignorance are seen as too important in the issue of hydraulic fracturing and decisions are therefore perceived as rushed, which is why participants favored some form of [[precautionary principle|precautionary approach]]. There is a major fear on the possible disconnection between the public's and the authorities' visions of what is a good choice for the good reasons.

It also appears that media coverage and institutional responses are widely inaccurate to answer public concerns. Indeed, institutional responses to public concerns are mostly inadequate since they focus on [[risk assessment]] and giving information to the public that is considered anxious because ignorant.

{{Nanotechnology}}

Because of the ongoing controversy on the [[implications of nanotechnology]], there is significant debate concerning whether [[nanotechnology]] or nanotechnology-based [[List of nanotechnology applications|products]] merit special government [[regulation]]. This mainly relates to when to assess new substances prior to their release into the market, community and environment.

[[Nanotechnology]] refers to an increasing number of commercially available products – from socks and trousers to tennis racquets and cleaning cloths. Such nanotechnologies and their accompanying industries have triggered calls for increased community participation and effective regulatory arrangements.&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katz E, Lovel R, Mee W, Solomon F |title=Social perspectives on nanotechnology research and development: a view from Australia |publisher= Participatory approaches in science and Technology, Edinburgh Scotland |year=2006 |url=http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/PATHconference/PATHconference_proceeding_ps7.html#session7.2.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these calls have presently not led to such comprehensive [[regulation]] to oversee research and the commercial application of nanotechnologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marchant G, Sylvester D | title=Transnational Models for Regulation of Nanotechnology |journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics| volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=714–725 |year=2006 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720X.2006.00091.x |pmid=17199813}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any comprehensive labeling for products that contain [[nanoparticles]] or are derived from nano-processes.

Regulatory bodies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] in the U.S. or the [[Health and Consumer Protection Directorate]] of the European Commission have started dealing with the potential risks posed by nanoparticles. So far, neither engineered nanoparticles nor the products and materials that contain them are subject to any special regulation regarding production, handling or labelling.

==Managing risks: human and environmental health and safety==
{{further|Implications of nanotechnology|Nanotoxicology}}

Studies of the health impact of airborne particles generally shown that for toxic materials, smaller particles are more toxic. This is due in part to the fact that, given the same mass per volume, the dose in terms of particle numbers increases as particle size decreases.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Based upon available data, it has been argued that current risk assessment methodologies are not suited to the hazards associated with nanoparticles; in particular, existing [[toxicological]] and eco-toxicological methods are not up to the task; exposure evaluation (dose) needs to be expressed as quantity of nanoparticles and/or surface area rather than simply mass; equipment for routine detecting and measuring nanoparticles in air, water, or soil is inadequate; and very little is known about the physiological responses to nanoparticles.

Regulatory bodies in the U.S. as well as in the EU have concluded that nanoparticles form the potential for an entirely new risk and that it is necessary to carry out an extensive analysis of the risk.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The challenge for regulators is whether a matrix can be developed which would identify nanoparticles and more complex nanoformulations which are likely to have special toxicological properties or whether it is more reasonable for each particle or formulation to be tested separately.

The [[ICON: The International Council on Nanotechnology|International Council on Nanotechnology]] maintains a database and Virtual Journal of scientific papers on environmental, health and safety research on nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icon.rice.edu/virtualjournal.cfm/ Virtual Journal of Nanotechnology Environment, Health and Safety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318020035/http://www.icon.rice.edu/virtualjournal.cfm |date=2010-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The database currently has over 2000 entries indexed by particle type, exposure pathway and other criteria. The [[Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies]] (PEN) currently lists 807 products that manufacturers have voluntarily identified that use nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanotechproject.org/index.php?id=44&amp;action=intro|title=Nanotechnology - Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No labeling is required by the FDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/43305/story.htm
|title = FDA Says No New Labeling For Nanotech Products|accessdate = 2007-10-19|last = Dixon
|first = Kim |date = 2007-07-21|work = Reuters News Service|publisher = Planet Ark}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that number could be significantly higher. "The use of nanotechnology in consumer products and industrial applications is growing rapidly, with the products listed in the PEN inventory showing just the tip of the iceberg" according to PEN Project Director David Rejeski [http://www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/6697/]. A list of those products that have been voluntarily disclosed by their manufacturers is located here [http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/browse/products/].

The [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] that must be issued for certain materials often does not differentiate between bulk and nanoscale size of the material in question and even when it does these MSDS are advisory only.

==Democratic governance==
Many{{who|date=January 2012}} argue that government has a responsibility to provide opportunities for the public to be involved in the development of new forms of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Democratic Technologies? Final Report of the Nanotechnology Engagement Group |url=http://www.involve.org.uk/negreport }}&lt;/ref&gt; Community engagement can be achieved through various means or mechanisms. An online journal article&lt;ref name="PublicUnderstanding"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rowe G, Horlick-Jones T, Walls J, Pidgeon N |title=Difficulties in evaluating public engagement initiatives: reflections on an evaluation of the UK GM Nation? |journal=Public Understanding of Science |volume=14 |pages=331–352 |url=http://pus.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/14/4/331 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107033014/http://pus.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/14/4/331 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-11-07 |year=2005 |doi=10.1177/0963662505056611 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies traditional approaches such as referenda, consultation documents, and advisory committees that include community members and other stakeholders. Other conventional approaches include public meetings and "closed" dialog with stakeholders. More contemporary engagement processes that have been employed to include community members in decisions about nanotechnology include citizens' juries and consensus conferences. Leach and Scoones (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;45)&lt;ref name="Demos"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Melissa Leach |author2=Ian Scoones |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Slow Race: Making Technology Work for the Poor |publisher=Demos |url=http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/theslowrace |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112225426/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/theslowrace |archivedate=2010-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that since that “most debates about science and technology options involve uncertainty, and often ignorance, public debate about regulatory regimes is essential.”

It has been argued{{by whom|date=January 2012}} that limited nanotechnology labeling and regulation may exacerbate potential human and environmental health and safety issues associated with nanotechnology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bowman D, Hodge G |title=A Small Matter of Regulation: An International Review of Nanotechnology Regulation |journal=Columbia Science and Technology Law Review |volume=8 |pages=1–32 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA.

Community education, engagement and consultation tend to occur "downstream": once there is at least a moderate level of awareness, and often during the process of disseminating and adapting technologies. "Upstream" engagement, by contrast, occurs much earlier in the innovation cycle and involves: "dialogue and debate about future technology options and pathways, bringing the often expert-led approaches to horizon scanning, technology foresight and scenario planning to involve a wider range of perspectives and inputs."&lt;ref name="Demos" /&gt; Daniel Sarewitz Director of Arizona State University’s Consortium on Science, Policy and Outcomes, argues that "by the time new devices reach the stage of commercialization and regulation, it is usually too late to alter them to correct problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brainard J. |title=A More Social Science |url=http://cspo.org/home/newatcspo/sarewitz_chronicle.htm |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706130122/http://www.cspo.org/home/newatcspo/sarewitz_chronicle.htm |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Xenos, et al. argue that upstream engagement can be utilized in this area through anticipated discussion with peers. Upstream engagement in this sense is "meant to create the best possible conditions for sound policy making and public judgments based on carefull assessment of objective information".&lt;ref name="Stimulating Upstream Engagement 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xenos|first1=Michael|last2=Becker|first2=Amy|last3=Anderson|first3=Ashley|last4=Brossard|first4=Dominique|last5=Scheufele|first5=Dietram|title=Stimulating Upstream Engagement: An Experimental Study of Nanotechnology Information Seeking|journal=Social Science Quarterly|date=December 2011|volume=92|issue=5|pages=1192–1214|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2011.00814.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion may act as a catalyst for upstream engagement by prompting accountability for individuals to seek and process additional information ("anticipatory elaboration"). However, though anticipated discussion did lead to participants seeking further information, Xenos et al. found that factual information was not primarily sought out; instead, individuals sought out opinion pieces and editorials.&lt;ref name="Stimulating Upstream Engagement 2011"/&gt;

The stance that the [[research and development|research, development]] and use of nanotechnology should be subject to control by the [[public sector]] is sometimes referred to as [[nanosocialism]].

===Newness===
The question of whether nanotechnology represents something 'new' must be answered to decide how best nanotechnology should be regulated.&lt;ref name="Futures"/&gt; The Royal Society&lt;ref name="Royal"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering |title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties |year=2004 |url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended that the UK government assess chemicals in the form of nanoparticles or nanotubes as new substances. Subsequent to this, in 2007 a coalition of [https://web.archive.org/web/20100831042620/http://www.icta.org/global/actions.cfm?page=15&amp;type=366&amp;topic=8 over forty groups] called for nanomaterials to be classified as new substances, and regulated as such.

Despite these recommendations, chemicals comprising nanoparticles that have previously been subject to assessment and regulation may be exempt from regulation, regardless of the potential for different risks and impacts. In contrast, nanomaterials are often recognized as 'new' from the perspective of [[intellectual property rights]] (IPRs), and as such are commercially protected via patenting laws.

There is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auplat|first=Claire|title=The Challenges of nanotechnology policy making - Part 1|journal=Global Policy|year=2012|volume=3|issue=4|pages=492–500|doi=10.1111/j.1758-5899.2011.00159.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1758-5899.2011.00159.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auplat|first=Claire|title=The challenges of nanotechnology policy making - Part 2|journal=Global Policy|year=2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=101–107|doi=10.1111/j.1758-5899.2011.00160.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1758-5899.2011.00160.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some non-nanotechnology specific regulatory agencies currently cover some products and processes (to varying degrees) – by "bolting on" nanotechnology to existing regulations – there are clear gaps in these regimes. This enables some nanotechnology applications to figuratively "slip through the cracks" without being covered by any regulations. An example of this has occurred in the US, and involves nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TI02) for use in sunscreen where they create a clearer cosmetic appearance. In this case, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the immediate health effects of exposure to nanoparticles of [[titanium dioxide]] (TI02) for consumers. However, they did not review its impacts for aquatic ecosystems when the sunscreen rubs off, nor did the EPA, or any other agency.&lt;ref name="Futures"/&gt; Similarly the Australian equivalent of the FDA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved the use of nanoparticles in sunscreens (without the requirement for package labelling) after a thorough review of the literature, on the basis that although nanoparticles of TI02 and [[zinc oxide]] (ZN0) in sunscreens do produce free radicals and oxidative DNA damage ''in vitro'', such particles were unlikely to pass the dead outer cells of the [[stratum corneum]] of human skin; a finding which some academics have argued seemed not to apply the [[precautionary principle]] in relation to prolonged use on children with cut skin, the elderly with thin skin, people with diseased skin or use over flexural creases.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA, Nasu H, Murray K, Bowman D. Sunscreen Safety: The Precautionary Principle, The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and Nanoparticles in SunscreensNanoethics (2008) 2:231–240 DOI 10.1007/s11569-008-0041-z&lt;/ref&gt; Doubts over the TGA's decision were raised with publication of a paper showing that the uncoated anatase form of TI02 used in some Australian sunscreens caused a photocatalytic reaction that degraded the surface of newly installed prepainted steel roofs in places where they came in contact with the sunscreen coated hands of workmen.&lt;ref&gt;Barker PJ and Branch A. The interaction of modern sunscreen formulations with surface coatings. Progress in Organic Coatings 2008; 62: 313-320&lt;/ref&gt; Such gaps in regulation are likely to continue alongside the development and commercialization of increasingly complex second and third generation nanotechnologies.

Nanomedicines are just beginning to enter drug regulatory processes, but within a few decades could comprise a dominant group within the class of innovative [[pharmaceuticals]], the current thinking of government safety and [[cost-effectiveness]] regulators appearing to be that these products give rise to few if any nano-specific issues.&lt;ref&gt;Vines T and Faunce TA Assessing the safety and cost-effectiveness of early nanodrugs Journal of Law and Medicine 2007; 16: 822-845&lt;/ref&gt; Some academics (such as [[Thomas Alured Faunce]]) have challenged that proposition and suggest that nanomedicines may create unique or heightened policy challenges for government systems of cost-effectiveness as well as safety regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA Policy challenges of nanomedicine for Australia’s PBS. Australian Health Review 2009; 33 (2): 258-267&lt;/ref&gt; There are also significant [[public good]] aspects to the regulation of nanotechnology, particularly with regard to ensuring that industry involvement in standard-setting does not become a means of reducing competition and that nanotechnology policy and regulation encourages new models of safe drug discovery and development more systematically targeted at the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA Toxicological and public good considerations for the regulation of nanomaterial-containing

[[Industry self-regulation|Self-regulation]] attempts may well fail, due to the inherent [[conflict of interest]] in asking any organization to police itself. If the public becomes aware of this failure, an external, independent organization is often given the duty of policing them, sometimes with highly punitive measures taken against the organization.
The Food and Drug Administration notes that it only regulates on the basis of voluntary claims made by the product manufacturer. If no claims are made by a manufacturer, then the FDA may be unaware of nanotechnology being employed.&lt;ref name="FDA"/&gt;

Yet regulations worldwide still fail to distinguish between materials in their nanoscale and bulk form. This means that nanomaterials remain effectively unregulated; there is no regulatory requirement for nanomaterials to face new health and safety testing or environmental impact assessment prior to their use in commercial products, if these materials have already been approved in bulk form. The health risks of nanomaterials are of particular concern for workers who may face [[Occupational safety and health|occupational exposure]] to nanomaterials at higher levels, and on a more routine basis, than the general public.

=== International law===

There is no international regulation of nanoproducts or the underlying nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite journal |title= FDA and Nanotechnology Products: Frequently asked questions |publisher= Food and Drug Administration |url= http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/Nanotechnology/FrequentlyAskedQuestions/ |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor are there any internationally agreed definitions or terminology for nanotechnology, no internationally agreed protocols for toxicity testing of nanoparticles, and no standardized protocols for evaluating the environmental impacts of nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=International Standardisation for Nanotechnologies |publisher=Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards |url=http://www.ifas.msu.edu/keyprojects.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706163117/http://ifas.msu.edu/keyprojects.htm |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since products that are produced using nanotechnologies will likely enter international trade, it is argued that it will be necessary to harmonize nanotechnology standards across national borders. There is concern that some countries, most notably developing countries, will be excluded from international standards negotiations. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20080706163117/http://ifas.msu.edu/keyprojects.htm Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards] notes that “developing countries should have a say in international nanotechnology standards development, even if they lack capacity to enforce the standards". (p.&amp;nbsp;14).&lt;ref name="Issues"&gt;{{cite journal |title= An Issues Landscape for Nanotechnology Standards. Report of a Workshop | publisher=Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards, Michigan State University, East Lansing |year=2007}} {{cite web |url=http://ifas.msu.edu/NSWorkshopReport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511171215/http://ifas.msu.edu/NSWorkshopReport.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about monopolies and concentrated control and ownership of new nanotechnologies were raised in community workshops in Australia in 2004.&lt;ref name="Australia" /&gt;

==Arguments against regulation==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Wide use of the term nanotechnology in recent years has created the impression that regulatory frameworks are suddenly having to contend with entirely new challenges that they are unequipped to deal with.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Many regulatory systems around the world already assess new substances or products for safety on a case by case basis, before they are permitted on the market. These regulatory systems have been assessing the safety of nanometre scale molecular arrangements for many years and many substances comprising nanometre scale particles have been in use for decades e.g. [[Carbon black]], [[Titanium dioxide]], [[Zinc oxide]], [[Bentonite]], [[Aluminum silicate]], [[Iron oxide]]s, [[Silicon dioxide]], [[Diatomaceous earth]], [[Kaolin]], [[Talc]], [[Montmorillonite]], [[Magnesium oxide]], [[Copper sulphate]].

These existing approval frameworks almost universally use the best available science to assess safety and do not approve substances or products with an unacceptable risk benefit profile. One proposal is to simply treat particle size as one of the several parameters defining a substance to be approved, rather than creating special rules for all particles of a given size regardless of type. A major argument against special regulation of nanotechnology is that the [[List of nanotechnology applications|projected applications]] with the greatest impact are [[Future studies|far in the future]], and it is unclear how to regulate technologies whose feasibility is speculative at this point. In the meantime, it has been argued that the immediate applications of [[nanomaterials]] raise challenges not much different from those of introducing any other new material, and can be dealt with by minor tweaks to existing regulatory schemes rather than sweeping regulation of entire scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Rollins, Nanobiotechnology Regulation: A Proposal for Self-Regulation with Limited Oversight, 6 NANOTECHNOLOGY L. &amp; BUS. 221, 221 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

A truly precautionary approach to regulation could severely impede development in the field of nanotechnology safety studies are required for each and every nanoscience application. While the outcome of these studies can form the basis for government and international regulations, a more reasonable approach might be development of a [[risk matrix]] that identifies likely culprits.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Response from governments ==
=== United Kingdom ===

In its seminal 2004 report ''Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies: Opportunities and Uncertainties'', the United Kingdom's Royal Society concluded that:

:''Many nanotechnologies pose no new risks to health and almost all the concerns relate to the potential impacts of deliberately manufactured nanoparticles and nanotubes that are free rather than fixed to or within a material... We expect the likelihood of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released from products in which they have been fixed or embedded (such as composites) to be low but have recommended that manufacturers assess this potential exposure risk for the lifecycle of the product and make their findings available to the relevant regulatory bodies... It is very unlikely that new manufactured nanoparticles could be introduced into humans in doses sufficient to cause the health effects that have been associated with [normal air pollution].''

but have recommended that nanomaterials be regulated as new chemicals, that research laboratories and factories treat nanomaterials "as if they were [[Hazardous material|hazardous]]", that release of nanomaterials into the environment be avoided as far as possible, and that products containing nanomaterials be subject to new safety testing requirements prior to their commercial release.&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;

The 2004 report by the UK Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineers&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt; noted that existing UK regulations did not require additional testing when existing substances were produced in nanoparticulate form. The Royal Society recommended that such regulations were revised so that “chemicals produced in the form of nanoparticles and nanotubes be treated as new chemicals under these regulatory frameworks” (p.xi). They also recommended that existing regulation be modified on a precautionary basis because they expect that “the toxicity of chemicals in the form of free nanoparticles and nanotubes cannot be predicted from their toxicity in a larger form and... in some cases they will be more toxic than the same mass of the same chemical in larger form.”&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;

The [[Better Regulation Commission]]'s earlier 2003 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scientific Research: Innovation with Controls |publisher= Better Regulation Task Force |url=http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/brc/upload/assets/www.brc.gov.uk/scientificresearch.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; had recommended that the UK Government:
# enable, through an informed debate, the public to consider the risks for themselves, and help them to make their own decisions by providing suitable information;
# be open about how it makes decisions, and acknowledge where there are uncertainties;
# communicate with, and involve as far as possible, the public in the decision making process;
# ensure it develops two-way communication channels; and
# take a strong lead over the handling of any risk issues, particularly information provision and policy implementation.

These recommendations were accepted in principle by the UK Government. Noting that there was “no obvious focus for an informed public debate of the type suggested by the Task Force”, the UK government's [http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/brc/upload/assets/www.brc.gov.uk/scienceresponse.pdf response] was to accept the recommendations.

The Royal Society's 2004 report&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt; identified two distinct governance issues:
# the “role and behaviour of institutions” and their ability to “minimise unintended consequences” through adequate regulation and
# the extent to which the public can trust and play a role in determining the trajectories that nanotechnologies may follow as they develop.

=== United States ===

Rather than adopt a new nano-specific regulatory framework, the United States' [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) convenes an 'interest group' each quarter with representatives of FDA centers that have responsibility for assessment and regulation of different substances and products. This interest group ensures coordination and communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Task Force Report |publisher= FDA Nanotechnology Task Force |url=http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/Nanotechnology/NanotechnologyTaskForceReport2007/default.htm |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 2009 FDA document called for identifying sources of nanomaterials, how they move in the environment, the problems they might cause for people, animals and plants, and how these problems could be avoided or mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Small concerns: nanotech regulations and risk management |publisher= SPIE Newsroom |url=http://spie.org/x38158.xml |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bush administration in 2007 decided that no special regulations or labeling of nanoparticles were required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/43305/story.htm|title=Positive Environment News|first=Planet Ark Environmental|last=Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics derided this as treating consumers like a "guinea pig"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icta.org/press/release.cfm?news_id=26 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107065131/http://www.icta.org/press/release.cfm?news_id=26 |archivedate=2007-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; without sufficient notice due to lack of labelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerscouncil.com/index.cfm?pid=14903|title=Consumers Council of Canada - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/News/2008/04/07/NanoParticles/|title=Big Worries About Micro Particles - The Tyee|first=Jude|last=Isabella|date=7 April 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Berkeley, CA]] is currently{{as of?|date=May 2012}} the only city in the United States to regulate nanotechnology.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Cambridge, MA]] in 2008 considered enacting a similar law, but the committee it instituted to study the issue Cambridge recommended against regulation in its final report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanolawreport.com/Cambridge.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; recommending instead other steps to facilitate information-gathering about potential effects of nanomaterials.

On December 10, 2008 the [[U.S. National Research Council]] released a report calling for more regulation of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States National Research Council]]. (2008).

====California====

Assembly Bill (AB) 289 (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/upload/AB_289_Bill_Language.pdf|title=Assembly Bill (AB) 289 (2006)|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) within the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]] and other agencies to request information on environmental and health impacts from chemical manufacturers and importers, including testing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chemical Information Call-In web page |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/Chemical_Call_In.cfm|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===

In October 2008, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), within the [http://www.calepa.ca.gov/ California Environmental Protection Agency], announced its intent to request information regarding analytical test methods, fate and transport in the environment, and other relevant information from manufacturers of carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nanotechnology web page |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/index.cfm|year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DTSC is exercising its authority under the California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chemical Information Call-In web page |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/Chemical_Call_In.cfm|year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These sections were added as a result of the adoption of [http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/pollutionprevention/chemical_call_in.cfm Assembly Bill AB 289 (2006)]. They are intended to make information on the fate and transport, detection and analysis, and other information on chemicals more available. The law places the responsibility to provide this information to the Department on those who manufacture or import the chemicals.

On January 22, 2009, a [http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/upload/Formal_AB289_Call_In_Letter_CNTs.pdf formal information request letter] was sent to [http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/upload/AB289_CNT_Contact_List.pdf manufacturers who produce or import carbon nanotubes in California, or who may export carbon nanotubes into the State]. This letter constitutes the first formal implementation of the authorities placed into statute by AB 289 and is directed to manufacturers of carbon nanotubes, both industry and academia within the State, and to manufacturers outside California who export carbon nanotubes to California. This request for information must be met by the manufacturers within one year. DTSC is waiting for the upcoming January 22, 2010 deadline for responses to the data call-in.

The California Nano Industry Network and DTSC hosted a full-day symposium on November 16, 2009 in Sacramento, CA. This symposium provided an opportunity to hear from nanotechnology industry experts and discuss future regulatory considerations in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Archived DTSC Nanotechnology Symposia |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/ArchivedSymposium.cfm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DTSC is expanding the Specific Chemical Information Call-in to members of the nanometal oxides. Interested individuals are encouraged to visit their website for the latest up-to-date information at http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/index.cfm.

On December 21, 2010, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) initiated the second Chemical Information Call-in for six nanomaterials: nano cerium oxide, nano silver, nano titanium dioxide, nano zero valent iron, nano zinc oxide, and quantum dots. DTSC sent a formal information request letter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/upload/Round_Two_Call-in_Letter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; to forty manufacturers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/upload/Round_Two_List_of_Letters_Sent.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; who produce or import the six nanomaterials in California, or who may export them into the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nanotechnology web page |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/nanometalcallin.cfm|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chemical Information Call-in is meant to identify information gaps of these six nanomaterials and to develop further knowledge of their analytical test methods, fate and transport in the environment, and other relevant information under California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020. DTSC completed the carbon nanotube information call-in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/CNTcallin.cfm|title=CommonSpot Error|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in June 2010.

DTSC partners with University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Santa Barbara (UCSB), and Riverside (UCR), University of Southern California (USC), Stanford University, Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (CEIN), and The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) on safe nanomaterial handling practices.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

DTSC is interested in expanding the Chemical Information Call-in to members of the bominated flame retardants, members of the methyl siloxanes, ocean plastics, nano-clay, and other emerging chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/Chemical_Call_In.cfm|title=Chemical Information Call-in Overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===

The European Union has formed a group to study the implications of nanotechnology called the [[Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions2/en/nanotechnologies/about-nanotechnologies.htm#7|title=The Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions2/en/nanotechnologies/index.htm#1|title=Public Health - European Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has published a list of risks associated with nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions2/en/nanotechnologies/l-2/6-health-effects-nanoparticles.htm#0 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306014519/http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions2/en/nanotechnologies/l-2/6-health-effects-nanoparticles.htm |date=2008-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, manufacturers and importers of carbon products, including carbon nano-tubes will have to submit full health and safety data within a year or so in order to comply with [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://echa.europa.eu/pre-registration_en.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508014507/http://echa.europa.eu/pre-registration_en.asp |archivedate=2009-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of European member states have called for the creation of either national or European nanomaterials registries. France, Belgium, Sweden, and Denmark have established national registries of nanomaterials. In Addition, the European Commission requested the [[European Chemicals Agency|Europeach Chemicals Agency (ECHA)]] to create a [https://euon.echa.europa.eu/ European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON)] that aims at collecting publically available information on the safety and markets of nanomaterials and nanotechnology. 

== Response from advocacy groups ==

In January 2008, a coalition of over 40 civil society groups endorsed a statement of principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Principles for the Oversight of Nanotechnologies and Nano-materials |publisher=International Center for Technology Assessment |year=2008 |url=http://www.icta.org/global/actions.cfm?page=15&amp;type=366&amp;topic=8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831042620/http://www.icta.org/global/actions.cfm?page=15&amp;type=366&amp;topic=8 |archivedate=2010-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; calling for precautionary action related to nanotechnology. The coalition called for strong, comprehensive oversight of the new technology and its products in the [[International Center for Technology Assessment]]'s report ''Principles for the Oversight of Nanotechnologies and Nano materials'',&lt;ref name="JulyCTA07release"&gt;{{cite press release| title = Broab international coalition issues urgent call for strong oversight of nanotechnology| publisher = International Center for Technology Assessment| date = 2007-07-31| url = http://www.icta.org/press/release.cfm?news_id=26| accessdate = 2007-10-19| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107065131/http://www.icta.org/press/release.cfm?news_id=26| archivedate = 2007-11-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which states:

:''Hundreds of consumer products incorporating nano-materials are now on the market, including cosmetics, sunscreens, sporting goods, clothing, electronics, baby and infant products, and food and food packaging. But evidence indicates that current nano-materials may pose significant health, safety, and environmental hazards. In addition, the profound social, economic, and ethical challenges posed by nano-scale technologies have yet to be addressed ... 'Since there is currently no government oversight and no labeling requirements for nano-products anywhere in the world, no one knows when they are exposed to potential nano-tech risks and no one is monitoring for potential health or environmental harm. That's why we believe oversight action based on our principles is urgent' ... This industrial boom is creating a growing nano-workforce which is predicted to reach two million globally by 2015. 'Even though potential health hazards stemming from exposure have been clearly identified, there are no mandatory workplace measures that require exposures to be assessed, workers to be trained, or control measures to be implemented,' explained Bill Kojola of the AFL-CIO. 'This technology should not be rushed to market until these failings are corrected and workers assured of their safety'"''&lt;ref name="JulyCTA07release"/&gt; also [https://web.archive.org/web/20100317234824/http://icta.org/nanotech/index.cfm].

The group has urged action based on eight principles. They are (1) A Precautionary Foundation (2) Mandatory Nano-specific Regulations (3) Health and Safety of the Public and Workers (4) Environmental Protection (5) Transparency (6) Public Participation (7) Inclusion of Broader Impacts and (8) Manufacturer Liability.

Some NGOs, including [https://web.archive.org/web/20100303043550/http://www.foe.org.au/nano-tech Friends of the Earth], are calling for the formation of a separate nanotechnology specific regulatory framework for the regulation of nanotechnology. In Australia, Friends of the Earth propose the establishment of a Nanotechnology Regulatory Coordination Agency, overseen by a Foresight and Technology Assessment Board. The advantage of this arrangement is that it could ensure a centralized body of experts that are able to provide oversight across the range of nano-products and sectors. It is also argued&lt;ref name="Futures"/&gt; that a centralized regulatory approach would simplify the regulatory environment, thereby supporting industry innovation. A National Nanotechnology Regulator could coordinate existing regulations related to nanotechnology (including intellectual property, civil liberties, product safety, occupation health and safety, environmental and international law). Regulatory mechanisms could vary from "hard law at one extreme through licensing and codes of practice to 'soft' self-regulation and negotiation in order to influence behavior."&lt;ref name="Futures"/&gt; 
The formation of national nanotechnology regulatory bodies may also assist in establishing global regulatory frameworks.&lt;ref name="Futures"/&gt;

In early 2008, The UK's largest organic certifier, [http://www.soilassociation.org/ the Soil Association], announced that its organic standard would exclude nanotechnology, recognizing the associated human and environmental health and safety risks. Certified organic standards in Australia exclude engineered nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, John [http://orgprints.org/16786/1/16786.pdf Nanotechnology: No Free Lunch], Platter, 1(1) 8-17&lt;/ref&gt; It appears likely that other organic certifiers will also follow suit.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, John &amp; Lyons, Kristen (2008) , [http://orgprints.org/13569/01/13569.pdf Nanotechnology: The Next Challenge for Organics], Journal of Organic Systems, 3(1) 3-22&lt;/ref&gt; The Soil Association was also the first to declare organic standards free from genetic engineering.

==Technical aspects==
===Size===
Regulation of nanotechnology will require a definition of the size, in which particles and processes are recognized as operating at the nano-scale. The size-defining characteristic of nanotechnology is the subject of significant debate, and varies to include particles and materials in the scale of at least 100 to 300 nanometers (nm). [https://web.archive.org/web/20100303043550/http://www.foe.org.au/nano-tech Friends of the Earth Australia] recommend defining nano-particles up to 300&amp;nbsp;nanometers (nm) in size. They argue that "particles up to a few hundred nanometers in size share many of the novel biological behaviors of nano-particles, including novel toxicity risks", and that "nano-materials up to approximately 300&amp;nbsp;nm in size can be taken up by individual cells". The [http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/a71fa2b6e2b6d3e980256a6c004542b4/444ed4dee8649ee18025739c003d0a49!OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=2,nanotechnology UK Soil Association] define nanotechnology to include manufactured nano-particles where the mean particle size is 200&amp;nbsp;nm or smaller. The [http://www.nano.gov U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative] defines nanotechnology as “the understanding and control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1 to 100&amp;nbsp;nm.

===Mass thresholds===
Regulatory frameworks for chemicals tend to be triggered by mass thresholds.&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt; This is certainly the case for the management of toxic chemicals in Australia through the [[National pollutant inventory]]. However, in the case of nanotechnology, nano-particle applications are unlikely to exceed these thresholds (tonnes/kilograms) due to the size and weight of nano-particles. As such, the [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.item&amp;news_id=165552 Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars] questions the usefulness of regulating nanotechnologies on the basis of their size/weight alone. They argue, for example, that the toxicity of nano-participles is more related to surface area than weight, and that emerging regulations should also take account of such factors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2721">'''Reinhold Trautmann''' (16 January 1883 &amp;ndash; 4 October 1951) was a [[Germans|German]] [[Slavist]]. He is best known for his translations of the works of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] literature, such as his 1931 translation of the [[Primary Chronicle]] into [[German language|German]]. He also conducted research of Slavic languages spoken in Germany.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Königsberg]]. Since 1910 he worked at the Universities in [[Charles University in Prague|Prague]], [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]], [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]] and (since 1948) [[University of Jena|Jena]]. He became known for his work on [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] philology and [[Slavic folk poetry]]. In 1928-1931 he was a member of the German Democratic Party (since 1930 German State Party).&lt;ref&gt;Harry Waibel: ''Diener vieler Herren : Ehemalige NS-Funktionäre in der SBZ/DDR.''

'''Roger Vitrac'''  ({{IPA-fr|vitʁak|lang}}; 17 November 1899 – 22 January 1952) was a French [[Surrealism|surrealist]] playwright and poet.

==Biography==
Born in [[Pinsac]], Roger Vitrac moved to Paris in 1910. As a young man, he was influenced by [[Symbolist poetry|symbolism]] and the writings of [[Lautréamont]] and [[Alfred Jarry]], and he developed a passion for theatre and poetry. A year after his ''baccalauréat'', he published a collection of poems, ''Le Faune noir''.

During his three-year-long military service, he met [[Marcel Arland]], [[François Baron]], [[Georges Limbour]] and [[René Crevel]], who together founded the literary revue, ''[[Aventure]]''. Through the group, Vitrac met [[André Breton]] and [[Louis Aragon]] at [[Café Certa]] in 1921, where many [[Dada]] activities took place until it became one of the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] group's headquarters. In the early twenties, Vitrac joined the surrealist movement and contributed to the first few editions of ''[[La Révolution Surréaliste]]''. Slowly segregated from the group along with [[Antonin Artaud]], together they created the [[Théatre Alfred-Jarry]] in 1926, where they produced some of their most important plays such as ''The Mysteries of Love'' (''Les Mystères de l'amour'', 1927) and ''Victor, or Power to the Children'' (''Victor ou les enfants au pouvoir'', 1928), setting the tone for the [[Theatre of the Absurd]], twenty years before [[Ionesco]]. ''The Cambridge Guide to Theatre'' describes ''The Mysteries of Love'' as a masterpiece of surrealist theatre. It is now considered a key play in 20th-century French theatre.

Vitrac joined [[Georges Bataille]] as one of the signatories of  ''[[Un Cadavre]]'' against [[André Breton|Breton]] and contributed to ''[[Documents]]'' with articles on "[[Gaston-Louis Roux]]" (1929, issue 7), "The Abduction of the Sabines" (1930, issue 6) and a poem, "Humorage to Picasso" (1930, issue 3), dedicated to the artist. From 1931, he worked as a journalist while further exploring burlesque style playwriting, which often operated between [[boulevard comedy]] and intimate tragedy. His multi-thematic ''Coup de Trafalgar'' (1934) and ''Les Demoiselles du large'' (1938) gained as little recognition as his more slapstick plays such as ''Le Loup-Garou'' (1939) and ''[[Le Sabre de mon père]]'' (1951).

Vitrac died in Paris in 1952.

Only after his death did Vitrac reach popular stardom status with [[Jean Anouilh]]'s 1962 production of ''Victor, or Power to the Children''.

'''Rota Latte Stone Quarry''', also known as the As Nieves quarry, is located near the [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] village of [[Sinapalo]], on the island of [[Rota (island)|Rota]] in the [[Marianas|Marianas Archipelago]]. The prehistoric megaliths found there are believed to have been used as foundation pillars for houses, with some of them weighing up to 35 tons. Their exact age, origin, methods of quarrying and means of transportation have not been determined.

==Latte stones==
A [[latte stone]] pillar (also called a taga stone)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wuerch|first=William L|title=Historical Dictionary of Guam and Micronesia|year=1994|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8108-2858-2|author2=Ballendorf, Dirk Anthony |authorlink2=Dirk Ballendorf |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a two-piece structure consisting of a base (haligi) and hemispherical cap (tasa), with the flat side turned upwards. It is believed that the prehistoric latte stone pillars were used as housing foundations for the indigenous culture of the Marianas. The homes sat on top of two parallel rows of the pillars, and the [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]], or their ancestors, buried their dead between the rows.&lt;ref name="Ancient"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Lawrence J|title=Ancient Chamorro Society|year=1997|publisher=Bess Pr Inc|isbn=978-1-880188-05-7|pages=47–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stones pre-date any retained oral history of the Chamorro, who cite the original source of the stones as the "taotaomona" (before time people). The exact age of the stones has not been determined, but some are believed to date back to at least 845 [[AD]]. Carbon dating places the indigenous population as far back as 3,000 [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="Nan Mandol"&gt;{{cite book|last=Childress|first=David Hatcher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35fzwB10ACsC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22rota+latte+stone+quarry%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RcONTamKIoKqsAPsmNHzCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Ancient Micronesia &amp; the Lost City of Nan Madol: Including Palau, Yap, Kosrae, Chuuk &amp; the Marianas|year=1998|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|isbn=978-0-932813-49-7|pages=120–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The quarry==
The Rota quarry is the site of the largest unearthed latte stones in the Marianas.&lt;ref name="Nan Mandol"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flood| first=Bo| title=Marianas Island Legends Myth and Magic|year=2001|publisher=Bess Press|isbn=978-1-57306-102-5|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine haligi and seven tasa have been found there.&lt;ref name="Archaeology"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=David|title=South Pacific Handbook: With Galapagos Support|year=1982|publisher=TBS The Book Service Ltd|isbn=978-0-9603322-3-6|page=498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the abandoned [[megalith]]s would stand approximately {{convert|25|ft|m}} high if the haligi had been topped with tasa and erected upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Robert F|title=Destiny's Landfall: A History of Guam|year=1995|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1678-0|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tasa at the quarry measure approximately {{convert|7|ft|m}} across and {{convert|5|ft|m}} high. The stones are unfinished, and there is no record or indication of why the site was suddenly abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flood|first=Bo and William|title=Micronesian Legends|year=2002|publisher=Bess Press|isbn=978-1-57306-129-2|author2=Strong, Beret E |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Taga Latte Stone Quarry, Rota.jpg|thumb|right|The latte quarry on [[Rota (island)|Rota]] has several partially cut stones]]

==Theories==
Theories have been put forward regarding the methods of quarrying, transporting and erecting the latte stones, but nothing has been scientifically proven.&lt;ref name="Ancient"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanauer|first=Eric|title=Diving Micronesia|year=2001|publisher=Aqua Quest Publications, Inc.|isbn=978-1-881652-19-9|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When upright, the megaliths from Rota Latte Stone Quarry would be per 0.5 m taller than the tallest existing latte stones at the [[House of Taga]] in [[Tinian]] Island. This might be indicative of competition between different groups, striving to build the most impressive sets of latte stones.&lt;ref name=wondermondo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Au/NorthernMarianas/Rota/RotaLatteQuarry.htm|title=Rota Latte Stones Quarry (As Nieves Quarry)|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legend credits the origin of the quarry to a [[mythological]] chief named Taga, who quarried the stones at Rota before abandoning the site and later erecting the [[House of Taga]] on [[Tinian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Acosta|first=Therese F|title=Micronesian Legends|year=2002|publisher=Bess Press|isbn=978-1-57306-129-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVVQ46epBqwC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22chief+taga%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=z2WOTdLRJ4G-sQOJrviHCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chief%20taga%22&amp;f=false |chapter=The Story of Taga|pages=12–17|author2=Flood, Bo and William |author3=Strong, Beret E }}&lt;/ref&gt; A different legend tells of ghosts carrying the stones.&lt;ref name="Archaeology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rainbird|first=Paul|title=The Archaeology of Micronesia|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65630-6|pages=117, 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Nordic Society of Antiquaries''' ({{lang-da|'''Det Kongelige Nordiske Oldskriftselskab'''}}; {{lang-is|'''Hið konunglega norræna fornfræðafélag'''}}) was founded in Denmark on 28 January 1825 by among others [[Carl Christian Rafn]] and [[Rasmus Rask]]. The company's aim is to promote Norse literature, history and archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldskriftselskabet.dk/&lt;/ref&gt; The society was first royal on 9 May 1828.

The company publishes ''Aarbøger for nordisk Oldkyndighed og Historie'' and has also published works by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, ''Ledetraad Nordic Oldkyndighed'' (1836), Carl Christian Rafn, ''Antiquitates Americanae'' (1837), ''konung skuggsjá (Kongespeilet)'' in Danish translation by Finnur Jónsson (1926) and his ''Lexicon poeticum antiquæ linguæ septentrionalis: Ordbog over det norsk-islandske Skjaldesprog'' (2nd edition 1931), and the series Nordiske Fortidsminder.

The '''''Seder HaDorot''''' or "Book of Generations" (completed 1725, published 1768) by Lithuanian Rabbi [[Jehiel Heilprin]] (1660&amp;ndash;1746) is a [[Hebrew]]-language chronological work that serves as a depot of multiple Hebrew language chronological books and manuscripts. The work presents all given dates in the [[Hebrew Calendar]] format.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Jewish Literature: The German-Polish cultural center  p152 Israel Zinberg - 1975 "But such works were of little interest to Heilprin's generation, which was absorbed in pilpul, and ''Seder HaDorot'', which was completed in 1725, was first published in 1768 when Heilprin had already long been in his grave."&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, Heilprin analyzed alternating and sometimes conflicting dates to produce a final decision and/or at times presents two plausible dates for a given event.

==Composition==
This work consists of three independent volumes or parts:
* The first of these, entitled ''Yemot 'Olam,'' is a history from the Creation down to his own time. The author always endeavors to give, by means of calculation, the dates of [[Biblical]] personages. He bases his work on the ''Yuḥasin'' of [[Abraham Zacuto]], on the ''Shalshelet HaKabbalah'' of [[Gedaliah ibn Yaḥya]], and on the ''Ẓemaḥ Dawid'' of [[David Gans]]. It seems that this first part was written when the author was still young, for the last event which he registered was one occurring in 1697.
* The second part, ''Seder HaTanna'im WehaAmora'im,'' contains lists of the [[Tannaim]] and [[Amoraim]] in alphabetical order with their dates.
* The third part is a kind of catalogue containing first the names of all the authors, then those of their works, both arranged in alphabetical order. Heilprin based this part on the ''Sifte Yeshenim'' of [[Shabbethai Bass]], but added a great number of other titles. He states in the preface the many advantages of a knowledge of the chronological order of the [[Talmudists]], which indeed in certain cases is absolutely necessary.

The whole work is followed by notes on the Talmud, also arranged in alphabetical order. It was published for the first time by Heilprin's grandson, [[Judah Löb Heilprin]], at [[Karlsruhe]] in 1769. There exist several other editions, the latest being the revised one of [[Naphtali Maskileison]], son of [[Abraham Maskileison]] Warsaw, 1882.

Of Heilprin's numerous other works mentioned in the ''Seder HaDorot,'' the only one which has been published is ''Erke HaKinnuyim,'' a dictionary of synonyms and homonyms occurring in the [[Bible]], [[Talmud]], and other works, chiefly cabalistic (Dyhernfurth, 1806).

==Biography==

===Education===
Der Nersessian was born the youngest of three children in [[Constantinople]] in 1896. She came from a well-to-do family and her maternal uncle happened to be the [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Malachia Ormanian]].&lt;ref name=DumbartonOaks/&gt; Her parents died while she was still young: her mother Akabi, when she was nine, and her father Mihran, when she was eighteen.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|contribution=Sirarpie Der Nersessian|url=http://arthistorians.info/dernersessians|publisher=[[Dictionary of Art Historians]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from Yesayan Parochial School and the English High School in Constantinople, gaining fluency in Armenian, English and French at an early age. In 1915, during the height of the [[Armenian Genocide]], Der Nersessian and her sister Arax (by then orphans) were forced to leave for Europe, where they took up residence in [[Geneva]]. Der Nersessian studied at the [[University of Geneva]] for several years until settling in [[Paris, France]] in 1919.&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{cite book|language=hy|authorlink=Levon Chookaszian|last=Chookaszian|first=Levon|contribution=Տեր-Ներսեսյան, Սիրարփի Միհրան [Ter Nersesyan, Sirarpi Mihrani]|title=[[Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]]|volume=11|location=Yerevan|publisher=Armenian Encyclopedia|year=1985|p=683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Der Nersessian was admitted to [[Sorbonne University]], studying history at the École des Hautes Études de l'université de Paris. She studied under the notable [[Byzantine studies|Byzantinologist]]s [[Charles Diehl]] and [[Gabriel Millet]] and art historian [[Henri Focillon]].&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; In 1922, she became Millet's assistant, and with his help, published one of her first articles in 1929.&lt;ref name=DumbartonOaks/&gt; The two theses (graduates students then had to submit two theses) that she presented for her ''doctorat d'etat'', "L'illustration du roman de Barlaam et Joasaph" and a paper on Armenian illuminated manuscripts during the late medieval period,&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; were well-received (earning a ''Mention très honorable''), and both of them were awarded with prizes by the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] and ''Revue des Études Grecques'' when they were published in 1937.

===Professor and pioneer===
In 1930, Der Nersessian moved to the [[United States]] at the suggestion of her three mentors, Byzantinists [[Charles Rufus Morey]], Albert M. Friend Jr., and Walter Cook, becoming a part-time lecturer at [[Wellesley College]] in [[Massachusetts]]. She taught art history at Wellesley, quickly gaining a full professorship and later becoming the chairwoman of the Department of Art History and Director of Farnsworth Museum.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; Der Nersessian was the first woman to teach Byzantine art at a woman’s college, the first woman to be decorated with the medal of Saint Gregory the Illuminator by His Holiness Catholicos [[Vazgen I]] in 1960, the first woman invited to lecture at the Collège de France in Paris, the only woman in her time to gain full professorship at Dumbarton Oaks, and the second woman to be honored with a gold medal from the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Kouymjian. "Sirarpie Der Nersessian", pp. 482-493.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, she received the Achievement Award from the [[American Association of University Women]].

Der Nersessian remained at Dumbarton Oaks until 1978, when she retired to France and lived with her sister in Paris.&lt;ref name=DumbartonOaks/&gt; Upon retirement, she had her entire library shipped to the [[Matenadaran]] in [[Yerevan]], so as to better help Armenian scholars in their studies. Shortly after her death in 1989, an endowment fund for prospective art history students in Armenia, Fonds Sirarpie Der Neressian at the Institut de Recherches sur les Miniatures Arméno-Byzantines, was created in her honor.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

==Bibliography==
Der Nersessian's work primarily concerned Armenian art history, including the study of  [[church architecture]], [[illuminated manuscripts]], [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and [[sculpture]]. Below is a partial list of books and articles that she authored.&lt;ref&gt;For a more comprehensive list, see: Dumbarton Oaks Papers. "Sirarpie Der Nersessian." ''Dumbarton Oaks''. Vol. 21, 1967, pp. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1945 book, ''Armenia and the Byzantine Empire'', was praised by art historians [[David Talbot Rice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Armenia and the Byzantine Empire by Sirapie der Nercessian Review by: [[David Talbot Rice]]|journal=[[The English Historical Review]]|volume=61|issue=240|date=May 1946|pp=271–272|doi=10.1093/ehr/LXI.CCLX.271-b |publisher=Oxford University Press|quote=Miss Nercessian's factual treatment is again welcome in a field where narrow partisanship has often tended to obscure the issues.

'''Elseus Sophus Bugge''' (5 January 1833 – 8 July 1907) was a  noted [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[philologist]]  and linguist. His scholarly work was directed to the study of runic inscriptions and Norse philology.  Bugge is best known for his theories and his work on the [[runic alphabet]] and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and ''[[Prose Edda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Sophus_Bugge/utdypning ''Sophus Bugge – utdypning'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Elseus Sophus Bugge was born in [[Larvik]], in [[Vestfold]] county, [[Norway]]. His ancestors had been merchants, ship owners and captains of the Larvik for several generations. Bugge was a [[cand.mag.]] (1857) and research fellow in comparative linguistics and [[Sanskrit]] (1860). He was educated in [[Oslo|Christiania]], [[Copenhagen]] and [[Berlin]].

==Career==
In 1866 he became professor of comparative philology, comparative Indo-European linguistics and [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] at [[Christiania University]] now the University of Oslo. In addition to collecting Norwegian [[folksong]]s and traditions and writing on [[Runic]] inscriptions, he made considerable contributions to the study of the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Oscan language|Oscan]], [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] and [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] languages. His scientific work was of fundamental importance for the Norse philology and runic research.

In his 1880 work ''Studies about the origin of Nordic mythological and heroic tales'', Bugge theorized that nearly all myths in [[Old Norse]] literature derive from [[Christianity|Christian]] and late [[classical antiquity|classical]] concepts. Bugge's theories were generally vehemently rejected, but have had some influence.

Bugge was the author of a very large number of books on philology and [[folklore]]. His principal work, a critical edition of the [[Poetic Edda]] (''Norrœn Fornkvæði''), was published at Christiania in 1867. He maintained that the Eddic poems and the earlier sagas were largely founded on Christian and Latin tradition imported into [[Scandinavian literature]] by way of [[England]]. His writings also include ''Gamle Norske Folkeviser'' (1858), a collection of Old Norse folk-songs; ''Bidrag til den ældste skaldedigtnings historie'' (Christiania, 1894); ''Helge-digtene i den Ældre Edda'' (Copenhagen, 1896, Eng. trans., ''The Home of the Eddic Poems'', 1899); ''Norsk Sagafortælling og Sagaskrivning i Island'' (Christiania, 1901), and various books on runic inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Sophus_Bugge ''Sophus Bugge'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating from 1902, Bugge's vision was so poor that he could no longer read.  Professor and  linguist [[Magnus Olsen]], who was Bugge's assistant and his successor, would  read and describe  new discoveries of inscriptions. Bugge's final works regarding original rune scripture were not completed before he died.  They were released between 1910 and 1913 through the efforts of Professor Olsen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Magnus_Olsen/utdypning ''Magnus Olsen'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Bugge was a member of the Scientific Society of Christiania (now The [[Norwegian Academy of Science]]) from 1858 (vice president 1884), The Royal Norwegian Scientific Society in [[Trondheim]] (1865) and a number of foreign societies. He was made honorary doctor at [[Uppsala University]] in 1877. He was appointed a Knight of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] in 1877, Commander Grand Cross 1890 and 1896.

==Personal life==
Bugge was married during 1869 to Karen Sophie Schreiner (1835–1897). His son [[Alexander Bugge]] became a noted historian.

'''The Elstree Project''' is an [[oral history]] project which began in 2010. The project is conducted in partnership by the [[University of Hertfordshire]] and Elstree Screen Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making movie history in Borehamwood and Elstree|url=http://www.hertsmere.gov.uk/News/Articles/July/Making-movie-history-in-Borehamwood-and-Elstree.aspx|work=Hertsmere|publisher=Hertsmere Borough Council|accessdate=2 February 2014|date=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is endorsed by the [[BECTU]] History Project&lt;ref name="UHSHIN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BECTU" /&gt; and [[Elstree Studios#Elstree Studios, Shenley Rd, Borehamwood|Elstree Studios]].&lt;ref name="UHSHIN" /&gt;

== Background ==

The Elstree Project interviews cast and crew members who have worked at any of the six main studios in Elstree and Borehamwood: [[Elstree Studios#Elstree Studios, Shenley Rd, Borehamwood|Elstree Studios]] (formerly [[Associated British Picture Corporation|ABPC]], later [[EMI Films|EMI]]), BBC Elstree Centre (formerly [[Associated Television#Studios|ATV]]), [[MGM-British Studios]], Danziger's New Elstree Studios, British and Dominion Studios and The Gate studios.

The project has interviewed crew members from various departments including continuity, sound, post-production, camera and lighting, props and scenery and construction.  Writers, producers and directors have also been interviewed, including [[Jan Harlan]], [[Roger Moore]],&lt;ref name="BWTprint" /&gt; [[Brian Blessed]],&lt;ref name="whtimes1" /&gt; [[Kenneth Cope]],&lt;ref name="whtimes1" /&gt; [[Walter Murch]],&lt;ref name="TEPUSA" /&gt; and [[Steven Spielberg]].&lt;ref name="TEPUSA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whtimes2" /&gt;

== Access ==

There is currently no method of public access to the complete archive of interviews. However, the project content has been gradually made available through excerpts and edited documentaries.  Content is also accessible in the Elstree and Borehamwood museum.&lt;ref name="BWT1" /&gt;

The project has hosted three seasons of screenings, showing either three films or two films and a double-bill of television episodes of productions made at the studios in Elstree and Borehamwood.  These have included ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980),&lt;ref name="whtimes3" /&gt; ''[[The Prisoner]]'' (TV 1967-68),&lt;ref name="watfordob" /&gt; ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'' (1980)&lt;ref name="whtimes1" /&gt; and ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)]]'' (TV 1969-70).&lt;ref name="whtimes1" /&gt;  Edited extracts from the interviews recorded have been made into documentaries which have been premiered before each screening.

The 17-minute-long documentary which preceded ''The Shining'', entitled ''Staircases to Nowhere: Making Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining''', gained attention from film blogs.&lt;ref name="openculture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="overlook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fandor.com/keyframe/daily-kubrick-lacma |title=DAILY Kubrick @ LACMA |accessdate=23 January 2013 |website=Fandor |date=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally containing interviews with five crew members from the film,&lt;ref name="UHSHIN" /&gt; it was expanded to fifty-five minutes with additional interviews with four more crew members and with Kubrick's widow [[Christiane Kubrick|Christiane]]. Project content has been used by researchers and authors, such as Kiri Waldon's book ''British Film Studios'',&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; as well as specially created for publication in published works such as the DVD release of ''Elstree Story''.&lt;ref name="network" /&gt;

A documentary, made from project interviews, was completed in October 2014.  ''From Borehamwood to Hollywood: The Rise and Fall and Rise of Elstree'', is a 100-minute-long film which tells the story of 100 years of filmmaking in the two towns.  The film is narrated by Barbara Windsor.&lt;ref name="BWT2" /&gt;

Bush became co-editor of the journal in 1906 and provided it with its endowment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The inaugural issue announced that the journal was founded with the intent of "covering the whole field of scientific philosophy, psychology, ethics and logic" so that "the relations between philosophy and psychology should remain intimate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = i308767|title = Notes and News|last = |first = |date = 7 January 1904|journal = The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods|doi = |pmid = |issue = Vol. 1, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 the name of the journal was shortened to ''The Journal of Philosophy.''

Willie was the son of sheep rancher Kels Nickell, who had been involved in a [[range war|range feud]] with neighbor and cattle rancher Jim Miller. On the day before his 43rd birthday, Horn was executed by [[hanging]] in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]].

While in jail he wrote his autobiography, ''Life of Tom Horn: Government Scout and Interpreter'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lUctmKI0lG0C ''Life of Tom Horn: Government Scout and Interpreter''] (1904).&lt;/ref&gt; which was published posthumously in 1904. Numerous editions have been published in the late 20th century. Horn has since become a larger-than-life figure of western folklore, and debate continues as to whether he was actually guilty of Nickell's murder.

==Early life==
Thomas Horn, Jr., known as "Tom", was born in 1860 to Thomas S. Horn, Sr. and Mary Ann Maricha ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Miller) on their family farm in rural northeastern [[Scotland County, Missouri|Scotland County]], [[Missouri]]. The family owned 600 acres bisected by the South Wyaconda River between the towns of [[Granger, Missouri|Granger]] and [[Etna, Missouri|Etna]]. Tom was the fifth of twelve children.&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Carlson|first=Chip|year=2001|title=Tom Horn: Blood on the Moon: Dark History of the Murderous Cattle Detective|publisher=High Plains Press|pages=22–28|isbn=978-0-931271-58-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his childhood, the young Tom suffered physical abuse from his father, and his only companion as a child was a dog named Shedrick. The dog was tragically killed when the young Tom got into a fight with two boys, who beat Tom and killed the dog with a shotgun.&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2014), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scout==
Horn allegedly killed his first man in a duel — a second lieutenant in the [[Mexican Army]], whom he killed as a result of a dispute with a prostitute.&lt;ref name="chroniclingamerica.loc.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2014), p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; At sixteen, Horn headed to the [[American Southwest]], where he was hired by the [[Cavalry (United States)|U.S. Cavalry]] as a civilian scout, [[Outfitter|packer]] and interpreter under [[Al Sieber]] during the [[Apache Wars]]. Horn did a great job in his work for the army, and soon rose through the ranks. In one instance, as the army was crossing Cibecue Creek, they were [[Battle of Cibecue Creek|ambushed by Apaches warriors]] positioned on high ground.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan (1997), p. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; The officer in charge of their squad, Captain Edmund Hentig, was instantly killed, and the men became pinned down under overwhelming fire. Desperate, Sieber ordered Horn and another scout, [[Mickey Free]], to break away and return fire from a hill. Together with the soldiers, the men managed to repel the attack. Horn and Sieber also participated in the [[Battle of Big Dry Wash]], and gained recognition when he and Lt. George H. Morgan slipped through the banks opposite the Apache line and provided covering fire for the cavalry, as well as killing a number of Apache warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2014), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horn was a respected scout by then, known for going out alone in reconnaissance missions as well as helping track down [[Geronimo]]'s major stronghold. By November 1885, Tom Horn earned the position of Chief of Scouts under Captain [[Emmet Crawford]] in [[Fort Bowie]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2014) p.54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rarewinchesters.com/articles/art_tomhorn.shtml|title=The Legend of Tom Horn |last=Prisbrey |first=Denis |publisher=''Rare Winchesters'' |date= |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During one operation, Horn's camp was mistakenly [[Crawford Affair|attacked]] by a Mexican militia, and he was wounded in the arm during the shootout, which also resulted in Crawford's death.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson.(2001) p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on September 4, 1886, Horn was present at Geronimo's final surrender and acted as an interpreter under [[Charles B. Gatewood]].&lt;ref name=runkle&gt;{{cite book|title=Wanted Dead Or Alive: Manhunts from Geronimo to Bin Laden|first=Benjamin|last= Runkle|pages=29–33|publisher =Macmillan |year= 2011 |ISBN =978-0-230-10485-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Horn used what he earned to build his own ranch in his return to [[Aravaipa Canyon]] in Arizona. His ranch consisted of 100 cattle and 26 horses, and he also laid claim in the Deer Creek Mining District near the canyon. Unfortunately, it was short-lived, as cattle thieves stormed his ranch one night and stole all his stock, leaving a tremendous loss and bankruptcy for Horn. This incident would mark Horn's hatred and disdain for thieves, which would lead to his entering the profession of range detective.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan (1997) Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2014) p.44-47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detective, lawman and gun for hire==
Horn wandered and took jobs as a [[Prospecting|prospector]], ranch hand and rodeo contestant, but he is most notorious for being hired by numerous cattle companies as a cowboy and hired gun to watch over their cattle and kill any suspected criminals preying on them. In his line of work, Horn developed his own means to fight [[cattle rustling]], which he described: "I would simply take the calf and such things as that stopped the stealing. I had more faith in getting the calf than in courts." If he thought a man was guilty of stealing cattle and had been fairly warned, Horn said that he would shoot the thief and would not feel "one shred of remorse."&lt;ref name="Psycho"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/tom-horn-misunderstood-misfit.htm|title=Tom Horn: Misunderstood Misfit |last=Carlson  |first= Chip |publisher=''Wild West Magazine'' |date=June 12, 2006  |accessdate=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Horn would often give a warning first to those he suspected of rustling, and was said to have been a "tremendous presence" whenever he was in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="Psycho"/&gt; Fergie Mitchell, a rancher on the [[North Laramie River]], described Horn's reputation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw him ride by. He didn't stop, but went straight on up the creek in plain sight of everyone. All he wanted was to be seen, as his reputation was so great that his presence in a community had the desired effect. Within a week three settlers in the neighborhood sold their holdings and moved out. That was the end of cattle rustling on the North Laramie.&lt;ref name="Psycho"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, Horn took part in the [[Pleasant Valley War]] between cattlemen and sheepmen in [[Arizona]]. Historians have not established which side he worked for, and both sides suffered several killings for which no known suspects were ever identified.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson.(2001) p.36&lt;/ref&gt; Horn worked on a ranch owned by Robert Bowen, where he became one of the prime suspects in the disappearance of Mart Blevins in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Dan L. Thrapp, ''Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography, Volume 1: A-F'' (1991); University of Nebraska Press, pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that throughout the war, he was the "mediator" of the conflict, serving as a deputy sheriff under three famous Arizona lawmen: [[Buckey O'Neill|William Owen "Buckey" O'Neill]], [[Commodore Perry Owens]], and [[Glenn Reynolds (sheriff)|Glenn Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Horn, ''Life of Tom Horn: Government Scout and Interpreter'' (1904); Doyce B. Nunis Jr., editor; Chicago: The Lakeside Press, R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company, 1987, pp. 317–318.&lt;/ref&gt; Horn also participated with Reynolds in a lynching of three suspected rustlers in August 1888. As a deputy sheriff, Horn drew the attention of the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]] due to his tracking abilities. Hired by the agency in late 1889 or early 1890, he handled investigations in the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[Colorado]] and [[Wyoming]] and in other western states, working out of the [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] office. He became known for his calm under pressure and his ability to track down anyone assigned to him.

In one case, Horn and another agent, C.W. Shores, captured two men who had robbed the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] on August 31, 1890 between [[Cotopaxi, Colorado|Cotopaxi]] and Texas Creek in [[Fremont County, Colorado]]. Horn and Shores tracked and arrested Thomas Eskridge (also known as "Peg-Leg" Watson) and Burt "Red" Curtis without firing a shot. They tracked them all the way to the home of a man named Wolfe, said to be in either [[Washita, Oklahoma|Washita]] or [[Pauls Valley, Oklahoma|Pauls Valley]], [[Oklahoma]], along the [[Washita River]]. In his report on that arrest, Horn stated in part "Watson, was considered by everyone in Colorado as a very desperate character. I had no trouble with him."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Anderson, Dan |author2=Laurence J. Yadon |last-author-amp=yes |year=2007 |title=100 Oklahoma Outlaws, Gangsters, and Lawmen: 1839-1939 |publisher=Pelican Publishing Company |page=231 |isbn=978-1-58980-384-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Johnson County War]], Horn worked for the [[Wyoming Stock Growers Association]] as well as for the Pinkertons, who had assigned him to work undercover in the county using the alias Tom Hale. He is alleged to have been involved in the killing of [[Nate Champion]] and Nick Ray on April 9, 1892, and was a prime suspect for the assassinations of ranchers John A. Tisdale and Orley "Ranger" Jones.&lt;ref name="chroniclingamerica.loc.gov"/&gt; The Pinkerton Agency forced Horn to resign in 1894. In his memoir, ''Two Evil Isms: Pinkertonism and Anarchism'', Pinkerton detective [[Charlie Siringo]] wrote that "William A. Pinkerton told me that Tom Horn was guilty of the crime, but that his people could not allow him to go to prison while in their employ." Siringo would later indicate that he respected Horn's abilities at tracking, and that he was a very talented agent, but had a wicked element.&lt;ref name="Tom Horn"&gt;[http://www.thrillingdetective.com/eyes/horn.html Tom Horn] at www.thrillingdetective.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thrillingdetective.com/eyes/siringo.html Charlie Siringo], Thrilling Detective website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, Horn reportedly killed a known cattle thief named William Lewis near [[Farthing, Wyoming|Iron Mountain, Wyoming]]. Horn was exonerated for that crime and for the 1895 murder of Fred Powell six weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tom-horn.com/story-fred-powell.htm "The Murder of Fred U. Powell"], Tom Horn website&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, a ranchman named Campbell, known to have a large stash of cash, was last seen with Horn.&lt;ref name="chroniclingamerica.loc.gov"/&gt; In 1896, Horn offered his service in a letter to the marshal of [[Tucson, Arizona]] in getting rid of William Christian's rustler gang. William was killed by an unknown assailant in 1897, and his associate Robert Christian disappeared the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Dan L. Thrapp, ''Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography, Volume 1: G-O'' (1991), University of Nebraska Press, pp. 676.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorado Range War===
[[File:Isom Dart.jpg|thumb|Ned Huddleston, alias Isom Dart. Brown's Hole, Wyoming, c. 1890s.]]
Although his official title was "Range Detective", Horn essentially served as a [[Contract killing|killer-for-hire]]. By the mid-1890s, the cattle business in [[Wyoming]] and [[Colorado]] was changing due to the arrival of [[homesteaders]] and new ranchers. The homesteaders, referred to as "nesters" or "grangers" by the big operators, had moved into the territory in large numbers. By doing so they decreased the availability of water for the herds of the larger cattle barons.&lt;ref name="Dart"&gt;Ball (2014) p.232-234&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, efforts were made to get rid of these homesteaders, including by hiring gunmen such as Tom Horn. Violent gunfights such as the bloody shootout that resulted in the death of nine trappers in [[Big Dry Creek (Littleton, Colorado)|Big Dry Creek]], as well as the lynching and burning of homesteaders Luther M. Mitchell and Ami W. Ketchum, precipitated the [[Colorado Range War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wyomingtalesandtrails.com/johnson.html|title=Johnson County War |publisher=''Wyoming Tails and Trails'' |date= |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, Horn began working for the Swan Land and Cattle Company in northwest Colorado. His first job was to investigate the Browns Park Cattle Association's leader, a cowboy named Matt Rash, who was suspected of cattle rustling.&lt;ref name="Dart"/&gt; Horn went undercover as "Tom Hicks" and worked for Rash as a ranch hand while also collecting evidence of Rash branding cattle that did not belong to him. When Horn finally pieced together enough evidence to determine that Rash was indeed a rustler, he put a letter on Rash's door threatening that he must leave in sixty days. Rash, however, defiantly stayed and continued working on his ranch. As Rash continued to be uncooperative, Horn's employers were said to have given him the "go-ahead signal" to execute Rash. On the day of the murder, an armed Horn allegedly arrived at Rash's cabin as the man had just finished eating and shot him at point-blank range. The dying Rash unsuccessfully tried to write the name of his killer, but no trace was left of the murder. Only the accounts and rumors from various people point to Horn as the one responsible. Rash was supposed to be married to a nearby rancher, [[Ann Bassett]], and the woman accused "Hicks" of being the murderer.

Around the same time, Horn also suspected another cowboy named [[Isom Dart]] of rustling.&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2014) p.237&lt;/ref&gt; Dart was one of Rash's fellow cowboys, but was believed to have previously worked as a rustler named Ned Huddleston and a former member of the late "Tip Gault"'s gang. The gang, which had rustled cattle in the [[Saratoga, Wyoming|Saratoga]] area, had been wiped out in a gun battle. Dart also had three indictments returned against him in [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming|Sweetwater County]]. When Dart was accused of murdering Rash, he took refuge inside his friend's cabin and waited for the rumors to cool down.&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2014), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Horn, however, managed to track Dart to his cabin and saw him hiding together with two other armed associates. The assassin was said to have set up a sniping position under the cover of a pine tree, overlooking the cabin from a hill. As Dart and his friends came out of the cabin, Horn shot him in the chest from a distance. Prior to the assassination, Horn had instructed a rancher named Robert Hudler to ready a horse miles from the murder scene for his getaway.&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2014), p. 237–239.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, two spent [[.30-30 Winchester]] casings were found at the base of a tree where it was believed the murderer had laid in wait. "Hicks" was said to have been the only one in the area to use a .30-30. The news of Rash and Dart's deaths spread throughout the territory, and as such the other rustlers scattered in fear. Horn tracked them all down and killed three other members of Rash's association. The story goes that he pinned one of the dead cowboy's ears for the homesteaders to see as a warning.

===Working for the government===
During the Wilcox train robbery investigation, Horn obtained information from Bill Speck that revealed which of the robbers had killed Sheriff Josiah Hazen during their escape.&lt;ref name="hazen"&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.odmp.org/officer/6276-sheriff-josiah-hazen |title=Sheriff Josiah Hazen, Converse County Sheriff's Office, Wyoming |publisher=[[The Officer Down Memorial Page]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Either [[George Curry (Wild Bunch)|George Curry]] or [[Harvey Logan|Harvey "Kid Curry" Logan]] were said to have killed the sheriff. Both outlaws were members of [[Butch Cassidy]]'s [[Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch|Wild Bunch]] gang, then known as "The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang" after their hideaway in the mountains. Horn passed this information on to [[Charlie Siringo]], who was working the case for the Pinkertons.

Horn briefly entered the [[United States Army]] to serve during the [[Spanish–American War]] as the chief packer of the Fifth Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2014), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; He left [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] for [[Cuba]], where he led some of the [[pack train]]s to the front. Horn personally witnessed the bravery of the famous [[Rough Riders]] and [[Buffalo Soldier|colored regiments]], the Ninth and Tenth Cavalries, during their assault on [[Battle of San Juan Hill|San Juan Hill]], as well as the humiliating rout of American soldiers under Brig. Gen. [[Hamilton Hawkins]]. Although the packers were non-combatants, they were still prone to attack by Cuban rebels. Horn considered himself lucky to have lost no tracker during the war, although Horn recalled that he and his men were under constant fire as they delivered rations and ammunition to the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2014), Murder on Horse Creek.&lt;/ref&gt; Horn continued working as a packer during the war even though he and many of his men contracted [[yellow fever]]. At one point he was bedridden and was deemed unfit for combat. Upon recovering, he returned to Wyoming. Shortly after his return, Horn began working for wealthy cattle baron John C. Coble in 1901, who belonged to the Wyoming Stock Men's Association.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (2001), ''Blood on the Moon''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder of Willie Nickell===
While working again near Iron Mountain, Wyoming, Horn visited the Jim and Dora Miller family on July 15, 1901. They were cattle ranchers. (Jim Miller was no relation to the Texas outlaw [[Jim Miller (outlaw)|Jim Miller]].) Jim Miller and his neighbor Kels Nickell had already had several disputes following Nickell's introduction of sheep into the Iron Mountain area. Miller frequently accused Nickell of letting his sheep graze on Miller's land.&lt;ref name="bowers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tom-horn.com/story-glendolene-kimmell.htm "Glendolene M. Kimmell, The Schoolmarm"], Tom Horn's Story website&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Millers, Horn met Glendolene M. Kimmell, the young teacher at the Iron Mountain School. Ms. Kimmell was supported by both the large Miller and Kels Nickell families, and she boarded with the Millers. Horn entertained her with accounts of his adventures. That day he and males of the Miller family went fishing; he and Victor Miller, a son about his age, also practiced shooting, both of them with .30-30s.&lt;ref name="bowers"/&gt;

The Miller and Nickell families were the only ones to have children at the school. Kimmell had been advised of the families' ongoing feud before she arrived, and found that it was often played out by conflict among the children.&lt;ref name="bowers"/&gt; A few days later, on July 18, 1901, Willie Nickell, the 14-year-old son of sheep ranchers Kels and Mary Nickell, was found murdered near their homestead gate. A coroner's inquest began to investigate the murder. More violent incidents occurred during the period of the coroner's inquest, which was expanded to investigate these incidents, and lasted from July through September 1901.&lt;ref name="bowers"/&gt;

On August 4, 1901, Kels Nickell was shot and wounded. Some 60–80 of his sheep were found "shot or clubbed to death."&lt;ref name="bowers"/&gt; Two of the younger Nickell children later reported seeing two men leaving on horses colored a [[bay horse|bay]] and a gray, as were horses owned by Jim Miller.&lt;ref name="bowers"/&gt; On August 6, 1901, Deputy Sheriff Peter Warlaumont and Deputy U.S. Marshal Joe LeFors came to Iron Mountain and arrested Jim Miller and his sons Victor and Gus on suspicion of shooting Kels Nickell. They were jailed on August 7 and released the following day on bond. The investigation of the shooting of Kels Nickell was added to the investigation of Willie Nickell's murder in the coroner's inquest.&lt;ref name="bowers"/&gt;

Deputy Marshal [[Joe Lefors]] later questioned Horn in January 1902 about the murder, while supposedly talking to him about employment. Horn was still inebriated from the night before, but Lefors gained what he called a confession to the murder of Willie Nickell. Horn allegedly confessed to killing the young Willie with his rifle from 300 yards, which he boasted as the "best shot that [he] ever made and the dirtiest trick that [he] ever done." Horn was arrested the next day by the county sheriff. Walter Stoll was the Laramie County Prosecutor in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Saga of Tom Horn: The Story of a Cattlemen's War, with personal narratives, newspaper accounts, and official documents and testimonies |first=Dean Fenton|last= Krakel |edition= 2 |publisher =Powder River Publishers|year=1954 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Richard H. Scott, who presided over the case, was running for re-election.&lt;ref name="carlson" /&gt;

Horn was supported by his longtime friend and employer, cattle rancher John C. Coble. He gathered a team for the defense headed by former Judge [[John W. Lacey]] and which included attorneys T.F. Burke, Roderick N. Matson, Edward T. Clark and T. Blake Kennedy. Reportedly, Coble paid for most of the costs of this large team. According to Johan P. Bakker, who wrote ''Tracking Tom Horn'', the large cattle interests by this time found Horn "expendable" and the case provided a way to silence him in regard to their activities. He wrote that 100 members of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association paid $1000 each toward the defense, but wanted a minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;Johan P. Bakker, ''Tracking Tom Horn''(Union Lake: Talking Boy, 1993) pp. 127, 131-132&lt;/ref&gt;

Horn's trial started October 10, 1902 in Cheyenne, which filled with crowds attracted by the notoriety of Horn. ''The Rocky Mountain News'' noted the carnival atmosphere and great interest from the public for a conviction.&lt;ref name="bowers"/&gt; The prosecution introduced Horn's confession to Lefors. Only certain parts of Horn's statement were introduced, distorting his statement. The prosecution introduced testimony by at least two witnesses, including Lefors, as well as [[circumstantial evidence]]; these elements only placed Horn in the general vicinity of the crime scene. During the trial, Victor Miller testified that he and Horn both had .30-30 guns and bought their ammunition at the same store.&lt;ref name="bowers"/&gt; Another, Otto Plaga, testified that Horn was 20 miles from the scene of the murder an hour after it was committed.&lt;ref name="Psycho"/&gt;

Glendolene Kimmell had testified during the coroner's inquest, saying she thought both the Miller and Nickell families responsible for maintaining the feud, but she was never called as a defense witness. She had resigned from the school in October 1901 and left the area, but was in communication with people in the case.

Horn's trial went to the jury on October 23, and they returned a guilty verdict the next day.&lt;ref name="bowers"&gt;[http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/robertshistory/school_bells_and_winchesters.htm  Carol L. Bowers. "School Bells and Winchesters: The Sad Saga of Glendolene Myrtle Kimmell"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614073651/http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/RobertsHistory/school_bells_and_winchesters.htm |date=2010-06-14 }}, ''READINGS IN WYOMING HISTORY (5th Revised Edition), Ed. Phil Roberts, University of Wyoming, 2007, Retrieved 2012-10-10&lt;/ref&gt; A hearing several days later sentenced Horn to death by hanging. Horn's attorneys filed a petition with the [[Wyoming Supreme Court]] for a new trial. While in jail, Horn wrote his autobiography, ''Life of Tom Horn, Government Scout and Interpreter, Written by Himself'', mostly giving an account of his early life. It contained little about the case.

The Wyoming Supreme Court upheld the decision of the District Court and denied a new trial. Convinced of Horn's innocence, Glendolene Kimmell sent an affidavit to Governor [[Fenimore Chatterton]] with testimony reportedly saying that Victor Miller was guilty of Nickell's murder. Accounts of its contents appeared in the press, but the original document has since disappeared.&lt;ref name="bowers"/&gt; The governor chose not to intervene in the case. Horn was initially given an execution date of November 20, 1903.

==Execution==
Tom Horn was one of the few people in the "Wild West" to have been hanged by a water-powered gallows, known as the "Julian Gallows." James P. Julian, a [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]] architect, designed the contraption in 1892. The trap door was connected to a lever which pulled the plug out of a barrel of water. This would cause a lever with a counterweight to rise, pulling on the support beam under the gallows. When enough pressure was applied, the beam broke free, opening the trap and hanging the condemned man.

Horn was hanged in Cheyenne. At that time, Horn never gave up the names of those who had hired him during the feud.&lt;ref name="Psycho"/&gt; He was buried in the Columbia Cemetery in [[Boulder, Colorado]] on December 3, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Outlaw Tales of Wyoming: True Stories of the Cowboy State's Most Infamous Crooks, Culprits, and Cutthroats|page=115|first= R. Michael |last=Wilson |publisher= Globe Pequot|year= 2008 |ISBN =978-0-7627-4506-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rancher Jim Coble paid for his coffin and a stone to mark his grave.&lt;ref name="bowers"/&gt; After his death, many considered Horn was wrongly executed for a murder solely based on a drunk confession. Even the old Apache warrior, [[Geronimo]], expressed his doubts about Horn's charges during an interview with Charles Ackenhausen, saying that he "did not believe [Horn] guilty."&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2014), A Man Apart.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
It is still debated whether Horn was responsible for Nickell's murder. Historians including Chip Carlson believe he did not, while others such as Dean Fenton Krakel believe that he did, but had not realized he was shooting a boy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Saga_of_Tom_Horn.html?id=_H5vrDEEjPIC Krakel, Dean, (1954/1988). ''The Saga of Tom Horn''], Powder River Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus is that regardless of whether Horn committed that particular murder, he had certainly committed many others.&lt;ref name="Tom Horn"/&gt; Carlson, who extensively researched the ''Wyoming v. Tom Horn'' trial, concluded that although Horn ''could have'' committed the murder of Willie Nickell, he probably did not. According to Carlson's book, ''Tom Horn: Blood on the Moon'' (2001), there was no physical evidence that Horn had committed the murder. In addition, he was last seen in the area the day ''before'' it occurred, and the conditions of his alleged confession made it without value as evidence. Carlson believed the prosecution made no efforts to investigate other possible suspects, including Victor Miller. In essence, Horn's reputation and history made him an easy target for the prosecution.&lt;ref name="carlson" /&gt;

The case was retried in a [[mock trial]] in 1993 in Cheyenne, and Horn was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Was Tom Horn really guilty of the murder for which he was hanged? |date= 20 May 2014 |first= Marshall |last=Trimble |work= True West Magazine |url= https://truewestmagazine.com/was-tom-horn-really-guilty-of-the-murder-for-which-he-was-hanged/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the historian Larry Ball, [[Emeritus|professor emeritus]] at [[Arkansas State University]] in [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]], [[Arkansas]], published ''Tom Horn in Life and Legend''. Ball was fascinated by Horn's conflicting and enigmatic personality. Ball said that he is convinced that Horn shot and killed Willie Nickell near the Iron Mountain area: "I have to fall back on the historical record." Ball said that he found no evidence of a legal conspiracy against Horn. He added that Horn's penchant for brutality contributed to his being convicted of the murder.&lt;ref name=wyote/&gt;

At a discussion of their findings that year, Chip Carlson of Cheyenne continued his support of Horn's innocence, saying: "I maintain that Tom Horn was railroaded" because Horn had been employed by cattle barons who were at odds with the homesteaders. Carlson also noted that the presiding judge at Horn's trial was a candidate for reelection at the time. Carlson described Horn in the trial as "his own worst enemy. The more he talked, the tighter the noose" became.&lt;ref name=wyote&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2014/08/23/news/01top_08-23-14.txt#.U_nrKMtAQ5s|title=Legend of Tom Horn refuses to die: Western history authors Larry Ball and Chip Carlson talked about Wyoming legend Tom Horn Friday at a program at the Wyoming State Museum|author=Becky Orr|date=August 22, 2014|publisher=''[[Wyoming Tribune-Eagle]]''|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1516">'''Unlicensed broadcasting''', also called '''pirate broadcasting''' is a term used for any type of [[broadcasting]] without a [[broadcast license]].

Some  unlicensed broadcasting, such as certain [[low-power broadcasting]], may be legal.  For example, in the [[United States]], [[Title 47 CFR Part 15]] (or "part 15"), is a regulation that allows unlicensed broadcasting within a range of just a few meters. Legal broadcast methods may include [[ISM band]]s, used legally at low power to broadcast for personal use, a [[video sender]], used to distribute video (sometimes wireless security cameras) within a home or small business, or FM transmitters, used to transmit satellite radio or digital media players to stereo systems which have no wired input (i.e. car radios).

{{main|Pirate radio|Pirate television}}
The term "pirate broadcasting," by contrast, is almost always used to indicate broadcasting that is illegal, particularly as applied to [[pirate radio]] and [[pirate television]]. The justifications usually given for legal prohibitions on broadcasting include the need to keep certain broadcast frequencies open for emergency communications, the need to control the broadcasting of material that is [[obscenity|obscene]] or violates [[copyright]]s, and the preservation of government revenue derived from licensing airwaves.

The '''Wakker Prize''' (in German: ''Wakkerpreis'', in French ''Prix Wakker'', in Italian ''Premio Wakker'') is awarded annually by the [[Swiss Heritage Society]] to a [[Municipality of Switzerland]] for the development and preservation of its architectural heritage.

At the beginning, the prize honoured municipalities which did special needs for preservation of the old towns. Recently,{{When|date=January 2015}} the prize also honours municipalities that develop their townscapes on a specific leading point. This might be an estimated use of an old industrial facility or a successful combination between old and new basic structure of a building.

In 2005, the prize was given to the [[Swiss Federal Railways]], rather than a municipality, because of the jubilee of the Swiss Heritage Society.

The prize is named for [[Henri-Louis Wakker]].

==Criteria==
To get this prize, municipalities have to follow the named criteria:
* A visible, qualitative development and upgrading of townscape in a contemporary manner.
* To be respectful towards with old settlement pattern.
* An active input for above-average architectural quality, due to a good example of the municipality.
* The current place-planning prefers the development of the prize.
* At the end are following issues important for the overall assessment, protection of the area, sustainability, traffic planning and residential quality.

[[Image:Ixion.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|[[José Ribera]]'s grittily realistic ''Ixion'', 1632 ([[Museo del Prado]]).]]

In a [[literary]] context, a '''wheel of fire''' may refer to the chain of tortuous or dire consequences that result from a single action.

==In mythology==
The Wheel of Fire originates in [[Greek mythology|Greek mythology]] as the punishment for [[Ixion]], who was bound to a wheel of fire for lusting after [[Zeus]]'s wife, [[Hera]].

==In literature==
The Wheel of Fire is part of the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] reading of a [[tragedy]] (e.g., plays), which includes the central [[character flaw|flaw]] within a character. In Shakespeare's tragedy ''[[Othello]]'', the flaw in [[Othello (character)|Othello himself]] is his vulnerability to jealousy and his tendency to believe [[Iago]], who is manipulating Othello into believing his wife is unfaithful. As a result of this flaw Othello loses a loyal friend, murders his wife, and is driven insane before eventually committing suicide. In this scenario the Wheel of Fire begins with the action of Othello trusting Iago and consequently the other events occur.

The Wheel of Fire is most commonly applied to the [[protagonist]] within a tragedy (i.e. the hero) and may aim to provoke sympathy from the audience when the hero falls from grace (this purging of emotions is known as ''[[catharsis]]''), though it also adds dramatic interest to the performance.

The Wheel of Fire is also the title of [[G. Wilson Knight]]'s book on Shakespearean tragedy.

In Shakespeare's ''King Lear'', Lear states: "But I am bound upon a wheel of fire, / That mine own tears do scald like molten lead".{{OR|date=August 2018}}{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===In Tolkien===
In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the [[One Ring]] is described as a "wheel of fire".

:"I begin to see it in my mind all the time, like a great wheel of fire." -- [[Frodo Baggins]] speaking to [[Samwise Gamgee]].

Also: "A crouching shape, scarcely more than the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure robed in white, but at its breast it held a wheel of fire." -- A description of [[Gollum]] and Frodo, respectively, as seen by Samwise.

The portrayal of '''[[Warrior|women warriors]]''' in [[literature]] and [[popular culture]] is a subject of study in history, literary studies, film studies, folklore history, and mythology. The archetypal figure of the woman warrior is an example of a normal thing that happens in some cultures, while also being a [[counter stereotype]], opposing the normal construction of war, violence and aggression as masculine.&lt;ref name="Stringer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stringer|first1=Rebecca|editor1-last=Radner|editor1-first=Hilary|editor2-last=Stringer|editor2-first=Rebecca|title=Feminism at the Movies|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|chapter=From Victim to Vigilante: Gender, Violence, and Revenge in ''The Brave One'' (2007) and ''Hard Candy'' (2005)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|269}} This convention-defying position makes the female warrior a prominent site of investigation for discourses surrounding female power and [[gender roles]] in society.

==Folklore and mythology==
[[File:Medieval women as warriors.jpg|thumb|upright|Medieval women helping to defend the city from attack.]]
{{See also|List of women warriors in folklore}}
In Hindu mythology, [[Chitrāngadā]], wife of [[Arjuna]], was the commander of her father's armies.

The [[Amazons]] were an entire tribe of woman warriors in Greek legend. "Amazon" has become an [[eponym]] for woman warriors and athletes in both modern and ancient society.

In British mythology, [[Queen Cordelia]] fought off several contenders for her throne by personally leading the army in its battles as well as defending her home from her own warring family members, until she eventually commits suicide due to grief. Another example in ancient British history is Queen [[Boudica]], who lead a rebellion against the [[Roman Empire]].

In his ''On the Bravery of Women'' the Greco-Roman historian [[Plutarch]] describes how the women of Argos fought against King Cleomenes and the Spartans under the command of [[Telesilla]] in the fifth century BCE.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Bravery_of_Women*/A.html|title=Plutarch • On the Bravery of Women — Sections I‑XV|publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women Writers of Ancient Greece and Rome: An Anthology|author=Plant, I.M.|date=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806136219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYGay_yqBLUC|page=33|accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary women warriors include "[[Gordafarid]]" (Persian: گردآفريد) in the ancient Persian epic poem [[The Shāhnāmeh]], [[Delhemma]] in [[Arabic epic literature]], [[Mulan]], [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Belphoebe]] and [[Britomartis|Britomart]] in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', [[Bradamante]] and [[Marfisa]] in ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', [[Clorinda (Jerusalem Delivered)|Clorinda]] and (reluctantly) Erminia in ''[[La Gerusalemme liberata]]'', and [[Grendel's mother]].

The woman warrior is part of a long tradition in many different cultures including Chinese and Japanese martial arts films, but their reach and appeal to Western audiences is possibly much more recent, coinciding with the greatly increased number of female heroes in American media since 1990.&lt;ref name="Heinecken"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Warrior Women of Television: A Feminist Cultural Analysis of the Female Body in Popular Media|date=2003|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|last1=Dawn|first1=Heinecken}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|136}}&lt;ref name="Tasker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tasker|first1=Yvonne|title=Spectacular Bodies: Gender, Genre and the Action Cinema|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

==In feminism==
Women warriors have been taken up as a symbol for feminist empowerment, emphasizing women's agency and capacity for power instead of the common pattern of female victim-hood.&lt;ref name="Stringer" /&gt;{{rp|269}}  Professor Sherrie Inness in ''Tough Girls: Women Warriors and Wonder Women in Popular Culture''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/945.html Tough Girls: Women Warriors and Wonder Women in Popular Culture]''&lt;/ref&gt; and Frances Early and Kathleen Kennedy in ''Athena's Daughters: Television's New Women Warriors'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.syracuseuniversitypress.syr.edu/spring-2003-catalog/athenas-daughters.html Athena’s Daughters: Television’s New Women Warriors]''&lt;/ref&gt; for example, focus on figures such as [[Xena]], from the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' or [[Buffy Summers]] from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. In the introduction to their text, Early and Kennedy discuss what they describe as a link between the image of women warriors and [[Girl Power|girl power]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=238391094059727 Book review]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Violence===
Although there is a distinction between positive aggression and violence, fictional representations of female violence like ''[[Kill Bill]]'' still have the power to function positively, equipping women for real-life situations that require outward aggression.&lt;ref name=Lavin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lavin|first1=Maud|title=Push Comes to Shove: New Images of Aggressive Women|date=2010|publisher=MIT|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108,237}} Beyond the individual level, fictional depictions of violence by women can be a political tool to draw attention to real-world issues of violence, such as the ongoing violence against Indigenous women.&lt;ref name=Verstraten&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verstraten|first1=Katelyn|title=For Indigenous Women, Radical Art as a Last Resort|url=https://thetyee.ca/ArtsAndCulture/2013/06/22/Radical-Art/|accessdate=1 November 2015|work=The Tyee|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that a violent heroine undermines the feminist ethics against male violence, even when she is posited as a defender of women, for example in films such as ''[[Hard Candy (film)|Hard Candy]]''.&lt;ref name=Stringer /&gt;{{rp|269}}

[[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' praised the first three ''X-Men'' films as "more than a cash-guzzling wham-bang Hollywood franchise ... these three movies sport philosophy, ideas, a telethon-load of causes, and a highly elastic us-versus-them allegory." Morris praised ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' for "put[ting] the heroes of a mighty summer blockbuster in a rare mortal position. Realism at this time of year? How unorthodox!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Wesley |last=Morris |title=X-Men: The Last Stand Movie Review |work=Boston Globe |date=May 5, 2006 |url=http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&amp;id=6883 |accessdate=August 3, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906221707/http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&amp;id=6883 |archivedate=September 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the films mostly positive reviews, but criticized them for the amount of mutants, stating "their powers are so various and ill-matched that it's hard to keep them all on the same canvas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Roger Ebert |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=X-Men: The Last Stand (PG-13) |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=May 26, 2006 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060525/REVIEWS/60509005/1023 |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310205908/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060525%2FREVIEWS%2F60509005%2F1023 |archivedate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two films were highly praised due to their [[wikt:cerebral|cerebral]] tone. However, when director Bryan Singer left the series, many criticized his successor, Brett Ratner. Colin Colvert of the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' felt "Singer's sensitivity to [the discrimination themes] made the first two ''X-Men'' films surprisingly resonant and soulful for comic-based summer extravaganzas ... Singer is adept at juggling large casts of three-dimensional characters, Ratner makes shallow, unimaginative bang-ups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Colin |last=Colvert |title=Movie review: 'X-Men' trilogy goes down in flames |work=[[Star Tribune]] |date=May 25, 2006 |url=http://www.startribune.com/412/story/455017.html |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814022350/http://www.startribune.com/412/story/455017.html |archivedate=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] felt, "''X-Men: The Last Stand'' isn't as taut or satisfying as ''X-Men 2'', but it's better constructed and better paced than the original ''X-Men''. The differences in quality between the three are minor, however; despite the change in directors, there seems to be a single vision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=James Berardinelli |first=James |last=Berardinelli |title=X-Men: The Last Stand |publisher=Reelviews |year=2006 |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/x/x-men3.html |accessdate=August 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Denby of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' praised "the liquid beauty and the poetic fantasy of Singer's work", but called Ratner's film "a crude synthesizer of comedy and action tropes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Denby |authorlink=David Denby |work=The New Yorker |title=Violent Times |date=June 5, 2006 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/06/05/060605crci_cinema |accessdate=August 3, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929170122/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/06/05/060605crci_cinema |archivedate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer's third film in the series, ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' was also well received. Alonso Duralde of ''[[The Wrap]]'' felt that "Singer keeps things moving along briskly enough that you can just go along with the ride of Superhero Stuff without getting bogged down".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/x-men-days-future-past-review-mutant-sage-crosses-streams-hugh-jackman/ |title=X-Men: Days of Future Past Review: Mutant Saga Crosses the Stream of Its Old-School and Newer Characters |date=May 12, 2014 |accessdate=May 30, 2014 |last=Duralde |first=Alonso |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524045418/http://www.thewrap.com/x-men-days-future-past-review-mutant-sage-crosses-streams-hugh-jackman/ |archivedate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Spider-Man'' director [[Sam Raimi]] said he was a fan of the series, particularly Singer's films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brian |last=Cronin |title=Guest Spot: Rohan Williams Interviews Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert (Part 1) |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=November 28, 2007 |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/11/28/guest-spot-rohan-williams-interviews-sam-raimi-and-rob-tapert-part-1/ |accessdate=November 28, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206093132/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/11/28/guest-spot-rohan-williams-interviews-sam-raimi-and-rob-tapert-part-1/ |archivedate=December 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film historian [[Kim Newman]] also tonally compared ''[[Batman Begins]]'' to Singer's films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Kim Newman |first=kim |last=Newman |title=Batman Begins (12A) |work=Empire |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=11299 |accessdate=August 3, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185128/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=11299 |archivedate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logan'' received a nomination from [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/logan-oscar-nomination.html |title=Logan's Oscar Nomination Is a Significant Breakthrough |last=Riesman |first=Abraham |date=January 23, 2018 |accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was criticism of the large cast, and the limited screentime for all of them. Richard George of [[IGN]] reacted well to the depictions of Wolverine, Professor X, Magneto, Jean Grey, Storm, William Stryker, Mystique, Beast and Nightcrawler; however, George thought many of the younger X-Men characters, such as Rogue, Iceman, Pyro, Angel and Kitty Pryde were "adjectiveless teenager[s]", and was disappointed by Cyclops' characterization. He observed the filmmakers were "big fans of silent henchmen", due to the small roles of the various villainous mutants; such as [[Lady Deathstrike]] and Psylocke.&lt;ref name="george"&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard |last=George |title=X-Men in Film |publisher=IGN.com |date=December 15, 2006 |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/751/751277p1.html |accessdate=August 3, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817102020/http://comics.ign.com/articles/751/751277p1.html |archivedate=August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Jesse Schedeen of IGN, stated that the continuity of the films doesn't make sense with dead characters returning with zero or little explanation, different versions of the same character appearing across multiple films and plot points that are conveniently ignored in later films. He also criticized 20th Century Fox for not mapping out the series from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://m.ign.com/articles/2017/03/23/17-reasons-x-men-movie-continuity-makes-no-sense |date=March 23, 2017 |title=17 Reasons X-Men Movie Continuity Makes No Sense |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |accessdate=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Richard George of IGN stated that the success of the first ''X-Men'' film paved the way for comic-book film adaptations such as the [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' series]], ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' (2005), ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' and Singer's ''[[Superman Returns]]''.&lt;ref name="george"/&gt; Chris Hewitt of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine called the first ''X-Men'' film as the "catalyst" for films based on Marvel Comics characters, stating "Singer's 2000 film is the catalyst for everything that's come since, good and bad. Without it, there's no [[Marvel Studios]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1892 |title=Bryan Singer on the Complete Story of the X-Men |last=Hewitt |first=Chris |accessdate=August 9, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811002858/http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1892 |archivedate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic-book writer Mark Millar said that Singer's ''X-Men'' "revolutionized" superhero films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/mark-millar-x-men-wolverine-fantastic-four-movies/ |title=Mark Millar Talks Shepherding Fox's Marvel Movie Universe &amp; Upcoming Movies |accessdate=August 9, 2014 |last=Outlaw |first=Kofi |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006134308/http://screenrant.com/mark-millar-x-men-wolverine-fantastic-four-movies/ |archivedate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Rubin of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine stated that the X-Men franchise has proven there's an audience for a hardline superhero film. While Jeff Bock of Exhibitor Relations said that with films like the Deadpool films and ''Logan'', that studios can do more with an R-rated film, and give the audience something new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/box-office/deadpool-2-disney-fox-merger-1202817235/ |title=Will 'Deadpool 2' Make Disney Open to Releasing R-Rated Movies Again? |last=Rubin |first=Rebecca |date=May 21, 2018 |accessdate=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
