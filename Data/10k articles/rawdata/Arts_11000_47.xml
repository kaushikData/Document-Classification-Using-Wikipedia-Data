{{for|the film|Journey Beyond Three Seas}}

'''''A Journey Beyond the Three Seas''''' ({{lang-ru|Хожение за три моря}}, ''Khozheniye za tri morya'') is a [[Russian literature|Russian]] literary monument in the form of travel notes, made by a [[merchant]] from [[Tver]], [[Afanasiy Nikitin]] during his journey to [[India]] in 1466–1472.

''A Journey Beyond the Three Seas'' was the first Russian literary work to depict a strictly [[commerce|commercial]], non-[[religious]] trip. Prior texts were pilgrimage texts, which depicted travel to holy sites and were more standardized, dry and conventional. The author visited the [[Caucasus]], [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]], India and the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]. However, most of the notes are dedicated to India, its political structure, [[trade]], [[agriculture]], [[convention (norm)|custom]]s and ceremonies. The work is full of lyrical [[digression]]s and [[Autobiography|autobiographic]] passages. There is a strong individual, authorial presence. Its last page is in [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and the broken [[Arabic language]]; these are, in fact, typical Muslim prayers, indicating that Nikitin might have converted to [[Islam]] while he was in India, although his lapse from Christianity bothered him as he mentions several times in the text.&lt;ref&gt;For a translation of Nikitin's account, see Richard H. Major, ed. "The Travels of Athanasius Nikitin," tr. Mikhail M. Wielhorsky. In India ''in the Fifteenth Century''. Hakluyt Society, ser. 1. volume 22. (London: Hakluyt Society, 1857).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, however, Nikitin all time prays to [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] as [[Theotokos]], Christian Orthodox [[Saints]], tries to observe Christian rites, and so on.
The author did not make his way back to his native land; he died on the trip home. 
In 1475, the [[manuscript]] made its way to [[Moscow]] into the hands of a government official Vasili Mamyrev. Later on, it was incorporated into the [[annals|annalistic]] code of 1489, the [[Sofia Second Chronicle]] and the [[Lvov Chronicle]].

'''Amy Barnes''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]. She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 14 November 2005. Amy was created by executive producer David Hanson and Slanina-Davies was offered the role whilst looking for work as an extra. In 2009, Slanina-Davies stated that she would be lost without the role and confirmed her loyalty to the serial. In July 2010, it was announced that Slanina-Davies would be leaving the show. However it was revealed that she was back filming and staying in the serial in 2011. Amy's storylines have included underage pregnancy which resulted in the birth of daughter [[Leah Barnes]] and the subject of [[domestic abuse]] in her relationship with [[Ste Hay]], portrayed by [[Kieron Richardson]] respectively. Whilst filming the storyline Slanina-Davies cut her long hair off for charity and this was scripted into the storyline.

Amy has also been part of a storyline which saw her pretending her daughter was suffering from [[leukaemia]] to scam money out of the community, off-screen this prompted Slanina-Davies to campaign for leukaemia and cancer charity [[CLIC Sargent]] and [[Women's Aid Federation of England|Women's Aid]]. The issue of [[post-natal depression]] has been portrayed following the birth of her second child [[Lucas Hay]]. Slanina-Davies has also revealed that she has conducted extensive research into all of her issue-lead storylines. In 2012, it was announced that Slanina-Davies would be written out of the serial. Amy departed on 8 August 2012. Amy returned for guest appearances throughout 2013, 2014 and 2015, before returning to the show on a permanent basis in August 2016.

In January 2017, it was revealed that Amy would be departing later in the year in a "[[whodunit]]" storyline which would see the character killed off after being murdered.&lt;ref name=finalamyexit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks is killing off a regular character and you'll be heartbroken over who it is|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a818160/hollyoaks-spoilers-amy-barnes-death-storyline-revealed/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=3 January 2017|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her final appearance as a corpse on 29 March 2017, however continued to appear in flashback appearances throughout the storyline. Amy's funeral was held on 25 April 2017, with characters such as her mother, [[Kathy Barnes|Kathy]] ([[Sarah Jane Buckley]]), and [[Zoe Carpenter]] ([[Zoë Lister]]), returning for her funeral. On 4 September 2017, Ste's fiancé, [[Harry Thompson (Hollyoaks)|Harry Thompson]] ([[Parry Glasspool]]), was named as the culprit who killed Amy. However, on 8 September 2017, it was revealed that Amy was still alive after Harry left, meaning he was not responsible. Amy appeared again for a final time in a flashback episode which aired on 10 October 2017, where her new husband [[Ryan Knight (Hollyoaks)|Ryan Knight]] ([[Duncan James]]) strangled her, revealing him as her killer.

==Casting==
In 2005 executive producer David Hanson created the Barnes family which included Amy. Actress Ashley Slanina-Davies was looking for work as an extra at the time, but her audition secured her the regular role of Amy.&lt;ref name="wigan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview With Ashley Slanina-Davies |url=http://www.wlct.org/Culture/linconline/ashleysd.htm |work=LINC Online |publisher=Wigan Leisure &amp; Culture Trust |accessdate=21 October 2016 |date=March 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vR7RGWGD?url=http://www.wlct.org/Culture/linconline/ashleysd.htm |archivedate=2 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her first appearance in November 2005. In 2009 Slanina-Davies admitted she was committed to the serial, stating she "would be at a loss" without the role.&lt;ref name="wigan"/&gt; In 2010, it was announced that Slanina-Davies would leave later in the year. This was confirmed at the same time as [[Garnon Davies]] ([[Elliot Bevan]]), [[Glen Wallace]] ([[Malachy Fisher]]) and [[John Pickard (British actor)|John Pickard]] ([[Dominic Reilly]]) announced their departures. A spokesperson for the serial stated: "We're all sad to be losing yet more friends from the cast [...] Nothing's been firmed up yet storyline-wise but one thing's for sure, they'll all be memorable exits."&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a240962/four-more-to-leave-hollyoaks.html|title=Exclusive: Four more to leave 'Hollyoaks'|last=Green|first=Kris|date=9 July 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=9 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100710225718/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a240962/four-more-to-leave-hollyoaks.html| archivedate= 10 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2010 it was revealed that Davies was still filming with Hollyoaks and would remain in the serial in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=2011 Special Sneak Preview! - Hollyoaks|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=1 January 2011|issue=52|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also add: "She's not mean-spirited, but she's known for trouble-making."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC America - Hollyoaks - Amy Barnes|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/232/index.jsp|publisher=[[BBC America]]|accessdate=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707214855/http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/232/index.jsp|archivedate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her later years she transformed into a single and more confident woman. She is described on the show's official website as not "afraid to stick up for herself".&lt;ref name=character/&gt;[[File:Ashley Slanina-Davies.jpg|thumb|200px|Ashley Slanina-Davies (''pictured'') cut her hair short for Amy's domestic abuse storyline.]]

===Relationship with Ste Hay===
In 2007 after Amy resumes her relationship with [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) and they move into their own flat, Ste became increasingly violent and started to hit Amy, which was the start of a domestic abuse storyline. Slanina-Davies conducted extensive research into the plot&lt;ref name="wigan"/&gt; During an interview with LINC Online she stated: "I research pretty much everything I’m involved in. It's important to be realistic because there’ll be people out there watching who are hoping to relate to your character. I think if you didn’t research properly you’d only end up alienating the people you want to try and empathise with."&lt;ref name="wigan"/&gt; One segment of the storyline saw Ste cutting off her ponytail. In real life Slanina-Davies had cut her hair short to raise money for charity of this she stated: "When I had my hair cut short in Hollyoaks I did that to raise money for CLIC Sargant, which is a charity helping children with cancer and leukaemia."&lt;ref name="wigan"/&gt;

At this time, Amy fell pregnant, but was unsure whether to keep the baby. Slanina-Davies stated that she loved portraying pregnancy in the serial and commented on Amy's dilemma of abortion stating: "I have absolutely no opinion on whether Amy should keep her baby, because I think it's a woman's right to choose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashley Slanina-Davies' pregnancy love |url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/tv/Hollyoaks-53046.html |work=Female First |publisher=First Active Media Ltd |accessdate=21 October 2016 |date=29 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vR9qWSak?url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/tv/Hollyoaks-53046.html |archivedate=2 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about 2008 as a whole for Ste and Amy, producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] stated: "I'm really proud of the way Kieron Richardson has portrayed Ste, dare I say sympathetically, so we can understand but not condone his behaviour. He and Ashley [Slanina Davies] are delivering brilliant performances as two young kids portray the reality of so many 16- and 17-year-olds as they struggle to make a life for themselves and repeat the mistakes of their parents. It's a very real situation and some of their scenes still to come are downright shocking. It's set to become a very big story as the year progresses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a96321/bonus-scoop-hollyoaks-producer-bryan-kirkwood.html|title= Bonus Scoop: Hollyoaks Producer Bryan Kirkwood|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=20 May 2008 |accessdate=21 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804160043/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a96321/bonus-scoop-hollyoaks-producer-bryan-kirkwood.html |archivedate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ste later takes a violent outburst to far and a spokesperson for the serial described it as "the final straw" for Amy.&lt;ref name="now"/&gt; She is later shown leaving Ste after finally realising she needs to accept help from those closest to her.&lt;ref name="now"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollyoaks' Amy Barnes flees violent boyfriend |url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/celebrity-news/tv-news/265752/spoiler-alert--hollyoaks--amy-barnes-flees-violent-boyfriend/1/ |work=[[NOW (British magazine)|NOW]] |accessdate=21 October 2016 |date=4 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130421014756/http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/tv-news/265752/spoiler-alert-hollyoaks-amy-barnes-flees-violent-boyfriend |archivedate=21 April 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slanina-Davies and Richardson then fronted a charity campaign called "Expect Respect" in order to combat domestic violence. At the time Slanina-Davies released a statement reading: "Domestic abuse takes many forms, it can be physical, sexual or mental. In Hollyoaks, my character Amy faced this in her relationship with Ste and I know from this storyline why it can be difficult to leave an abusive relationship."&lt;ref name="respect"&gt;{{cite web |title=Women's Aid launches teenage domestic violence campaign with Bliss magazine |url=http://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic-violence-press-information.asp?itemid=1783&amp;itemTitle=Women%92s+Aid+launches+teenage+domestic+violence+campaign+with+Bliss+magazine&amp;section=0001000100150001&amp;sectionTitle=Press+releases |work=[[Women's Aid Federation of England|Women's Aid]] |publisher=([[Women's Aid Federation of England|WAFE]]) |accessdate=21 October 2016 |date=10 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vRDJHeK8?url=http://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic-violence-press-information.asp?itemid=1783&amp;itemTitle=Women%EF%BF%BDs+Aid+launches+teenage+domestic+violence+campaign+with+Bliss+magazine&amp;section=0001000100150001&amp;sectionTitle=Press+releases |archivedate=2 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Il Gnosh fire===
In 2010 Amy was involved in a special week of episodes dubbed "fire week".&lt;ref name="s"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Cara |title=Deadly blaze hits Hollyoaks |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/3126981/Deadly-blaze-hits-Hollyoaks.html |work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |accessdate=21 October 2016 |date=6 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vQHkVdfM?url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/3126981/Deadly-blaze-hits-Hollyoaks.html |archivedate=1 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy was described as battling to save her two children [[Leah Barnes]] (Jessica Croft-Lane) and [[Lucas Hay]] (Jude Hawley) in the blaze with executive producer [[Paul Marquess]] stating: "I will say is that it will be shocking."&lt;ref name="s"/&gt; In early 2011 Marquess revealed that Amy would be staying in the show permanently and be involved in a serious storyline in which [[Leanne Holiday]] (Jessica Forrest) would do some "terrible things" to Amy.&lt;ref name="ele"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |title=More 'Hollyoaks' chat from Paul Marquess |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a295729/more-hollyoaks-chat-from-paul-marquess.html |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |accessdate=21 October 2016 |date=4 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vUWtQKWD?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a295729/more-hollyoaks-chat-from-paul-marquess.html |archivedate=4 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer [[Gareth Phillips]] later revealed that there was never any plans for Amy to leave.&lt;ref name="secretsrevealed"/&gt; They filmed alternative endings to confuse viewers and added they had been "mischievous" in doing so. He said it made the serial more exciting and that they had lots of storylines for Amy and Lee because they "make a great pairing".&lt;ref name="secretsrevealed"&gt;{{cite journal|date=26 March – 1 April 2011|title=Soap's biggest secrets revealed!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=12|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure and returns===
Amy was written out of the series in 2012.

The '''Australia Council for the Arts''', informally known as the '''Australia Council''', is the official [[arts council]] or arts funding body of the [[Government of Australia]]

==Function==
The Australia Council (the Council) is the Australian Government’s principal arts funding and advisory body. The Council is the national advocate for the arts and its purpose is to champion and invest in Australian arts. This national leadership role is achieved by supporting and building Australia’s arts ecology by fostering excellence in the arts and increasing national and international engagement with Australian arts. 

== History ==
Australia Council was formed in 1967 by Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]] as a body for the public funding of the arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given statutory authority in March 1975 by the ''Australia Council Act''. The Council's predecessor, the Australian Council for the Arts was established in 1968 by Prime Minister [[John Gorton]] as a division of the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet]]. The Council then incorporated other government projects, such as the [[Commonwealth Literary Fund]] and the [[Commonwealth Art Advisory Board]]. It operates in co-ordination with the various [[states and territories of Australia|state government]] agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/about/our-structure/&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Council’s operations were independently reviewed in 2012, and the ''Australia Council Act 2013'' (the Act) commenced on 1 July 2013.

In early 2014 federal Ministers Brandis and Turnbull told artists at the Sydney Biennale that they were ungrateful and selfish to protest about the role of Transfield in Nauru. In December 2014, Arts Minister, [[George Brandis]], took away a large portion of literature funding from Australia Council.&lt;ref&gt;''The Conversation'', 16 October 2016, [http://theconversation.com/arts-training-is-an-essential-part-of-an-innovative-nation-67303 Arts training is an essential part of an innovative nation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NoMinister&gt;InDaily, 24 October 2016, [http://indaily.com.au/arts-and-culture/2016/10/24/no-minister-creative-arts-are-not-lifestyle-choice/ No minister, creative arts are not a "lifestyle choice"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Brandis cut $26 million a year for four years from Australia Council arts funding, a third of its arts funding, receiving significant criticism from the arts community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/george-brandis-turns-arts-into-political-football-with-1047m-australia-council-cuts-20150513-gh0d0n.html|title=George Brandis turns arts into 'political football' with $104.7m Australia Council cuts|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-17/brandis-accused-of-neglecting-arts-politicising-funding/6629322|title=Private arts donors Neil Balnaves and Luca Belgiorno-Nettis accuse George Brandis of neglecting arts community, politicising funding|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money was reallocated to a new program, the '''National Program for Excellence in the Arts''' (NPEA). NPEA in turn was criticised by many artists and arts organisations for lacking the "arms-length" funding principles that had applied to the relationship between the government and Australia Council since its inception in the 1970s. These principles have traditionally had bipartisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/the-regrettable-rise-of-the-arts-bureaucrat-20150518-gh4o01.html|title=The regrettable rise of the arts bureaucrat|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stuartglover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/writers-and-publishers-are-all-at-sea-under-brandis-and-the-npea-44842|title=Writers and publishers are all at sea under Brandis and the NPEA|author=Stuart Glover|date=20 July 2015|work=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/the-australia-council-must-hold-firm-on-arms-length-funding-24460|title=The Australia Council must hold firm on ‘arm’s length’ funding|work=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandis was criticised previously for giving Melbourne classical music record label Melba Recordings a $275,000 grant outside of the usual funding and peer-assessment processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/04/australias-arts-funding-crisis-george-brandis-one-man-show|title=George Brandis and the arts funding crisis: one hell of a one-man show|author=Ben Eltham|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandis's changes to funding arrangements, including the quarantining of the amount received by Australia's 28 major performing arts companies, were widely seen to disadvantage the small-to-medium arts sector and independent artists.&lt;ref name="stuartglover"/&gt; Following Malcolm Turnbull's successful [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, September 2015|spill]] of the leadership of the Liberal party in September 2015, Brandis was replaced as arts minister by [[Mitch Fifield]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', 20 September 2015, [http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/cabinet-reshuffle-artists-call-on-new-arts-minister-mitch-fifield-to-undo-the-damage-done-by-george-brandis-20150920-gjqvpk.html Cabinet reshuffle: artists call on new arts minister Mitch Fifield to 'undo the damage' done by George Brandis]&lt;/ref&gt; In November Fifield gave back $8 million a year for four years to Australia Council, changed the NPEA to the '''Catalyst Fund''', and stressed it would have a focus on smaller arts projects. The arts community was not impressed by the changes.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', 20 November 2015, [http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/rebranding-brandis-arts-fund-catalyst-wont-kill-off-national-program-for-excellence-in-the-arts-20151120-gl42nv.html Rebranding Brandis arts fund Catalyst won't kill off National Program for Excellence in the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 20 February, 2016, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-20/$105m-budget-cut-caught-australia-council-by-surprise:-emails/7185900?pfmredir=sm Australia Council budget cuts blindsided peak arts body's executive, documents show]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the reduced funding, Australia Council cancelled project funding rounds for small groups and individuals in 2015 and then cut funding to over 60 arts organisations across the country in May 2016. 

In addition, Education Minister [[Simon Birmingham]] indicated that the government is considering cutting funding to students who wish to undertake creative arts training, saying that he believes training in the creative arts is a ‘lifestyle’ choice and cannot lead to a satisfactory career or any economic outcome, and that he intends to cut loan support for students to undertake this form of education and training, cutting loans for over 50 arts training programs, including programs in ceramics, photography, dance, acting, animation, all forms of design, circus, music, film, fashion and journalism.&lt;ref name=NoMinister/&gt;

== Dancing Diablo Studio ==
Ramos decided to open the studio in January 2002, a few months after September 11, in the midst of a recession in New York.  By April she had a six figure contract with [[4Kids TV]]. "Brooklyn, New York is the home of a newly formed animation studio called Dancing Diablo. The studio set up shop in January 2002, and has already taken on some high profile projects, including work on Fox Kids' upcoming series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leigh|first1=Godfrey|title=Dancing Diablo Studio Gets Fired Up|url=http://www.awn.com/news/dancing-diablo-studio-gets-fired|agency=Animation World Network|publisher=AWN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramos and her business partner Diego Sanchez decided to open a sister office in Caracas, Venezuela in 2005.

As creative director of the studio, she is responsible for the fresh and original style that characterizes Dancing Diablo. Ramos&amp;nbsp;has directed more than a hundred commercials and short films for TV and the web. Her work has been recognized at prestigious festivals around the world, including [[Ottawa International Animation Film Festival]], [[Anima mundi]] Animation Festival in Brazil, [[ASIFA-East Animation Festival]] in New York, and  [[Pictoplasma]] Character Festival in Berlin, among others. "Cheesy Breadville", a short film Ramos&amp;nbsp;directed for [[PBS]] was recognized as one of the best short films of all time at the [[New York International Children's Film Festival]]. In 2009 Dancing Diablo got an Emmy recognition for its contribution to the [[Emmy Award]] winning program [[Between the Lions]], a children’s literacy TV series broadcast by [[PBS Kids]].

Ramos'&amp;nbsp;work as a color and animation expert has been mentioned in several books including "Color: Messages and Meanings" by [[Leatrice Eiseman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leatrice|first1=Eiseman|title=Color - Messages &amp; Meanings: A PANTONE Color Resource|publisher=North Light Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ziZKhxp2teEC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=Leatrice+Eiseman+dancing+diablo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hrbUj5ykXL&amp;sig=j0MGZbXKVkR3pjW0pu6GKeFdQAk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy0MD5reDSAhWF24MKHQaBDhwQ6AEIOTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Leatrice%20Eiseman%20beatriz%20helena%20ramos&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Becoming a Digital Designer: A Guide to Careers in Web, Video, Broadcast" By Steven Heller &amp; David Womack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steven|first1=Heller|title=Becoming a Digital Designer: A Guide to Careers in Web, Video, Broadcast .|publisher=Wiley|url=https://books.google.com/booksid=3eJwNvHf8msC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=dancing+diablo+animation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pOk2uaIvqJ&amp;sig=Y_9crnaajcMFFOeAaLgw2kSYV1U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjws6ys697SAhUMlxQKHSNRBLQ4ChDoAQgZMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dancing%20diablo%20animation&amp;f=false|ref=An interview with Beatriz Ramos, founder of Dancing Diablo, New York.}}&lt;/ref&gt;“Total Animation” by Judith Salavetz and Spencer Drate and "Your Career in Animation" By David B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5095">'''Book folding''' is the stage of the [[book]] production process in which the [[page (paper)|page]]s of the book are folded after [[printing]] and before [[bookbinding|binding]].&lt;ref name=Fleming&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Book in Canada|editor=Patricia Lockhart Fleming and Yvan Lamonde|chapter=The Binding Trades|author=Patricia Lockhart Fleming|pages=101|volume=2: 1840–1918|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2004|isbn= 978-0-8020-8012-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the middle of the 19th century, book folding was done by hand, and was a trade.  In the 1880s and 1890s, book folding machines by Brown and Dexter came onto the market, and by the 1910s hand-folding was rare, with one publisher declaring them to be "practically obsolete" in 1914.&lt;ref name=Fleming /&gt;

The folding process is also necessary to produce print products other than books—for instance mailings, magazines, leaflets etc.
==Hand folding==
{{empty section|date=August 2018}}

==Folding machines==
{{main|folding machine}}
Two main types of mechanisms are commonly employed in [[folding machine]]s: '''buckle folders''' and '''knife folders'''.&lt;ref name="ip"&gt;{{cite web |title=Folding |website=International Paper Knowledge Center |publisher=International Paper Company |url=http://glossary.ippaper.com/default.asp?req=knowledge/article/213 |access-date=7 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515035954/http://glossary.ippaper.com/default.asp?req=knowledge%2Farticle%2F213 |archive-date=15 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicole Howard|title=The book: the life story of a technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WwdMJKXzhEC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=8 January 2012|date=September 2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33028-5|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GonnellaNavetta2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rose Gonnella|author2=Christopher J. Navetta|title=Comp It Up: A Studio Skills Foundation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTvDQgijeSkC&amp;pg=SA3-PA74|accessdate=8 January 2012|date=2 July 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4283-2235-6|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buckle folder===
In a '''buckle folder''', the paper is first passed through 2 spinning rollers, which feed the paper into a pair of guide plates that redirect the paper at a slight angle, bending the paper. At the far end of the guide plates is a "paper stop". As the rollers continue to spin, the paper continues to slide in between the guides until it hits the paper stop, then, having nowhere else to go, buckles at the interface between the rollers and the angled guides. As the rollers continue to spin, the buckle increases, until it is eventually caught by a pair of "nip" rollers, which pull the buckle in and compresses and flattens it into a neat crease.

Adjusting the paper stop in a buckle folder determines where the fold will be placed. Also, a buckle folder may contain only 3 rollers, with one shared by both the input rollers and the nip rollers.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;

Although buckle folders are fast, simple, efficient, and have small folding tolerances, they are not suitable for substrate of very low (&lt;40g/m²) or very heavy paper grammage (&gt;120g/m²).{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Knife folder===
In a '''knife folder''', a sheet of paper is fed horizontally over 2 unpowered rollers until it hits a paper stop, at which point a dull blade pushes down on the paper and in between the 2 rollers to create the fold.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;

Although the knife folder is slower than buckle folders, it is more precise&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt; and can handle extreme grammages very well.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} It also has small folding tolerances, but is a more complex machine.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Folding variants==
[[File:Folding.svg|thumb|300px|
{{ordered list
| Letter Fold / C-Fold / Tri-Fold
| Tri-Fold / Gate Fold
| Double Gate Fold / Roll Fold
| Z-Fold / Accordion (6-page)
| Double Fold / Double Parallel Fold
| French Fold / Double Right-Angle Fold
}}&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;
]]

===Parallel folds===
Folding a paper more than once in the same direction (i.e. with parallel creases) is called '''parallel folding'''. Common examples of this are the '''half fold''', '''letter fold''', '''gate fold''', and '''Z-fold'''.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;

===Cross folds===
A '''cross fold''' is when a paper is folded once, then rotated [[90 degrees]] and folded again. The creases therefore cross each other at right angles. The most basic cross fold is the '''French fold''', or '''right-angle fold'''. Other examples include the '''16-page broadside''' and the '''12-page letter'''.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;

'''Burnishing''' is a form of [[pottery]] treatment in which the surface of the pot is [[Polishing|polished]], using a hard smooth surface such as a wooden or bone spatula, smooth stones, plastic, or even glass bulbs, while it still is in a leathery 'green' state, i.e., before [[Pottery#Firing|firing]]. After firing, the surface is extremely shiny. Often the whole outer surface of the pot is thus decorated, but in certain [[ceramic]] traditions there is 'pattern burnishing' where the outside and, in the case of open bowls, the inside, are decorated with burnished patterns in which some areas are left [[Gloss (paint)|matte]].

This technique can be applied to [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete masonry]], creating a polished [[Surface finishing|finish]]. 

Burnishing can also be applied to wood, by rubbing two pieces together along the [[Wood grain|grain]]. Hard woods take the treatment best.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Burnishing does not protect the wood like a [[varnish]] does, but does impart a glossy sheen.

If one wood has a [[dye]] in it or is colored in some way, it may rub off onto the other wood. Burnishing can also apply to [[relief printing]].

'''''Butch Jamie''''' is a [[gender-bending]] comedy film that premiered in July 2007 at [[Outfest]]: the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. Writer, director, and lead actress [[Michelle Ehlen]] won Outfest's Grand Jury Award for "Outstanding Actress in a Feature Film."&lt;ref name="Butch Jamie"&gt;[http://www.butchjamie.com Butch Jamie&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The film was produced independently through the filmmaker's production company, Ballet Diesel Films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balletdiesel.com Ballet Diesel Films&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film follows the story of Jamie, a struggling [[Butch and femme|butch]] [[lesbian]] actress who gets cast as a man in a film. The main plot is a romantic comedy between Jamie's male [[alter-ego]], "Male Jamie," and Jill, a [[heterosexual]] woman on set. The film's [[subplot]]s include Jamie's [[bisexual]] roommate Lola and her cat actor Howard, Lola's abrasive [[Butch and femme|butch]] German girlfriend Andi, and Jamie's [[gay]] Asian friend David.&lt;ref name="Butch Jamie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaywired.com/article.cfm?section=67&amp;id=15594 GayWired.com - Outfest Days Eight &amp; Nine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedic elements==
Butch Jamie utilizes [[deadpan]] [[humor]] through [[slapstick]], [[irony]], and [[satire]]. The film incorporates elements of slapstick physical comedy along with the [[irony]] of Jamie entering into a "[[heterosexual]]" relationship with an unknowing woman. As a [[satire]], the film pokes fun at [[gender roles]], social assumptions, [[stereotypes]], and the politics of [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]].&lt;ref name="welcome to dykediva.com"&gt;[http://www.dykediva.com/movies/pulley_jamie.php welcome to dykediva.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Out Chicago: A wider stance"&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/chicago/article/lgbt/24048/a-wider-stance Time Out Chicago: A wider stance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lesbianation.com"&gt;[http://www.lesbianation.com/article.cfm?section=2&amp;id=17069 LesbiaNation - Butch Jaime’s Michelle Ehlen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In addition to [[gender roles]] and [[stereotypes]], the film also [[satirizes]] the [[movie industry]].&lt;ref name="Time Out Chicago: A wider stance"/&gt; This is reflected not only through Jamie's adventures, but also through Howard, the cat actor who Jamie has projected her competitive drive onto.&lt;ref name="welcome to dykediva.com"/&gt; Howard's owner, Lola, takes the cat's career very seriously, complete with professional [[head shots]] and a [[Showreel (actors)|demo reel]].

==Representation of butch women onscreen==
While it's common to see comedies where men pose as women, female to male comedies are much less prominent. While the film is said to be a lesbian version of ''[[Tootsie]]'',&lt;ref name="Time Out Chicago: A wider stance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid47385.asp Outfest 2007 | Film | Advocate.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losangelesjournal.com/new/articles-view-3-424 Los Angeles Journal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the fact that it highlights a [[Butch and femme|butch]] actress marks it as unique. Jamie's stereotypical butch [[masculinity]], [[sarcasm]], and cockiness are rarely seen in such prominence in female actors on-screen. Unlike [[Dustin Hoffman]] in ''[[Tootsie]]'', Jamie's career problems are not the result of a [[character flaw]], but from a flaw in the way women are chosen to be represented.

==Sequel==
Writer/director/actor [[Michelle Ehlen]] is developing a [[sequel]] called ''Heterosexual Jill''. While ''Butch Jamie'' is a [[satire]] on [[gender]], Ehlen proposes to have the sequel be a satire on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].&lt;ref name="lesbianation.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balletdiesel.com/development In Development&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
*2007: Grand Jury Award for "Outstanding Actress in a Feature Film" to Michelle Ehlen at LA [[Outfest]]
*2007: Jury Award for "Best Female Feature" at [[Long Island Gay and Lesbian Film Festival]]
*2007: Jury Award for "Best Dramatic Feature" at [[Chicago Gay and Lesbian International Film Festival]]
*2008: Special mention at [[Barcelona International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival]]

[[File:Carimate Chair Vico Magistretti Cassina Austin Calhoon Photograph.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Carimate Chair designed by Vico Magistretti in 1959 and produced by Cassina]]
The "Amedeo Cassina" company was created by the brothers Cesare and Umberto Cassina in 1927 in [[Meda, Lombardy|Meda]], [[Brianza]], (Northern [[Italy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/cesare-cassina/ |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |title=Cassina, Cesare |publisher=Treccani}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Cassina continued to expand in size and fame, with products which covered a broad range of furniture including: chairs, armchairs, tables, sofas and beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architonic.com/pmabt/cassina/3100029 |title=Cassina Profile |publisher=Architonic |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company's transformation was bolstered further by commissions for cruise ships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=1kRJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=cruise+ships+Cassina&amp;dq=cruise+ships+Cassina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IkPBVNR20bbIBIyggcgN&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |title=Abitare |page=165 |publisher=Editrice Segesta |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ekJQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=cruise+ships+Cassina&amp;dq=cruise+ships+Cassina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IkPBVNR20bbIBIyggcgN&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |page=94 |title=Custom-built: the concept of unique in Italian design |author=Silvana Annicchiarico |publisher=Charta |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; top end hotels and restaurants which accounted for a great part of the company's activity right up to the mid-sixties and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |page=6 |url=http://www.pfgroupcontract.com/uploads/object31/File/CASSINA%20CUSTOM%20INTERIORS.pdf |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |title=AN INTRODUCTION TO CASSINA CONTRACT DIVISION}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 the "Cassina I Maestri" (Cassina Masters) Collection was born, with the acquisition of the rights to products designed by [[Le Corbusier]], Pierre Jeanneret and Charlotte Perriand, the most important names of 20th century design.

The "Cassina I Maestri" collection was widened in 1968 with the acquisition from Bauhaus-Archiv in Berlin of reproduction rights to some of the Bauhaus objects and in 1971 the designs of [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.palermotoday.it/economia/inaugurazione-cassina-arredamenti-palermo.html |language=Italian |publisher=Palermo Today |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |title=Cassina inaugura un nuovo branded space a Palermo |date=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Masters collection continued with the re-issue in 1983 of furniture by Erik Gunner Asplund, the acquisition from the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation of rights of reproduction (1986) of furniture by Frank Lloyd Wright, including the Barrel chair (1937), and, finally, in 2004 furniture by [[Charlotte Perriand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interioresminimalistas.com/2014/12/09/la-historia-de-cassina-y-el-diseno-traves-de-18-emblematica-sillas/ |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |publisher=Interiores Minimalistas |date=December 9, 2014 |title=La historia de Cassina y el diseño a través de una exposición con 18 de sus emblemáticas sillas |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sillas de diseño|url=http://www.vackart.es/29-sillas-de-diseno|publisher=www.vackart.es|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cirque d'Été''' (Summer Circus), a former Parisian equestrian theatre (and a type of indoor [[hippodrome]]), was built in 1841&lt;ref&gt;McCormick 1993, p. 31, says the theatre was built in 1841; Lock 1860, p. 99, says it was built in 1843.&lt;/ref&gt; to designs by the architect [[Jacques Hittorff]]. It was used as the summer home of the Théâtre Franconi, the equestrian troupe of the [[Cirque Olympique]], the license for which had been sold in 1836 to Louis Dejean by [[Adolphe Franconi]], the grandson of its founder, [[Antonio Franconi]].&lt;ref name=McCormick31&gt;McCormick 1993, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The cirque was later also used for other purposes, including grand concerts conducted by [[Hector Berlioz]]. 

The new theatre was located on the north-east side of the present Rond-Point of the [[Champs-Élysées]]. At first called the '''Cirque National''',&lt;ref name=Galignani1846&gt;Galignani 1846, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YJotAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA439#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 439]; Galignani 1852, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FlY1kVUhX8YC&amp;pg=PA495#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 495].&lt;/ref&gt; it also became known as the '''Cirque des Champs-Élysées''' and the '''Cirque Olympique des Champs-Élysées'''.&lt;ref name=Holoman&gt;Holoman 1989, pp. 315–319.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 it was renamed '''Cirque de l'Impératrice''' (in honor of the new [[Empress Eugénie]]), a name which it retained until the fall of the empire in 1870.

The cirque on the Champs-Élysées should not be confused with the same company's winter theatre, the [[Cirque Olympique (boulevard du Temple)|Cirque Olympique]] on the [[Boulevard du Temple]], which had opened in 1827,&lt;ref&gt;Galignani 1827, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PlXK0Ev8pHsC&amp;pg=PA657#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 657].&lt;/ref&gt; or with the company's later winter theatre, the Cirque Napoléon (on the rue des Filles Calvaires), also built for Louis Dejean and opened in 1852.&lt;ref name=Lock&gt;Lock 1860, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6RlcAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 99].&lt;/ref&gt; The latter theatre dropped the name Cirque Napoléon in 1870 and became primarily known as the [[Cirque d'Hiver]] (Winter Circus).&lt;ref name=Galignani1884&gt;Galignani 1884, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lKoMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 235].&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre on the Champs-Élysées was demolished in 1902.&lt;ref name=Steel&gt;Steel 1979, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zEqkHGCobCEC&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 115].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and design==

In 1836 Louis Dejean, the owner of the Cirque Olympique on the boulevard du Temple, obtained an additional license for a summer tent-circus at the Carré Marigny on the Champs-Élysées.&lt;ref&gt;The grand-daughter of Dejean, Alice (Berlin 1852 - Paris 1901) would marry [[Emmanuel Chabrier]] in 1873. Delage, Roger. ''Emmanuel Chabrier.'' Paris, Fayard, 1999, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; This was replaced in 1841&lt;ref name=McCormick31/&gt; by a polygonal stone edifice with 16 sides. A pedimented porch on the east side was surmounted with a bronze equestrian statue designed by  [[James Pradier|Pradier]], and panels on the other sides sported ornamental bas-relief horses' heads designed by [[Francisque Joseph Duret|Duret]] and [[Astyanax-Scévola Bosio|Bosio]]. The theatre was spacious and held as many as 4,000 to 6,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Holoman 1989, p. 316, says the theatre had a capacity of 6,000 spectators; Lock 1860, p. 99, says it was 4,000.&lt;/ref&gt; To the north was a rectangular building which included the stables. The interior was decorated in a Moorish style,and the roof was supported by light iron columns. The ceiling was decorated with compartments enclosing equestrian figures, and a chandelier with 130 gas jets hung over the center of the performance ring, which was surrounded by sixteen rows of seats.&lt;ref name="Galignani1846"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lock"/&gt; The [[Stadium seating|stadium-style seating]] was "raked so sharply that those who wished might admire the costumes of fashionable women from head to toe."&lt;ref&gt;Holoman 1989, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berlioz concerts==
[[File:Berlioz concert at the Cirque Olympique des Champs-Élysées 1845 - Gallica.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Berlioz conducting a grand concert at the Cirque Olympiqe on the Champs-Élysées (January 1845)]]

The director of the theatre, a man by the name of Gallois, soon installed heating, and, being aware of the great success of the monster concert presented by [[Hector Berlioz]] at the nearby [[Palais de l'Industrie|Festival de l'Industrie]] during the summer of 1844, engaged the composer for a series of six grand concerts to be presented at the Cirque that winter on Sunday afternoons, a day when no competing ones would be given at the [[Paris Conservatoire]]. The contract stipulated that Berlioz would hire and rehearse the orchestra and chorus, select the music, and conduct the performances.&lt;ref name=Cairns306&gt;Cairns 1999, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlioz engaged 350 players and singers for the concerts&lt;ref name=Holoman/&gt; and held sectional rehearsals at the [[Salle Herz]]. Fortunately, Gallois underwrote all the costs.&lt;ref name=Cairns306/&gt;

The first concert on 19 January 1845 included Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|"Emperor" Concerto]] with [[Charles Hallé]] as the piano soloist, excerpts from Gluck's operas ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]'' and ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orphée]]'', as well as works by Berlioz, including the overture ''[[Le carnaval romain]]'', ''La tour de Nice'' (the original version of the overture ''Le corsaire''), and the "Dies irae" and "Tuba mirum" from his requiem mass, the ''[[Requiem (Berlioz)|Grande Messe des morts]]''. The latter two excerpts were played at the conclusion of all the concerts.&lt;ref name=Holoman/&gt;

The second concert on 16 February had the theme ''séance orientale'', in keeping with the decoration of the hall. The program included [[Félicien David]]'s symphonic ode ''[[Le désert]]'', the Austrian "lion-pianist" Léopold de Meyer playing his ''Marche marocaine'', Op. 22 (subtitled "War-song of the Turks"), and Berlioz's overture to ''[[Les francs-juges]]''. Apparently, Meyer's ''Marche'' "electrified the audience, and was furiously encored."&lt;ref&gt;Holomon 1989, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third concert on 16 March was organized around the theme ''séance russe''. There was music by the Russian composer [[Mikhail Glinka]], who was in Paris at the time and attended the concerts, which included excerpts from his opera ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' and a ballet from his opera ''[[Russlan and Ludmilla]]''. The finale from Berlioz's dramatic symphony ''[[Roméo et Juliette (Berlioz)|Roméo et Juliette]]'' had a Russian [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] singing the role of Friar Laurence. The concert also included ''L'invitation à la valse'', Berlioz's orchestration of Carl Maria von Weber's piano piece ''[[Invitation to the Dance (Weber)|Invitation to the Dance]]'' (which Berlioz had inserted as part of the ballet in his edition of Weber's opera ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' prepared for a production at the [[Paris Opera]] in 1841).&lt;ref&gt;Holoman 1989, pp. 618; Cairns 1999, pp. 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently Glinka was quite pleased with the music he heard by Berlioz: he soon departed on a trip to Spain planning to compose ''fantaisies pittoresque'' in the style of Berlioz.&lt;ref name=Holoman/&gt;

[[File:Handbill for Berlioz concert of 6 April 1845 at the Cirque Olympique des Champs-Élysées - Holoman 1989p318.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Handbill for the concert on 6 April 1845]]

The fourth program on 6 April was billed as a ''séance Berlioz'' and included the overture from Weber's ''Freischütz'', excerpts from Berlioz's symphonies ''[[Harold en Italie]]'' and ''Roméo et Juliette'', and Quasimodo's aria with chorus from [[Louise Bertin]]'s opera ''[[La Esmeralda (opera)|La Esmeralda]]'' sung by the tenor [[Jean-Étienne-Auguste Massol]], who had created the role at the [[Paris Opera]] in 1836. (At the premiere the aria had made such a good impression that [[Alexandre Dumas]] had cried out "It's by Berlioz! It's by Berlioz!".&lt;ref&gt;Cairns 1999, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlioz denied that he had written any of the music, and only suggested an improvement to its ending.)&lt;ref&gt;Holoman 1989, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The concert also included the first performance of Berlioz's orchestration of Meyer's ''Marche marocaine''.&lt;ref&gt;Holoman 1989, pp. 317–318, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the first two concerts at the Cirque were well attended, the numbers quickly declined and the series closed after the fourth concert.&lt;ref name=Holoman/&gt; The location, not a popular spot in the wintertime, was probably partly to blame, as were the acoustics of the hall, which was too reverberant.&lt;ref&gt;Cairns 1999, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ticket prices of 5 francs for the upper level and  10 francs for the lower&lt;ref&gt;Holoman 1989, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; were significantly higher than the 1 and 2 francs typically charged for an equestrian show.&lt;ref name=Galignani1846/&gt;

Berlioz was later to write in his memoirs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I do not remember what terms we agreed on; I know only that it turned out badly for him [Gallois]. The takings of the four concerts, for which we had engaged five hundred performers, were inevitably insufficient to cover all the cost of such huge forces. Once again the place was quite unsuitable for music. This time the sound reverberated so slowly in that heart-breaking rotunda that compositions of any complexity gave rise to the most horrid confusions of harmony. Only one piece was really effective and that was the Dies irae from my Requiem. Its breadth of tempo and harmonic movement made it seem less incongruous than any of the others in those booming cathedral-like spaces. It scored such a success that we had to include it in the programme of every concert.&lt;ref&gt;Berlioz; Cairns 2002, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later history==
[[File:Poster for the Cirque d'Été 1887 'La femme Mélinite' - Gallica.jpg|thumb|left|Poster for "La femme Mélinite" (1887)]]

The Cirque d'Été typically had relatively inexpensive ticket prices. In 1846, 1852, and 1862, spectators were paying 1 franc for the upper level seating and 2 francs for the lower.&lt;ref name=Galignani1846/&gt;&lt;ref name=Galignani1862&gt;Galignani 1862, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFsQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA471#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 471].&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre reached its apogee during the [[Second French Empire]] under the name Cirque de l'Impératrice&lt;ref name=Galignani1862/&gt; (1853–1870), after which it became known as the Cirque d'Été or the Cirque des Champs-Élysées.&lt;ref name=Galignani1884/&gt;&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; Its big attraction for a long time was the [[clown]] [[Jean-Baptiste Auriol]] (1808–1881). [[La Belle Otero]] and [[Émilienne d'Alençon]] also made their debuts there.

Hittorf also designed a similar theatre, the Cirque Napoléon on the rue des Filles Calvaires which opened in 1852 and was renamed [[Cirque d'Hiver]] (Winter Circus) in 1870. The Cirque d'Été was only open in the summer from 1 May to 30 October, and the Cirque d'Hiver ran from 1 November to 30 April.&lt;ref name=Black&gt;Black 1874, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v1QDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 78]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cirque d'Été's success continued into the 1880s. Many Parisians visited on Saturdays, and it was considered chic.&lt;ref&gt;In his novel ''Noris, mœurs du jours'', [[Jules Claretie]] describes an evening at the Cirque national in 1883: "Par la découpure géométrique de l'entrée, le cirque apparaissait sous la clarté de ses lustres, le fouillis de ses têtes, les caresses des toilettes claires, des cravates blanches, des éventails rouges, les scintillements de quelque parure envoyant des éclairs parfois, comme si, çà et là, dans cette foule, fut tombé quelque goutte de diamant..." (cited by Andrée Jacob and Jean-Marc Léri, ''Vie et histoire du VIIIe arrondissement'', Paris, Éditions Hervas, 1991, p. 33)&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest waned after the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|exposition universelle de 1889]]. It was demolished after 1900 (most likely in 1902)&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; and gave its name to the [[rue du Cirque]].

'''ContainerArt''' is an itinerant public art event. The event uses shipping containers to display works of contemporary art. To date, the events took place in [[Italy]] and in some international cities. In Italy events have been held in [[Bergamo]] (2005) with 21 containers, [[Varese]] (2005) with 21 containers, [[Genova]] (2007) with 24 containers, [[Rome]] (2007) with 14 containers, [[Milano]] (2008) 6 containers, [[Torino]](2008) 2 containers, [[Casale Monferrato]] (2008) 4 containers, [[Genova]] (2008) in co-production with [https://web.archive.org/web/20080628052823/http://www.kmfa.gov.tw/eng/home.htm the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts]. The event, named "Ecosystems" included 26 containers spread around the port city, 14 of which part of the Kaohsiung Container Arts biennale and shipped to Genova directly from [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taiwan]]. In the fall of 2008 a simultaneous ContainerArt event in 4 cities was held under the name: "Beauty Inside Will Save the World": 4 containers in Milano, 4 in Torino, 4 in [[Venice]] (Mestre) and 1 container in [[Tirana]] in [[Albania]]. Internationally, ContainerArt has also held events in [[New York City]] (2006) with 8 containers in co-production with DIVA fair, and in [[Jerusalem]] (2007) with 3 containers and in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]] under the leadership of Daniel Roesler and the curatorship of Lucas Bambozzi and Cao Guimares. The São Paulo event consisted of a temporary container museum structure assembled by the architectural firm of Bernardes &amp; Jacobson and open to the public in Parque Villa Lobos between Nov 18 and 28, 2008. The temporary museum hosted exclusively contemporary video-art. In 2009, 2010, 2011 the event was also featured at the Pacific National Exhibit through a temporary container museum structure designed and managed by Peter Male. ContainerArt is now involved in artist exchanges among its international partners.

==Latest event==
The latest ContainerArt events was held in [[Edmonton]], Canada in 2011: a temporary museum structure positioned at the Capital Ex fair in Northlands from July 21 to July 31. The artists involved:

Nina Haggerty Centre for the Arts, iHuman Youth Society, Patti Matty, Jennifer Rae Forsyth, Monika Blichar, Colin Vince, Tyler Sherard, Michael Coolidge

==Event experience==

ContainerArt events usually last for 10 days during which the container is open to the public. Containers are placed in the streets, and in public parks of a city. Maps are distributed so that visitors can explore unusual neighbourhoods and places through art. ContainerArt also places "bStrogs" or street blogs outside the open containers. Computers connected to the Internet are sometimes used to comment upon the work. ContainerArt also makes use of Bluetooth technologies to communicate information on the works and events to the passerby's cell phones. Since 2008 ContainerArt has focused on the creation of temporary museum structures made out of containers.

==Organization and curator==

The event is produced by the Associazione Cuturale ContainerArt, an Italian non-profit association headed by Ronald Lewis Facchinetti. Facchinetti's curatorial philosophy is described in his book "Beauty Inside", and it is primarily concerned with helping the viewer achieve the "aesthetic experience" while isolated inside a container and in front of the work of art. ContainerArt also operates as an international franchise with partners in various countries, including Brazil, China, Canada and Israel.

==Partners==

ContainerArt has a Content Partner philosophy by which some containers are curated by institutions, museums or associations. Past content partners include [http://www.Gamec.it Gamec], [http://www.festivalpoesia.org Festival Internazionale di Poesia][http://www.zoneattive.it Zoneattive], [http://www.Premioceleste.it Premio Celeste] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080603181640/http://www.oyoyoy.it/ Oyoyoy! Festival].

==Selection process==

ContainerArt projects that are not curated by content partners are directly chosen by Ronald Lewis Facchinetti in association with local co-curators or franchisees. Any artist can apply by sending a project and filling out an application available on the ContainerArt website.

Artists exhibit for free. Artists whose project is approved are assigned a container in which to exhibit their work.
The event allows them to display their project in an unusual context with wide access to the general population of a city.

'''Cultural depictions of dogs''' extend back thousands of years to when [[dog]]s were portrayed on the walls of caves. Representations of dogs in art became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed. [[Hunting]] scenes were popular in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, watchfulness, and love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incredibleart.org/lessons/middle/animals2.htm|title=Animal Symbolism in Many Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As dogs became more domesticated, they were shown as companion animals, often painted sitting on a lady's lap. Throughout the [[art history]] there is an overwhelming presence of dogs as status symbols and pets in painting mainly in the [[Western art]].  The dogs were brought to houses and were allowed to live in the house and cherished as part of the family, and were regarded as mostly in the upper classes who used them for hunting and could afford to feed them. Hunting dogs were generally connected to the aristocracy. Only the nobility were allowed to keep hunting dogs, and this would signal status, and it was the signalment of a noble man. Dog portraits became increasingly popular in the 18th century, and the establishment of [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK in 1873 and the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884 introduced [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standards]] or 'word pictures', which further encouraged the popularity of dog portraiture.

[[File:Chou Fang 003.jpg|thumb|Court ladies playing with a small dog, ''Beauties Wearing Flowers'' by [[Tang Dynasty]] painter [[Zhou Fang (Tang Dynasty)|Zhou Fang]]]]
The walls of caves and tombs dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] have illustrations or statues of dogs. These generally portray dogs used for hunting, and even children's toys and ceramics depicting dogs.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog|url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-15457|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the prehistoric paintings are found in [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]], these paintings depict dog on a [[leash]] with a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sacred Animals of India|page=101|first=Nanditha|last=Krishna|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock art of [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] also include depiction of dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost History of the Canine Race: Our 15,000-year Love Affair with Dogs|first=Mary Elizabeth|last=Thurston|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Enduring Treasures: National Parks of the World|publisher=National Geographic Society|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Ancient Greeks and Romans, contrary to the Semitic cultures  favored dogs as pets, and valued them for their faithfulness and courage and were often seen on Greek and Roman reliefs and ceramics as symbols of fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/CJ/44/4/Household_Pets*.html|title=Greek and Roman Household Pets |publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats were not favoured over dogs, on contrary Ancient Greeks and Romans didn't keep cats as pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyforkids.net/greek-pets.html|title=Greek pets|publisher=historyforkids.net|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs were given as gifts among lovers and kept them as both  pets, status symbols or kept for guardians and as hunting dogs. Dogs were appreciated by the Greek for their faith and love. [[Homeros]] [[Odyssey]] tells the story of [[Odysseus]] who had a dog called Argos he raised and who was the only one that recognized him when he returned  home after his travels, disguised to conceals his appearance. Only the old dog recognized him instantly. This theme has been often depicted in on ancient Greek vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/53-3/kitchell.pdf|title=Pets of Ancient Greeks|publisher=www.penn.museum|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Romans kept three types of dogs. Hunting dogs; especially [[sighthound]]s, Molossus type of dogs like the [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]  were often depicted in  reliefs and mosaics with the words Cave Canem; and small companion dogs of [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]] type as women's [[lap dog]]s. Greyhounds were often depicted too, often as sculptures. Large dogs were often used in war by the Roman army  in attack formations or for wolf-hunting on horseback,  which was a popular sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societasviaromana.net/Collegium_VitaQuotidiana/pets.php|title=Pets in Ancient Rome

Generally, dogs symbolize [[faith]] and loyalty.&lt;ref name="Hall1979"&gt;{{citation|last=Hall|first=James|title=Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLjd0fyT0_IC|year=1979|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=978-0-06-430100-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dog, when included in an [[allegory|allegorical]] painting, portrays the attribute of [[fidelity]] personified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a portrait of a married couple, a dog placed in a woman's lap or at her feet can represent marital fidelity. If the portrait is of a widow, a dog can represent her continuing faithfulness to the memory of her late husband.&lt;ref name="Hall1979" /&gt;

An example of a dog representing marital fidelity is present in Jan van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]''. An oil painting on [[oak]] [[Panel painting|panel]] dated 1434 by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Jan van Eyck]], it is a small full-length double portrait,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky]] published an article entitled ''Jan van Eyck's 'Arnolfini' Portrait'' in the ''[[Burlington Magazine]] 1934&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed to represent the Italian merchant [[Giovanni Arnolfini|Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini]] and his wife,&lt;ref&gt;Stockstad Cothren&lt;/ref&gt; presumably in their home in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] city of [[Bruges]]. It portrays a wedding scene, where the people invited to witness the ceremony can be seen in the convex mirror at the back, the mirror symbolizing the eye of God. In those times people were not always married in the church, it was enough that two witnesses were present to make a wedding legal. A number of symbols can be found in the picture: the fruit, the symbol of fertility and wealth, the shoes removed (this is a holy place), and the dog. The oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may have been one of the items dealt in by Arnolfini. The little dog symbolizes in the Middle Ages [[iconography]]  faithfulness, devotion or [[loyalty]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  or can be seen as an emblem of [[lust]], signifying the couple's desire to have a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jan Van Eyck: The Play of Realism|pages=20–50|first=Craig|last=Harbison|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the couple, the dog looks out to meet the gaze of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig, ''Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism'', Reaktion Books, London, 1991, {{ISBN|0-948462-18-3}} pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;  The dog could also be simply a lap dog, a gift from husband to wife. Many wealthy women in the court had lap dogs as companions. In that case the dog could reflect wealth or social status.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig, "Sexuality and social standing in Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini double portrait", ''Renaissance Quarterly'', volume 43, issue 2, p. 270, Summer 1990, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2862365 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunting scenes===
[[File:Livre de Chasse 40v.jpg|thumb|left|''Livre de Chasse'', French hunting dog book]]

Hunting scenes were common topics in medieval and Renaissance art. Hunting in the medieval period was a sport exclusive to the aristocracy and hunting was an essential part of court etiquette. Depictions of person together with a hunting dog, hawks or falcons would signal status, or was the signalment of a noble man - since the hunting dogs were  connected to aristocracy, and only the nobility was hunting. Hunting was considered as a sport, but also a way of showing bravery, chivalric virtue while hunting dangerous prey such as wild boars and bears. Hunting dogs allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt. Different breeds of dogs were used for different types of hunting. Hunting with dogs was so popular that during the Middle Ages the wild bears had already been hunted to extinction in England.
[[File:ST. Eustachius.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Pisanello]] (1395–1455), hunting scene with dogs (''The Vision of St. Eustachius'')]]
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture, hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply. Hunting filled also a practical necessity, assuring food for the tables of the nobility. Nobles spending their money on packs of specially bred hounds were not unusual.

[[Gaston III, Count of Foix|Gaston Phoebus]] (30 April 1331 – 1391) wrote a manual on hunting and there are several tapestries from the period which depict hunting scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medieval and renaissance hunting|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/m/med-ren-hunting/|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if nobility was hunting, hunting has been forbidden to servants, peasants and also the Roman Catholic Church [[cleric]]s. Thus the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'' (C. ii, X, De cleric. venat.) says, "We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons." The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], held under [[Pope Innocent III]], decreed (canon xv): "We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics." The decree of the [[Council of Trent]] is worded more mildly: "Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking" (Sess. XXIV, De reform., c. xii), which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit, and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (''clamorosa'') hunting unlawful, but not quiet (''quieta'') hunting. Thus, hunting dogs are seldom seen depicted in the company of [[cleric]]s, but very often in the company of in the highest social class of that society.

=== In heraldry===

[[File:Coa Hungary Town Ebes.svg|thumb|120px|Coats of arms of the Hungarian town [[Ebes]]]]

For the same reason, depictions of dogs can be found in heraldry. In monarchies, the aristocracy are a class of people  who either possess hereditary titles granted by a monarch or are related to such people, and thanks to the specific connection of the aristocrats with the hunting dogs, dogs were often shown as symbols in heraldry. In the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], [[heraldry]] became a highly developed discipline. Dogs of various types, and occasionally of specific breeds, occur as [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] and [[supporter]]s in many [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], and often symbolise courage, vigilance, loyalty and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120304224608/http://www.scottish-wedding-dreams.com/heraldic-animals.html ~ Heraldry Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[encaustic tile]]s dating from the 15th century featured a white hound, the Talbot family crest and the inscription "Sir John Talbot" (the [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|1st Earl of Shrewsbury]]). Part of a set of four, the tiles were possibly originally used on a church floor. The term talbot is used in heraldry to refer to a good-mannered hunting dog. The [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot dog]] always depicts the Talbot [[coat of arms]] and is the original hound used as an English heraldic symbol. It is portrayed in the family arms of several noble German families and at least seven other English families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Waters |first=Nick |title=History of the Talbot tiles |url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/2223/Features/35-Waters-(2) |accessdate=18 January 2014 |newspaper=[[Dog World (newspaper)|Dog World]] |date=5 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MiPuGlGR?url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/2223/Features/35-Waters-%282%29 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th and 17th century==
[[File:Ofthedogingeneral.jpg|thumb|150px|A woodcut illustration from ''The history of four-footed beasts and serpents'' by [[Edward Topsell]], 1658]]
During the 16th and 17th century, dogs were depicted in hunting scenes, or depicted representing social status, as a lap dog, or sometimes as a personal friend. They may also used as symbols in painting. The Greek philosopher [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] (404-323 BC) was  depicted by Jean-Léon Gérôme, in the company of dogs that also served as emblems of his "Cynic" (Greek: "kynikos," dog-like) philosophy, which emphasized an austere existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shakespeare's Clown: Actor and Text in the Elizabethan Playhouse|page=155|first=David|last=Wiles|publisher=Cambridge university press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Plato, ''Republic'' Book II&lt;/ref&gt; Diogenes stated that  "Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth. Other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Diogenes of Sinope, quoted by Stobaeus, ''Florilegium'', iii. 13. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek philosopher is seated in his [[abode]], the earthenware tub, - also depicted sometimes in sitting in a [[barrel]], -  in the [[Metroon]], Athens, lighting the lamp in daylight with which he was to go in searching for an honest man.

Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh portrayed probably a scholar noted by its significance to its particular profession,  depicting a book, or a Protestant preacher and theologian with the Bible opened on the table. A dog depicted as a companion to the scholar is a symbol of [[fidelity]], vigilance and regularity in the research due to assigned to dogs natural intelligence and intuition, and the [[parrot]] is a symbol of erudition and [[eloquence]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/rudeness.htm "Logical Rudeness"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==

Netsuke are Japanese miniature sculptures of great artistic merit that were also serving a practical function as a storage place for kimomos that traditionally had no pockets. These small boxes had a carved, button-like toggle called a ''netsuke''. Most netsuke production was during around 1615&amp;ndash;1868, in the [[Edo period]] in Japan. Among others motifs, netsukes depicted even dogs. 
The tradition of showing dogs in hunting scenes continued through to the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Secord"&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian England|url=http://www.dogpainting.com/info_detail.cfm?type=referance&amp;info_name=VICTORIANENGLAND&amp;index=2|publisher=William Secord Gallery|accessdate=24 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113235416/http://www.dogpainting.com/info_detail.cfm?type=referance&amp;info_name=VICTORIANENGLAND&amp;index=2|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture entitled ''A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society'' depicts a dog that was well known in London at that time.  The dog depicted by Sir Edwin Landseer 1838, was a Newfoundland called "Bob", who was found in a shipwreck off the coast of England. The dog found his way to the London waterfront, where he became known for saving people from drowning, a total of twenty-three times over the course of fourteen years. For this, he was made a distinguished member of the [[Royal Humane Society]], granting him a medal and access to food.&lt;ref name=newfoundlandart&gt;{{cite web|title=The Newfoundland in Art &amp; Literature|url=http://www.ncanewfs.org/history/pages/landseer2.html|publisher=Newfoundland Club of America|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Newfoundlanders with white patches are now recognized as a breed of their own,  as a "[[Landseer (dog)|Landseer]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Story|first=George M.|title=Dictionary of Newfoundland English|year=1990|publisher=Univ. of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-8020-5887-4|page=344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrVbk3EndTcC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=%22A+Distinguished+Member+of+the+Humane+Society%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C61rTpmOOcu38QOQ4vEL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Distinguished%20Member%20of%20the%20Humane%20Society%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Victorian era, the mainly sporting tradition remained but after the establishment of [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK in 1873 and the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884 introduced [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standards]] or 'word pictures', dog portraits soared in popularity.&lt;ref name="Secord" /&gt; There were differences between the British and European style of depiction; William Secord, a world expert on canine art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog Art  A Muse to Artists and a Delight to Countless Viewers|url=http://www.ralphlaurenhome.com/design/art_gallery_guide/william_secord.aspx|publisher=Ralph Lauren Media|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; described it by stating: "Belgian, Dutch, Flemish and German artists were more influenced by realism, depicting the dog the way it really looked, with dirt on it’s coat and slobber and that kind of thing. You see Alfred Stevens, who's Belgian, do street dogs and dogs that are suffering, which in England you never see. British depictions were more idealized.

The prices achieved for canine art increased the 1980s–90s and started to gain popularity in established art circles rather than antique markets. Buyers can generally be divided into three dominant categories: hunters; breeders and exhibitors of pedigree dogs; and owners of companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silberman|first=Vanessa|title=Who Let the Dogs Out?|journal=Art Business News|date=May 2001|volume=28|issue=5|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-74628439/who-let-the-dogs-out|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dacii (The Dacians)''''' is a 1967 [[list of historical drama films|historical drama film]] about the run up to [[Domitian's Dacian War]], which was fought between the [[Roman empire]] and the [[Dacians]] in AD 87-88. The film mixes historical events with a fictional story about a Roman general who is the son of a Dacian spy.

The film was directed by [[Romania]]n director [[Sergiu Nicolaescu]]. It was released on 31 May 1967 in France. It was entered into the [[5th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow1967"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1967 |title=5th Moscow International Film Festival (1967) |accessdate=2012-12-09 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194759/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1967 |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Romania the film was immensely successful, and it remains one of the most watched films of all time in the country.

==Plot==
In a pre-credit sequence, a massive Roman army arrives at the gates of a Dacian town. The Roman envoy asks them to open the gates, promising them life and liberty. The guard on watch asks who is making this demand, and gets the reply "the masters of the world". He responds "You will be when we will die".

After the credits we see a Roman army commanded by [[Cornelius Fuscus|General Fuscus]] (Georges Marchal) arrayed at the Danube waiting for the right moment to attack Dacia. Fuscus and Roman senator Attius plot to kill the decadent emperor [[Domitian]], who has just arrived to take command. Attius's son Severus (Pierre Brice) is a subordinate commander under Fuscus. News arrives that the [[Marcomanni]] have risen in rebellion. Domitian decides to make a deal with the Dacians so he can use the army to suppress the rebellion. Attius is sent across the Danube with Severus and a small contingent of legionaries to negotiate. But as soon as he enters Dacian territory Attius is killed by a Dacian sentry. Severus returns to camp with his father's body, and Domitian orders an attack.

In Dacia Cotyso (Alexander Herescu) and Meda (Marie-José Nat), children of King [[Decebalus]] (Amza Pellea), are hunting in the Carpathian Mountains. When news arrives that Attius has been killed Decebalus makes the mysterious remark that he was "the only Roman who was not supposed to die". Decebalus reveals that Attius was really a Dacian called Zoltes, sent to Rome 40 years ago as part of a plan to promote Dacian interests. He had been supplied liberally with gold annually so that he could become influential in Roman politics and keep Decebalus informed of events in the capital. When he died he had been carrying a letter to Decebalus informing him of Roman plans and dispositions.

Decebalus orders an evacuation of the border province accompanied by delaying operations against the Romans. He sends a symbolic message to Domitian: a caged mouse, frog, bird, a knife and a quiver of arrows. The message is misinterpreted by the Romans as a sign of Dacian submission to Rome (the animals signifying the land, waters and air, all being handed over with the weapons). Severus is deputed to travel to the Dacian capital to receive Decebalus' surrender. When he gets there, Decebalus reveals to him the truth about his father Attius. He also tells him that the true meaning of the message was that the Dacians would fight to the end against invaders.

The Dacians prepare for war. According to ancestral custom, the bravest young warrior must be sacrificed to the Dacian god [[Zalmoxis]] to win his favour. Since the king's son Cotyso won a contest of athletic and martial skill, he has been given the honour of being sent to Zalmoxis. Cotyso accepts that he must die and is sacrificed by being thrown onto spears. Decebalus says that the god will now be with them in their battles.

After Severus reports back, an angry Domitian sends Fuscus to crush the Dacians. Severus is ordered by Fuscus to lead the vanguard into an attack on the Dacians in a valley, but they are drawn into an ambush. Severus is badly injured. Believing him dead, Fuscus blames the disaster on Severus. Meanwhile, a wounded and delirious Severus is wandering through the mountains. He is found by Decebalus' daughter Meda, who takes him to her cabin. They fall in love. When Decebalus finds out, he asks Severus to convince Domitian to negotiate, but Severus says that he must do his duty as a Roman officer. Decebalus lets him go. Back at the camp, Severus argues violently with Fuscus. Fuscus says he intends to overthrow Domitian, offering Severus the position of governor of Dacia, but the latter refuses. The two generals fight each other, and Severus kills Fuscus. Witnessing the fight, Domitian gives Severus command of the army and tells him to attack the Dacians. Decebalus, meanwhile has assembled his own army. The two armies confront each other across the battlefield. Decebalus and Severus meet between the armies and engage in single combat. Severus is killed. As he dies he says "this is all I could do for you". The two armies then march towards each other into battle.

==Significance==
The film was one of several nationalist epics produced during [[Nicolai Ceausescu]]'s regime. According to Mark Stolarik it is about the ethnogenesis of the Romanian people as a "Dacian-Roman synthesis". After ''[[Mihai Viteazul (film)|Mihai Viteazul]]'' (''Michael the Brave''), it is the most watched Romanian historical film, and the fourth most watched movie of all time in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mark Stolarik, ''The Prague Spring and the Warsaw Pact Invasion of Czechoslovakia, 1968: Forty Years Later'', Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, 2010, p.252.&lt;/ref&gt; Mira Liehm and Antonín J. Liehm argue that "the pathos of ''The Dacians'' and ''Michael the Brave'' was so moving to the Romanian audience and the films' naivete so sincere that their success became something of a sociological phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;Mira Liehm and Antonín J. Liehm, ''The Most Important Art: Eastern European Film After 1945'', University of California Press, 1977, p.350.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enlighten Canberra''' is an outdoor annual art and cultural festival held in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]] featuring illuminating light installations and projections, performances from local and interstate musicians, dining and film events.

The festival is an [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) Government initiative held annually in early March, encouraging people to "See Canberra in a whole new light." The centrepiece of Enlighten Canberra is the illuminating of Canberra's cultural institutions after dark, including [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Old Parliament House]],  [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] and the [[National Gallery of Australia]] (since the 2011 event) as well as the [[National Portrait Gallery (Australia)|National Portrait Gallery]] and [[Questacon]] (since the 2012 event). There is also live music, film screenings and after-hours tours.

Since its inception, Enlighten has become increasingly popular, attracting 115,000 visitors in 2013 and 131,500 in 2014. Attendance rose again in 2015, to 287,874 visitors.

==History of the event==

In 2008 [[Australian Labor Party (Australian Capital Territory Branch)|ACT Labor]] made an election promise to deliver a new autumn event for [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]—this was the beginnings of Enlighten Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O1lm7iKQR8eD1PuokQfKE88Dc3sP1mGpi4WIxUoq_NQ/edit?pli=1|first=Brendan|last=Smyth|author-link=Brendan Smyth (politician)|title=Enlighten downgraded to a subsidiary event|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.katygallagher.net/?p=2331|first=Katy|last=Gallagher|archivedate=10 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410220416/http://www.katygallagher.net/?p=2331|title=$12 million to support jobs and boost tourism|date=25 September 2012|author-link=Katy Gallagher}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December&amp;nbsp;2010, [[Andrew Barr]], then [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, announced the  ACT Government Enlighten would be a major annual event, commencing in March&amp;nbsp;2011. He said national attractions that would participate with lit facades after dark included the [[National Gallery of Australia]], [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] and [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Old Parliament House]]. Ticketed events were also announced, including headline international acts in concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.andrewbarr.com.au/story/new-event-light-canberra%E2%80%99s-autumn-nights|date=13 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308023250/http://www.andrewbarr.com.au/story/new-event-light-canberra%E2%80%99s-autumn-nights|archivedate=8 March 2011|deadurl=no|title=New event to light up Canberra’s autumn nights|first=Andrew|last=Barr|author-link=Andrew Barr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Frick Fine Arts Building sits on the southern edge of [[Schenley Plaza]], opposite [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|The Carnegie Institute]], and is the home of Pitt's History of Art and Architecture Department, Studio Arts Department, and the Frick Fine Arts Library. Before its front steps is [[Mary Schenley Memorial Fountain]].

==History==
[[File:Frick Fine Arts Building - Pitt - IMG 0762.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Clay Frick]] portrait by [[Malvina Hoffman]] on the facade of the building]]
The Frick Fine Arts Building sits on the site of the former [[Schenley Park Casino]], Pittsburgh's first multi-purpose arena with an indoor ice skating rink, sat on the location of the building before burning down in December 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haa.pitt.edu/resources/documents/SchenleyPark.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627195733/http://www.haa.pitt.edu/resources/documents/SchenleyPark.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building itself is a gift of [[Helen Clay Frick]] (1888–1984), daughter of the Pittsburgh industrialist and art patron [[Henry Clay Frick]] (1849–1919). She established the [[Fine Arts]] Department at the University of Pittsburgh in 1926 and continued to fund it through the 1950s, when she first made a commitment to create a separate structure to house it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://www.haa.pitt.edu/resources/documents/ffab.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627200101/http://www.haa.pitt.edu/resources/documents/ffab.pdf |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Land for the project was donated to the university by the City of Pittsburgh.

In early negotiations with the University of Pittsburgh, Miss Frick asked that successors to the [[New York City|New York]] architects [[Carrère and Hastings]] design the new facility after the Italian [[palazzo]] its firm had built in [[Manhattan]] for her father some fifty years earlier. Eventually, however, both parties agreed to Burton Kenneth Johnstone Associates as the architects. Its design is modeled after [[Pope Julius III]]'s (1487–1555) [[Villa Giulia]] in [[Rome, Italy]]. The building is constructed of white limestone and marble with a terracotta tile roof around a central courtyard. An octagonal cupola, which caps the central rotunda, rises 45 feet above the ground.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The building houses the University of Pittsburgh's Department of History of Art and Architecture, and contains classrooms, an open cloister, an art gallery, a 200-seat auditorium, as well as a research library. Construction began in 1962 and the building was opened in May 1965.

By the late 1960s Miss Frick, unhappy that the university did not conform to her restrictions on management of both the department and the new building, severed her ties with the University of Pittsburgh. She responded by creating a new venture, [[Frick Art &amp; Historical Center|The Frick Art Museum]], on the property of her ancestral home, Clayton, a few miles east in Pittsburgh's [[Point Breeze, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Point Breeze]] neighborhood. That museum operates today as a part of the [[Frick Art &amp; Historical Center]] complex.

==Building use and features==
[[File:Art gallery at the Frick Fine Arts Building 2.jpg|thumb|The Nicholas Lochoff Cloister of Frick Fine Arts Building]]
The Frick Fine Arts Building consists of classrooms, a library, and art galleries around an open cloister and contains a {{convert|45|ft|m}} high octagon capped by a pyramidal roof.&lt;ref name="TokerNewPortrait"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pittsburgh: A New Portrait |first=Franklin |last=Toker |year=2009 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |location=Pittsburgh, PA |page=335 |ISBN=0-8229-4371-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A noted 1965 low relief portrait of Henry Clay Frick by [[Malvina Hoffman]] in limestone sits above the entrance to the building. Hoffman was 79 years old when she accepted the commission. She could not sculpt it herself because union rules prevented sculptors from working on a relief attached to a building. However, she climbed up on the scaffolding to oversee the completion of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicartpittsburgh.org/pdf_files/PAPP_Oakland_Walking_Tour.pdf |title=Office of Public Art - Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council |publisher=Publicartpittsburgh.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vrcoll.fa.pitt.edu/uag/Art-Anytime-Page/Pittsburgh-Sculpture/Hoffman-Frick-Pages/index.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610121238/http://vrcoll.fa.pitt.edu/uag/Art-Anytime-Page/Pittsburgh-Sculpture/Hoffman-Frick-Pages/index.htm |date=June 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the main entrance, a neon work by contemporary Chinese artist [[Gu Wenda]] is installed in the lobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haa.pitt.edu/node/494|title=History of Art and Architecture: Permanent Collection|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building also contains a 200-seat auditorium that is used for lectures, performances, and special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidde.pitt.edu/classrooms/fkart_125.html|title=Media Enhanced Classrooms: Frick Fine Arts 125|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Center or Instructional Development &amp; Distance Education|date=September 30, 2011|accessdate=February 4, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608053358/http://www.cidde.pitt.edu/classrooms/fkart_125.html|archivedate=June 8, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicholas Lochoff Cloister==
[[File:FrickFineArtsLibrary.jpg|thumb|upright|The Frick Fine Arts Library]]
The [[Nicholas Lochoff Cloister]] is a main feature of the Frick Fine Arts Building. Its large paintings of [[Italian art|Italian]] masterpieces are scale reproductions that were commissioned in 1911 from [[Nicholas Lochoff]] by the Moscow Museum of Fine Arts (now the [[Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]]). Lochoff worked slowly and carefully. Only a few paintings were completed and sent back to [[Russia]] by the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. Lochoff, unable to return because of new communist regime, felt compelled to sell off the paintings. Buyers included [[Harvard University]] and the Frick Art Reference Library in New York. Miss Frick acquired the entire collection, however, after Lochoff's death, with the help of art critic [[Bernard Berenson]]. In 2003, the paintings were cleaned and restored by Christine Daulton. Also in the gallery are noted [[Carrara]] marble reproductions of 14th century [[Annunciation]] figures by sculptor [[Alceo Dossena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X9cNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=amwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7276%2C900049 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712004825/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X9cNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=amwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7276,900049 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=Pitt Fakes Given New Importance |first=Donald |last=Miller |date=1968-12-05 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frick Fine Arts Library==
Located in Frick Fine Arts Building, this two-story library houses a circulating research collection serving the Department of the History of Art and Architecture. The Collection contains over 90,000 volumes and subscribes to more than 350 journals in relevant fields and is ranked among the top 10 fine art libraries in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.pitt.edu/libraries/frick/fine_arts.html |title=Frick Fine Arts Library - University Library System - University of Pittsburgh |publisher=Library.pitt.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525110603/http://www.library.pitt.edu/libraries/frick/fine_arts.html |archivedate=2012-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.pitt.edu/tour/tour-060.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819184916/http://www.umc.pitt.edu/tour/tour-060.html |date=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The library's reading room is constructed of fruit wood paneling and cabinetwork with gold leaf trim designed by Italian craftsmen.  The library is further appointed by wrought iron balcony railings, terracotta tile flooring, maple tables with matching Windsor chairs, and ceiling-high windows furnishing views of [[Schenley Park]].  An inscription on the wall facing the entrance indicates the libraries dedication to [[Henry Clay Frick]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==University Arts Gallery==
[[File:Frick Fine Arts Building - Pitt - IMG 0767.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the University Arts [[Art museum|Gallery]] flanked by marble [[Alceo Dossena|Dossena]] statues]]
The permanent [[collection (artwork)|collection]] contains a collection of prints and graphic works dating from the 16th through 20th centuries and regularly hosts changing exhibitions sponsored by the Department of the History of Art and Architecture and the Friends organization.  Some of the more prominent pieces in the permanent collection include a large collection of [[Jacques Callot]] and [[Gertrude Quastler]] prints;  16th-18th century drawings from the Clapp and Denny families; a collection of 19th and 20th century photography; the Gimbel collection of American art; and various Japanese prints, Asian ceramics, portraits, and Pittsburgh-related paintings by Hetzel, Gorson, and Kane.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The '''Gowers Review of Intellectual Property''' was an independent review of UK [[intellectual property]] (IP) focusing on [[copyright law of the United Kingdom|UK copyright law]] that was published in December 2006. The then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] commissioned [[Andrew Gowers]] to lead the review in December 2005. The Review was published on 6 December 2006 as part of the Chancellor's annual pre-budget report. The review concludes that the UK's intellectual property system is fundamentally strong but made 54 recommendations for improvements.

== Recommendations ==

=== Instruments - Balance ===
* 1 - "Amend section 60(5) of the [[Patents Act 1977]] to clarify the research exception to facilitate experimentation, innovation and education"
* 2 - "Enable educational provisions to cover [[distance learning]] and [[interactive whiteboards]] by 2008 by amending sections 35 and 36 of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]"
* 3 - "The [[European Commission]] should retain the length of protection on sound recordings and performers’ rights at 50 years"
* 4 - "Policy makers should adopt the principle that the term and scope of protection for IP rights should not be altered retrospectively"&lt;ref name="official-documents6"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Andrew| first = Gowers| title = Gowers Review of Intellectual Property| publisher = HM Treasury| date = December 2006   | page =6 | url = http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/0118404830/0118404830.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instruments - Coherence ===
* 5 - The Patent Office "should undertake joint working with African patent offices from mid-2007, with the aim of:

== Private copying ==
The review coincided with a 2006 survey carried out on behalf of the National Consumer Council, which indicated that over half of British adults infringe copyright law by duplicating and [[ripping]] music CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Consumer Council |date=2006-05-11 |title=Shake-up 'absurd' copyright laws, says NCC |url=http://www.ncc.org.uk/news_press/pr.php?recordID=271 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003200223/http://www.ncc.org.uk/news_press/pr.php?recordID=271 |archivedate=2007-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the review, in January 2008 the government initiated a public consultation period on proposals to legalise personal copying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7176538.stm|title=Copying CDs could be made legal|date=2008-01-08|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright terms extension ==
On November 27, 2006, it was reported that Gowers would not recommend for the [[copyright term]] of recorded music to be extended from the current 50 years after the date of recording. The [[British Phonographic Industry]] and prominent musicians, such as [[Cliff Richard]] and [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]], had lobbied for an extension to 95 years, matching the length of copyright provided in the United States; other musicians, such as [[Dave Rowntree]] of [[Blur (band)|Blur]] provided counteropinions. The Gowers Review found that the UK, compared with the USA, suffers no apparent impediment to creativity due to this disparity. To coincide with the publication of the review on the 6 December a full-page advertisement entitled [[Fair play for musicians]], was taken in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' of December 7, stating "We call upon the UK Government to support the extension of copyright on sound recordings", and was signed by over 4,500 musicians, including a few dead ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lessig.org/blog/against_term_extension/ Lessig Blog: Ok, so I'm wrong]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repercussions==
Richard Sargeant, a civil servant who wrote large amounts of the Review,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/23/europe_music_copyright_term/ The Register: EU votes for longer music copyright]&lt;/ref&gt; was later hired by [[Google]]. In January 2009, as Google's "public policy manager", he called for reforms to incorporate exemptions similar to the United States' [[fair use]] doctrine into UK and Europe copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jan/22/google-calls-for-uk-copyright-reforms The Guardian: Google calls for UK copyright reforms]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grand Austrian State Prize''' ({{Lang-de|Großer Österreichischer Staatspreis}}) is a decoration given annually by [[Austria]] to an artist for exceptional work. The recipient must be an Austrian citizen with a permanent residence in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kunstkultur.bka.gv.at/site/8108/default.aspx | title=Großer Österreichischer Staatspreis | language=German | page= | publisher=Bundeskanzleramt Österreich | trans-title=Grand Austrian State Prize | format = | accessdate= April 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally created in 1950 by then education minister [[Felix Hurdes]]. The prize is given according to the recommendation by the Austrian Art Senate without a set rotation schedule for [[literature]], [[music]], [[visual art]], or [[architecture]]. Since 2003 it has been endowed with a 30,000 [[euro]] prize. In the areas of [[film]] and [[artistic photography]], the prize is awarded according to a jury and not the Art Senate.

Since 1971, the prize has been given to only one person a year, instead of sometimes given to multiple people in different categories.

'''H. Huntsman &amp; Sons''' (known as Huntsman of Savile Row) is a high-end fashion house and tailor located at No. 11 [[Savile Row]], London.&lt;ref name="Huntsman Website"&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/ Huntsman Website]&lt;/ref&gt; It is known for its English [[bespoke]] menswear tailoring, [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] ready-to-wear collections, and leather accessories.

In 1886, the company earned its first [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] as Leather Breeches Maker to HRH the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII). This was followed by that of HRH Prince Albert, Duke of Saxe Coburg Gotha and [[Queen Victoria]] in 1888. In September 2017, Huntsman served as the inspiration for [[Matthew Vaughn]]'s blockbuster movie [[Kingsman: The Golden Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/the-company/about-huntsman/|title=About Huntsman|work=Huntsman|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1849, Huntsman is a [[Savile Row]] tailor,&lt;ref name="Sherwood 62"&gt;James Sherwood, Savile Row: The Master Tailors of British Bespoke, (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2010), p.62&lt;/ref&gt; producing traditional [[bespoke tailoring]] for gentlemen and ladies. Huntsman has been granted several [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|royal warrants]] bestowed by British and European monarchs, including The Prince of Wales, (later [[Edward VII]]) and [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name="Sherwood 62" /&gt;  Huntsman is also one of the founders of the [[Savile Row Bespoke Association]]&lt;ref name="Kingsman"&gt;[http://www.savilerowbespoke.com/2015/02/kingsman/ Savile Row Bespoke Association on 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'] 2015/02&lt;/ref&gt; - the trade body responsible for protecting and promoting the working practices of Savile Row.

==History==
Founded in 1849 by Mr. Henry Huntsman,&lt;ref name="Huntsman Website"/&gt; H. Huntsman &amp; Sons incorporated a Victorian breeches-maker dating back to 1809 when the house was first established at No. 126 [[New Bond Street]].&lt;ref name="Anderson 106"&gt;Richard Anderson, ''Bespoke: Savile Row Ripped and Smoothed'', ([[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2009) p.106&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Huntsman thereby founded a tailoring house which quickly gained a reputation for dressing the hunting and riding aristocracy of Europe for much of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Sherwood 62" /&gt; Huntsman continues to make equestrian and sporting tailoring today and Henry Huntsman's very own breeches are still displayed in the company's Savile Row shop.&lt;ref name="Henry Huntsman Riding Breeches"&gt;[http://www.h-huntsman.com/blog/ma-dao-cheng-gong-horses-bring-success H. Huntsman's breeches]&lt;/ref&gt; Early twentieth century advertisements for Huntsman breeches survive in the company's archives,&lt;ref name="Sherwood 62" /&gt;  as do photographs depicting many golden-era Hollywood celebrities ([[Clarke Gable]] and [[David Niven]] for example) wearing Huntsman breeches and riding trousers, as well as images of [[Edward VII|His Royal Highness Edward VII]] in full equestrian dress atop horse.&lt;ref name="Sherwood 63"&gt;James Sherwood, Savile Row: The Master Tailors of British Bespoke, (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2010), p.63&lt;/ref&gt; The house's relationship with British royalty extends as far back as Queen Victoria and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], who both patronised the house from its opening in 1849.&lt;ref name="Savile Row Bespoke Association Website 'About Us'"&gt;[http://www.savilerowbespoke.com/about-us/history/19th-century-history 'About Us' Savile Row Bespoke Association] see 19th century history timeline&lt;/ref&gt;

During the First World War, Huntsman's was a tailor to the military, producing [[dress uniforms]] for British officers throughout the conflict. Several ledger books remain in Huntsman's archives today, listing the names of each officer and their commissions, often with a note revealing their fate in the margins.&lt;ref name="Sherwood 62" /&gt; The firm moved to No. 11 Savile Row with the ending of the war in 1919&lt;ref name="Anderson 106" /&gt; with the onset of the [[Roaring 20s]]. The Prince of Wales (soon to become [[Edward VIII]]) was a customer during the 1920s,&lt;ref name="Huntsman Portfolio"&gt;[http://www.h-huntsman.com/heritage/portfolio?p=edward-viii&amp;page=1 'Edward VIII Portfolio', Huntsman]&lt;/ref&gt; which prompted much of the jet-set of the time to follow. [[Cecil Beaton]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Bill Blass]] and [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]] were all notable clients.&lt;ref name="Huntsman Customer Porfolio"&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/world-of-huntsman/#/heritage 'Portfolio', Huntsman]&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that Huntsman came to acquire the two stags' heads which overlook the shop-front today. They fell into the company's hands by chance; being left by a customer who went out to lunch in 1921 and neglected to ever return.&lt;ref name="Wei Koh"&gt;Wei Koh, 'The Supreme Structuralists', ''The Rake'' International Edition, Issue 32, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, Henry Huntsman's sons passed on the firm to Mr. Robert Packer. Packer was the 'human dynamo' according to Richard Anderson,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; who drove the company forward into the twenty-first century, transforming "Huntsman's reputation from that of merely a reliable gaiter and britches maker to a glamorous bespoke fashion house".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; From the 30s to the 70s, working with Head Cutter Colin Hammick, Packer ensured that Huntsman's reputation as the most expensive Savile Row tailor was well established. Hammick believed he offered 'the best quality' on Savile Row to justify the house's high prices,&lt;ref name="Edith M Lederer"&gt;Edith M Lederer, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19841025&amp;id=EgFOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-YsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3050,3969929&amp;hl=en London's Famed Tailors Go International]  ''[[The Free Lance Star]]'', October 25, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; retaining a high-profile international client list.&lt;ref name="Edith M Lederer" /&gt; Perhaps most notable was the house's relationship with [[Gregory Peck]], who Huntsman dressed for half a century between 1953 and 2003.&lt;ref name="Huntsman Website Gregory Peck Portfolio"&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/gregory-peck-2/ 'Gregory Peck Portfolio', Huntsman]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Peck (and his film studios) commissioned over 160 suits from the house both for use on screen and off.&lt;ref name="Huntsman Presents Gregory Peck Style Archive"&gt;[http://wjlondon.com/lcm-huntsman-presents-gregory-peck-style-archive/ ''WJLondon'' Article], Camilla Hunt, 'LCM: Huntsman Presents Gregory Peck Style Archive', ''WJLondon'', June 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising material from the 50s and 60s shows that Hammick created traditional Savile Row tailoring with a fashionable edge.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, pp.68-9&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Hammick himself was named the 'Best Dressed Man of the Year' by the Tailor &amp; Cutter magazine in 1971, testifying to his sense of style.&lt;ref name="The Times obituary"&gt;[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/colin-hammick-the-times-obituary-6qtvc8q3d2x Times obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Hammick not only oversaw operations when Huntsman was at its largest in terms of size - during the early 80s the house employed some 130 people and in 1980 reported sales of $2.4 million&lt;ref name="Lakeland Ledger Article"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19810329&amp;id=vdIvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Q_sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5566,4845725&amp;hl=en 'Custom Suits Are Like Good Food'], Susan Heller Anderson, ''Lakeland Ledger'', March 29, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; - but was also responsible for mentoring many of Savile Row's current heavyweights.

In 2013, financier [[Pierre Lagrange]] purchased Huntsman,&lt;ref name="Jon Holt"&gt;Jon Holt, [http://www.thebespokegent.com/2013/06/an-interview-with-huntsman-owner-roubi.html Interview with Pierre Lagrange], ''The Bespoke Gent'',  '',  June 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and the house has since undergone a number of modernisations. Campbell Carey was appointed Creative Director in 2015&lt;ref name="New Developments at Huntsman"&gt;[http://www.h-huntsman.com/blog/new-developments-at-huntsman New Developments at Huntsman] ''Huntsman Journal'', May 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  and has helped to reintroduce a Huntsman [[ready-to-wear]] collection. Lagrange has also introduced [[E-commerce]] to the company's website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/ready-to-wear/ Shop], Huntsman&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, Senior Cutter Dario Carnera, was promoted Co-Head Cutter with Mr Carey, a first in the history of Savile Row.&lt;ref name="New Developments at Huntsman" /&gt; Likewise in 2013, Huntsman acted as the inspiration behind ‘[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]’ a Hollywood spy-thriller starring [[Colin Firth]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Reportedly, Director [[Matthew Vaughn]] first decided to set his film within a tailor’s shop when visiting Huntsman for a fitting.&lt;ref name="Kingsman at Huntsman: A Fitting Tribute"&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/kingsman-at-huntsman-a-fitting-tribute/ 'Kingsman at Huntsman, a Fitting Tribute'] Huntsman Journal, January 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughn has been a Huntsman customer since his mother brought him to the store to order his first bespoke suit at eighteen years of age,&lt;ref name="Kingsman Goes Undercover"&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/kingsman-huntsman-goes-under-cover/ Kingsman Goes Undercover] ''Huntsman Journal'', January 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; making Huntsman a natural choice of setting. Both the shop front and interior appear in the movie.&lt;ref name="Kingsman Goes Undercover" /&gt;

==Bespoke process==

Although Huntsman's suits retain what Wei Koh, Editor-in-Chief of ''The Rake'' magazine refers to as 'their famous structured silhouette',&lt;ref&gt;Koh, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; Huntsman's website notes that 'our team can work to almost any brief'.&lt;ref name="Huntsman Bespoke Tailoring"&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/bespoke/ 'Bespoke Suits', Huntsman]&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, the house created a bespoke quilted-leather double-breasted car-coat in collaboration with [[Bentley]].&lt;ref name="Savile Row's Driving Jackets for Bentley"&gt;[http://www.permanentstyle.co.uk/2015/05/savile-rows-driving-jackets.html ''Permanent Style'' Article] Simon Crompton, 'Savile Row's Driving Jackets for Bentley', ''Permanent Style'', May 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

As outlined on the Huntsman website, the process of placing an order begins with a consultation, during which the customer meets with Johnny Allen, Bespoke Clients Manager, who discusses the customer's requirements for his suit, helping to finalise any stylistic decisions and his choice of fabric.&lt;ref name="Bespoke Heritage"&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/world-of-huntsman/#/heritage Bespoke Heritage], Huntsman&lt;/ref&gt; A cutter will then measure-up the client (Huntsman takes an average of 30 different measures for a first suit),&lt;ref name="Bespoke Heritage" /&gt; before this is drafted into the traditional brown paper pattern. This pattern is then chalked onto the customer's chosen cloth, which is in turn cut out. This will then be sewn together into the suit's raw three-dimensional form by a dedicated coat maker, ready for fitting. Huntsman produces all of its clothes in house, so every suit is produced by the same team.&lt;ref name="Bespoke Heritage" /&gt;

After the first fitting, the basted garment is then returned to its two-dimensional form and re-cut according to the refined pattern, after which a second fitting will take place to re-assess the garment's fit. More structure will be added to the garment at this stage, jacket sleeves will be set-in by hand and the suit's lining felled into the garment accordingly. Other hand-sewn elements will include all buttonholes, the trouser fly and any topstitching applied to the jacket and/or waistcoat lapels and pocket flaps - conforming to Savile Row Bespoke Association working standards.&lt;ref name="Savile Row Bespoke, About Us, Bespoke Process"&gt;[http://www.savilerowbespoke.com/about-us/bespoke-process/ 'Bespoke Process' Savile Row Bespoke Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Further alterations are carried out if required and a final fitting will take place. Each individual suit takes over eighty man-hours to produce.&lt;ref name="Bespoke Heritage" /&gt;

==House style==

A Huntsman suit is characterised predominantly by its structured shoulders and high armholes.&lt;ref name="Parisian Gentleman"&gt;Hugo Jacomet, [http://parisiangentleman.co.uk/2012/02/13/huntsman-sons-not-trifling-with-tradition/ Huntsman &amp; Sons, Not Trifling With Tradition]  ''The Parisian Gentleman'', February 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The line through the waist is cut long with a subtle hourglass shape and some flair in the skirt which reflects Huntsman's sporting heritage.&lt;ref name="Bespoke Heritage" /&gt; Jackets are generally cut with Huntsman's signature one button fastening and menswear historian James Sherwood notes that 'the one-button [coat] is notoriously difficult to balance - the cutter's answer to a perfect pirouette en pointe - hence Huntsman's pride in it'.&lt;ref name="Sherwood 62" /&gt;

==House cloths==

Huntsman has a long history of commissioning exclusive cloths for its customers,&lt;ref name="Huntsman Tweed Suit Part I"&gt;[http://www.permanentstyle.co.uk/2010/08/huntsman-tweed-suit-part-1.html ''Permanent Style'' Article] Simon Crompton, 'Huntsman Tweed Suit Part I', ''Permanent Style'', August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  particularly bold checked [[tweeds]]. These are produced on an annual basis at the family-run 'Islay Woollen Mill', the oldest [[woollen mill]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]].&lt;ref name="About Us, Islay Woollen Mill"&gt;[http://www.islaywoollenmill.co.uk/about-us/ 'About Us', Islay Woollen Mill]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the house produced a collection of exclusive tweeds inspired by those worn by Huntsman's famous patron Gregory Peck. A clothes worn by Peck and cut by Huntsman's famous former Head Cutter Colin Hammick in the 1960s survive in the Peck family to this day.&lt;ref name="Huntsman, Heritage Cloths"&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/bespoke/cloth-selection/ 'Huntsman Tweeds 2014, Inspired by a 1961 Original']&lt;/ref&gt; Upon rediscovering one particularly bold checked tweed sports coat, cut in an exclusive house tweed from 1961,&lt;ref name="Huntsman, Heritage Cloths" /&gt; Huntsman redeveloped the tweed, enlarging the original design and lending it a softer, more contemporary finish.&lt;ref name="Huntsman Tweeds Inspired by Gregory Peck"&gt;[http://www.h-huntsman.com/blog/huntsman-2014-house-tweeds-inspired-by-gregory-peck 'Huntsman 2014 House Tweeds Inspired by Gregory Peck'] Huntsman Journal, September 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the house produced its first cashmere tweed in over fifty years, a replica of a houndstooth cloth that was originally an exclusive Huntsman fabric woven in 1952 and favoured by Peck for the majority of his life.&lt;ref name="Huntsman Tweeds Inspired by Gregory Peck" /&gt;

The House also has a reputation for the production of limited edition suitings, working closely with [[wool]] producers and weavers on exclusive projects. In 2007, the house purchased the world's only bale of 11.9 micron, 1PP graded wool at a wool auction in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="Huntsman Opus Fabric"&gt;[http://www.h-huntsman.com/blog/opus-huntsmans-most-precious-cloth-to-date 'Opus, Huntsman's most precious cloth to date'], Huntsman Journal, February 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of such a low micron count together with the AWEX 1PP award for wool-quality effectively graded the wool as the finest ever produced.&lt;ref name="Huntsman Opus Fabric" /&gt; This was woven into Huntsman's record breaking 'Opus' cloth, woven to one of the finest yarn counts possible, a 'Super 240s'.&lt;ref name="Huntsman Opus Fabric" /&gt; 34 suit lengths of the cloth were produced, woven into a navy [[twill]] and [[herringbone (cloth)|herringbone]]. Today, only a few metres of the navy herringbone remain, with the navy twill entirely sold out.&lt;ref name="Huntsman Opus Fabric" /&gt;

==Clients==
Huntsman  clients have included [[King Edward VII]], [[King Edward VIII]], [[King Alfonso XII]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Rudolph Valentino]], [[Lord Mountbatten]],  [[Gregory Peck]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/gregory-peck-2/ Gregory Peck]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clark Gable]], [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Marc Jacobs]], [[Lapo Elkann]], and [[Gianni Agnelli]].&lt;ref&gt;H.Huntsman &amp; Sons, [https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/category/hall-of-fame/ Our Clients]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff==

Carol Pierce joined Huntsman in 2014 as the house's General Manager,&lt;ref name="New Developments at Huntsman" /&gt;  primarily to ensure consistency in the quality of Huntsman's bespoke product, as well as to develop the availability of Huntsman's bespoke service in foreign markets.&lt;ref name="New Developments at Huntsman" /&gt;  Pierce works closely with Creative Director Campbell Carey, who joined Huntsman in early 2015,&lt;ref name="New Developments at Huntsman" /&gt; and is responsible for overseeing the design of all the house's ready-to-wear collections, ensuring that 'the bespoke values of the company are present within the full range of products, from ready-to-wear tailoring to accessories.'&lt;ref name="New Developments at Huntsman" /&gt;  Campbell combines a mix of bespoke cutting expertise with experience in [[ready-to-wear]], a skill-set honed previously at similar British bespoke tailor, Kilgour on Savile Row.&lt;ref name="GQ"&gt;[http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2015-04/01/huntsman-savile-row-hires-campbell-carey-robert-bailey 'Meet the Tailors Who'll Soon Be Shaking Up Huntsman'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712231527/http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2015-04/01/huntsman-savile-row-hires-campbell-carey-robert-bailey |date=2015-07-12 }} Liz Connor, ''GQ'', April 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing the role of Co-Head Cutter with Carey is Dario Carnera, whose background is similarly bespoke-orientated, with his father running the London cordwainer [[Cleverley|G.J. Cleverley]].&lt;ref name="Who We Are, G.J. Cleverley"&gt;[http://www.gjcleverley.co.uk/who-we-are 'Who We Are', G.J. Cleverly]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Bespoke Clients Manager Johnny Allen is but one of several 'Allens' in the trade. His brother runs the '[[Charlie Allen (designer)|Charlie Allen]]' bespoke tailor in the City.&lt;ref name="Charlie Allen"&gt;[http://www.charlieallen.co.uk/ Charlie Allen Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Allen has worked in bespoke tailoring for the past twenty five years, and is acknowledged within the bespoke community as an authority on classic men's style.

In March 2015, Dionne Reeves and Vanessa Black, two of Huntsman’s apprentices qualified as Finalists for [[Golden Shears|The Golden Shears]],&lt;ref name="Golden Shears"&gt;[http://www.merchant-taylors.co.uk/our-activities/golden-shears/ 'Our Activities: The Golden Shears', Merchant Taylors's Company]&lt;/ref&gt; (Savile Row’s biannual bespoke tailoring competition for young tailors, commonly referred to as the Oscars of the tailoring world).&lt;ref name="Savile Row Bespoke on the Golden Shears"&gt;[http://www.savilerowbespoke.com/2015/03/golden-shears-2/ 'The Golden Shears', Savile Row Bespoke Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Reeves went on to receive the prestigious Silver Shears award.&lt;ref name="Golden Shears"/&gt;

==Modern developments==

2016 - 2017

In February 2016, Huntsman became the first Savile Row tailor to open a permanent location in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-07-13/huntsman-brings-its-savile-row-style-to-a-stateside-audience Huntsman Brings, "Its Savile Row Style to a Stateside Audience"]&lt;/ref&gt; American clientele now enjoy a permanent home in the States in a pied-à-terre in New York with antique Huntsman tweed covered furnishings and historic photographs from Huntsman’s past adorning the walls.

Alongside regular visits to the east coast of America, visiting clients based in New York City, Boston and Washington (as well as Chicago), the house also undertakes regular west coast tours, visiting San Francisco and Los Angeles.  Huntsman expanded its trunk shows, pioneering visits to different corners of Asia, including a trunk show in Seoul and visits to Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing.[45]

With daytime fashion in mind, 2016 featured a busy social calendar for Huntsman. The house participated in the polo&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poloplus10.com/gold-cup-equus-huntsman-triumph-sotogrande-38118/, "Land Rover International Polo Tournament 2014"]&lt;/ref&gt; and racing seasons with the highlights being Huntsman’s Royal Ascot residence on the Rosebery, as well as the house’s post-racing party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tatler.com/bystander/events/2016/june/the-rosebery-and-huntsmans-royal-ascot-party#!/21841/image/1, "The Rosebery and Huntsman’s Royal Ascot party"]&lt;/ref&gt; 
2016 also saw Huntsman taking on more modern projects including cutting bespoke tweed driving suits for Marc Newson and Charlotte Stockdale&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.countryandtownhouse.co.uk/brands-guide/huntsman/, "Country &amp; Town House Magazine"]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2016 Mille Miglia Race.

Huntsman’s Savile Row premises play host to a variety of exciting events, including charity auctions for several worthy causes, which have raised up to £80,000 in donations. Exhibitions for artists such as Cecil Beaton,&lt;ref&gt;[https://benjaminwild.co/2016/03/23/a-life-in-fashion-the-wardrobe-of-cecil-beaton/ ORhttp://costumesociety.org.uk/blog/post/the-sixties-suits-and-cecil-beaton, "Cecil Beaton"]&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Talbot Rice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alextalbotrice.com/single-post/2016/09/27/Dreams-become-Reality-Exhibition, "Alex Talbot"]&lt;/ref&gt; and Gray Malin were hosted by the house, as well as whisky tastings, private lunches, and book launches

In 2016, over half a million people tuned in live to learn all things bespoke from Huntsman owner Pierre Lagrange and senior cutter Robert Bailey at an event in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ent.le.com/izt/huntsman/index.html, "Beijing"]&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Huntsman even graced the London Fashion Week&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonfashionweekmens.com/news_detail.aspx?ID=655, "London Fashion Week"]&lt;/ref&gt; catwalk as a part of the inspired Gareth Pugh show. The ‘Treasures from Chatsworth’,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wn.com/treasures_from_chatsworth,_presented_by_huntsman_ep._2_commissioning_artworks_across_generations,  "Chatsworth"]&lt;/ref&gt; a miniseries presented by Huntsman and produced by Sotheby’s, was launched in 2016 too - detailing the magnificent collections of the Cavendish family whilst also putting a spotlight on how contemporary Huntsman’s age-old bespoke craftsmanship is.

2013 - 2015

Since taking over the company in 2013, Owner and Non-Executive Chairman [[Pierre Lagrange]] has introduced a number of developments which differentiate Huntsman from the majority of Savile Row tailors. Under Lagrange's direction, Huntsman launched its 'Archive Collection' in 2013,&lt;ref name="Archive Collection"&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/archive/ 'Archive Collection', Huntsman]&lt;/ref&gt; a capsule collection of ready-to-wear [[tailoring]], [[shirting]] and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], returning a ready-to-wear product to Huntsman. The collection focused on both rejuvenating some aspects of Huntsman's traditional block, but also sought to integrate true menswear classics into the collection, as inspired by Huntsman's extensive historical archives.&lt;ref name="Archive Collection" /&gt; E-commerce was introduced at the same time, allowing for the ready-to-wear collection to be purchased online.  Huntsman's website states that newly appointed Creative Director Campbell Carey is responsible for overseeing the ready-to-wear collection.&lt;ref name="New Developments at Huntsman" /&gt; The house's new General Manager Carol Pierce (formally the head of Dunhill's bespoke division) was also appointed in 2015 to oversee the house's bespoke operations.&lt;ref name="New Developments at Huntsman" /&gt;

Alongside regular visits to the east coast of America, visiting clients based in [[New York City]], [[Boston]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] (as well as [[Chicago]]), the house also undertakes regular west coast tours, visiting [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="Huntsman Tours"&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/trunk-shows/#/upcoming-trunk-shows 'Visits', Huntsman]&lt;/ref&gt; Huntsman is also the first Savile Row tailor to open a permanent location in New York, a move that was announced in May 2015.&lt;ref name="New Developments at Huntsman" /&gt; An Asia tour has also been scheduled for September 2015, including a trunk show in [[Seoul]] and visits to [[Tokyo]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="Huntsman Tours Asia"&gt;[https://www.huntsmansavilerow.com/trunk-shows/#/upcoming-trunk-shows 'Asia Trunk Show', Huntsman]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Huntsman is the sponsor of selected initiatives in the world of [[Polo|professional Polo]].&lt;ref name="Huntsman Polo"&gt;[http://www.h-huntsman.com/sentebale-polo/ 'Polo', Huntsman]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, the Huntsman Polo Team was formed and won bronze, silver and gold cups in the Land Rover International Polo Tournament. In November 2014, the house partnered again with another team led by His Royal Highness [[Prince Harry]], dressing his 'Huntsman Sentebale Polo Team' for the Sentebale Polo Cup in [[Abu Dhabi]].&lt;ref name="Senteballe Polo"&gt;[http://www.h-huntsman.com/sentebale-polo/ 'Senteballe Polo', Huntsman]&lt;/ref&gt; A limited number of exclusive polo shirts were available to purchase after the tournament, with a percentage of the proceeds going to [[Sentebale]].&lt;ref name="Huntsman Polo" /&gt; Huntsman also designed a unique lining for the contest, featuring a motif of forget-me-nots, a mark of respect to those children which the Prince's Sentebale charity (the motif of which is also the forget-me-not) works to protect from poverty and disease.&lt;ref name="Senteballe Charity Website"&gt;[http://sentebale.org/ Senteballe Charity Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huntsman was one of five founding members of the [[Savile Row Bespoke Association]] - Savile Row's protective trade body.&lt;ref name="Our Aims Savile Row Bespoke Assocation"&gt;[http://www.savilerowbespoke.com/ 'Objectives', Savile Row Bespoke Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was canceled after two seasons on August 23, 2013.&lt;ref name="cancelled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/08/tv-lands-happily-divorced-cancelled/|title=TV Land's 'Happily Divorced' Cancelled|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and production ==
[[File:Happily Divorced s1 starts shooting.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Happily Divorced'' cast during the first season.]]

''Happily Divorced'' is inspired by the real lives of series creators Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson, who had been high school sweethearts and then married in 1978. They divorced in 1999. Jacobson later [[Coming out|came out]] as gay to Drescher and the two remained friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/15/fran-dreschers-happily-divorced_n_835851.html |title=Fran Drescher's 'Happily Divorced' Close To TV Land Pickup|last=Zakarin|first=Jordan|date=March 15, 2011|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the pair, who had previously created Drescher's earlier series ''[[The Nanny]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/2010/6/4/fran_drescher_outs_ex_hubby_says.htm Fran Drescher Outs Ex Hubby, Says They're Still Great Friends] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608132145/http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/2010/6/4/fran_drescher_outs_ex_hubby_says.htm |date=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began developing the series based on their life experiences. Initially Drescher planned only to write and produce ''Happily Divorced'' but eventually decided to star as well.  Set in Los Angeles, Fran's gay ex-husband still lives with her for economic reasons, with "a very traditional family. Everyone's very accepting that he's gay. They're both dating; he's new at it, she's new at it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guyspy.com/modern-family-peter-marc-jacobson-success-sexuality-and-being-love-fran-drescher|title=Modern Family: Peter Marc Jacobson on Success, Sexuality, and Being in Love with Fran Drescher – GuySpy|work=guyspy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TV Land gave the [[Green-light|green light]] to a [[television pilot|pilot]] episode in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2010/11/30/TV-Land-greenlights-two-scripted-pilots/UPI-90221291140897/ |title=TV Land greenlights two scripted pilots |publisher=UPI.com |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network announced on March 21, 2011, that the series had been picked up with a ten-episode order.&lt;ref name = bc /&gt; The show is shot in front of a live studio audience at CBS Radford in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://on-camera-audiences.com/shows/Happily_Divorced |title=Happily Divorced |publisher=On-camera-audiences.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118031913?refcatid=4025&amp;printerfriendly=true |title=Producers double down for TV Land – Entertainment News, Headline Newsletter Top Stories, Media |publisher=Variety |date=February 10, 2011 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides ''Happily Divorced'' the typical style of the 1990s' sitcoms. There are still more parallels to ''The Nanny'': the opener is an animation, underlaid with specially composed music and also, Drescher refuses a role name and is just called 'Fran'.&lt;ref name="blogs.tvland.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.tvland.com/prime/happily-divorced-starring-fran-drescher-starts-production/ |title="Happily Divorced" Starring Fran Drescher Starts Production « TV Land Prime |publisher=Blogs.tvland.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318101836/http://blogs.tvland.com/prime/happily-divorced-starring-fran-drescher-starts-production/ |archivedate=March 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Nanny'' regulars, Renée Taylor and Charles Shaughnessy, have made guest appearances; the latter having also co-starred on ''Living With Fran''. The show premiered on Wednesday, June 15, 2011, in the 10:30 time slot after the television show ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]''.&lt;ref name="blogs.tvland.com" /&gt;

The show was renewed on July 20, 2011, for a second season of 12 episodes, which started airing weekly on March 7, 2012. The new season is advertised by the slogan "The Laugh is Back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvland.com/video-clips/happily-divorced/hot-in-cleveland-and-happily-divorced-are-back/ |title=Hot in Cleveland and Happily Divorced Are Back |publisher=TVland.com |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224005056/http://www.tvland.com/video-clips/happily-divorced/hot-in-cleveland-and-happily-divorced-are-back |archivedate=February 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning of February 2012 TV Land made the guest stars for season 2 public. There are again some famous ''The Nanny'' faces : [[Renée Taylor]] (alias ''Sylvia Fine'') returns from season 1 as Dori's neighbor "Marilyn", and [[Ann Morgan Guilbert|Ann Guilbert]] (alias ''Yetta'') appears as Marilyn's mother, "Mrs. Kapelmaster". Furthermore, Hollywood beauties [[Morgan Fairchild]] and [[Joan Collins]] will be on view as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/morgan-fairchild-guest-star-on-fran-drescher-happily-divorced-1027928.php |title=Morgan Fairchild to guest star on Fran Drescher's 'Happily Divorced' |publisher=Reality TV World |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2012, the day of the [[TV Land Awards]] 2012, the cable broadcaster extended the second season, picking up an additional 12 episodes, bringing the total count of season 2 to 24 episodes. The initial 12 episode order concluded June 6. The 12 additional episodes began airing November 28, 2012, at 10:30 PM EST, following the Season 4 premiere of ''Hot in Cleveland'' at 10 PM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/483905-TV_Land_Extends_Happily_Divorced_s_Second_Season.php/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731114013/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/483905-TV_Land_Extends_Happily_Divorced_s_Second_Season.php/|date=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was officially cancelled on August 23, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fran-drescher-comedy-happily-divorced-613711/ |title=Fran Drescher Comedy 'Happily Divorced' Canceled at TV Land |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=2013-08-23 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==

Early reviews of the series were mixed. David Hinckley, writing for ''[[The New York Daily News]],'' noted that it "may be that all this will develop an interesting story. On opening night, though, it feels like the show's primary goal is to set up one-liners – which is not how the great shows got to be great."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Hinckley|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2011/06/14/2011-06-14_happily_divorced_review_fran_dreschers_new_tv_land_series_uses_oneliners_gayfrie.html?r=entertainment|title=Fran Drescher's New TV Land Series Uses One-liners, Gay-friendly Jokes|work=[[The New York Daily News]]|date=June 14, 2011|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "so painfully broad and filled with gay stereotypes all but Drescher's most faithful fans will yearn to be separated from their TVs,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Lowry|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117945451|title=TV Review &gt; Happily Divorced|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' summed it as "the kind of throwback you just might want to throw back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew|last=Gilbert|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-15/ae/29661694_1_peter-marc-jacobson-tv-land-comic-relief|title=Drescher's New Sitcom Sounds Familiar In Several Ways|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[Boston Globe]]|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark A. Perigard's review for ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' was very emphatic; he noted that "in ''Happily Divorced'', TV Land, the cable channel for baby boomers, finally may have found the perfect companion to its smash ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark A.|last=Perigard|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/reviews/view/2011_0615happily_never_after_fran_drescher_borrows_from_life_for_divorced_comedy/|title=Fran Drescher Borrows From Life For ''Divorced'' Comedy|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hit Song Science''' is a term coined by [[Mike McCready (music entrepreneur)|Mike McCready]] and trademarked by the company he co-founded, [[Polyphonic HMI]]. It concerns the possibility of predicting whether a song will be a hit, prior to its distribution using automated means such as [[machine learning]] software.

==Scientific background==
The scientific nature of Hit Song Science is a subject of debate in the [[music information retrieval]] (MIR) community. Early studies claimed that using [[machine learning]] techniques could capture some information from audio signals and lyrics that would explain&lt;ref&gt;Dhanaraj, R. and Logan, B. Automatic Prediction of Hit Songs, Proc. of Ismir 2005, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; popularity. 
However, a larger-scale evaluation&lt;ref&gt;Pachet, F. and Roy, P. (2008) [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2008/pachet-08c.pdf Hit Song Science is Not Yet a Science]. Proceedings of Ismir 2008, pages 355-360, Philadelphia, USA&lt;/ref&gt; contradicts the claims of “Hit Song Science”, i.e. that the popularity of a music title can be learned effectively from known audio features. 
Many other reasons, including the well known "cumulative advantage" or [[preferential attachment]] effects deeply contradicts&lt;ref&gt;Pachet, F. (2011) Hit Song Science. [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2011/pachet-11a.pdf] In Tao, Tzanetakis &amp; Ogihara, editor,  Music Data Mining, CRC Press/Chapman Hall&lt;/ref&gt; the possibility of practical applications. 
Nevertheless, automatic prediction techniques are the basis of hit counseling businesses (HSS Technology). Recent work by Herremans et al. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herremans, D., Martens, D., &amp; Sörensen, K.|title=Dance hit song prediction|journal=Journal of New Music Research|date=2014|volume=43|issue=3|pages=291-302|doi=10.1080/09298215.2014.881888|url=http://dorienherremans.com/sites/default/files/wp_hit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that audio features can indeed be used to outperform a random oracle when predicting top 10 versus top 30-40 hits &lt;ref&gt;[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bmvxvm/a-machine-successfully-predicted-the-hit-dance-songs-of-2015 Vice Magazine: A Machine Successfully Predicted the Hit Dance Songs of 2015] &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Commercial applications==
A technology proposing to exploit Hit Song Science was introduced in 2003 by an artificial intelligence company out of Barcelona, Spain, called [[Polyphonic HMI]]. Polyphonic HMI has since spun off a new Delaware C corporation, Music Intelligence Solutions, Inc., which used to run uPlaya, a site geared toward music professionals. In 2006 however one of the company's founders, [[Mike McCready (music entrepreneur)|Mike McCready]] left to pursue another direction in the digital music space.
The idea of Hit Song Science has generated response from many in the music industry, including [[Chuck D]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=51928 XXLmag.com: Chuck D and uPlaya Analyze Hit Songs]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Lamm]], [[Stratton Leopold]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/modules/news/tools.php?tool=print&amp;id=1189500 Stratton Leopold to Advisory Board]&lt;/ref&gt; Gregg Scholl of [[The Orchard (music label)|The Orchard]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2009/06/uplaya-cuts-multitiered-alliance-with-the-orchard.html Music Intelligence Solutions Partners with The Orchard]&lt;/ref&gt; and officials at The Sync Agency&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS55195+16-Jun-2008+MW20080616 Music Intelligence Solutions Partners with The Sync Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Blue Infinity Music. Prior to McCready's departure, Hit Song Science was profiled by [[NBC]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6jg70weJWs NBC Network News Feature on uPlaya]&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFuA0MqP8kA BBC News Report]&lt;/ref&gt; and various major news outlets. The plot line of an episode of "[[Numb3rs]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJL88mBif6U Episode of "Numb3rs" Inspired by Hit Song Science]&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by the technology.
Music Intelligence Solutions, Inc., is using Hit Song Science as a basis for several contests done in partnership with organizations such as [[AllHipHop.com]], [[Urban Latino]] and ''American Songwriter'' magazine, and claims to have predicted the commercial success of [[Norah Jones]]'s debut album, ''[[Come Away with Me]]'', (which won a Grammy for Best Album) and Ben Novak's debut single, "[[Turn Your Car Around]]", which reached the number 12 spot in the UK Top 40 charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uplaya.com/about_hss/hssquotes Ben Novak's debut single enters the UK Top 40 chart at number 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar technologies are now emerging with companies such as [[Mixcloud]], [http://www.musicxray.com MusicXray], and [http://bandmetrics.com/ BandMetrics] who are using their technologies. Mixcloud is working with Queen Mary Technologies.

      <comment>added: the term "passive solar building design" to the initial example with a reference</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4933">'''Integrated design''' is an approach to [[design]] which brings together specialisms usually considered separately.  For example:
*Design of a building which considers [[architecture]], [[structural engineering]], [[passive solar building design]] &lt;ref name="Shahabian"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Aryan |last=Shahabian |title=Integration of Solar-Climatic Vision and Structural Design in Architecture of Tall Buildings |format=PDF |conference=International Conference CISBAT 2015 Future Buildings and Districts - Sustainability from Nano to Urban Scale| pages=179–184 |date=9-11 September 2015 |location=Lausanne |publisher=Lausanne, LESO-PB, EPFL | url=https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/213316/files/2_SHAHABIAN.pdf |access-date=8 July 2018 |archive-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281906226_Integration_of_solar-climatic_vision_and_structural_design_in_architecture_of_tall_buildings |archive-date=September 2015 |doi=10.5075/epfl-cisbat2015-179-184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[HVAC]].  The approach may also integrate [[building lifecycle management]] and a greater consideration of the end users of the building.  The aim of integrated building design is often to produce [[sustainable architecture]].&lt;ref name="Moe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moe |first=Kiel |date=2008 |title=Integrated Design in Contemporary Architecture |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RzuEiv4Rvu4C |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |isbn=1568987455}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Design of both a product (or family of products) and the assembly system that will produce it.&lt;ref name="DeLitDelchambre"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Lit |first1=Pierre |last2=Delchambre |first2=Alain |date=2011 |title=Integrated Design of a Product Family and Its Assembly System |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rZzzBwAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=1461504171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chedmail"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Chedmail |editor-first=Patrick |date=2013 |title=Integrated Design and Manufacturing in Mechanical Engineering: Proceedings of the Third IDMME Conference Held in Montreal, Canada, May 2000 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=833oCAAAQBAJ |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9401599661|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Design of an electronic product that considers both hardware and software aspects, although this is often called co-design (not to be confused with [[participatory design]], which is also often called co-design).

The requirement for integrated design comes when the different specialisms are dependent on each other or "coupled". An alternative or complimentary approach to integrated design is to consciously reduce the dependencies. In  computing and systems design, this approach is known as [[loose coupling]].

==Dis-integrated design==
Three phenomena are associated with a lack of integrated design:&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite conference | url = http://shura.shu.ac.uk/544/1/fulltext.pdf | title = Design Dis-integration Silent, Partial, and Disparate Design | last1 = Stevens | first1 = John, | last2 = Moultrie | first2 = James | last3 = Crilly | first3 = Nathan | date = 2009 | publisher =  Sheffield Hallam University | book-title = In: Undisciplined! Design Research Society Conference 2008 | id = http://shura.shu.ac.uk/544}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Silent design: design by default, by omission or by people not aware that they are participating in design activity.
*Partial design: design is only used to a limited degree, such as in superficial styling, often after the important design decisions have been made.
*Disparate design: design activity may be widespread, but is not co-ordinated or brought together to realise its potential.

A committee is sometimes a deliberate attempt to address disparate design, but [[design by committee]] is associated with silent design.

==Methods for integrated design==

The integrated design approach incorporates methods and tools to encourage and enable the specialists in the different areas to work together to produce an integrated design.&lt;ref name="TichkiewitchBrissaud"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1= Tichkiewitch |editor-first1=Serge |editor-last2= Brissaud |editor-first2=Daniel |date=2013 |title=Methods and Tools for Co-operative and Integrated Design| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=di34CAAAQBAJ |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9401722560}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such method is a [[charrette]] with all specialists present, early in the design process.&lt;ref name="ToddLindsey"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Todd |first1=Joel Ann |last2=Lindsey |first2=Gail |date=2013 |title=Planning and Conducting Integrated Design (ID) Charrettes |url=https://www.wbdg.org/resources/charrettes.php |work=Whole Building Design Guide |publisher=[[National Institute of Building Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Renaissance}}
{{History of Italy}}

The '''Italian Renaissance''' ({{lang-it|Rinascimento}} {{IPA-it|rinaʃʃiˈmento|}}) was a period of [[European history]] that began in [[Italy]] in the 14th century ([[Trecento]]) and lasted until the 17th century ([[Seicento]]), marking the transition from the [[Middle Ages]] to [[Modernity]]. The French word ''renaissance'' (''Rinascimento'' in Italian) means "Rebirth" and defines the period as one of cultural revival and renewed interest in [[classical antiquity]] after the centuries labeled the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] by [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]]. The Renaissance author [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term "Rebirth" in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' but the concept became widespread only in the 19th century, after the works of scholars such as [[Jules Michelet]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt]].

The European Renaissance began in [[Tuscany]] ([[Central Italy]]), and was centred in the city of [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P., ''The European Renaissance: Centre and Peripheries'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Florence, one of the several [[city-states]] of the peninsula, rose to economic prominence by providing credit for European monarchs and laying down the groundwork for [[capitalism]] and [[banking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sée|first=Henri|title=Modern Capitalism Its Origin and Evolution|url=http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|work=University of Rennes|publisher=Batoche Books|accessdate=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007010542/http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Renaissance later spread to [[Venice]], heart of a [[Venetian Empire|mediterranean empire]] and in control of the trade routes with the east since the participation in the [[crusades]] and the voyages of [[Marco Polo]], where the remains of [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek culture]] were brought together and provided [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars with new texts. Finally the Renaissance had a significant effect on the [[Papal States]] and [[Rome]], largely rebuilt by Humanist and [[Renaissance pope]]s (such as [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]), who were frequently involved in [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Italian politics]], in [[Treaty of Tordesillas|arbitrating disputes]] between competing colonial powers and in [[Counter-Reformation|opposing]] the [[Reformation]].

The Italian Renaissance is best known for its achievements in [[Italian Renaissance painting|painting]], [[Italian Renaissance architecture|architecture]], [[Italian Renaissance sculpture|sculpture]], [[Italian Renaissance literature|literature]], [[Renaissance music|music]], [[Renaissance philosophy|philosophy]], [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]] and [[Renaissance exploration|exploration]]. Italy became the recognized European leader in all these areas by the late 15th century, during the [[Peace of Lodi]] (1454-1494) agreed between Italian states. The Italian Renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as domestic disputes and foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the [[Italian Wars]] (1494-1559). However, the ideas and ideals of the Italian Renaissance endured and spread into the rest of Europe, setting off the [[Northern Renaissance]]. Italian explorers from the [[maritime republics]] served under the auspices of European monarchs, ushering the Age of discovery. The most famous among them are [[Christopher Columbus]] who served for Spain, [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] for France, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] for Portugal, and [[John Cabot]] for England. Italian universities attracted [[polymaths]] and scholars such as [[Copernicus]], [[Vesalius]], [[Galileo]] and [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricelli]], playing a key role in the [[scientific revolution]]. Various events and dates of the 17th century, such as the conclusion of the [[European Wars of Religion]] in 1648, have been proposed for the end of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=SvYACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62&amp;dq=peace+of+westphalia+marks+the+end+of+the+Renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA3ICuifLVAhXKCsAKHRbbBCgQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=peace%20of%20westphalia%20marks%20the%20end%20of%20the%20Renaissance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts of [[Renaissance literature]] usually begin with the three great poets of the 14th century: [[Dante Alighieri]] (''[[Divine Comedy]]''), [[Petrarch]] (''[[Canzoniere]]'') and [[Boccaccio]] (''[[Decameron]]''). Famous vernacular poets of the Renaissance include the renaissance epic authors [[Luigi Pulci]] (author of ''[[Morgante]]''), [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]] (''[[Orlando Innamorato]]''), [[Ludovico Ariosto]] (''[[Orlando Furioso]]'') and [[Torquato Tasso]] (''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]''). 15th-century writers such as the poet [[Poliziano]] and the Platonist philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] made extensive translations from both Latin and Greek. In the early 16th century, [[Baldassare Castiglione|Castiglione]] laid out his vision of the ideal gentleman and lady in ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'', while [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] cast a jaundiced eye on "''la verità effettuale della cosa''"—the actual truth of things—in ''[[The Prince]]'', composed, in humanistic style, chiefly of parallel ancient and modern examples of [[Virtù]]. Historians of the period include Machiavelli himself, his friend and critic [[Francesco Guicciardini]] and [[Giovanni Botero]] (''[[The Reason of State]]''). The Aldine Press, founded by the printer [[Aldo Manuzio]], active in Venice, developed [[Italic type]] and portable printed books that could be carried in one's pocket, as well as being the first to publish editions of books in Ancient Greek. Venice also became the birthplace of the [[Commedia dell'Arte]].

[[Italian Renaissance art]] exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting and sculpture for centuries afterwards, with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Donatello]], [[Giotto di Bondone]], [[Masaccio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Perugino]], [[Botticelli]], and [[Titian]]. The same is true for [[Renaissance architecture|architecture]], as practiced by [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Andrea Palladio]], and [[Bramante]]. Their works include, to name only a few, the [[Florence Cathedral]], [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, and the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in Rimini, as well as [[Renaissance architecture|several private residences]]. The musical era of the Italian Renaissance was defined by the [[Roman School]] and later by the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]] and the birth of [[Opera]] in Florence. In [[Modern philosophy#Modern Western philosophy|philosophy]], thinkers such as Galileo, Machiavelli, [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]], emphasized [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[humanism]], thus rejecting dogma and [[scholasticism]].

==Origins and background==
===Northern and Central Italy in the Late Middle Ages===
By the [[Late Middle Ages]] (circa 1300 onward), [[Latium]], the former heartland of the [[Roman Empire]], and [[southern Italy]] were generally poorer than the North. [[Rome]] was a city of ancient ruins, and the [[Papal States]] were loosely administered, and vulnerable to external interference such as that of France, and later Spain. The Papacy was affronted when the [[Avignon Papacy]] was created in southern France as a consequence of pressure from [[Philip IV of France|King Philip the Fair]] of France. In the south, [[Sicily]] had for some time been under foreign domination, [[History of Islam in southern Italy|by the Arabs]] and [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|then the Normans]]. Sicily had prospered for 150 years during the [[Emirate of Sicily]] and later for two centuries during the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Kingdom]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Hohenstaufen Kingdom]], but had declined by the late Middle Ages.

In contrast, Northern and Central Italy had become far more prosperous, and it has been calculated that the region was among the richest of [[Europe]]. The [[Crusades]] had built lasting trade links to the [[Levant]], and the [[Fourth Crusade]] had done much to destroy the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Roman Empire]] as a commercial rival to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]. The main trade routes from the east passed through the Byzantine Empire or the [[Arab World|Arab lands]] and onward to the ports of [[Genoa]], [[Pisa]], and [[Venice]]. Luxury goods bought in the Levant, such as spices, dyes, and silks were imported to Italy and then resold throughout Europe. Moreover, the inland [[city-state]]s profited from the rich agricultural land of the [[Po River|Po]] valley. From France, Germany, and the Low Countries, through the medium of the [[Champagne fairs]], land and river trade routes brought goods such as [[wool]], [[wheat]], and [[precious metal]]s into the region. The extensive trade that stretched from [[Egypt]] to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] generated substantial surpluses that allowed significant investment in mining and agriculture. Thus, while northern Italy was not richer in resources than many other parts of Europe, the level of development, stimulated by trade, allowed it to prosper. In particular, Florence became one of the wealthiest of the cities of Northern Italy,  mainly due to its woolen textile production, developed under the supervision of its dominant trade [[guild]], the ''[[Arte della Lana]]''. Wool was imported from Northern Europe (and in the 16th century from Spain)&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; and together with [[dye]]s from the east were used to make high quality textiles.

The Italian trade routes that covered the Mediterranean and beyond were also major conduits of culture and knowledge. The
[[Transmission of the Classics|recovery of lost Greek classics]] (and, to a lesser extent, Arab advancements on them) following the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusader]] [[Siege of Constantinople|conquest of the Byzantine heartlands]], revitalized [[medieval philosophy]] in the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], just as the [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|refugee Byzantine scholars]] who migrated to Italy during and following the Turkish conquest of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] between the 12th and 15th centuries were important in sparking the new linguistic studies of the Renaissance, in newly created [[Academy|academies]] in Florence and Venice. Humanist scholars searched monastic libraries for ancient manuscripts and recovered [[Tacitus]] and other Latin authors. The rediscovery of [[Vitruvius]] meant that the architectural principles of Antiquity could be observed once more, and Renaissance artists were encouraged, in the atmosphere of humanist optimism, to excel the achievements of the Ancients, like [[Apelles]], of whom they read.

===Thirteenth-century===
In the 13th century, much of Europe experienced strong economic growth. The trade routes of the Italian states linked with those of established Mediterranean ports and eventually the [[Hanseatic League]] of the Baltic and northern regions of Europe to create a network economy in Europe for the first time since the 4th century. The  [[Italian city-states|city-states of Italy]] expanded greatly during this period and grew in power to become de facto fully independent of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; apart from the [[Kingdom of Naples]], outside powers kept their armies out of Italy. During this period, the modern commercial infrastructure developed, with [[double-entry book-keeping]], [[joint stock companies]], an international [[banking]] system, a systematized [[foreign exchange market]], [[insurance]], and [[government debt]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Florence became the centre of this financial industry and the gold [[Italian coin florin|florin]] became the main currency of international trade.

The new mercantile governing class, who gained their position through financial skill, adapted to their purposes the [[feudal]] aristocratic model that had dominated Europe in the Middle Ages. A feature of the High Middle Ages in Northern Italy was the rise of the [[Medieval commune|urban communes]] which had broken from the control by bishops and local counts. In much of the region, the [[landed nobility]] was poorer than the urban patriarchs in the High Medieval money economy whose inflationary rise left land-holding aristocrats impoverished. The increase in trade during the early Renaissance enhanced these characteristics. The decline of feudalism and the rise of cities influenced each other; for example, the demand for luxury goods led to an increase in trade, which led to greater numbers of tradesmen becoming wealthy, who, in turn, demanded more luxury goods. This atmosphere of assumed luxury of the time created a need for the creation of visual symbols of wealth, an important way to show a family’s affluence and taste.

This change also gave the merchants almost complete control of the governments of the Italian city-states, again enhancing trade. One of the most important effects of this political control was security. Those that grew extremely wealthy in a feudal state ran constant risk of running afoul of the monarchy and having their lands confiscated, as famously occurred to [[Jacques Coeur]] in France. The northern states also kept many medieval laws that severely hampered commerce, such as those against [[usury]], and prohibitions on trading with non-Christians. In the city-states of Italy, these laws were repealed or rewritten.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourteenth-century collapse===
The 14th century saw a series of catastrophes that caused the European economy to go into recession. The [[Medieval Warm Period]] was ending as the transition to the [[Little Ice Age]] began.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 97; see also Andrew B. Appleby's "Epidemics and Famine in the Little Ice Age." ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History.'' Vol. 10 No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This change in climate saw agricultural output decline significantly, leading to repeated [[famine]]s, exacerbated by the rapid population growth of the earlier era. The [[Hundred Years' War]] between England and France disrupted trade throughout northwest Europe, most notably when, in 1345, King [[Edward III of England]] repudiated his debts, contributing to the collapse of the two largest Florentine banks, those of the [[Bardi family|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi]]. In the east, war was also disrupting trade routes, as the [[Ottoman Empire]] began to expand throughout the region. Most devastating, though, was the [[Black Death]] that decimated the populations of the densely populated cities of Northern Italy and returned at intervals thereafter. Florence, for instance, which had a pre-plague population of 45,000 decreased over the next 47 years by 25–50%.&lt;ref&gt;Olea, Ricardo A, Christakos, George, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3659/is_200506/ai_n15845444/pg_4 "Duration of Urban Mortality for the 14th-Century Black Death Epidemic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206150835/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3659/is_200506/ai_n15845444/pg_4 |date=2008-12-06 }}, ''Human Biology'',  Jun 2005. The population level of Florence is controversial see also Ziegler (1969, pp. 51-52), Chandler 1987, pp. 16-18, and Gottfried 1983, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread disorder followed, including a revolt of Florentine textile workers, the ''[[ciompi]]'', in 1378.

It was during this period of instability that the Renaissance authors such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Petrarch]] lived, and the first stirrings of Renaissance art were to be seen, notably in the realism of [[Giotto]]. Paradoxically, some of these disasters would help establish the Renaissance. The [[Black Death]] wiped out a third of Europe's population. The resulting labour shortage increased wages and the reduced population was therefore much wealthier, better fed, and, significantly, had more surplus money to spend on luxury goods.  As incidences of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] began to decline in the early 15th century, Europe's devastated population once again began to grow.  The new demand for products and services also helped create a growing class of [[bankers]], merchants, and skilled [[artisan]]s.  The horrors of the Black Death and the seeming inability of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] to provide relief would contribute to a decline of church influence. Additionally, the collapse of the [[Compagnia dei Bardi|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi Bank|Peruzzi]] banks would open the way for the [[Medici]] to rise to prominence in Florence. [[Roberto Sabatino Lopez]] argues that the economic collapse was a crucial cause of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Robert Sabatino. "Hard Times and Investment in Culture."&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, in a more prosperous era, businessmen would have quickly reinvested their earnings in order to make more money in a climate favourable to investment. However, in the leaner years of the 14th century, the wealthy found few promising investment opportunities for their earnings and instead chose to spend more on culture and art.

Another popular explanation for the Italian Renaissance is the thesis, first advanced by historian [[Hans Baron]],&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Hans. "The Crisis of the Early Italian Renaissance". Princeton University Press, March 1, 1966. {{ISBN|0-691-00752-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that states that the primary impetus of the early Renaissance was the long-running series of [[Italian Wars|wars]] between Florence and Milan. By the late 14th century, Milan had become a centralized monarchy under the control of the [[house of Visconti|Visconti]] family. [[Giangaleazzo Visconti]], who ruled the city from 1378 to 1402, was renowned both for his cruelty and for his abilities, and set about building an empire in Northern Italy. He launched a long series of wars, with Milan steadily conquering neighbouring states and defeating the various coalitions led by Florence that sought in vain to halt the advance. This culminated in the 1402 siege of Florence, when it looked as though the city was doomed to fall, before Giangaleazzo suddenly died and his empire collapsed.

Baron's thesis suggests that during these long wars, the leading figures of Florence rallied the people by presenting the war as one between the free republic and a despotic monarchy, between the ideals of the Greek and Roman Republics and those of the Roman Empire and Medieval kingdoms. For Baron, the most important figure in crafting this ideology was [[Leonardo Bruni]]. This time of crisis in Florence was the period when the most influential figures of the early Renaissance were coming of age, such as [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]], [[Donatello]], [[Masolino]], and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. Inculcated with this republican ideology they later went on to advocate republican ideas that were to have an enormous impact on the Renaissance.

{{Main|Italian Wars}}
[[File:Piero, ritratto di sigismondo malatesta.jpg|thumb|[[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta|Pandolfo Malatesta]] (1417–1468), lord of [[Rimini]], by [[Piero della Francesca]]. Malatesta was a capable ''[[condottiere]]'', following the tradition of his family. He was hired by the [[Venice|Venetians]] to fight against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] (unsuccessfully) in 1465, and was patron of [[Leone Battista Alberti]], whose ''[[Tempio Malatestiano]]'' at Rimini is one of the first entirely classical buildings of the Renaissance.]]
Northern Italy and upper Central Italy were divided into a number of warring [[Italian city-states|city-states]], the most powerful being [[Milan]], [[Florence]], [[Pisa]], [[Siena]], [[Genoa]], [[Ferrara]], [[Mantua]], [[Verona]] and [[Venice]].  High Medieval Northern Italy was further divided by the long-running battle for supremacy between the forces of the Papacy and of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]: each city aligned itself with one faction or the other, yet was divided internally between the two warring parties, [[Guelf]]s and [[Ghibelline]]s.  Warfare between the states was common, invasion from outside Italy confined to intermittent sorties of [[Holy Roman Emperors]]. Renaissance politics developed from this background. Since the 13th century, as armies became primarily composed of [[mercenaries]], prosperous city-states could field considerable forces, despite their low populations. In the course of the 15th century, the most powerful city-states annexed their smaller neighbors. Florence took [[Pisa]] in 1406, Venice captured [[Padua]] and [[Verona]], while the [[Duchy of Milan]] annexed a number of nearby areas including [[Pavia]] and [[Parma]].

The first part of the Renaissance saw almost constant warfare on land and sea as the city-states vied for preeminence.  On land, these wars were primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as ''[[Condottiere|condottieri]]'', bands of soldiers drawn from around Europe, but especially Germany and Switzerland, led largely by Italian captains.  The mercenaries were not willing to risk their lives unduly, and war became one largely of sieges and maneuvering, occasioning few pitched battles. It was also in the interest of mercenaries on both sides to prolong any conflict, to continue their employment.  Mercenaries were also a constant threat to their employers; if not paid, they often turned on their patron.  If it became obvious that a state was entirely dependent on mercenaries, the temptation was great for the mercenaries to take over the running of it themselves—this occurred on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

At sea, Italian city-states sent many fleets out to do battle. The main contenders were Pisa, Genoa, and Venice, but after a long conflict the Genoese succeeded in reducing Pisa.  Venice proved to be a more powerful adversary, and with the decline of Genoese power during the 15th century Venice became pre-eminent on the seas. In response to threats from the landward side, from the early 15th century Venice developed an increased interest in controlling the ''terrafirma'' as the Venetian Renaissance opened.

On land, decades of fighting saw Florence, Milan and Venice emerge as the dominant players, and these three powers finally set aside their differences and agreed to the [[Peace of Lodi]] in 1454, which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries.  This peace would hold for the next forty years, and Venice's unquestioned hegemony over the sea also led to unprecedented peace for much of the rest of the 15th century. In the beginning of the 15th century, adventurer and traders such as [[Niccolò Da Conti]] (1395–1469) traveled as far as [[Southeast Asia]] and back, bringing fresh knowledge on the state of the world, presaging further European voyages of exploration in the years to come.

===Florence under the Medici===
{{Main|House of Medici}}
Until the late 14th century, prior to the Medici, Florence's leading family were the [[House of Albizzi]]. In 1293 the Ordinances of Justice were enacted which effectively became the constitution of the republic of Florence throughout the Italian Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bartlett, ''The Italian Renaissance'', Chapter 7, p.37, Volume II, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The city's numerous luxurious [[Palace#Italy|palazzi]] were becoming surrounded by [[townhouses]], built by the ever prospering merchant class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutflorence.com/history-of-Florence.html |title=History of Florence |publisher=Aboutflorence.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1298, one of the leading banking families of Europe, the Bonsignoris, were bankrupted and so the city of Siena lost her status as the banking center of Europe to Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challengers of the Albizzi family were the [[Medici]]s, first under [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]], later under his son [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo di Giovanni de' Medici]]. The Medici controlled the [[Medici bank]]—then Europe's largest bank—and an array of other enterprises in Florence and elsewhere. In 1433, the Albizzi managed to have Cosimo exiled.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, Roger J. ''Severing the Neck of Pride: Donatello's "Judith and Holofernes" and the Recollection of Albizzi Shame in Medicean Florence ''. Artibus et Historiae, Volume 22, Edit 44, 2001. pp. 23-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, however, saw a pro-Medici [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]] elected and Cosimo returned. The Medici became the town's leading family, a position they would hold for the next three centuries. Florence remained a republic until 1537, traditionally marking the end of the High Renaissance in Florence, but the instruments of republican government were firmly under the control of the Medici and their allies, save during the intervals after 1494 and 1527. Cosimo and Lorenzo rarely held official posts, but were the unquestioned leaders.

Cosimo de' Medici was highly popular among the citizenry, mainly for bringing an era of stability and prosperity to the town. One of his most important accomplishments was negotiating the [[Peace of Lodi]] with [[Francesco Sforza]] ending the decades of war with Milan and bringing stability to much of Northern Italy. Cosimo was also an important patron of the arts, directly and indirectly, by the influential example he set.

Cosimo was succeeded by his sickly son [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]], who died after five years in charge of the city. In 1469 the reins of power passed to Cosimo's twenty-one-year-old grandson [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]], who would become known as "Lorenzo the Magnificent." Lorenzo was the first of the family to be educated from an early age in the humanist tradition and is best known as one of the Renaissance's most important patrons of the arts. Under Lorenzo, the Medici rule was formalized with the creation of a new [[Council of Seventy]], which Lorenzo headed. The republican institutions continued, but they lost all power. Lorenzo was less successful than his illustrious forebears in business, and the Medici commercial empire was slowly eroded. Lorenzo continued the alliance with Milan, but relations with the papacy soured, and in 1478, Papal agents allied with the [[Pazzi]] family in an attempt to assassinate Lorenzo. Although the plot failed, Lorenzo's young brother, [[Giuliano di Piero de' Medici|Giuliano]], was killed, and the failed assassination led to a war with the Papacy and was used as justification to further centralize power in Lorenzo's hands.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006]. {{ISBN|5-85050-825-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread===
Renaissance ideals first spread from Florence to the neighbouring states of [[Tuscany]] such as [[Siena]] and [[Lucca]]. The Tuscan culture soon became the model for all the states of Northern Italy, and the Tuscan variety of Italian came to predominate throughout the region, especially in literature. In 1447 [[Francesco Sforza]] came to power in [[Milan]] and rapidly transformed that still medieval city into a major centre of art and learning that drew [[Leone Battista Alberti]]. [[Venice]], one of the wealthiest cities due to its control of the Adriatic Sea, also became a centre for Renaissance culture, especially architecture. Smaller courts brought Renaissance patronage to lesser cities, which developed their characteristic arts: [[Ferrara]], [[Mantua]] under the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]], and [[Urbino]] under [[Federico da Montefeltro]]. In [[Naples]], the Renaissance was ushered in under the patronage of [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso I]] who conquered Naples in 1443 and encouraged artists like [[Francesco Laurana]] and [[Antonello da Messina]] and writers like the poet [[Jacopo Sannazaro]] and the humanist scholar [[Angelo Poliziano]].

In 1417 the Papacy returned to Rome, but that once imperial city remained poor and largely in ruins through the first years of the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="rome"&gt;Burke 1999, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; The great transformation began under [[Pope Nicholas V]], who became pontiff in 1447.  He launched a dramatic rebuilding effort that would eventually see much of the city renewed.  The humanist scholar Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini became [[Pope Pius II]] in 1458. As the papacy fell under the control of the wealthy families, such as the [[Medici]] and the [[Borgia]]s&lt;!--Valencia!--&gt; the spirit of Renaissance art and philosophy came to dominate the Vatican.  [[Pope Sixtus IV]] continued Nicholas' work, most famously ordering the construction of the [[Sistine Chapel]].  The popes also became increasingly secular rulers as the [[Papal States]] were forged into a centralized power by a series of "warrior popes".

The nature of the Renaissance also changed in the late 15th century.  The Renaissance ideal was fully adopted by the ruling classes and the aristocracy.  In the early Renaissance artists were seen as craftsmen with little prestige or recognition.  By the later Renaissance the top figures wielded great influence and could charge great fees.  A flourishing trade in Renaissance art developed.  While in the early Renaissance many of the leading artists were of lower- or middle-class origins, increasingly they became aristocrats.&lt;ref name="rome"/&gt;

===Wider population===
As a cultural movement, the Italian Renaissance affected only a small part of the population. Italy was the most urbanized region of Europe, but three quarters of the people were still rural peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; For this section of the population, life remained essentially unchanged from the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Classic [[feudalism]] had never been prominent in Northern Italy, and most peasants worked on private farms or as [[sharecropper]]s.  Some scholars see a trend towards [[refeudalization]] in the later Renaissance as the urban elites turned themselves into landed aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation differed in the  cities. These were dominated by a commercial elite; as exclusive as the aristocracy of any Medieval kingdom.  This group became the main patrons of and audience for Renaissance culture.  Below them there was a large class of artisans and guild members who lived comfortable lives and had significant power in the republican governments.  This was in sharp contrast to the rest of Europe where artisans were firmly in the lower class.  Literate and educated, this group did participate in the Renaissance culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest section of the urban population was the urban poor of semi-skilled workers and the unemployed.  Like the peasants, the Renaissance had little effect on them. Historians debate how easy it was to move between these groups during the Italian Renaissance. Examples of individuals who rose from humble beginnings can be instanced, but Burke notes two major studies in this area that have found that the data do not clearly demonstrate an increase in [[social mobility]]. Most historians feel that early in the Renaissance social mobility was quite high, but that it faded over the course of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Inequality in society was very high.  An upper-class figure would control hundreds of times more income than a servant or labourer.  Some historians see this unequal distribution of wealth as important to the Renaissance, as art patronage relies on the very wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pullan |first1=Brian S. |title=History of early Renaissance Italy:From the mid-thirteenth to the mid-fifteenth century |year=1973 |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |isbn=0-7139-0304-X |oclc=613989155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance was not a period of great social or economic change, only of cultural and ideological development.  It only touched a small fraction of the population, and in modern times this has led many historians, such as any that follow [[historical materialism]], to reduce the importance of the Renaissance in human history. These historians tend to think in terms of "[[Early Modern Europe]]" instead. Roger Osborne&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "The Renaissance is a difficult concept for historians because the history of Europe quite suddenly turns into a history of Italian painting, sculpture and architecture."

{{Details|Northern Renaissance}}
[[File:Clovio magi.jpg|thumb|[[Giulio Clovio]], ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' and ''[[Solomon]] Adored by the [[Queen of Sheba]]'' from the ''Farnese Hours,'' 1546]]
The end of the Renaissance is as imprecisely marked as its starting point.  For many, the rise to power in Florence of the austere monk [[Girolamo Savonarola]] in 1494-1498 marks the end of the city's flourishing; for others, the triumphant return of the Medici family to power in 1512 marks the beginning of the late phase in the Renaissance arts called [[Mannerism]].  Other accounts trace the end of the Italian Renaissance to the French invasions of the early 16th century and the subsequent conflict between France and Spanish rulers for control of Italian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Roger, Civilization: A New History of the Western World Pegasus, NY, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Savonarola rode to power on a widespread backlash over the secularism and indulgence of the Renaissance –&lt;ref&gt;Cast, David. "Review: Fra Girolamo Savonarola: Florentine Art and Renaissance Historiography by Ronald M. Steinberg". ''The Art Bulletin'', Volume 61, No. 1, March 1979. pp. 134-136.&lt;/ref&gt; his brief rule saw many works of art destroyed in the "[[Bonfire of the Vanities]]" in the centre of Florence.  With the Medici returned to power, now as [[Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], the counter movement in the church continued.  In 1542 the [[Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition]] was formed and a few years later the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' banned a wide array of Renaissance works of literature, which marks the end of the [[illuminated manuscript]] together with [[Giulio Clovio]], who is considered the greatest illuminator of the Italian High Renaissance, and arguably the last very notable artist in the long tradition of the illuminated manuscript, before some modern revivals.

Equally important was the end of stability with a series of foreign invasions of Italy known as the [[Italian Wars]] that would continue for several decades.  These began with the 1494 invasion by France that wreaked widespread devastation on Northern Italy and ended the independence of many of the city-states.  Most damaging was the May 6, 1527, Spanish and German troops' [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacking Rome]] that for two decades all but ended the role of the Papacy as the largest patron of Renaissance art and architecture.&lt;ref name="rome"/&gt;

While the Italian Renaissance was fading, the Northern Renaissance adopted many of its ideals and transformed its styles. A number of Italy's greatest artists chose to emigrate.  The most notable example was [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who left for France in 1516, but teams of lesser artists invited to transform the [[Château de Fontainebleau]] created the [[school of Fontainebleau]] that infused the style of the Italian Renaissance in France. From Fontainebleau, the new styles, transformed by [[Mannerism]], brought the Renaissance to [[Antwerp]] and thence throughout Northern Europe.

This spread north was also representative of a larger trend.  No longer was the Mediterranean Europe's most important trade route.  In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India, and from that date the primary route of goods from the Orient was through the Atlantic ports of Lisbon, Seville, Nantes, Bristol, and London.

===Literature and poetry===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance literature}}
The thirteenth-century Italian literary revolution helped set the stage for the Renaissance. Prior to the Renaissance, the [[Italian language]] was not the [[literary language]] in Italy.  It was only in the 13th century that Italian authors began writing in their native language rather than [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], or [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]].  The 1250s saw a major change in Italian poetry as the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]'' (''Sweet New Style'', which emphasized [[Platonic love|Platonic]] rather than [[courtly love]]) came into its own, pioneered by poets like [[Guittone d'Arezzo]] and [[Guido Guinizelli]].  Especially in [[poetry]], major changes in [[Italian literature]] had been taking place decades before the Renaissance truly began.
[[File:Santi di Tito - Niccolo Machiavelli's portrait headcrop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (1469–1527), the author of ''[[The Prince]]'' and prototypical [[Polymath|Renaissance man]]. Detail from a portrait by [[Santi di Tito]].]]
With the printing of books initiated in Venice by [[Aldus Manutius]], an increasing number of works began to be published in the Italian language in addition to the flood of Latin and Greek texts that constituted the mainstream of the Italian Renaissance.  The source for these works expanded beyond works of [[theology]] and towards the pre-Christian eras of [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]].  This is not to say that no religious works were published in this period:  [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' reflects a distinctly medieval world view.  [[Christianity]] remained a major influence for artists and authors, with the [[classics]] coming into their own as a second primary influence.

In the early Italian Renaissance, much of the focus was on translating and studying classic works from Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Renaissance authors were not content to rest on the laurels of ancient authors, however.  Many authors attempted to integrate the methods and styles of the ancient Greeks into their own works.  Among the most emulated Romans are [[Cicero]], [[Horace]], [[Sallust]], and [[Virgil]].  Among the Greeks, [[Aristotle]], [[Homer]], and [[Plato]] were now being read in the original for the first time since the 4th century, though Greek compositions were few.

The literature and poetry of the Renaissance was largely influenced by the developing science and philosophy.  The humanist [[Francesco Petrarch]], a key figure in the renewed sense of scholarship, was also an accomplished poet, publishing several important works of poetry.  He wrote poetry in [[Latin]], notably the [[Punic War]] epic ''[[Africa (epic poem)|Africa]]'', but is today remembered for his works in the Italian [[vernacular]], especially the ''[[Canzoniere]]'', a collection of love [[sonnet]]s dedicated to his unrequited love Laura.  He was the foremost writer of [[sonnet]]s in Italian, and translations of his work into English by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]] established the sonnet form in that country, where it was employed by [[William Shakespeare]] and countless other poets.

Petrarch's disciple, [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], became a major author in his own right.  His major work was the ''[[Decameron]]'', a collection of 100 stories told by ten storytellers who have fled to the outskirts of Florence to escape the [[black plague]] over ten nights.  The ''[[Decameron]]'' in particular and Boccaccio's work in general were a major source of inspiration and plots for many English authors in the Renaissance, including [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare]].

Aside from Christianity, [[classical antiquity]], and scholarship, a fourth influence on Renaissance literature was politics. The political philosopher [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s most famous works are ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', ''[[Florentine Histories]]'' and finally ''[[The Prince]]'', which has become so well known in Western society that the term "Machiavellian" has come to refer to the ''[[realpolitik]]'' advocated by the book. However, what is ordinarily called "Machiavellianism" is a simplified textbook view of this single work rather than an accurate term for his philosophy. Further, it is not at all clear that Machiavelli himself was the apologist for immorality as whom he is often portrayed: the basic problem is the apparent contradiction between the monarchism of ''The Prince'' and the republicanism of the ''Discourses''. Regardless, along with many other Renaissance works, ''The Prince'' remains a relevant and influential work of literature today.

One role of [[Petrarch]] is as the founder of a new method of scholarship,  Renaissance Humanism.

Petrarch encouraged the study of the [[Latin]] classics and carried his copy of Homer about, at a loss to find someone to teach him to read Greek. An essential step in the humanist education being propounded by scholars like [[Pico della Mirandola]] was the hunting down of lost or forgotten manuscripts that were known only by reputation.  These endeavors were greatly aided by the wealth of Italian patricians, merchant-princes and despots, who would spend substantial sums building [[libraries]].  Discovering the past had become fashionable and it was a passionate affair pervading the upper reaches of society.  ''I go'', said [[Cyriac of Ancona]], ''I go to awake the dead''. As the Greek works were acquired, manuscripts found, libraries and [[museum]]s formed, the age of the [[printing press]] was dawning.  The works of Antiquity were translated from Greek and Latin into the contemporary modern languages throughout Europe, finding a receptive middle-class audience, which might be, like Shakespeare, "with little Latin and less Greek".

While concern for [[philosophy]], art and literature all increased greatly in the Renaissance the period is usually seen as one of scientific backwardness.  The reverence for classical sources further enshrined the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] views of the universe. Humanism stressed that nature came to be viewed as an animate spiritual creation that was not governed by laws or mathematics.  At the same time philosophy lost much of its rigour as the rules of [[logic]] and deduction were seen as secondary to intuition and emotion.

===Science===
{{Main|History of science in the Renaissance}}
According to some recent scholarship, the 'father of modern science' is [[Leonardo da Vinci]] whose experiments and clear scientific method earn him this title, Italian universities such as Padua, Bologna and Pisa were scientific centres of renown and with many northern European students, the science of the Renaissance moved to Northern Europe and flourished there, with such figures as [[Copernicus]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Descartes]].   [[Galileo]], a contemporary of Bacon and Descartes, made an immense contribution to scientific thought and experimentation, paving the way for the scientific revolution that later flourished in Northern Europe.
Bodies were also stolen from gallows and examined by many like Vesalius, a professor of anatomy. This allowed them to create accurate skeleton models and correct previously believed theories. For example, many thought that the [[human]] [[Mandible|jawbone]] was made up of two bones, as they had seen this on [[animals]]. However through examining human corpses they were able to understand that humans actually have only one.

===Sculpture and painting===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance painting}}
[[File:Last judgement.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'', 1536-1541, by [[Michelangelo]]]]
In painting, the false dawn of [[Giotto]]'s [[Trecento]] realism, his fully three-dimensional figures occupying a rational space, and his humanist interest in expressing the individual personality rather than the iconic images,&lt;ref&gt;Hayden B. J. Maginnis, ''Painting in the Age of Giotto: A Historical Reevaluation'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by a retreat into conservative late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Ethan Matt Kavaler, "Renaissance Gothic: Pictures of Geometry and Narratives of Ornament," ''Art History,'' Feb 2006, Vol. 29 Issue 1, pp 1-46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Renaissance in painting began anew, in Florence and Tuscany, with the frescoes of [[Masaccio]], then the [[panel painting]]s and [[fresco]]s of [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Paolo Uccello]] which began to enhance the realism of their work by using new techniques in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], thus representing three [[dimension]]s in two-dimensional art more authentically. The figures in Masaccio's frescos painted between 1425 and his death in 1428 have a plasticity unknown up to that point in time.  Compared to the flatness of Gothic painting, his pictures were revolutionary.  Piero della Francesca wrote treatises on scientific perspective. The creation of credible space allowed artists to also focus on the accurate representation of the human body and on naturalistic landscapes.  Completed in 1460, the [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]] of [[Andrea Mantegna]], was probably the first good example of Renaissance painting in Northern Italy and became a model for other painters in the region.  At the turn of the 16th century, especially in Northern Italy, artists also began to use new techniques in the manipulation of light and darkness, such as the tone contrast evident in many of [[Titian]]'s portraits and the development of [[sfumato]] and [[chiaroscuro]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Giorgione]].  The period also saw the first secular (non-[[religion|religious]]) themes.  There has been much debate as to the degree of [[secularism]] in the Renaissance, which had been emphasized by early 20th-century writers like Jacob Burckhardt, based on, among other things, the presence of  a relatively small number of mythological paintings.  Those of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], notably ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', are now among the best known, although he was deeply religious (becoming a follower of Savonarola) and the great majority of his output was of traditional religious paintings or portraits.&lt;ref name="Frederick Hartt 2003"&gt;Frederick Hartt,  and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In sculpture, [[Donatello]]'s (1386–1466)  study of classical sculpture led to his development of classicizing positions (such as the [[contrapposto]] pose) and subject matter (like the unsupported nude – his second sculpture of ''[[Donatello's David|David]]'' was the first free-standing bronze nude created in Europe since the Roman Empire.)  The progress made by Donatello was influential on all who followed; perhaps the greatest of whom is [[Michelangelo]], whose [[Michelangelo's David|''David'']] of 1500 is also a male nude study;   more naturalistic than Donatello's and with greater emotional intensity. Both sculptures are standing in ''contrapposto'', their weight shifted to one leg.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Blake McHam, ed. ''Looking at Italian Renaissance Sculpture'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The period known as the High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundrum "Renaissance and Mannerism" in ''Masterpieces of Western Art'', Tashen, 2007. Page 147&lt;/ref&gt; and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Raunch "Painting of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy" in ''The Italian Renaissance: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Drawing'', Konemann, Cologne, 1995. Pg. 308; Wundrum Pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; the realistic depiction of both physical&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  and psychological features,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, [[sfumato]] (softening the transition between colours) and [[chiaroscuro]] (contrast between light and dark),&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 148; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; in a single unifying style&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture''; Harry N. Abrams Incorporated, New York, 1985, pg. 601; Wundrum pg. 147; Marilyn Stokstad ''Art History'', Third Edition, Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey, 2008. Pg 659&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Pg. 659&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous painters from this phase are Leonardo da Vinci, [[Raphael]], and Michelangelo and their images, including Leonardo's the [[Last Supper (da Vinci)|''Last Supper'']] and ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' and Michelangelo's ''[[Sistine Chapel Ceiling]]'' are the masterpieces of the period and among the most widely known works of art in the world.&lt;ref name="Frederick Hartt 2003"/&gt;

High Renaissance painting evolved into [[Mannerism]], especially in Florence.  Mannerist artists, who consciously rebelled against the principles of High Renaissance, tend to represent elongated figures in illogical spaces.   Modern scholarship has recognized the capacity of Mannerist art to convey strong (often religious) emotion where the High Renaissance failed to do so. Some of the main artists of this period are [[Pontormo]], [[Bronzino]], [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Parmigianino]] and Raphael's pupil [[Giulio Romano]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Turner, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Italian Renaissance and Mannerist Art'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:Saint Peter's Basilica facade, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Basilica]]. The dome, completed in 1590, was designed by [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], architect, painter and poet.]]
{{Main|Italian Renaissance and Mannerist architecture}}
In [[Florence]], the Renaissance style was introduced with a revolutionary but incomplete monument in Rimini by [[Leone Battista Alberti]].  Some of the earliest buildings showing Renaissance characteristics are [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|church of San Lorenzo]] and the [[Pazzi Chapel]]. The interior of ''Santo Spirito'' expresses a new sense of light, clarity and spaciousness, which is typical of the early Italian Renaissance.  Its architecture reflects the philosophy of [[Humanism]], the enlightenment and clarity of mind as opposed to the darkness and spirituality of the Middle Ages.  The revival of classical antiquity can best be illustrated by the [[Palazzo Rucellai]].  Here the [[pilaster]]s follow the superposition of [[classical orders]], with  [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] on the ground floor, [[Ionic order|Ionic]] capitals on the ''[[piano nobile]]'' and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals on the uppermost floor. Soon, Renaissance architects favored grand, large domes over tall and imposing spires, doing away with the Gothic style of the predating ages.

In Mantua, [[Leone Battista Alberti]] ushered in the new antique style, though his culminating work, [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|Sant'Andrea]], was not begun until 1472, after the architect's death.

[[File:PalladioBramanteTempietto1570.jpg|thumb|[[Donato Bramante|Bramante]]'s ''Tempietto'' in San Pietro in Montorio, Rome, 1502]]
The High Renaissance, as we call the style today, was introduced to [[Rome]] with [[Donato Bramante]]'s [[San Pietro in Montorio|Tempietto at San Pietro in Montorio]] (1502) and his original centrally planned [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1506), which was the most notable architectural commission of the era, influenced by almost all notable Renaissance artists, including [[Michelangelo]] and [[Giacomo della Porta]].  The beginning of the late Renaissance in 1550 was marked by the development of a new column order by [[Andrea Palladio]].  Colossal columns that were two or more stories tall decorated the [[facade]]s.

===Music===
{{Main|Renaissance music}}
In Italy during the 14th century there was an explosion of musical activity that corresponded in scope and level of innovation to the activity in the other arts.  Although [[musicologist]]s typically group the music of the [[Trecento]] (music of the 14th century) with the late [[Medieval music|medieval]] period, it included features which align with the early Renaissance in important ways:  an increasing emphasis on secular sources, styles and forms; a spreading of culture away from ecclesiastical institutions to the nobility, and even to the common people; and a quick development of entirely new techniques.  The principal forms were the [[Madrigal (Trecento)|Trecento madrigal]], the [[caccia (music)|caccia]], and the [[ballata]]. Overall, the musical style of the period is sometimes labelled as the "Italian [[ars nova]]." From the early 15th century to the middle of the 16th century, the center of innovation in sacred music was in the [[Low Countries]], and a flood of talented composers came to Italy from this region.  Many of them sang in either the papal choir in Rome or the choirs at the numerous chapels of the aristocracy, in [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Milan]], [[Ferrara]] and elsewhere; and they brought their [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style with them, influencing many native Italian composers during their stay.

The predominant forms of church music during the period were the [[mass (music)|mass]] and the [[motet]].  By far the most famous composer of church music in 16th-century Italy was [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], the most prominent member of the [[Roman School]], whose style of smooth, emotionally cool polyphony was to become the defining sound of the late 16th century, at least for generations of 19th- and 20th-century musicologists.  Other Italian composers of the late 16th century focused on composing the main secular form of the era, the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]:  and for almost a hundred years these secular songs for multiple singers were distributed all over Europe.  Composers of madrigals included [[Jacques Arcadelt]], at the beginning of the age, [[Cipriano de Rore]], in the middle of the century, and [[Luca Marenzio]], [[Philippe de Monte]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]], and [[Claudio Monteverdi]] at the end of the era. Italy was also a centre of innovation in instrumental music.  By the early 16th century keyboard improvisation came to be greatly valued, and numerous composers of virtuoso keyboard music appeared.  Many familiar instruments were invented and perfected in late Renaissance Italy, such as the [[violin]], the earliest forms of which came into use in the 1550s.

By the late 16th century Italy was the musical centre of Europe.  Almost all of the innovations which were to define the transition to the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period originated in northern Italy in the last few decades of the century.  In Venice, the [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] productions of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], and associated instrumental music, moved north into Germany; in Florence, the [[Florentine Camerata]] developed [[monody]], the important precursor to [[opera]], which itself first appeared around 1600; and the avant-garde, [[mannerism|manneristic]] style of the [[Ferrara school]], which migrated to [[Naples]] and elsewhere through the music of [[Carlo Gesualdo]], was to be the final statement of the polyphonic vocal music of the Renaissance.

'''Library.nu''', previously called '''ebooksclub.org''' from 2004 to 2007 and '''gigapedia.com''' from 2007 to 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gigapedia: The greatest, largest and the best website for downloading eBooks|url=http://vikas-gupta.in/2009/08/10/gigapedia-the-greatest-largest-and-the-best-website-for-downloading-free-e-books/|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a popular linking website. It was accused of [[copyright infringement]] and it was shut down by court order on February 15, 2012. According to the takedown notice, it hosted some 400,000 ebooks.

==Operators==
According to an article posted in the British ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', investigators believed that library.nu was operated by [[Ireland|Irish]] nationals, possibly from [[Galway]], through a server in [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;"Irish-run website investigated over ebook piracy operation." [[Sunday Times]] [London, England] 18 Dec. 2011: 6. Academic OneFile. Web. 20 Dec. 2011.[http://pastebin.com/wd1ym2PB]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injunction==
This website was targeted by coordinated legal action from 17 publishers who obtained an [[injunction]] from a [[Munich]] court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/08c911d4-57f4-11e1-ae89-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1nCt6bKWx|title=File sharers targeted over ebooks|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/book-publishers-shut-down-library-nu-and-ifile-it-120215/|title=Book Publishers 'Shut Down' Library.nu and iFile-it - TorrentFreak|work=TorrentFreak}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the claimed infringing files were hosted on the iFile.it [[file hosting service]], whose representatives however disclaimed a close relationship with Library.nu. In contrast, a representative of a private intellectual property agency hired by the book publishers stated that the "owners and directors of iFile.it" were the persons whose names appeared on the receipts of [[PayPal]] donations to Library.nu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/15/librarynu-book-downloading-injunction_n_1280383.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Andrew | last=Losowsky | title=Book Downloading Site Targeted By Publishers | date=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[TorrentFreak]], "the legal team of the publishers estimated the revenue based on page impressions as well as estimated income from premium accounts, but this figure is laughable according to the iFile.it owner, which makes sense considering the site’s modest size." The iFile.it owner also told TorrentFreak that "they can barely cover the server costs with the revenue they make."&lt;ref name="tf"/&gt;

==Aftermath and alternative websites==
The URL "library.nu" was revoked by the [[.nu]] domain on 20 February 2012. Between the day of indictment and 24 February, library.nu redirected to [[Google Books]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9289">The following is a list of the '''highest-grossing second weekends for films'''. Usually by the second weekend, studios can have an idea of what the final gross may be now that factors such as word-of-mouth and increased competition are starting to show. Many films usually have big drops as they could be "frontloaded" as fans want to watch them on opening weekend to be first to see it, but some could stay relatively modest as word-of-mouth works in the films' favor. The following shows how much the film has dropped compared to its opening weekend. Like the highest-grossing openings, the list is dominated by recent films due to steadily increasing production and marketing budgets, and modern films opening on more screens. Another contributing factor is inflation not being taken into account.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2016}}
{{literature}}
'''Literary criticism''' (or '''literary studies''') is the study, [[evaluation]], and [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of [[literature]]. Modern literary criticism is often influenced by [[literary theory]], which is the [[philosophical analysis|philosophical discussion]] of literature's goals and methods. Though the two activities are closely related, literary [[critic]]s are not always, and have not always been, theorists.

Whether or not literary criticism should be considered a separate field of inquiry from [[literary theory]], or conversely from book reviewing, is a matter of some controversy. For example, the ''Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism|date=2005|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=0801880106|edition=2nd|location=Baltimore|oclc=54374476}}&lt;/ref&gt; draws no distinction between literary theory and literary criticism, and almost always uses the terms together to describe the same concept. Some critics consider literary criticism a practical application of literary theory, because criticism always deals directly with particular literary works, while theory may be more general or abstract.

Literary criticism is often published in essay or book form. Academic literary critics teach in literature departments and publish in [[academic journal]]s, and more popular critics publish their [[Book Review|reviews]] in broadly circulating periodicals such as the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', the ''[[Dublin Review of Books]]'', ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.

== History ==
=== Classical and medieval criticism ===
Literary criticism is thought to have existed as long as literature. In the 4th century BC [[Aristotle]] wrote the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', a typology and description of literary forms with many specific criticisms of contemporary works of art. ''Poetics'' developed for the first time the concepts of [[mimesis]] and [[catharsis]], which are still crucial in literary studies. [[Plato]]'s attacks on [[poetry]] as imitative, secondary, and false were formative as well. The Sanskrit ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' includes literary criticism on ancient [[Indian literature]] and Sanskrit drama.

Later classical and [[medieval]] criticism often focused on religious texts, and the several long religious traditions of [[hermeneutics]] and textual [[exegesis]] have had a profound influence on the study of secular texts. This was particularly the case for the literary traditions of the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Jewish literature]], [[Christian literature]] and [[Islamic literature]]. 

Literary criticism was also employed in other forms of medieval [[Arabic literature]] and [[Arabic poetry]] from the 9th century, notably by [[Al-Jahiz]] in his ''al-Bayan wa-'l-tabyin'' and ''al-Hayawan'', and by [[Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz]] in his ''Kitab al-Badi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Line: Classical Arabic Literary Critics on the Coherence and Unity of the Poem|last=van. Gelder|first=G. J. H.|date=1982|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=9004068546|location=Leiden|oclc=10350183|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance criticism ===
The literary criticism of the [[Renaissance]] developed classical ideas of unity of form and content into literary [[neoclassicism]], proclaiming literature as central to [[culture]], entrusting the poet and the author with preservation of a long literary tradition. The birth of Renaissance criticism was in 1498, with the recovery of classic texts, most notably, [[Giorgio Valla]]'s [[Latin]] translation of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Poetics''. The work of Aristotle, especially ''Poetics'', was the most important influence upon literary criticism until the late eighteenth century. [[Lodovico Castelvetro]] was one of the most influential Renaissance critics who wrote commentaries on Aristotle's ''Poetics'' in 1570.

=== Enlightenment criticism ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
In the Enlightenment period (1700s to 1800s), literary criticism became more popular. During this time period literacy rates started to rise in the public, no longer was reading exclusive for the wealthy or scholarly. With the rise of the literate public and swiftness of printing, criticism arose too. Reading was no longer viewed solely as educational or as a sacred source of religion; it was a form of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse|isbn=9781616084530|location=New York|oclc=277203534|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary criticism was influenced by the values and stylistic writing, including clear, bold, precise writing and the more controversial criteria of the author's religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=Regan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Regan |first1=Shaun|last2=Dawson|first2=Books|date=2013 |title=Reading 1759: Literary Culture in Mid-Eighteenth-Century Britain and France|publisher=Lewisburg [Pa.]: Bucknell University Press |pages=125–130|isbn=9781611484786}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critical reviews were published in many magazines, newspapers, and journals. Many works of Jonathan Swift were criticized including his book ''Gulliver's Travels'', which one critic described as "the detestable story of the Yahoos".&lt;ref name=Regan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Regan |first1=Shaun|last2=Dawson|first2=Books|date=2013 |title=Reading 1759: Literary Culture in Mid-Eighteenth-Century Britain and France|publisher=Lewisburg [Pa.]: Bucknell University Press |pages=125–130|isbn=9781611484786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th-century Romantic criticism ===
The British [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of the early nineteenth century introduced new [[aesthetic]] ideas to literary studies, including the idea that the object of literature need not always be beautiful, noble, or perfect, but that literature itself could elevate a common subject to the level of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. [[German Romanticism]], which followed closely after the late development of German [[classicism]], emphasized an aesthetic of fragmentation that can appear startlingly modern to the reader of English literature, and valued ''Witz'' – that is, "wit" or "humor" of a certain sort – more highly than the serious Anglophone Romanticism. The late nineteenth century brought renown to authors known more for their literary criticism than for their own literary work, such as [[Matthew Arnold]].

=== The New Criticism ===
However important all of these aesthetic movements were as antecedents, current ideas about literary criticism derive almost entirely from the new direction taken in the early twentieth century. Early in the century the school of criticism known as [[Russian Formalism]], and slightly later the [[New Criticism]] in Britain and in the United States, came to dominate the study and discussion of literature, in the English-speaking world. Both schools emphasized the [[close reading]] of texts, elevating it far above generalizing discussion and speculation about either [[Authorial intentionality|authorial intention]] (to say nothing of the author's psychology or biography, which became almost taboo subjects) or [[reader response]]. This emphasis on form and precise attention to "the words themselves" has persisted, after the decline of these critical doctrines themselves.

=== Theory ===
In 1957 [[Northrop Frye]] published the influential ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]''. In his works Frye noted that some critics tend to embrace an [[ideology]], and to judge literary pieces on the basis of their adherence to such ideology. This has been a highly influential viewpoint among modern conservative thinkers. [[E. Michael Jones]], for example, argues in his ''Degenerate Moderns'' that [[Stanley Fish]] was influenced by his [[adultery|adulterous affairs]] to reject classic literature that condemned adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degenerate Moderns: Modernity as Rationalized Sexual Misbehaviour|last=Jones|first=E. Michael|date=1991|publisher=[[Ignatius Press]]|isbn=0898704472|location=San Francisco|oclc=28241358|pages=79–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Habermas]] in ''Erkenntnis und Interesse'' [1968] (''[[Knowledge and Human Interests]]''), described literary critical theory in literary studies as a form of [[hermeneutics]]: knowledge via interpretation to understand the meaning of human texts and symbolic expressions—including the interpretation of texts which themselves interpret other texts.

In the British and American literary establishment, the [[New Criticism]] was more or less dominant until the late 1960s. Around that time Anglo-American university literature departments began to witness a rise of a more explicitly philosophical [[literary theory]], influenced by [[structuralism]], then [[post-structuralism]], and other kinds of [[Continental philosophy]]. It continued until the mid-1980s, when interest in "theory" peaked. Many later critics, though undoubtedly still influenced by theoretical work, have been comfortable simply interpreting literature rather than writing explicitly about methodology and philosophical presumptions.

=== History of the book ===
Related to other forms of literary criticism, the [[history of the book]] is a field of interdisciplinary inquiry drawing on the methods of [[bibliography]], [[cultural history]], [[history of literature]], and [[media influence|media theory]]. Principally concerned with the production, circulation, and reception of texts and their material forms, book history seeks to connect forms of textuality with their material aspects.

Among the issues within the history of literature with which book history can be seen to intersect are: the development of authorship as a profession, the formation of reading audiences, the constraints of censorship and copyright, and the economics of literary form.

=== Current state ===
Today, interest in [[literary theory]] and [[continental philosophy]] coexists in university literature departments with a more conservative literary criticism of which the [[New Critics]] would probably have approved. Disagreements over the goals and methods of literary criticism, which characterized both sides taken by critics during the "rise" of theory, have declined. Many critics feel that they now have a great plurality of methods and approaches from which to choose.

Some critics work largely with theoretical texts, while others read traditional literature; interest in the literary [[Western canon|canon]] is still great, but many critics are also interested in minority and [[Women's writing in English|women's literatures]], while some critics influenced by [[cultural studies]] read popular texts like [[comic book]]s or [[Pulp magazine|pulp]]/[[genre fiction]]. [[Ecocriticism|Ecocritics]] have drawn connections between literature and the natural sciences. [[Darwinian literary studies]] studies literature in the context of [[evolutionary]] influences on human nature. Many literary critics also work in [[film criticism]] or [[media studies]]. Some write [[intellectual history]]; others bring the results and methods of [[social history]] to bear on reading literature.

==Value of academic criticism==
The value of extensive literary analysis has been questioned by several prominent artists. [[Vladimir Nabokov]] once wrote that good readers do not read books, and particularly those which are considered to be literary masterpieces, "for the academic purpose of indulging in generalizations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Nabokov]] ''Lectures on Literature'', chap. ''L'Envoi'' p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; At a 1986 [[Copenhagen]] conference of [[James Joyce]] scholars, [[Stephen J. Joyce]] (the modernist writer's grandson) said, "If my grandfather was here, he would have died laughing ... ''Dubliners'' and ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' can be picked up, read, and enjoyed by virtually anybody without scholarly guides, theories, and intricate explanations, as can ''Ulysses'', if you forget about all the hue and cry." He later questioned whether anything has been added to the legacy of Joyce's art by the 261 books of literary criticism stored in the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;D. T. Max (June 19, 2006).

[[File:Pietro_Perugino_cat55.jpg|thumb|''Madonna del Sacco'']]
'''''Madonna del Sacco''''' (literally ''Madonna of the Bag'') is an oil on panel painting by [[Perugino]], dating to around 1495-1500. It shows the Madonna and Child with the infant [[John the Baptist]] and an angel. It is now in the [[Palazzo Pitti|Galleria Palatina]] in [[Florence]].

The figure of Mary is stylistically close to that in the ''[[Madonna and Child (Perugino)|Madonna and Child]]'' and the ''[[Certosa di Pavia Altarpiece]]'', painted around the same time. She is modelled on Perugino's wife Chiara Fancelli.

'''''Murder in Space''''' is a 1985 [[science fiction]] [[Crime fiction|murder]] [[Whodunit|mystery]] [[television movie]] set in the near future. The crew of an international space mission are on the return leg from [[Mars]] to [[Earth]] when an explosion occurs on the craft ''Conestoga'', shortly after a series of murders starts. The crew of the returning craft are forbidden to return until the murderer is caught.

On its initial premier, the film was shown without the ending and a competition was set for the viewers to solve the mystery of who the murderer or murderers were. The conclusion of the film was shown several days later, with the contestants eliminated one by one until the winner correctly identified the killer or killers. The final 30 minutes of the film was shown at a later date when the mystery was solved.

'''''Of This Men Shall Know Nothing''''' (German: '''''Von diesem wissen Männer nichts''''') is oil on canvas painting by a German painter, sculptor, graphic artist, and poet [[Max Ernst]]. The painting was completed in 1923 in Paris, France. It is created in a [[Surrealism]] style by use of symbolic painting genre during First French period. The painting measure 81 by 64 centimeters and is now housed at Tate Gallery, London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk Tate Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The painting shares several features with Silberer’s diagram: its landscape setting and low horizon; the gradation of the sky from light at the bottom to dark at the top; and the inclusion of the Sun and the Moon. Ernst replaced the cube of Primal Matter with a pile of entrails.&lt;ref&gt;''Alchemy in contemporary art'' by Urszula Szulakowska, {{ISBN|0-7546-6736-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere Ernst also employed alchemical motifs, such as in this painting of the sexual conjunction of Sun and Moon.&lt;ref&gt;''Max Ernst and alchemy: a magician in search of a myth'', by M. E. Warlick, {{ISBN|0-2927-9136-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open music''' is [[music]] that is shareable, available in "[[source code]]" form, allows derivative works and is free of cost for non-commercial use. It is the concept of "[[open source software|open source]]" computer software applied to music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magnatune.com/info/openmusic Magnatune]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the non-commercial stipulation associated with Open Music is incompatible with the first section of the [[Open Source Software#The Open Source Definition|Open Source Definition]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opensource.org/osd.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the first freedom put forth in [[The Free Software Definition]] (freedom 0).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html&lt;/ref&gt; Open Music is one of the general responses to the [[RIAA]]'s and governmental actions against the music industry and its consumers.

"Open music" can be considered a subset of "[[free music]]" (referring to freedom). The differences of philosophy between advocates of "open source software" and  "[[free software]]" have not surfaced in the community of musicians contributing music to the [[copyleft]] commons. This may be due to the relatively recent emergence of copyleft music, as well as to the fact that software development generally involves much more collaboration and derivatization than does music production. It is not clear that open collaboration using copyleft licenses provides any significant advantages in music production, as open source advocates commonly argue is the case for software development.

Several websites have surfaced to provide musicians with the platform and tools necessary for online music collaboration.  Most of these sites promote one or more of the [[Creative Commons]] licenses, allowing derivative works and sharing of the finished songs.  Early implementations of these collaboration sites relied on threaded discussion forum software and FTP to provide a means for musicians to initiate and discuss projects, and to share multi-track files.  More recent and modern sites provide robust project-management features, automatic encoding and compression, online playback streaming, web-based upload and download options, chat, and project-based discussion forums.

There are plenty of artists that use Creative Commons Licenses. One the most open licence is "Creative Commons Attribution" License.

A '''puppet''' is an object, often resembling a human, animal or mythical figure, that is animated or manipulated by a person called a [[puppeteer]]. The puppeteer uses movements of their hands, arms, or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet. The puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet's mouth with this spoken part. The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppeteer with the puppet are typically used in [[storytelling]]. [[Puppetry]] is a very ancient form of [[theatre]] which dates back to the 5th century BC in [[Ancient Greece]]. There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made from a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They range from very simple in construction and operation to very complex.

Two simple types of puppets are the [[finger puppet]], which is a tiny puppet that fits onto a single finger, and the [[sock puppet]], which is formed and operated by inserting one's hand inside a sock, with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet's "mouth." The sock puppet is a type of [[hand puppet]], which is controlled using one hand that occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around. A "live-hand puppet" is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers for each puppet. A [[Marionette]] is a much more complicated type of puppet that is suspended and controlled by a number of strings connected to the head, back and limbs, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer.

A [[Rod puppet#Rod Puppets|rod puppet]] is constructed around a central rod secured to the head. A [[shadow puppet]] is a cut-out figure held between a source of light and a translucent screen. [[Bunraku|Bunraku puppets]] are a type of Japanese wood-carved puppet. A [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist's dummy]] is a human-shaped puppet operated by a [[ventriloquist]] performer's hand; the performer produces the puppets voice with little or no movement of her mouth, which creates the illusion that the puppet is alive. Carnival puppets are large puppets, typically bigger than a human, designed to be part of a large spectacle or [[parade]].

==Origins==
Puppetry was practiced in [[Ancient Greece]] and the oldest written records of puppetry can be found in the works of [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], dating from the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]], 2.48, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0016,001:2:48&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]], 4.55, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0032,004:4:55&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greek language|Greek]] word translated as "puppet" is "νευρόσπαστος" (''nevrospastos''), which literally means "drawn by strings, string-pulling",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneuro%2Fspastos νευρόσπαστος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from "νεῦρον" (''nevron''), meaning either "sinew, tendon, muscle, string", or "wire",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneu%3Dron νεῦρον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and "σπάω" (''spaō''), meaning "draw, pull".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dspa%2Fw σπάω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=neurospast&amp;lang=greek List of Ancient Greek words related to puppetry], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) discusses puppets in his work ''[[On the Motion of Animals]]''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The movements of animals may be compared with those of automatic puppets, which are set going on the occasion of a tiny movement; the levers are released, and strike the twisted strings against one another.&lt;ref http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/motion_animals.html&gt;Aristotle, On the Motion of Animals, 350 BC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In India, puppetry was practiced from ancient times and is known by different names in different parts of the country. Excavation of clay dolls from [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus valley]] sites serve as an indication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pulling the strings to resuscitate a dying art|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pulling-the-strings-to-resuscitate-a-dying-art/article3783718.ece|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=17 August 2012|location=Thanjavur, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art of puppetry called [[Dance forms of Tamil Nadu|Bommalattam]] is mentioned in Tamil literature [[Silappadikaram]], which is written around 2nd century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrtindia.gov.in/puppetforms.htm|title=Puppet Forms of India|author=|work=|publisher=Centre for Cultural Resources and Training, Ministry of Culture, Government of India|accessdate=24 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515224842/http://ccrtindia.gov.in/puppetforms.htm|archivedate=15 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Puppets and Puppetry==
Puppetry by its nature is a flexible and inventive medium and many puppet companies work with combinations of puppet forms and incorporate real objects into their performances. They might, for example, incorporate performing objects such as torn paper for [[snow]], or a sign board with words as narrative devices within a production. The following are, alphabetically, the basic and conventional forms of puppet:

===Black light puppet===
[[File:Lemon whole01 wiki.jpg|thumb|A black light puppet]]

The '''black light puppet''' is a form of puppetry where the puppets are operated on a stage lit only with [[ultraviolet lighting]], which hides the puppeteer and accentuates the colours of the puppets, which are normally designed using colours that respond to UV light by glowing brightly. The puppeteers perform dressed in black against a black background, with the background and puppeteer's costume normally made of black [[velvet]]. The puppeteers manipulate the puppets under the light, while they position themselves unseen against the black unlit background. Puppets of many sizes and types may be used. The original concept of this form of puppetry can be traced to [[Bunraku]] puppetry.

===Bunraku puppet===
'''[[Bunraku|Bunraku puppets]]''' are a type of wood-carved puppet originally made to stand out through [[torch]] illumination. Developed in [[Japan]] over a thousand years ago and formalised and combined with [[shamisen]] music at the end of the 16th century, the puppeteers dress to remain neutral against a black background, although their presence as a kind of 'shadow' figure adds a mysterious power to the puppet. Bunraku traditionally uses three puppeteers to operate a puppet that varies from 1/3 to 1/2 life size.&lt;ref&gt;Adachi, Barbara C., ''Backstage at Bunraku'', Weatherhill, 1985 . {{ISBN|0-8348-0199-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cantastoria===
'''Cantastoria''' is a form of visual [[storytelling]] in which a puppet, illustration, painting, or other visual medium is accompanied by rhythmical speech or song that describes or reenacts events to tell a story.

===Carnival or body puppet===
'''Carnival puppets''' (also known as '''body puppets''') are usually designed to be part of a large spectacle. These are often used in [[parades]] (such as the [[May Day|Mayday parade]] in [[Minneapolis]], United States and The Cape Town Carnival in South Africa) and demonstrations, and are at least the size of a human and often much larger. One or more performers are required to move the body and limbs. In parades, the appearance and personality of the person inside is not relevant to the spectator. These puppets are particularly associated with large-scale entertainment, such as the nightly parades at various [[Disney]] complexes around the world. Similar puppets were designed by [[Julie Taymor]] for ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]''.

[[The Jim Henson Company]] also has their version of these puppets called '''full-bodied puppets'''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Finger puppet===
The '''[[finger puppet]]''' is a simple puppet variant which fits onto a single finger. Finger puppets normally have no moving parts, and consist primarily of a hollow cylinder shape to cover the finger. Finger puppets are often decorated with eyes and mouths made out of fabric or other materials. This form of puppet has limited application, and is used mainly in pre-schools or kindergartens for storytelling with young children.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Hand puppet or glove puppet===
A '''[[hand puppet]]''' (or '''[[glove puppetry|glove puppet]]''') is a puppet controlled by one hand, which occupies the interior of the puppet. The [[Punch and Judy]] puppets are familiar examples of hand puppets. Larger varieties of hand puppets place the puppeteer's hand in just the puppet's head, controlling the mouth and head, and the puppet's body then hangs over the entire arm. Other parts of the puppet (mainly arms) are usually not much larger than the hand itself. Often the mouth can also open and close, and special variants exist with eyelids that can be manipulated. A [[sock puppet]] is a particularly simple type of hand puppet made from a sock.&lt;ref&gt;Currell, David, ''Introduction to Puppets and Puppet making'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Human-arm puppet===
Also called a "two-man puppet" or a "live-hand puppet", the human-arm puppet is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers. One puppeteer places their dominant hand inside the puppet's head and operates the puppet's head and mouth, while putting their non-dominant arm into a glove and special sleeve attached to the puppet. The second puppeteer puts their arm into a glove and special sleeve attached to the puppet in order to operate the other arm. This way, the puppet can perform hand gestures. This is a form of glove or hand puppetry and rod puppetry.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Light curtain puppet===
'''Light curtain puppet''' presentations use light to highlight small portions of a performance area, allowing the puppet to be seen while the manipulators remain invisible. The puppets stand on a stage divided into an unlit background and a well-lit foreground, meeting to form a "curtain" of light. The puppeteer dresses in black and remains hidden in the unlit background of the stage while the puppet is held across the light curtain in the lit foreground of the stage. "Light curtain puppet" is an umbrella term, and any puppet which is extended into a well-lit area where its handler remains separated from the puppet by a division of light may be called a light curtain puppet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Puppet show at PNCA mesmerises children of twin cities|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2011\07\05\story_5-7-2011_pg11_9|accessdate=|newspaper=Daily Times|date=5 July 2011|location=Islamabad, Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marionette===
'''[[Marionette]]s,''' or "string puppets," are suspended and controlled by a number of strings, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer. The control bar can be either horizontal or vertical. Basic strings for operation are usually attached to the head, back, hands (to control the arms) and just above the knee (to control the legs).&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Patricia and Stuart, ''Exploring Puppetry'', p.64&lt;/ref&gt; This form of puppetry is complex and sophisticated to operate, requiring greater manipulative control than a finger, glove or rod puppet. The puppet play performed by the Von Trapp children with Maria in ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' is a marionette show.

Famous Italian puppet is Romeo Gallo.

===Marotte===
The '''[[marotte]]''' is a simplified rod puppet that is just a head and/or body on a stick. It was used by jesters in renaissance times. In a ''marotte à main prenante'', the puppeteer's other arm emerges from the body (which is just a cloth drape) to act as the puppet's arm. Some marottes have a small string running through the stick attached to a handle at the bottom. When the handle is squeezed, the [[mouth]] opens.

===Motekar===
'''Motekar''' or wayang motekar is a kind of shadow puppet theater known in Sundanese, Javanese, and Indonesian as 'wayang (kulit)', that is, (leather) shadow puppet. While most shadow puppets cast black silhouettes from behind a screen, motekar shadow puppets can be in full color. They use plastic materials, transparent dyes, a special light system, and a special type of screen to make this happen.
Motekar puppet shows can be performed by one or several puppeteers and usually feature music, singing, and a series of dances.

===Object puppet===
[[File:Object Puppet from EXORCISM, Nikolai Zykov Theatre, Russia.JPG|thumb|Object Puppet of [[Nikolai Zykov]] Theatre, Russia.]]
Not all forms of puppetry need specially created items to puppet. '''Object puppets''' can be created with found everyday objects either assembled in advance or during performance. [[Señor Wences]] was a Spanish ventriloquist who became popular through his appearances on the American program ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. His characters included Johnny (a face drawn on his hand) and Pedro (a gruff head in a box) who would talk when Wences opened the box. Similarly, [[chinface puppet]]ry involves puppet features drawn or attached onto an upside-down chin.

===Pull string puppet===
A '''pull string puppet''' is a puppet consisting of a cloth body where in the puppeteer puts his/her arm into a slot in the back and pulls rings on strings to make certain movements such as waving the arms or moving the mouth.

===Push puppet===
A '''push puppet''' consists of a segmented character on a base which is kept under tension until the button on the bottom is pressed. The puppet wiggles, slumps and then collapses. Push puppets are usually intended as novelty [[toys]], rather than as part of professional puppet theatre.

===Rod puppet===
A '''[[rod puppet]]''' is a puppet constructed around a central rod secured to the head. A large glove covers the rod and is attached to the neck of the puppet. A rod puppet is controlled by the puppeteer moving the metal rods attached to the hands of the puppet (or any other limbs) and by turning the central rod secured to the head.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Shadow puppet===
A '''[[shadow puppet]]''' is a cut-out figure held between a source of light and a translucent screen. Shadow puppets can form solid silhouettes or be decorated with various amounts of cut-out details. Colour can be introduced into the cut-out shapes to provide a different dimension and different effects can be achieved by moving the puppet (or light source) out of focus. [[Java]]nese shadow puppets known as [[Wayang Kulit]] are the classic example of this.&lt;ref&gt;Currell, David, ''An Introduction to Puppets and Puppetmaking', p.7&lt;/ref&gt; In China, it became popular from [[Song Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gbtimes.com/culture/arts/shadow-puppetry-brightens-those-dark-days|title=Shadow puppetry brightens those dark days|author=Tytti Ollila |date=2 April 2012|work= |publisher=GB-Times|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sock puppet===
[[File:Squeak, a sock puppet from Totally Socks.png|thumb|Sock puppet from the Web series ''Totally Socks'']]

A '''[[sock puppet]]''' is a puppet formed and operated by inserting a hand inside a sock. The hand is opened and closed to simulate the movement of the puppet's "mouth" and give the impression of speaking. Sometimes eyes and other facial features are added to the sock in order to make the puppet more realistic. Sock puppets are popular in many puppet performances, as they are simple to make and easy to use. They are mostly used in satirical or children's works.

===Supermarionation===
'''[[Supermarionation]]''' is a method of puppetry invented by [[Gerry Anderson]], which he used in his television shows ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]'' and ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''. The puppets were marionettes with electronically moving mouths to allow for [[Lip-syncing|lip-synchronised speech]]. The marionettes were still controlled by human manipulators with darkened strings.

===Table top puppet===
A '''table top puppet''' is a puppet usually operated by rod or direct contact from behind, on a surface similar to a table top (hence the name). Shares many characteristics with Bunraku.

===Ticklebug===
A '''Ticklebug''' is a type of hand puppet created from a human hand to have four legs, where the puppet features are drawn on the hand itself. The middle finger is lifted as a head, and the thumb and forefinger serve as a first set of two legs on one side, while the ring finger and little finger serve as a second set of two legs on the opposite side.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Toy theatre===
The '''[[Toy theater|toy theatre]]''' is a puppet cut out of paper and stuck onto card. It is fixed at its base to a stick and operated by pushing it in from the side of the puppet theatre. Sheets of puppets and scenery were produced from the 19th century for children's use.

===Ventriloquism dummy===
The '''[[Ventriloquism|Ventriloquist's Dummy]]''' is a puppet shaped like a small human which is operated by a ventriloquist performer to focus the audience's attention away from the performer's activities and heighten the illusion that the dummy is speaking. They are called dummies because they do not speak on their own. The ventriloquist dummy is controlled by one hand of the ventriloquist. Ventriloquism acts are not always performed with a traditional dummy; occasionally other forms of puppetry are used.

===Water puppet===
[[File:Puppettheatre.JPG|thumb|Vietnamese water puppets]]
A '''[[Water puppetry|water puppet]]''' is a [[Vietnam]]ese puppet form, the "Múa rối nước". Múa rối nước literally translates to "dance underwater" or "dancing underwater". This is an ancient tradition that dates back to the 10th century. The puppets are built out of wood and the shows are performed in a waist-deep pool. A large rod supports the puppet under the water and is used by the puppeteers to control them. The appearance is of the puppets moving over the water. When the rice fields would flood, the villagers would entertain each other using this puppet form.

The water also provides the setting for traditional stories depicting day-to-day village life. Water puppets bring wry humor to scenes of farming, fishing, festival events such as buffalo fights, and children's games of marbles and coin-toss. Fishing turns into a game of wits between the fisherman and his prey, with the fisherman getting the short end (often capturing his surprised neighbor by mistake). Besides village life, scenes include legends and national history. Lion dogs romp like puppies while dragons exhale fire and smoke and shoot sprays of water at the audience. Performances of up to 18 short scenes are usually introduced by a pig-tailed bumpkin known as Teu, and accompanied by a small folk orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagecraft.com/puppetry/traditions/Vietnamese.html|title=Vietnamese Water Puppets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Idioms and cultural expressions==
{{see also|Puppet (disambiguation)}}
The word ''puppet'' can mean a political leader installed, supported and controlled by powerful external forces, without legitimacy in the country itself. In modern times, this usually implies no [[democracy|democratic]] mandate from the country's electorate; in earlier times, it could have meant a monarch imposed from outside, who was not a member of a country's established ruling dynasty, or unrecognised by its nobility. "Puppet government", "puppet regime" and "[[puppet state]]" are derogatory terms for a [[government]] which is in charge of a region or country, but only through being installed, supported and controlled by a more powerful outside government. An example is [[Vidkun Quisling]], a Norwegian fascist leader during World War Two who collaborated with the Nazis and led a puppet government.

In a more general sense, a puppet is any person who is controlled by another by reasons of (for instance) undue influence, intellectual deficiency, or lack of character or charisma. Science fiction writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novel ''[[The Puppet Masters]]'' depicts [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[parasites]] who attach themselves to human beings and control their actions.

[[Poppet]], a word that sounds similar, is sometimes a term of endearment, similar to "love", "pet", "doll" or "dear". It alludes to folk-[[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[witchcraft]], where a poppet is a special doll created to represent a person for the purpose of casting healing, fertility, or binding [[Magic (paranormal)|spells]].

[[Sock Puppet]] is used on social media as a term to describe fake accounts used to spread political disinformation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2824">The '''RIAI Travelling Scholarship''' is an award made annually by the [[Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland]] to one or more students of architecture attending a school of architecture in the [[Republic of Ireland]] or [[Northern Ireland]].

The award has been made annually since 1935 and has former the basis for the careers of many notable Irish architects, among them [[Arthur Gibney]], [[Sam Stephenson]] and [[Trevor Leaker]].

Over the course of its history, the scholarship has been competed for in numerous ways. Current practice is for the RIAI to set a competition brief, which is then the subject of the design of a building or landscape by the competitors. An appointed jury of distinguished and learned architects and pedagogues then selects the winning entry.

'''''[[Holidays in the Danger Zone]]: Rivers''''' is a five-part travel documentary on dangerous [[rivers]], part of the ''[[Holidays in the Danger Zone]]'' series, produced and broadcast by [[BBC]] [[This World (television programme)|This World]]. Written and presented by [[Ben Anderson (journalist)|Ben Anderson]], and produced by Will Daws.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shootandscribble.com/sr/page6/page7/page7.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was first broadcast between 21 February - 7 March  2006, on [[BBC Two]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/this_world/4714064.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

*Episode 1: [[Amazon River|Amazon]]
*Episode 2: [[Ganges]]
*Episode 3: [[Euphrates]]
*Episode 4: [[The Jordan]]
*Episode 5: [[Congo River|Congo]]

In the series, Anderson journeys down some of the world's most dangerous rivers, exploring life and the daily struggle to exist beside rivers that have been the course of so much political unrest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electricsky.com/catalogue_detail.aspx?program=13&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the Amazon, Anderson journey takes him into the Andes, where the effects of altitude sickness at the source of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] take its toll on him.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/this_world/4714064.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Then in India, Anderson visits the rapidly melting Satopanth Glaicer that feeds the Ganges, its possibly impacted with [[Pakistan]] over control over water rights, before visiting the [[Varanasi|holy city of Varanasi]] where the massive amount of burials and cremations has caused the Ganges to become highly polluted; it is the fifth most polluted river of the world as of 2007,&lt;ref&gt;kalpana 1 April 2007 (1 April 2007)   "Ganga is dying, pollution the killer". Greendiary.com. Retrieved 4 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and a modern health hazard to everything that depends on the river for life. Anderson then to the Euphrates &amp; The Jordan, both ancient rivers, steeped in history of a troubled region, before ending on the Congo, which like the nation it cuts though has seen much violence in recent years.

The '''Salle de la Bouteille'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=90YqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9 La Salle 1875, pp. 9–20].&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Salle du Jeu de Paume de la Bouteille''', later known as the '''Hôtel [de] Guénégaud''' or '''Guénégaud Theatre''',&lt;ref&gt;Clarke 1998, pp. 13–14. Clarke refers to the theatre as the Hôtel Guénégaud, with the particule "de" omitted, and states this form is particularly prevalent in the more recent literature; Forman 2010, p. 127, uses the name Théâtre de Guénégaud; Wiley 1960, p. 320, indexes it under "Guénégaud, Hôtel (Théâtre) de"; [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA33 Lecomte 1905, p. 33], uses "Hôtel Guénégaud (théâtre de l')".&lt;/ref&gt; was a 1671 [[Theater (structure)|theatre]] located in Paris, France, between the [[rue de Seine]] and the rue des Fossés de Nesle across from the rue Guénégaud&lt;ref&gt;[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k57456450/f184.image Chappuzeau 1674 (1875), pp. 156–157]; translated by Howarth 1997, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; (now 42 rue Mazarine, at its intersection with the rue Jacques Callot). It was the first home of the [[Paris Opera]] and in 1680 became the first theatre of the [[Comédie-Française]].

==History==
A former tennis court (''[[jeu de paume]]'') converted into a theatre, it was inaugurated in 1671 as the first home of [[Pierre Perrin]]'s Académie d'Opéra (see [[Paris Opera]]). The first French opera, [[Robert Cambert]]'s ''[[Pomone (opera)|Pomone]]'' with a libretto by Perrin, premiered there on 3 March of that year.&lt;ref name="Sadler"&gt;Sadler 2001, p.180. Bashford 1992, p. 697: "Considered by modern scholars to be the first true French opera..."&lt;/ref&gt; A second lyric work, ''Les peines et les plaisirs de l'amour'', with a libretto by [[Gabriel Gilbert]] and music by Cambert, was performed in 1672.&lt;ref name=Harris856&gt;Harris-Warrick 1992, p. 856.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 13 March 1672 the ''surintendant'' of the king's music, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], acquired Perrin's rights to perform opera and named his company the Académie Royale de Musique, although it also continued to be called the Opéra. Because of legal difficulties Lully could not use the Salle de la Bouteille, and moved the Opéra to a theatre built by [[Carlo Vigarani]] in the [[Bel-Air tennis court]] on the [[Rue de Vaugirard]].&lt;ref name=Harris856 /&gt;

In 1673, after the death of [[Molière]], the Salle de la Bouteille became the home of the Guénégaud Theatre, a company formed from the remnants of the [[troupe of Molière]] and players from the [[Théâtre du Marais]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke 1998, pp. 36–45; Forman 2010, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1680, after merging with the troupe from the [[Hôtel de Bourgogne (theatre)|Hôtel de Bourgogne]], the company became known as the [[Comédie-Française]] and continued to perform in the Guénégaud until 1689, when it moved to the Jeu de Paume de l'Étoile on the rue des Fossés-Saint-Germain-des-Prés (the southeastward extension of the rue des Fossés de Nesle, today known as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Rue de l'Ancienne-Comédie|fr|lt=rue de l'Ancienne-Comédie|vertical-align=sup}}).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 Lecomte 1905, p. 20].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke 1998, pp. 1, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Seven Sorrows [[Polyptych]]''''' is an [[oil painting|oil on panel]] painting by [[Albrecht Dürer]]. The painting includes a central picture (108 x 43&amp;nbsp;cm), currently at the [[Alte Pinakothek]] in [[Munich]], and seven surrounding panels (measuring some 60 x 46&amp;nbsp;cm) which are exhibited at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] of [[Dresden]].

==Description==
The work was commissioned by [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], not a long time after his meeting with Dürer at [[Nuremberg]] in April 1496. Stylistic considerations suggest that the artist started to work on the painting only from around 1500.

Modern scholars tend to attribute to  Dürer only the central panel, the others having been executed by his pupils based on his drawings. The central panel, portraying the ''Sorrowing Mother'', arrived in the Bavarian museum from the  '' Benediktbeuren'' convent of [[Munich]] in the early 19th century. It was restored in the 1930s: once the overpaintings and additions were removed, the shell-shaped niche (a motif typical of Italian art), the halo and the sword (a symbol of Mary of the Seven Sorrows) on the right were rediscovered, clarifying the subject of the work.

The other panels were at [[Wittenberg]], seat of Frederick's castle. In 1640 they were moved to the  Kunstkammer of the Prince of Saxony. In the mid-20th century they were restored: their conditions improved, but the attribution was not cleared.

'''State Research and Design Shipbuilding Center''' ({{lang-uk|Державне підприємство «Дослідно-проектний центр кораблебудування» (ДП «ДПЦК»)}}) is a [[design bureau]] specializing in shipbuilding and located in [[Mykolaiv]], [[Ukraine]]. It is part of the [[Ukrainian Defense Industry (company)|Ukrainian Defense Industries]] state corporation.

==History==
Established in 1975 as a regional division of the [[:ru:Северное проектно-конструкторское бюро|Northern Planning and Design Bureau]] (Severnoe PDB, [[Leningrad]]) known as the 61st department. 

During [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1990 it was transformed into the Southern Planning and Design Burea (Yuzhnoe PDB, [[Mykolaiv]]).

After the [[Succession of states|succession]] of Ukraine from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1992, the company became a major state [[design bureau]], the State Research and Design Shipbuilding Center located in a [[seaport]] of Ukraine, [[Mykolaiv]] next to several [[shipyard]]s.

'''Stuckism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ʌ|k|ɪ|z|əm}}) is an international [[art movement]] founded in 1999 by [[Billy Childish]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] to promote [[Figurative art|figurative painting]] as opposed to [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/s/stuckism "Glossary: Stuckism"], ''[[Tate]]''. Retrieved 16 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/stuckists/ "The Stuckists Punk Victorian"], [[Walker Art Gallery]], [[National Museums Liverpool]]. Retrieved 15 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2017 the initial group of 13 British artists had expanded to 236 groups in 52 countries.&lt;ref name=stuckismwebsite&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/ "Stuckism International"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 22 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Childish and Thomson have issued several manifestos. The first one was ''The Stuckists'', consisting of 20 points starting with "Stuckism is a quest for [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]".&lt;ref name=stuckistmanifest&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/stuckistmanifesto.html The Stuckists manifesto], stuckism.com. Retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Remodernism]]'', the other well-known manifesto of the movement, is a [[criticism of postmodernism]]; it aims to get back to the true spirit of [[modernism]], to produce art with spiritual value regardless of style, subject matter or medium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://painting.about.com/od/artglossaryr/g/defremodernism.htm Art Glossary: Remodernism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420012721/http://painting.about.com/od/artglossaryr/g/defremodernism.htm |date=20 April 2012 }}, about.com.

Retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

After exhibiting in small galleries in [[Shoreditch]], London, the Stuckists' first show in a major public museum was held in 2004 at the [[Walker Art Gallery]], as part of the [[Liverpool Biennial]]. The group has demonstrated annually at [[Tate Britain]] against the [[Turner Prize]] since 2000, sometimes dressed in clown costumes. They have also come out in opposition to the [[Charles Saatchi]]-patronised [[Young British Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/movements/stuckism Stuckism], Artist Biographies website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/turner-prize/8834871/The-Turner-Prizes-most-controversial-moments.html The Turner Prize's most controversial moments], 20 October 2011, The Telegraph website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although painting is the dominant artistic form of Stuckism, artists using other media such as photography, sculpture, film and [[collage]] have also joined, and share the Stuckist opposition to conceptualism and "ego-art."&lt;ref name=robertjanas&gt;"Stuckism International: The Stuckist Decade 1999–2009", [[Robert Janás]], [http://www.victoriapress.co.uk/ Victoria Press], 2009, a: p.73 - b: p.64, {{ISBN|0-907165-28-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name, founding and origin==

The name "Stuckism" was coined in January 1999 by [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] in response to a poem read to him several times by [[Billy Childish]]. In it, Childish recites that his former girlfriend, [[Tracey Emin]] had said he was "stuck! stuck! stuck!" with his art, poetry and music.&lt;ref name=milner7&gt;[[Charles Thomson (artist)|Thomson, Charles]] (August 2004), "A Stuckist on Stuckism: Stella Vine", from: Ed. Frank Milner (2004), ''The Stuckists Punk Victorian'', pp. 7–9, [[National Museums Liverpool]], {{ISBN|1-902700-27-9}}. Available online at [http://www.stuckism.com/Walker/AStuckistOnStuckism.html#TwoStarts "The Two Starts of Stuckism"] and [http://www.stuckism.com/Walker/AStuckistOnStuckism.html#Virtual "The Virtual Stuckists"] on stuckism.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Thomson approached Childish with a view to co-founding an art group called Stuckism, which Childish agreed to, on the basis that Thomson would do the work for the group, as Childish already had a full schedule.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt;

There were eleven other founding members: [[Philip Absolon]], Frances Castle, Sheila Clark, [[Eamon Everall]], [[Ella Guru]], [[Wolf Howard]], [[Bill Lewis]], Sanchia Lewis, [[Joe Machine]], [[Sexton Ming]], and [[Charles Williams (artist)|Charles Williams]].&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; The membership has evolved since its founding through creative collaborations:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/info.html "Stuckism: Introduction"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 18 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the group was originally promoted as working in paint, but members have since worked in various other media, including poetry, fiction, performance, photography, film and music.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt;

In 1979, Thomson, Childish, Bill Lewis and Ming were members of [[The Medway Poets]] performance group, to which Absolon and Sanchia Lewis had earlier contributed.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; Peter Waite's Rochester Pottery staged a series of solo painting shows.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; In 1982, [[Television South|TVS]] broadcast a documentary on the poets.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; That year, Emin, then a fashion student, and Childish started a relationship; her writing was edited by Bill Lewis, printed by Thomson and published by Childish.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; Group members published dozens of works.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; The poetry group dispersed after two years, reconvening in 1987 to record ''The Medway Poets'' LP.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; Clark, Howard and Machine became involved over the following years.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; Thomson got to know Williams, who was a local art student and whose girlfriend was a friend of Emin; Thomson also met Everall.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt; During the foundation of the group, Ming brought in his girlfriend, Guru, who in turn invited Castle.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt;

==Manifestos==
[[Image:2000 Real Turner Prize Show.jpg|thumb|left|The first Stuckists group of 13 artists at the ''Real Turner Prize Show'', Pure Gallery, Shoreditch, London, in October 2000]]

In August 1999, Childish and Thomson wrote ''The Stuckists [[manifesto]]''&lt;ref name=stuckistmanifest/&gt; which stress the value of painting as a medium, its use for communication, and the expression of emotion and experience – as opposed to what Stuckists see as the superficial novelty, nihilism and irony of conceptual art and [[postmodernism]]. The most contentious statement in the manifesto is: "Artists who don't paint aren't artists".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/stuckists-scourge-of-britart-put-on-their-own-exhibition-413009.html Stuckists, scourge of BritArt, put on their own exhibition] Sarah Cassidy, ''[[The Independent]]'', 23 August 2006,&lt;/ref&gt;

The second and third manifestos, ''An Open Letter to Sir Nicholas Serota'' and ''[[Remodernism]]'' respectively, were sent to the director of the [[Tate]], [[Nicholas Serota]]. He sent a brief reply: "Thank you for your open letter dated 6&amp;nbsp;March. You will not be surprised to learn that I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto 'Remodernism'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/serotareply.html "An open letter to Sir Nicholas Serota"], stuckism.com, 1999. Retrieved 20 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Remodernism'' manifesto, the Stuckists declared that they aimed to replace postmodernism with remodernism, a period of renewed spiritual (as opposed to religious) values in art, culture and society. Other manifestos have included ''Handy Hints'', ''Anti-anti-art'', ''The Cappuccino writer and the Idiocy of Contemporary Writing'', ''The Turner Prize'', ''The Decreptitude of the Critic'' and ''Stuckist critique of Damien Hirst''.

In ''Anti-anti-art'', the Stuckists outlined their opposition to what is known as "[[anti-art]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuckism.com/StuckistAntiAntiArt.html |title=Anti-Anti-Art |publisher=Stuckism.com |date=2000-11-04 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stuckists claim that [[conceptual art]] is justified by the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]], but that Duchamp's work is "anti-art by intent and effect". The Stuckists feel that "Duchamp's work was a protest against the stale, unthinking artistic establishment of his day", while "the great (but wholly unintentional) irony of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]] is that it is a direct equivalent of the conformist, unoriginal establishment that Duchamp attacked in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/art2/asullivan/stuckism.html |title=Stuckism : Art Against Art Against Art |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manifestos have been written by other Stuckists, including the Students for Stuckism group. An "Underage Stuckists" group was founded in 2006 with a manifesto for teenagers written by two 16-year-olds, Liv Soul and Rebekah Maybury, on [[MySpace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Manifestos/UnderageStuckists.html "The Underage Stuckists Manifesto"], stuckism.com.

In July 1999, the Stuckists were first mentioned in the media, in an article in ''The Evening Standard'' and soon gained other coverage, helped by press interest in Tracey Emin, who had been nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/news99.html Stuckism news 1999], stuckism.com.

The first Stuckist show was ''Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!'' in September 1999 in Joe Crompton's in [[Shoreditch]] Gallery 108 (now defunct), followed by  ''The Resignation of Sir Nicholas Serota''. In 2000 they staged ''The Real Turner Prize Show'' at the same time as the [[Tate Gallery]]'s Turner Prize exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-891549-turner-prize-a-load-of-rubbish.do Turner Prize: a load of rubbish?], ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 24 October 2000.

A "Students for Stuckism" group was founded in 2000 by students from [[Camberwell College of Arts]], who staged their own exhibition. [[Stephen Howarth|S.P. Howarth]] was expelled from the painting degree course at Camberwell college for his paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Alberge, Dalya, "Students accuse art college of failing to teach them the basics", ''[[The Times]]'', p. 9, 8 July 2002.

Thomson stood as a Stuckist candidate for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 British General Election]], in the constituency of [[Islington South and Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Islington South &amp; Finsbury]], against [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]], the then [[Secretary of State for Culture]].

From 2002 to 2005 Thomson ran the [[Stuckism International Gallery|Stuckism International Centre and Gallery]] in Shoreditch, London. In 2003, under the title ''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', the gallery exhibited a shark which had first been put on public display in 1989 (two years before [[Damien Hirst]]'s) by Eddie Saunders in his Shoreditch shop, JD Electrical Supplies. It was suggested that Hirst may have seen this and copied it.&lt;ref name=deadshark&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/SharkSpot.html "A Dead Shark Isn't Art"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 20 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 they reported [[Charles Saatchi]] to the UK [[Office of Fair Trading]], complaining that he had an effective monopoly on art. The complaint was not upheld.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Saatchi/SaatchiOFT.html "Charles Saatchi reported to OFT"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 27 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, an allied group, [[Stuckism Photography]], was founded by Larry Dunstan and Andy Bullock. In 2005 the Stuckists offered a donation of 175 paintings from the Walker show to the Tate, but it was rejected by the Tate's trustees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/11/arts.artsnews1 How ageing art punks got stuck into Tate's Serota], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 11 December 2005.

In August 2005 Thomson alerted the press to the fact that the Tate had purchased a work by [[Chris Ofili]], ''The Upper Room'', for £705,000 while the artist was a serving Tate trustee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/11/arts.artsnews1 How ageing art punks got stuck into Tate's Serota], The Guardian, 11 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/Ofili.html "Tate buys trustee Chris Ofili's The Upper Room in secret £705,000 deal"], stuckism.com.

An international symposium on Stuckism took place in October 2006 at the [[Liverpool John Moores University]] during the Liverpool Biennial. The programme was led by [[Naive John]], founder of the Liverpool Stuckists. There was an accompanying exhibition in the 68&amp;nbsp;Hope Gallery at [[Liverpool School of Art and Design]] (John Moores University Gallery).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentsbiennial.org/?p=99 Day 13th Oct "International Symposium on Stuckism"], Independents Liverpool Biennial.

==Responses &amp; Critique==
In 1999, two performance artists, [[Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi]], jumped on Tracey Emin's installation ''My Bed'', a work consisting of the artist's own unmade bed, at the Tate Gallery's Turner Prize, in an unauthorised [[art intervention]]. Chai had written, among other things, the words "Anti Stuckism" on his bare back. Fiachra Gibbons of ''The Guardian'' wrote (in 1999) that the event "will go down in art history as the defining moment of the new and previously unheard of Anti-Stuckist Movement."&lt;ref name=satirists&gt;Gibbons, Fiachra (1999)[https://www.theguardian.com/turner1999/Story/0,12119,201733,00.html "Satirists Jump into Tracey's Bed"]''[[The Guardian]]'' online, 25 October 1999. Retrieved 22 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''The Guardian'' ten years later, Jonathan Jones described the Stuckists as "enemies of art", and what they say as "cheap slogans" and "hysterical rants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Jonathan |title=The Stuckists are enemies of art |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/oct/01/art-stuckist-manifesto |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=16 March 2015|date=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist Max Podstolski wrote that the art world needed a new manifesto, as confrontational as that of [[Futurism]] or [[Dadaism]], "written with a heart-felt passion capable of inspiring and rallying art world outsiders, dissenters, rebels, the neglected and disaffected", and suggests that "Well now we've got it, in the form of Stuckism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Podstolski |first1=Max |title=Head vs. Heart: a Critique of the Stuckist Manifesto |url=http://www.spark-online.com/issue32/podstolski.html |journal=Spark-online |issue=32.0 |accessdate=16 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328082935/http://www.spark-online.com/issue32/podstolski.html |archivedate=28 March 2013 |date=May 2002 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York art gallery owner Edward Winkleman wrote in 2006 that he had never heard of the Stuckists, so he "looked them up on Wikipedia", and stated he was "turned off by their anti-conceptual stance, not to mention the inanity of their statement about painting, but I'm more than a bit interested in the democratization their movement represents." Thomson responded to Winkleman directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Winkleman |first1=Edward |title=The Stuckists |url=http://www.edwardwinkleman.com/2006/08/stuckists.html |accessdate=16 March 2015 |date=28 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Winkleman is notable in this context, read above for why--&gt;

Also in 2006, Colin Gleadell, writing in ''[[Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', noted that the Stuckist's first exhibition in central London had brought "multiple sales" for leading artists of the movement, and that this raised the question of how good they were at painting. He observed that "Whatever the critics may say, buyers from the UK, the US and Japan have already taken a punt. Six of Thomson's paintings have sold for between £4,000 and £5,000 each. Joe Machine, a former [[jailbird]] who paints for therapeutic reasons, has also sold six paintings for the same price."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gleadell|first1=Colin|title=Market news: Roger Hilton's child-like drawings, 'stuckist' paintings and Edward Seago|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3655699/Market-news-Roger-Hiltons-child-like-drawings-stuckist-paintings-and-Edward-Seago.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC arts correspondent Lawrence Pollard wrote in 2009 that the way was paved for "cultural agitators" like the Stuckists, as well as the [[Vorticism|Vorticists]], [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] and others, by the Futurist Manifesto of 20 February 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Back to the Futurists |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7894877.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 March 2015 |date=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Women''''' is a 2008 American [[comedy-drama]] film written, produced and directed by [[Diane English]]. The screenplay is an updated version of the [[George Cukor]]-directed [[The Women (1939 film)|1939 film of the same name]] based on a [[The Women (play)|1936 play]] by [[Clare Boothe Luce]].

In the original film, most of the characters were Manhattan socialites whose primary interest was idle gossip. In the 2008 version, several work in the fields of fashion design and publishing, and the character of Alex Fisher is openly a lesbian. A feature of the film, shared with the 1939 version, is that the movie does not show a single male actor or extra, with the exception of the baby at the very end of the film.

Though a commercial success, ''The Women'' was panned by critics.

==Plot==
Clothing designer Mary Haines lives in a beautiful suburban Connecticut home with her wealthy financier husband Steven and their 11-year-old daughter Molly. Her best friend since college, Sylvie Fowler, is the editor of a prominent fashion magazine that dictates the latest in taste and style for New York City fashionistas. When Sylvie learns Steven is involved with Crystal Allen, a perfume salesgirl in Saks Fifth Avenue, from chatty manicurist Tanya, she confides in the ever-pregnant Edie Cohen but hesitates to tell Mary, who discovers the news from the same woman after getting a manicure herself. Despite her mother Catherine's exhortation to keep quiet about what she knows, Mary confronts Sylvie first, in a lingerie store, and then Steven, before asking for a divorce.

Sylvie, Edie, and writer Alex Fisher join forces to support their spurned friend, but complications arise when Sylvie, facing the loss of her job, conspires with local gossip columnist Bailey Smith by confirming Mary's marital woes in exchange for Bailey contributing a celebrity profile to the magazine. Mary is stunned by Sylvie’s betrayal and ends their friendship. Mary's daughter begins to ditch school and confides in Sylvie because her mother, distracted by the upheavals in her once idyllic life, becomes more distant.

Mary is fired from her job by her father, has a makeover, and decides to open her own clothing design firm with some financial assistance from Catherine. As she begins to get her life in order, she makes an effort to bond with Molly, who reveals her father's relationship with Crystal is unraveling, and reunites with Sylvie, who has quit her job. With this knowledge in hand, Mary sets out to repair her fractured marriage as she prepares to unveil her new line of womenswear in a fashion show attended not only by boutique owners but the buyer from Saks as well.

Sylvie tells Mary that she has met a guy and is thinking of giving him her real phone number. Edie's water breaks and she has a baby boy. Mary receives a call from her husband and is encouraged by the others to answer it; she then arranges a date with him. In the end, we see that a magazine titled ''Sylvie'' is published with the four friends on the cover and Alex's book is out. A hint is given about Crystal’s possibly going out with Alex's ex-girlfriend Natasha. The women talk about the magazine, the book and the joys, heartaches and uniquely special triumphs of being a woman.

==Production==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2010}}
In ''The Women: The Legacy'', a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, Diane English discusses her fifteen-year-long struggle to bring a contemporary version of the 1939 classic film to the screen. She wanted to present a version in which the female characters were strong and self-reliant and supported and defended each other rather than resort to treachery and catty remarks to achieve their goals. Since the concept of women going to Reno in search of a divorce is archaic, she needed to eliminate this aspect of the original plot from her treatment, which necessitated deleting several characters from the story. One character that is not in its original form is Lucy, who in the play and original movie was the maid in Reno, here she is seen as Mary's dog.

English wrote the first screenplay in 1993 during hiatus from ''[[Murphy Brown]]''. The following year, [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Meg Ryan]] agreed to co-produce and star, with [[James L. Brooks]] as director and a supporting cast including [[Blythe Danner]], [[Marisa Tomei]], [[Debi Mazar]], and [[Candice Bergen]]. In 1996, the first table reading of the script was held at Sony Pictures. Despite the enthusiasm of everyone involved, the project stalled when Roberts and Ryan decided they wanted to play the same role.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

English spent the following year revising the screenplay, during which time Brooks dropped out to direct ''[[As Good as It Gets]]''. Roberts also lost interest and moved on. English first entertained the idea of directing the film herself in 2001. Over the next few years, [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Uma Thurman]], [[Whitney Houston]], and [[Queen Latifah]] were among those to express interest, although none were attached officially.

After being turned down by every major Hollywood studio, English decided to develop the project as an independent film and approached Victoria Pearman, the president of Mick Jagger's production company, Jagged Films, who agreed to produce the film for [[Picturehouse (company)|Picturehouse]]. Pearman offered some plot suggestions, and English put the finishing touches on the seventh and final draft of the script. Upon the film's completion, it was shown to executives at Warner Bros., which had absorbed Picturehouse in the interim. Unimpressed, they put the film on the back burner until the box office success of ''[[Sex and the City (film)|Sex and the City]]'' convinced them there was an audience for an all-female film.&lt;ref&gt;''Entertainment Weekly'', September 5, 2008, pp. 46–49&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was shot on location in New York City and various cities in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;http://hookedonhouses.net/2010/04/25/for-sale-the-colonial-revival-house-used-in-the-women/&lt;/ref&gt; As with the play and 1939 film, English was careful to make sure no men appear on screen, even in long shots and crowd scenes. The only male character in the film is Edie's baby boy, born in the final scene of the film, and a waiter at a café.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Film review: The Women|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/timrobey/3560325/Film-review-The-Women.html|author=Sukhdev Sandhu|accessdate=May 8, 2009|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=December 12, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The film received a significant negative response from critics. It holds a 13% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 3.9/10 and a critical consensus that states "''The Women'' is a toothless remake of the 1939 classic, lacking the charm, wit and compelling protagonists of the original."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10009516_women? |title=The Women (2008)- Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' was one of the few critics who enjoyed the film. He awarded it three out of four stars and commented,
{{blockquote|What a pleasure this movie is, showcasing actresses I've admired for a long time, all at the top of their form... Diane English focuses on story and character, and even in a movie that sometimes plays like an infomercial for Saks Fifth Avenue, we find ourselves intrigued by these women. ''The Women'' isn't a great movie, but how could it be? Too many characters and too much melodrama for that, and the comedy has to be somewhat muted to make the characters semi-believable. But as a well-crafted, well-written and well-acted entertainment, it drew me in and got its job done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080911/REVIEWS/809119989/1023 |title=''Chicago Sun-Times'', September 11, 2008 |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "a witless, straining mess" and added,
{{blockquote|You wait in vain for a moment of snappy repartee, of fresh emotion, of grace or charm or pathos...If ''The Women'' had managed to give its various impulses some kind of coherent shape or tone, it might be worth arguing about. As it is, the movie wanders and wallows, stumbling toward [[screwball comedy|screwball]] before veering in the direction of weepiness and grasping at satirical urbanity along the way...Rarely has class struggle, or catfighting, for that matter, been so tediously waged. And rarely have so many fine actresses been enlisted in such a futile cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=A. O. Scott |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/movies/12wome.html?ref=arts&amp;em |title=''New York Times'', September 12, 2008 |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=2008-09-12 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kenneth Turan of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' observed,
{{blockquote|While the original film...saw itself as a catty entertainment about New York society women coping with the infidelity of the husband of one of their friends, English has something grander and more complex in mind...This version sees itself as both a farce and a manifesto, a glorification of female friendship and a celebration of women's need for self-realization...All that would be a handful to pull off for the most experienced filmmaker, but English has never directed before, and it shows. The visual choices she makes in ''The Women'' are invariably static, and except for whatever energy the performers can manage, the storytelling has a dispiriting flatness to it...The film becomes unfocused as it stumbles over all the points it wants to make. Given English's writing skills, the dialogue doesn't help as much as it should, tending too much toward one-liners that aim for raunchy whenever possible. Never particularly believable, the story quickly unravels into schematic contrivance and wish-fulfillment fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-women12-2008sep12,0,4883049.story |title=''Los Angeles Times'', September 12, 2008 |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2008-09-12 |accessdate=2010-05-03 | first=Kenneth | last=Turan}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

David Wiegand of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote,
{{blockquote|English doesn't make much of it very enjoyable. She's so careful to resist the Neanderthal sensibilities of the original film, she often neglects to make her version of the story, well, fun. Worse, it's only occasionally believable...Even those who never saw Cukor's movie will feel something is missing in English's version. Yes, some of what's missing is humor and snappy dialogue, but that could be forgiven, if only some of the characters were more believable and the direction not quite as uneven. English knows how to get good performances out of her cast, but her pacing is languid and sloppy, so much so that one is tempted to believe that for all she knows about pacing a 30-minute sitcom, English isn't quite ready to tackle the longer form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/11/DDRK12Q7IR.DTL |title=''San Francisco Chronicle'', September 12, 2008 |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2008-09-12 |accessdate=2010-05-03 | first=David | last=Wiegand}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film one out of four stars, calling it a "misbegotten redo" and "a major dud." He added, "Everyone...struggles with a script that resists being crowbarred into the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/22790868/review/22790877/the_women |title=''Rolling Stone'', September 18, 2008 |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called the film "one of the worst movies I've ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schickel |first=Richard |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1840522,00.html |title=''Time'' review |publisher=Time.com |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Eva Mendes, Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith each garnered a [[Razzie Award]] nomination for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

==Box office==
Despite the mostly negative reviews, the film was a moderate box office success. On its opening weekend, the film earned $10,115,210, ranking fourth behind ''[[Righteous Kill]]'', ''[[The Family That Preys]]'', and ''[[Burn After Reading]]''. The film eventually grossed $26,902,075 in the U.S. and $23,105,471 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $50,007,546.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=women08.htm |title=The Women (2008) |publisher=BoxOfficeMojo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD on December 19, 2008 in the U.S. and 19 March 2009 in the UK.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6653">A mathematical or physical process is '''time-reversible''' if the dynamics of the process remain well-defined when the sequence of time-states is reversed.

A [[Deterministic system|deterministic process]] is time-reversible if the time-reversed process satisfies the same [[dynamic equation (disambiguation)|dynamic equation]]s as the original process; in other words, the equations are [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] or [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] under a change in the [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] of time. A [[stochastic process]] is reversible if the statistical properties of the process are the same as the statistical properties for time-reversed data from the same process.

== Mathematics ==
In [[mathematics]], a [[dynamical system]] is time-reversible if the forward evolution is [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]], so that for every state there exists a transformation (an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]) π which gives a one-to-one mapping between the time-reversed evolution of any one state and the forward-time evolution of another corresponding state, given by the operator equation:

:&lt;math&gt;U_{-t} = \pi \, U_{t}\, \pi&lt;/math&gt;

Any time-independent structures (e.g. [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] or [[attractor]]s) which the dynamics give rise to must therefore either be self-symmetrical or have symmetrical images under the involution π.

== Physics ==
In [[physics]], the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] of [[classical mechanics]] exhibit time reversibility, as long as the operator π reverses the [[conjugate momentum|conjugate momenta]] of all the particles of the system, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \rightarrow  \mathbf{-p} &lt;/math&gt; ([[T-symmetry]]).

In [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] systems, however, the [[weak nuclear force]] is not invariant under T-symmetry alone; if weak interactions are present reversible dynamics are still possible, but only if the operator π also reverses the signs of all the [[charge (physics)|charges]] and the [[parity (physics)|parity]] of the spatial co-ordinates ([[C-symmetry]] and [[P-symmetry]]). This reversibility of several linked properties is known as [[CPT symmetry]].

[[Thermodynamic process]]es can be [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] or [[irreversible process|irreversible]], depending on the change in [[entropy]] during the process.

== Stochastic processes ==
A [[stochastic process]] is time-reversible if the joint probabilities of the forward and reverse state sequences are the same for all sets of time increments {&amp;nbsp;''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;}, for ''s'' = 1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''k'' for any ''k'':&lt;ref&gt;Tong (1990), Section 4.4&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;p(x_t, x_{t+\tau_1}, x_{t+\tau_2}, \ldots , x_{t+\tau_k}) = p(x_{t'}, x_{t'-\tau_1}, x_{t'-\tau_2} , \ldots , x_{t'-\tau_k})&lt;/math&gt;

A univariate stationary [[Gaussian process]] is time-reversible. [[Markov process]]es can only be reversible if their stationary distributions have the property of [[detailed balance]]:
:&lt;math&gt;p(x_t=i,x_{t+1}=j) = \,p(x_t=j,x_{t+1}=i)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Kolmogorov's criterion]] defines the condition for a [[Markov chain]] or [[continuous-time Markov chain]] to be time-reversible.

Time reversal of numerous classes of stochastic processes has been studied, including [[Lévy processes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacod | first1 = J. | last2 = Protter | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1214/aop/1176991776 | title = Time Reversal on Levy Processes | journal = The Annals of Probability | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 620 | year = 1988 | jstor = 2243828| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[stochastic network]]s ([[Kelly's lemma]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = F.

R. | last= Norris | authorlink = James R. Norris | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year =1998 | isbn = 0521633966}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[piecewise deterministic Markov processes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Löpker | first1 = A. | last2 = Palmowski | first2 = Z. | doi = 10.1214/EJP.v18-1958 | title = On time reversal of piecewise deterministic Markov processes | journal = Electronic Journal of Probability | volume = 18 | year = 2013 | arxiv = 1110.3813| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waves and optics==
Time reversal method works based on the linear reciprocity of the [[wave equation]], which states that the time reversed solution of a [[wave equation]] is also a solution to the [[wave equation]] since standard wave equations only contain even derivatives of the unknown variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parvasi|first1=Seyed Mohammad|last2=Ho|first2=Siu Chun Michael|last3=Kong|first3=Qingzhao|last4=Mousavi|first4=Reza|last5=Song|first5=Gangbing|title=Real time bolt preload monitoring using piezoceramic transducers and time reversal technique—a numerical study with experimental verification|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|date=19 July 2016|volume=25|issue=8|pages=085015|doi=10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085015|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085015/pdf|language=en|issn=0964-1726|bibcode=2016SMaS...25h5015P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[wave equation]] is symmetrical under time reversal, so the time reversal of any valid solution is also a solution. This means that a wave's path through space is valid when travelled in either direction.

[[Time reversal signal processing]] is a process in which this property is used to reverse a received signal; this signal is then re-emitted and a temporal compression occurs, resulting in a reverse of the initial excitation waveform being played at the initial source.

'''Trondhjems Kunstforening''' ({{lang-en|Trondhjem Art Society}}) is an art society in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]].

It was founded in 1845 on the initiative of Lars Hansen and [[I. C. Dahl]], to promote and display art in [[Trondheim|Trondhjem]]. The first exhibition was held in [[Stiftsgården]] in 1846. In 1930 the organisation erected its own localities in ''Bispegata'', designed by [[Peter Daniel Hofflund]]. In 1996 it was behind the founding of the museum [[Trondheim Kunstmuseum]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Trondhjems Kunstforening|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=|publisher=|location=|url=http://www.snl.no/Trondhjems_Kunstforening|language=Norwegian|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6313">'''Virgilius the Sorcerer''' is a [[fairy tale]] about the poet [[Virgil]] by [[Andrew Lang]] who included it in ''[[The Violet Fairy Book]]''.

==Virgil's powers==
Medieval legends attributed [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers to the poet [[Virgil#Mysticism and hidden meanings|Virgil]], but even among these legends, this tale attributes a very high level of power to him.

Among his accomplishments in the tale, Virgilius is a quick thinker, using his magical powers to defeat corruption and military attacks and spirits. One of his spells was to make an army immobile, turn men to stone, or create a river out of nowhere, encircling them so they could not proceed. Although he wins many challenges, including a magician's battle, wily schemes also help his cause. Among his creations, he invents and animates a horse, rider and dogs out of copper to assert his will.

Virgilius avenges the trickery of his first love for publicly humiliating him before finding true love at last, and creating the city of [[Naples]] for her.

==Synopsis==
The story begins –
&lt;blockquote&gt;Long, long ago there was born to a Roman knight and his wife Maja a little boy called Virgilius. While he was still quite little, his father died, and the kinsmen, instead of being a help and protection to the child and his mother, robbed them of their lands and money, and the widow, fearing that they might take the boy's life also, sent him away to [[Spain]], that he might study in the great University of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One holiday, when walking, he came upon an evil spirit that was trapped; the spirit offered him magical books in exchange for setting him free. Virgilius demanded the books, and the knowledge how to use them, first; then he freed the spirit. It grew to an enormous size, so the quick-witted Virgilius declared he did not believe it came out of the hole, and the spirit, to prove it, went back in whereupon Virgilius quickly trapped it again.

He studied magic for many days gaining a wonderful reputation for his powers ("he was much thought of as showing promise of great learning"). This was cut short when his mother sent for him because she was ill and could no longer look after their affairs. When he arrived home, his rich relatives were displeased because his presence meant they could no longer rob their kinsmen. They were, however, related to the emperor, who put off the matter of giving Virgilius his due. His enemies attacked him but Virgilius used his magic to drive them off or cast spells on them. The emperor himself went to him without effect until a magician came into camp and was hired to battle Virgilius. Virgilius had a hard time fighting the magician, but reached the emperor in secret with a proposition: he would stop the fight if he could have justice, compelling the emperor to agree.

Virgilius then fell in love with a woman named Febilla. She told him that she would let him visit her by drawing him up in a basket to a tower. Once he was in the basket, she lifted it only half way, leaving him a dangling target of the crowd's ridicule. The emperor ordered his release, but the next day, no fire in Rome would light. Virgilius told them to bring Febilla to a scaffold in the market place and take fire from her. Fire started about her and she had to stand there until everyone had re-lit their fires. The emperor threw Virgilius into prison with a death sentence,  but when he was brought up, thirsty Virgilius asked for water. When the guards brought him a pail of water, Virgilius jumped into it, saying he was going to Sicily and magically vanished.

Andrew Lang has heavily bowdlerized his sources here; in the original Medieval tradition, the fire could only be rekindled from her vagina. The story was very popular with Renaissance artists. The [[Metropolitan Museum]] has a Venetian ''confittiera'' (ca. 1475&amp;ndash;1500) showing Febilla standing on the square with raised skirt, a gift by [[J. Pierpont Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/arlo/ho_17.190.730a,b.htm Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://alaintruong.canalblog.com/archives/2008/11/23/11465448.html Les cahiers d'Alain Truong]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on Rome===
The fairy tale says that it is unknown how he reconciled with the emperor, but he next made statues of the gods of every country, including Rome, with bells in their hands, and the bells would ring if they intended treachery toward Rome, so the Romans would send their armies against them. 

A country that hated them sent men to Rome; they claimed to be diviners and to have dreamed of gold, and then, with the Senate's permission, dug up the gold they had buried the night before. The [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] time, they told the Senate it was under the Capitol and they would dig for them, for their generosity; they undermined the Capitol and stole away. Immediately after, the statues fell and were ruined.  

Much crime followed in the city. Virgilius had a copper horse and rider made and ordered all men indoors. Only the honest obeyed, and the horse trampled those it found outside. The next day, the surviving thieves tried to use ropes and grapples to stop it, and used rope ladders to escape it. Two copper dogs were added, to jump up and bite them to death.

Virgilius fell in love with a foreign princess, the daughter of a sultan, and carried her away from her father. She was a guest in his house, wondering at the marvels, until she wished to return to her father. Virgilius returned her, but the sultan ordered his death. Virgilius cast a spell on him and his court and carried the princess away again. Then, thinking Rome not fine enough, he built a marvelous city for her, which was [[Naples]].

==Commentary==
The technique of tricking  spirit is a motif also found in ''[[The Spirit in the Bottle]]'' and with genies in ''[[The Fisherman and the Jinni]]''.

The legend that he had been trapped in a basket was a common medieval tale, warning of the power of love to make fools of men.

There is a reference to the "Black Book" he uses as the source of his spells which in popular culture can be a book containing lists or evil deeds.

It is one of the most famous manuscripts of the Shahnameh, dating from 1648. The painters are [[Muhammad Qasim (painter)|Muhammad Qasim]] and [[Mohammad Yusef the Painter|Muhammad Yusuf]].&lt;ref name="Boyle2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=John A Boyle|title=Persia (RLE Iran A): History and Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JL2NOXXCHPsC&amp;pg=PA87|date=4 May 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-82110-3|pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miniatures of this Shahnameh are very similar to the miniatures of the [[Shahnameh of Rashida]], and therefore it has been suggested that these manuscripts have been prepared by same painters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hosseini|first1=Mehdi|title=Shahnameh of Qarajaghay Khan|url=https://jfava.ut.ac.ir/article_23314_2338.html|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Windsor Shahnameh contains 148 or 149 miniatures and is written in [[Nastaʿlīq script]] by [[Mohammad Hakim Hosseini]] to the order of [[Qarachaqay Khan]] (one of the commanders-in-chief of [[Abbas I of Persia]]). It is in very good condition compared to other manuscripts of the Shahnameh . It is not clear how and when this version of the Shahnameh was acquired by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] and subsequently his heir, [[Shahzada Kamran Durrani|Kamran Shah]]. In 1839, the Windsor Shahnameh was presented to [[Queen Victoria]] by Kamran Shah, for her support of the Afghans against the [[Qajar dynasty]]. The manuscript is now in the [[Royal Collection]] and usually in the library at [[Windsor Castle]].
