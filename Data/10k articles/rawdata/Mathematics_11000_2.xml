In [[set theory]], when dealing with sets of infinite size, the term '''almost''' or '''nearly''' is used to mean ''all the elements except for finitely many''.

In other words, an infinite set ''S'' that is a [[subset]] of another infinite set ''L'', is '''almost''' ''L'' if the subtracted set ''L''\''S'' is of finite size.

Examples:
*The set &lt;math&gt; S = \{ n \in \mathbf{N} | n \ge k \} &lt;/math&gt; is almost '''N''' for any ''k'' in '''N''', because only finitely many [[natural number]]s are less than ''k''.
*The set of [[prime number]]s is not almost '''N''' because there are infinitely many natural numbers that are not prime numbers.

This is conceptually similar to the ''[[almost everywhere]]'' concept of [[measure theory]], but is not the same.  For example, the [[Cantor set]] is [[uncountable set|uncountably infinite]], but has [[Lebesgue measure]] zero.  So a [[real number]] in (0, 1) is a member of the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of the Cantor set ''almost everywhere'', but it is not true that the complement of the Cantor set is ''almost'' the real numbers in (0, 1).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8272">[[file:Asreturn.png|framed|right|In traditional investments, the volatile ([[beta (finance)|beta]]) investments are managed to balance risk and return. For alternative investments, this management is called "alternative beta".]]

'''Alternative beta''' is the concept of managing [[Volatility (finance)|volatile]] "[[alternative investment]]s", often through the use of [[hedge funds]]. Alternative beta is often also referred to as "alternative risk premia".

Researcher [[Lars Jaeger]] says that the return from an investment mainly results from exposure to systematic risk factors. These exposures can take two basic forms: long only "buy and hold" exposures and exposures through the use of alternative investment techniques such as long/short investing, the use of derivatives (non-linear payout profiles), or the employment of leverage)&lt;ref name=Jaeger /&gt;

==Background==
===Alternative investments===
{{main|hedge funds}}
Although [[alternative investment]] is a general term, (commonly defined as any investment other than stocks, bonds or cash), alternative beta relates to the use of [[hedge funds]]. At its most basic, a '''hedge fund''' is an investment vehicle that pools capital from a number of investors and invests in securities and other instruments.&lt;ref name=Lins&gt;Gerald T. Lins, Thomas P. Lemke, Kathryn L. Hoenig &amp; Patricia Schoor Rube, ''Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds:  Regulation and Compliance'' §1:1 (2014 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is administered by a professional management firm, and often structured as a [[limited partnership]], [[limited liability company]], or similar vehicle.&lt;ref name=McCrary&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zqVDo9_hQQC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=pooled+investment+hedge+fund&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ETU3UtelDuaQigLGuYFA&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=pooled%20investment%20hedge%20fund&amp;f=false |author=Stuart A. McCrary |title=How to Create and Manage a Hedge Fund: A Professional's Guide |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2002 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction to Hedge Funds |pages=7–8 |isbn=047122488X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PWGOFM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Documents/hedgfund.pdf |format=pdf |title=Hedge Funds, Leverage, and the Lessons of Long-Term Capital Management |author=The President's Working Group on Financial Markets |publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury |date=April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volatility ("beta")===
{{main|beta (finance)}}
For an investment that involves risk to be worthwhile, its returns must be higher than a risk-free investment. The risk is related to [[volatility (finance)|volatility]].

A measure of the factors influencing an investment's volatility is the '''beta'''. The beta is a measure of the risk arising from exposure to general [[Market (economics)|market]] movements as opposed to idiosyncratic factors.

A beta below 1 can indicate either an investment with lower volatility than the market, or a volatile investment whose price movements are not highly [[correlation and dependence|correlated]] with the market. An example of the first is a [[United States Treasury security|treasury]] bill: the price does not go up or down a lot, so it has a low beta. An example of the second is [[gold]]. The price of gold does go up and down a lot, but not in the same direction or at the same time as the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Sharpe
 | first = William
 | year = 1970
 | title = Portfolio Theory and Capital Markets
 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Trade
 | isbn = 978-0071353205
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A beta above 1 generally means that the asset both is volatile and tends to move up and down with the market. An example is a stock in a big technology company. Negative betas are possible for investments that tend to go down when the market goes up, and vice versa. There are few fundamental investments with consistent and significant negative betas, but some [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] like [[equity (finance)|equity]] [[put option]]s can have large negative beta values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Markowitz
 | first = Harry
 | year = 1958
 | title = Portfolio Selection
 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons
 | isbn = 978-1557861085
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investments with a high beta value are often called "beta investments", as opposed to "alpha investments" which typically have lower volatility and lower returns.

==Volatility and hedge funds==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
Separating returns into alpha and [[beta (finance)|beta]] can also be applied to determine the amount and type of fees to charge. The consensus is to charge higher fees for alpha (incl. performance fee), since it is mostly viewed as skill based. The topic has received increasing levels of attention due to the very rapid growth of the [[hedge fund]] industry, where investment companies typically charge fees higher than those of [[mutual fund]]s, based on the assumption that hedge funds are alpha investments. Investors have started to question whether hedge funds are actually alpha investments, or just some “new” form of beta (i.e. ''alternative beta'').

This issue was raised in the 1997 paper "Empirical Characteristics of Dynamic Trading Strategies: The Case of Hedge Funds" by William Fung and David Hsieh. Following this paper, several groups of academics (such as [[Thomas Schneeweis]] et al.) started to explain past hedge fund returns using various systematic risk factors (i.e. Alternative Betas). Following this, a paper has discussed whether investable strategies based on such factors can not only explain past returns, but also replicate future ones.&lt;ref name = Jaeger&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jaeger|first1=Lars|title=Factor Modeling and Benchmarking of Hedge Funds: Can Passive Investments in Hedge Fund Strategies Deliver?|ssrn=811185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different betas based on different investment exposures==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
{{too technical|section|date=September 2014}}
Traditional betas can be seen as those related to investments the common investor would already be experienced with (examples include [[stock]]s and most [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]). They are typically represented through indexation, and the techniques employed here are what is called “long only”. The definition of alternative beta in contrast requires the consideration of other investment techniques such as short selling, use of derivatives and leverage - techniques which are often associated with the activities of hedge funds. The underlying non-traditional investment risks are often seen as being riskier, as investors are less familiar with them.

==Alpha and investments and beta investments==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
{{too technical|section|date=September 2014}}
Viewed from the implementation side, investment techniques and strategies are the means to either capture risk premia (beta) or to obtain excess returns (alpha). Whereas returns from beta are a result of exposing the portfolio to systematic risks (traditional or alternative), alpha is an exceptional return that an investor or portfolio manager earns due to his unique skill, i.e. exploiting market inefficiencies. Academic studies as well as their performance in recent years strongly support the idea that the return from hedge funds mostly consists of (alternative) risk premia. This is the basis of the various approaches to replicate the return profile of hedge funds by direct exposures to alternative beta (hedge fund replication).

==Hedge fund replication==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
{{too technical|section|date=September 2014}}
There are currently two main approaches to replicate the return profile of hedge funds based on the idea of Alternative Betas:{{clarify|date=September 2014}}
# directly extracting the risk premia (bottom up), an approach developed and advocated by Lars Jaeger
# the factor-based approach based on Sharpe's factor models and developed for hedge funds first by professors Bill Fung ([[London Business School]]), David Hsieh ([[Fuqua School of Business]], [[Duke University]]) et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7474">In [[mathematics]], a '''Banach manifold''' is a [[manifold]] modeled on [[Banach spaces]]. Thus it is a [[topological space]] in which each point has a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] [[homeomorphic]] to an [[open set]] in a Banach space (a more involved and formal definition is given below). Banach manifolds are one possibility of extending manifolds to [[Infinity|infinite]] [[dimension]]s.

A further generalisation is to [[Fréchet manifold]]s, replacing Banach spaces by [[Fréchet space]]s. On the other hand, a [[Hilbert manifold]] is a special case of a Banach manifold in which the manifold is locally modelled on [[Hilbert space]]s.

==Definition==
Let ''X'' be a [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. An '''[[Atlas (topology)|atlas]] of class''' ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''r''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, on ''X'' is a collection of pairs (called '''[[Atlas (topology)#Charts|charts]]''') (''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I'', such that
# each ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[subset]] of ''X'' and the [[union (set theory)|union]] of the ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the whole of ''X'';
# each ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[bijection]] from ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; onto an [[open subset]] ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) of some Banach space ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, and for any ''i'' and ''j'', ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''U''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) is open in ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;;
# the crossover map

::&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{j} \circ \varphi_{i}^{-1} : \varphi_{i} (U_{i} \cap U_{j}) \to \varphi_{j} (U_{i} \cap U_{j})&lt;/math&gt;

: is an [[Smooth function|''r''-times continuously differentiable]] function for every ''i'' and ''j'' in ''I'', i.e. the ''r''th [[Fréchet derivative]]

::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}^{r} \big( \varphi_{j} \circ \varphi_{i}^{-1} \big) : \varphi_{i} (U_{i} \cap U_{j}) \to \mathrm{Lin} \big( E_{i}^{r}; E_{j} \big) &lt;/math&gt;

: exists and is a [[continuous function]] with respect to the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;-[[norm (mathematics)|norm]] [[topology]] on subsets of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[operator norm]] topology on Lin(''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;;&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.)

One can then show that there is a unique [[topology]] on ''X'' such that each ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is open and each ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[homeomorphism]]. Very often, this topological space is assumed to be a [[Hausdorff space]], but this is not necessary from the point of view of the formal definition.

If all the Banach spaces ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are equal to the same space ''E'', the atlas is called an ''E'''''-atlas'''. However, it is not ''[[Wiktionary:A priori|a priori]]'' necessary that the Banach spaces ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the same space, or even [[isomorphic]] as [[topological vector space]]s. However, if two charts (''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''U''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) are such that ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; have a non-empty [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], a quick examination of the [[derivative (generalizations)|derivative]] of the crossover map

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{j} \circ \varphi_{i}^{-1} : \varphi_{i} (U_{i} \cap U_{j}) \to \varphi_{j} (U_{i} \cap U_{j})&lt;/math&gt;

shows that ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; must indeed be isomorphic as topological vector spaces. Furthermore, the set of points ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' for which there is a chart (''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) with ''x'' in ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; isomorphic to a given Banach space ''E'' is both open and [[closed subset|closed]]. Hence, one can without loss of generality assume that, on each [[connected space|connected component]] of ''X'', the atlas is an ''E''-atlas for some fixed ''E''.

A new chart (''U'',&amp;nbsp;''φ'') is called '''compatible''' with a given atlas {&amp;nbsp;(''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I''&amp;nbsp;} if the crossover map

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{i} \circ \varphi^{-1} : \varphi (U \cap U_{i}) \to \varphi_{i} (U \cap U_{i})&lt;/math&gt;

is an ''r''-times continuously differentiable function for every ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I''. Two atlases are called compatible if every chart in one is compatible with the other atlas. Compatibility defines an [[equivalence relation]] on the class of all possible atlases on ''X''.

A ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;'''-manifold''' structure on ''X'' is then defined to be a choice of equivalence class of atlases on ''X'' of class ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;. If all the Banach spaces ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are isomorphic as topological vector spaces (which is guaranteed to be the case if ''X'' is [[connected space|connected]]), then an equivalent atlas can be found for which they are all equal to some Banach space ''E''. ''X'' is then called an ''E'''''-manifold''', or one says that ''X'' is '''modeled''' on ''E''.

==Examples==
* If (''X'',&amp;nbsp;||⋅||) is a Banach space, then ''X'' is a Banach manifold with an atlas containing a single, globally-defined chart (the [[identity function|identity map]]).
* Similarly, if ''U'' is an open subset of some Banach space, then ''U'' is a Banach manifold.  (See the classification theorem below.)

==Classification up to homeomorphism==
It is by no means true that a finite-dimensional manifold of dimension ''n'' is ''globally'' homeomorphic to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, or even an open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. However, in an infinite-dimensional setting, it is possible to classify “[[well-behaved]]” Banach manifolds up to homeomorphism quite nicely. A 1969 theorem of David Henderson states that every infinite-dimensional, [[separable space|separable]], [[metric space|metric]] Banach manifold ''X'' can be [[embedding|embedded]] as an open subset of the infinite-dimensional, separable Hilbert space, ''H'' (up to linear isomorphism, there is only one such space). In fact, Henderson's result is stronger:  the same conclusion holds for any metric manifold modeled on a separable infinite-dimensional [[Fréchet space]].

The embedding homeomorphism can be used as a global chart for ''X''. Thus, in the infinite-dimensional, separable, metric case, the “only” Banach manifolds are the open subsets of Hilbert space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10120">In mathematics, the '''Bogomolov–Miyaoka–Yau inequality''' is the inequality

:&lt;math&gt; c_1^2 \le 3 c_2&lt;/math&gt;

between [[Chern number]]s  of [[compact space|compact]] [[algebraic surface|complex surfaces]] of [[surfaces of general type|general type]]. Its major interest is the way it restricts the possible topological types of the underlying real 4-manifold. It was proved independently by {{harvs|txt|last=Yau|first=Shing-Tung|authorlink=Shing-Tung Yau| year1=1977|year2=1978}} and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Yoichi Miyaoka|first=Yoichi|last=Miyaoka|year=1977}}, after {{harvs|txt|last=Van de Ven|first=Antonius|year=1966}} and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Fedor Bogomolov|first=Fedor|last=Bogomolov|year=1978}} proved weaker versions with the constant 3 replaced by 8 and 4.

[[Armand Borel]] and [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]] showed that the inequality is  best possible by finding infinitely many cases where equality holds. The inequality is false in positive characteristic: {{harvs|txt|first=William E. |last=Lang|year=1983}} and {{harvs|txt|last=Easton|first=Robert W.|year=2008}} gave examples of surfaces in characteristic ''p'', such as [[generalized Raynaud surface]]s, for which it fails.

==Formulation of the inequality==
The conventional formulation of the Bogomolov–Miyaoka–Yau inequality is as follows. Let ''X'' be a compact complex surface of [[general type]], and let ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') be the first and second [[Chern class]] of the complex tangent bundle of the surface.  Then

: &lt;math&gt; c_1^2 \le 3 c_2. &lt;/math&gt;

Moreover if equality holds then ''X'' is a quotient of a ball. The latter statement is a consequence of Yau's differential geometric approach which is based on his resolution of the [[Calabi conjecture]].
 
Since &lt;math&gt; c_2(X) = e(X) &lt;/math&gt; is the topological [[Euler characteristic]] and by the [[Hirzebruch signature theorem|Thom–Hirzebruch signature theorem]] &lt;math&gt; c_1^2(X) = 2 e(X) + 3\sigma(X) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the signature of the [[Intersection form (4-manifold)|intersection form]] on the second cohomology, the Bogomolov–Miyaoka–Yau inequality can also be written as a restriction on the topological type of the surface of general type:

:&lt;math&gt;  \sigma(X) \le \frac{1}{3} e(X), &lt;/math&gt;

moreover if &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X) = (1/3)e(X)&lt;/math&gt; then the universal covering is a ball.

Together with the [[Noether inequality]] the Bogomolov–Miyaoka–Yau inequality sets boundaries in the search for complex surfaces. Mapping out the topological types that are realized as complex surfaces is called [[geography of surfaces]]. see [[Surface of general type|surfaces of general type]].

==Surfaces with ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 3''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ==

If ''X'' is a surface of general type with &lt;math&gt; c_1^2 = 3 c_2&lt;/math&gt;, so that  equality holds in the Bogomolov–Miyaoka–Yau inequality,  then {{harvtxt|Yau|1977}} proved that ''X'' is isomorphic to a quotient of the unit ball in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb C}^2&lt;/math&gt; by an infinite discrete group. Examples of surfaces satisfying this equality are hard to find.  {{harvtxt|Borel|1963}} showed that there are infinitely many values of ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} = 3''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for which a surface exists. {{harvs|txt|last=Mumford|first=David|authorlink=David Mumford|year=1979}} found a [[fake projective plane]] with ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} = 3''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 9, which is the minimum possible value because ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is always divisible by 12, and {{harvtxt|Prasad|Yeung|2007}}, {{harvtxt|Prasad|Yeung|2010}}, {{harvs|txt | last1=Cartwright | first1=Donald I. | last2=Steger | first2=Tim | title=Enumeration of the 50 fake projective planes | publisher=Elsevier Masson SAS  | doi=10.1016/j.crma.2009.11.016 | journal=[[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences|Comptes Rendus Mathématique]] | volume=348 | issue=1 | pages=11–13|year=2010}} showed that there are exactly 50 fake projective planes.

{{harvtxt|Barthel|Hirzebruch|Höfer|1987}} gave a method for finding examples, which in particular produced a surface ''X'' with ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} = 3''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. 
{{harvtxt|Ishida|1988}} found a quotient of this surface with ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} = 3''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 45, and taking unbranched coverings of this quotient gives examples with ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} = 3''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 45''k'' for any positive integer ''k''.

'''Booleo''' (stylized ''bOOleO'') is a strategy card game using [[George Boole|boolean]] [[logic gate]]s. It was developed by Jonathan Brandt and Chris Kampf with Sean P. Dennis in 2008, and it was first published by Tessera Games LLC in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/40943/booleo&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game==
The deck consists of 64 cards:
:* 48 “Gate” cards using three Boolean operators [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[XOR Gate|XOR]]
:::8 '''OR''' cards resolving to 1
:::8 '''OR''' cards resolving to 0
:::8 '''AND''' cards resolving to 1
:::8 '''AND''' cards resolving to 0
:::8 '''XOR''' cards resolving to 1
:::8 '''XOR''' cards resolving to 0

:* 8 '''[[NOT gate|NOT]]''' cards

:* 6 '''Initial Binary''' cards, each displaying a “0” and a “1” aligned to the two short ends of the card

:* 2 '''[[Truth table|Truth Tables]]''' (used for reference, not in play)

==Play==
Starting with a line of Initial Binary cards laid perpendicular to two facing players, the object of the game is to be the first to complete a logical pyramid whose final output equals that of the rightmost Initial Binary card facing that player.

The game is played in “draw one play one” format. The pyramid consists of decreasing rows of gate cards, where the outputs of any contiguous pair of cards comprise the input values to a single card in the following row. The pyramid, therefore, has Initial Binary values as its base and tapers to a single card closest to the player. By tracing the “flow” of values through any series of gate, every card placed in the pyramid must make “logical sense”, i.e. the inputs and output value of every gate card must conform to the rule of that gate card.

The '''NOT''' cards are played against any of the Initial Binary cards in play, causing that card to be rotated 180 degrees, literally “flipping” the value of that card from 0 to 1 or vice versa.

By changing the value of any Initial Binary, any and all gate cards which “flow” from it must be re-evaluated to ensure its placement makes “logical sense”. If it does not, that gate card is removed from the player's pyramid.

Since both players' pyramids share the Initial Binary cards as a base, “flipping” an Initial Binary has an effect on both players' pyramids. A principal strategy during game play is to invalidate gate cards in the opponent's logic pyramid while rendering as little damage to one’s own pyramid in the process.

Some logic gates are more robust than others to a change to their inputs. Therefore, not all logic gate cards have the same strategic value. 

The standard edition of the game does not contain NAND, NOR, or XNOR gates. It is possible, therefore, for a player to arrive at an unresolvable pair of inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somma|first1=Ryan|title=A Game of Boolean Logic Gates with an Ambiguous Spelling|url=http://ideonexus.com/2010/02/15/b00le0-booleo-booleo-a-game-of-boolean-logic-gates-with-an-ambiguous-spelling|website=Geeking Out|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
The number of cards in Booleo will comfortably support a match between two players whose logic pyramids are six cards wide at their base. By combining decks, it is possible to construct larger pyramids or to have matches among more than two players. For example:
:* Four players may play individually or as facing teams by arranging a cross of Initial Binary cards, where four logic pyramids extend like compass points in four directions
:* Four or more players may build partially overlapping pyramids from a long base of Initial Binary cards

Tessera Games also published ''bOOleO-N Edition'', which is identical to Booleo with the exception that it uses the inverse set of logic gates: [[NAND gate|NAND]], [[NOR Gate|NOR]], and [[XNOR Gate|XNOR]]. bOOleO-N Edition may be played on its own, or it may be combined with Booleo.

In [[probability theory]], '''conditional probability''' is a measure of the [[probability]] of an [[Event (probability theory)|event]] (some particular situation occurring) given that (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) another event has occurred.&lt;ref name="Allan Gut 2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gut |first=Allan |title=Probability: A Graduate Course |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-1-4614-4707-8 |edition=Second }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the event of interest is ''A'' and the event ''B'' is known or assumed to have occurred, "the conditional probability of ''A'' given ''B''", or "the probability of ''A'' under the condition ''B''", is usually written as ''P''(''A''|''B''), or sometimes ''P''{{sub|''B''}}(''A'') or ''P''(''A''/''B''). For example, the probability that any given person has a cough on any given day may be only 5%. But if we know or assume that the person has a [[Common cold|cold]], then they are much more likely to be coughing. The conditional probability of coughing given that you have a cold might be a much higher 75%.

The concept of conditional probability is one of the most fundamental and one of the most important concepts in probability theory.&lt;ref name="Sheldon Ross 2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sheldon |last=Ross |title=A First Course in Probability |edition=8th |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-603313-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But conditional probabilities can be quite slippery and require careful interpretation.&lt;ref name="Casella and Berger 2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Casella |first2=Roger L. |last2=Berger |title=Statistical Inference |year=2002 |publisher=Duxbury Press |location= |isbn=0-534-24312-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there need not be a causal relationship between ''A'' and ''B'', and they don’t have to occur simultaneously.

''P''(''A''|''B'') may or may not be equal to ''P''(''A'') (the unconditional probability of ''A'').  If ''P''(''A''|''B'') = ''P''(''A''), then events ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be independent: in such a case, having knowledge about either event does not change our knowledge about the other event.  Also, in general, ''P''(''A''|''B'') (the conditional probability of A given B) is not equal to ''P''(''B''|''A''). For example, if a person has dengue they might have a 90% chance of testing positive for dengue.  In this case what is being measured is that if event ''B'' ("having dengue") has occurred, the probability of ''A'' (''test is positive'') given that ''B'' (''having dengue'') occurred is 90%: that is, ''P''(''A''|''B'')  = 90%.  Alternatively, if a person tests positive for dengue they may have only a 15% chance of actually having dengue because most people do not have dengue and the [[false positive]] rate for the test may be high. In this case what is being measured is the probability of the event  ''B'' (''having dengue'') given that the event ''A'' (''test is positive'') has occurred: ''P''(''B''|''A'') = 15%.     Falsely equating the two probabilities causes various errors of reasoning such as the [[base rate fallacy]]. Conditional probabilities can be correctly reversed using [[Bayes' theorem]].

Conditional probabilities can be displayed in a [[conditional probability table]].

[[File:Conditional probability.svg|thumb|Illustration of conditional probabilities with an [[Euler diagram]]. The unconditional [[probability]] ''P''(''A'') = 0.30 + 0.10 + 0.12 = 0.52. However, the conditional probability ''P''(''A''&amp;#124;''B''{{sub|1}}) = 1, ''P''(''A''&amp;#124;''B''{{sub|2}}) = 0.12 ÷ (0.12 + 0.04) = 0.75, and ''P''(''A''&amp;#124;''B''{{sub|3}}) = 0.]]

=== Conditioning on an event ===

==== Kolmogorov definition ====
Given two [[event (probability theory)|events]] ''A'' and ''B'', from the [[sigma-field]] of a probability space, with the [[marginal probability|unconditional probability]] of B (that is, of the event ''B'' occurring ) being greater than zero – ''P''(''B'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 – the conditional probability of ''A'' given ''B'' is defined as the [[quotient]] of the probability of the joint of events ''A'' and ''B'', and the [[probability]] of ''B''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last=Kolmogorov|first=Andrey|title=Foundations of the Theory of Probability||publisher=Chelsea|year=1956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that both events ''A'' and ''B'' occur. This may be visualized as restricting the sample space to situations in which ''B'' occurs. The logic behind this equation is that if the possible outcomes for ''A'' and ''B'' are restricted to  those in which ''B'' occurs, this set serves as the new sample space.

Note that this is a definition but not a theoretical result. We just denote the quantity &lt;math&gt;\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;P(A|B)&lt;/math&gt; and call it the conditional probability of ''A'' given ''B''.

==== As an axiom of probability ====
Some authors, such as [[Bruno de Finetti|de Finetti]], prefer to introduce conditional probability as an [[Probability axioms|axiom of probability]]:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B) = P(A \mid B)P(B)&lt;/math&gt;

Although mathematically equivalent, this may be preferred philosophically; under major [[probability interpretations]] such as the [[Subjective probability|subjective theory]], conditional probability is considered a primitive entity. Further, this "multiplication axiom" introduces a symmetry with the summation axiom for [[mutually exclusive events]]:&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, Donald (2000); "Philosophical Theories of Probability"; Routledge; Chapter 4 "The subjective theory"&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - \cancelto0{P(A \cap B)}&lt;/math&gt;

==== As the probability of a conditional event ====

Conditional probability can be defined as the probability of a conditional event 
&lt;math&gt;A_B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Draheim2017c&gt;{{cite web|last= Draheim|first=Dirk|title=An Operational Semantics of Conditional Probabilities that Fully Adheres to Kolmogorov's Explication of Probability Theory|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.10050.48323/3|year=2017 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322117507_An_Operational_Semantics_of_Conditional_Probabilities_that_Fully_Adheres_to_Kolmogorov's_Explication_of_Probability_Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Assuming that the experiment underlying the events &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is repeated, the 
[[Goodman–Nguyen–van Fraassen algebra|Goodman-Nguyen-van Fraassen]]
conditional event can be defined as 

:&lt;math&gt;A_B = 
\bigcup_{i \ge 1} 
\bigl (
\underset{j &lt; i}{\cap}
\overline{B_j}, 
A_i
B_i  
\bigr ) 
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that 

:&lt;math&gt;P(A_B)= \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}&lt;/math&gt;

which meets the Kolmogorov definition of conditional probability. Note that the equation 
&lt;math&gt;P(A_B)= P(A \cap B)/ P(B)&lt;/math&gt; is a theoretical result and not a definition. 
The definition via conditional events can be understood directly in terms of the [[Probability axioms|Kolmogorov axioms]] and is particularly close to the Kolmogorov [[Probability interpretations|interpretation of probability]] in terms of experimental data. For example, conditional events can be repeated themselves leading to a generalized notion of conditional event 
&lt;math&gt;A_{B(n)}&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown&lt;ref name="Draheim2017c" /&gt; that the sequence 
&lt;math&gt;(A_{B(n)})_{n \ge 1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|i.i.d.]], which yields a [[Law of large numbers|strong law of large numbers]] for conditional probability:

:&lt;math&gt; 
P(
\underset{n \longrightarrow \infty}{\lim}
\overline{A_B^n} = P(A|B)
)=100\%
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Measure-theoretic definition ===
If ''P''(''B'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, then according to the simple definition, ''P''(''A''|''B'') is [[defined and undefined|undefined]]. However, it is possible to define a conditional probability with respect to a [[sigma algebra|σ-algebra]] of such events (such as those arising from a [[continuous random variable]]).

For example, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are non-degenerate and jointly continuous random variables with density ''ƒ''{{sub|''X'',''Y''}}(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') then, if ''B'' has positive [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]],
:&lt;math&gt;
P(X \in A \mid Y \in B) =
\frac{\int_{y\in B}\int_{x\in A} f_{X,Y}(x,y)\,dx\,dy}{\int_{y\in B}\int_{x\in\mathbb R} f_{X,Y}(x,y)\,dx\,dy} .&lt;/math&gt;

The case where ''B'' has zero measure is problematic. For the case that ''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''y''{{sub|0}}}, representing a single point, the conditional probability could be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
P(X \in A \mid Y = y_0) = \frac{\int_{x\in A} f_{X,Y}(x,y_0)\,dx}{\int_{x\in\mathbb R} f_{X,Y}(x,y_0)\,dx},
&lt;/math&gt;

however this approach leads to the [[Borel–Kolmogorov paradox]]. The more general case of zero measure is even more problematic, as can be seen by noting that the limit, as all ''δy''{{sub|''i''}} approach zero, of
:&lt;math&gt;
P(X \in A \mid Y \in \cup_i[y_i,y_i+\delta y_i]) \approxeq
\frac{\sum_{i} \int_{x\in A} f_{X,Y}(x,y_i)\,dx\,\delta y_i}{\sum_{i}\int_{x\in\mathbb R} f_{X,Y}(x,y_i) \,dx\, \delta y_i} , &lt;/math&gt;
depends on their relationship as they approach zero. See [[conditional expectation]] for more information.

=== Conditioning on a random variable ===
Conditioning on an event may be generalized to conditioning on a random variable. Let ''X'' be a random variable; we assume for the sake of presentation that ''X'' is discrete, that is, ''X'' takes on only finitely many values ''x''. Let ''A'' be an event. The conditional probability of ''A'' given ''X'' is defined as the random variable, written ''P''(''A''|''X'')'', that takes on the value
:&lt;math&gt; P(A\mid X=x) &lt;/math&gt;

whenever
:&lt;math&gt;X=x.&lt;/math&gt;

More formally,
:&lt;math&gt;P(A|X)(\omega)=P(A\mid X=X(\omega)) .&lt;/math&gt;

The conditional probability ''P''(''A''|''X'') is a function of ''X'': e.g., if the function ''g'' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;g(x)= P(A\mid X=x),&lt;/math&gt;

then
:&lt;math&gt;P(A|X) =g\circ X.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that ''P''(''A''|''X'') and ''X'' are now both [[random variable]]s. From the [[law of total probability]], the [[expected value]] of ''P''(''A''|''X'') is equal to the unconditional [[probability]] of ''A''.

=== Partial conditional probability ===

The partial conditional probability 
&lt;math&gt;P(A|B_1 \equiv b_1 \cdots B_m \equiv b_m)&lt;/math&gt;
is about the probability of event 
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; given that each of the condition events
&lt;math&gt;B_i&lt;/math&gt; has occurred to a degree
&lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; (degree of belief, degree of experience) that might be different from 100%. Frequentistically, partial conditional probability makes sense, if the conditions are tested in experiment repetitions of appropriate length 
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;ref name=Draheim2017b&gt;{{cite web|last= Draheim|first=Dirk|title=Generalized Jeffrey Conditionalization (A Frequentist Semantics of Partial Conditionalization)| url=http://fpc.formcharts.org|publisher=Springer|accessdate=December 19, 2017|year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Such 
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-bounded partial conditional probability can be defined as the [[Conditional expectation|conditionally expected]] average occurrence of event
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in testbeds of length 
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; that adhere to all of the probability specifications
&lt;math&gt;B_i \equiv b_i&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.:

:&lt;math&gt;P^n(A|B_1 \equiv b_1 \cdots B_m \equiv b_m)=
E(\overline{A^n}|\overline{B^n_1}=b_1 \cdots \overline{B^n_m}=b_m)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Draheim2017b /&gt;

Based on that,  partial conditional probability can be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
P(A|B_1 \equiv b_1 \cdots B_m \equiv b_m)
=
\underset{n \longrightarrow \infty}{lim}
P^n(A|B_1 \equiv b_1 \cdots B_m \equiv b_m),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; b_i n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;ref name=Draheim2017b /&gt;

is a special case of partial conditional probability in which the condition events must form a [[Partition of a set|partition]]:

== Example ==
Suppose that somebody secretly rolls two fair six-sided [[dice]], and we wish to compute the probability that the face-up value of the first one is 2, given the information that their sum is no greater than 5.
* Let ''D1'' be the value rolled on [[dice|die]] 1.
* Let ''D2'' be the value rolled on [[dice|die]] 2.

'''''Probability that ''D1''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2'''''

Table 1 shows the [[sample space]] of 36 combinations of rolled values of the two dice, each of which occurs probability 1/36, with the numbers displayed in the red and dark gray cells being ''D''1 + ''D''2.

''D1''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 in exactly 6 of the 36 outcomes; thus ''P''(''D1''=2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|6|36}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|6}}:

Here, in the earlier notation for the definition of conditional probability, the conditioning event ''B'' is that ''D1+D2'' ≤ 5, and the event ''A'' is ''D1'' = 2. We have &lt;math&gt;P(A|B)=\tfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}=\tfrac{3/36}{10/36}=\tfrac{3}{10},&lt;/math&gt; as seen in the table.

== Use in inference ==

In [[statistical inference]], the conditional probability is an update of the probability of an [[Event (probability theory)|event]] based on new information.&lt;ref name="Casella and Berger 2002" /&gt; Incorporating the new information can be done as follows:&lt;ref name="Allan Gut 2013" /&gt;

* Let ''A'', the event of interest, be in the [[sample space]], say (''X'',''P'').
* The occurrence of the event ''A'' knowing that event ''B'' has or will have occurred,  means the occurrence of  ''A'' as it is restricted to ''B'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;A \cap B&lt;/math&gt;.
* Without the knowledge of the occurrence of ''B'', the information about the occurrence of ''A'' would simply be ''P''(''A'')
* The probability of ''A'' knowing that event ''B'' has or will have occurred, will be the probability of &lt;math&gt;A \cap B&lt;/math&gt; relative to ''P''(''B''), the probability that ''B'' has occurred.
* This results in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P(A|B) = P(A \cap B)/P(B)&lt;/math&gt; whenever ''P''(''B'')&gt;0 and 0 otherwise.

This approach results in a probability measure that is consistent with the original probability measure and satisfies all the [[Probability axioms|Kolmogorov axioms]].  This conditional probability measure also could have resulted by assuming that the relative magnitude of the probability of ''A'' with respect to ''X'' will be preserved with respect to ''B'' (cf. [[#Formal_derivation|a Formal Derivation]] below).

The wording "evidence" or "information" is generally used in the [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian interpretation of probability]]. The conditioning event is interpreted as evidence for the conditioned event. That is, ''P''(''A'') is the probability of ''A'' before accounting for evidence ''E'', and ''P''(''A''|''E'') is the probability of ''A'' after having accounted for evidence ''E'' or after having updated ''P''(''A''). This is consistent with the frequentist interpretation, which is the first definition given above.

== Statistical independence ==
{{Main|Independence (probability theory)}}

Events ''A'' and ''B'' are defined to be [[Independence (probability theory)|statistically independent]] if

:&lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''P''(''B'') is not zero, then this is equivalent to the statement that

:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = P(A).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if ''P''(''A'') is not zero, then

:&lt;math&gt;P(B|A) = P(B)&lt;/math&gt;

is also equivalent. Although the derived forms may seem more intuitive, they are not the preferred definition as the conditional probabilities may be undefined, and the preferred definition is symmetrical in ''A'' and ''B''.

'''Independent events vs. mutually exclusive events'''

The concepts of mutually independent events and [[mutually exclusive events]] are separate and distinct.

As noted, statistical independence means

:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = P(A) \quad \text{and} \quad P(B|A) = P(B)&lt;/math&gt;

provided that the probability for the conditioning event is not zero. However, events being mutually exclusive means that

:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = 0, \quad P(B|A)=0, \quad  \text{and} \quad P(A \cap B) =0.&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, mutually exclusive events cannot be statistically independent, since knowing that one occurs gives information about the other (specifically, that it certainly does not occur).

== Common fallacies ==
:''These fallacies should not be confused with Robert K. Shope's 1978 [http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/9om/the_conditional_fallacy_in_contemporary_philosophy/ "conditional fallacy"], which deals with counterfactual examples that [[beg the question]].''

=== Assuming conditional probability is of similar size to its inverse === &lt;!-- Brief example (+ diagram?) would be nice here --&gt;
{{Main|Confusion of the inverse}}
[[File:Bayes_theorem_visualisation.svg|thumb|300px|A geometric visualisation of Bayes' theorem. In the table, the values 2, 3, 6 and 9 give the relative weights of each corresponding condition and case. The figures denote the cells of the table involved in each metric, the probability being the fraction of each figure that is shaded. This shows that P(A&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;B) P(B) = P(B&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;A) P(A) i.e. P(A&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;B) = {{sfrac|P(B&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;A) P(A)|P(B)}} . Similar reasoning can be used to show that P(Ā&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;B) = {{sfrac|P(B&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Ā) P(Ā)|P(B)}} etc.]]
In general, it cannot be assumed that ''P''(''A''|''B'')&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''P''(''B''|''A''). This can be an insidious error, even for those who are highly conversant with statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Paulos, J.A. (1988) ''Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences'', Hill and Wang. {{ISBN|0-8090-7447-8}} (p. 63 ''et seq.'')&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between ''P''(''A''|''B'') and ''P''(''B''|''A'') is given by [[Bayes' theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                                 P(B|A) &amp;= \frac{P(A|B) P(B)}{P(A)}\\
  \Leftrightarrow \frac{P(B|A)}{P(A|B)} &amp;= \frac{P(B)}{P(A)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''P''(''A''|''B'')&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''P''(''B''|''A'') only if ''P''(''B'')/''P''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1, or equivalently, ''P''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''P''(''B'').

=== Assuming marginal and conditional probabilities are of similar size === &lt;!-- Diagram might be nice here  --&gt;
In general, it cannot be assumed that ''P''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''P''(''A''|''B''). These probabilities are linked through the  [[law of total probability]]:
:&lt;math&gt;P(A) = \sum_n P(A \cap B_n) = \sum_n P(A|B_n)P(B_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

where the events &lt;math&gt;(B_n)&lt;/math&gt; form a countable [[Partition of a set|partition]] of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

This fallacy may arise through [[selection bias]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bruss, F; Der Wyatt Earp Effekt; Spektrum der Wissenschaft; March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the context of a medical claim, let ''S''{{sub|''C''}} be the event that a [[sequelae|sequela]] (chronic disease) ''S'' occurs as a consequence of circumstance (acute condition) ''C''. Let ''H'' be the event that an individual seeks medical help. Suppose that in most cases, ''C'' does not cause ''S'' so ''P''(''S''{{sub|''C''}}) is low. Suppose also that medical attention is only sought if ''S'' has occurred due to ''C''. From experience of patients, a doctor may therefore erroneously conclude that ''P''(''S''{{sub|''C''}}) is high. The actual probability observed by the doctor is ''P''(''S''{{sub|''C''}}|''H'').

=== Over- or under-weighting priors ===
Not taking prior probability into account partially or completely is called ''[[base rate neglect]]''. The reverse, insufficient adjustment from the prior probability is ''[[conservatism (Bayesian)|conservatism]].

== Formal derivation ==
Formally, ''P''(''A''|''B'') is defined as the probability of ''A'' according to a new probability function on the sample space, such that outcomes not in ''B'' have probability 0 and that it is consistent with all original [[probability measure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;George Casella and Roger L. Berger (1990), ''Statistical Inference'', Duxbury Press, {{ISBN|0-534-11958-1}} (p. 18 ''et seq.'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grinstead"&gt;[http://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf Grinstead and Snell's Introduction to Probability], p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Let Ω be a [[sample space]] with [[elementary event]]s {ω}. Suppose we are told the event ''B''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;Ω has occurred. A new probability distribution (denoted by the conditional notation) is to be assigned on {ω} to reflect this. For events in ''B'', it is reasonable to assume that the relative magnitudes of the probabilities will be preserved. For some constant scale factor α, the new distribution will therefore satisfy:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp;\text{1. }\omega \in B : P(\omega|B) = \alpha P(\omega) \\
  &amp;\text{2. }\omega \notin B : P(\omega|B) = 0 \\
  &amp;\text{3. }\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} {P(\omega|B)} = 1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting 1 and 2 into 3 to select α:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                   1 &amp;= \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} {P(\omega | B)} \\
                     &amp;= \sum_{\omega \in B} {P(\omega|B)} + \cancelto{0}{\sum_{\omega \notin B} P(\omega|B)} \\
                     &amp;= \alpha \sum_{\omega \in B} {P(\omega)} \\
                     &amp;= \alpha \cdot P(B) \\
  \Rightarrow \alpha &amp;= \frac{1}{P(B)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So the new probability distribution is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     \text{1. }\omega \in B&amp;: P(\omega|B) = \frac{P(\omega)}{P(B)} \\
  \text{2. }\omega \notin B&amp;: P(\omega| B) = 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now for a general event ''A'',

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  P(A|B) &amp;= \sum_{\omega \in A \cap B} {P(\omega | B)} + \cancelto{0}{\sum_{\omega \in A \cap B^c} P(\omega|B)} \\
         &amp;= \sum_{\omega \in A \cap B} {\frac{P(\omega)}{P(B)}} \\
         &amp;= \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5335">In [[mathematics]], the '''dimension theorem for vector spaces''' states that all [[Basis (linear algebra)|bases]] of a [[vector space]] have equally many elements. This number of elements may be finite or infinite (in the latter case, it is a [[cardinal number]]), and defines the [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]] of the vector space.

Formally, the dimension theorem for vector spaces states that

:Given a vector space {{math|''V''}}, any two bases have the same [[cardinality]].

As a basis is a [[generating set]] that is [[linearly independent]], the theorem is a consequence of the following theorem, which is also useful:

:In a vector space {{math|''V''}}, if {{mvar|G}} is a generating set, and {{mvar|I}} is a linearly independent set, then the cardinality of {{mvar|I}} is not larger than the cardinality of {{mvar|G}}.

In particular if {{math|''V''}} is [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]], then all its bases are finite and have the  same number of elements.

While the proof of the existence of a basis for any vector space in the general case requires [[Zorn's lemma]] and is in fact equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]], the uniqueness of the cardinality of the basis requires only the [[ultrafilter lemma]],&lt;ref&gt;Howard, P., [[Jean E. Rubin|Rubin, J.]]: "Consequences of the axiom of choice" - Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, vol 59 (1998) {{issn|0076-5376}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which is strictly weaker (the proof given below, however, assumes [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]], i.e., that all [[cardinal number]]s are comparable, a statement which is also equivalent to the axiom of choice). The theorem can be generalized to arbitrary [[module (mathematics)|{{math|''R''}}-modules]] for rings {{math|''R''}} having [[invariant basis number]].

In the finitely generated case the proof uses only elementary arguments of [[algebra]], and does not require the axiom of choice nor its weaker variants.

==Proof==
Let {{mvar|V}} be a vector space, {{math|{''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''i'' ∈ ''I'' }}} be a [[linearly independent]] set of elements of {{mvar|V}}, and {{math|{''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''j'' ∈ ''J'' }}} be a [[generating set]]. One has to prove that the [[cardinality]] of {{mvar|I}} is not larger than that of {{mvar|J}}.

If {{mvar|J}} is finite, this results from the [[Steinitz exchange lemma]]. (Indeed, the [[Steinitz exchange lemma]] implies every finite subset of {{mvar|I}} has cardinality not larger than that of {{mvar|J}}, hence {{mvar|I}} is finite with cardinality not larger than that of {{mvar|J}}.) If {{mvar|J}} is finite, a proof based on matrix theory is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, K., Kunze, R., "Linear Algebra", 2nd ed., 1971, Prentice-Hall. (Theorem 4 of Chapter 2).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Assume that {{math|''J''}} is infinite. If {{mvar|I}} is finite, there is nothing to prove. Thus, we may assume that {{mvar|I}} is also infinite. Let us suppose that the cardinality of {{mvar|I}} is larger than that of {{mvar|J}}.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This uses the axiom of choice.&lt;/ref&gt; We have to prove that this leads to a contradiction. 

By [[Zorn's lemma]], every linearly independent set is contained in a maximal linearly independent set {{mvar|K}}. This maximality implies that {{mvar|K}} spans {{mvar|V}} and is therefore a basis (the maximality implies that every element of {{mvar|V}} is linearly dependent from the elements of {{mvar|K}}, and therefore is a linear combination of elements of {{mvar|K}}. As the cardinality of {{mvar|K}} is greater or equal with the cardinality of {{mvar|I}}, one may replace {{mvar|I}} with {{mvar|K}}, that is, one may suppose, without loss of generality, that {{mvar|I}} is a basis. 

Thus, every {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be written as a finite sum
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle b_j = \sum_{i\in E_j} \lambda_{i,j} a_i, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E_j&lt;/math&gt; is a finite subset of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.
As {{mvar|J}} is infinite, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\bigcup_{j\in J} E_j&lt;/math&gt; has the same cardinality as {{mvar|J}}.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This uses the axiom of choice.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\bigcup_{j\in J} E_j&lt;/math&gt; has cardinality smaller than that of {{mvar|I}}. 
So there is some &lt;math&gt;i_0\in I&lt;/math&gt; which does not appear
in any &lt;math&gt;E_j&lt;/math&gt;.  The corresponding &lt;math&gt;a_{i_0}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a finite linear combination of &lt;math&gt;b_j&lt;/math&gt;'s, which in turn can be expressed as finite linear combination of &lt;math&gt; a_i&lt;/math&gt;'s, not involving &lt;math&gt;a_{i_0}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt; a_{i_0}&lt;/math&gt; is linearly dependent on the other &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;'s, which provides the desired contradiction.

==Kernel extension theorem for vector spaces==
This application of the dimension theorem is sometimes itself called the ''dimension theorem''. Let

:''T'': ''U'' → ''V''

be a [[linear transformation]]. Then

:''dim''(''range''(''T'')) + ''dim''(''kernel''(''T'')) = ''dim''(''U''),

that is, the dimension of ''U'' is equal to the dimension of the transformation's [[Range (mathematics)|range]] plus the dimension of the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]]. See [[rank–nullity theorem]] for a fuller discussion.

In [[graph theory]], a mathematical discipline, a '''factor-critical graph''' (or '''hypomatchable graph'''&lt;ref name="pe74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cp83"&gt;{{citation

(A perfect matching in a graph is a subset of its edges with the property that each of its vertices is the endpoint of exactly one of the edges in the subset.)

A matching that covers all but one vertex of a graph is called a '''near-perfect matching'''. So equivalently, a factor-critical graph is a graph in which there are near-perfect matchings that avoid every possible vertex.

==Examples==
[[File:Friendship graphs.svg|thumb|240px|Three [[friendship graph]]s, examples of non-Hamiltonian factor-critical graphs]]
[[File:Gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid.png|thumb|The [[gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid]], a [[claw-free graph|claw-free]] factor-critical graph]]
Any odd-length [[cycle graph]] is factor-critical,&lt;ref name="pe74"/&gt; as is any [[complete graph]] with an odd number of vertices.&lt;ref name="lh02"/&gt; More generally, every [[Hamiltonian cycle|Hamiltonian]] graph with an odd number of vertices is factor-critical. The [[friendship graph]]s (graphs formed by connecting a collection of triangles at a single common vertex) provide examples of graphs that are factor-critical but not Hamiltonian.

If a graph {{mvar|G}} is factor-critical, then so is the [[Mycielskian]] of {{mvar|G}}. For instance, the [[Grötzsch graph]], the Mycielskian of a five-vertex cycle-graph, is factor-critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Every [[k-vertex-connected graph|2-vertex-connected]] [[claw-free graph]] with an odd number of vertices is factor-critical. For instance, the 11-vertex graph formed by removing a vertex from the [[regular icosahedron]] (the graph of the [[gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid]]) is both 2-connected and claw-free, so it is factor-critical. This result follows directly from the more fundamental theorem that every connected claw-free graph with an even number of vertices has a perfect matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Characterizations==
Factor-critical graphs may be characterized in several different ways, other than their definition as graphs in which each vertex deletion allows for a perfect matching:
*[[Tibor Gallai]] proved that a graph is factor-critical if and only if it is [[connected graph|connected]] and, for each node {{mvar|v}} of the graph, there exists a [[maximum matching]] that does not include {{mvar|v}}. It follows from these properties that the graph must have an odd number of vertices and that every maximum matching must match all but one vertex.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

*[[László Lovász]] proved that a graph is factor-critical if and only if it has an odd [[ear decomposition]], a partition of its edges into a sequence of subgraphs, each of which is an odd-length [[path (graph theory)|path]] or [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]], with the first in the sequence being a cycle, each path in the sequence having both endpoints but no interior points on vertices in previous subgraphs, and each cycle other than the first in the sequence having exactly one vertex in previous subgraphs. For instance, the graph in the illustration may be partitioned in this way into a cycle of five edges and a path of three edges. In the case that a near-perfect matching of the factor-critical graph is also given, the ear decomposition can be chosen in such a way that each ear alternates between matched and unmatched edges.&lt;ref&gt;

Hungar.|volume=7|year=1972|pages=279–280|mr=0335371}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Combinatorial Optimization: Theory and Algorithms|volume=21|series=Algorithms and Combinatorics|first1=Bernhard H.|last1=Korte|author1-link = Bernhard Korte|first2=Jens|last2=Vygen|edition=4th|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2008|isbn=978-3-540-71843-7|contribution=10.4 Ear-Decompositions of Factor-Critical Graphs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnYwgPltSjwC&amp;pg=PA235|pages=235–241}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A graph is also factor-critical if and only if it can be reduced to a single vertex by a sequence of [[edge contraction|contractions]] of odd-length cycles. Moreover, in this characterization, it is possible to choose each cycle in the sequence so that it contains the vertex formed by the contraction of the previous cycle.&lt;ref name="pe74"&gt;{{citation

Conversely from a sequence of odd cycle contractions, each containing the vertex formed from the previous contraction, one may form an ear decomposition in which the ears are the sets of edges contracted in each step.
*Suppose that a graph {{mvar|G}} is given together with a choice of a vertex {{mvar|v}} and a matching {{mvar|M}} that covers all vertices other than {{mvar|v}}. Then {{mvar|G}} is factor-critical if and only if there is a set of paths in {{mvar|G}}, alternating between matched and unmatched edges, that connect {{mvar|v}} to each of the other vertices in {{mvar|G}}. Based on this property, it is possible to determine in [[linear time]] whether a graph {{mvar|G}} with a given near-perfect matching is factor-critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Properties==
Factor-critical graphs must always have an odd number of vertices, and must be [[k-edge-connected graph|2-edge-connected]] (that is, they cannot have any [[Bridge (graph theory)|bridges]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | pages = 183–195
 | title = Packings and perfect path double covers of maximal planar graphs
 | volume = 117
 | year = 1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are not necessarily [[k-vertex-connected graph|2-vertex-connected]]; the friendship graphs provide a counterexample. It is not possible for a factor-critical graph to be [[bipartite graph|bipartite]], because in a bipartite graph with a near-perfect matching, the only vertices that can be deleted to produce a perfectly matchable graph are the ones on the larger side of the bipartition.

Every 2-vertex-connected factor-critical graph with {{mvar|m}} edges has at least {{mvar|m}} different near-perfect matchings, and more generally every factor-critical graph with {{mvar|m}} edges and {{mvar|c}} blocks (2-vertex-connected components) has at least {{math|''m'' &amp;minus; ''c'' + 1}} different near-perfect matchings. The graphs for which these bounds are tight may be characterized by having odd ear decompositions of a specific form.&lt;ref name="lh02"&gt;{{citation

Any connected graph may be transformed into a factor-critical graph by  [[edge contraction|contracting]] sufficiently many of its edges. The [[minimal element|minimal]] sets of edges that need to be contracted to make a given graph {{mvar|G}} factor-critical form the bases of a [[matroid]], a fact that implies that a [[greedy algorithm]] may be used to find the minimum weight set of edges to contract to make a graph factor-critical, in [[polynomial time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Applications==
A '''blossom''' is  a factor-critical [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of a larger graph. Blossoms play a key role in [[Jack Edmonds]]' [[Edmonds's_matching_algorithm|algorithm]]s for [[maximum matching]] and minimum weight perfect matching in non-bipartite graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Edmonds, Jack | authorlink = Jack Edmonds | title=Paths, Trees and Flowers | journal=[[Canadian Journal of Mathematics]] | volume=17 | year=1965 | pages=449–467 | mr = 0177907 | doi=10.4153/CJM-1965-045-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[polyhedral combinatorics]], factor-critical graphs play an important role in describing facets of the [[matching polytope]] of a given graph.&lt;ref name="pe74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cp83"/&gt;

==Generalizations and related concepts==
A graph is said to be {{mvar|k}}-factor-critical if every subset of {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; ''k''}} vertices has a perfect matching. Under this definition, a hypomatchable graph is 1-factor-critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 16
 | year = 1996
 | doi=10.7151/dmgt.1022}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more generally, a graph is {{math|(''a'',''b'')}}-factor-critical if every subset of {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; ''k''}} vertices has an {{mvar|r}}-factor, that is, it is the vertex set of an [[regular graph|{{mvar|r}}-regular subgraph]] of the given graph.

A [[critical graph]] (without qualification) is usually assumed to mean a graph for which removing each of its vertices reduces the number of colors it needs in a [[graph coloring]]. The concept of criticality has been used much more generally in graph theory to refer to graphs for which removing each possible vertex changes or does not change some relevant property of the graph. A '''matching-critical graph''' is a graph for which the removal of any vertex does not change the size of a [[maximum matching]]; by Gallai's characterization, the matching-critical graphs are exactly the graphs in which every connected component is factor-critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Beyond graph theory, the concept of factor-criticality has been extended to [[matroid]]s by defining a type of ear decomposition on matroids and defining a matroid to be factor-critical if it has an ear decomposition in which all ears are odd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Biography==
After graduating from the Dresden ''[[Kreuzschule]]'', Friedrich Hultsch studied classical philology at the [[University of Leipzig]] from 1851 to 1855. After a probationary year at the ''Kreuzschule'', he was employed in 1857 as a second [[Adjunct professor|''Adjunkt'']] at the ''Alte Nikolaischule'' in Leipzig. In 1858 he became a teacher at the [[Zwickau]] ''Gymnasium''. In 1861 Hultsch was again employed at the ''Kreuzschule'', where he was the rector from 1868 until his retirement in 1889. From 1879 to 1882 he also headed the newly founded ''Wettiner Gymnasium''.

Hultsch specialized in [[historical metrology]] and [[textual criticism]] concerning mathematical antiquity.

His most important works are:
*''Griechische und römische Metrologie'' (Berlin 1862; with a substantially expanded second edition in 1882);
*the edition of ''Scriptores metrologici graeci et romani'' (Leipzig 1864–1866, 2 volumes);

In mathematics, a '''fusion category''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] that is [[rigid category|rigid]], [[semisimple category|semisimple]], [[linear category|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-linear]], [[monoidal category|monoidal]] and has only finitely many isomorphism classes of [[Glossary_of_category_theory#simple_object|simple objects]], such that the monoidal unit is simple. If the ground field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is algebraically closed, then the latter is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(1,1)\cong k&lt;/math&gt; by [[Schur's lemma]].
==Examples==

==Reconstruction==

Under [[Tannaka-Krein duality]], every fusion category arises as the representations of a [[weak Hopf algebra]].

'''Harry Lindgren''' (1912–1992) was a British/Australian engineer, linguist and amateur mathematician. He was born in [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]] in England.

In 1935 he emigrated to Australia. He received a BSc degree from the [[University of Western Australia]] and later became a Commonwealth Patent Officer.

==Contributions to mathematics==
Lindgren published articles in several mathematical journals which culminated in his famous book 'Geometric Dissections' (Van Nostrand 1964), which explores techniques for devising and solving [[dissection puzzle]]s. When published, his work was the only complete treatment of this subject in any language.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Martin Gardner]] writing in "The Unexpected Hanging" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; This remained true for a third of a century.&lt;ref&gt;See "Dissections: Plane &amp; Fancy", Greg N. Frederickson (Cambridge University Press, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to linguistics==
In 1969 Lindgren published ''Spelling Reform: A New Approach'' (Alpha Books, 104 Bathurst St, Sydney 2000, Australia). This work outlines a  proposal for introducing phoneme-by-phoneme adjustment of English spelling, in order that spellings may more accurately represent the sounds of the speech they denote. The book features several cartoons illustrating the absurdities of existing spellings.

On 1 September 1971 Lindgren launched the [[Spelling Action Society]] to promote his suggested reforms. He chose the name to share its initials with [[Scandinavian Airlines|Scandinavia's SAS airline]] to acknowledge his Nordic ancestry. He published the newsletter Spelling Action under the society to promote use of his [[SR1|Spelling Reform step One (SR1)]]. As Lindgren's health deteriorated in later life the newsletter was taken over by Gary Jimmieson (and later Doug Everingham).

'''Henry Thomas Colebrooke''' [[Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[FRSE]] (15 June 1765&amp;nbsp;– 10 March 1837) was an English [[oriental studies|orientalist]] and mathematician. He has been described as "the first great Sanskrit scholar in Europe".&lt;ref name=RSE&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf|publisher=[[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]|page=194|title=Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{Use dmy dates|date= February 2018}}
Henry Thomas Colebrooke was born on 15 June 1765. His parents were [[Sir George Colebrooke, 2nd Baronet]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Arundel (UK Parliament constituency)|Arundel]] and Chairman of the [[East India Company]] from 1769, and Mary Gaynor, daughter and heir of Patrick Gaynor of [[Antigua]]. He was educated at home.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Colebrooke, Henry Thomas (DNB00)|last= Lane-Poole|first=Stanley|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1782 Colebrooke was appointed through his father's influence to a [[East India Company#Writers|writership]] with the East a India Company in [[Calcutta]]. In 1786 and three years later he was appointed assistant collector in the revenue department at [[Tirhut]]. He wrote ''Remarks on the Husbandry and Commerce of Bengal'', which was privately publisher in 1795, by which time he had transferred to [[Purnia]]. This opposed the East India Company's monopoly on Indian trade, advocating instead for free trade between Britain and India, which caused offence to the East India Company's governors.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

He was appointed to the magistracy of [[Mirzapur]] in 1795 and was sent to [[Nagpur]] in 1799 to negotiate am allowance with the Raja of Berar. He was unsuccessful in this, due to events elsewhere, and returned in 1801.
On his return was made a judge of the new court of appeal in Calcutta, of which he became president of the bench in 1805. Also in 1805, [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Lord Wellesley]] appointed him honorary professor of [[Hindu law]] and Sanskrit at the [[East India Company College|college]] of [[Fort William, India|Fort William]]. In 1807 he became a member of council, serving for five years, and was elected President of the [[Asiatic Society of Calcutta]]. He returned to England in 1815.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1816 he was elected to the fellowship of both the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]&lt;ref name=RSE/&gt; In 1820 he was a founder of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. He often chaired the society's meetings in the absence of the first president, [[William Herschel]], and was elected as its second president on Herschel's death, serving 1823–1825. In 1823 he was also a founder of the [[Royal Asiatic Society]], chairing its first meeting although he declined to become its president.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofroyalas00dreyuoft#page/18|title=History of the Royal Astronomical Society 1820–1920|pages=11, 18–19|chapter=The Decade 1820–1830|author=[[Herbert Hall Turner]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ras.org.uk/about-the-ras/79-general/766-past-ras-presidents|title=Past RAS Presidents|publisher=Royal Astronomical Society|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|title=Report of the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, at Its First General Meeting, on the 15th of March, 1823|author=G.

==Works==
After eleven years' residence in India, Colebrooke began the study of the [[Sanskrit]] [[language]]; and to him was entrusted the translation of the major ''Digest of Hindu Laws'', a monumental study of [[Hindu law]] which had been left unfinished by [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]]. He translated the two treatises, the ''[[Mitacshara]]'' of [[Vijnaneshwara]] and the ''[[Dayabhaga]]'' of [[Jimutavahana]], under the title ''Law of Inheritance''. During his residence at Calcutta he wrote his ''Sanskrit Grammar'' (1805), some papers on the religious ceremonies of the Hindus, and his ''Essay on the [[Vedas]]'' (1805), for a long time the standard work in English on the subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1649">In mathematics, the '''Heronian mean''' ''H'' of two non-negative [[real number]]s ''A'' and ''B'' is given by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{1}{3} \left(A + \sqrt{A B} +B \right).&lt;/math&gt;

It is named after [[Hero of Alexandria]].

==Application in solid geometry==
[[File:Square frustum.png|thumb|A square frustum, with volume equal to the height times the Heronian mean of the square areas]]
The Heronian mean may be used in finding the [[volume]] of a [[frustum]] of a [[pyramid]] or [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. The volume is equal to the product of the height of the frustum and the Heronian mean of the areas of the opposing parallel faces.

==Relation to other means==
The Heronian mean of the numbers ''A'' and ''B'' is a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted mean]] of their [[arithmetic mean|arithmetic]] and [[geometric mean]]s:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3649">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hitchin integrable system''' is an [[integrable system]] depending on the choice of a complex reductive group and a compact Riemann surface, introduced by [[Nigel Hitchin]] in 1987. 
It lies on the crossroads
of [[algebraic geometry]], the theory of [[Lie algebra]]s and integrable system theory.   
It also plays an important role in [[geometric Langlands correspondence]] over the field of [[complex number]]s; related to [[two-dimensional conformal field theory|conformal field theory]]. A genus zero analogue of the Hitchin system arises as a certain limit of the [[Knizhnik&amp;ndash;Zamolodchikov equations]].  Almost all integrable systems of classical mechanics can be obtained as particular cases of the Hitchin system (or its meromorphic  generalization or in a singular limit).

The '''Hitchin fibration''' is the map from the moduli space of [[Hitchin pair]]s to characteristic polynomials. 
{{harvs|txt|last=Ngô|year1=2006|year2=2010}} used Hitchin fibrations over finite fields in his proof of the [[fundamental lemma (Langlands program)|fundamental lemma]].

==Description==

Using the language of algebraic geometry, the phase space of the system is a partial compactification of the [[cotangent bundle]] to the [[moduli space]] of stable ''G''-bundles for some [[reductive group]] ''G'', on some compact algebraic curve. This space is endowed with a canonical symplectic form. Suppose for simplicity that ''G''=GL(''n''), the [[general linear group]]; then the hamiltonians can be described as follows: the tangent space to ''G''-bundles at the bundle ''F'' is 

:&lt;math&gt;H^1(End(F)),&lt;/math&gt;

which by [[Serre duality]] is dual to 

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi \in H^0(End(F)\otimes K),&lt;/math&gt; 

so a pair 

:&lt;math&gt;(F,\Phi)&lt;/math&gt; 

called a Hitchin pair or [[Higgs bundle]], defines a point in the cotangent bundle. Taking 

:&lt;math&gt;Tr(\Phi^k)\ ,\ \ \ \ k=1,...,rank(G)&lt;/math&gt;

one obtains elements in 

:&lt;math&gt;H^0( K^{\otimes k} ),&lt;/math&gt;

which is a vector space which does not depend on &lt;math&gt;(F,\Phi)&lt;/math&gt;. So taking any basis in these vector spaces we obtain functions ''H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', which are Hitchin's hamiltonians. The construction for general reductive group is similar and uses invariant polynomials on the [[Lie algebra]] of ''G''.

For trivial reasons these functions are algebraically independent, and some calculations show that their number is exactly half of the dimension of the phase space. The nontrivial part is a proof of [[Poisson commutativity]] of these functions.

An '''independent equation''' is an [[equation]] in a [[system of linear equations|system of simultaneous equations]] which cannot be derived algebraically from the other equations. The concept typically arises in the context of [[linear equation]]s. If it is possible to duplicate one of the equations in a system by multiplying each of the other equations by some number (potentially a different number for each equation) and summing the resulting equations, then that equation is '''dependent''' on the others. But if this is not possible, then that equation is independent of the others.

If an equation is independent of the other equations in its system, then it provides information beyond that which is provided by the other equations. In contrast, if an equation is dependent on the others, then it provides no information not contained in the others collectively, and the equation can be dropped from the system without any information loss.

[[File:3 equations -1.JPG|thumb|left|A system of three linearly independent equations, ''y=x''+1, &lt;br&gt;''y''=–2''x''+1, and ''y''=3''x''–2. There are no two constants ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''a'' times the first equation plus ''b'' times the second equation equals the third equation.]]

The number of independent equations in a system equals the rank of the [[augmented matrix]] of the system&amp;mdash;the system's [[coefficient matrix]] with one additional column appended, that column being the [[column vector]] of constants.

The number of independent equations in a system of  [[consistent equations]] (a system that has at least one solution) can never be greater than the number of unknowns. Equivalently, if a system has more independent equations than unknowns, it is inconsistent and has no solutions.

'''Jean-Gaston Darboux''' [[French Academy of Sciences|FAS]] [[Institute of France|MIF]] [[Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (14 August 1842&amp;nbsp;– 23 February 1917) was a French [[mathematician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenhart| first=Luther P.|authorlink=Luther P. Eisenhart|title=Darboux's contribution to geometry|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] |year=1918|volume=24|issue=5|pages=227–237|mr=1560051|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1918-03052-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
According to [http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH060/PG/FRDAFAN83_OL0658046V041.htm his birth certificate], he was born in [[Nîmes]] in [[France]] on 14 August 1842, at 1 am. However, probably due to the midnight birth, Darboux himself usually reported his own birthday as 13 August, ''e.g.'' in [http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH060/PG/FRDAFAN83_OL0658046V032.htm his filled form for Légion d'Honneur].

His parents were François Darboux, businessman of mercery, and Alix Gourdoux. The father died when Gaston was 7. His mother undertook the mercery business with great courage, and insisted that her children receive good education. Gaston had a younger brother, Louis, who taught mathematics at the Lycée Nîmes for almost his entire life. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5703805f/f4.image.r=%22Mme%20darboux%22|title=Enfance des célébrités contemporains: Gaston Darboux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at the Nîmes Lycée and the [[Montpellier]] Lycée before being accepted at the [[École normale supérieure]] in 1861,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf|title=Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received his [[Ph.D.]] there in 1866. His thesis, written under the direction of [[Michel Chasles]], was titled ''Sur les surfaces orthogonales''. During his studies at the ENS, he also took lectures in [[Sorbonne University]] and [[Collège de France]].

[[File:Darboux as a student of the Ecole Normale.png|thumb|Darboux as a student of the Ecole Normale. ca. 1865]]

In 1870, he co-founded the journal ''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/bulletin-des-sciences-mathematiques/ Bulletin des sciences mathématiques et astronomiques]'', called "Darboux's Journal" by his contemporary mathematicians. 

In 1872, he married the Beauvaisian [[milliner]] Amélie ''Célina'' Carbonnier (1848-1911), daughter of Charles Louis Carbonnier, tailor, and Marie Victorine Anastase Hènocq. He and Célina had two children, Jean-''Gaston'' (1870-1921), who was born at the time of the [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|Siege of Paris]] and later became a marine zoologist at the Faculty of Science in Marseille, and Anaïs Berthe ''Lucie'' (1873-1970). &lt;ref&gt;Roland Brasseur – Dictionnaire des professeurs de mathématiques en classe de mathématiques spéciales – 7 mai 2015 https://pdfkul.com/darboux-rb-dico-prof-spes-20150507pdf_59d309be1723dde389357150.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He participated in the foundation of the [[École normale supérieure de jeunes filles]] in 1880, an institute that aimed at training female educators and ran parallel to the [[École normale supérieure]] on rue d'Ulm. Its first director was [[Julie Favre]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biographie de Gaston Darboux'' by Marianne Durand at Lycée Professionnel Gaston Darboux https://www.lyc-darboux-nimes.ac-montpellier.fr/l-etablissement-en-pratique/biographie-de-gaston-darboux&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Darboux was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des Sciences]]. 

Darboux made several important contributions to [[geometry]] and [[mathematical analysis]] (see, for example, [[Differential equation#Linear PDEs|linear PDEs]]). He was a [[biographer]] of [[Henri Poincaré]] and he edited the Selected Works of [[Joseph Fourier]].

Among his students were [[Émile Borel]], [[Élie Cartan]], [[Émile Picard]], [[Gheorghe Țițeica]] and [[Stanisław Zaremba (mathematician)|Stanisław Zaremba]].

Darboux's contribution to the [[differential geometry of surfaces]] appears in the four-volume collection of studies he published between 1887 and 1896; see links below for access to these texts.

In 1900, he was appointed the Academy's permanent secretary of its Mathematics section.

In 1902, he was elected to the [[Royal Society]]; in 1916, he received the [[Sylvester Medal]] from the Society.  In 1908, he was a [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|plenary speaker]] at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICM Plenary and Invited Speakers since 1897|url=http://www.mathunion.org/db/ICM/Speakers/SortedByCongress.php|publisher=[[International Congress of Mathematicians]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15556">The '''Kervaire invariant''' is an invariant of a [[parallelizable manifold|framed]] &lt;math&gt;(4k+2)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[manifold]] that measures whether the manifold could be [[surgery theory|surgically]] converted into a sphere. This invariant evaluates to 0 if the manifold can be converted to a sphere, and 1 otherwise. This invariant was named after [[Michel Kervaire]] who built on work of [[Cahit Arf]].

The Kervaire invariant is defined as the [[Arf invariant]] of the [[skew-quadratic form]] on the middle dimensional [[homology group]]. It can be thought of as the simply-connected ''quadratic'' [[L-theory|L-group]] &lt;math&gt;L_{4k+2}&lt;/math&gt;, and thus analogous to the other invariants from L-theory: the [[signature (topology)|signature]], a &lt;math&gt;4k&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional invariant (either symmetric or quadratic, &lt;math&gt;L^{4k} \cong L_{4k}&lt;/math&gt;), and the [[De Rham invariant]], a &lt;math&gt;(4k+1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional ''symmetric'' invariant &lt;math&gt;L^{4k+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

In any given dimension, there are only two possibilities: either all manifolds have Arf–Kervaire invariant equal to 0, or half have Arf–Kervaire invariant 0 and the other half have Arf–Kervaire invariant 1.

The '''Kervaire invariant problem''' is the problem of determining in which dimensions the Kervaire invariant can be nonzero. For [[differentiable manifold]]s, this can happen in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126, and in no other dimensions. The final case of dimension 126 remains open.

== Definition ==
The Kervaire invariant is the [[Arf invariant]] of the [[quadratic form]] determined by the framing on the middle-dimensional &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;-coefficient homology group

:&lt;math&gt;q\colon H_{2m+1}(M;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) \to \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;,

and is thus sometimes called the '''Arf–Kervaire invariant'''. The quadratic form (properly, [[skew-quadratic form]]) is a [[quadratic refinement]] of the usual [[ε-symmetric form]] on the middle dimensional homology of an (unframed) even-dimensional manifold; the framing yields the quadratic refinement.

The quadratic form ''q'' can be defined by algebraic topology using functional [[Steenrod square]]s, and geometrically via the self-intersections 
of [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersions]] &lt;math&gt;S^{2m+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;M^{4m+2}&lt;/math&gt; determined by the framing, or by the triviality/non-triviality of the normal bundles of embeddings &lt;math&gt;S^{2m+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;M^{4m+2}&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;m \neq 0,1,3&lt;/math&gt;) and the mod 2 [[Hopf invariant]] of maps &lt;math&gt;S^{4m+2+k} \to S^{2m+1+k}&lt;/math&gt;
(for &lt;math&gt;m = 0,1,3&lt;/math&gt;).

== History ==
The Kervaire invariant is a generalization of the Arf invariant of a framed surface (= 2-dimensional manifold with stably trivialized tangent bundle) which was used by [[Lev Pontryagin]] in 1950 to compute the [[homotopy group]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_{n+2}(S^n)=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of maps &lt;math&gt;S^{n+2}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;n\geq 2&lt;/math&gt;), which is the cobordism group of surfaces embedded in &lt;math&gt;S^{n+2}&lt;/math&gt; with trivialized normal bundle.

{{harvtxt|Kervaire|1960}} used his invariant for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10 to construct the [[Kervaire manifold]], a 10-dimensional [[PL manifold]] with no [[smooth structure|differentiable structure]], the first example of such a manifold, by showing that his invariant does not vanish on this PL manifold, but vanishes on all smooth manifolds of dimension 10.

{{harvtxt|Kervaire|Milnor|1963}} computes the group of [[exotic sphere]]s (in dimension greater than 4), with one step in the computation depending on the Kervaire invariant problem. Specifically, they show that the set of exotic spheres of dimension ''n'' – specifically the monoid of smooth structures on the standard ''n''-sphere – is isomorphic to the group &lt;math&gt;\Theta_n&lt;/math&gt; of [[H-cobordism|''h''-cobordism]] classes of oriented [[homotopy sphere|homotopy ''n''-spheres]]. They compute this latter in terms of a map
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta_n/bP_{n+1}\to \pi_n^S/J,\, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;bP_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the cyclic subgroup of ''n''-spheres that bound a [[parallelizable manifold]] of dimension &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi_n^S&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n''th [[stable homotopy group of spheres]], and ''J'' is the image of the [[J-homomorphism]], which is also a cyclic group. The groups &lt;math&gt;bP_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; have easily understood cyclic factors, which are trivial or order two except in dimension &lt;math&gt;n = 4k+3&lt;/math&gt;, in which case they are large, with order related to the [[Bernoulli number]]s. The quotients are the difficult parts of the groups. The map between these quotient groups is either an isomorphism or is injective and has an image of index 2. It is the latter if and only if there is an ''n''-dimensional framed manifold of nonzero Kervaire invariant, and thus the classification of exotic spheres depends up to a factor of 2 on the Kervaire invariant problem.

== Examples ==
For the standard embedded [[torus]], the skew-symmetric form is given by &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1\\-1 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; (with respect to the standard [[symplectic basis]]), and the skew-quadratic refinement is given by &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; with respect to this basis: &lt;math&gt;Q(1,0)=Q(0,1)=0&lt;/math&gt;: the basis curves don't self-link; and &lt;math&gt;Q(1,1)=1&lt;/math&gt;: a (1,1) self-links, as in the [[Hopf fibration]]. This form thus has [[Arf invariant]] 0 (most of its elements have norm 0; it has [[isotropy index]] 1), and thus the standard embedded torus has Kervaire invariant 0.

== Kervaire invariant problem ==
The question of in which dimensions ''n'' there are ''n''-dimensional framed manifolds of nonzero Kervaire invariant is called the '''Kervaire invariant problem'''. This is only possible if ''n'' is 2 mod 4, and indeed one must have ''n'' is 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''2'' (two less than a power of two). The question is almost completely resolved; {{as of|2012|lc=1}} only the case of dimension 126 is open: there are manifolds with nonzero Kervaire invariant in dimension 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and none in all other dimensions other than possibly 126.

The main results are those of {{harvs|txt|last=Browder|first=William|authorlink=William Browder (mathematician)|year=1969}}, who reduced the problem from differential topology to [[stable homotopy theory]] and showed that the only possible dimensions are &lt;math&gt;2^k-2&lt;/math&gt;, and those of {{harvs|txt|last1=Hill | first1=Michael A. | last2=Hopkins | first2=Michael J. |author2-link = Michael J. Hopkins | last3=Ravenel | first3=Douglas C.|autho3-link=Douglas Ravenel |year=2016}}, who showed that there were no such manifolds for &lt;math&gt;k \geq 8&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;n \geq 254&lt;/math&gt;). Together with explicit constructions for lower dimensions (through 62), this leaves open only dimension 126.

It is conjectured by [[Michael Atiyah]] that there is such a manifold in dimension 126, and that the higher-dimensional manifolds with nonzero Kervaire invariant are related to well-known exotic manifolds two dimension higher, in dimensions 16, 32, 64, and 128, namely the [[Cayley projective plane]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}P^2&lt;/math&gt; (dimension 16, octonionic projective plane) and the analogous [[Rosenfeld projective plane]]s (the bi-octonionic projective plane in dimension 32, the [[quateroctonionic projective plane]] in dimension 64, and the octo-octonionic projective plane in dimension 128), specifically that there is a construction that takes these projective planes and produces a manifold with nonzero Kervaire invariant in two dimensions lower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/101031/kervaire-invariant-why-dimension-126-especially-difficult#comment-259820 comment] by André Henriques Jul 1, 2012 at 19:26, on "[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/101031/kervaire-invariant-why-dimension-126-especially-difficult Kervaire invariant: Why dimension 126 especially difficult?]", ''[http://mathoverflow.net/ MathOverflow]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kervaire–Milnor''' invariant is a closely related invariant of framed surgery of a 2, 6 or 14-dimensional framed manifold, that gives isomorphisms from the 2nd and 6th [[stable homotopy group of spheres]] to '''Z'''/2'''Z''', 
and a homomorphism from the 14th stable homotopy group of spheres onto '''Z'''/2'''Z'''. For ''n'' = 2, 6, 14 there is an
exotic framing on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;n/2&lt;/sup&gt; x ''S''&lt;sup&gt;n/2&lt;/sup&gt; with Kervaire-Milnor invariant 1.

'''Lacunarity''', from the Latin [[wikt:lacuna|lacuna]] meaning "gap" or "lake", is a specialized term in [[geometry]] referring to a measure of how patterns, especially [[fractal]]s, fill space, where patterns having more or larger gaps generally have higher lacunarity. Beyond being an intuitive measure of gappiness, lacunarity can quantify additional features of patterns such as "rotational invariance" and more generally, heterogeneity.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Measuring lacunarity ==
In many patterns or data sets, lacunarity is not readily perceivable or quantifiable, so computer-aided methods have been developed to calculate it. As a measurable quantity, lacunarity is often denoted in scientific literature by the Greek letters &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; but it is important to note that there is no single standard and several different methods exist to assess and interpret lacunarity.

=== Box counting lacunarity ===
[[File:Fixedstack.gif|thumb|right|400px|Figure 2a. Boxes laid over an image as a fixed grid.
[[File:Slidestack.gif|thumb|right|400px|Figure 2b. Boxes slid over an image in an overlapping pattern.]]]]
One well-known method of determining lacunarity for patterns extracted from digital images uses [[box counting]], the same essential algorithm typically used for some types of [[fractal analysis]].&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"/&gt; Similar to looking at a slide through a microscope with changing levels of magnification, box counting algorithms look at a digital image from many levels of resolution to examine how certain features change with the size of the element used to inspect the image. Basically, the arrangement of pixels is measured using traditionally square (i.e., box-shaped) elements from an arbitrary set of &lt;math&gt;\Epsilon&lt;/math&gt; sizes, conventionally denoted &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;s.  For each &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, the box is placed successively over the entire image, and each time it is laid down, the number of pixels that fall within the box is recorded.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This contrasts with [[box counting]] fractal analysis where the ''total number of boxes that contained any pixels'' is counted to determine a fractal dimension.&lt;/ref&gt; In '''standard box counting''', the box for each &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is placed as though it were part of a grid overlaid on the image so that the box does not overlap itself, but in '''sliding box algorithms''' the box is slid over the image so that it overlaps itself and the "Sliding Box Lacunarity" or SLac is calculated.&lt;ref name="plotnick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wiens"/&gt; Figure 2 illustrates both types of box counting.

==== Calculations from box counting ====
The data gathered for each &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; are manipulated to calculate lacunarity. One measure, denoted here as &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, is found from the coefficient of variation (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{CV}&lt;/math&gt;), calculated as the standard deviation (&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) divided by the mean (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;), for pixels per box.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plotnick"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid-18595800/&gt; Because the way an image is sampled will depend on the arbitrary starting location, for any image sampled at any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; there will be some number (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{G}&lt;/math&gt;) of possible orientations, each denoted here by &lt;math&gt;\mathit{g}&lt;/math&gt;, that the data can be gathered over, which can have varying effects on the measured distribution of pixels.&lt;ref name="Karperien"&gt;{{cite book|title=Defining Microglial Morphology: Form, Function, and Fractal Dimension|author=Karperien|year=2004|publisher=Charles Sturt University |chapter=Chapter 8 Multifractality and Lacunarity|url=http://bilby.unilinc.edu.au/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;amp;object_id=31797&amp;amp;silo_library=GEN01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fraclac/FLHelp/BoxCounting.htm#gridlocation for an explanation of methods to address variation with grid location&lt;/ref&gt; Equation {{EquationNote|1}} shows the basic method of calculating &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}&lt;/math&gt;:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon,g} = (CV_{\varepsilon,g})^2 = \left( \frac  {\sigma_{\varepsilon,g}}   {\mu_{\varepsilon,g}}  \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

===== Probability distributions =====
Alternatively, some methods sort the numbers of pixels counted into a probability distribution having &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; bins, and use the bin sizes (masses, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;) and their corresponding probabilities (&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;) to calculate &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}&lt;/math&gt; according to Equations {{EquationNote|2}} through {{EquationNote|5}}: 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\varepsilon}=\sum_{i=1}^{B} {m_{i,\varepsilon} p_{i,\varepsilon}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathit{v}_{\varepsilon}=\sum_{i-1}^{B} {\left( m_{i,\varepsilon} - \mu_{\varepsilon} \right ) ^2 p_{i,\varepsilon}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\varepsilon}=\sqrt{\mathit{v}_{\varepsilon}}=\sum_{i=1}^{B} {m_{i,\varepsilon}^2 p_{i,\varepsilon}-\mu_{\varepsilon}^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{B} {m_{i,\varepsilon}^2 p_{i,\varepsilon}-\mu_{\varepsilon}^2}}{\mu_{\varepsilon}^2} = \frac{\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2}{\mu_{\varepsilon}^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

==== Interpreting &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; ====
Lacunarity based on &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}&lt;/math&gt; has been assessed in several ways including by using the variation in or the average value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; (see Equation {{EquationNote|6}}) and by using the variation in or average over all grids (see Equation {{EquationNote|7}}).&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karperien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wiens"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McIntyre | first1 = N. E. | last2 = Wiens | first2 = J.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\overline{\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}}=\frac{\sum_{\varepsilon=1}^\Epsilon \lambda_{\varepsilon,g}}{\Epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{\mathit{g}}=\frac{\sum_{\mathit{g}=1}^\mathit{G} \overline{\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}}}{\mathit{G}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

===== Relationship to the fractal dimension =====
Lacunarity analyses using the types of values discussed above have shown that data sets extracted from dense fractals, from patterns that change little when rotated, or from patterns that are homogeneous, have low lacunarity, but as these features increase,{{clarify|What increases lacunarity, repetition of low-lac. pattern, or another feature?|date=October 2012}} so generally does lacunarity. In some instances, it has been demonstrated that fractal dimensions and values of lacunarity were correlated,&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; but more recent research has shown that this relationship does not hold for all types of patterns and measures of lacunarity.&lt;ref name="Karperien"/&gt; Indeed, as Mandelbrot originally proposed, lacunarity has been shown to be useful in discerning amongst patterns (e.g., fractals, textures, etc.) that share or have similar [[fractal dimension]]s in a variety of scientific fields including neuroscience.&lt;ref name="Jelinek"&gt;{{cite book|title=8th European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology, Kraków |first1=Herbert |last1=Jelinek |first2=Audrey |last2=Karperien |first3=Nebojsa |last3=Milosevic |chapter= Lacunarity Analysis and Classification of Microglia in Neuroscience|date=June 2011|url=http://www.impan.pl/~ecmtb11/showabstract.php?id=Jelinek_Herbert1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Graphical lacunarity ====
Other methods of assessing lacunarity from box counting data use the relationship between values of lacunarity (e.g., &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; in different ways from the ones noted above. One such method looks at the &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; vs &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; plot of these values. According to this method, the curve itself can be analyzed visually, or the slope at &lt;math&gt;\mathit{g}&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated from the &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; vs &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; regression line.&lt;ref name="plotnick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wiens"/&gt; Because they tend to behave in certain ways for respectively mono-, multi-, and non-fractal patterns, &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; vs &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; lacunarity plots have been used to supplement methods of classifying such patterns.&lt;ref name="Karperien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jelinek"/&gt;

To make the plots for this type of analysis, the data from box counting first have to be transformed as in Equation {{EquationNote|9}}:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;f \lambda_{\varepsilon,g}=\lambda_{\varepsilon,g}+1&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}
This transformation avoids undefined values, which is important because homogeneous images will have &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; at some &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; equal to 0 so that the slope of the &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; vs &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; regression line would be impossible to find. With &lt;math&gt;f \lambda_{\varepsilon,g}&lt;/math&gt;, homogeneous images have a slope of 0, corresponding intuitively to the idea of no rotational or translational invariance and no gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karperien|title=Interpreting Lacunarity |year=2002|url=http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fraclac/FLHelp/lactutorial.htm#oneplus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One box counting technique using a "gliding" box calculates lacunarity according to: 
{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{L}(r) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{r^2} S_i^2 Q(S_i,r)}{ \left( \sum_{i=1}^{r^2}  S_i Q(S_i,r) \right)^2 }.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}
&lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of filled data points in the box and &lt;math&gt;Q(S_i,r)&lt;/math&gt; the normalized frequency distribution of &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; for different box sizes.

==== Prefactor lacunarity ====
Another proposed way of assessing lacunarity using box counting, the ''Prefactor'' method, is based on the value obtained from box counting for the fractal dimension (&lt;math&gt;D_B&lt;/math&gt;). This statistic uses the variable &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; from the scaling rule &lt;math&gt;N = A \varepsilon^{D_B}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is calculated from the y-intercept (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{y}&lt;/math&gt;) of the ln-ln regression line for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and either the count (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) of boxes that had any pixels at all in them or else &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is particularly affected by image size and the way data are gathered, especially by the lower limit of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;s used. The final measure is calculated as shown in Equations {{EquationNote|11}} through {{EquationNote|13}}:&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"/&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;A_g = \frac{1}{e^{\mathit{y}_g}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\overline{A} = \frac{\sum_{g=1}^G A_g}{G} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''Lebesgue constants''' (depending on a set of nodes and of its size) give an idea of how good the [[interpolation|interpolant]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] (at the given nodes) is in comparison with the best [[polynomial]] [[approximation]] of the function (the degree of the polynomials are obviously fixed).  The Lebesgue constant for polynomials of degree at most {{mvar|n}} and for the set of {{math|''n'' + 1}} nodes {{mvar|T}} is generally denoted by {{math|Λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&amp;thinsp;)}}.  These constants are named after [[Henri Lebesgue]].

==Definition==
We fix the interpolation nodes ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'', ''b''] containing all the interpolation nodes. The process of interpolation maps the function ''f'' to a polynomial ''p''. This defines a mapping ''X'' from the space ''C''([''a'', ''b'']) of all continuous functions on [''a'', ''b''] to itself. The map ''X'' is linear and it is a [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] on the subspace {{math|Π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of polynomials of degree {{mvar|n}} or less.

The Lebesgue constant {{math|Λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&amp;thinsp;)}} is defined as the [[operator norm]] of ''X''. This definition requires us to specify a norm on ''C''([''a'', ''b'']).  The [[maximum norm]] is usually the most convenient.

==Properties==
The Lebesgue constant bounds the interpolation error: let {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the best approximation of ''f'' among the polynomials of degree {{mvar|n}} or less. In other words, {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} minimizes {{math|{{!!}}&amp;thinsp;''p'' − &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;{{!!}}}} among all ''p'' in Π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt; \|f-X(f)\| \le (\Lambda_n(T)+1) \left \|f-p^* \right \|. &lt;/math&gt;

We will here prove this statement with the maximum norm.

:&lt;math&gt; \| f-X(f) \| \le \| f-p^* \| + \| p^* - X(f) \|&lt;/math&gt;

by the [[triangle inequality]]. But ''X'' is a projection on Π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, so

:{{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; − ''X''(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;) {{=}} ''X''(''p''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;) − ''X''(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;) {{=}} ''X''(''p''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; − ''f''&amp;thinsp;)}}.

This finishes the proof since &lt;math&gt;\|X(p^*-f)\| \le \|X\| \|p^*-f\|=\|X\| \|f-p^*\|&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that this relation comes also as a special case of [[Lebesgue's lemma]].

In other words, the interpolation polynomial is at most a factor {{math|Λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&amp;thinsp;) + 1}} worse than the best possible approximation. This suggests that we look for a set of interpolation nodes with a small Lebesgue constant.

The Lebesgue constant can be expressed in terms of the [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange basis]] polynomials:

:&lt;math&gt;l_j(x) := \prod_{\begin{smallmatrix}i=0\\ j\neq i\end{smallmatrix}}^{n} \frac{x-x_i}{x_j-x_i}. &lt;/math&gt;

In fact, we have the Lebesgue function

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_n(x) = \sum_{j=0}^n |l_j(x)|. &lt;/math&gt;

and the Lebesgue constant (or Lebesgue number) for the grid is its maximum value

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_n(T)=\max_{x\in[a,b]} \lambda_n(x) &lt;/math&gt;

Nevertheless, it is not easy to find an explicit expression for {{math|Λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&amp;thinsp;)}}.

==Minimal Lebesgue constants==
In the case of equidistant nodes, the Lebesgue constant [[exponential growth|grows exponentially]]. More precisely, we have the following asymptotic estimate

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda_n(T) \sim \frac{2^{n+1}}{e \, n \log n} \qquad \text{ as } n \to \infty. &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, the Lebesgue constant grows only logarithmically if [[Chebyshev nodes]] are used, since we have

:&lt;math&gt; \tfrac{2}{\pi} \log(n+1)+a &lt; \Lambda_n(T) &lt; \tfrac{2}{\pi} \log(n+1) + 1, \qquad a = 0.9625\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

We conclude again that Chebyshev nodes are a very good choice for polynomial interpolation.  However, there is an easy (linear) transformation of Chebyshev nodes that gives a better Lebesgue constant.  Let {{math|''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} denote the {{mvar|i}}-th Chebyshev node.  Then, define

:&lt;math&gt; s_i = \frac{t_i}{\cos \left ( \frac{\pi}{2(n+1)} \right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

For such nodes:

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_n(S)&lt;\tfrac{2}{\pi} \log(n+1)+b, \qquad b = 0.7219\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

Those nodes are, however, not optimal (i.e. they do not minimize the Lebesgue constants) and the search for an optimal set of nodes (which has already been proved to be unique under some assumptions) is still an intriguing topic in mathematics today.  However, this set of nodes is optimal for interpolation over &lt;math&gt; C_M^n[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt; the set of {{mvar|n}} times differentiable functions whose {{mvar|n}}-th derivatives are bounded in absolute values by a constant {{mvar|M}} as shown by N. S. Hoang. 
Using a [[computer]], one can approximate the values of the minimal Lebesgue constants, here for the canonical interval {{math|[−1, 1]}}:

:{| class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:center"
! {{mvar|n}}
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9
|-
! Λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')
| 1.0000 || 1.2500 || 1.4229 || 1.5595 || 1.6722 || 1.7681  || 1.8516 || 1.9255 || 1.9917 
|}

There are uncountable infinitely many sets of nodes in [-1,1] that minimize, for fixed {{mvar|n}} &gt; 1, the Lebesgue constant.  Though if we assume that we always take −1 and 1 as nodes for interpolation (which is called a ''canonical'' node configuration), then such a set is unique and zero-symmetric.  To illustrate this property, we shall see what happens when ''n'' = 2 (i.e. we consider 3 interpolation nodes in which case the property is not trivial).  One can check that each set of (zero-symmetric) nodes of type {{math|(−''a'', 0, ''a'')}} is optimal when {{math|{{sfrac|{{radic|8}}|3}} ≤ ''a'' ≤ 1}} (we consider only nodes in [−1, 1]).  If we force the set of nodes to be of the type {{math|(−1, ''b'', 1)}}, then ''b'' must equal 0 (look at the Lebesgue function, whose maximum is the Lebesgue constant).  All ''arbitrary'' (i.e. zero-symmetric or zero-asymmetric) optimal sets of nodes in [-1,1] when ''n'' = 2 have been determined by F. Schurer, and in an alternative fashion by H.-J. Rack and R. Vajda (2014).

If we assume that we take −1 and 1 as nodes for interpolation, then as shown by H.-J. Rack (1984 and 2013), for the case ''n'' = 3, the explicit values of the optimal (unique and zero-symmetric) 4 interpolation nodes and the explicit value of the minimal Lebesgue constant are known. All ''arbitrary'' optimal sets of 4 interpolation nodes in [-1,1] when ''n'' = 3 have been explicitly determined, in two different but equivalent fashions, by H.-J. Rack and R. Vajda (2015).

The [[Padua points]] provide another set of nodes with slow growth (although not as slow as the Chebyshev nodes) and with the additional property of being a [[unisolvent point set]].

==Sensitivity of the values of a polynomial==
The Lebesgue constants also arise in another problem.  Let ''p''(''x'') be a polynomial of degree {{mvar|n}} expressed in the [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrangian form]] associated with the points in the vector ''t'' (i.e. the vector ''u'' of its coefficients is the vector containing the values &lt;math&gt;p(t_i)&lt;/math&gt;).  Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial obtained by slightly changing the coefficients ''u'' of the original polynomial ''p''(''x'') to &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let us consider the inequality:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\|p-\hat{p}\|}{\|p\|}\leq \Lambda_n(T)\frac{\|u-\hat{u}\|}{\|u\|}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the (relative) error in the values of &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}(x)&lt;/math&gt; will not be higher than the appropriate Lebesgue constant times the relative error in the coefficients. In this sense, the Lebesgue constant can be viewed as the relative [[condition number]] of the operator mapping each coefficient vector ''u'' to the set of the values of the polynomial with coefficients ''u'' in the Lagrange form.  We can actually define such an operator for each polynomial basis but its condition number is greater than the optimal Lebesgue constant for most convenient bases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11147">In the mathematical theory of [[linear algebraic group|linear algebraic groups]], a '''[[Tits index]]''' (or '''index''') is an object used to classify semisimple [[algebraic group]]s defined over a base field ''k'', not assumed to be [[algebraically closed]]. The possible irreducible indices were classified by [[Jacques Tits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Tits|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and this classification is reproduced below. (Because every index is a direct sum of irreducible indices, classifying ''all'' indices amounts to classifying irreducible indices.)

==Organization of the list==
An index can be represented as a [[Dynkin diagram]] with certain vertices drawn close to each other (the orbit of the vertices under the *-action of the Galois group of ''k'') and with certain sets of vertices circled (the orbits of the non-distinguished vertices under the *-action). This representation captures the full information of the index except when the underlying Dynkin diagram is D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, in which case one must distinguish between an action by the [[cyclic group]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or the [[permutation group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Alternatively, an index can be represented using the name of the underlying Dykin diagram together with additional superscripts and subscripts, to be explained momentarily. This representation, together with the labeled Dynkin diagram described in the previous paragraph,  captures the full information of the index.

The notation for an index is of the form &lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;''X''{{su|p=''t''|b=''n'',''r''}}, where
* ''X'' is the letter of the underlying Dynkin diagram (A, B, C, D, E, F, or G),
* ''n'' is the number of vertices of the Dynkin diagram,
* ''r'' is the '''relative rank''' of the corresponding algebraic group,
* ''g'' is the order of the quotient of the absolute Galois group that acts [[Group action#Faithful|faithfully]] on the Dynkin diagram (so ''g'' = 1, 2, 3, or 6), and
* ''t'' is either
** the degree of a certain [[division algebra]] (that is, the square root of its dimension) arising in the construction of the algebraic group when the group is of classical type (A, B, C, or D), in which case ''t'' is written in parentheses, or
** the dimension of the anisotropic kernel of the algebraic group when the group is of exceptional type (E, F, or G), in which case ''t'' is written without parentheses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40808">In [[mathematics]], a '''mock modular form''' is the [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] part of a harmonic weak [[Maass wave form|Maass form]], and a '''mock theta function''' is essentially a mock modular form of weight 1/2. The first examples of mock theta functions were described by [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] in his last 1920 letter to [[G. H. Hardy]] and in his [[Ramanujan's lost notebook|lost notebook]].  {{harvs|txt|first=Sander|last= Zwegers|authorlink=Sander Zwegers|year1=2001|year2=2002}} discovered that adding  certain non-holomorphic functions to them turns them into harmonic weak Maass forms.

==History==
{{quote box

|width=33%
|quote="Suppose there is a function in the Eulerian form and suppose that all or an infinity of points are exponential singularities, and also suppose that at these points the asymptotic form closes as neatly as in the cases of (A) and (B). The question is: Is the function taken the sum of two functions one of which is an ordinary &amp;theta;-function and the other a (trivial) function which is O(1) at ''all'' the points ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''m''&amp;pi;''i''/''n''&lt;/sup&gt;? ... When it is not so, I call the function a Mock &amp;theta;-function."
|source=Ramanujan's original definition of a mock theta function, from {{harv|Ramanujan|2000|loc=Appendix II}}
}}
Ramanujan's 12 January 1920 letter to Hardy, reprinted in {{harv|Ramanujan|2000|loc=Appendix II}}, listed 17 examples of functions that he called mock theta functions, and his [[lost notebook]] {{harv|Ramanujan|1988}} contained several more examples. (Ramanujan used the term "theta function" for what today would be called a modular form.) Ramanujan pointed out that they have an [[asymptotic expansion]] at the cusps, similar to that of modular forms of weight 1/2, possibly with poles at cusps, but cannot be expressed in terms of "ordinary" [[theta function]]s. He called functions with similar properties "mock theta functions". Zwegers later discovered the connection of the mock theta function with weak Maass forms.

Ramanujan associated an '''order''' to his mock theta functions, which was not clearly defined. Before the work of Zwegers, the orders of known mock theta functions included
:3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10.

Ramanujan's notion of order later turned out to correspond to the [[conductor of a Dirichlet character|conductor]] of the [[Nebentypus character]] of the weight {{frac|1|2}} harmonic Maass forms which admit Ramanujan's mock theta functions as their holomorphic projections.

In the next few decades, Ramanujan's mock theta functions were studied by Watson, Andrews, Selberg, Hickerson, Choi, McIntosh, and others, who proved Ramanujan's statements about them and found several more examples and identities. (Most of the "new" identities and examples were already known to Ramanujan and reappeared in his lost notebook.) {{harvtxt|Watson|1936}} found that under the action of elements of the [[modular group]], the order 3 mock theta functions almost transform like [[modular form]]s of weight 1/2 (multiplied by suitable powers of ''q''), except that there are "error terms" in the functional equations, usually given as explicit integrals. However for many years there was no good definition of a mock theta function. This changed in 2001 when Zwegers discovered the relation with non-holomorphic modular forms, Lerch sums, and indefinite theta series. {{harvtxt|Zwegers|2002}} showed, using the previous work of Watson and Andrews, that the mock theta functions of orders 3, 5, and 7 can be written as the sum of a weak Maass form of weight {{frac|1|2}} and a function that is bounded along [[geodesic]]s ending at cusps. The weak Maass form has [[eigenvalue]] 3/16 under the [[hyperbolic Laplacian]] (the same value as holomorphic modular forms of weight {{frac|1|2}}); however, it increases exponentially fast near cusps, so it does not satisfy the usual growth condition for [[Maass wave form]]s. Zwegers proved this result in three different ways, by relating the mock theta functions to Hecke's theta functions of indefinite lattices of dimension 2, and to Appell–Lerch sums, and to meromorphic Jacobi forms.

Zwegers's fundamental result shows that mock theta functions are the "holomorphic parts" of real analytic modular forms of weight 1/2. This allows one to extend many results about modular forms to mock theta functions. In particular, like modular forms, mock theta functions all lie in certain explicit finite-dimensional spaces, which reduces the long and hard proofs of many identities between them to routine linear algebra. For the first time it became possible to produce infinite number of examples of mock theta functions; before this work there were only about 50 examples known (most of which were first found by Ramanujan). As further applications of Zwegers's ideas, [[Kathrin Bringmann]] and [[Ken Ono]] showed that certain q-series arising from the Rogers–Fine basic hypergeometric series are related to holomorphic parts of weight 3/2 harmonic weak Maass forms {{harv|Bringmann|Folsom|Ono|2009}} and showed that the asymptotic series for coefficients of the order 3 mock theta function ''f''(''q'') studied by {{harv|Andrews|1966}} and {{harvtxt|Dragonette|1952}} converges to the coefficients {{harv|Bringmann|Ono|2006}}. In particular Mock theta functions have [[asymptotic expansion]]s at [[cusp form|cusps]] of the [[modular group]], acting on the [[upper half-plane]], that resemble those of [[modular form]]s of weight 1/2 with poles at the cusps.

==Definition==
A mock modular form will be defined as the "holomorphic part" of a [[harmonic Maass form|harmonic weak Maass form]].

Fix a weight ''k'', usually with 2''k'' integral. 
Fix a subgroup Γ of [[special linear group|SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''Z'')]] (or of the [[metaplectic group]] if ''k'' is half-integral) and a character ρ of Γ. A modular form ''f''  for this character and this group Γ transforms under elements of Γ by

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(\frac{a\tau + b}{c\tau + d}\right) = \rho{
  \begin{pmatrix}
    a &amp; b  \\
    c &amp; d 
  \end{pmatrix}
}(c\tau + d)^kf(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;

A '''[[harmonic Maass form|weak Maass form]]''' of weight ''k'' is a continuous function on the upper half plane that transforms like a modular form of weight 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' and is an eigenfunction of the weight ''k'' Laplacian operator, and is called '''harmonic''' if its eigenvalue is (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''/2)''k''/2 {{harv|Bruinier|Funke|2004}}. This is the eigenvalue of holomorphic weight ''k'' modular forms, so these are all examples of harmonic weak Maass forms. (A [[Maass form]] is a weak Maass form that decreases rapidly at cusps.)
So a harmonic weak Maass form is annihilated by the differential operator

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}y^k\frac{\partial}{\partial \overline\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''F'' is any harmonic weak Maass form then the function ''g'' given by

:&lt;math&gt;g = y^k\frac{\partial \overline{F}}{\partial \tau} = \sum_n b_nq^n&lt;/math&gt;

is holomorphic and transforms like a modular form of weight ''k'', though it may not be holomorphic at cusps. If we can find any other function ''g''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; with the same image ''g'', then ''F''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''g''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; will be holomorphic. Such a function is given by inverting the differential operator by integration; for example we can define
:&lt;math&gt;g^*(\tau) = \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^{k - 1} \int_{-\overline\tau}^{i\infty} (z+\tau)^{-k}\overline{g(-\overline z)}\,dz= \sum_nn^{k - 1}\overline {b_n}\beta_k(4ny)q^{-n + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \beta_k(t) = \int_t^\infty u^{-k} e^{-\pi u} \,du&lt;/math&gt;

is essentially the [[incomplete gamma function]].
The integral converges whenever ''g'' has a zero at the cusp ''i''∞, and the incomplete gamma function can be extended by analytic continuation, so this formula can be used to define the holomorphic part ''g''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of ''F'' even in the case when ''g'' is meromorphic at ''i''∞, though this requires some care if ''k'' is 1 or not integral or if ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The inverse of the differential operator is far from unique as we can add any homomorphic function to ''g''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; without affecting its image, and as a result the function ''g''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; need not be invariant under the group Γ. The function   ''h'' = ''F''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''g''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is called the '''holomorphic part''' of ''F''.

A '''mock modular form'''  is defined to be the holomorphic part ''h'' of some harmonic weak Maass form ''F''. So there is an isomorphism from the space of  mock modular forms  ''h'' to  a subspace of the harmonic weak Maass forms.

The mock modular form ''h'' is holomorphic but not quite modular, while ''h''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''g''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is modular but not quite holomorphic. The space of mock modular forms of weight ''k'' contains the space of nearly modular forms ("modular forms that may be meromorphic at cusps") of weight ''k'' as a subspace. The quotient is (antilinearly) isomorphic to the space of holomorphic modular forms of weight 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''. The weight-(2&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'') modular form ''g'' corresponding to a mock modular form ''h'' is called its '''shadow'''. It is quite common for different mock theta functions to have the same shadow. For example, the 10 mock theta functions of order 5 found by Ramanujan fall into two groups of 5, where all the functions in each group have the same shadow (up to multiplication by a constant).

{{harvtxt|Zagier|2007}} defines a '''mock theta function''' as a rational power of ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;2π''i''τ&lt;/sup&gt; times a mock modular form of weight 1/2 whose shadow is 
a theta series of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n\in Z}\varepsilon(n)nq^{\kappa n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

for a positive rational κ and an odd periodic function ''&amp;epsilon;''. (Any such theta series is a modular form of weight 3/2). The rational power of ''q'' is a historical accident.

Most mock modular forms and weak Maass forms have rapid growth at cusps. It is common to impose the condition that they grow at most exponentially fast at cusps (which for mock modular forms means they are "meromorphic" at cusps).  The space of mock modular forms (of given weight and group) whose  growth is bounded by some fixed exponential function at cusps is finite-dimensional.

==Appell–Lerch sums==
Appell–Lerch sums, a generalization of [[Lambert series]], were first studied by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Paul Émile Appell|first=Paul Émile |last=Appell|year=1884}} and {{harvs|txt|first=Mathias|last=Lerch|authorlink=Mathias Lerch|year=1892}}. Watson studied the order 3 mock theta functions by expressing them in terms of Appell&amp;ndash;Lerch sums, and Zwegers used them to show that mock theta functions are essentially mock modular forms.

The Appell–Lerch series is
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(u, v; \tau) = \frac{a^\frac{1}{2}}{\theta(v; \tau)}\sum_{n\in Z}\frac{(-b)^nq^{\frac{1}{2}n(n + 1)}}{1 - aq^n}&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle q = e^{2\pi i \tau},\quad a = e^{2\pi i u},\quad b = e^{2\pi i v}&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;\theta(v,\tau) = \sum_{n\in Z}(-1)^n b^{n + \frac{1}{2}}q^{\frac{1}{2}\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The modified series
:&lt;math&gt;\hat\mu(u, v; \tau) = \mu(u, v; \tau) - \frac{1}{2}R(u - v; \tau)&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt;R(z;\tau) = \sum_{\nu\in Z + \frac{1}{2}}(-1)^{\nu - \frac{1}{2}}\left({\rm sign}(\nu) - E\left[\left(\nu + \frac{\Im(z)}{y}\right)\sqrt{2y}\right]\right)e^{-2\pi i \nu z}q^{-\frac{1}{2}\nu^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and ''y'' = Im(τ) and
:&lt;math&gt;E(z) = 2\int_0^ze^{-\pi u^2}\,du&lt;/math&gt;

satisfies the following transformation properties

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                      \hat\mu(u + 1, v; \tau) &amp;= a^{-1}bq^{-\frac{1}{2}}\hat\mu(u + \tau, v; \tau) \\
                                              &amp; {} = -\hat\mu(u, v; \tau) \\
  e^{\frac{2}{8}\pi i}\hat\mu(u, v; \tau + 1) &amp;= \hat\mu(u,v;\tau) \\
                                              &amp; {} = -\left(\frac{\tau}{i}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}e^{\frac{\pi i}{\tau} (u - v)^2}\hat\mu\left(\frac{u}{\tau},\frac{v}{\tau};-\frac{1}{\tau}\right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words the modified Appell&amp;ndash;Lerch series transforms like a modular form with respect to τ. Since mock theta functions can be expressed in terms of Appell&amp;ndash;Lerch series this means that mock theta functions transform like modular forms if they have a certain non-analytic series added to them.

==Indefinite theta series==
{{harvtxt|Andrews|1986}} showed that several of Ramanujan’s fifth order mock theta functions are equal to quotients Θ(τ)/θ(τ) where θ(τ) is a modular form  of weight 1/2 and Θ(τ) is a theta function of an '''indefinite'''  binary quadratic form, and {{harvtxt|Hickerson|1988b}} proved similar results for seventh order mock theta functions. Zwegers showed how to complete the indefinite theta functions to produce real analytic modular forms, and used this to give another proof of the relation between mock theta functions and weak Maass wave forms.

==Meromorphic Jacobi forms==
{{harvtxt|Andrews|1988}} observed that some of Ramanujan's fifth order mock theta functions could be expressed in terms of  quotients of Jacobi's theta functions. Zwegers used this idea to express mock theta functions as Fourier coefficients of meromorphic Jacobi forms.

==Applications==
*{{harvtxt|Lawrence|Zagier|1999}} related mock theta functions to [[quantum invariant]]s of 3-manifolds.
*{{harvtxt|Semikhatov|Taormina|Tipunin|2005}} related mock theta functions to infinite-dimensional [[Lie superalgebra]]s and [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]].
*{{harvtxt|Troost|2010}} showed that the modular completions of mock modular forms arise as elliptic genera of conformal field theories with continuous spectrum.
*Mock theta functions appear in the theory of [[umbral moonshine]].
*{{harvs|txt | last2=Murthy | first2=Sameer | last1=Dabholkar | first1=Atish | last3=Zagier | first3=Don | title=Quantum Black Holes, Wall Crossing, and Mock Modular Forms |arxiv=1208.4074 | year=2012}} showed that mock modular forms are related to the degeneracies of quantum black holes in ''N''=4 string theories.

==Examples==
*Any modular form of weight ''k'' (possibly only meromorphic at cusps) is a mock modular form of weight ''k'' with shadow 0.
*The quasimodular Eisenstein series
::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle E_2(\tau) = 1-24\sum_{n&gt;0}\sigma_1(n)q^n&lt;/math&gt;
:of weight 2 and level 1 is a mock modular form of weight 2, with shadow  a constant. This means that
::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle E_2(\tau) -3/\pi y&lt;/math&gt;
:transforms like a modular form of weight 2 (where &amp;tau; = ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''iy'').

*The function  studied by {{harvtxt|Zagier|1975}} {{harv|Hirzebruch|Zagier|1976|loc=2.2}} with Fourier coefficients that are Hurwitz class numbers ''H''(''N'') of imaginary quadratic fields is a mock modular form of weight 3/2, level 4 and shadow ∑ ''q''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The corresponding weak Maass wave form is
::&lt;math&gt;F(\tau) = \sum_NH(N)q^n + y^{-1/2}\sum_{n\in Z}\beta(4\pi n^2y)q^{-n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\beta(x) = \frac{1}{16\pi}\int_1^\infty u^{-3/2}e^{-xu}du&lt;/math&gt;
:and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Im(&amp;tau;), ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;pi;i&amp;tau;&lt;/sup&gt;.

Mock theta functions are mock modular forms of weight 1/2 whose shadow is a unary theta function, multiplied by a rational power of ''q'' (for historical reasons). Before the work of Zwegers led to a general method for constructing them, most examples were given as  [[basic hypergeometric function]]s, but this is largely a historical accident, and most mock theta functions have no known simple expression in terms of such functions.

The "trivial" mock theta functions are the (holomorphic) modular forms of weight 1/2, which were classified by {{harvtxt|Serre|Stark|1977}}, who showed that they could all be written in terms of theta functions of 1-dimensional lattices.

The following examples use the [[q-Pochhammer symbol]]s &lt;math&gt;(a;q)_n&lt;/math&gt; which are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;(a;q)_n = \prod_{0\le j&lt;n}(1-aq^j) = (1-a)(1-aq)\cdots(1-aq^{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

===Order 2===
Some order 2 mock theta functions were studied by {{harv|McIntosh|2007}}.
:&lt;math&gt;A(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{q^{(n+1)^2}(-q;q^2)_n}{(q;q^2)^2_{n+1}} = \sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{q^{n+1}(-q^2;q^2)_n}{(q;q^2)_{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A006304}}
:&lt;math&gt;B(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{q^{n(n+1)}(-q^2;q^2)_n}{(q;q^2)^2_{n+1}} = \sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{q^{n}(-q;q^2)_n}{(q;q^2)_{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A153140}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{(-1)^nq^{n^2}(q;q^2)_n}{(-q^2;q^2)^2_{n}} &lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A006306}}

The function μ was found by Ramanujan in his lost notebook.

These are related to the functions listed in the section on order 8 functions by
:&lt;math&gt; U_0(q) - 2U_1(q) = \mu(q)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V_0(q) - V_0(-q) = 4qB(q^2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V_1(q) + V_1(-q) = 2A(q^2)&lt;/math&gt;

===Order 3===
Ramanujan mentioned four order-3 mock theta functions in his letter to Hardy, and listed a further three in his lost notebook, which were rediscovered by [[G. N. Watson]]. {{harvtxt|Watson|1936}} proved the relations between them stated by Ramanujan and also found their transformations under elements of the modular group by expressing them as Appell–Lerch sums. {{harvtxt|Dragonette|1952}} described the asymptotic expansion  of their coefficients. {{harvtxt|Zwegers|2000}} related them to harmonic weak Maass forms.  See also {{harv|Fine|1988}}

The seven order-3 mock theta functions given by Ramanujan are

:&lt;math&gt;
f(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{n^2}\over (-q; q)_n^2}  = {2\over \prod_{n&gt;0}(1-q^n)}\sum_{n\in \mathbf{Z}}{(-1)^nq^{n(3n+1)/2}\over 1+q^n}
&lt;/math&gt;,  {{OEIS|id=A000025}}.

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{n^2}\over (-q^2;q^2)_n} = {1\over \prod_{n&gt;0}(1-q^n)}\sum_{n\in \mathbf{Z}}{(-1)^n(1+q^n)q^{n(3n+1)/2}\over 1+q^{2n}}
&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A053250}}.

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(q) = \sum_{n &gt; 0} {q^{n^2}\over (q;q^2)_n} = {q\over \prod_{n&gt;0}(1-q^{4n})}\sum_{n\in \mathbf{Z}}{(-1)^nq^{6n(n+1)}\over 1-q^{4n+1}}
&lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A053251}}.

:&lt;math&gt;
\chi(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{n^2}\over \prod_{1\le i\le n}(1-q^i+q^{2i})} = {1\over 2 \prod_{n&gt;0}(1-q^n)}\sum_{n\in \mathbf{Z}}{(-1)^n(1+q^n)q^{n(3n+1)/2}\over 1-q^n+q^{2n}}
&lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A053252}}.

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{2n(n+1)}\over (q;q^2)^2_{n+1}} = {1\over \prod_{n&gt;0}(1-q^{2n})}\sum_{n\ge 0}{(-1)^nq^{3n(n+1)} {1+q^{2n+1}\over 1-q^{2n+1}}} 
&lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A053253}}.

:&lt;math&gt;
\nu(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{n(n+1)}\over (-q;q^2)_{n+1}} = {1\over \prod_{n&gt;0}(1-q^n)}\sum_{n\ge 0}{(-1)^nq^{3n(n+1)/2}{1-q^{2n+1}\over 1+q^{2n+1}}}
&lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A053254}}.

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{2n(n+1)}\over \prod_{0\le i\le n}(1+q^{2i+1}+q^{4i+2})} = {1\over \prod_{n&gt;0}(1-q^{2n})}\sum_{n\ge 0}{(-1)^nq^{3n(n+1)} {1-q^{4n+2}\over 1+q^{2n+1}+q^{4n+2}}} 
&lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A053255}}.

The first four of these form a group with the same shadow (up to a constant), and so do the last three. More precisely, the functions satisfy the following relations (found by Ramanujan and proved by Watson):
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                                                       2\phi(-q) - f(q) &amp;= f(q) + 4\psi(-q) = \theta_4(0,q)\prod_{r &gt; 0}\left(1 + q^r\right)^{-1} \\
                                                        4\chi(q) - f(q) &amp;= 3\theta_4^2(0, q^3)\prod_{r &gt; 0}\left(1 - q^r\right)^{-1} \\
                                                   2\rho(q) + \omega(q) &amp;= 3\left(\frac{1}{2}q^{-\frac{3}{8}}\theta_2(0, q^\frac{3}{2})\right)^2\prod_{r &gt; 0}\left(1 - q^{2r}\right)^{-1} \\
                                   \nu(\pm q) \pm q\omega\left(q^2\right) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}q^{-\frac{1}{4}}\theta_2(0, q)\prod_{r &gt; 0}\left(1 + q^{2r}\right) \\
  f\left(q^8\right) \pm 2q\omega(\pm q) \pm 2q^3\omega\left(-q^4\right) &amp;= \theta_3(0, \pm q)\theta_3^2\left(0, q^2\right)\prod_{r &gt; 0}\left(1 - q^{4r}\right)^{-2} \\
                                      f(q^8) + q\omega(q) - q\omega(-q) &amp;= \theta_3(0, q^4)
                \theta_3^2(0, q^2)\prod_{r &gt; 0}\left(1 - q^{4r}\right)^{-2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Order 5===
Ramanujan wrote down ten mock theta functions of order 5 in his 1920 letter to Hardy, and stated some relations between them that were proved by {{harvtxt|Watson|1937}}. In his lost notebook he stated some further identities relating these functions, equivalent to  the '''mock theta conjectures''' {{harv|Andrews|Garvan|1989}}, that were  proved by {{harvtxt|Hickerson|1988}}. {{harvtxt|Andrews|1986}} found representations of many of these functions as the quotient of an indefinite theta series by modular forms of weight 1/2.
:&lt;math&gt;f_0(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{n^2}\over (-q;q)_{n}}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A053256}}

===Order 6===
{{harvtxt|Ramanujan|1988}} wrote down seven mock theta functions of order 6 in his lost notebook, and stated 11 identities between them, which were proved in {{harv|Andrews|Hickerson|1991}}. Two  of Ramanujan's identities relate φ and ψ at various arguments, four of them express φ and ψ in terms of Appell–Lerch series, and the last five identities express 
the remaining five sixth-order mock theta functions in terms of φ and ψ. {{harvtxt|Berndt|Chan|2007}} discovered two more sixth order functions.
The order 6 mock theta functions are:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {(-1)^nq^{n^2}(q;q^2)_n\over (-q;q)_{2n}}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A053268}}

===Order 7===
Ramanujan gave three mock theta functions of order 7 in his 1920 letter to Hardy. They were studied by {{harvtxt|Selberg|1938}}, who found asymptotic expansion for their coefficients, and in {{harv|Andrews|1986}}. {{harvtxt|Hickerson|1988}} found representations of many of these functions as the quotients of  indefinite theta series by modular forms of weight 1/2. {{harvs|txt|last=Zwegers|year1=2001|year2=2002}} described their modular transformation properties. 
*&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle F_0(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0}{q^{n^2}\over (q^{n+1};q)_n}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A053275}}
*&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle F_1(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0}{q^{n^2}\over (q^{n};q)_n}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A053276}}
*&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle F_2(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0}{q^{n(n+1)}\over (q^{n+1};q)_{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A053277}}
These three mock theta functions have different shadows, so unlike the case of Ramanujan's order 3 and order 5 functions, there are no linear relations between them and ordinary modular forms.
The corresponding weak Maass forms are
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
M_1(\tau) &amp; = q^{-1/168}F_1(q) + R_{7,1}(\tau) \\[4pt]
M_2(\tau) &amp; = -q^{-25/168}F_2(q) + R_{7,2}(\tau) \\[4pt]
M_3(\tau) &amp; = q^{47/168}F_3(q) + R_{7,3}(\tau)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;R_{p,j}(\tau) = \!\!\!\! \sum_{n\equiv j\bmod p}{12\choose n}\sgn(n)\beta(n^2y/6p)q^{-n^2/24p}&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;\beta(x) = \int_x^\infty u^{-1/2}e^{-\pi u} \, du&lt;/math&gt;

is more or less the complementary error function.
Under the metaplectic group, these three functions transform according to a certain 3-dimensional representation of the metaplectic group as follows

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
M_j(-1/\tau) &amp; = \sqrt{\tau/7i}\,\sum_{k=1}^32\sin(6\pi jk/7)M_k(\tau) \\[6pt]
M_1(\tau+1) &amp; = e^{-2\pi i/168} M_1(\tau), \\[6pt]
M_2(\tau+1) &amp; = e^{-2\times 25\pi i/168} M_2(\tau), \\[6pt]
M_3(\tau+1) &amp; = e^{-2\times 121\pi i/168} M_3(\tau).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, they are the components of a level 1 vector-valued harmonic weak Maass form  of weight&amp;nbsp;1/2.

===Order 8===
{{harvtxt|Gordon|McIntosh|2000}} found eight mock theta functions of order 8. They found five linear relations involving them, and expressed four of the functions as Appell–Lerch sums, and described their transformations under the modular group. 
The two functions ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; were found earlier by {{harvtxt|Ramanujan|1988|loc=p. 8, eqn 1; p. 29 eqn 6}} in his lost notebook.
:&lt;math&gt;S_0(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{n^2} (-q;q^2)_n \over (-q^2;q^2)_n}&lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A153148}}
:&lt;math&gt;S_1(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{n(n+2)} (-q;q^2)_n \over (-q^2;q^2)_n}&lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A153149}}
:&lt;math&gt;T_0(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{(n+1)(n+2)} (-q^2;q^2)_n \over (-q;q^2)_{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A153155}}
:&lt;math&gt;T_1(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{n(n+1)} (-q^2;q^2)_n \over (-q;q^2)_{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A153156}}
:&lt;math&gt;U_0(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{n^2} (-q;q^2)_n \over (-q^4;q^4)_n}&lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A153172}}
:&lt;math&gt;U_1(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{(n+1)^2} (-q;q^2)_n \over (-q^2;q^4)_{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A153174}}
:&lt;math&gt;V_0(q) = -1+2\sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{n^2} (-q;q^2)_n \over (q;q^2)_n} = -1+2\sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{2n^2} (-q^2;q^4)_n \over (q;q^2)_{2n+1}}&lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A153176}}
:&lt;math&gt;V_1(q) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{(n+1)^2} (-q;q^2)_n \over (q;q^2)_{n+1}} = \sum_{n\ge 0} {q^{2n^2+2n+1} (-q^4;q^4)_n \over (q;q^2)_{2n+2}}&lt;/math&gt;  {{OEIS|id=A153178}}

===Order 10===
{{harvtxt|Ramanujan|1988|p=9}} listed four order-10 mock theta functions in his lost notebook, and stated some relations between them, which were proved by {{harvs|last=Choi|txt|year1=1999|year2=2000|year3=2002|year4=2007}}.
*&lt;math&gt; \phi(q)=\sum_{n\ge 0}{q^{n(n+1)/2}\over (q;q^2)_{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A053281}}
*&lt;math&gt; \psi(q)=\sum_{n\ge 0}{q^{(n+1)(n+2)/2}\over (q;q^2)_{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A053282}}
*&lt;math&gt; \Chi(q)=\sum_{n\ge 0}{(-1)^nq^{n^2}\over (-q;q)_{2n}}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A053283}}
*&lt;math&gt; \chi(q)=\sum_{n\ge 0}{(-1)^nq^{(n+1)^2}\over (-q;q)_{2n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A053284}}

is observable or not, where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{D}&lt;/math&gt; are, respectively, &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n\times p&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;q\times n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q\times p&lt;/math&gt; matrices. 

One of the many ways one can achieve such goal is by the use of the Observability Gramian.


== Observability in LTI Systems==
Linear Time Invariant (LTI) Systems are those systems in which the parameters &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{D}&lt;/math&gt; are invariant with respect to time.

One can determine if the LTI system is or is not observable simply by looking at the pair &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{C})&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we can say that the following statements are equivalent:

1. The pair &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{C})&lt;/math&gt; is observable.

2. The &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix 

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W_{o}}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}\tau}\boldsymbol{C^{T}C}e^{\boldsymbol{A}\tau}d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

is nonsingular for any &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

3. The &lt;math&gt;nq\times n&lt;/math&gt; observability matrix

&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c}
\boldsymbol{C}\\
\boldsymbol{CA}\\
\boldsymbol{CA}^{2}\\
\vdots\\
\boldsymbol{CA}^{n-1}
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

has rank n.

4. The &lt;math&gt;(n + q)\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix 

&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c}
\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{-\lambda}\boldsymbol{I}\\
\boldsymbol{C}
\end{array}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

has full column rank at every eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

5. If, in addition, all eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; have negative real parts (&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; is stable), then the unique solution of

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A^{T}}\boldsymbol{W}_{o}+\boldsymbol{W}_{o}\boldsymbol{A}=-\boldsymbol{C^{T}C}&lt;/math&gt;

is positive definite. The solution is called the Observability Gramian and can be expressed as

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W_{o}}=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{\boldsymbol{A}^{T}\tau}\boldsymbol{C^{T}C}e^{\boldsymbol{A}\tau}d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

In the following section we are going to take a closer look at the Observability Gramian.

== Observability Gramian ==

The Observability Gramian can be found as the solution of the Lyapunov equation given by

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A^{T}}\boldsymbol{W}_{o}+\boldsymbol{W}_{o}\boldsymbol{A}=-\boldsymbol{C^{T}C}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, we can see that if we take

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W_{o}}=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}\tau}\boldsymbol{C^{T}C}e^{\boldsymbol{A}\tau}d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

as a solution, we are going to find that:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ccccc}
\boldsymbol{A^{T}}\boldsymbol{W}_{o}+\boldsymbol{W}_{o}\boldsymbol{A} &amp; = &amp; \int_{0}^{\infty}\boldsymbol{A^{T}}e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}\tau}\boldsymbol{C^{T}C}e^{\boldsymbol{A}\tau}d\tau &amp; + &amp; \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}\tau}\boldsymbol{C^{T}C}e^{\boldsymbol{A}\tau}\boldsymbol{A}d\tau\\
 &amp; = &amp; \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{d}{d\tau}(e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}\tau}\boldsymbol{C}^{T}\boldsymbol{C}e^{\boldsymbol{A}\tau})d\tau &amp; = &amp; e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}t}\boldsymbol{C}^{T}\boldsymbol{C}e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}|_{t=0}^{\infty}\\
 &amp; = &amp; \boldsymbol{0}-\boldsymbol{C^{T}C}\\
 &amp; = &amp; \boldsymbol{-C^{T}C}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Where we used the fact that &lt;math&gt;e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}=0&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;t=\infty&lt;/math&gt; for stable &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; (all its eigenvalues have negative real part). This shows us that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{o}&lt;/math&gt; is indeed the solution for the Lyapunov equation under analysis.

=== Properties ===

We can see that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C^{T}C}&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetric matrix, therefore, so is &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{o}&lt;/math&gt;. 

We can use again the fact that, if &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; is stable (all its eigenvalues have negative real part) to show that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{o}&lt;/math&gt; is unique. In order to prove so, suppose we have two different solutions for 

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A^{T}}\boldsymbol{W}_{o}+\boldsymbol{W}_{o}\boldsymbol{A}=-\boldsymbol{C^{T}C}&lt;/math&gt;

and they are given by &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{o1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{o2}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A^{T}}\boldsymbol{(W}_{o1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{o2})+\boldsymbol{(W}_{o1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{o2})\boldsymbol{A}=\boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by &lt;math&gt;e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}t}&lt;/math&gt; by the left and by &lt;math&gt;e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}&lt;/math&gt; by the right, would lead us to

&lt;math&gt;e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}t}[\boldsymbol{A^{T}}\boldsymbol{(W}_{o1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{o2})+\boldsymbol{(W}_{o1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{o2})\boldsymbol{A}]e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}=\frac{d}{dt}[e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}t}[(\boldsymbol{W}_{o1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{o2})e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}]=\boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;[e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}t}[(\boldsymbol{W}_{o1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{o2})e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}]|_{t=0}^{\infty}=\boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

using the fact that &lt;math&gt;e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;t\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{0}-(\boldsymbol{W}_{o1}-\boldsymbol{W}_{o2})=\boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{o}&lt;/math&gt; has to be unique.

Also, we can see that

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x^{T}W_{o}x}=\int_{0}^{\infty}\boldsymbol{x}^{T}e^{\boldsymbol{A^{T}}t}\boldsymbol{C^{T}C}e^{\boldsymbol{A}t}\boldsymbol{x}dt=\int_{0}^{\infty}\left\Vert \boldsymbol{Ce^{\boldsymbol{A}t}\boldsymbol{x}}\right\Vert _{2}^{2}dt&lt;/math&gt;

is positive for any t, and that makes &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{o}&lt;/math&gt; a positive definite matrix. 

More properties of observable systems can be found in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Chi-Tsong|title=Linear System Theory and Design Third Edition|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-19-511777-8|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as the proof for the other equivalent statements of “The pair &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{C})&lt;/math&gt; is observable” presented in section Observability in LTI Systems.

== Discrete Time Systems ==

For discrete time systems as

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c}
\boldsymbol{x}[k+1]\boldsymbol{=Ax}[k]+\boldsymbol{Bu}[k]\\
\boldsymbol{y}[k]=\boldsymbol{Cx}[k]+\boldsymbol{Du}[k]
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

One can check that there are equivalences for the statement “The pair &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{C})&lt;/math&gt; is observable” (the equivalences are much alike for the continuous time case). 

We are interested in the equivalence that claims that, if “The pair &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{C})&lt;/math&gt; is observable” and all the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; have magnitude less than &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; is stable), then the unique solution of

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A^{T}}\boldsymbol{W}_{do}\boldsymbol{A}-W_{do}=-\boldsymbol{C^{T}C}&lt;/math&gt;

is positive definite and given by

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{do}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}(\boldsymbol{A}^{T})^{m}\boldsymbol{C}^{T}\boldsymbol{C}\boldsymbol{A}^{m}&lt;/math&gt;

That is called the discrete Observability Gramian. We can easily see the correspondence between discrete time and the continuous time case, that is, if we can check that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{dc}&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite, and all eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; have magnitude less than &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the system &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{B})&lt;/math&gt; is observable. More properties and proofs can be found in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Chi-Tsong|title=Linear System Theory and Design Third Edition|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-19-511777-8|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Linear Time Variant Systems ==

Linear time variant (LTV) systems are those in the form:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c}
\dot{\boldsymbol{x}}(t)\boldsymbol{=A}(t)\boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{B}(t)\boldsymbol{u}(t)\\
\boldsymbol{y}(t)=\boldsymbol{C}(t)\boldsymbol{x}(t)
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the matrices &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt; have entries that varies with time. Again, as well as in the continuous time case and in the discrete time case, one may be interested in discovering if the system given by the pair &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A}(t),\boldsymbol{C}(t))&lt;/math&gt; is observable or not. This can be done in a very similar way of the preceding cases.

The system &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{A}(t),\boldsymbol{C}(t))&lt;/math&gt; is observable at time &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists a finite &lt;math&gt;t_{1}&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; such that the &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix also called the Observability Gramian is given by

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{o}(t_{0},t_{1})=\int_{_{0}}^{^{\infty}}\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{T}(t_{1},\tau)\boldsymbol{C}^{T}(\tau)\boldsymbol{C}(\tau)\boldsymbol{\Phi}(t_{1},\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Phi}(t,\tau)&lt;/math&gt; is the state transition matrix of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\dot{x}}=\boldsymbol{A}(t)\boldsymbol{x}&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular.

Again, we have a similar method to determine if a system is or not a observable system.

=== Properties of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{o}(t_{0},t_{1}&lt;/math&gt;) ===

We have that the Observability Gramian &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{o}(t_{0},t_{1})&lt;/math&gt; have the following property:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{o}(t_{0},t_{1})=\boldsymbol{W}_{o}(t_{0},t)+\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{T}(t,t_{0})\boldsymbol{W}_{o}(t,t_{0})\boldsymbol{\Phi}(t,t_{0})&lt;/math&gt;

that can easily be seen by the definition of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{W}_{o}(t_{0},t_{1})&lt;/math&gt; and by the property of the state transition matrix that claims that:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Phi}(t_{0},t_{1})=\boldsymbol{\Phi}(t_{1},\tau)\boldsymbol{\Phi}(\tau,t_{0})&lt;/math&gt;

More about the Observability Gramian can be found in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Chi-Tsong|title=Linear System Theory and Design Third Edition|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-19-511777-8|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6966">In [[mathematics]], '''Ramanujan's congruences''' are some remarkable congruences for the [[Partition (number theory)|partition function]] ''p''(''n''). The mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] discovered the congruences

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
p(5k+4) &amp; \equiv 0 \pmod 5 \\
p(7k+5) &amp; \equiv 0 \pmod 7 \\
p(11k+6) &amp; \equiv 0 \pmod {11}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This means that:

* If a number is 4 more than a multiple of 5, i.e. it is in the sequence
:: 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, . . .
: then the number of its partitions is a multiple of 5.

* If a number is 5 more than a multiple of 7, i.e. it is in the sequence
:: 5, 12, 19, 26, 33, 40, . . .
: then the number of its partitions is a multiple of 7.

* If a number is 6 more than a multiple of 11, i.e. it is in the sequence
:: 6, 17, 28, 39, 50, 61, . . .
: then the number of its partitions is a multiple of 11..

== Background ==

In his 1919 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramanujan |first=S. |title=Congruence properties of partitions |journal=[[Mathematische Zeitschrift]] |volume=9 |year=1921 |pages=147–153 |doi=10.1007/bf01378341}}&lt;/ref&gt; he gave proof for the first two congruences using the following identities (using [[q-Pochhammer symbol]] notation):

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \sum_{k=0}^\infty p(5k+4)q^k=5\frac{(q^5)_\infty^5}{(q)_\infty^6} \\
&amp; \sum_{k=0}^\infty p(7k+5)q^k=7\frac{(q^7)_\infty^3}{(q)_\infty^4}+49q\frac{(q^7)_\infty^7}{(q)_\infty^8}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

then stated that "It appears there are no equally simple properties for any moduli involving primes other than these".

After Ramanujan died in 1920, [[G. H. Hardy]] extracted proofs of all three congruences from an unpublished manuscript of Ramanujan on ''p''(''n'') (Ramanujan, 1921). The proof in this manuscript employs [[Eisenstein series]].

In 1944, [[Freeman Dyson]] defined the rank function and conjectured the existence of a [[crank (mathematics)|crank]] function for partitions that would provide a [[combinatorial proof]] of Ramanujan's congruences modulo 11. Forty years later, [[George Andrews (mathematician)|George Andrews]] and [[Frank Garvan]] successfully found such a function, and proved the celebrated result that the crank simultaneously "explains" the three Ramanujan congruences modulo 5, 7 and 11.

In the 1960s, [[A. O. L. Atkin]] of the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] discovered additional congruences for small prime moduli. For example:
:&lt;math&gt;p(11^3 \cdot 13k + 237)\equiv 0 \pmod {13}.&lt;/math&gt;

Extending the results of A. Atkin, [[Ken Ono]] in 2000 proved that there are such Ramanujan congruences modulo every integer coprime to 6. For example, his results give
:&lt;math&gt;p(107^4\cdot 31k + 30064597)\equiv 0\pmod{31}.&lt;/math&gt;
Later [[Ken Ono]] conjectured that the elusive crank also satisfies exactly the same types of general congruences. This was proved by his Ph.D. student [[Karl Mahlburg]] in his 2005 paper ''Partition Congruences and the Andrews–Garvan–Dyson Crank'', linked below. This paper won the first [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] Paper of the Year prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pnas.org/site/misc/cozzarelliprize.xhtml | title=Cozzarelli Prize | publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] | date=June 2014 | accessdate=2014-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A conceptual explanation for Ramanujan's observation was finally discovered in January 2011 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.aim.2011.11.013|title=ℓ-Adic properties of the partition function|journal=[[Advances in Mathematics]]|volume=229|issue=3|pages=1586|year=2012|last1=Folsom|first1=Amanda|last2=Kent|first2=Zachary A.|last3=Ono|first3=Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt; by considering the [[Hausdorff dimension]] of the following &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; function in the [[P-adic number|l-adic]] topology:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\ell(b;z) := \sum_{n=0}^\infty p\left(\frac{\ell^bn+1}{24}\right)q^{n/24}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is seen to have dimension 0 only in the cases where ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;= 5,&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;11 and since the partition function can be written as a linear combination of these functions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bruinier  |first=J. H. |last2=Ono |first2=K. |year= |title=Algebraic Formulas for the Coefficients of Half-Integral Weight Harmonic Weak Maas Forms |url=http://www.aimath.org/news/partition/brunier-ono.pdf |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |arxiv=1104.1182|bibcode=2011arXiv1104.1182H}}&lt;/ref&gt; this can be considered a formalization and proof of Ramanujan's observation.

In 2001, R.L. Weaver gave an effective algorithm for finding congruences of the partition function, and tabulated 76,065 congruences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1011493128408|year=2001|last1=Weaver|first1=Rhiannon L.|title=New congruences for the partition function|journal=[[The Ramanujan Journal]]|volume=5|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was extended in 2012 by F. Johansson to 22,474,608,014 congruences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1112/S1461157012001088|title=Efficient implementation of the Hardy–Ramanujan–Rademacher formula|journal=[[LMS Journal of Computation and Mathematics]]|volume=15|pages=341|year=2012|last1=Johansson|first1=Fredrik}}&lt;/ref&gt; one large example being
:&lt;math&gt;p(999959^4\cdot29k+ 28995221336976431135321047) \equiv 0 \pmod{29}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[computing]], '''scheduling''' is the method by which work specified by some means is assigned to resources that complete the work.  The work may be virtual computation elements such as [[thread (computer science)|threads]], [[process (computing)|processes]] or data [[flow (computer networking)|flows]], which are in turn scheduled onto hardware resources such as [[central processing unit|processors]], [[telecommunications link|network links]] or [[expansion card]]s.

A scheduler is what carries out the scheduling activity.  Schedulers are often implemented so they keep all computer resources busy (as in [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]]), allow multiple users to share system resources effectively, or to achieve a target [[quality of service]].  Scheduling is fundamental to computation itself, and an intrinsic part of the [[execution model]] of a computer system; the concept of scheduling makes it possible to have [[computer multitasking]] with a single [[central processing unit]] (CPU).

A scheduler may aim at one or more of many goals, for example: 
&lt;!-- throughput --&gt;
maximizing ''[[throughput]]'' (the total amount of work completed per time unit); 
&lt;!-- wait time --&gt;
minimizing  ''[[Computer performance#Response time|wait time]]'' 
(time from work becoming enabled until the first point it begins execution on resources); 
&lt;!-- response_time/latency for batch systems --&gt;
minimizing ''[[latency (engineering)|latency]]'' or ''[[Response time (technology)|response time]]'' (time from work becoming enabled until it is finished in case of batch activity,&lt;ref name="liu1973"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;!-- fairness --&gt;
or maximizing ''fairness'' (equal CPU time to each process, or more generally appropriate times according to the priority and workload of each process).  In practice, these goals often conflict (e.g. throughput versus latency), thus a scheduler will implement a suitable compromise.  Preference is measured by any one of the concerns mentioned above, depending upon the user's needs and objectives.

In [[real-time computing|real-time]] environments, such as [[embedded system]]s for [[automatic control]] in industry (for example [[robotics]]), the scheduler also must ensure that processes can meet [[time limit|deadlines]]; this is crucial for keeping the system stable. Scheduled tasks can also be distributed to remote devices across a network and [[device Management|managed]] through an administrative back end.

=={{Anchor|SCHEDULER}}Types of operating system schedulers==
{{See also|Network scheduler|I/O scheduling|Job scheduler}}

The scheduler is an operating system module that selects the next jobs to be admitted into the system and the next process to run. Operating systems may feature up to three distinct scheduler types: a ''long-term scheduler'' (also known as an admission scheduler or high-level scheduler), a ''mid-term or medium-term scheduler'', and a ''short-term scheduler''. The names suggest the relative frequency with which their functions are performed.

==={{Anchor|PROCESS}}Process scheduler===
The process scheduler is a part of the operating system that decides which process runs at a certain point in time. It usually has the ability to pause a running process, move it to the back of the running queue and start a new process; such a scheduler is known as ''[[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] scheduler'', otherwise it is a ''[[Nonpreemptive multitasking|cooperative]] scheduler''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{Anchor|LONG-TERM}}Long-term scheduling====
The ''long-term scheduler'', or ''admission scheduler'', decides which jobs or processes are to be admitted to the ready queue (in main memory); that is, when an attempt is made to execute a program, its admission to the set of currently executing processes is either authorized or delayed by the long-term scheduler. Thus, this scheduler dictates what processes are to run on a system, and the degree of concurrency to be supported at any one time{{snd}} whether many or few processes are to be executed concurrently, and how the split between I/O-intensive and CPU-intensive processes is to be handled. The long-term scheduler is responsible for controlling the degree of multiprogramming.

In general, most processes can be described as either [[I/O-bound]] or [[CPU-bound]]. An I/O-bound process is one that spends more of its time doing I/O than it spends doing computations. A CPU-bound process, in contrast, generates I/O requests infrequently, using more of its time doing computations. It is important that a long-term scheduler selects a good process mix of I/O-bound and CPU-bound processes. If all processes are I/O-bound, the ready queue will almost always be empty, and the short-term scheduler will have little to do. On the other hand, if all processes are CPU-bound, the I/O waiting queue will almost always be empty, devices will go unused, and again the system will be unbalanced. The system with the best performance will thus have a combination of CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes. In modern operating systems, this is used to make sure that real-time processes get enough CPU time to finish their tasks.&lt;ref name="galvin"&gt;{{cite book
| authors = [[Abraham Silberschatz]], Peter Baer Galvin and Greg Gagne
| title = Operating System Concepts
| volume = 9
| year= 2013
| publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.
| isbn= 978-1-118-06333-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term scheduling is also important in large-scale systems such as [[batch processing]] systems, [[computer cluster]]s, [[supercomputer]]s, and [[render farm]]s. For example, in [[concurrent computing|concurrent systems]], [[coscheduling]] of interacting processes is often required to prevent them from blocking due to waiting on each other. In these cases, special-purpose [[job scheduler]] software is typically used to assist these functions, in addition to any underlying admission scheduling support in the operating system.

===={{Anchor|MEDIUM-TERM}}Medium-term scheduling====
The ''medium-term scheduler'' temporarily removes processes from main memory and places them in secondary memory (such as a [[hard disk drive]]) or vice versa, which is commonly referred to as "swapping out" or "swapping in" (also incorrectly as "[[paging]] out" or "paging in").  The medium-term scheduler may decide to swap out a process which has not been active for some time, or a process which has a low priority, or a process which is [[page fault]]ing frequently, or a process which is taking up a large amount of memory in order to free up main memory for other processes, swapping the process back in later when more memory is available, or when the process has been unblocked and is no longer waiting for a resource.  [Stallings, 396]  [Stallings, 370]

In many systems today (those that support mapping virtual address space to secondary storage other than the swap file), the medium-term scheduler may actually perform the role of the long-term scheduler, by treating binaries as "swapped out processes" upon their execution.  In this way, when a segment of the binary is required it can be swapped in on demand, or "lazy loaded".  [Stallings, 394]

===={{Anchor|SHORT-TERM}}Short-term scheduling====
The ''short-term scheduler'' (also known as the ''CPU scheduler'') decides which of the ready, in-memory processes is to be executed (allocated a CPU) after a clock [[interrupt]], an I/O interrupt, an operating [[system call]] or another form of [[Signal programming|signal]].  Thus the short-term scheduler makes scheduling decisions much more frequently than the long-term or mid-term schedulers{{snd}}a scheduling decision will at a minimum have to be made after every time slice, and these are very short.  This scheduler can be [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]], implying that it is capable of forcibly removing processes from a CPU when it decides to allocate that CPU to another process, or non-preemptive (also known as "voluntary" or "co-operative"), in which case the scheduler is unable to "force" processes off the CPU.

A preemptive scheduler relies upon a [[programmable interval timer]] which invokes an [[interrupt handler]] that runs in [[kernel mode]] and implements the scheduling function.

===={{Anchor|DISPATCH-LATENCY}}Dispatcher====
Another component that is involved in the CPU-scheduling function is the dispatcher, which is the module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler. It receives control in kernel mode as the result of an interrupt or system call. The functions of a dispatcher involve the following:

* [[Context switch]]es, in which the dispatcher saves the [[State (computer science)|state]] (also known as [[Context (computing)|context]]) of the [[Process (computing)|process]] or [[Thread (computing)|thread]] that was previously running; the dispatcher then loads the initial or previously saved state of the new process.
* Switching to user mode.
* Jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program indicated by its new state.

The dispatcher should be as fast as possible, since it is invoked during every process switch. During the context switches, the processor is virtually idle for a fraction of time, thus unnecessary context switches should be avoided. The time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another is known as the ''dispatch latency''.&lt;ref name="galvin" /&gt;{{rp|155}}

==Scheduling disciplines==
Scheduling disciplines are algorithms used for distributing resources among parties which simultaneously and asynchronously request them. Scheduling disciplines are used in [[router (computing)|router]]s (to handle packet traffic) as well as in [[operating system]]s (to share [[CPU time]] among both [[thread (computer science)|threads]] and [[process (computing)|processes]]), disk drives ([[I/O scheduling]]), printers ([[print spooler]]), most embedded systems, etc.

The main purposes of scheduling algorithms are to minimize [[resource starvation]] and to ensure fairness amongst the parties utilizing the resources. Scheduling deals with the problem of deciding which of the outstanding requests is to be allocated resources. There are many different scheduling algorithms. In this section, we introduce several of them.

In [[packet-switched]] [[computer networks]] and other [[statistical multiplexing]], the notion of a '''scheduling algorithm''' is used as an alternative to [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|first-come first-served]] queuing of data packets.

The simplest best-effort scheduling algorithms are [[round-robin scheduling|round-robin]], [[fair queuing]] (a [[max-min fair]] scheduling algorithm), [[proportionally fair]] scheduling and [[maximum throughput scheduling|maximum throughput]]. If differentiated or guaranteed [[quality of service]] is offered, as opposed to best-effort communication, [[weighted fair queuing]] may be utilized.

In advanced packet radio wireless networks such as [[HSDPA]] (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access) [[3.5G]] cellular system, '''channel-dependent scheduling''' may be used to take advantage of [[channel state information]]. If the channel conditions are favourable, the [[throughput]] and [[system spectral efficiency]] may be increased. In even more advanced systems such as [[LTE Advanced|LTE]], the scheduling is combined by channel-dependent packet-by-packet [[dynamic channel allocation]], or by assigning [[OFDMA]] multi-carriers or other [[frequency-domain equalization]] components to the users that best can utilize them.&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Guowang Miao]]|author2=Jens Zander|author3=Ki Won Sung|author4=Ben Slimane|title=Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=1107143217|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First come, first served===
{{Main article|FIFO (computing and electronics)}}

[[File:Thread pool.svg|thumb|400px|A sample [[thread pool]] (green boxes) with a queue (FIFO) of waiting tasks (blue) and a queue of completed tasks (yellow)]]

''First in, first out'' ([[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]]), also known as ''first come, first served'' (FCFS), is the simplest scheduling algorithm. FIFO simply queues processes in the order that they arrive in the ready queue. This is commonly used for a '''{{visible anchor|task queue}}''', for example as illustrated in this section.

* Since context switches only occur upon process termination, and no reorganization of the process queue is required, scheduling overhead is minimal.
* Throughput can be low, because long processes can be holding CPU, waiting the short processes for a long time (known as convoy effect).
* No starvation, because each process gets chance to be executed after a definite time.
* [[Turnaround time]], waiting time and response time depends on the order of their arrival and can be high for the same reasons above.
* No prioritization occurs, thus this system has trouble meeting process deadlines.
* The lack of prioritization means that as long as every process eventually completes, there is no starvation. In an environment where some processes might not complete, there can be starvation.
* It is based on queuing.

===Priority scheduling===
{{Main article|Earliest deadline first scheduling}}
{{See also|Deadline-monotonic scheduling|}}
Earliest deadline first (EDF) or ''least time to go'' is a dynamic scheduling algorithm used in real-time operating systems to place processes in a priority queue. Whenever a scheduling event occurs (a task finishes, new task is released, etc.), the queue will be searched for the process closest to its deadline, which will be the next to be scheduled for execution.

===Shortest remaining time first ===
{{Main article|Shortest remaining time}}

Similar to [[shortest job first]] (SJF). With this strategy the scheduler arranges processes with the least estimated processing time remaining to be next in the queue. This requires advanced knowledge or estimations about the time required for a process to complete.

* If a shorter process arrives during another process' execution, the currently running process is interrupted (known as preemption), dividing that process into two separate computing blocks. This creates excess overhead through additional context switching. The scheduler must also place each incoming process into a specific place in the queue, creating additional overhead.
* This algorithm is designed for maximum throughput in most scenarios.
* Waiting time and response time increase as the process's computational requirements increase. Since turnaround time is based on waiting time plus processing time, longer processes are significantly affected by this. Overall waiting time is smaller than FIFO, however since no process has to wait for the termination of the longest process.
* No particular attention is given to deadlines, the programmer can only attempt to make processes with deadlines as short as possible.
* Starvation is possible, especially in a busy system with many small processes being run.
* To use this policy we should have at least two processes of different priority

===Fixed priority pre-emptive scheduling===
{{Main article|Fixed priority pre-emptive scheduling}}

The operating system assigns a fixed priority rank to every process, and the scheduler arranges the processes in the ready queue in order of their priority.  Lower-priority processes get interrupted by incoming higher-priority processes.
* Overhead is not minimal, nor is it significant.
* FPPS has no particular advantage in terms of throughput over FIFO scheduling.
* If the number of rankings is limited, it can be characterized as a collection of FIFO queues, one for each priority ranking.  Processes in lower-priority queues are selected only when all of the higher-priority queues are empty.
* Waiting time and response time depend on the priority of the process.  Higher-priority processes have smaller waiting and response times.
* Deadlines can be met by giving processes with deadlines a higher priority.
* Starvation of lower-priority processes is possible with large numbers of high-priority processes queuing for CPU time.

===Round-robin scheduling===
{{Main article|Round-robin scheduling}}

The scheduler assigns a fixed time unit per process, and cycles through them. If process completes within that time-slice it gets terminated otherwise it is rescheduled after giving a chance to all other processes.

* RR scheduling involves extensive overhead, especially with a small time unit.
* Balanced throughput between FCFS/ FIFO and SJF/SRTF, shorter jobs are completed faster than in FIFO and longer processes are completed faster than in SJF.
* Good average response time, waiting time is dependent on number of processes, and not average process length.
* Because of high waiting times, deadlines are rarely met in a pure RR system.
* Starvation can never occur, since no priority is given. Order of time unit allocation is based upon process arrival time, similar to FIFO.
* If Time-Slice is large it becomes FCFS /FIFO or if it is short then it becomes SJF/SRTF.

===Multilevel queue scheduling===
{{Main article|Multilevel queue}}

This is used for situations in which processes are easily divided into different groups. For example, a common division is made between foreground (interactive) processes and background (batch) processes. These two types of processes have different response-time requirements and so may have different scheduling needs. It is very useful for shared memory problems.

===Work-conserving schedulers===
{{Main article|Work-conserving scheduler}}

A [[work-conserving scheduler]] is a scheduler that always tries to keep the scheduled resources busy, if there are submitted jobs ready to be scheduled. In contrast, a non-work conserving scheduler is a scheduler that, in some cases, may leave the scheduled resources idle despite the presence of jobs ready to be scheduled.

===Scheduling optimization problems===
There are several scheduling problems in which the goal is to decide which job goes to which station at what time, such that the total [[makespan]] is minimized:
* [[Job shop scheduling]]{{snd}} there are {{mvar|n}} jobs and {{mvar|m}} identical stations. Each job should be executed on a single machine. This is usually regarded as an online problem.
* [[Open-shop scheduling]]{{snd}} there are {{mvar|n}} jobs and {{mvar|m}} different stations. Each job should spend some time at each station, in a free order.
* [[Flow shop scheduling]]{{snd}} there are {{mvar|n}} jobs and {{mvar|m}} different stations. Each job should spend some time at each station, in a pre-determined order.

===Manual scheduling===
A very common method in embedded systems is to schedule jobs manually. This can for example be done in a time-multiplexed fashion. Sometimes the kernel is divided in three or more parts: Manual scheduling, preemptive and interrupt level. Exact methods for scheduling jobs are often proprietary.

* No resource starvation problems
* Very high predictability; allows implementation of hard real-time systems
* Almost no overhead
* May not be optimal for all applications
* Effectiveness is completely dependent on the implementation

===Choosing a scheduling algorithm===
When designing an operating system, a programmer must consider which scheduling algorithm will perform best for the use the system is going to see. There is no universal “best” scheduling algorithm, and many operating systems use extended or combinations of the scheduling algorithms above.

For example, [[Windows NT]]/XP/Vista uses a [[multilevel feedback queue]], a combination of fixed-priority preemptive scheduling, round-robin, and first in, first out algorithms. In this system, threads can dynamically increase or decrease in priority depending on if it has been serviced already, or if it has been waiting extensively. Every priority level is represented by its own queue, with [[round-robin scheduling]] among the high-priority threads and [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] among the lower-priority ones. In this sense, response time is short for most threads, and short but critical system threads get completed very quickly. Since threads can only use one time unit of the round-robin in the highest-priority queue, starvation can be a problem for longer high-priority threads.

==Operating system process scheduler implementations==
The algorithm used may be as simple as [[Round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] in which each process is given equal time (for instance 1&amp;nbsp;ms, usually between 1&amp;nbsp;ms and 100&amp;nbsp;ms) in a cycling list. So, process A executes for 1&amp;nbsp;ms, then process B, then process C, then back to process A.

More advanced algorithms take into account process priority, or the importance of the process.  This allows some processes to use more time than other processes. The kernel always uses whatever resources it needs to ensure proper functioning of the system, and so can be said to have infinite priority. In [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]](symmetric multiprocessing) systems, [[processor affinity]] is considered to increase overall system performance, even if it may cause a process itself to run more slowly.  This generally improves performance by reducing [[cache thrashing]].

===OS/360 and successors===
IBM [[OS/360 and successors|OS/360]] was available with three different schedulers.  The differences were such that the variants were often considered three different operating systems:

* The ''Single Sequential Scheduler'' option, also known as the ''Primary Control Program (PCP)'' provided sequential execution of a single stream of jobs.
* The ''Multiple Sequential Scheduler'' option, known as ''Multiprogramming with a Fixed Number of Tasks (MFT)'' provided execution of multiple concurrent jobs.  Execution was governed by a priority which had a default for each stream or could be requested separately for each job.  MFT version II added subtasks (threads), which executed at a priority based on that of the parent job.  Each job stream defined the maximum amount of memory which could be used by any job in that stream.
* The ''Multiple Priority Schedulers'' option, or ''Multiprogramming with a Variable Number of Tasks (MVT)'', featured subtasks from the start; each job requested the priority and memory it required before execution.

Later virtual storage versions of MVS added a ''[[Workload Manager]]'' feature to the scheduler, which schedules processor resources according to an elaborate scheme defined by the installation.

===Windows===
Very early [[MS-DOS]] and Microsoft Windows systems were non-multitasking, and as such did not feature a scheduler. [[Windows 3.1x]] used a non-preemptive scheduler, meaning that it did not interrupt programs. It relied on the program to end or tell the OS that it didn't need the processor so that it could move on to another process. This is usually called cooperative multitasking. Windows 95 introduced a rudimentary preemptive scheduler; however, for legacy support opted to let 16 bit applications run without preemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.jgcampbell.com/caos/html/node13.html |date=* |title=Early Windows }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Windows NT]]-based operating systems use a multilevel feedback queue. 32 priority levels are defined, 0 through to 31, with priorities 0 through 15 being "normal" priorities and priorities 16 through 31 being soft real-time priorities, requiring privileges to assign. 0 is reserved for the Operating System. Users can select 5 of these priorities to assign to a running application from the Task Manager application, or through thread management APIs. The kernel may change the priority level of a thread depending on its I/O and CPU usage and whether it is interactive (i.e. accepts and responds to input from humans), raising the priority of interactive and I/O bounded processes and lowering that of CPU bound processes, to increase the responsiveness of interactive applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Tale of Two Schedulers Windows NT and Windows CE |url=http://sriramk.com/schedulers.html |author=Sriram Krishnan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722015555/http://sriramk.com/schedulers.html |archivedate=July 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheduler was modified in [[Windows Vista]] to use the [[Time Stamp Counter|cycle counter register]] of modern processors to keep track of exactly how many CPU cycles a thread has executed, rather than just using an interval-timer interrupt routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc162494.aspx |title=Windows Administration: Inside the Windows Vista Kernel: Part 1 |website=Technet.microsoft.com |date=2016-11-14 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vista also uses a priority scheduler for the I/O queue so that disk defragmenters and other such programs do not interfere with foreground operations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080219174631/http://blog.gabefrost.com/?p=25 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic Mac OS and macOS===
Mac OS 9 uses cooperative scheduling for threads, where one process controls multiple cooperative threads, and also provides preemptive scheduling for multiprocessing tasks. The kernel schedules multiprocessing tasks using a preemptive scheduling algorithm. All Process Manager processes run within a special multiprocessing task, called the "blue task". Those processes are scheduled cooperatively, using a [[round-robin scheduling]] algorithm; a process yields control of the processor to another process by explicitly calling a {{req|blocking function}} such as &lt;code&gt;WaitNextEvent&lt;/code&gt;. Each process has its own copy of the [[Thread Manager]] that schedules that process's threads cooperatively; a thread yields control of the processor to another thread by calling &lt;code&gt;YieldToAnyThread&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;YieldToThread&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=appletn2028&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2028.html |title=Technical Notes |website=Developer.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

macOS uses a multilevel feedback queue, with four priority bands for threads{{snd}}normal, system high priority, kernel mode only, and real-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/scheduler/scheduler.html |title=Guides and Sample Code |website=Developer.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threads are scheduled preemptively; macOS also supports cooperatively scheduled threads in its implementation of the Thread Manager in [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]].&lt;ref name=appletn2028/&gt;

===AIX===
In AIX Version 4 there are three possible values for thread scheduling policy:

* First In, First Out: Once a thread with this policy is scheduled, it runs to completion unless it is blocked, it voluntarily yields control of the CPU, or a higher-priority thread becomes dispatchable. Only fixed-priority threads can have a FIFO scheduling policy.
* Round Robin: This is similar to the AIX Version 3 scheduler round-robin scheme based on 10ms time slices. When a RR thread has control at the end of the time slice, it moves to the tail of the queue of dispatchable threads of its priority. Only fixed-priority threads can have a Round Robin scheduling policy.
* OTHER: This policy is defined by POSIX1003.4a as implementation-defined. In AIX Version 4, this policy is defined to be equivalent to RR, except that it applies to threads with non-fixed priority. The recalculation of the running thread's priority value at each clock interrupt means that a thread may lose control because its priority value has risen above that of another dispatchable thread. This is the AIX Version 3 behavior.

Threads are primarily of interest for applications that currently consist of several asynchronous processes. These applications might impose a lighter load on the system if converted to a multithreaded structure.

AIX 5 implements the following scheduling policies: FIFO, round robin, and a fair round robin. The FIFO policy has three different implementations: FIFO, FIFO2, and FIFO3. The round robin policy is named SCHED_RR in AIX, and the fair round robin is called SCHED_OTHER.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aix5_cpu/index.html#N100F6]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094049/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aix5_cpu/index.html |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linux===
[[File:Simplified Structure of the Linux Kernel.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A highly simplified structure of the Linux kernel, which includes process schedulers, I/O schedulers, and [[Linux kernel packet scheduler|packet schedulers]] ]]

====Linux 2.4====
In [[Linux]] 2.4, an [[O(n) scheduler]] with a [[multilevel feedback queue]] with priority levels ranging from 0 to 140 was used; 0&amp;ndash;99 are reserved for real-time tasks and 100&amp;ndash;140 are considered [[nice (Unix)|nice]] task levels. For real-time tasks, the time quantum for switching processes was approximately 200&amp;nbsp;ms, and for nice tasks approximately 10 ms.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The scheduler ran through the [[run queue]] of all ready processes, letting the highest priority processes go first and run through their time slices, after which they will be placed in an expired queue. When the active queue is empty the expired queue will become the active queue and vice versa.

However, some enterprise [[Linux distributions]] such as [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] replaced this scheduler with a backport of the [[O(1) scheduler]] (which was maintained by [[Alan Cox]] in his Linux 2.4-ac Kernel series) to the Linux 2.4 kernel used by the distribution.

====Linux 2.6.0 to Linux 2.6.22====
In versions 2.6.0 to 2.6.22, the kernel used an [[O(1) scheduler]] developed by [[Ingo Molnar]] and many other kernel developers during the Linux 2.5 development. For many kernel in time frame, [[Con Kolivas]] developed patch sets which improved interactivity with this scheduler or even replaced it with his own schedulers.

====Since Linux 2.6.23====
Con Kolivas's work, most significantly his implementation of "[[Fair-share scheduling|fair scheduling]]" named "Rotating Staircase Deadline", inspired Ingo Molnár to develop the [[Completely Fair Scheduler]] as a replacement for the earlier [[O(1) scheduler]], crediting Kolivas in his announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list

       | date=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CFS is the first implementation of a fair queuing [[process scheduler]] widely used in a general-purpose operating system.&lt;ref name="dwrr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://happyli.org/tongli/papers/dwrr.pdf|format=PDF|title=Efficient and Scalable Multiprocessor Fair Scheduling Using Distributed Weighted Round-Robin|author1=Tong Li|author2=Dan Baumberger|author3=Scott Hahn|website=Happyli.org|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Completely Fair Scheduler]] (CFS) uses a well-studied, classic scheduling algorithm called [[fair queuing]] originally invented for [[packet network]]s. Fair queuing had been previously applied to CPU scheduling under the name [[stride scheduling]].  The fair queuing CFS scheduler has a scheduling complexity of O([[Logarithm|log]] N), where N is the number of tasks in the [[run queue|runqueue]]. Choosing a task can be done in constant time, but reinserting a task after it has run requires O(log N) operations, because the [[run queue]] is implemented as a [[red-black tree]].

The [[Brain Fuck Scheduler]] (BFS), also created by Con Kolivas, is an alternative to the CFS.

===FreeBSD===
[[FreeBSD]] uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging from 0–255. 0–63 are reserved for interrupts, 64–127 for the top half of the kernel, 128–159 for real-time user threads, 160–223 for time-shared user threads, and 224–255 for idle user threads. Also, like Linux, it uses the active queue setup, but it also has an idle queue.&lt;ref name="opensolaris-queue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparison of Solaris, Linux, and FreeBSD Kernels |url=http://cn.opensolaris.org/files/solaris_linux_bsd_cmp.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807124435/http://cn.opensolaris.org/files/solaris_linux_bsd_cmp.pdf |archivedate=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NetBSD===
[[NetBSD]] uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging from 0–223. 0–63 are reserved for time-shared threads (default, SCHED_OTHER policy), 64–95 for user threads which entered [[kernel space]], 96-128 for kernel threads, 128–191 for user real-time threads (SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR policies), and 192–223 for [[Interrupt|software interrupts]].

===Solaris===
[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging between 0 and 169. Priorities 0&amp;ndash;59 are reserved for time-shared threads, 60&amp;ndash;99 for system threads, 100&amp;ndash;159 for real-time threads, and 160&amp;ndash;169 for low priority interrupts. Unlike Linux,&lt;ref name="opensolaris-queue"/&gt; when a process is done using its time quantum, it is given a new priority and put back in the queue. Solaris&amp;nbsp;9 introduced two new scheduling classes, namely fixed priority class and fair share class. The threads with fixed priority have the same priority range as that of the time-sharing class, but their priorities are not dynamically adjusted. The fair scheduling class uses CPU ''shares'' to prioritize threads for scheduling decisions. CPU shares indicate the entitlement to CPU resources. They are allocated to a set of processes, which are collectively known as a project.&lt;ref name="galvin"/&gt;

'''Simplexity''' is an emerging theory that proposes a possible complementary relationship between [[complexity]] and [[simplicity]]. The term draws from [[General Systems Theory]], [[Dialectics]] (philosophy) and [[Design]]. Jeffrey Kluger wrote a book about this phenomenon that describes how house plants can be more complicated than industrial plants, how a truck driver's job can be as difficult as a CEO's and why 90% of the money donated to help cure diseases are given only to the research of 10% of them (and vice versa).

The term has been adopted in [[advertising]], [[marketing]] and other industries.

== Design aspects ==
* Complexity tends to rise as system elements specialize and diversify to solve specific challenges.
* Simple interfaces tend to improve the usability of complex systems.

== History of the term ==
Like most terms, it has been shaped through dialogues and discussion. Several individuals have participated in the development of the meaning of this term in both formal and informal venues. Most notable is Anuraj Gambhir who is attributed with the creation and popularisation of this term through various presentations and conferences around the world.

=== Education ===

One of the first formally published instances of the word was in the journal 'Childhood Education' (1924), in the article it appears to be used to discuss education and psychology related issues.&lt;ref name="unknown"&gt;(Unknown).  [https://books.google.com/books?vid=0U0D8M_nRfBL9oKrN_&amp;id=d5vHZ2xXBa0C&amp;q=simplexity&amp;dq=simplexity&amp;pgis=1 Childhood Education] Published 1924. Association for Childhood Education International.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In science ===

[[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] and  [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] authors of the book ''[[The Collapse of Chaos]]'' (1995), a non-fiction book that attempts to explain [[chaos theory]] and [[complex systems]] to the general public.

The [[analysis of algorithms|complexity of algorithms and of mathematical problems]] is one of the central subjects of [[theoretical computer science]].  Simplexity was whimsically defined by computer scientists [[Andrei Broder|Broder]] and [[Jorge Stolfi|Stolfi]] as a concept worthy of as much attention as complexity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The simplexity of a problem is the maximum inefficiency among the reluctant algorithms that solve P .  An algorithm is said to be pessimal for a problem P if the best-cast inefficiency of A is asymptotically equal to the simplexity of P"&lt;ref name="Broder"&gt;Broder, Andrei and Jorge Stolfi. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=990536 "Pessimal Algorithms and Simplexity Analysis."]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The concept of Simplexity was amplified in the mid 1970s by Bruce Schiff (self-described theorist) and restated as "The process by which nature strives towards simple ends by complex means. The result of a simple random act can only be predicted by complicated means. The spatial placement of each atom in a transplanted plant root ball is difficult to predict, but, the plant will adapt its root ball to the hole, and continue to thrive. This conceptual expression harkens back to original statements of Newton, "Nature is pleased with simplicity", Dalton, "rule of greatest simplicity," and Einstein, "Nature is the realization of the simplest conceivable mathematical ideas."

In 1974 [[Rustum Roy]] and Olaf Müller noted simplexity in the structure of [[ternary compound]]s:
:By dealing with approximately ten ternary structural groupings we can cover the most important structures of science and technology specific to the non-metallics world. It is a remarkable instance of nature's 'simplexity'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rustum Roy]] &amp; Olaf Müller (1974) ''The Major Ternary Structural Families'', pages 3 &amp; 4,Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|9780387064307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, simplexity has been defined by Philippe Compain in the context of an article on the future of synthetic chemistry as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Simplexity may be defined as the combination of simplicity and complexity within the context of a dynamic relationship between means and ends.";&lt;ref name="Compain"&gt;[http://www.lactualitechimique.org/spip.php?numero_article437 Philippe Compain "The challenge of simplexity. The simple and the complex in organic synthesis" Act. Chim., 2003, 263-264, pages 129-134.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pCompain"&gt;[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2006/nj/b601837h#!divAbstract Philippe Compain et al. "Looking forward: a glance into the future of organic chemistry" New J. Chem., 2006, 30, pages 823-831.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The quest for simplicity constitutes indeed the basis for all future challenges of [[chemical synthesis]] including diversity, selectivity and [[green chemistry]]. Due to the almost infinity of molecules that could in theory be synthesized,&lt;ref name="Lipinski"&gt;A. Lipinski, F. Lombardo, B. W. Dominy, P. J. Feeney, Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001,46,3.&lt;/ref&gt; the focus of synthetic research has been shifted gradually from target-oriented synthesis to  diversity-oriented synthesis ([[divergent synthesis]]). A scientific approach based on the power of the molecular construction game and guided by an ideal for simplicity, has a high potential for discovery. The creative combination of synthetic methodologies, mixing simplicity and maximization of structural complexity, is indeed expected to be a powerful tool to produce unprecedented molecular structures with beneficial properties for mankind.

=== Interdisciplinary ===

Simplexity became the topic of formal discussion at the Hamburg Trend Day in Germany.  Among the formal contributors were [[Peter Wippermann]], Dr. [[Norbert Bolz]], [[David Bosshart]], Designer [[Ora Ito]], [[Markus Shepherd]], [[Susane Tide Frater]].

''Simplexity: Why Simple Things Become Complex (and How Complex Things Can Be Made Simple)'' by [[Jeffrey Kluger]] details many ways in which simplexity theory can be applied to multiple disciplines.  Kluger offers a look at simplexity at work in economics, sports, linguistics, technology, medicine, and dozens of human behaviors.  ''Simplexity'' also provides insight into how readers can improve their lives by understanding the interplay of complexity and simplicity.

Simplexity has been used by [[Jens Nordvig]] to describe the particular aim of his analytics firm Exante Data.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Maybe the best word for what we are trying to achieve is ''simplexity''. A research product that draws on a very complex analytical foundation, but is presented in a very simple and easy to digest manner. ... This concept of ''simplexity'' may be important in a much broader sense. The general idea of simplexity could be key to effectively service a growing community of so-called “quantmental” fund managers that use large amounts of data and modeling in their processes, while still applying a human touch in the final investment decisions. We think ''simplexity'' will be increasingly important to how we develop our overall research at Exante."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://exantedata.com/news/letter-simplexity-in-research|title=Letter: Simplexity in Research|last=|first=|date=|work=exante data|access-date=2018-05-03|publisher=Exante Data|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Social aspects ==
Professor [[Peter Wipperman]] proposed a social definition &lt;blockquote&gt;"We long for simplicity and satisfaction.  Simplexity therefore stands for a balance between the growing complexity of daily life and our own personal satisfaction.  In order to attain this state, we have to stop always striving to make optimal decisions.  In the future, it will be more important to make judgments that are just good enough."&lt;ref name="Wipperman"&gt;Wipperman, Peter. (year unknown).

For example, getting money from a bank machine. He describes how in between the chain of interfaces there is more room for error. More interfaces, more potential problems.

In [[mathematics]], a '''simplicial complex''' is a set composed of [[Point (geometry)|point]]s, [[line segment]]s, [[triangle]]s, and their [[Simplex|''n''-dimensional counterparts]] (see illustration).  Simplicial complexes should not be confused with the more abstract notion of a [[simplicial set]] appearing in modern simplicial [[homotopy theory]].  The purely combinatorial counterpart to a simplicial complex is an [[abstract simplicial complex]].

==Definitions==
A '''simplicial complex''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of [[Simplex|simplices]] that satisfies the following conditions:
:1. Every [[Simplex#Elements|face]] of a simplex from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; is also in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt;.
:2. The [[Set intersection|intersection]] of any two simplices &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1, \sigma_2 \in \mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; is a face of both &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the empty set is a face of every simplex.  See also the definition of an [[abstract simplicial complex]], which loosely speaking is a simplicial complex without an associated geometry.

A '''simplicial ''k''-complex''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; is a simplicial complex where the largest dimension of any simplex in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; equals ''k''.  For instance, a simplicial 2-complex must contain at least one triangle, and must not contain any tetrahedra or higher-dimensional simplices.

A '''pure''' or '''homogeneous''' simplicial ''k''-complex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; is a simplicial complex where every simplex of dimension less than ''k'' is a face of some simplex &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in \mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; of dimension exactly ''k''.  Informally, a pure 1-complex "looks" like it's made of a bunch of lines, a 2-complex "looks" like it's made of a bunch of triangles, etc.  An example of a ''non''-homogeneous complex is a triangle with a line segment attached to one of its vertices.

A '''facet''' is any simplex in a complex that is ''not'' a face of any larger simplex. (Note the difference from a "face" of a simplex). A pure simplicial complex can be thought of as a complex where all facets have the same dimension.

Sometimes the term ''face'' is used to refer to a simplex of a complex, not to be confused with a face of a simplex.

For a simplicial complex embedded in a ''k''-dimensional space, the ''k''-faces are sometimes referred to as its '''cells'''.  The term ''cell'' is sometimes used in a broader sense to denote a set [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a simplex, leading to the definition of [[cell complex]].

The '''underlying space''', sometimes called the '''carrier''' of a simplicial complex is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of its simplices.

==Closure, star, and link==
&lt;gallery class="center" widths=350 heights=112&gt;
File:Simplicial complex closure.svg|Two {{color|#fc3|simplices}} and their {{color|#093|'''closure'''}}.
File:Simplicial complex star.svg|A {{color|#fc3|vertex}} and its {{color|#093|'''star'''}}.
File:Simplicial complex link.svg|A {{color|#fc3|vertex}} and its {{color|#093|'''link'''}}.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Let ''K'' be a simplicial complex and let ''S'' be a collection of simplices in ''K''.

The '''closure''' of ''S'' (denoted Cl&amp;nbsp;''S'') is the smallest simplicial subcomplex of ''K'' that contains
each simplex  in ''S''.  Cl&amp;nbsp;''S'' is obtained by repeatedly adding to ''S'' each face of every simplex in ''S''.

The '''star''' of ''S'' (denoted St&amp;nbsp;''S'') is the union of the stars of each simplex in ''S''. For a single simplex ''s'', the star of ''s'' is the set of simplices having ''s'' as a face. (Note that the star of ''S'' is generally not a simplicial complex itself).

The '''link''' of ''S'' (denoted Lk&amp;nbsp;''S'') equals Cl&amp;nbsp;St&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;St&amp;nbsp;Cl&amp;nbsp;''S''.
It is the closed star of  ''S'' minus the stars of all faces of&amp;nbsp;''S''.

==Algebraic topology==
{{Main|Simplicial homology}}
In [[algebraic topology]], simplicial complexes are often useful for concrete calculations.  For the definition of [[homology group]]s of a simplicial complex, one can read the corresponding [[chain complex]] directly, provided that consistent orientations are made of all simplices.  The requirements of [[homotopy theory]] lead to the use of more general spaces, the [[CW complex]]es. Infinite complexes are a technical tool basic in algebraic topology.  See also the discussion at [[polytope]] of simplicial complexes as subspaces of Euclidean space, made up of subsets each of which is a [[simplex]]. That somewhat more concrete concept is there attributed to [[Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov|Alexandrov]]. Any finite simplicial complex in the sense talked about here can be embedded as a polytope in that sense, in some large number of dimensions. In algebraic topology a compact topological space which is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of a finite simplicial complex is usually called a [[polyhedron]] (see {{harvnb|Spanier|1966}}, {{harvnb|Maunder|1996}}, {{harvnb|Hilton|Wylie|1967}}).

==Combinatorics==
[[Combinatorics|Combinatorialists]] often study the '''''f''-vector''' of a simplicial d-complex Δ, which is the [[integer|integral]] sequence &lt;math&gt;(f_0,  f_1,  f_2,  \ldots,  f_{d+1})&lt;/math&gt;, where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of (''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional faces of Δ (by convention, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 unless Δ is the empty complex).  For instance, if Δ is the boundary of the [[octahedron]], then its ''f''-vector is (1, 6, 12, 8), and if Δ is the first simplicial complex pictured above, its ''f''-vector is (1, 18, 23, 8, 1).  A complete characterization of the possible ''f''-vectors of simplicial complexes is given by the [[Kruskal–Katona theorem]].

By using the ''f''-vector of a simplicial ''d''-complex Δ as coefficients of a [[polynomial]] (written in decreasing order of exponents), we obtain the '''f-polynomial''' of Δ.  In our two examples above, the ''f''-polynomials would be &lt;math&gt;x^3+6x^2+12x+8&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^4+18x^3+23x^2+8x+1&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

Combinatorists are often quite interested in the '''h-vector''' of a simplicial complex Δ, which is the sequence of coefficients of the polynomial that results from plugging ''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 into the ''f''-polynomial of Δ.  Formally, if we write ''F''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') to mean the ''f''-polynomial of Δ, then the '''h-polynomial''' of Δ is

:&lt;math&gt;F_\Delta(x-1)=h_0x^{d+1}+h_1x^d+h_2x^{d-1}+\cdots+h_dx+h_{d+1}&lt;/math&gt;

and the ''h''-vector of Δ is

:&lt;math&gt;(h_0,  h_1,  h_2, \cdots,  h_{d+1}).&lt;/math&gt;

We calculate the h-vector of the octahedron boundary (our first example) as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;F(x-1)=(x-1)^3+6(x-1)^2+12(x-1)+8=x^3+3x^2+3x+1.&lt;/math&gt;

So the ''h''-vector of the boundary of the octahedron is (1, 3, 3, 1).  It is not an accident this ''h''-vector is symmetric.  In fact, this happens whenever Δ is the boundary of a simplicial [[polytope]] (these are the [[Dehn–Sommerville equations]]).  In general, however, the ''h''-vector of a simplicial complex is not even necessarily positive.  For instance, if we take Δ to be the 2-complex given by two triangles intersecting only at a common vertex, the resulting ''h''-vector is (1, 3, −2).

A complete characterization of all simplicial polytope ''h''-vectors is given by the celebrated [[g-theorem]] of [[Richard P. Stanley|Stanley]], Billera, and Lee.

Simplicial complexes can be seen to have the same geometric structure as the [[contact graph]] of a sphere packing (a graph where vertices are the centers of spheres and edges exist if the corresponding packing elements touch each other) and as such can be used to determine the combinatorics of [[sphere packing]]s, such as the number of touching pairs (1-simplices), touching triplets (2-simplices), and touching quadruples (3-simplices) in a sphere packing.

If instead of the Helmholtz equation, the [[Laplace equation]] is solved in spheroidal coordinates using the method of separation of variables, the spheroidal wave functions reduce to the spheroidal harmonics. With oblate spheroidal coordinates, the solutions 
are called ''oblate harmonics'' and with prolate spheroidal coordinates, ''prolate harmonics''. Both type of spheroidal harmonics
are expressible in terms of [[Legendre functions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1881">The '''superposition calculus''' is a [[Formal system|calculus]] for [[automated theorem proving|reasoning]] in equational [[first-order logic]]. It was developed in the early 1990s  and combines concepts from [[first-order resolution]] with ordering-based equality handling as developed in the context of (unfailing) [[Knuth–Bendix completion algorithm|Knuth–Bendix completion]]. It can be seen as a generalization of either resolution (to equational logic) or unfailing completion (to full clausal logic). As most first-order calculi, superposition tries to show the ''unsatisfiability'' of a set of first-order [[clauses]], i.e. it performs proofs by [[refutation]]. Superposition is refutation-complete—given unlimited resources and a ''fair'' derivation strategy, from any [[unsatisfiable]] clause set a contradiction will eventually be derived.

As of 2007, most of the (state-of-the-art) [[Automated theorem prover|theorem prover]]s for [[first-order logic]] are based on superposition (e.g. the [[E equational theorem prover]]), although only a few implement the pure calculus.

'''''The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World''''' is a book by [[Pedro Domingos]] released in 2015. Domingos wrote the book in order to generate interest from people outside the field.

The book outlines five tribes of machine learning: [[inductive reasoning]], [[connectionism]], [[evolutionary computation]], [[Bayes' theorem|bayes theorem]] and [[Analogical modeling|analogical modelling]]. The author explains these tribes to the reader by referring to more understandable processes of [[logic]], connections made in the [[brain]], [[natural selection]], [[probability]] and [[Similarity (psychology)|similarity]] judgements. Throughout the book, it is suggested that each different tribe has the potential to contribute to a unifying "master algorithm".

Towards the end of the book the author pictures a "master [[algorithm]]" in the near future, where [[machine learning algorithm]]s asymptotically grow to a perfect understanding of how the world and people in it work.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Slate.com_September_26_2015c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/09/pedro_domingos_master_algorithm_how_machine_learning_is_reshaping_how_we.2.html|title=Pedro Domingos' Master Algorithm: How machine learning is reshaping how we live.|author=|date=|accessdate=September 26, 2015|newspaper=Slate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the algorithm doesn't yet exist, he briefly reviews his own invention of the [[Markov logic network]].&lt;ref name="Dom2015"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Master Algorithm: How machine learning is reshaping how we live.|last=Domingos|first=Pedro|date=2015|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=246–7.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A computer science educator stated in ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' that the examples are clear and accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World, by Pedro Domingos|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/review-the-master-algorithm-pedro-domingos-allen-lane|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|date=17 September 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''[[The Economist]]'' agreed Domingo "does a good job" but complained that he "constantly invents metaphors that grate or confuse".&lt;ref&gt;"Machines for thinking: artificial intelligence." The Economist, 3 Oct. 2015, p. 86(US).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' praised the book, stating "Readers unfamiliar with logic and computer theory will have a difficult time, but those who persist will discover fascinating insights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE MASTER ALGORITHM by Pedro Domingos {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/pedro-domingos/the-master-algorithm/|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=2015|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New Scientist]]'' review called it "compelling but rather unquestioning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=&lt;em&gt;The Master Algorithm&lt;/em&gt;: A world remade by machines that learn|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22830450-900-the-master-algorithm-a-world-remade-by-machines-that-learn/|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=New Scientist|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]] a '''trigonal bipyramid''' formation is a [[molecular geometry]] with one atom at the center and 5 more atoms at the corners of a [[triangular bipyramid]]. This is one geometry for which the bond angles surrounding the central atom are not identical (see also [[pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry|pentagonal bipyramid]]), because there is no geometrical arrangement with five terminal atoms in equivalent positions. Examples of this molecular geometry are [[phosphorus pentafluoride]] (PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[phosphorus pentachloride]] (PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) in the gas phase.&lt;ref name="Housecroft"&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axial (or apical) and equatorial positions==
[[File:Trigonal-bipyramidal-3D-balls-ax-eq.png|thumb|left|200px|Trigonal bipyramidal molecular shape&lt;br /&gt;'''ax''' = axial ligand (on unique axis)&lt;br /&gt;'''eq''' = equatorial ligand (in plane perpendicular to unique axis)]]
The five atoms bonded to the central atom are not all equivalent, and two different types of position are defined. For [[phosphorus pentachloride]] as an example, the phosphorus atom shares a plane with three chlorine atoms at 120° angles to each other in ''equatorial'' positions, and two more chlorine atoms above and below the plane (''axial'' or ''apical'' positions).

According to the [[VSEPR theory]] of molecular geometry, an axial position is more crowded because an axial atom has three neighboring equatorial atoms (on the same central atom) at a 90° bond angle, whereas an equatorial atom has only two neighboring axial atoms at a 90° bond angle. For molecules with five identical ligands, the axial bond lengths tend to be longer because the ligand atom cannot approach the central atom as closely. As examples, in PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; the axial P−F bond length is 158&amp;nbsp;[[picometre|pm]] and the equatorial is 152&amp;nbsp;pm, and in PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; the axial and equatorial are 214 and 202&amp;nbsp;pm respectively.&lt;ref name="Housecroft"/&gt;

In the mixed halide PF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the chlorines occupy two of the equatorial positions,&lt;ref name="Housecroft"/&gt; indicating that fluorine has a greater [[apicophilicity]] or tendency to occupy an axial position. In general ligand apicophilicity increases with [[electronegativity]] and also with pi-electron withdrawing ability, as in the sequence Cl&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;F&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;CN.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=AT06990|title=Apicophilicity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both factors decrease electron density in the bonding region near the central atom so that crowding in the axial position is less important.

==Related geometries with lone pairs==
The VSEPR theory also predicts that substitution of a ligand at a central atom by a lone pair of valence electrons leaves the general form of the electron arrangement unchanged with the lone pair now occupying one position. For molecules with five pairs of valence electrons including both bonding pairs and lone pairs, the electron pairs are still arranged in a trigonal bipyramid but one or more equatorial positions is not attached to a ligand atom so that the molecular geometry (for the nuclei only) is different.

The [[seesaw molecular geometry]] is found in [[sulfur tetrafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) with a central sulfur atom surrounded by four fluorines occupying two axial and two equatorial positions, as well as one equatorial lone pair, corresponding to an AX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;E molecule in the [[VSEPR theory#AXE method|AXE notation]]. A [[T-shaped molecular geometry]] is found in [[chlorine trifluoride]] (ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), an AX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule with fluorines in two axial and one equatorial position, as well as two equatorial lone pairs. Finally, the [[triiodide]] ion ({{Chem|I|3|-}}) is also based upon a trigonal bipyramid, but the actual molecular geometry is [[Linear molecular geometry|linear]] with terminal iodines in the two axial positions only and the three equatorial positions filled with lone pairs of electrons (AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Berry pseudorotation==
Isomers with a trigonal bipyramidal geometry are able to interconvert through a process known as [[Berry mechanism|Berry pseudorotation]]. Pseudorotation is similar in concept to the movement of a conformational diastereomer, though no full revolutions are completed. In the process of pseudorotation, two equatorial ligands (both of which have a shorter bond length than the third) "shift" toward the molecule's axis, while the axial ligands simultaneously "shift" toward the equator, creating a constant cyclical movement. Pseudorotation is particularly notable in simple molecules such as [[phosphorus pentafluoride]] (PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;).

A '''vinculum''' is a horizontal line used in [[mathematical notation]] for a specific purpose. It may be placed as an [[overline]] (or [[underline]]) over  (or under) a [[mathematical expression]] to indicate that the expression is to be considered grouped together. Historically, vincula were extensively used to group items together, especially in written mathematics, but in modern mathematics this function has almost entirely been replaced by the use of [[parentheses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Florian|last=Cajori|title=A History of Mathematical Notations|volume=I|year=2012|origyear=1928|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-67766-8|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, however, the common usage of a vinculum to indicate the repetend of a [[repeating decimal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lindsay N.|last=Childs|title=A Concrete Introduction to Higher Algebra|edition=3rd|publisher=Springer|year=2009|pages=183-188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conférence Intercantonale de l'Instruction Publique de la Suisse Romande et du Tessin|title=Aide-mémoire|series=Mathématiques 9-10-11|publisher=LEP|year=2011|pages=20-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a significant exception and reflects the original usage.

''Vinculum'' is [[Latin]] for "bond", "fetter", "chain", or "tie", which is suggestive of some of the uses of the symbol.

==Usage==
A vinculum can indicate a [[line segment]] where ''A'' and ''B'' are the endpoints:
*&lt;math&gt;\overline{\rm AB}.&lt;/math&gt;

A vinculum can indicate the repetend of a [[repeating decimal]] value:
*{{frac|1|7}} = 0.{{overline|142857}} = 0.1428571428571428571...

Similarly, it is used to show the repeating terms in a periodic continued fraction. [[Quadratic irrational]] numbers are the only numbers that have these.

Its main use was as a notation to indicate a group (a bracketing device serving the same function as parentheses):

:&lt;math&gt;(a-\overline{b+c}),&lt;/math&gt;

meaning to add ''b'' and ''c'' first and then subtract the result from ''a'', which would be written more commonly today as {{math|''a'' − (''b'' + ''c'')}}. Parentheses, used for grouping, are only rarely found in the mathematical literature before the eighteenth century. The vinculum was used extensively, usually as an overline, but [[Nicolas Chuquet|Chuquet]] in 1484 used the underline version.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|2012|pages=390–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vinculum is used as part of the notation of a [[Radical symbol|radical]] to indicate the [[radicand]] whose [[Nth root|root]] is being indicated.  In the following, the quantity &lt;math&gt;ab+2&lt;/math&gt; is the whole radicand, and thus has a vinculum over it:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{ab+2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In 1637 [[Renee Descartes|Descartes]] was the first to unite the German radical sign √ with the vinculum to create the radical symbol in common use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|2012|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol used to indicate a vinculum need not be a line segment (overline or underline); sometimes braces can be used (pointing either up or down).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jacob|last=Abbott|title=Vulgar and decimal fractions (The Mount Vernon Arithmetic Part II)|year=1847|origyear=1847|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other notations==

There are several mathematical notations which use an overbar that can easily be mistaken for a vinculum. Among these are:

It can be used in [[signed-digit representation]] to represent negative digits, such as the following example in [[balanced ternary]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi \approx 10.011\overline{1}111\overline{1}000\overline{1}011\overline{1}1101\overline/11111100\overline{1}0000\overline{1}1\overline{1}\overline{1}\overline{1}\overline{1}0\overline{1}&lt;/math&gt;

or the ''bar'' notation in [[common logarithm]]s, such as

:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10} 0.2 \approx \bar{1}.301 = -1 + 0.301 = -0.699&lt;/math&gt;

The overbar is sometimes used in [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], where it serves to indicate a group of expressions whose logical result is to be [[negation|negated]], as in:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[electronics]], the overbar is used to notate complementary binary signals. For example, {{Overline|READY}} pronounced "not ready", would be the same signal as READY but with the opposite polarity. This usage is closely related to the usage in Boolean algebra.

It is also used to refer to the [[Complex number#Conjugate|conjugate of a complex number]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{z} = \overline{x+iy} = {x-iy}.&lt;/math&gt;

In statistics the overbar can be used to indicate the mean of series of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Statistics made Simple |edition=2nd |first=H. T. |last=Hayslett |first2=P. |last2=Murphy |publisher=W. H. Allen and Co |year=1968 |page=18 |isbn=0-491-00680-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particle physics, the overline is used to indicate [[antiparticle]]s. For example, p and {{Overline|p}} are the symbols for proton and antiproton, respectively.

Though similar, a horizontal fractional line is not considered a vinculum. The vinculum should also not be confused with a similar-looking [[vector (geometric)|vector]] notation, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{AB}&lt;/math&gt; "vector from A to B", or  &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; "vector named ''a''", though an overline or underline without the arrowhead is sometimes used instead (e.g., &lt;math&gt;\overline{a}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\underline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;).

==Roman numerals==

It has been stated that in [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] notation, a vinculum may indicate that the numerals under the line represented a thousand times the unmodified value.&lt;ref name="Ifrah2000"&gt;{{Cite book| author= Georges Ifrah| title = The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer | others = Translated by David Bellos, E. F. Harding, Sophie Wood, Ian Monk | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathematical historian [[David Eugene Smith]] disputes this.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David Eugene|last=Smith|title=History of Mathematics|volume=II|year=1958|origyear=1925|isbn=0-486-20430-8|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The notation was certainly in use in the Middle Ages.

==Computer entry of the symbol==

The vinculum can be formed in [[Unicode]] by using the combining overline ([[Unicode|U+]]0305) after the character that one wishes to add it to. For example, typing "33.333..." with combining overlines over the final three "3"s produces: "33.3̅3̅3̅...".

In [[HTML]] code, the vinculum can be generated over any given character or run of characters by using the [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] rule &lt;code&gt;text-decoration: overline&lt;/code&gt;. However, this does not carry over when pasting into a [[plain text]] [[Text editor|editor]], because CSS affects format, not content.

Word processors frequently have an overbar option. In [[Microsoft Word]], this can be achieved through the [[Microsoft Equation Editor|Equation Editor]] or, in the [[Microsoft Word 2007|2007 and later versions]], the built-in equation editing feature. On a Mac using [[Pages (word processor)|Pages]], the Unicode Hex keyboard may have to be installed first, in System Preferences|Keyboard. Open the Word Processor and make sure the Unicode keyboard is active. Type the first number to be overbarred, then ALT 0305, then the second number, then ALT 0305, and so on. 

In [[LaTeX]], &lt;code&gt;33.\overline{888}&lt;/code&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;33.\overline{888}&lt;/math&gt;.
