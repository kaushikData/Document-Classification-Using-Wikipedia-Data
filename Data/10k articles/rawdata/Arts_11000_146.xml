== Controversies ==

Alexander McQueen first caused controversy with his Spring/Summer 1995 collection which featured his signature "bumster trousers". At the time, the trousers were described as indecent as they barely covered the natural downward curve of the buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashion.ukfirst.com/A%20Cut%20Below%20the%20Waist/BelowTheWaist.html |title=Below the Waist |publisher=Fashion.ukfirst.com |accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this by entitling his Autumn/Winter 1995 collection ''Highland Rape'' which he explained was about the "rape" of Scotland by the English, a subject that had a personal resonance as his family is of Scottish descent.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/mcqueen_a.html |title=&gt;&gt; arts &gt;&gt; McQueen, Alexander |publisher=glbtq |date=17 March 1969 |accessdate=6 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215194353/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/mcqueen_a.html |archivedate=15 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection featured tattered dresses made of scraps of tartan and chiffon and a tampon-strewn skirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/12/alexander-mcqueen-fashion-feminism-obituary-opinions-contributors-raquel-laneri.html |title=His Dark Materials |work=Forbes |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=6 November 2010 |first=Raquel |last=Laneri |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031005215/http://www.forbes.com/2010/02/12/alexander-mcqueen-fashion-feminism-obituary-opinions-contributors-raquel-laneri.html |archivedate=31 October 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Alexander McQueen photographed [[Aimee Mullins]] and sent her down the catwalk with intricately carved wooden legs – making her the first amputee to ever be featured on the catwalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/may/25/features.magazine87 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Dee | last=O'Connell | title=What happened next? | date=25 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the untitled Spring/Summer 1999 catwalk show, [[Shalom Harlow]]'s white cotton dress was sprayed by car robots as she was spun around a platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703382904575059654022817776 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=William | last=Lyons | title=Shock, Controversy and Beauty | date=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal rights activists and heavy police presence due to a reported bomb scare were present at the Autumn/Winter 2000 ''Eshu'' catwalk show, due to the extensive use of fur and leather in the collection.&lt;ref name="widemedia.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.widemedia.com/fashionuk/fashion/catwalk-archive/lfw-aw00/mq.html |title=fashionUK &gt;&gt; london fashion week a/w 2000–2001 &gt;&gt; Alexander McQueen |publisher=Widemedia.com |accessdate=6 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718043226/http://www.widemedia.com/fashionuk/fashion/catwalk-archive/lfw-aw00/mq.html |archive-date=18 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, costume designer Jany Temime was exposed for copying a dress from the Autumn/Winter 2008 collection ''The Girl Who Lived in the Tree'', for her work on ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang |first=Connie |url=http://www.refinery29.com/did-the-designer-harry-potter-steal-designs-from-alexander-mcqueen.php |title=Harry Potter Steals Alexander McQueen Designs |publisher=Refinery29.com |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=6 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101107172801/http://www.refinery29.com/did-the-designer-harry-potter-steal-designs-from-alexander-mcqueen.php| archivedate= 7 November 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temime had claimed that she "wanted it to be a witch wedding dress but not a Halloween dress. The dress is white but it needed to have something fantastic to it. So there is the phoenix [motif], the bird, which is a symbol of love in a way because there is rebirth, love never dies, it is born again." However, the birds on the McQueen original were actually peacocks, and although Temime did manage to change the crest on the bird's heads to make them more 'phoenixy', she neglected to alter any other detail of the birds, including their rather obvious peacock feathers.

'''Armand Nicolet''' is a Swiss luxury watch manufacturer located in [[Tramelan]], a mountain village in the [[Bernese Jura]]. Its history dates to its foundation in 1875.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.armandnicolet.com/history/|title=History, the swiss watches collections - Armand Nicolet|work=Armand Nicolet|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.horbiter.com/en/armand-nicolet-hs2-2017-watch-hands-on/|title=Armand Nicolet HS2 - Horbiter|last=System|first=Helmet Digital|website=Horbiter|language=en|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Armand Nicolet, the son of a [[watchmaker]], set us his own ''Atelier d'Horlogerie'' in 1875, having successfully completed an excellent [[apprenticeship]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wristwatchreview.co.uk/brand-armand-nicolet|title=About the Brand – Armand Nicolet|last=|first=|date=|work=Wristwatch Review UK|access-date=2017-11-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masterhorologer.com/2008/01/armand-nicolet.html|title=Armand Nicolet Watches: Brand Profile , History and Products|website=www.masterhorologer.com|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1902, the Atelier was producing [[pocket watch]]es with grand [[Complication (horology)|complications]], such as a piece that consisted of a [[guilloché]] rose gold case, enamel dial, monopusher [[chronograph]], complete calendar (date, day, month and moonphase indication), [[Repeater (horology)|repeating hours, quarter hours and minutes]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Examples of these historically significant pieces can be seen in the Armand Nicolet museum located in [[Tramelan]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Armand Nicolet died in 1939 and his son, Willy Nicolet, took control of the company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under Willy's control, Armand Nicolet was developed into the largest T1 watchmaker, whose decorated, finely set and assembled mechanical movement components produced finished movements in the region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.armandnicolet.com/process/|title=The Process - Armand Nicolet|last=|first=|date=|work=Armand Nicolet|access-date=2017-11-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s, the entire Swiss watch industry entered difficult times, due to the influx of quartz timekeeping, a period known as the [[quartz crisis]]. Throughout these years, many storied Swiss watchmakers closed their doors, and the industry dramatically shrunk in size, due to its reliance on mechanical movements and its slow adoption of quartz technology. Armand Nicolet did not fold during these difficult times, and kept the doors open by working with some of the most important companies in the industry, thanks to the reputation they had built up as an excellent watchmaker.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, they were left with a large stock of mechanical movements and no one to assemble them for.

In 1987, Willy met Rolando Braga, an Italian watch enthusiast working in the watchmaking industry, and this started a new direction for Armand Nicolet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Beatriz Michelena''' (February 22, 1890 &amp;ndash; October 10, 1942) was an [[Americans|American]] [[actress]] and singer during the [[silent film]] era, known at the time for her operatic soprano voice and appearances in [[musical theatre]]. She was one of the few [[Latino|Latina]] stars visible on the silver screen in the United States in the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Latinas in the United States |last1=Ruiz |first1=Vicki |last2=Korrol |first2=Virginia Sánchez  |year=2006 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn= |page=498 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_62IjQ-XQScC&amp;pg=PA498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a leading lady in each film project she was involved in, and co-founded a production company with her husband, producing four of her own movies.

She wrote popular articles for newspapers, including an advice column for girls, describing what it was like to be an actress, and answering questions from readers. For adult readers, Michelena wrote other pieces such as a history of the moving picture industry. In 1920 when she stopped making films, she returned to her career as a singer.

Michelena faded from historiography for many years,&lt;ref name=Fregoso2003&gt;{{cite book |title=meXicana Encounters: The Making of Social Identities on the Borderlands |last=Fregoso |first=Rosa Linda |year=2003 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-22997-5 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2zy-l5Va2EC&amp;pg=PA105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but her place in history has recently been re-examined; she was mentioned in 2002 in a presidential proclamation and her 1914 film ''[[Salomy Jane (1914 film)|Salomy Jane]]'' enjoyed a limited re-release in 2008.&lt;ref name="California Film Institute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cafilm.org/rfc/events/946.html |publisher=California Film Institute |title=Salomy Jane: Introduced by historians David Kiehn and William Sagar, Piano Accompaniment by Bruce Loeb |date=September 27, 2008 |accessdate=April 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725041105/http://www.cafilm.org/rfc/events/946.html |archive-date=2011-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:BeatrizMichelena1901-crop.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Michelena with the Princess Chic Opera Co., ca. 1901]]
Beatriz Michelena was reportedly born in [[New York City]] in 1890, six years after her sister [[Vera Michelena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0584960/ |publisher=Internet Movie Database |title=Vera Michelena bio |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a noted tenor [[Fernando Michelena]] (1858–1921), whose parents were [[Spaniards|Spanish]]; settled in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]] where he was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MJ19210310.2.32 California Digital Newspaper Collection] Marin Journal, Volume 60, Number 10, 10 March 1921&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.louisville.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/macauley&amp;CISOPTR=1107&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=2 |publisher=University of Louisville |work=Libraries: Digital Collections |title=Fernando Michelena, photograph by Theodore C. Marceau |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1930Census&gt;1930; Census Place: San Rafael, Marin, California; Roll: 176; Page: 10A; Enumeration District: 0020; Image: 981.0; FHL microfilm: 2339911.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1920; Census Place: San Rafael, Marin, California; Roll: T625_120; Page: 13B; Enumeration District: 94; Image: 939.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother [[Frances Lenord]] (1867–1912), was an operatic soprano and pianist.

Over much of her childhood, Michelena’s parents toured with the [[Emma Abbott|Emma Abbott Grand Opera Company]] a traveling theatre company that performed famous operas translated to English for American audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Abbott Grand Opera Company (advertisement). ''St. Louis Globe-Democrat, '' November 01, 1885; p. 12, col. B&lt;/ref&gt; Beatriz's father in later life taught music and worked as a vocal coach and, at the time of his death, was serving as president of Arrillaga Musical College, San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Arrillaga Musical College Advertisement. ''Oakland Tribune'', August 1, 1920, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Beatriz and her sister Vera were trained by their father in classical voice and drama studies, and they followed in his footsteps by beginning singing careers of their own. Vera first appeared onstage in the Princess Chic Opera company (1901) at 17, taking a leading role in ''The Man from China'' (1904).&lt;ref name=May1904&gt;{{cite book |title=Everybody's Magazine |date=May 1904 |publisher=The Ridgway-Thayer Company |location=New York |page=679 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIk8AAAAIAA&amp;pg=PA679 |accessdate=April 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatriz, too, performed with Princess Chic in 1901, taking chorus roles suitable for a child of 11. By mid-1904, with Vera busy pursuing her career in New York, Fernando Michelena settled in [[San Francisco, California]] to teach voice.&lt;ref name=May1904/&gt; There, he raised Beatriz and continued to train her, a soprano, in operatic vocal techniques.&lt;ref name=Fregoso2003/&gt; He passed his stage experience to his daughter: the way to move as another person, the way to make simple but authoritative gestures, and the way to build intensity over the span of a performance.&lt;ref name=Bell78&gt;Bell, 1984, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Antonia Field, a Californian writer, would later chronicle her time as a student of Michelena’s father in her book, ''Five Years of Vocal Study under Fernando Michelena''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/fiveyearsofvocal00fielrich  Field, Maria Antonia.

==Marriage and stage career==
On Sunday, March 3, 1907, Michelena married George E. Middleton, a prominent San Francisco automobile dealer, the "happy culmination" of a romance that had begun in their school days.&lt;ref name="Middleton Weds Michelena"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1907-03-04/ed-1/seq-7/;words=Middleton+Michelena |title=Marriage Comes as Sequel to Romance of School Days: George E. Middleton Weds Miss Michelena |page=7 |date=March 4, 1907 |work=The San Francisco Call |accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private wedding took place at 232 Divisadero Street, the home of the parents of bridesmaid Margaret McGovern, "a lifelong friend of the bride".&lt;ref name="Middleton Weds Michelena"/&gt; Judge Thomas F. Graham performed the ceremony. The couple spent a few weeks in Los Angeles for their honeymoon.&lt;ref name="Middleton Weds Michelena"/&gt;

Middleton was the manager of the local Middleton Motor Car Company and the son of a California timber baron. He introduced Michelena to his society friends and business partners, including the trustees of [[Charles Crocker]]'s estate who had rebuilt the [[Westin St. Francis|St. Francis Hotel]] after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake and fire]].&lt;ref name="PacSun2008"/&gt;

[[File:BeatrizMichelena 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|Michelena in 1910]]
After two years spent absent from the stage, in October 1910, "Beatriz Michelena Middleton" received a "full ovation" at the Garrick Theater for her role in ''The White Hen'', a musical comedy set in Austria. Rotund comedian [[Max Dill]], leader of the acting company, was the star of the show, given 14 minutes of applause upon entering the stage. For her performance, Michelena was sent flowers worth "a small fortune", according to the ''[[San Francisco Call]]''{{'s}} theater writer, [[Walter Anthony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1910-10-27/ed-1/seq-7/;words=Michelena+Beatriz |title=Noted Trio Has Powerful Play |page=7 |date=October 27, 1910 |work=The San Francisco Call |accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starring actress Lora Lieb, native to San Francisco but unknown as a performer, took less applause.

Middleton and Michelena gave an interview to Anthony after ''The White Hen'' was an established hit. Middleton said that he had kept his wife off the stage, that he "didn't like the idea of musical comedy", but would not have objected to her appearance in "grand opera".&lt;ref name=MaxDillStars&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1910-10-30/ed-1/seq-39/;words=Michelena+Beatriz |title=Max Dill and His Stars |page=39 |date=October 30, 1910 |work=The San Francisco Call |accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he agreed to an offer from Max Dill. Michelena said that she had so far spent her married life studying to perform three operatic roles: Carmen and Micaëla in ''[[Carmen]]'', and Violetta Valéry in ''[[La traviata]]''.&lt;ref name=MaxDillStars/&gt; She said that prior to appearing at the Garrick Theater, she had been afraid that her stage training had been lost.&lt;ref name=MaxDillStars/&gt; Michelena said she had to overcome her own fears as well as her husband's objections.&lt;ref name=MaxDillStars/&gt;

At the end of November, Michelena quit Dill's company, reporting that she had been billed underneath Lora Lieb in theater publicity, against the arrangement she had made with company manager Nat A. Magner. She said she refused to put her famous family name in second place.&lt;ref name=ActressQuits&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1910-12-01/ed-1/seq-1/ |title=Actress Quits After Quarrel Over Publicity: Beatriz Middleton Balks at Playing 'Second Fiddle' to Lora Lieb |pages=1–2 |date=December 1, 1910 |work=The San Francisco Call |accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 1910, a story in the ''Call'' talked about Michelena and her sister having been "discovered" seven years previously by John Slocum, the manager who worked with the girls in the Princess Chic company.&lt;ref name="SFCall-1910"/&gt; According to the story, Slocum had been trying to get Michelena to sign a long-term contract, but was beaten out in that regard by Middleton, "the athlete and clubman about town", whom she had married.&lt;ref name="SFCall-1910"&gt;{{cite news |title=Singer Migrates Back to Opera: Beatriz Michelena-Middleton to Appear for Three Nights in "The Kissing Girl" |publisher=San Francisco Call |page=7 |date=December 6, 1910 |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1910-12-06/ed-1/seq-7/ |accessdate=April 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A week earlier, Michelena had "caused a sensation" by resigning from the Max Dill company, but subsequently agreed to appear for four performances in Slocum's traveling production of ''The Kissing Girl'', normally featuring Michelena's good friend, the actress [[Texas Guinan]], who was willing to step down for a few days while Michelena covered the starring role of Christina. Michelena was quoted as saying,
{{blockquote|"Leo Cooper, seven years ago, insisted that Mr. Slocum should hear two youngsters sing. The youngsters were Vera and myself. He was good enough to have confidence in us and gave us positions in his 'Princess Chic' company, where we rose afterward, through his encouragement and help, to prima donna posts. In memory of these kindnesses of the past and because I love the work, I have been happy to say 'yes' to his request that I appear with his company a few times for auld lang syne before 'The Kissing Girl' goes on her osculatory way."&lt;ref name="SFCall-1910"/&gt;}}

Following the three performances in San Francisco and one in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], Michelena and her husband took seats in the audience to watch Guinan perform the play's title role in [[San Jose, California|San Jose's]] Victory Theater on December 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&amp;dat=19101216&amp;id=a-sxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O-MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3514,6292514 |title=Small Audience Sees a Good Show in "The Kissing Girl" at the Victory Last Night |date=December 16, 1910 |work=The Evening News |page=2|accessdate=April 14, 2010|location=San Jose, California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelena excelled in a singing role in [[Tik-Tok of Oz|''The Tik-Tok Man of Oz'']] in 1913. That year, during the autumn season, Michelena was a featured star of the Mechanics' Fair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z_oxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=POQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1889,1781394&amp;dq=beatriz+michelena&amp;hl=en |title=Mechanics' Fair |date=October 4, 1913 |work=Berkeley Daily Gazette |publisher=Google News |page=2 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; an engineering and [[auto show]] in San Francisco. Following that, she sang at the inauguration of the [[Lincoln Highway]], the nation's first transcontinental road.

Middleton set up the California Motion Picture Company (CMPC) in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] in 1912 for the purpose of shooting promotional footage of the automobiles he was selling.&lt;ref name="PacSun2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pacificsun.com/story.php?story_id=2409 |publisher=Pacific Sun |date=September 26, 2008 |first=Jason |last=Walsh |title=Salomy's last dance: A flashback to Marin's century-old quest for cinematic superstardom |accessdate=April 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719064046/http://www.pacificsun.com/story.php?story_id=2409 |archive-date=2011-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He determined that his pretty wife could star in movies made by his company. By 1914, Middleton and Michelena were making three major films at the same time.

[[File:SalomyJane-1914.jpg|thumb|During the shooting of ''[[Salomy Jane (1914 film)|Salomy Jane]]'', Michelena posed for a publicity still with leading man [[House Peters]].]]
The first [[feature film|feature]] completed by CMPC was [[Salomy Jane (1914 film)|''Salomy Jane'']], screened initially at the St. Francis Hotel by invitation only. Michelena's role was [[Bret Harte]]'s Salomy Jane Clay, an energetic daughter of an emigrant miner. She is wooed by four men but prefers a fifth played by British heartthrob [[House Peters]]. The movie saw limited nationwide distribution and was judged a hit by viewers who were impressed by the wild California scenery: giant [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood trees]], winding roads hugging rocky bluffs and the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]]  Michelena's dominant portrayal of the title role was also an appeal.&lt;ref name="McCracken1915"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgANAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA487 |title=Bret Harte in "The Movies" |last=McCracken |first=Josephine Clifford |authorlink=Josephine Clifford McCracken |date=June 1915 |work=Overland Monthly |pages=487–497 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Josephine Clifford McCracken]] wrote of her in the June 1915 issue of ''[[Overland Monthly]]'':
{{blockquote|"Daughter of a renowned tenor of San Francisco's pioneer days, herself a prima donna with an assured place on the modern operatic stage, a girl with a wealth of artistic tradition behind her, Miss Michelena's gifts do not stop there. She has rare beauty, vivacity, wit, intellectual attainments and athletic grace."&lt;ref name="McCracken1915"/&gt;}}

[[File:LilyPovertyFlat-1915.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|left|Michelena and actor Andrew Robson in ''The Lily of Poverty Flat'']]
One CMPC shooting location was on family property near [[Boulder Creek, California]] where Middleton's father had established a timber holding now known as the [[Middleton Tract, California|Middleton Tract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Marin Independent Journal |date=May 29, 1962 |title=William H. Middleton, 82 }} (Obituary for brother of George E. Middleton)&lt;/ref&gt; Other filming locations included undeveloped portions of Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Marin counties. In San Rafael, the studio boasted a large glass-walled and -roofed building that let in light but not wind so that shooting for indoor scenes could take place in full light without the telltale flapping of tablecloths and clothing blown by gusts. Considered expensive at the time, the company used a {{US$}}1,250 Bell &amp; Howell movie camera, worth about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1250|1915|r=-2}}}} in current value.&lt;ref name=Leonard1915&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.santacruzpl.org/history/articles/newspapers/223/ |work=Santa Cruz Daily Surf |date=February 16, 1915 |first=James P. |last=Leonard |title=The Lily of Poverty Flat: A Visit to Mimic Pioneer Village Where Movies Are Being Made |accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camera held two reels of film so that two [[Negative (photography)|negatives]] were made of each scene. A second $700 camera provided a third reel of the same scene, from another perspective.&lt;ref name=Leonard1915/&gt;

Even though ''Salomy Jane'' didn't return a profit (likely due to second-string distribution channels), its favorable reception convinced Middleton that his wife could challenge the world's top [[movie star]], [[Mary Pickford]].&lt;ref name="PacSun2008"/&gt; Every CMPC movie was from that time forward intended to be a star vehicle for Michelena. Unfortunately, Michelena's ego expanded with the glowing reviews of her skill, and her demands for star treatment brought heavier expenses to productions that continued to lose money. ''Mignon'', ''The Lily of Poverty Flat'', ''A Phyllis of the Sierras'', ''Salvation Nell'' and ''The Rose of the Misty Pool'' all failed to turn a profit, and a lavish production of ''Faust'' which was in production in 1915 was given until the end of the year to be completed. ''Faust'' wasn't done by January 1916, and CMPC president Herbert Payne shut the film company down and filed for bankruptcy. ''Faust'' was never released.&lt;ref name="PacSun2008"/&gt;

[[File:BeatrizMichelenaMasthead.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Michelena's newspaper column photo]]
In 1915 and 1916, Michelena wrote the regular newspaper column "Talks with Screen-struck Girls", carried at first by the ''San Rafael Independent'' on Tuesdays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catalog of copyright entries, Part 1 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |year=1916 |volume=13 |page=187 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzrQAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but then appeared on Sundays in other newspapers: ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|San Francisco Examiner]]'' and the ''Prescott Journal-Miner'' (Arizona). She wrote about the ideal qualities found in an actress, and what girls might do to develop them. She received a torrent of letters from readers—many were from girls asking "Must I be able to ride" and "Must I be able to swim".&lt;ref name="Michelena-May1916"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-XQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wFADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5594,443377&amp;dq=beatriz+michelena&amp;hl=en |title=Talks with Screen-struck Girls |last=Michelena |first=Beatriz |date=May 14, 1916 |work=Prescott Journal-Miner |page=2 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Michelena described in the column how those skills were helpful to a movie actress, but not absolutely necessary; she said they ''"are accessories to, rather than the substance of the thing&amp;nbsp;... I would advise every girl entering motion pictures to learn to ride and swim and do all the rest of it, but I would have her realize their subordination to the really artistic side of the profession."''''''&lt;ref name="Michelena-May1916"/&gt;

On May 7, 1916, Michelena wrote to caution girls wishing for fame on the silver screen that many like themselves ended up "broken in spirit", with shattered expectations.&lt;ref name=Barbas68/&gt; She advised them to stay home and avoid "bitter disappointment" in movie making.&lt;ref name=Barbas68&gt;{{cite book |title=Movie Crazy: Fans, Stars, and the Cult of Celebrity |last=Barbas |first=Samantha |year=2002 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=1-4039-6045-3 |pages=68, 197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f4beond0wMwC&amp;pg=PA68 |accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, she discussed some of the specifics of the mental challenges of acting:

{{blockquote|''"There are a hundred little peculiarities that index the character of practically every type of person, and it is the effectiveness with which one grasps, understands and utilizes these peculiarities that makes him or her a great dramatic artist&amp;nbsp;... The truly great actress&amp;nbsp;... must not only recognize the traits as she sees them outwardly manifested, but she must also get beneath the skin and recognize the conditions of thought or emotion that give rise to them. Then, and this is the really great test of her talents, she must so lose herself in those conditions of thought and emotion, and feel through them, that her mimicry of their outward manifestations comes naturally and without conscious endeavor."''&lt;ref name="Michelena-July1916"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JnUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wFADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5666,2921025&amp;dq=beatriz+michelena&amp;hl=en |title=Talks with Screen-struck Girls |last=Michelena |first=Beatriz |date=July 23, 1916 |work=Prescott Journal-Miner |page=2 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to her column, Michelena wrote occasional articles intended for a wider readership. She wrote in October 1916 about the history of the moving picture industry in a multiple-article series, beginning her account with a retelling of [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s action photograph of Governor [[Leland Stanford]]'s racehorse named Occident. She defined this high-speed image as essential to the development of moving pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ylcgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M9QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2445,4821170&amp;dq=beatriz+michelena&amp;hl=en |title=History of Motion Picture Industry |last=Michelena |first=Beatriz |date=October 7, 1916 |work=Quebec Telegraph |page=40 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michelena Studios==
[[File:Beatriz Michelena M.J. Moriarty Playing Card.jpg|thumb|upright|Michelena on a playing card]]
Middleton and Michelena bought their bankrupt film company for "a few thousand dollars" in 1917 and renamed it Michelena Studios.&lt;ref name="PacSun2008"/&gt; Their new company was called Beatriz Michelena Features, and shooting began on their next feature-length film, ''Just Squaw''. Michelena's lead character was a white woman raised by American Indians, a woman who does not realize her racial heritage until after she falls into forbidden love with a white man. The movie played for only a week in San Francisco in 1919, and did not return a profit.

The moviemakers' new distributor, Robertson-Cole, was unable to find the right market for ''Heart of Juanita'' and ''The Flame of Hellgate'' in 1920. American audiences had grown more sophisticated, yet Michelena Studios was still employing their earlier production techniques.&lt;ref name="PacSun2008"/&gt; After shooting ''The Flame of Hellgate'', Middleton and Michelena stopped making movies altogether. She returned to her singing performances and he returned to his car sales. They reportedly divorced in the mid-1920s, though Middleton told the 1930 US Census that they were married.&lt;ref name=1930Census/&gt; The union produced no children.&lt;ref name="PacSun2008"/&gt;

==Retirement and final years==
After leaving film work, Michelena continued with her singing career, and toured Latin America (1927) where she was warmly received as part of a 30-person troupe of singers and dancers performing the operas ''[[Carmen]]'' and ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''.&lt;ref name=Fregoso2003/&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that this was ''"the first invasion of those countries by an American operatic star in repertoire performances"''.&lt;ref name=Fregoso2003/&gt; Afterward, she retired from singing,&lt;ref name="NYT-obituary"/&gt; and returned to San Rafael to live near her old film studio. Between 1937 and 1941, she sold 10 of the 26 real estate parcels that together had formed her studio lot.&lt;ref name="Finley1955"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawlink.com/research/CaseLevel3/29741 |title=Litchfield v. County of Marin, 130 Cal.App.2d 806 |last=Finley |first=J. |date=February 17, 1955 |publisher=Lawlink: the attorney network |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 10, 1942, after a surgical operation in San Francisco, she died at the age of 52.&lt;ref name="NYT-obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beatriz Michelena |date=October 12, 1942 |work=The New York Times|location=San Francisco }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister Vera Michelena and her ex-husband George Middleton survived her.&lt;ref name="Finley1955"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The Michelena Features studio facility in San Rafael sat empty through the 1920s with its solitary metal-clad brick vault housing all the company's [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate]] films, including the earlier ones shot by CMPC. In 1931, boys playing with a firecracker at the deserted lot set the vault and all of its flammable contents spectacularly on fire. Every known copy of Michelena's movies was destroyed, a loss that Middleton estimated at $200,000;&lt;ref name="PacSun2008"/&gt; worth about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.2|1931|r=1}}}} million today. In 1996, an 82-year-old nitrate copy of ''Salomy Jane'' was found in Australia; it was sent to the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation. Awareness of Michelena's contribution to early film, and her role as a groundbreaking Hispanic star, rose in 2002 with a proclamation made by President [[George W. Bush]] upon the occasion of [[National Hispanic Heritage Month]] in which he listed her as one of America's influential Latino actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Bush |first=George W. |authorlink=George W. Bush |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/09/20020914-3.html |publisher=The White House |title=National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2002 |date=September 14, 2002 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a new print of ''Salomy Jane'' was released for limited distribution.&lt;ref name="California Film Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://criticaretro.blogspot.com/2015/10/as-latinas-do-cinema-mudo-myrtle.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benno Schotz''' (28 August 1891 [[Kuressaare|Arensburg]] – 11 October 1984 [[Glasgow]]) was an Estonian-born Scottish sculptor, and one of twentieth century Scotland's leading artists.

==Biography ==

===Early life===
Schotz was the youngest of six children of [[Jew]]ish parents, Jacob Schotz, a watchmaker, and Cherna Tischa Abramovitch. He was educated at the Boys Grammar School of [[Pärnu]], [[Estonia]]. Later he studied at the [[Grossherzogliche Technische Hochschule]] in [[Darmstadt]], Germany.

In 1912, he immigrated to Glasgow, where he gained an engineering diploma from the [[Royal Technical College]]. From 1914 to 1923 he worked in the drawing office of [[John Brown and Company]], a [[Clydebank]] [[shipbuilding|shipbuilder]]s, while attending evening classes in sculpture at the [[Glasgow School of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Manz, S. &amp; Panayi, P. (2013) ''Refugees and Cultural Transfer to Britain'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aS-PAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=john%20keppie&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20keppie&amp;f=false page 56] Routledge. {{ISBN|1317965930}} Retrieved March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic career===
Schotz became a full-time sculptor in 1923. An important early patron was the Dundee art collector William Boyd, thanks to whose influence both Dundee Dental School and Dundee Art Galleries &amp; Museums hold pieces by him.&lt;ref name="DundeeCourier"&gt;{{Citation
 | title = DENTAL HOSPITAL BENEFACTRESS
 | newspaper = Dundee Courier
 | page = 5
 | date = 19 September 1936
}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point onwards his reputation grew and he became a full member of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]], head of sculpture at the Glasgow School of Art (a post he held from 1938 until his retirement in 1961), and eventually was appointed the [[Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland]] in 1963. His pupils included the artists [[Hannah Frank]],  Stewart Bowman Johnson, and [[Inge King| Inge King (née Neufeld)]].

His homes at West Campbell Street and later Kirklee Road were a focus for meetings of artists, writers, actors, and politicians. He was also a member of [[Glasgow Art Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib6_1231758399 Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain &amp; Ireland 1851–1951] Retrieved 17 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped refugees such as [[Jankel Adler]] and [[Josef Herman]].

He was a committed [[Zionist]], and also proud of his adopted [[Scotland]]. He worked until a few weeks before his death at the age of 93. He was buried in [[Jerusalem]].

He was made a Freeman of the City of Glasgow in 1981. In that same year, Gordon Wright published his autobiography, ''Bronze in My Blood''.

== Work ==
During his career, Schotz produced several hundred portraits and compositions including figure compositions, religious sculptures, semi-abstracts and modelled portraits. His bust of [[James Maxton]] is on public display at the Maxton remembrance garden in [[Barrhead]] near [[Paisley (Scotland)|Paisley]]. Other publicly accessible work includes:
* ''Memorial to Provost [[John Jarvie]] of [[Kilsyth]]'', first freeman of the burgh, commissioned in 1954 is a portrait in relief and can be seen in John Jarvie Square, off East Burnside Street, [[Kilsyth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kilsyth.org.uk/landmarks.htm |title = Kilsyth Today |website = Kilsyth Community Council |accessdate = 7 January 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140107235410/http://www.kilsyth.org.uk/landmarks.htm |archivedate = 7 January 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Psalmist'' (1974) in the [[JT Honeyman]] Memorial Garden of [[Kelvingrove Park]],
* the ''[[Joseph Black]] Memorial'' (1953) at the [[University of Glasgow]],
* the ''Painting'' and ''Sculpture'' reliefs on the [[Mercat Building]] (1928–29) and
* the [[Stations of the Cross]] sculptures in [[Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia|St. Charles' Parish Church]] [[North Kelvinside]].
* the Crucifix in [[St Columba's Church, Woodside]], Glasgow
* ''Ex Terra'' in [[Glenrothes]] town centre next to the bus station
*bust of [[James Pittendrigh Macgillivray]], [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] (1924)
* busts of William Boyd, Mrs William Rettie and William Tattersall in Dundee Dental Hospital &amp; School, University of Dundee&lt;ref name="DundeeCourier" /&gt;
* a bust of William Boyd's daughter Joan at The McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery &amp; Museum
* bust of [[Keir Hardie]], [[People's Palace, Glasgow]]

The majority of these works were all in Glasgow and the surrounding area. He was responsible for the repair on the bridge sculpture at Kelvingrove Park beside the now refurbished art gallery and museum.

Although Benno Schotz is frequently referred to as an Estonian sculptor, all his professional life was in Scotland. He became a naturalised British subject in 1930.
He became a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy, 1937. He headed the Sculpture and Ceramics dept. of the Glasgow School of Art from 1938 until his retirement in 1960. His active life as a sculptor continued thereafter with renewed vigor and he created his most ambitious and monumental works over the next 20 years. 
In 1963, he was appointed The Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland, a member of the Royal household. 
A major retrospective exhibition of his works (1971) was held at the Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh.
His interest in the drawing of trees developed, the drawings becoming more and more complex and abstract. He mounted a successful exhibition of Sculptures and Related Drawings in Glasgow (1961). His last sculpture was executed less than six weeks before his death, aged 93.
He was Life-President of the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.
Honors include: Freedom of the City of Glasgow; Honorary Fellow of The Hebrew University; Honorary LL.D, Strathclyde University; Honorary Member of the British Society of British Sculptors; Honorary Member of the Royal Institute of Architects in Scotland.

Schotz wrote at least one book: "Bronze is in my Blood",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstraven.com/sstowell/Family/Bob.html&lt;/ref&gt; a memoir of his life.

A '''collection manager''' ensures the proper care and preservation of objects within [[cultural institutions]] such as [[museums]], [[libraries]], and [[archives]]. Collection managers, along with [[Registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[curators]], and [[conservator-restorer|conservators]], play an important role in [[collections care]].  Collection Managers and Registrars are two distinct collection roles that are often combined into one within small to mid-size cultural institutions. Collection Managers can be found in large museums and those with a [[history]] and [[natural history]]
focus whose diverse collections require experienced assessment to properly sort, catalog, and store artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaser|first=Jane|title=Museums: A Place to Work|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|author2=Zenetou, Artemis|isbn=0-415-12724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection manager may oversee the registrar, archivist, curator, photographer, or other collection professionals, and may assume the responsibilities of these roles in their absence within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, R., Gilmore, J., ed. (2010). Museum Registration Methods (5 ed.). Washington, D.C.: The AAM Press. {{ISBN|978-1-933253-15-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between collection managers and registrars==
Collection managers are responsible for the long-term preservation of collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fifield|first=Becky|title=Museum Mondays-What is a Collections Manager?|url=http://thestillroomblog.com/2012/04/23/museum-monday-what-is-a-collections-manager/|work=The Still Room|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They oversee the physical care of objects and form the hands-on problem-solving component of a collections team. Collection managers work collaboratively with registrars, who are document-oriented and responsible for risk management of the collection. 
Registrars maintain facility reports, contracts, and legal records associated with acquisitions, inventory, incoming and outgoing loans, shipping, and insurance. They must keep current with national and international regulations and procedures as they work with custom agents and brokers to acquire security, custom permits, insurance coverage, government indemnity, and requests for immunity from judicial seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections Management|url=https://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation-and-collections-care/collections-management|work=Museum of Fine Arts Boston|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities and duties==
[[File:Storage Gallery.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Storage of Peruvian ceramics at the [[Larco Museum]]]]
Collection managers work in cooperation with curators, registrars, conservators, art handlers, exhibit fabricators, mount makers, facilities managers, security, and housekeeping. They are responsible for establishing and maintaining high standards of collections care, from acquisition to conservation to display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections Manager|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/careers/9914|work=Museums Association|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the institution, collection managers may by tasked with drawing up a departmental budget, providing expenditure projections, and if necessary, raising funds in the form of grant writing.

* '''Acquisition''': During acquisition consideration, the collection manager must research the object, determine its fit within the collection, ensure there are available resources for its care, and in the absence of a registrar, establish the object's [[provenance]]. Once acquired, the collection manager begins the accession process by carefully examining the object and classifying it based on the institution's specific guidelines. [[Categorization|Classification]] terms are drawn from an ordered system of categories and can vary from one institution to another. The purpose of classification is to provide order within a collection by grouping objects with similar characteristics such as form, shape, material, function, use, or social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Class|url=http://www.vraweb.org/ccoweb/cco/parttwo_chapter7.html|work=Cataloging Cultural Objects Part 2: Chapter 7|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object is then given a unique [[Accession number (library science)|identifying number]], tying it to all related records. Next, the object is carefully measured, photographed, and described in a detailed condition report.  
* '''Object Care''': Proper [[collections care]], or preventative conservation, is imperative to the welfare of objects by avoiding and minimizing deterioration and loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preventative Conservation|url=http://www.icom-cc.org/36/working-groups/preventive-conservation/|work=International Council of Museums-Committee for Conservation|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection managers are responsible for proper object handling and for instructing/supervising other staff members, researchers, interns, and volunteers on proper procedures. They monitor the condition and environment of objects in storage and on exhibit,  rotating sensitive objects off exhibit as needed. Collection managers clean and stabilize objects, select appropriate archival supplies, prepare objects for storage and exhibition, and pack and label objects for loan. Collection managers also design and prepare exhibit mounts for delicate objects on display and in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fruth|first=Marth|title=A Primer on Museum Collection Management|url=http://www.ohiolha.org/how-tos/a-primer-on-museum-collection-management/|work=Ohio Local History Alliance|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to best utilize storage space, collection managers may need to rehouse and relocate objects within and between museum facilities while closely tracking and documenting all object movement.
* '''Inventory''': A key responsibility of collection managers is performing a detailed inventory of all items in their collection.&lt;ref name="Brunot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brunot|first=Trudy|title=Job Description of a Museum Collections Manager|url=http://work.chron.com/job-description-museum-collections-manager-18372.html|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the institution's collection management policy, a complete inventory can be taken every 5–10 years, with spot inventories performed annually. 
* '''Exhibition''': At the request of curators or borrowing institutions, the collection manager retrieves objects from storage and examines them for potential exhibition or loan consideration. After close examination and comparison with prior condition reports, a determination is made regarding the object's current condition, fragility level, special exhibition or shipping requirements, and/or need for conservation. Once objects have been cleared for exhibition or loan, the collection manager cleans and stabilizes them and ensures their safety by monitoring and/or assisting with the exhibit installation and deinstallation. Collection managers may also be tasked with interpretation and case selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Manager/Registrar|url=http://berkshiremuseum.org/collections-managerregistrar/|work=Berkshire Museum|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
* '''Database Management''': Collection managers are responsible for documenting object information into their institution's database management system. The proper input and maintenance of this information is imperative. According to the National Park Service, "the information on the catalog records may be as important as the items themselves." &lt;ref name="NPS, 3:1"&gt;{{cite book|last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part II: Museum Collections|year =2000|chapter =Chapter 3: Cataloging"|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/mh2ch3.pdf|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum amount of information entered into the database should be catalog number, accession number, nature of accession (e.g. gift, purchase), provenance, object name, classification, materials, dimensions, condition, and current location.  Institutions utilize the catalog information to manage their collections, facilitate interdepartmental communications, and make collections available to researchers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Management Systems: Museums and the Web 2011|url=http://www.idea.org/blog/2011/04/07/collection-management-systems-museums-and-the-web-2011/|work=Institute for Dynaic Educational Advancement|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum Collection Management Software is determined by the size, collection type, and budget of the institution.
*  '''Environmental Control''': Dust, pests, light exposure, extremes and/or fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity can adversely affect objects. The collection manager, in conjunction with the facilities manager, is responsible for monitoring environmental controls, establishing and maintaining an [[integrated pest management]] system, coordinating a housekeeping routine, and ensuring the security of all objects within the building.
* '''Collection Management Policy''': Collection managers assist with  writing and updating [[collections policy|collection care policies]]. An institution's collection is its greatest asset. As such, they have a legal, ethical, and fiduciary obligation to provide for its safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Management Policies (CMP)|url=http://www.spencerart.ku.edu/collection/collection_management_policies.pdf|work=Spencer Art Museum|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Collection management policy is a detailed, written statement that explains why a museum is in operation and how it goes about its business." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malaro|first=Marie|title=A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58834-322-2|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection management policy guides an institution's decision making and covers a range of topics including collection goals, methods of acquisition and disposal of objects, incoming/outgoing loan policies, care, control, and access to objects, insurance procedures, and record keeping. Some institutions also assign [[emergency management]] (disaster planning) responsibility to collection managers.&lt;ref name="Brunot"/&gt;

==Knowledge, abilities, and skills==
There are specific skills, abilities, and areas of knowledge necessary for collection managers. All collection managers must be skilled in object handling, able to accurately identify objects, artifacts, and specimens within their institution's collection, and have knowledge of preventative conservation methods and procedures. It is essential that collection managers are educated about the organization, arrangement, and nomenclature of objects, artifacts, and specimens in their field of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaser|first=Jane|title=Museums: A Place to Work|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|pages=75–76|author2=Zenetou, Artemis|isbn=0-415-12724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection managers also need to be knowledgeable about collection management software for cataloging and record keeping.

==Education and training (experience)==
Most institutions require collection managers to have an undergraduate degree in their specialty area such as art, history, or archeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seversen|first=Dana|title=The Salary of a Museum Collections Manager|url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/salary-museum-collections-manager-15479.html|work=Global Post|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, from 2012 - 2022 archivists, curators, and museum workers "should expect very strong competition for jobs" with a projected growth rate of only 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archivists, Curators, and Museum Workers|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/curators-museum-technicians-and-conservators.htm|work=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this competitive field, a master's degree in the institution's area of focus, museum studies, or library/information science is preferred.

Internships and volunteer work in libraries, museums, and archives is the best way to acquire hands-on collection management experience. Whether paid or unpaid, experience with object/artifact handling, processing, cataloging, preservation, packing, storage, inventory, fabrication, and collection management software is essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlatter|first=N. Elizabeth|title=Museum Careers|date=2008|publisher=Left Coast Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA|isbn=978-1-59874-044-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experience or training in conservation would be an added bonus, especially to small museums with limited resources.

==Professional organizations==
There are numerous professional organizations of interest to collection managers and other museum professionals. These organizations provide opportunities to network, share information, and participate in continuing education.

Marx did not live to publish the planned second and third parts, but they were both completed from his notes and published after his death by his colleague [[Friedrich Engels]].

== Themes ==
{{Original research|date=October 2012}}
In ''Das Kapital'' (1867), Marx proposes that the motivating force of [[capitalism]] is in the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of [[labour (economics)|labor]], whose unpaid work is the ultimate source of [[surplus value]]. The [[employer|owner of the means of production]] is able to claim the right to this surplus value because he or she is legally protected by the [[capitalist state|ruling regime]] through [[property rights]] and the legally established distribution of [[Share (finance)|shares]] which are by law only to be distributed to company owners and their board members. The historical section shows how these rights were acquired in the first place chiefly through plunder and conquest and the activity of the merchant and "middle-man". In producing [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (produced goods), the workers continually reproduce the economic conditions by which they labour. ''Capital'' proposes an explanation of the "laws of motion" of the capitalist economic system, from its origins to its future, by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital, the growth of [[wage labour]], the transformation of the workplace, the concentration of capital, commercial competition, the [[banking]] system, the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|decline of the profit rate]], land-rents, ''et cetera''.

The critique of the political economy of capitalism proposes that:
* Wage-labour is the basic "cell-form" (trade unit) of a capitalist society. Moreover, because commerce as a human activity implied no [[Ethics|morality]] beyond that required to buy and sell goods and services, the growth of the market system made discrete entities of the economic, the moral and the legal spheres of human activity in society; hence, subjective [[moral value]] is separate from objective economic value. Subsequently, [[political economy]]—the just [[distribution of wealth]] and "political arithmetick" about taxes—became three discrete fields of human activity: [[economics]], [[law]] and [[ethics]], politics and economics divorced.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
* "The economic formation of society [is] a process of natural history". It is thus possible for a [[Political economy|political economist]] to objectively study the scientific laws of capitalism, given that its expansion of the market system of commerce had [[Objectification|objectified]] human economic relations; the use of [[money]] (cash nexus) voided religious and political illusions about its [[Theory of value (economics)|economic value]] and replaced them with [[commodity fetishism]], the belief that an object (commodity) has inherent economic value. Because societal economic formation is a historical process, no one person could control or direct it, thereby creating a global complex of social connections among capitalists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The economic formation (individual commerce) of a society thus precedes the human administration of an economy (organised commerce).
* The structural contradictions of a capitalist economy, the ''gegensätzliche Bewegung'', describe the contradictory movement originating from the two-fold character of labour and so the [[class struggle]] between [[Labour (economics)|labour]] and [[capitalism|capital]], the [[wage labour]]er and the [[Bourgeoisie|owner]] of the [[means of production]]. These capitalist economic contradictions operate "behind the backs" of the capitalists and the workers as a result of their activities and yet remain beyond their immediate [[perception]]s as men and women and as [[social class]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. ''Capital'': The Process of Capitalist Production. 3d German edition (tr.), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The economic crises ([[recession]], [[Depression (economics)|depression]], ''et cetera'') that are rooted in the contradictory character of the economic value of the commodity (cell-unit) of a capitalist society are the conditions that propitiate [[Proletariat|proletarian]] [[revolution]]—which ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848) collectively identified as a weapon, forged by the capitalists, which the working class "turned against the [[bourgeoisie]], itself".
* In a capitalist economy, [[technology|technological]] improvement and its consequent increased production augment the amount of [[Wealth|material wealth]] ([[use value]]) in society while simultaneously diminishing the [[Value (economics)|economic value]] of the same wealth, thereby [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|diminishing the rate of profit]]—a [[paradox]] characteristic of economic crisis in a capitalist economy. "Poverty in the midst of plenty" consequent to over-production and under-consumption.

After two decades of economic study and preparatory work (especially regarding the theory of [[surplus value]]), the first volume appeared in 1867 as ''The Production Process of Capital''. After Marx's death in 1883, from manuscripts and the first volume Engels introduced Volume II: ''The Circulation Process of Capital'' in 1885; and Volume III: ''The Overall Process of Capitalist Production'' in 1894. These three volumes are collectively known as ''Das Kapital''.

=== ''Capital. Volume I'' ===
''[[Capital, Volume I]]'' (1867) is a critical analysis of political economy, meant to reveal the contradictions of the capitalist mode of production, how it was the precursor of the [[socialist mode of production]] and of the [[class struggle]] rooted in the capitalist social relations of production. The first of three volumes of ''Das Kapital. Kritik der politischen Ökonomie'' (''Capital. Critique of Political Economy'') was published on 14 September 1867, dedicated to [[Wilhelm Wolff]] and was the sole volume published in Marx’s lifetime.

=== ''Capital. Volume II'' ===
''[[Capital, Volume II]]'', subtitled ''The Process of Circulation of Capital'', was prepared by Engels from notes left by Marx and published in 1885. It is divided into three parts: ''The Metamorphoses of Capital and Their Circuits'', ''The Turnover of Capital'' and ''The Reproduction and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital''.  In ''Volume II'', the main ideas behind the marketplace are to be found: how value and surplus-value are realized. Its dramatis personae are not so much the worker and the industrialist (as in ''Volume I''), but rather the money owner (and money lender), the wholesale merchant, the trader and the entrepreneur or functioning capitalist. Moreover, workers appear in ''Volume II'', essentially as buyers of consumer goods and therefore as sellers of the commodity labour power, rather than producers of value and surplus-value—though this latter quality, established in ''Volume I'', remains the solid foundation on which the whole of the unfolding analysis is based. Reading ''Volume II'' is of monumental significance to understanding the theoretical construction of Marx's whole argument. Marx himself quite precisely clarified this place in a letter sent to Engels on 30 April 1868: "In Book 1... we content ourselves with the assumption that if in the self-expansion process £100 becomes £110, the latter will find already in existence in the market the elements into which it will change once more. But now we investigate the conditions under which these elements are found at hand, namely the social intertwining of the different capitals, of the component parts of capital and of revenue (= s)". This intertwining, conceived as a movement of commodities and of money, enabled Marx to work out at least the essential elements, if not the definitive form, of a coherent theory of the trade cycle, based upon the inevitability of periodic disequilibrium between supply and demand under the capitalist mode of production (Mandel, 1978, ''Introdution to Volume II of Capital''). ''Volume II'' of ''Capital'' has indeed been not only a sealed book, but also a forgotten one. To a large extent, it remains so to this very day. Part 3 is the point of departure for a [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] given its Marxist treatment later in detail by [[Rosa Luxemburg]], among others.

=== ''Capital. Volume III'' ===
''[[Capital, Volume III]]'', subtitled ''The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole'', was prepared by Friedrich Engels from notes left by Karl Marx and published in 1894. It is in seven parts:
# The conversion of Surplus Value into [[Profit (economics)|Profit]] and the rate of Surplus Value into the rate of Profit
# Conversion of Profit into Average Profit
# The Law of the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall]]
# Conversion of Commodity Capital and Money Capital into Commercial Capital and Money-Dealing Capital (Merchant's Capital)
# Division of Profit Into Interest and Profit of Enterprise, Interest Bearing Capital.
# Transformation of Surplus-Profit into Ground [[Economic rent|Rent]].
# Revenues and Their Sources
The work is best known today for Part 3, which in summary says that as the organic fixed capital requirements of production rise as a result of advancements in production generally, the [[rate of profit]] tends to fall. This result, which [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxists]] believe is a principal contradictory characteristic leading to an inevitable collapse of the capitalist order, was held by Marx and Engels to—as a result of various contradictions in the capitalist [[mode of production]]—result in [[Crisis theory|crises]] whose resolution necessitates the emergence of an entirely new mode of production as the culmination of the same historical dialectic that led to the emergence of capitalism from prior forms.

== Intellectual influences ==
The purpose of ''Das Kapital'' (1867) was a scientific foundation for the politics of the modern [[labour movement]]. The analyses were meant "to bring a [[Political economy|science]], by criticism, to the point where it can be [[Dialectics|dialectically]] represented" and so "reveal the law of motion of modern society"{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} to describe how the capitalist mode of production was the precursor of the socialist mode of production. The argument is a critique of the classical economics of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and [[Benjamin Franklin]], drawing on the [[dialectic]]al method that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] developed in ''[[Science of Logic]]'' and ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''; other intellectual influences on ''Capital'' were the French socialists [[Charles Fourier]], [[Comte de Saint-Simon]], [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]; and the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]], especially [[Aristotle]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

At university, Marx wrote a dissertation comparing the [[philosophy of nature]] in the works of the philosophers [[Democritus]] (circa 460–370 BC) and [[Epicurus]] (341–270 BC). The logical architecture of ''Das Kapital'' is derived in part from the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' and the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' by Aristotle, including the fundamental distinction between [[use value]] and [[exchange value]],&lt;ref&gt;Marx credits Aristotle for being the "first to analyze... the form of value." In addition, he identifies the categories of use and exchange value with the Aristotlean distinction between the ''Oeconomic'' and the ''Chrematisitic''.  In the ''Politics'', the former is defined as "value in use," while the latter is defined as a practice in which exchange value becomes an end unto itself."Marx, ''Capital'' Vol. 1, trans. Ben Fowkes (New York: Knopf Doubleday, 1977), 68, 253, f. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[syllogisms]]" ([[C-M-C']] and [[M-C-M']]) for simple commodity circulation and the circulation of [[Value (economics)|value]] as [[capital (economics)|capital]].&lt;ref&gt;see Meikle, Scott, ''Aristotle's Economic Thought'' (London: Clarendon Press, 1997) and McCarthy, George, ''Marx and Aristotle: Nineteenth Century German Social Theory and Classical Antiquity'' (New York: Rowman and Littlefield, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the description of [[machinery]], under capitalist relations of production, as "self-acting [[automata]]" derives from Aristotle’s speculations about inanimate instruments capable of obeying commands as the condition for the abolition of [[slavery]]. In the nineteenth century, Marx’s research of the available politico-economic literature required twelve years, usually in the [[British Library]], London.&lt;ref&gt;''Capital'', Vol. 1, trans. Fowkes (Knopf Doubleday, 1977), 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death (1883), Marx had prepared the manuscript for ''Das Kapital, Volume IV'', a critical history of theories of [[surplus value]] of his time, the nineteenth century. The philosopher [[Karl Kautsky]] (1854–1938) published a partial edition of Marx's surplus-value critique and later published a full, three-volume edition as ''Theorien über den Mehrwert'' (''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', 1905–1910). The first volume was published in English as ''A History of Economic Theories'' (1952).&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition (1994) p. 1707.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==
''[[Capital, Volume I]]'' (1867) was published in Marx’s lifetime, but he died in 1883 before completing the manuscripts for ''[[Capital, Volume II]]'' (1885) and ''[[Capital, Volume III]]'' (1894), which friend and collaborator Friedrich Engels edited and published as the work of Marx. The first translated publication of ''Das Kapital'' was in [[Russian history, 1892–1917|Imperial Russia]] in March 1872. It was the first foreign publication and the English edition appeared in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Ostler, Nicholas. ''Empires of the Word: A Language History of the World''. HarperCollins: London and New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] [[censorship]] proscribing "the harmful doctrines of [[socialism]] and [[communism]]", the Russian censors considered ''Capital'' as a "strictly scientific work" of [[political economy]] the content of which did not apply to [[Absolute monarchy|monarchic]] Russia, where "capitalist [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]" had never occurred and was officially dismissed, given "that very few people in [[Russian history, 1892–1917|Russia]] will read it, and even fewer will understand it". Nonetheless, Marx acknowledged that Russia was the country where ''Capital'' "was read and valued more than anywhere". The Russian edition was the fastest selling. 3,000 copies were sold in one year while the German edition took five years to sell 1,000, thus the Russian translation sold fifteen times faster than the German original.&lt;ref name="A People's Tragedy 1996 pg. 139"&gt;''A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924'' (London 1996) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the global economic collapse of 2008–2009, ''Das Kapital'' was reportedly in high demand in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7679758.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Marx popular amid credit crunch|publisher=|date=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Red Quill Books]] released ''Capital: In Manga!'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/capital-manga/| title = Capital: In Manga!| last = Yasko| first = Guy| publisher = [[Red Quill Books]]| year = 2012| isbn = 978-1-926958-19-4| access-date = 25 February 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160225150827/http://redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/capital-manga/|archive-date = 25 February 2016| dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comic book version of Volume I which is an expanded English translation of the wildly successful&lt;ref&gt;Marx's 'Das Kapital' comic finds new fans in Japan.

== Translations ==
The foreign editions of ''Capital. Critique of Political Economy'' (1867) by Karl Marx include a Russian translation by the [[revolution]]ary [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814–1876). Eventually Marx's work was translated into all major languages. The English translation by Samuel Moore and Marx's son-in-law [[Edward Aveling]] of book 1, overseen by Engels, was published in 1887 as ''Capital: A Critical Analysis of Capitalist Production'' by [[William Swan Sonnenschein|Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey, &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/marx-karl-1818-1883-capital-a-critical-analysis-5809013-details.aspx | title=MARX, Karl (1818-1883). ''Capital: A Critical Analysis of Capitalist Production''. London: Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey, &amp; Co., 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reissued in the 1970s by [[Progress Publishers]] in Moscow while a more recent English translation was made by Ben Fowkes and David Fernbach (the Penguin edition). The definitive critical edition of Marx's works, "MEGA II" (''Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe''), includes ''Das Kapital'' in German (and French, for the first volume) and shows all the versions and alterations made to the text, plus a very extensive apparatus of footnotes and (cross-)references.

== Reviews ==
In 2017, the historian [[Gareth Stedman Jones]] wrote in the Books and Arts section of the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Gareth Stedman Jones]], [https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v547/n7664/full/547401a.html "In retrospect: Das Kapital"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', volume 547, pages 401-402, 27 July 2017 (page visited on 30 July 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Block quote|What is extraordinary about ''Das Kapital'' is that it offers a still-unrivalled picture of the dynamism of capitalism and its transformation of societies on a global scale. It firmly embedded concepts such as commodity and capital in the lexicon. And it highlights some of the vulnerabilities of capitalism, including its unsettling disruption of states and political systems. [...] If ''Das Kapital'' has now emerged as one of the great landmarks of nineteenth-century thought, it is [because it connects] critical analysis of the economy of his time with its historical roots. In doing so, he inaugurated a debate about how best to reform or transform politics and social relations, which has gone on ever since.}}Positive reception also cited the soundness of the methodology used in producing the book, which is called immanent critique. This approach, which starts from simple category and gradually unfolds into complex categories, employed "internal" criticism that finds contradiction within and between categories while discovering aspects of reality that the categories cannot explain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marx's 'Das Kapital' For Beginners|last=Wayne|first=Michael|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|year=2012|isbn=9781934389638|location=Danbury, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that Marx had to build his arguments on historical narratives and empirical evidence rather than the arbitrary application of his ideas in his evaluation of capitalism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the other hand, ''Das Kapitalism'' was also criticized for a number of weaknesses. For instance, there are theorists who stressed that this text was unable to reconcile the capitalist exploitation with prices dependent upon subjective wants in exchange relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Rationalist Critique of Deconstruction: Demystifying Poststructuralism and Derrida's Science of the "Non"|last=Brown|first=Morgan|publisher=The Culture &amp; Anarchy Press|year=2017|isbn=9781365481901|location=|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also those who argued that Marx's so-called "increasing misery" doctrine, which is presumed to mean that the proletariat is absolutely immiserated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blacks and Social Justice|last=Boxill|first=Bernard|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=1992|isbn=978-0847677573|location=Lanham, MD|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|date=March 1960|title=Marx's "Increasing Misery" Doctrine|url=|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=50|pages=111–120|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Templom.jpg|thumb|250px|Abbey church of Tihany]]
[[File:Hungarian sentence tihany 11th c.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The longest Hungarian fragment in the Latin text]]
The '''Establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany''' is a document known for including the oldest written words in the [[Hungarian language]]. The document, dated to 1055, lists the lands the king donated to the newly founded [[Tihany Abbey]]. It is mostly in [[Latin]], but contains several Hungarian words and expressions, the longest of which is ''feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea'' (in modern Hungarian: ''Fehérvárra menő hadiútra,'' 'onto the military road leading to [[Székesfehérvár|Fehérvár]]'). 

==Background==
The Benedictine abbey of [[Tihany]] was founded by [[Andrew I of Hungary|King Andrew I]] and was dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[Aignan of Orleans]]. The establishing charter is likely to have been composed by Bishop Nicholas. The Benedictine monks were settled in Tihany by King Andrew, who had a church and a monastery built for them on the hill of the [[Tihany peninsula]] near [[Lake Balaton]]. The charter, written on [[vellum]], is today in the Benedictine abbey of [[Pannonhalma]].

The road mentioned must have been a military road from [[Pannonia|Roman times]], still used in medieval times. It was the most important road from Fehérvár to the south. Fehérvár – today [[Székesfehérvár]] – was one of the most important cities of medieval Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benceskiado.hu/index.php?hlid=23 Zelliger Erzsébet: Első nyelvemlékeink és a 950 éves Tihanyi alapítólevél, Új Ember, 2005. november 20.], www.benceskiado.hu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The Hungarian words in the text reflect 11th century Hungarian language. Not only proper nouns, but common nouns and expressions are included. The longest of these, ''&amp; feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea'' clearly shows a language stage in which the ''-ra'' suffix (''-re'' after front vowels) has not yet evolved into a suffix from a [[Preposition and postposition|postposition]], and in which the final vowels are still preserved (compare 'Feheruuaru' with modern 'Fehérvár' and 'utu' with modern 'út' – don't pay attention to the diacritics as in 1055 Hungarian spelling was not yet developed to show the a/á and u/ú difference, although they must have existed in pronunciation). In total, the document includes 58 Hungarian words, among them ''Tichon,'' an early spelling of the name Tihany.

'''Folk music''' includes [[#Traditional folk music|traditional folk music]] and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th-century [[folk revival]]. Some types of folk music may be called [[‘World music’]]. Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by [[Convention (norm)|custom]] over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and [[art music|classical styles]]. The term originated in the 19th century, but folk music extends beyond that.

Starting in the mid-18th century, a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the (third) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. This form of music is sometimes called [[contemporary folk music]] or [[folk revival]] music to distinguish it from earlier folk forms.&lt;ref name="AboutDefinition"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://folkmusic.about.com/od/glossary/g/FolkMusic.htm |publisher=About.com definition |title=Folk Music |first1=Kim |last1=Ruehl |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller, similar revivals have occurred elsewhere in the world at other times, but the term folk music has typically not been applied to the new music created during those revivals. This type of folk music also includes fusion genres such as [[folk rock]], [[folk metal]], and others. While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, in Romanian it shares a different name, and it often does not share the same people and animals as traditional music.

=== Definitions ===
A consistent definition of '''traditional folk music''' is elusive.&lt;ref name = NERevival&gt;''The Never-Ending Revival'' by Michael F. Scully  University of Illinois Press Urbana and Chicago 2008 {{ISBN|978-0252033339}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The terms ''folk music'', ''folk song'', and ''[[folk dance]]'' are comparatively recent expressions. They are extensions of the term ''[[folklore]]'', which was coined in 1846 by the English antiquarian [[William Thoms]] to describe "the traditions, customs, and superstitions of the uncultured classes".&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977"&gt;Percy Scholes, ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP 1977, article "Folk Song".&lt;/ref&gt; The term further derives from the German expression ''[[Völkisch movement|Volk]]'', in the sense of "the people as a whole" as applied to popular and national music by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and the German Romantics over half a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;A.L.Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional folk music also includes most [[indigenous music]].&lt;ref name = NERevival/&gt;

However, despite the assembly of an enormous body of work over some two centuries, there is still no certain definition of what folk music (or [[folklore]], or the [[Wikt:folk|folk]]) is.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Middleton, Richard]], ''Studying Popular Music'', Philadelphia: Open University Press (1990/2002). {{ISBN|0335152759}}, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = NERevival/&gt; Some do not even agree that the term Folk Music should be used.&lt;ref name = NERevival/&gt; Folk music may tend to have certain characteristics&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; but it cannot clearly be differentiated in purely musical terms. One meaning often given is that of "old songs, with no known composers",&lt;ref name="Ronald D. Cohen 2006 pp. 1-2"&gt;Ronald D. Cohen ''Folk music: the basics'' (CRC Press, 2006), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; another is that of music that has been submitted to an evolutionary "process of [[oral transmission]].... the fashioning and re-fashioning of the music by the community that give it its folk character".&lt;ref name="Lloyd 1969"&gt;International Folk Music Council definition (1954/5), given in Lloyd (1969) and Scholes (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such definitions depend upon "(cultural) processes rather than abstract musical types...", upon "''continuity'' and ''oral transmission''...seen as characterizing one side of a cultural dichotomy, the other side of which is found not only in the lower layers of feudal, capitalist and some oriental societies but also in 'primitive' societies and in parts of 'popular cultures'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Seeger]] (1980), citing the approach of Redfield (1947) and Dundes (1965), quoted in Middleton (1990) p.127.&lt;/ref&gt;  One widely used definition is simply "Folk music is what the people sing".&lt;ref name="Donaldson, 2011 page 13"&gt;Donaldson, 2011 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

For Scholes,&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; as well as for [[Cecil Sharp]] and [[Béla Bartók]],&lt;ref name="A.L.Lloyd, 1969, pp. 14-5"&gt;A. L. Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; there was a sense of the music of the country as distinct from that of the town. Folk music was already, "...seen as the authentic expression of a way of life now past or about to disappear (or in some cases, to be preserved or somehow revived)",&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, Richard 1990, p. 127.  ''Studying Popular Music''. Milton Keynes; Philadelphia: Open University Press. {{ISBN|0335152767|0335152759}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in "a community uninfluenced by art music"&lt;ref name="Lloyd 1969" /&gt; and by commercial and printed song. Lloyd rejected this in favour of a simple distinction of economic class&lt;ref name="A.L.Lloyd, 1969, pp. 14-5" /&gt; yet for him true folk music was, in [[Charles Seeger]]'s words, "associated with a lower class"&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt; in culturally and socially stratified societies. In these terms folk music may be seen as part of a "schema comprising four musical types: 'primitive' or 'tribal'; 'elite' or 'art'; 'folk'; and 'popular'".&lt;ref name="Charles Seeger 1980 p.127"&gt;Charles Seeger (1980) quoted in Middleton (1990) p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music in this genre is also often called ''traditional music.''  Although the term is usually only descriptive, in some cases people use it as the name of a genre.  For example, the [[Grammy Award]] previously used the terms "traditional music" and "traditional folk" for folk music that is not contemporary folk music.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==== Characteristics ====
From a historical perspective, traditional folk music had these characteristics:&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt;{{verification needed|date=November 2016}}
* It was transmitted through an [[oral tradition]]. Before the 20th century, ordinary people were usually illiterate; they acquired songs by memorizing them. Primarily, this was not mediated by books or recorded or transmitted media. Singers may extend their repertoire using [[Broadside (music)|broadsheets]] or [[song book]]s, but these secondary enhancements are of the same character as the primary songs experienced in the flesh.
* The music was often related to [[Culture|national culture]]. It was culturally particular; from a particular region or culture. In the context of an [[immigrant]] group, folk music acquires an extra dimension for social cohesion. It is particularly conspicuous in immigrant societies, where [[Greek Australians]], [[Somali Americans]], [[Punjabi Canadians]], and others strive to emphasize their differences from the mainstream. They learn songs and dances that originate in the countries their grandparents came from.
* They commemorate historical and personal events. On certain days of the year, such as [[Easter]], [[May Day]], and [[Christmas]], particular songs celebrate the yearly cycle. [[Wedding]]s, [[birthday]]s, and [[funeral]]s may also be noted with songs, dances and special costumes. Religious festivals often have a folk music component. [[Choral music]] at these events brings children and non-professional singers to participate in a public arena, giving an emotional bonding that is unrelated to the aesthetic qualities of the music.
* The songs have been performed, by [[Convention (norm)|custom]], over a long period of time, usually several [[generation]]s.

As a side-effect, the following characteristics are sometimes present:
* There is no [[copyright]] on the songs. Hundreds of folk songs from the 19th century have known authors but have continued in oral tradition to the point where they are considered traditional for purposes of music publishing. This has become much less frequent since the 1940s. Today, almost every folk song that is recorded is credited with an arranger.
* Fusion of cultures: Because cultures interact and change over time, traditional songs evolving over time may incorporate and reflect influences from disparate cultures. The relevant factors may include instrumentation, [[Musical tuning|tunings]], [[Voicing (music)|voicings]], [[Phrasing (music)|phrasing]], subject matter, and even production methods.

==== Terminology ====

===== Tune =====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
In folk music, a ''tune'' is a short [[instrumental]] [[piece (music)|piece]], a [[melody]], often with repeating [[section (music)|sections]], and usually played a number of times. A collection of tunes with structural similarities is known as

=== Origins ===
[[File:Indian village musicians.jpg|thumb|Indians always distinguished between classical and folk music, though in the past even classical Indian music used to rely on the unwritten transmission of repertoire.]]
Throughout most of human prehistory and history, listening to [[recorded music]] was not possible. Music was made by common people during both their work and leisure, as well as during religious activities. The work of economic production was often manual and communal. [[Manual labor]] often included singing by the workers, which served several practical purposes. It reduced the [[boredom]] of repetitive tasks, it kept the [[rhythm]] during [[Synchronization|synchronized]] pushes and pulls, and it set the pace of many activities such as [[Sowing|planting]], [[weeding]], [[reaping]], [[threshing]], [[weaving]], and [[Milling (grinding)|milling]]. In [[leisure time]], singing and playing [[musical instrument]]s were common forms of entertainment and history-telling—even more common than today, when electrically enabled technologies and widespread literacy make other forms of entertainment and information-sharing competitive.&lt;ref name="SeegerLomaxDocumentary"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr9FP93o8Ro |title=To Hear Your Banjo Play, Alan Lomax's 1947 Documentary narrated by Pete Seeger |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that folk music originated as [[art music]] that was changed and probably debased by oral transmission, while reflecting the character of the society that produced it.&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; In many societies, especially preliterate ones, the cultural transmission of folk music requires [[Learning music by ear|learning by ear]], although [[Musical notation|notation]] has evolved in some cultures. Different cultures may have different notions concerning a division between "folk" music on the one hand and of "art" and "court" music on the other. In the proliferation of popular music genres, some traditional folk music became also referred to "[[World music]]" or "Roots music".

The English term "[[folklore]]", to describe traditional folk music and dance, entered the vocabulary of many continental European nations, each of which had its folk-song collectors and revivalists.&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; The distinction between "authentic" folk and national and [[popular song]] in general has always been loose, particularly in America and Germany&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; – for example popular songwriters such as [[Stephen Foster]] could be termed "folk" in America.&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.L.Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Folk Music Council]] definition allows that the term can also apply to music that, "...has originated with an individual composer and has subsequently been absorbed into the unwritten, living tradition of a community. But the term does not cover a song, dance, or tune that has been taken over ready-made and remains unchanged."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by both Scholes (1977) and Lloyd (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

The post–[[World War II]] folk revival in America and in Britain started a new genre, [[Contemporary Folk Music|contemporary folk music]], and brought an additional meaning to the term "folk music": newly composed songs, fixed in form and by known authors, which imitated some form of traditional music. The popularity of "contemporary folk" recordings caused the appearance of the category "Folk" in the [[Grammy Award]]s of 1959: in 1970 the term was dropped in favor of "Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording (including Traditional Blues)", while 1987 brought a distinction between "Best Traditional Folk Recording" and "Best Contemporary Folk Recording". After that, they had a "Traditional music" category that subsequently evolved into others. The term "folk", by the start of the 21st century, could cover [[Singer-songwriter|singer songwriters]], such as [[Donovan]] from Scotland and American [[Bob Dylan]], who emerged in the 1960s and much more. This completed a process to where "folk music" no longer meant only traditional folk music.&lt;ref name="Ronald D. Cohen 2006 pp. 1-2" /&gt;

Traditional folk music often includes [[Lyrics|sung words]], although folk [[instrumental music]] occurs commonly in [[dancing music|dance music]] traditions. [[Narrative verse]] looms large in the traditional folk music of many cultures. This encompasses such forms as traditional [[epic poetry]], much of which was meant originally for oral performance, sometimes accompanied by instruments. Many epic poems of various cultures were pieced together from shorter pieces of traditional narrative verse, which explains their episodic structure, repetitive elements, and their frequent ''[[in medias res]]'' plot developments. Other forms of traditional narrative verse relate the outcomes of [[battle]]s or describe [[Tragedy (event)|tragedies]] or [[natural disaster]]s.

Sometimes, as in the triumphant ''[[Song of Deborah]]'' found in the [[Bible|Biblical]] ''[[Book of Judges]]'', these songs celebrate victory. Laments for lost battles and wars, and the lives lost in them, are equally prominent in many traditions; these laments keep alive the cause for which the battle was fought. The narratives of traditional songs often also remember [[folk hero]]es such as [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] or [[Robin Hood]]. Some traditional song narratives recall [[supernatural]] events or mysterious deaths.

[[Hymn]]s and other forms of [[religious music]] are often of traditional and unknown origin. Western [[musical notation]] was originally created to preserve the lines of [[Gregorian chant]], which before its invention was taught as an oral tradition in [[monasticism|monastic]] communities. Traditional songs such as ''[[Green grow the rushes, O]]'' present religious lore in a mnemonic form, as do Western [[Christmas carol]]s and similar traditional songs.

[[Work song]]s frequently feature [[call and response (music)|call and response]] structures and are designed to enable the laborers who sing them to coordinate their efforts in accordance with the rhythms of the songs. They are frequently, but not invariably, composed. In the American [[armed force]]s, a lively oral tradition preserves [[jody call]]s ("Duckworth chants") which are sung while soldiers are on the march. Professional sailors made similar use of a large body of [[Sea shanty|sea shanties]]. [[Love poetry]], often of a tragic or regretful nature, prominently figures in many folk traditions. [[Nursery rhyme]]s and [[nonsense verse]] used to amuse or quiet children also are frequent subjects of traditional songs.

Music transmitted by word of mouth through a community, in time, develops many variants, because this kind of transmission cannot produce word-for-word and note-for-note accuracy. Indeed, many traditional singers are quite creative and deliberately modify the material they learn.

For example, the words of "[[I'm a Man You Don't Meet Every Day]]" (Roud 975) are known from a [[Broadside (music)|broadside]] in the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bodley24.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/acwwweng/ballads/image.pl?ref=Harding+B+20(69)&amp;id=08664.gif&amp;seq=1&amp;size=0 |title=Ballads Catalogue: Harding B 20(69) |publisher=Bodley24.bodley.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date is almost certainly before 1900, and it seems to be Irish. In 1958 the song was recorded in Canada (My Name is Pat and I'm Proud of That). Scottish traveler [[Jeannie Robertson]] from Aberdeen, made the next recorded version in 1961. She has changed it to make reference to "Jock Stewart", one of her relatives, and there are no Irish references. In 1976 Scottish artist [[Archie Fisher]] deliberately altered the song to remove the reference to a dog being shot. In 1985 [[The Pogues]] took it full circle by restoring all the Irish references.{{original research inline|date=November 2016}}

Because variants proliferate naturally, it is naïve to believe that there is such a thing as the single "authentic" version of a [[ballad]] such as "[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]". Field researchers in traditional song (see below) have encountered countless versions of this ballad throughout the English-speaking world, and these versions often differ greatly from each other. None can reliably claim to be the original, and it is possible that the "original" version ceased to be sung centuries ago.  Many versions can lay an equal claim to authenticity.

The influential folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] felt that these competing variants of a traditional song would undergo a process of improvement akin to biological [[natural selection]]: only those new variants that were the most appealing to ordinary singers would be picked up by others and transmitted onward in time. Thus, over time we would expect each traditional song to become aesthetically ever more appealing&amp;nbsp;— it would be collectively composed to perfection, as it were, by the community.

Literary interest in the popular ballad form dates back at least to [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]] and [[William Wordsworth]]. English Elizabethan and Stuart composers had often evolved their music from folk themes, the classical [[Suite (music)|suite]] was based upon stylised folk-dances, and [[Haydn and folk music|Joseph Haydn]]'s use of folk melodies is noted. But the emergence of the term "folk" coincided with an "outburst of national feeling all over Europe" that was particularly strong at the edges of Europe, where [[Self-determination|national identity]] was most asserted. [[Musical nationalism|Nationalist composers]] emerged in Central Europe, Russia, Scandinavia, Spain and Britain: the music of [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Bedřich Smetana|Smetana]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Manuel de Falla|de Falla]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]], and many others drew upon folk melodies.

While the loss of traditional folk music in the face of the rise of [[popular music]] is a worldwide phenomenon, it is not one occurring at a uniform rate throughout the world. The process is most advanced "where [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and [[Commercialization|commercialisation]] of culture are most advanced"&lt;ref&gt;Alison Vardy, et al., [http://www.celticharpsheetmusic.com/about/traditional-music.htm About Traditional Music Page], Celtic Harp Sheet Music site. Accessed 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but also occurs more gradually even in settings of lower technological advancement. However, the loss of traditional music is slowed in nations or regions where traditional folk music is a badge of cultural or national identity, for instance in the case of [[Bangladesh]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Pakistan]], [[Scotland]], [[Latvia]], [[Turkey]], [[Fado|Portugal]], [[Brittany]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Music of Greece|Greece]] and [[Music of Crete|Crete]]. Tourism revenue can provide a potent incentive to preserve local cultural distinctives. Local government often sponsors and promotes performances during tourist seasons, and revives lost traditions.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Early folk music, fieldwork and scholarship ===
Much of what is known about folk music prior to the development of audio recording technology in the 19th century comes from [[Field research|fieldwork]] and writings of scholars, collectors and proponents.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==== 19th-century Europe ====
Starting in the 19th century, academics and amateur scholars, taking note of the musical traditions being lost, initiated various efforts to preserve the music of the people. One such effort was the collection by [[Francis James Child]] in the late 19th century of the texts of over three hundred [[ballad]]s in the English and Scots traditions (called the [[Child Ballads]]), some of which predated the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Donaldson, 2011 page 13" /&gt;

Contemporaneously with Child, the Reverend [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] and later [[Cecil Sharp]] worked  to preserve a great body of English rural traditional song, music and dance, under the aegis of what became and remains the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society]] (EFDSS). Sharp campaigned with some success to have English traditional songs (in his own heavily edited and expurgated versions) to be taught to school children in hopes of reviving and prolonging the popularity of those songs. Throughout the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, American scholar Bertrand Harris Bronson published an exhaustive four-volume collection of the then-known variations of both the texts and tunes associated with what came to be known as the Child Canon. He also advanced some significant theories concerning the workings of oral-aural tradition.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Similar activity was also under way in other countries. One of the most extensive was perhaps the work done in [[Riga]] by [[Krisjanis Barons]], who between the years 1894 and 1915 published six volumes that included the texts of 217,996 Latvian folk songs, the ''Latvju dainas''. In Norway the work of collectors such as [[Ludvig Mathias Lindeman]] was extensively used by Edvard Grieg in his ''Lyric Pieces'' for piano and in other works, which became immensely popular.{{original research inline|date=November 2016}}

Around this time, composers of [[European classical music|classical music]] developed a strong interest in collecting traditional songs, and a number of outstanding composers carried out their own field work on traditional music. These included [[Percy Grainger]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] in England and [[Béla Bartók]] in Hungary. These composers, like many of their predecessors, both made arrangements of folk songs and incorporated traditional material into original classical compositions. The ''Latviju dainas'' are extensively used in the classical choral works of [[Andrejs Jurāns]], [[Jānis Cimze]], and [[Emilis Melngailis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==== North America ====
[[File:Cecil-sharp-appalachia-map.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Locations in Southern and Central Appalachia visited by the British folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] in 1916 (blue), 1917 (green), and 1918 (red). Sharp sought "old world" English and Scottish ballads passed down to the region's inhabitants from their British ancestors. He collected hundreds of such ballads, the most productive areas being the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina and the Cumberland Mountains of Kentucky.]]

The advent of [[audio recording]] technology provided folklorists with a revolutionary tool to preserve vanishing musical forms. The earliest American folk music scholars were with the [[American Folklore Society]] (AFS), which emerged in the late 1800s. Their studies expanded to include [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American music]], but still treated folk music as a historical item preserved in isolated societies as well.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;
In North America, during the 1930s and 1940s, the [[Library of Congress]] worked through the offices of traditional music collectors [[Robert Winslow Gordon]], [[Alan Lomax]] and others to capture as much North American field material as possible.  Lomax was the first prominent scholar to study distinctly American folk music such as that of cowboys and southern blacks. His first major published work was in 1911, ''Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads''.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; and was arguably the most prominent US folk music scholar of his time, notably during the beginnings of the folk music revival in the 1930s and early 1940s. Cecil Sharp also worked in America, recording the traditional songs of the Appalachian Mountains in 1916–1918 in collaboration with [[Maud Karpeles]] and [[Olive Dame Campbell]] and is considered the first major scholar covering American folk music.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Sharp are represented under other names by actors in the modern movie ''[[Songcatcher]]''.

One strong theme amongst folk scholars in the early decades of the 20th century was [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], the analysis of the diversity of folk music (and related cultures) based on regions of the US rather than based on a given song's historical roots. Later, a dynamic of class and circumstances was added to this.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 32–37&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent regionalists were literary figures with a particular interest in folklore. [[Carl Sandburg]] often traveled the U.S. as a writer and a poet.  He also collected songs in his travels and, in 1927, published them in the book ''[[The American Songbag]]''. "In his collections of folk songs, Sandburg added a class dynamic to popular understandings of American folk music. This was the final element of the foundation upon which the early folk music revivalists constructed their own view of Americanism. Sandburg's [[working class]] Americans joined with the [[Ethnic group|ethnically]], [[Race (human categorization)|racially]], and regionally diverse citizens that other scholars, public intellectuals, and folklorists celebrated their own definitions of the American folk, definitions that the folk revivalists used in constructing their own understanding of American folk music, and an overarching American identity".&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1930s, the study of folk music was primarily the province of scholars and collectors.  The 1930s saw the beginnings of larger scale themes, commonalities, themes and linkages in folk music developing in the populace and practitioners as well, often related to the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Donaldson, 2011, p 39-55"&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 39–55&lt;/ref&gt;  Regionalism and [[cultural pluralism]] grew as influences and themes.  During this time folk music began to become enmeshed with political and social activism themes and movements.&lt;ref name="Donaldson, 2011, p 39-55" /&gt; Two related developments were the U.S. Communist Party's interest in folk music as a way to reach and influence Americans,&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; and politically active prominent folk musicians and scholars seeing communism as a possible better system, through the lens of the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 67–70&lt;/ref&gt; [[Woody Guthrie]] exemplifies songwriters and artists with such an outlook.

Folk music festivals proliferated during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 44–52&lt;/ref&gt; [[President Franklin Roosevelt]] was a fan of folk music, hosted folk concerts at the [[White House]], and often patronized folk festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;  One prominent festival was [[Sarah Gertrude Knott]]'s [[National Folk Festival (United States)|National Folk Festival]], established in St. Louis, Missouri in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ann Williams, ''Staging Tradition: John Lair and Sarah Gertrude Knott'' (University of Illinois Press, 2006) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the sponsorship of [[the Washington Post]], the festival was held in Washington, DC at Constitution Hall from 1937–1942.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 103–04&lt;/ref&gt; The folk music movement, festivals, and the wartime effort were seen as forces for social goods such as democracy, cultural pluralism, and the removal of culture and race-based barriers.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 105–07&lt;/ref&gt;

The American folk music revivalists of the 1930s approached folk music in different ways.&lt;ref name="Donaldson87" /&gt; Three primary schools of thought emerged: "Traditionalists" (e.g. Sarah Gertrude Knott and [[John Lomax]]) emphasized the preservation of songs as artifacts of deceased cultures. "Functional" folklorists (e.g. Botkin and Alan Lomax) maintained that songs only retain relevance when utilized by those cultures which retain the traditions which birthed those songs.  "Left-wing" folk revivalists (e.g. Charles Seeger and Lawrence Gellert) emphasized music's role "in 'people's' struggles for social and political rights".&lt;ref name="Donaldson87"&gt;Donaldson, 2011, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the 1930s these and others had turned American folk music into a social movement.&lt;ref name="Donaldson87" /&gt;

Sometimes folk musicians became scholars and advocates themselves. For example, [[Jean Ritchie]] (born in 1922) was the youngest child of a large family from [[Viper, Kentucky]] that had preserved many of the old [[Appalachia]]n traditional songs. Ritchie, living in a time when the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] had opened up to outside influence, was university educated and ultimately moved to New York City, where she made a number of classic recordings of the family repertoire and published an important compilation of these songs.

In January 2012, the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]], with the Association for Cultural Equity, announced that they would release Lomax's vast archive of 1946 and later recording in digital form. Lomax spent the last 20 years of his life working on an [[Interactive Multimedia|interactive multimedia]] educational computer project he called the [[Cantometrics#Cantometrics as an educational tool|Global Jukebox]], which included 5,000 hours of sound recordings, 400,000 feet of [[film]], 3,000 [[videotape]]s, and 5,000 [[photograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/jan/31/the-global-jukeboxs-premiere/ "The Premiere of the Global Jukebox".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202124514/http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/jan/31/the-global-jukeboxs-premiere/ |date=2012-02-02 }} Radio interview with Don Fleming by [[John Hockenberry]] on [[Public Radio International|PRI]]'s [[The Takeaway]].&lt;/ref&gt;  As of March 2012, this has been accomplished.

[[File:Mbira dzavadzimu.jpg|thumb|The African [[lamellophone]], [[thumb piano]] or [[mbira]]]]
[[Africa]] is a vast continent and its [[Regions of Africa|regions]] and [[List of African countries|nations]] have distinct musical traditions. The [[List of Middle Eastern and North African folk music traditions|music of North Africa]] for the most part has a different history from [[Sub-Saharan African music traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;''GCSE Music&amp;nbsp;– Edexcel Areas of Study'', Coordination Group Publications, UK, 2006, p. 34, quoting examination board syllabus.&lt;/ref&gt;

The music and dance forms of the [[African diaspora]], including [[African American music]] and many [[Caribbean music|Caribbean]] genres like [[soca music|soca]], [[calypso music|calypso]] and [[Zouk]]; and [[Latin American music]] genres like the [[Samba (music)|samba]], [[Cuban rumba]], [[Salsa music|salsa]]; and other [[clave (rhythm)]]-based genres, were founded to varying degrees on the music of [[Slavery in Africa|African slaves]], which has in turn influenced [[African popular music]].

Many Asian civilizations distinguish between [[Art music|art]]/court/[[Classical music|classical]] styles and "folk" music, though cultures that do not depend greatly upon notation and have much anonymous art music must distinguish the two in different ways from those suggested by western scholars. For example, the late [[Alam Lohar]] is a good example of a classical South Asian folk singer of great repute.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Khunung Eshei/Khuland Eshei is an ancient folk song&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Manipur folk art performances mesmerise Madurai|url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/manipur-folk-art-performances-mesmerise-madurai/article3028787.ece|newspaper = The Hindu|date = 2006-12-03|access-date = 2015-12-21|issn = 0971-751X|language = en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Meitei people|Meiteis]] of [[Manipur]] who have maintained it for thousands of years. &lt;!--Several claims here need verifying: (1) that many Asian cultures differentiate art/court/classical styles and folk music, (2) that these cultures distinguish these categories in ways different from those suggested by Western scholars, and (3) that Alam Lohar is a good example of a singer of great repute.

===== Folk music of China =====
{{Further|Music of China#Folk music|Shijing|Yuefu}}
Archaeological discoveries date [[Culture of China|Chinese]] folk music back 7000 years; it is largely based on the [[pentatonic scale]].

[[Han dynasty|Han]] traditional weddings and funerals usually include a form of [[oboe]] called a [[suona]] and apercussive ensembles called a [[chuigushou]]. Ensembles consisting of [[mouth organ]]s ([[Sheng (instrument)|sheng]]), shawms ([[suona]]), [[flute]]s ([[Dizi (musical instrument)|dizi]]) and percussion instruments (especially [[yunluo]] [[gong]]s) are popular in northern villages; their music is descended from the imperial temple music of [[Beijing]], [[Xi'an]], [[Wutai shan]] and [[Tianjin]]. [[Xi'an]] drum music, consisting of wind and percussive instruments, is popular around Xi'an, and has received some commercial popularity outside of China. Another important instrument is the [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]], [[Chinese flute|pipes]], an ancient instrument that is ancestor of all Western [[free reed]] instruments, such as the [[accordion]]. Parades led by Western-type [[brass band]]s are common, often competing in volume with a shawm/chuigushou band.

In southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music|Nanguan]] is a genre of traditional ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with a love-stricken women. Further south, in [[Shantou]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]] and [[Chaozhou]], [[erxian]] and [[Guzheng|zheng]] ensembles are popular.[[Sizhu]] ensembles use [[flute]]s and bowed or plucked string instruments to make harmonious and melodious music that has become popular in the West among some listeners. These are popular in [[Nanjing]] and [[Hangzhou]], as well as elsewhere along the southern [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] area. Sizhu has been secularized in cities but remains spiritual in rural areas.[[Jiangnan Sizhu]] (silk and bamboo music from [[Jiangnan]]) is a style of instrumental music, often played by amateur musicians in tea houses in [[Shanghai]]; it has become widely known outside of its place of origin. [[Guangdong music (genre)|Guangdong Music]] or [[Guangdong music (genre)|Cantonese Music]] is instrumental music from [[Guangzhou]] and surrounding areas. It is based on Yueju (Cantonese Opera) music, together with new compositions from the 1920s onwards. Many pieces have influences from jazz and Western music, using syncopation and triple time. This music tells stories, myths and legends.

===== Traditional folk music of Sri Lanka =====
{{Main|Music of Sri Lanka}}
The genre of [[Sri Lanka]]n music is known as [[Music of Asia|Oriental music]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The art, music and dances of Sri Lanka derives from the elements of nature, and have been enjoyed and developed in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serendib.btoptions.lk/article.php?issue=29&amp;id=734 |title=The Percussive Force |publisher=Serendib.btoptions.lk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The music is of several types and uses only a few types of instruments.

The temple paintings and carvings used birds, elephants, wild animals, flowers and trees, and the [[Traditional 18 Dances]] display the dancing of birds and animals. For example:
* Mayura Wannama&amp;nbsp;– The dance of the [[peacock]]
* Hanuma Wannama&amp;nbsp;– The dance of the [[monkey]]
* Gajaga Wannama&amp;nbsp;– The dance of the [[elephant]]

Musical types include:
* Local drama music includes [[Kolam]], Nadagam and Noorthy types.  Kolam music is based on low country tunes primarily to accompany mask dance in [[exorcism]] rituals. It is considered less developed/evolved, true to the folk tradition and a preserving of a more ancient artform. It is limited to approximately 3–4 notes and is used by the ordinary people for pleasure and entertainment.
* Nadagam music is a more developed form of drama influenced from South Indian street drama which was introduced by some south Indian Artists.  [[Phillippu Singho]] from Negombo in 1824 Performed “[[Harishchandra Nadagama]]” in [[Hanguranketha Divisional Secretariat|Hnguranketha]] which was originally written in [[Telugu language|Telingu]] language. Later “Maname”, “Sanda kinduru” and few others were introduced. [[Don Bastian]] of [[Dehiwala]] introduced Noorthy firstly by looking at Indian dramas and then [[John de Silva|John De Silva]] developed it as did Ramayanaya in 1886.
* [[Sinhala light music]] is currently the most popular type of music in Sri Lanka and enriched with the influence of folk music, kolam music, nadagam music, noorthy music, [[film music]], classical music, western music, and others. Some artists visited India to learn music and later started introducing light music. [[Ananda Samarakoon|Ananda Samarakone]] was the pioneer of this and also composed the national anthem.
The classical [[Sinhalese Orchestra]] consists of five categories of instruments, but among the [[percussion instrument]]s, the [[drum]] is essential for dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.lk/srilanka/sightsandsoundsofsrilanka/srilankanmusicandsounds/index.htm |title=Sri Lankan Music Instrument &amp; sounds |publisher=Info.lk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211001325/http://www.info.lk/srilanka/sightsandsoundsofsrilanka/srilankanmusicandsounds/index.htm |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The vibrant beat of the rhythm of the drums form the basic of the dance. The dancers feet bounce off the floor and they leap and swirl in patterns that reflect the complex rhythms of the drum beat. This drum beat may seem simple on the first hearing but it takes a long time to master the intricate rhythms and variations, which the drummer sometimes can bring to a [[crescendo]] of intensity. There are six common types of drums falling within 3 styles (one-faced, two-faced, and flat-faced):
* The typical Sinhala Dance is identified as the [[Kandy]]an dance and the [[Geta Bera|Gatabera]] drum is indispensable to this dance.
* [[Yak Bera|Yak-bera]] is the demon drum or the, drum used in low country dance in which the dancers wear masks and perform devil dancing, which has become a highly developed form of art.
* The Dawula is a [[barrel]]-shaped drum, and it was used as a companion drum in the past, to keep strict time with the beat.
* The [[Thammattama]] is flat, two-faced drum. The drummer strikes the drum on the two surfaces on top with sticks, unlike the others where you drum on the sides. This is a companion drum to the afore mentioned Dawula.
* A small double headed hand drum, used to accompany songs. It is mostly heard in the poetry dances (vannam).
* The Rabana is a flat faced circular drum and comes in several sizes. The large Rabana has to be placed on the floor like a circular short-legged [[Table (furniture)|table]] and several people (especially the womenfolk) can sit around it and beat on it with both hands. This is used in festivals such as the [[Sinhalese New Year]] and ceremonies such as weddings. The resounding beat of the Rabana symbolizes the joyous moods of the occasion.  The small Rabana is a form of mobile drum beat, since the player carries it wherever he goes.

Other instruments include:
* The "[[Thalampata]]" – 2 small cymbals joined together by a string.
* The wind section, is dominated by an instrument akin to the [[clarinet]]. This is not normally used for the dances. This is important to note because the Sinhalese dance is not set to music as the western world knows it; rhythm is king.
* The [[flute]]s of metal such as silver &amp; brass produce [[Shrillness|shrill]] music to accompany Kandyan Dances, while the plaintive strains of music of the reed flute may pierce the air in devil-dancing. The [[conch-shell]] ([[Hakgediya]]) is another form of a natural instrument, and the player blows it to announce the opening of ceremonies of grandeur.
* The [[Ravanahatha]] (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilisation of Sri Lanka in the time of King Ravana. The bowl is made of cut coconut shell, the mouth of which is covered with goat hide. A dandi, made of bamboo, is attached to this shell. The principal strings are two: one of steel and the other of a set of horsehair. The long bow has jingle bells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2001/pix/PrintPage.asp?REF=/2011/02/09/art21.asp |title=&amp;#124;&amp;#124; Daily News Online Edition |location=Sri Lanka  |publisher=Dailynews.lk |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211004045/http://www.dailynews.lk/2001/pix/PrintPage.asp?REF=%2F2011%2F02%2F09%2Fart21.asp |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailynews.lk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/02/13/art01.asp |title=Artscope &amp;#124; Online edition of Daily News – Lakehouse Newspapers |publisher=Dailynews.lk |date=2008-02-13 |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211004038/http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/02/13/art01.asp |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
{{See also|Australian folk music|Indigenous Australian music}}
Folk song traditions were taken to Australia by early settlers from England, Scotland and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural [[outback]]. The rhyming songs, [[poems]] and tales written in the form of [[bush ballads]] often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in [[The Bush]], and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;Kerry O'Brien December 10, 2003 7:30 Report, [http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1007523.htm abc.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including [[John Meredith (folklorist)|John Meredith]] whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the [[National Library of Australia]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au" /&gt;

The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, [[sheep shearing]], wanderings, war stories, the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]], class conflicts between the landless working class and the [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] (landowners), and outlaws such as [[Ned Kelly]], as well as love interests and more modern fare such as [[Truck driver|trucking]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Smith, ''Singing Australian: A History of Folk and Country Music'' (Pluto Press Australia, 2005), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous bush ballad is "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", which has been called "the unofficial national anthem of Australia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/epubs/waltzingmatilda/ Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me?"], The National Library of Australia, retrieved 14 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indigenous Australian music]] includes the music of [[Australian Aborigine]]s and [[Torres Strait Islanders]], who are collectively called [[Indigenous Australians]]; it incorporates a variety of distinctive traditional [[music]] styles practiced by Indigenous Australian peoples, as well as a range of contemporary musical styles of and [[fusion (music)|fusion]] with European traditions as interpreted and performed by indigenous Australian artists. Music has formed an integral part of the [[society|social]], [[culture|cultural]] and ceremonial observances of these peoples, down through the millennia of their individual and collective histories to the present day. The traditional forms include many aspects of performance and [[musical instrument]]ation unique to particular regions or [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|Indigenous Australian groups]]. Equal elements of musical tradition are common through much of the [[Australia]]n continent, and even beyond. The culture of the Torres Strait Islanders is related to that of adjacent parts of [[New Guinea]] and so their music is also related. Music is a vital part of Indigenous Australians' cultural maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718052935/http://www.wilurarra.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=24 Wilurarra Creative (2010).

===== Celtic traditional music =====
{{See also|Folk music of Ireland|Folk music of Scotland}}
[[Celtic music]] is a term used by artists, record companies, music stores and music magazines to describe a broad grouping of [[musical genre]]s that evolved out of the folk musical traditions of the [[Celtic people]]s. These traditions include [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Music of the Isle of Man|Manx]], [[Music of Cornwall|Cornish]], [[Music of Wales|Welsh]], and [[Breton music|Breton]] traditions. [[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias|Asturian and Galician music]] is often included, though there is no significant research showing that this has any close musical relationship. [[Music of Brittany|Brittany]]'s Folk revival began in the 1950s with the "bagadoù" and the "kan-ha-diskan" before growing to world fame through [[Alan Stivell]]'s work since the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name=saw&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sawyers, June Skinner|title=Celtic Music: A Complete Guide|year=2000|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0306810077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ireland]], [[The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]] (although its members were all Irish-born, the group became famous while based in New York's Greenwich Village), [[The Dubliners]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[Planxty]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Pogues]], [[The Corrs]], [[The Irish Rovers]], and a variety of other folk bands have done much over the past few decades to revitalise and re-popularise [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]]. These bands were rooted, to a greater or lesser extent, in a tradition of Irish music and benefited from the efforts of artists such as [[Seamus Ennis]] and [[Peter Douglas Kennedy|Peter Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=saw /&gt;

In [[Scotland]], [[The Corries]], [[Silly Wizard]], [[Capercaillie (band)|Capercaillie]], [[Runrig]], [[Jackie Leven]], [[Julie Fowlis]], [[Karine Polwart]], [[Alasdair Roberts (musician)|Alasdair Roberts]], [[Dick Gaughan]], [[Wolfstone]], [[Boys of the Lough]], and [[The Silencers (band)|The Silencers]] have kept Scottish folk vibrant and fresh by mixing traditional Scottish and Gaelic folk songs with more contemporary genres. These artists have also been commercially successful in continental Europe and North America. There is an emerging wealth of talent in the Scottish traditional music scene, with bands such as [[Mànran]], [[Skipinnish]], Barluath and [[Breabach]] and solo artists such as Patsy Reid, [[Robyn Stapleton]] and Mischa MacPherson gaining many successes in recent years.

===== Central and Eastern Europe =====
{{See also|Music of Belarus|Hungarian folk music|Music of Moldova|Russian traditional music|Music of Ukraine|Bard (Soviet Union)|Music of Slovenia|Czech folklore}}
During the Communist era national folk dancing in the [[Eastern Bloc]] was actively promoted by the state. Dance troupes from Russia and Poland toured non-communist Europe from about 1937 to 1990. The [[Alexandrov Ensemble|Red Army Choir]] recorded many albums. Eastern Europe is also the origin of the Jewish [[Klezmer]] tradition.
[[File:Ľubomír Párička gra na dudach.webm|thumb|Ľubomír Párička playing bagpipes, Czech Republic]]
The [[polka]] is a central European [[dance]] and also a [[musical genre|genre]] of [[dancing music|dance music]] familiar throughout Europe and the Americas. It originated in the middle of the 19th century in [[Bohemia]]. Polka is still a popular genre of folk music in many European countries and is performed by folk artists in [[Poland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Netherlands]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Slovakia]]. Local varieties of this dance are also found in the [[Nordic countries]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Latin America]] (especially [[Mexico]]), and in the [[United States]].

German [[Lied|Volkslieder]] perpetuated by [[Liederhandschrift]]en manuscripts like ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' date back to medieval [[Minnesang]] and [[Meistersinger]] traditions. Those folk songs revived in the late 18th century period of [[German Romanticism]], first promoted by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and other advocates of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], later compiled by [[Achim von Arnim]] and [[Clemens Brentano]] (''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'') as well as by [[Ludwig Uhland]].

The [[Volksmusik]] and [[folk dance]]s genre, especially in the [[Alps|Alpine]] regions of [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] (''[[Ranz des Vaches|Kuhreihen]]'') and [[South Tyrol]], up to today has clinged on rustic communities against the backdrop of [[industrialisation]]—Low German [[sea shanty|shanties]] or the [[Wienerlied]] (''[[Schrammelmusik]]'') being notable exceptions. [[Music of Slovenia|Slovene]] folk music in [[Upper Carniola]] and [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styria]] also originated from the Alpine traditions. Traditional ''Volksmusik'' is not to be confused with commercial ''[[Volkstümliche Musik]]'' variations, strongly related to German [[Schlager music]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The Hungarian group [[Muzsikás]] played numerous American tours and participated in the Hollywood movie ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' while the singer [[Márta Sebestyén]] worked with the band [[Deep Forest]]. The Hungarian ''[[táncház]]'' movement, started in the 1970s, involves strong cooperation between musicology experts and enthusiastic amateurs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, traditional Hungarian folk music and folk culture barely survived in some rural areas of Hungary, and it has also begun to disappear among the [[Hungarians in Romania|ethnic Hungarians]] in [[Transylvania]]. The táncház movement revived broader folk traditions of music, dance, and costume together and created a new kind of music club. The movement spread to ethnic Hungarian communities elsewhere in the world.

The Balkan folk music was influenced by the mingling of Balkan ethnic groups in the period of [[Ottoman Empire]]. It comprises the [[music of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Music of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Music of Greece|Greece]], [[Music of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Music of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Music of Romania|Romania]], [[Music of the Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]], [[Music of Albania|Albania]], [[Music of Turkey|Turkey]], some of the historical states of [[Music of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] or the [[Music of Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] and geographical regions such as [[Music of Thrace|Thrace]]. Some music is characterised by complex rhythm.

A notable act is [[Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir|The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices]], which won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buchanan|first1=Donna A.|title=Performing democracy : Bulgarian music and musicians in transition|date=2006|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226078267|page=489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Past Winners |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&amp;field_nominee_work_value=mystere&amp;year=All&amp;genre=All |website=Grammy.com |publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6REsU6GWu?url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&amp;field_nominee_work_value=mystere&amp;year=All&amp;genre=All |archivedate=21 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= |date=2017-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordic folk music includes a number of traditions in [[Northern Europe]]an, especially [[Scandinavia]]n, countries.  The [[Nordic countries]] are generally taken to include [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]]. Sometimes it is taken to include [[Greenland]] and historically the [[Baltic countries]] of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].

The many regions of the Nordic countries share certain traditions, many of which have diverged significantly.  It is possible to group together the Baltic states (or, sometimes, only Estonia) and parts of northwest Russia as sharing cultural similarities, contrasted with Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Atlantic islands of, Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  Greenland's Inuit culture has its own musical traditions, influenced by Scandinavian culture.  Finland shares many cultural similarities with both the Baltic nations and the Scandinavian nations.  The Saami of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia have their own unique culture, with ties to the neighboring cultures.

[[Swedish folk music]] is a [[musical genre|genre]] of [[music]] based largely on [[folkloristics|folkloric]] collection work that began in the early 19th century in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky, David (2005) pp. 33–41. "Hidden Traditions: Conceptualizing Swedish Folk Music in the Twenty-First Century."  Ph.D. Dissertation, Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary instrument of Swedish folk music is the [[fiddle]].  Another common [[musical instrument|instrument]], unique to Swedish traditions, is the [[nyckelharpa]].  Most Swedish instrumental folk music is [[dance music]]; the signature music and dance form within Swedish folk music is the [[polska (dance)|polska]].  Vocal and instrumental traditions in Sweden have tended to share [[Tune (folk music)|tunes]] historically, though they have been performed separately.&lt;ref&gt;Jersild, Margareta (1976) pp. 53–66. "Om förhållandet mellan vokalt och instrumentalt i svensk folkmusik.  ''Svensk tidskrift för musikforskning'' 58(2): 53–66. {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning with the [[folk music revival]] of the 1970s, [[vocalist]]s and [[instrumentalist]]s have also begun to perform together in folk music [[musical ensemble|ensembles]].

==== Latin and South America ====
{{See also|Andean music|Cueca|Nueva canción}}
Folk music on the Americas consists on the encounter and union of three main musical types: European traditional music, traditional music of the American natives and tribal African music that arrived among the slaves, main differences consist on the particular type of each of these main slopes.

Particular case of Latin and South American music points to [[Andean music]] among other native musical styles (such as Caribbean, pampean and selvatic), Iberean music ([[Music of Spain|Spain]] and [[Music of Portugal|Portugal]]) and generally speaking [[Music of Africa|African]] tribal music, that fused together evolving in differentiated musical forms along South and Central America.

[[Andean music]] comes from the general area inhabited by [[Quechua people|Quechuas]], [[Aymara people|Aymaras]] and other peoples that roughly in the area of the [[Inca Empire]] prior to European contact. It includes folklore music of parts of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]]. Andean music is popular to different degrees across Latin America, having its core public in rural areas and among indigenous populations. The [[Nueva Canción]] movement of the 1970s revived the genre across Latin America and bought it to places where it was unknown or forgotten.

[[Nueva canción]] (Spanish for 'new song') is a movement and genre within [[Latin American music|Latin American]] and [[Iberia]]n music of folk music, folk-inspired music and socially committed music. It some respects its development and role is similar to the second folk music revival. This includes evolution of this new genre from traditional folk music, essentially contemporary folk music except that that English genre term is not commonly applied to it. Nueva cancion is recognized as having played a powerful role in the social upheavals in Portugal, Spain and Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s.

Nueva cancion first surfaced during the 1960s as "The Chilean New Song" in [[Chile]]. The musical style emerged shortly afterwards in Spain and other areas of Latin America where it came to be known under similar names. Nueva canción renewed traditional Latin American folk music, and was soon associated with revolutionary movements, the Latin American [[New Left]], [[Liberation Theology]], [[hippie]] and [[human rights]] movements due to political lyrics. It would gain great popularity throughout [[Latin America]], and is regarded as a precursor to [[Rock en español]].

[[Cueca]] is a family of musical styles and associated dances from [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], and [[Argentina]].

[[Trova]] and [[Son (music)|Son]] are styles of traditional [[Cuban music]] originating in the province of Oriente that includes influences from Spanish song and dance such as [[Bolero]] and [[contradanza]] as well as [[Afro-Cuban]] rhythm and percussion elements.

[[Moda de viola]] is the name designed to Brazilian folk music. Is often performed with a 6-string nylon acoustic guitar, but the most traditional instrument is the [[viola caipira]]. The songs basically detailed the hardness of life of those who work in the country. The themes are usually associated with the land, animals, folklore, impossible love and separation. Although there are some upbeat songs, most of them are nostalgic and melancholic.

Canada's traditional folk music is particularly diverse.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;  Even prior to liberalizing its immigration laws in the 1960s, Canada was ethnically diverse with dozens of different Indigenous and European groups present.  In terms of music, academics do not speak of a Canadian tradition, but rather ethnic traditions ([[Acadian music]], [[Irish-Canadian music]], [[Blackfoot music]], [[Innu music]], [[Inuit music]], [[Métis fiddle]], etc.) and later in Eastern Canada regional traditions ([[Music of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland music]], [[Cape Breton fiddling]], [[Quebecois music]], etc.)

{{quote|Traditional folk music of European origin has been present in Canada since the arrival of the first French and British settlers in the 16th and 17th centuries....They fished the coastal waters and farmed the shores of what became Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and the St Lawrence River valley of Quebec.

The fur trade and its [[voyageurs]] brought this farther north and west into Canada; later lumbering operations and lumberjacks continued this process.

Agrarian settlement in eastern and southern Ontario and western Quebec in the early 19th century established a favorable milieu for the survival of many Anglo-Canadian folksongs and broadside ballads from Great Britain and the US. Despite massive industrialization, folk music traditions have persisted in many areas until today. In the north of Ontario, a large Franco-Ontarian population kept folk music of French origin alive.

Populous Acadian communities in the Atlantic provinces contributed their song variants to the huge corpus of folk music of French origin centred in the province of Quebec. A rich source of Anglo-Canadian folk music can be found in the Atlantic region, especially Newfoundland. Completing this mosaic of musical folklore is the Gaelic music of Scottish settlements, particularly in Cape Breton, and the hundreds of Irish songs whose presence in eastern Canada dates from the Irish famine of the 1840s, which forced the large migrations of Irish to North America.&lt;ref name="Canada1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth Peacock, Carmelle Bégin |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/folk-music-emc/ &lt;!--Bot repaired link--&gt; |title=Folk music |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Knowledge of the [[history of Canada]]", wrote Isabelle Mills in 1974, "is essential in understanding the mosaic of Canadian folk song. Part of this mosaic is supplied by the folk songs of Canada brought by European and Anglo-Saxon settlers to the new land."&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;Mills, Isabelle (1974). http://cjtm.icaap.org/content/2/v2art5.html The Heart of the Folk Song, ''[[Canadian Journal for Traditional Music]]'' Vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt; She describes how the French colony at Québec brought French immigrants, followed before long by waves of immigrants from Great Britain, Germany, and other European countries, all bringing music from their homelands, some of which survives into the present day. Ethnographer and folklorist [[Marius Barbeau]] estimated that well over ten thousand French folk songs and their variants had been collected in Canada. Many of the older ones had by then died out in France.

Music as professionalized paid entertainment grew relatively slowly in Canada, especially remote rural areas, through the 19th and early 20th centuries.  While in urban music clubs of the [[dance hall]]/[[vaudeville]] variety became popular, followed by jazz, rural Canada remained mostly a land of traditional music. Yet when American radio networks began broadcasting into Canada in the 1920s and 1930s, the audience for Canadian traditional music progressively declined in favour of [[Nashville sound|American Nashville-style country music]] and urban styles like jazz.  The [[Americanization]] of Canadian music led the [[Canadian Radio League]] to lobby for a national public broadcaster in the 1930s, eventually leading to the creation of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) in 1936. The CBC promoted Canadian music, including traditional music, on its radio and later television services, but the [[modernism|mid-century craze for all things "modern"]] led to the decline of folk music relative to rock and pop. Canada was however influenced by the folk music revival of the 1960s, when  local venues such as the Montreal Folk Workshop, and other folk clubs and coffee houses across the country, became crucibles for emerging songwriters and performers as well as for interchange with artists visiting from abroad.

===== United States =====
{{See also|American folk music}}
American traditional music is also called roots music.  Roots music is a broad category of music including [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[old time music]], [[jug band]]s, [[Appalachian folk music|Appalachian folk]], [[blues]], [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American music]].  The music is considered American either because it is native to the [[United States]] or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck [[musicologist]]s as something distinctly new. It is considered "roots music" because it served as the basis of music later developed in the United States, including [[rock and roll]], contemporary folk music, [[rhythm and blues]], and [[jazz]]. Some of these genres are considered to be traditional folk music.
* [[Cajun music]], an emblematic [[music of Louisiana]], is rooted in the [[ballads]] of the French-speaking [[Acadian]]s of [[Canada]]. Cajun music is often mentioned in tandem with the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]]-based, [[Cajun]]-influenced [[zydeco]] form, both of [[Acadiana]] origin. These [[French Louisiana#Modern French Louisiana|French Louisiana]] sounds have influenced [[American popular music]] for many decades, especially [[country music]], and have influenced pop culture through mass media, such as television commercials.
* [[Appalachian music]] is the traditional music of the region of [[Appalachia]] in the Eastern United States. It derives from various European and African influences, including English [[ballad]]s, Irish and Scottish traditional music (especially [[fiddle]] music), hymns, and African-American [[blues]].  First recorded in the 1920s, Appalachian musicians were a key influence on the early development of [[Old-time music]], [[country music]], and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and were an important part of the [[American folk music revival]].  Instruments typically used to perform Appalachian music include the [[banjo]], [[American fiddle]], [[Appalachian dulcimer|fretted dulcimer]], and [[guitar]].&lt;ref name=olson&gt;Ted Olson, "Music&amp;nbsp;– Introduction".  ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1109–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early recorded Appalachian musicians include [[Fiddlin' John Carson]], [[Henry Whitter]], [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]], the [[Carter Family]], [[Clarence Ashley]], [[Frank Proffitt]], and [[Dock Boggs]], all of whom were initially recorded in the 1920s and 1930s. Several Appalachian musicians obtained renown during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Ola Belle Reed]], [[Lily May Ledford]], and [[Doc Watson]].  Country and bluegrass artists such as [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Roy Acuff]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Chet Atkins]], and [[Don Reno]] were heavily influenced by traditional Appalachian music.&lt;ref name=olson /&gt;  Artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Jerry Garcia]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] have performed Appalachian songs or rewritten versions of Appalachian songs.
* The [[Carter Family]] was a [[American folk music|traditional American folk music]] group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound impact on [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[Southern Gospel]], [[popular music|pop]] and [[rock music]]ians. They were the first vocal group to become country music stars; a beginning of the divergence of country music from traditional folk music. Their recordings of such songs as "[[Wabash Cannonball]]" (1932), "[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]" (1935), "[[Wildwood Flower]]" (1928), and "[[Keep On the Sunny Side]]" (1928) made them country standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Definitive Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock |last=Heatley |first=Michael |year=2007 |publisher=Star Fire |location=London |isbn=978-1844519965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Folk music revival" refers to either a period of renewed interest in traditional folk music, or to an event or period which transforms it; the latter usually includes a social activism component. A prominent example of the former is the British folk revival of approximately 1890–1920. The most prominent and influential example of the latter (to the extent that it is usually called "''the'' folk music revival") is the folk revival of the mid 20th century, centered in the English-speaking world which gave birth to contemporary folk music.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=shows 18–19}}  See the "[[Contemporary folk music]]" article for a description of this revival.

One earlier revival influenced western [[classical music]]. Such composers as [[Percy Grainger]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and [[Béla Bartók]], made field recordings or transcriptions of folk singers and musicians.

In Spain, [[Isaac Albéniz]] (1860–1909) produced piano works reflect his Spanish heritage, including the ''[[Suite Iberia]]'' (1906–1909). [[Enrique Granados]] (1867–1918) composed ''[[zarzuela]]'', Spanish light opera, and ''Danzas Españolas'' – Spanish Dances. [[Manuel de Falla]] (1876–1946) became interested in the [[cante jondo]] of Andalusian [[flamenco]], the influence of which can be strongly felt in many of his works, which include ''[[Nights in the Gardens of Spain]]'' and ''Siete canciones populares españolas'' ("Seven Spanish Folksongs", for voice and piano). Composers such as [[Fernando Sor]] and [[Francisco Tarrega]] established the [[guitar]] as Spain's national instrument.  Modern Spanish folk artists abound ([[Mil i Maria]], [[Russian Red]], et al.) modernizing while respecting the traditions of their forebears.

Flamenco grew in popularity through the 20th century, as did northern styles such as the Celtic music of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. French classical composers, from [[Bizet]] to [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], also drew upon Spanish themes, and distinctive Spanish genres became universally recognized.

Folk music revivals or [[roots revival]]s also encompass a range of phenomena around the world where there is a renewed interest in traditional music.  This is often by the young, often in the traditional music of their own country, and often included new incorporation of social awareness, causes, and evolutions of new music in the same style. [[Nueva canción]], a similar evolution of a new form of socially committed music occurred in several Spanish speaking countries.

=== First British folk revival ===
The "first" [[British folk revival]] was a [[roots revival]] which occurred approximately 1890–1920 and was marked by heightened interest in traditional music and its preservation. It arose from earlier developments, perhaps combined with changes in the nature of British identity, led to a much more intensive and academic attempt to record what was seen as a vanishing tradition, and is now usually referred to as the first English or British folk revival.

[[File:Franks casket 03.jpg|thumb|350px|The Franks Casket, as displayed in the [[British Museum]];  the front and lid]]
The '''Franks Casket''' (or the '''Auzon Casket''') is a small [[Anglo-Saxon]] whale's bone (not "whalebone" in the sense of [[baleen]]) chest from the early 8th century, now in the [[British Museum]].  The casket is densely decorated with knife-cut narrative scenes in flat two-dimensional low-[[relief]] and with inscriptions mostly in [[Anglo-Saxon runes]].  Generally reckoned to be of [[Northumbria]]n origin,&lt;ref&gt;The first considerable publication, by George Stephens, ''Old-Northern&lt;!--Old-Northern in original--&gt; Runic Monuments of Scandinavia and England'' (1866–1901) I-II:470-76, 921-23, III:200-04, IV:40-44, placed it in Northumbria and dated it to the 8th century.  Although A. S. Napier (1901) concurs with an early 8th-century Northumbrian origin,  [[Mercia]], and a 7th-century date, have also been proposed .{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The British Museum website (see external links) says Northumbria and "first half of the 8th century AD", as does Webster (2012a:92), "early part of the eighth century".&lt;/ref&gt; it is of unique importance for the insight it gives into early [[Anglo-Saxon art]] and culture.  Both identifying the images and interpreting the runic inscriptions has generated a considerable amount of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Vandersall summarises the previous scholarship as at 1972 in setting the casket into an art-historical, rather than linguistic context.  Mrs [[Leslie E. Webster|Leslie Webster]], former Keeper at the British Museum and the leading expert, has published a new short book on the casket (Webster 2012b).&lt;/ref&gt;

The imagery is very diverse in its subject matter and derivations, and includes a single Christian image, the [[Adoration of the Magi]], along with images derived from [[Roman Empire|Roman history]] ([[Emperor Titus]]) and [[Roman mythology]] ([[Romulus and Remus]]), as well as a depiction of at least one legend indigenous to the [[Germanic peoples]]: that of [[Wayland Smith|Weyland the Smith]].  It has also been suggested that there may be an episode from the [[Sigurd]] legend, an otherwise lost episode from the life of Weyland's brother [[Agilaz|Egil]], a Homeric legend involving [[Achilles]], and perhaps even an allusion to the legendary founding of England by [[Hengist and Horsa]].

The inscriptions "display a deliberate linguistic and alphabetic virtuosity; though they are mostly written in [[Old English]] and in runes, they shift into Latin and the Roman alphabet; then back into runes while still writing Latin".&lt;ref&gt;Webster (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are written upside down or back to front.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons (1999, 98-100) has an important discussion on the runes used in the Franks Casket.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Franks Casket right panel original on display in Bargello Museum.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Original of right panel, on display in [[Bargello Museum]], Florence]]
A monastic origin is generally accepted for the casket, which was perhaps made for presentation to an important secular figure, and [[Wilfrid]]'s foundation at [[Ripon]] has been specifically suggested,&lt;ref&gt;Webster (2012a:97); Ripon was suggested by Wood, who was able to connect Ripon with Brioude through the Frankish scholar Frithegod "active in both areas in the middle tenth century (Wood 1990, 4-5)" - Webster (1991) from BM collection database.&lt;/ref&gt; The post-medieval history of the casket before the mid-19th century was unknown until relatively recently, when investigations by [[William Henry James Weale|W. H. J. Weale]] revealed that the casket had belonged to the church of Saint-Julien, [[Brioude]] in [[Haute Loire]] (upper Loire region), France; it is possible that it was looted during the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Vandersall 1972:24 note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was then in the possession of a family in [[Auzon]], a village in Haute Loire.  It served as a sewing box until the silver hinges and fittings joining the panels were traded for a silver ring. Without the support of these the casket fell apart. The parts were shown to a Professor Mathieu from nearby [[Clermont-Ferrand]], who sold them to an antique shop in [[Paris]], where they were bought in 1857 by Sir [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]], who subsequently donated the panels in 1867 to the British Museum, where he was Keeper of the British and Medieval collections. The missing right end panel was later found in a drawer by the family in Auzon and sold to the [[Bargello Museum]], [[Florence]], where it was identified as part of the casket in 1890. The British Museum display includes a cast of it.&lt;ref&gt;Webster (1991), from British Museum collection database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and interpretations==
[[File:Lipsanoteca di Brescia.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The [[Brescia Casket]], one of the best survivals of the sort of [[Late Antique]] models the Franks Casket emulates. Late 4th century]]
The casket is 22.9&amp;nbsp;cm long, 19&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 10.9&amp;nbsp;cm high – 9 × {{frac|7|1|2}} by {{frac|5|1|8}} inches, and can be dated from the language of its inscriptions and other features to the first half of the 8th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Measurements from British Museum Collections Database webpage.  For date see note to lead.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are other inscriptions, "[[Titulus (inscription)|tituli]]" identifying some figures that are not detailed below and appear within the image field. The mounts in precious metal that were undoubtedly originally present are missing, and it is "likely" that it was originally painted in colour.&lt;ref&gt;Webster (2012a:92).&lt;/ref&gt;

The chest is clearly modelled on [[Late Antique]] ivory caskets such as the [[Brescia Casket]];&lt;ref&gt;Webster (1991); Webster (2012a:92); Webster (2012b:30-33).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Veroli Casket]] in the [[V&amp;A Museum]] is a Byzantine interpretation of the style, in revived classical style, from about 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Webster (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leslie E. Webster|Leslie Webster]] regards the casket as probably originating in a monastic context, where the maker "clearly possessed great learning and ingenuity, to construct an object which is so visually and intellectually complex. ... it is generally accepted that the scenes, drawn from contrasting traditions, were carefully chosen to counterpoint one another in the creation of an overarching set of Christian messages.  What used to be seen as an eccentric, almost random, assemblage of pagan Germanic and Christian stories is now understood as a sophisticated programme perfectly in accord with the Church's concept of university history".  It may have been intended to hold a book, perhaps a [[psalter]], and intended to be presented to a "secular, probably royal, recipient"&lt;ref&gt;Webster (2012a:96-97). (both quoted, in that order)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Front panel===
[[File:Franks Casket front.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|340x340px|Detail of front panel, depicting the Germanic legend of [[Wayland the Smith]] and the Christian [[adoration of the Magi]]]]
The front panel, which originally had a lock fitted, depicts elements from the Germanic legend of [[Wayland the Smith]] in the left-hand scene, and the Adoration of the Magi on the right.  Wayland (also spelled Weyland or Welund) stands at the extreme left in the forge where he is held as a slave by King [[Niðhad]], who has had his [[hamstring]]s cut to hobble him. Below the forge is the headless body of Niðhad's son, whom Wayland has killed, making a goblet from his skull; his head is probably the object held in the tongs in Wayland's hand.  With his other hand Wayland offers the goblet, containing drugged beer, to [[Beaduhild]], Niðhad's daughter, whom he then rapes when she is unconscious. Another female figure is shown in the centre; perhaps Wayland's helper, or Beaduhild again.  To the right of the scene Wayland (or his brother) catches birds; he then makes wings from their feathers, with which he is able to escape.&lt;ref&gt;This scene was first explained by Sophus Bugge, in Stephens (1866-1901, Vol. I, p. lxix), as cited by Napier (1901, p. 368).  See also Henderson (1971, p. 157).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sharp contrast, the right-hand scene shows one of the most common Christian subjects depicted in the art of the period; however here "the birth of a hero also makes good sin and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;Webster (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Three Magi]], identified by an inscription (ᛗᚫᚷᛁ, "magi"), led by the large star, approach the enthroned [[Madonna and Child]] bearing the traditional gifts. A goose-like bird by the feet of the leading magus may represent the [[Holy Spirit]], usually shown as a dove, or an angel.  The human figures, at least, form a composition very comparable to those in other depictions of the period. [[Richard A. Fletcher|Richard Fletcher]] considered this contrast of scenes, from left to right, as intended to indicate the positive and benign effects of conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, R. ''The Conversion of Europe: From Paganism to Christianity 371-1386AD'' London 1997 pp269-270 {{ISBN|0002552035}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the panel runs the following alliterating inscription, which does not relate to the scenes but is a riddle on the material of the casket itself as whale bone, and specifically from a [[stranded whale]]:

===Left panel===
[[File:Franks Casket left panel.jpg|thumb|320px|The left panel, depicting [[Romulus and Remus]]]]
The left panel depicts the mythological twin founders of Rome, [[Romulus and Remus]], being suckled by a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] lying on her back at the bottom of the scene.  The same wolf, or another, stands above, and there are two men with spears approaching from each side.  The inscription reads:

|}
Carol Neuman de Vegvar (1999) observes that other depictions of Romulus and Remus are found in [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]]n art and coinage (for example the very early [[Undley bracteate]]).&lt;ref&gt;Another Anglo-Saxon bone plaque, existing only in a fragment at the [[Castle Museum, Norwich]], which was found at [[Larling]], [[Norfolk]], also shows Romulus and Remus being suckled, with other animal ornament.  (Wilson 1984, p. 86).&lt;/ref&gt;  She suggests that because of the similarity of the story of Romulus and Remus to that of [[Hengist and Horsa]], the brothers who were said to have founded England, "the legend of a pair of outcast or traveller brothers who led a people and contributed to the formation of a kingdom was probably not unfamiliar in the 8th-century Anglo-Saxon milieu of the Franks Casket and could stand as a reference to destined rulership."&lt;ref&gt;Neuman de Vegvar (1999, pp. 265–6)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rear panel===
[[File:Franks casket 01.jpg|thumb|320px|The rear panel, depicting a scene from the [[First Jewish-Roman War]]]]
The rear panel depicts the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Taking of Jerusalem]] by [[Titus]] in the [[First Jewish-Roman War]]. The inscription is partly in Old English and partly in Latin, and part of the Latin portion is written in Latin letters (indicated below in upper case letters), with the remainder transcribed phonetically into runic letters. Two isolated words stand in the lower corners.&lt;ref&gt;Page (1999, pp. 176–7).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the centre of the panel is a depiction of a building, probably representing the [[Temple of Jerusalem]].

In the upper left quadrant, the Romans, led by Titus in a helm with a sword, attack the central building. The associated text reads 'ᚻᛖᚱᚠᛖᚷᛏᚪᚦ | +ᛏᛁᛏᚢᛋᛖᚾᛞᚷᛁᚢᚦᛖᚪᚢ' (in Latin transliteration 'herfegtaþ | +titusendgiuþeasu', and if normalised to Late West Saxon 'Hēr feohtaþ Tītus and Iūdēas'): 'Here Titus and the Jews fight'.

In the upper right quadrant, the Jewish population flee, casting glances backwards. The associated text, which is in Latin and partly uses Latin letters and partly runes, reads 'hicfugianthierusalim | ᚪᚠᛁᛏᚪᛏᚩᚱᛖᛋ' (in normalised Classical Latin: 'hic fugiant Hierusalim habitatores'): 'Here the inhabitants flee from Jerusalem'.

In the lower left quadrant, a seated judge announces the judgement of the defeated Jews, which as recounted in [[Josephus]] was to be sold into [[slavery]]. The associated text, in the bottom left corner of the panel, reads 'ᛞᚩᛗ' (if normalised to Late West Saxon: 'dōm'): 'judgement'.

In the lower right quadrant, the slaves/hostages are led away, with the text, in the bottom right corner of the panel, reading 'ᚷᛁᛋᛚ' (if normalised to Late West Saxon: 'gīsl'): 'hostages'.

===Lid===
[[File:Franks Casket Lid Detail.jpg|330px|thumb|The lid of the casket is said by some to depict an otherwise lost legend of Egil; Egil fends off an army with bow and arrow while the female behind him may be his wife Olrun.  Others interpret it as a scene from the Trojan War involving Achilles]]

The lid as it now survives is incomplete.  Leslie Webster has suggested that there may have been [[relief]] panels in silver making up the missing areas.  The empty round area in the centre probably housed the metal boss for a handle.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor, Arthur. ''Bone, Antler, Ivory and Horn'', [[Ashmolean Museum]], 1984, {{ISBN|0-7099-3507-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7099-3507-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o0MflvaPJ3MC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=Franks+Casket&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UsejS6PXB9GF4QbCorCBCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Franks%20Casket&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;
The lid shows a scene of an archer, labelled ᚫᚷᛁᛚᛁ or ''Ægili'', single-handedly defending a fortress against a troop of attackers, who from their larger size may be giants.

In 1866, [[Sophus Bugge]] "followed up his explanation of the Weland picture on the front of the casket with the suggestion that the bowman on the top piece is [[Agilaz|Egil]], Weland's brother, and thinks that the 'carving tells a story about him of which we know nothing.  We see that he defends himself with arrows.  Behind him appears to sit a woman in a house; possibly this may be Egil's spouse [[Olrun|Ölrún]].'"&lt;ref&gt;Napier (1901, p. 366), quoting Bugge in Stephens (1866-1901, vol. I, p. lxx).&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Norse mythology]], Egil is named as a brother of Weyland (Weland), who is shown on the front panel of the casket. The ''[[Þiðrekssaga]]'' depicts Egil as a master archer and the ''[[Völundarkviða]]'' tells that he was the husband of the swan maiden [[Olrun]]. The [[Pforzen buckle]] inscription, dating to about the same period as the casket, also makes reference to the couple Egil and Olrun (''Áigil andi Áilrun'').  The British Museum webpage and Leslie Webster concur, the former stating that "The lid appears to depict an episode relating to the Germanic hero Egil and has the single label 'aegili' = 'Egil'."&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Collections Database webpage, accessed Jan. 26, 2013; Webster (2012), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josef Strzygowski]] (quoted by Viëtor 1904) proposed instead that the lid represents a scene pertaining to the fall of [[Trojan War|Troy]], but did not elaborate.  Karl Schneider (1959) identifies the word ''Ægili'' on the lid as an Anglo-Saxon form of the name of the Greek hero [[Achilles]].  As nominative singular, it would indicate that the archer is Achilles, while as dative singular it could mean either that the citadel belongs to Achilles, or that the arrow that is about to be shot is meant for Achilles.  Schneider himself interprets the scene on the lid as representing the massacre of [[Andromache]]'s brothers by Achilles at Thebes in a story from the [[Iliad]], with Achilles as the archer and Andromache's mother held captive in the room behind him.  Amy Vandersall (1975) confirms Schneider's reading of ''Ægili'' as relating to Achilles, but would instead have the lid depict the Trojan attack on the Greek camp, with the Greek bowman [[Teucer]] as the archer and the person behind the archer (interpreted as a woman by most other authors) as Achilles in his tent.

Other authors see a Biblical or Christian message in the lid:  Marijane Osborn finds that several details in [[Psalms|Psalm]] 90, "especially as it appears in its Old English translation, ... may be aligned with details in the picture on the lid of the casket:  the soul shielded in verse 5 and safely sheltered in the ... sanctuary in verse 9, the spiritual battle for the soul throughout, the flying missiles in verse 6 and an angelic defender in verse 11."&lt;ref&gt;Osborn (1991b: 262-3). [[Psalms|Psalm]] 90 in the Vulgate bible and Old English translation referenced by Osborn corresponds to Psalm 91 in Protestant and Hebrew bibles.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leopold Peeters (1996:44) proposes that the lid depicts the defeat of [[Agila]], the [[Arianism|Arian]] [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] ruler of [[Hispania]] and [[Septimania]], by Roman Catholic forces in 554 A.D.  According to Gabriele Cocco (2009), the lid most likely portrays the story of [[Elisha]] and [[Jehoash of Israel|Joas]] from ''2 Kings'' 13:17, in which the prophet Elisha directs King Joas to shoot an arrow out an open window to symbolise his struggle against the Syrians:  "Hence, the ''Ægili''-bowman is King Joas and the figure under the arch is Elisha.  The prophet would then be wearing a hood, typical of Semitic populations, and holding a staff."&lt;ref&gt;Cocco (2009: 30).&lt;/ref&gt;  Webster (2012b:46-8) notes that the two-headed beast both above and below the figure in the room behind the archer also appears beneath the feet of Christ as King David in an illustration from an 8th-century Northumbrian manuscript of [[Cassiodorus]], ''Commentary on the Psalms.''

===Right panel===
[[File:Franks Casket right panel.jpg|thumb|320px|The replica right panel in London]]
This, the Bargello panel, has produced the most divergent readings of both text and images, and no reading of either has achieved general acceptance.  At left an animal figure sits on a small rounded mound, confronted by an armed and helmeted warrior.  In the centre a standing animal, usually seen as a horse, faces a figure, holding a stick or sword, who stands over something defined by a curved line.  At right are three figures; the two outer ones perhaps hold fast the one in the middle.

However, a definitive translation of the lines has met with difficulty, partly because the runes are run together without separators between words, and partly because two letters are broken or missing.  As an extra challenge for the reader, on the right panel only, the vowels are encrypted with a simple substitution cipher.  Three of the vowels are represented consistently by three invented symbols.  However, two additional symbols represent both ''a'' and ''æ'', and according to Page, "it is not clear which is which or even if the carver distinguished competently between the two."&lt;ref&gt;Page (1999: 87)&lt;/ref&gt; Reading one rune, transcribed by Page and others as ''r'' but which is different from the usual ''r''-rune, as a rune for ''u'', Thomas A. Bredehoft has suggested the alternative reading

: ''Her Hos sitæþ &amp;nbsp; on hæum bergæ''
: ''agl[.] drigiþ, &amp;nbsp; swæ hiri Eutae gisgraf''
: ''sæuden sorgæ &amp;nbsp; and sefa tornæ.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Bredehoft, 'Three New Cryptic Runes on the Franks Casket', ''Notes and Queries'', 58.2 (2011), 181-83, doi:10.1093/notesj/gjr037.&lt;/ref&gt;

: Here sits Hos on [or in] the high hill [or barrow]; 
: she endures agl[.] as the Jute appointed to her, 
: a ''sæuden'' of sorrow and troubles of mind.

Page writes, "What the scenes represent I do not know.  Excited and imaginative scholars have put forward numbers of suggestions but none convinces."&lt;ref&gt;Page (1999: 178).&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these theories are outlined below.

====Sigurd and Grani?====
[[File:Sigurd saga rune stone.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sigurd stones|Sigurd saga runestone]] from eastern Sweden depicts Sigurd's horse Grani]]
Elis Wadstein (1900) proposed that the right panel depicts the Germanic legend of [[Sigurd]], known also as [[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]], being mourned by his horse Grani and wife Guthrun. Eleanor Clark (1930) added, "Indeed, no one seeing the figure of the horse bending over the tomb of a man could fail to recall the words of the ''Guthrunarkvitha'' (II,5):
: The head of Grani was bowed to the grass,
: The steed knew well his master was slain."&lt;ref&gt;Translation of H.A. Bellows, Oxford Univ. Press, 1926, as cited by Clark (1930, p. 339).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Clark admits that this is an "extremely obscure legend,"&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1930, p. 340)&lt;/ref&gt; she assumes that the scene must be based on a Germanic legend, and can find no other instance in the entire Norse mythology of a horse weeping over a dead body.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1930, p. 342)&lt;/ref&gt;  She concludes that the small, legless person inside the central mound must be Sigurd himself, with his legs gnawed off by the wolves mentioned in Guthrun's story.  She interprets the three figures to the right as Guthrun being led away from his tomb by his slayers Gunnar and Hogne, and the female figure before Grani as the Norn-goddess [[Urðr|Urd]], who passes judgement on the dead.  The warrior to the left would then be Sigurd again, now restored to his former prime for the afterlife, and "sent rejoicing on his way to [[Glæsisvellir|Odainsaker]], the realms of bliss for deserving mortals.  The gateway to these glittering fields is guarded by a winged dragon who feeds on the imperishable flora that characterised the place, and the bodyless cock crows lustily as a kind of eerie ''genius loci'' identifying the spot as Hel's wall."&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1930, pp. 352–3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Sigurd-Grani thesis remains the most widely accepted interpretation of the right panel, Arthur Napier remarked already in 1901, "I remain entirely unconvinced by the reasons [Wadstein] puts forward, and believe that the true explanation of the picture has still to be found."&lt;ref&gt;Napier (1901: 379 n.2).  Napier (p. 364) reports that Dr. Söderberg of Lund had anticipated Wadstein's proposal already in the ''Academy'', referring to a brief mention in the Notes and News section of The Academy, A Weekly Review of Literature, Science and Art, August 2nd 1890, p.90, col.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hengist and Horsa?====
[[File:Flag of Kent.svg|thumb|160px|The [[White horse of Kent]] is said to be based on the banner of Horsa]]
A.C. Bouman (1965) and Simonne d'Ardenne (1966)&lt;ref&gt;D'Ardenne independently put forward Bouman's Hengist and Horsa reading, which she only discovered as her own article was going to press.&lt;/ref&gt; instead interpret the mournful stallion (Old English ''hengist'') at the centre of the right panel as representing Hengist, who, with his brother Horsa, first led the Old Saxons, Angles, and Jutes into Britain, and eventually became the first Anglo-Saxon king in England, according to both [[Bede]]'s [[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'']] and the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''.  The miniature person inside the burial mound he grieves over would then be Horsa, who died at the battle of ''Ægelesthrep'' in 455 A.D. and was buried in a flint tumulus at [[Fort Horsted|Horsted]] near [[Aylesford]]. Bouman suggests that the female mourner could then be Hengist's famous daughter [[Rowena|Renwein]].

Bouman and d'Ardenne identify the strange creature on the left with the head of a horse, the clothing and posture of a man, and the wings of a spirit, as Horsa again, this time as a spirit seated on his own burial mound.  Horsa (whose name means ''horse'' in Old English) would then be the "Hos" referred to in the panel's inscription as sitting on a "sorrow-mound."  They note that there is a miniature horse in each corner of the panel, in keeping with its theme of two famous "horses."

====The Deity of the Grove?====
[[File:Tangelgarda Odin.jpg|thumb|left| The [[valknut|Tängelgårde Stone]] from [[Gotland]], Sweden depicts two [[valknut]]s between the horse's legs, as on the right panel of the Franks Casket]]
Usually ''her hos sitæþ'' is read, "here sits the horse".  However, Wilhelm Krause (1959) instead separates ''herh'' (temple) and ''os'' (divinity).  Alfred Becker (1973, 2002), following Krause, interprets ''herh'' as a sacred grove, the site where in pagan days the [[Æsir]] were worshipped, and ''os'' as a goddess or valkyrie.  On the left, a warrior "has met his fate in guise of a frightening monster... As the outcome, the warrior rests in his grave shown in the middle section.  There (left of the mound) we have a horse marked with two trefoils, the divine symbols.... Above the mound we see a chalice and right of the mound a woman with a staff in hand.  It is his Valkyrie, who has left her seat and come to him in the shape of a bird.  Now she is his beautiful ''sigwif'', the hero's benevolent, even loving companion, who revives him with a draught from that chalice and takes him to Valhalla.  The horse may be ''[[Sleipnir]]'', Woden's famous stallion."&lt;ref&gt;Becker (2000, unpaginated section "H-panel (Right Side) - The Picture").&lt;/ref&gt;

Krause and Becker call attention to the significance of the two trefoil marks or  [[valknutr]]  between the stallion's legs, which denote the realm of death and can be found in similar position on picture stones from Gotland, Sweden like the [[Tängelgårda stone]] and the [[Stora Hammars stones]]. Two other pictures of the Franks Casket show this symbol.  On the front it marks the third of the [[Magi]], who brings [[myrrh]].  It also appears on the lid, where according to Becker, [[Valhalla]] is depicted.

====The Madness of Nebuchadnezzar?====
[[File:William Blake - Nebuchadnezzar (Tate Britain).jpg|thumb|right|[[Nebuchadnezzar (Blake)|“Nebuchadnezzar” by William Blake]] ([[Tate Gallery|Tate]]) ]]  
Leopold Peeters (1996) proposes that the right panel provides a pictorial illustration of the biblical ''[[Book of Daniel]]'', ch. 4 and 5:  The wild creature at the left represents [[Nebuchadnezzar]] after he “was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild asses and ate grass like cattle.”&lt;ref&gt;Peeters (1996: 29), citing ''Daniel'' 5:21.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure facing him is then the “watchful one” who decreed Nebuchadnezzar’s fate in a dream (4.13-31), and the quadruped in the centre represents one of the wild asses with whom he lived.  Some of the details Peeters cites are specific to the [[Daniel (Old English poem)|Old English poem based on ''Daniel'']].

According to Peeters, the three figures at the right may then represent [[Belshazzar]]’s wife and concubines, "conducting blasphemous rites of irreverence (''Dan.'' 5:1-4, 22)."&lt;ref&gt;Peeters (1996: 31).&lt;/ref&gt;  The corpse in the central burial mound would represent Belshazzar himself, who was murdered that night, and the woman mourning him may be the queen mother.  The cryptic runes on this panel may be intended to invoke the mysterious writing that appeared on the palace wall during these events.

====The Death of Balder?====

[[Image:Hotherus and wood maidens by Froelich.jpg|left|thumb|Hother and the wood maidens by Lorenz Frølich]]

David Howlett (1997) identifies the illustrations on the right panel with the story of the death of [[Baldr|Balder]], as told by the late 12th-century Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in his [[Gesta Danorum]].&lt;ref&gt;Schneider (1959) similarly identified the right panel with Saxo’s version of the death of Balder.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Saxo, Balder’s rival [[Höðr|Hother]] meets three women in a dank wood late at night, who provide him with a belt and girdle that will enable him to defeat Balder.  Hother wounds Balder, who dies three days later and is buried in a mound.

Howlett identifies the three figures at the right with the three wood maidens (who may be the three [[Norns]]), and the shrouded man within the central mound with Balder.  “The woman to the right of the mound is [[Hel (being)|Hel]], Saxo’s [[Proserpina]], prophesying Balder’s death and condemning [[Woden]] to sorrow and humiliation.  The stallion to the left of the mound is Balder’s father Woden.”&lt;ref&gt;Howlett (1997: 280-1).&lt;/ref&gt;  In Saxo’s story, Woden then begets a second son, Boe ([[Váli|Bous or Váli]]), to avenge Balder’s death.  Howlett interprets the warrior at left as Boe, and “one infers that the mound is depicted twice and that the stallion mourning in the centre of the panel is identical with the figure seated at the left end, where he retains his horse’s head and hooves.”&lt;ref&gt;Howlett (1997: 281).&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Penance of Rhiannon?====
[[File:Charlotte Guest Rhiannon.jpg|thumb|Rhiannon riding in Arbeth, from ''The Mabinogion'', translated by Charlotte Guest, 1877]]

Ute Schwab (2008), following Heiner Eichner (1991), interprets the left and central scenes on the right panel as relating to the Welsh legend of [[Rhiannon]].  According to the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', a medieval collection of ancient Welsh stories, Rhiannon was falsely accused of murdering and eating her infant son [[Pryderi]], who, according to Schwab, is represented by the swaddled infant in the central scene.  As a penance, she was required, as depicted in the scene on the left,
"to sit beside the [[mounting block|horse-block]] outside the gates of the court for seven years, offering to carry visitors up to the palace on her back, like a beast of burden....  Rhiannon's horse-imagery and her bounty have led scholars to equate her with the Celtic horse-goddess [[Epona]]."&lt;ref&gt;Green (1993, p. 30).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Satan and the Nativity?====
[[File:9821 - Milano - Sant'Ambrogio - Sarcofago di Stilicone - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 25-Apr-2007.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity scene]], 4th-century Roman Christian sarcophagus]]
Austin Simmons (2010) parses the frame inscription into the following segments:
:''herh os-sitæþ   on hærm-bergæ''
:''agl drigiþ   swæ hiri er tae-gi-sgraf''
:''sær-den sorgæ   and sefa-tornæ''

This he translates, "The idol sits far off on the dire hill, suffers abasement in sorrow and heart-rage as the den of pain had ordained for it." Linguistically, the segment ''os-'' represents the verbal prefix ''oþ-'' assimilated to the following sibilant, while in the b-verse of the second line ''er'' "before" is an independent word before a three-member verbal compound, ''tae-gi-sgraf''. The first member ''tae-'' is a rare form of the particle-prefix ''to-''.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription refers specifically to the scene on the left end of the casket's right side. According to Simmons, the 'idol' (''herh'') is [[Satan]] in the form of an ass, being tortured by a personified Hell in helmet. The scene is a reference to the apocryphon ''[[Acts of Pilate|Decensus ad Inferos]]'', a popular medieval text translated into Anglo-Saxon. In one version of the story of the [[Harrowing of Hell]], a personified Hell blames Satan for having brought about the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], which has allowed Christ to descend to Hell's kingdom and free the imprisoned souls. Therefore, Hell tortures Satan in retribution.  Simmons separates the other scenes on the right side and interprets them as depictions of the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] and the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Runological and numerological considerations==
[[File:Franks Casket front, words Fisc Flodu.jpg|thumb|right|The inscription "''Fisc Flodu'' …" on the front of the Franks Casket alliterates on the F-rune ᚠ ''feoh'', which connotes wealth or treasure]]
Each Anglo-Saxon runic letter had an [[acrophony|acrophonic]] Old English name, which gave the rune itself the connotations of the name, as described in the [[Old English rune poem]].  The inscriptions on the Franks Casket are alliterative verse, and so give particular emphasis to one or more runes on each side.   According to Becker (1973, 2002), these tell a story corresponding to the illustrations, with each of the scenes emblematic of a certain period of the life and afterlife of a warrior-king:  The front inscription alliterates on both the F-rune ᚠ ''feoh'' (wealth) and the G-rune ᚷ ''gyfu'' (gift), corresponding to the jewellery produced by the goldsmith Welund and the gifts of the three Magi.  “In this box our warrior hoarded his treasure, golden rings and bands and bracelets, jewellery he had received from his lord, … which he passed to his own retainers…  This is ''feohgift'', a gift not only for the keep of this or that follower, but also to honour him in front of his comrade-in-arms in the hall.”&lt;ref&gt;Becker (2002, unpaginated, section ''The Casket – a Warrior’s Life'')&lt;/ref&gt;  The Romulus and Remus inscription alliterates on the R-rune ᚱ ''rad'' (journey or ride), evoking both how far from home the twins had journeyed and the owner’s call to arms.  The Titus side stresses the T-rune ᛏ ''[[Tyr|Tiw]]'' (the Anglo-Saxon god of victory), documenting that the peak of a warrior-king’s life is glory won by victory over his enemies.  The right side alliterates first on the H-rune ᚻ ''hagal'' (hail storm or misfortune) and then on the S-rune ᛋ ''sigel'' (sun, light, life), and illustrates the hero’s death and ultimate salvation, according to Becker.

Becker also presents a numerological analysis of the inscriptions, finding 72 = 3 x 24 signs on the front and left panels, and a total of 288 or 12 x 24 signs on the entire casket.  All these numbers are multiples of 24 = 3 x 8, the magical number of runes in the [[elder futhark]], the early  continental runic alphabet preserved within the extended [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]].  "In order to reach certain values the carver had to choose quite unusual word forms and ways of spelling which have kept generations of scholars busy."&lt;ref&gt;Becker (2002), unpaginated section ''F-panel (Front) - Number and value of the runes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Osborn (1991a, 1991b) concurs that the rune counts of 72 are intentional.  However, "whereas [Becker] sees this as indicating pagan magic, I see it as complementing such magic, as another example of the Franks Casket artist adapting his pagan materials to a Christian evangelical purpose in the mode of ''interpretatio romana''.  The artist manipulates his runes very carefully, on the front of the casket supplementing their number with dots and on the right side reducing their number with [[bind rune|bindrunes]], so that each of the three inscriptions contains precisely seventy-two items.... The most obvious Christian association of the number seventy-two, for an Anglo-Saxon if not for us, is with the missionary disciples appointed by Christ in addition to the twelve apostles....  The number of these disciples is mentioned in scripture only in Luke 10, and there are two versions of this text;  whereas the Protestant Bible says that Christ appointed a further seventy disciples, the Vulgate version known to the Anglo-Saxons specifies seventy-two.  In commenting on that number, [[Bede]] associates it with the mission to the Gentiles (that is, "all nations"), because seventy-two is the number of nations among the Gentiles, a multiple of the twelve tribes of Israel represented by the twelve apostles."&lt;ref&gt;Osborn (1991b: 260-1).  Howlett (1997: 283) concurs with Becker and Osborn that "The carver counted his characters."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4567">'''Glowlab''' was an [[artist-run initiative]] that produced and presented experimental work related to [[city|cities]] and [[psychogeography]], including interactive artworks and projects, events, exhibitions, and artists' gatherings. [[Brooklyn]] artist and curator [[Christina Ray]] launched Glowlab in 2002 as an experimental, web-based arts lab to support the visibility and expression of artists within her community. Ray produced exhibitions and projects including street-based performance work and site specific interventions both in her Williamsburg loft and in the greater urban environment. Glowlab moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan in 2008, opening an exhibition space at the edge of [[SoHo]]. As an innovative model advancing a niche collective of artists, thinkers and technologists, Glowlab produced over a dozen solo and group exhibitions, artist talks and performances. In early 2010, Ray re-launched Glowlab under her own name, continuing to focus on contemporary art, technology and creative projects examining the nature and psychology of the built environment.

In 2003, Glowlab's Christina Ray and David Mandl co-founded [[Psy-Geo-Conflux]], currently known as the Conflux Festival, which takes place annually in [[New York City]].  The Village Voice described Conflux as a "network of maverick artists and unorthodox urban investigators… making fresh, if underground, contributions to pedestrian life in New York City, and upping the ante on today’s fight for the soul of high-density metropolises.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0319,zimmerman,43875,1.html Public Notice: Psychogeographers Navigate New York City's Changing Landscape] by Bryan Zimmerman, the Village Voice May 7–13, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects and artists ==

In addition to the annual Conflux Festival, Glowlab initiated a number of projects that focus on the exploration of public space.

One Block Radius, produced for [[The New Museum]] in 2004 by Christina Ray and David Mandl created a web based "psychogeographic portrait of a single [[Bowery]] block" with the help of media contributions from artists and the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/nyclife/0509,bpress,61613,15.html The Last Days of Loserville] by Joy Press The Village Voice, March 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in Manhattan.  Open Lab, at Art Interactive in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was a nine-week series of "deceptively simple, playful investigations of site and the social fabric of Central Square, Cambridge".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhizomes.net/issue13/dignazio/index.html A Case for Boston as a Liquid not a Solid] by Catherine D'Ignazio, Rhizomes 13&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Southern Exposure (art space)|Southern Exposure]] in San Francisco, Ray and Kurt Bigenho invited people to step away from the intensive social networking of internet sites like [[Myspace]] and [[Friendster]], and engage in non-social meetups in real space in their project Noso.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/riff_blog/archives/2007/03/3935_say_it_isnt_so.html Say It Isn't So: No, It's NoSo] by Rose Miller, Mother Jones, January 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists and groups who have been associated with Glowlab include Wilfried Hou Je Bek, Bethany Bristow, D. Jean Hester, [[Brian House]], Emily Conrad, Catherine D'Ignazio (aka Kanarinka), [[Steve Lambert (artist)|Steve Lambert]], David Mandl, Roberto Mollá, [[Marisa Olson]], Mark Price, [[Sal Randolph]], Jesse Shapins, [[Swoon (artist)|Swoon]], Holly Tavel, Jessica Thompson, [[Lee Walton]], and [[Wooster Collective]].

'''Gold leaf''' is [[gold]] that has been hammered into thin sheets by [[goldbeating]] and is often used for [[gilding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/gold-leaf|title=gold leaf {{!}} art|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold leaf is available in a wide variety of [[carat (purity)|karat]]s and shades. The most commonly used gold is 22-karat yellow gold.

Gold leaf is a type of [[metal leaf]], but the term is rarely used when referring to gold leaf. The term ''metal leaf'' is normally used for thin sheets of metal of any color that do not contain any real gold. Pure gold is 24 karats. Real, yellow gold leaf is approximately 91.7% pure gold. Silver-colored [[white gold]] is about 50% pure gold.

Layering gold leaf over a surface is called '''gold leafing''' or [[gilding]]. Traditional [[water gilding]] is the most difficult and highly regarded form of gold leafing. It has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years and is still done by hand.

==In art==
[[File:goldleaf.jpg|left|thumb|22k gold leaf applied with an ox hair brush during the process of [[gilding]]]]

Gold leaf is sometimes used in art in a "raw" state, without a gilding process. In cultures including the [[European Bronze Age]] it was used to wrap objects such as [[bulla (amulet)|bullae]] simply by folding it tightly over, and the Classical group of [[gold lunula]]e are so thin, especially in the centre, that they might be classed as gold leaf.  It has been used in [[jewellery]] in various periods, often as small pieces hanging freely.

Gold leaf has traditionally been most popular and most common in its use as [[gilding]] material for decoration of art (including [[statue]]s and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] [[icon]]s) or the [[picture frame]]s that are often used to hold or decorate paintings, [[mixed media]], small objects (including [[jewelry]]) and paper art. [[Gold glass]] is gold leaf held between two pieces of glass, and was used for decorated Ancient Roman vessels, where some of the gold was scraped off to form an image, as well as [[tesserae]] gold mosaics.  "Gold-ground" paintings, where the background of the figures was all in gold, was introduced in mosaics in later [[Early Christian art]], and then used in [[icon]]s and Western panel paintings until the late [[Middle Ages]]; all techniques use gold leaf. Gold leaf is also used in [https://royalthaiart.com/painting-catalog/buddha-painting/ Buddhist art] to decorate statues and symbols. Gold leafing can also be seen on domes in religious and public architecture. "Gold" frames made without leafing are also available for a considerably lower price, but traditionally some form of gold or metal leaf was preferred when possible and gold leafed (or silver leafed) moulding is still commonly available from many of the companies that produce commercially available moulding for use as picture frames.

==In architecture==
[[File:Rom, Basilika Santa Maria Maggiore, Innenansicht.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]]]]
Gold leaf has long been an integral component of [[architecture]] to designate important structures, both for aesthetics and because gold's non-reactive nature provides a protective finish.

Gold in architecture became an integral component of Byzantine and Roman churches and basilicas in 400 AD, most notably [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome. The church was built by [[Pope Sixtus III]] and is one of the earliest examples of [[Mosaic gold|gold mosaics]]. The mosaics were made of stone, tile or glass backed on gold leaf walls, giving the church a beautifully intricate backdrop. The Athenian marble columns supporting the nave are even older, and either come from the first basilica, or from another antique Roman building; thirty-six are marble and four granite, pared down, or shortened to make them identical  by Ferdinando Fuga, who provided them with identical gilt-bronze capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beny|Gunn|1981|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th century [[campanile]], or bell tower, is the highest in Rome, at 240 feet, (about 75 m.). The basilica's 16th-century coffered ceiling, designed by [[Giuliano da Sangallo]], is said to be gilded with gold that [[Christopher Columbus]] presented to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]], before being passed on to the Spanish pope, [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles A. Coulombe]], ''Vicars of Christ'', p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; The apse mosaic, the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], is from 1295, signed by the [[Franciscan]] friar, [[Jacopo Torriti]].
[[File:Senate ceiling.jpg|thumb|right|Gold leaf and painted coffers of the Senate chamber ceiling in [[Centre Block]]]]
In [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], The [[Centre Block]] is the main building of the Canadian parliamentary complex on Parliament Hill, containing the House of Commons and Senate chambers, as well as the offices of a number of members of parliament, senators, and senior administration for both legislative houses. It is also the location of several ceremonial spaces, such as the Hall of Honour, the Memorial Chamber, and Confederation Hall.
In the east wing of the Centre Block is the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] chamber, in which are the [[throne]]s for the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] and her [[List of Canadian monarchs#List of royal consorts of Canada|consort]], or for the [[Governor General of Canada|federal viceroy]] and his or her [[Viceregal consort of Canada|consort]], and from which either the sovereign or the governor general gives the [[Speech from the Throne]] and grants [[Royal Assent]] to bills passed by parliament. &lt;ref name=Senate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collineduparlement-parliamenthill.gc.ca/histoire-history/centre/senat-senate-eng.html |title=A Treasure to Explore &gt; Parliament Hill &gt; History of the Hill &gt; Centre Block &gt; Senate |author=Public Works and Government Services Canada |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |accessdate=2008-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914000132/http://www.collineduparlement-parliamenthill.gc.ca/histoire-history/centre/senat-senate-eng.html |archivedate=2009-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The overall color in the Senate chamber is red, seen in the upholstery, carpeting, and draperies, and reflecting the color scheme of the [[Palace of Westminster#Lords Chamber|House of Lords]] in the United Kingdom; red was a royal color, associated with the Crown and [[hereditary peer]]s. Capping the room is a [[Gilding|gilt]] ceiling with deep octagonal [[coffer]]s, each filled with [[Heraldry|heraldic]] symbols, including maple leaves, fleur-de-lis, [[Lion (heraldry)#Lions rampant|lions rampant]], [[clàrsach]], [[Welsh Dragon]]s, and [[Lion (heraldry)#Lions passant|lions passant]]. This plane rests on six pairs and four single [[pilaster]]s, each of which is capped by a [[caryatid]], and between which are [[clerestory]] windows. Below the windows is a continuous architrave, broken only by [[baldachin]]s at the base of each of the above pilasters.
On the east and west walls of the chamber are eight [[mural]]s depicting scenes from the First World War; painted in between 1916 and 1920, they were originally part of the more than 1,000 piece Canadian War Memorials Fund, founded by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|the Lord Beaverbrook]], and were intended to hang in a specific memorial structure. However, the project never eventuated, and the works were stored at the [[National Gallery of Canada]] until 1921, when the Parliament requested a loan for some of the collection's oil paintings to display in the Centre Block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/warpaintings/intro-e.asp| title=The War Paintings in the Senate Chamber &gt; Introduction| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/warpaintings/foreword-e.asp| title=The War Paintings in the Senate Chamber &gt; Foreword| author=Library of Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murals have remained in the Senate chamber ever since.
[[File:Crit Photo.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the [[Criterion Restaurant]]]]


In [[London]], the [[Criterion Restaurant]] is an opulent building facing [[Piccadilly Circus]] in the heart of London. It was built by architect [[Thomas Verity]] in [[Neo-Byzantine]] style for the partnership [[Felix Spiers|Spiers]] and [[Christopher Pond|Pond]] who opened it in 1873. One of the restaurant’s most famous features is the 'glistering' ceiling of gold mosaic, coved at the sides and patterned all over with lines and ornaments in blue and white [[tesserae]]. The wall decoration accords well with the real yellow gold leaf ceiling, incorporating semi-precious stones such as [[jade]], [[mother of pearl]], [[turquoise]] being lined with warm [[marble]] and formed into [[Blind arcade|blind arcades]] with semi-elliptical [[Arch|arches]] resting on slender octagonal columns, their unmolded capitals and the impost being encrusted with [[Monreale|goldground mosaic]] &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols29-30/pt1/pp251-270#fnn37 |title=Survey of London: Volumes 29 and 30, St James Westminster, Part 1 |work=British History Online |date=1960 |accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gold leaf adorns the wrought iron gates surrounding the [[Palace of Versailles]] in France, when refinishing the gates nearly 200 years after they were torn down during the [[French Revolution]], it required hundreds of kilograms of gold leaf to complete the process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 1989|title="L'ameublement de la chambre de Louis XIV à Versailles de 1701 à nos jours".|url=|journal=gazette des Beaux-Arts (6th ed.)|volume=|pages=79-104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Culinary uses==
Gold leaf (as well as other [[metal leaf]] such as [[vark]]) is sometimes used to decorate food or drink, typically to promote a perception of luxury and high value; however, it is flavorless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hopkins | first1 = Jerry | title = Extreme Cuisine: The Weird &amp; Wonderful Foods that People Eat | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2004 | pages = 289–292 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DJDKaxEEfYgC&amp;dq | accessdate = 2013-08-15 | isbn = 978-0794602550}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is occasionally found in [[dessert]]s and [[confectionery]], including chocolates, honey and ''[[Indian sweets|mithai]]''. In India it may be used effectively as a garnish, with thin sheets placed on a main dish, especially on festive occasions. When used as an additive to food, gold has the [[E-number]] E175.  A traditional (centuries old) artisan variety of green tea contains pieces of gold leaf; 99% of this kind of tea is produced in [[Kanazawa]], [[Japan]], a historic city for [[samurai]] craftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp/dentou_e/way/tea/try/trye.html|title=Japanese Culture/The Way/Tea ceremony/Let's Try|website=www.city.kanazawa.ishikawa.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The city is also home to a gold leaf museum, [[Kanazawa Yasue Gold Leaf Museum]].

[[File:Infuehr-Oesterreich-Gold-trocken-effekt.jpg|thumb|100px|Austrian Gold sparkling wine with gold leaves]] 
In [[Continental Europe]] liquors with tiny floating pieces of gold leaf are known of since the late 16th century; originally the practice was regarded as medicinal.  Well-known examples are [[Danziger Goldwasser]], originally from [[Gdańsk]], Poland, which has been produced since at least 1598, [[Gold Strike (drink)|Goldstrike]] from [[Amsterdam]], [[Schwabacher Goldwasser (drink)|Goldwasser]] from [[Schwabach]] in [[Germany]], and the Swiss [[Goldschläger]], which is perhaps the best known in the United States.

'''''History and Class Consciousness: Studies in Marxist Dialectics''''' ({{lang-de|Geschichte und Klassenbewußtsein – Studien über marxistische Dialektik}}) is a 1923 book by the Hungarian philosopher [[György Lukács]], in which the author re-emphasizes [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s influence on [[Karl Marx]], analyses the concept of class consciousness, and attempts a philosophical justification of [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]].

The book helped to create [[Western Marxism]] and is the work for which Lukács is best known. Some of Lukács's pronouncements in ''History and Class Consciousness'' have become famous. Nevertheless, it was condemned in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and Lukács later repudiated its ideas, and came to believe that in it he had confused Hegel's concept of alienation with that of Marx. It has been suggested that the concept of reification as employed in [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927) shows the strong influence of ''History and Class Consciousness'', though such a relationship remains disputed.

==Summary&lt;!--'Hegelian Marxism' redirects here--&gt;==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based primarily on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
Lukács attempts a philosophical justification of Bolshevism, stressing the distinction between actual class consciousness and "ascribed" class consciousness, the attitudes the [[proletariat]] would have if they were aware of all of the facts.&lt;ref name="McLellanarticle" /&gt; Marx's idea of class consciousness is seen as a thought which directly intervenes into social being.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Žiž11|Žižek 2011]]. p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming to return to Marx's methodology,&lt;ref name="Bien" /&gt; Lukács re-emphasizes Hegel's influence on Marx, emphasizes [[dialectics]] over [[materialism]], makes concepts such as [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] central to his theory,&lt;ref name="McLellanarticle"&gt;[[#McL05|McLellan 2005]]. p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt; and argues for the primacy of the concept of totality.&lt;ref name="Bien" /&gt; Lukács depicts Marx as an eschatological thinker.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fro75|Fromm 1975]]. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He develops a version of '''Hegelian Marxism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; that contrasted with the emerging Soviet interpretations of Marxism based on the work of [[Georgi Plekhanov]] and the dialectics of nature inspired by [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref name="Bien"&gt;[[#Bie99|Bien 1999]]. p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay "What is Orthodox Marxism?", Lukács argues that methodology is what distinguishes [[Marxism]]: even if all its substantive propositions were rejected, it would remain valid because of its distinctive method.&lt;ref name="Wrightetal"&gt;[[#Wri92|Wright 1992]]. pp. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lukács, "Orthodox Marxism, therefore, does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of Marx’s investigations. It is not the ‘belief’ in this or that thesis, nor the exegesis of a ‘sacred’ book. On the contrary, orthodoxy refers exclusively to method. It is the scientific conviction that [[dialectical materialism]] is the road to truth and that its methods can be developed, expanded and deepened only along the lines laid down by its founders."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luk00|Lukács 2000]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lukács maintains that it is through Marx's use of the dialectic that capitalist society can be seen as essentially reified and the proletariat viewed as the true subject of history and the only possible salvation of humanity. All truth, including Marx's materialist conception of history itself, is to be seen in relation to the proletariat's historical mission. Truth, no longer given, must instead be understood in terms of the relative moments in the process of the unfolding of the real union of theory and praxis: the totality of social relations. This union must be grasped through proletarian consciousness and directed party action in which subject and object are one.&lt;ref name="Bien" /&gt;

''History and Class Consciousness'' was republished in 1967 with a new preface in which Lukács described the circumstances that allowed him to read Marx's newly deciphered ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' in 1930, two years before their publication. After reading them, Lukács concluded that in ''History and Class Consciousness'' he had made a basic mistake, that of confusing Hegel's and Marx's respective concepts of alienation. To Hegel, alienation is the objectivity of nature, but for Marx, it refers not to natural objects but to what happens to the products of labor when social relationships make them commodities or capital.&lt;ref name="Colletti"&gt;[[#Col92|Colletti 1992]]. pp. 16-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==
Extremely influential,&lt;ref&gt;[[#McL95|McLellan 1995]]. p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; ''History and Class Consciousness'' is the work for which Lukács is best known.&lt;ref name="McLellanarticle" /&gt; Lukács' pronouncements in "What is Orthodox Marxism?" have become famous.&lt;ref name="Wrightetal" /&gt; ''History and Class Consciousness'' helped to create Western Marxism in Europe and America, and influenced [[Karl Mannheim]]'s work on the sociology of knowledge, but led to Lukács being condemned in Eastern Europe and the [[Soviet Union]]. In response to the Communist attack on his work, Lukács wrote an essay on [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s views (''Lenin: A Study in the Unity of His Thought'').&lt;ref name="Bien" /&gt; In his later career, Lukács repudiated the ideas of ''History and Class Consciousness'', in particular the belief in the proletariat as a "[[subject (philosophy)|subject]]-[[object (philosophy)|object]] of history" (1960 Postface to the French translation). As late as 1925-1926, he still defended these ideas, in an unfinished manuscript, which he called ''Tailism and the Dialectic.'' It was not published until 1996 in Hungarian and English in 2000 under the title ''A Defence of History and Class Consciousness''.

The political scientist [[David McLellan (political scientist)|David McLellan]] writes that the publication of Marx's key earlier writings vindicated Lukács' interpretation of Marx.&lt;ref name="McLellanarticle" /&gt; The philosopher [[Lucio Colletti]] believes that although the publication of those writings disproved some of the assumptions of ''History and Class Consciousness'', the problem of the nature of alienation remained valid.&lt;ref name="Colletti" /&gt; Lukács' work was a crucial text for the French [[Situationist International|Situationist]] [[Guy Debord]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hus01|Hussey 2001]]. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; although Debord wrote in ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967) that Lukács, by arguing that the Bolshevik party provided a mediation between theory and practice that enabled proletarians to determine events within their organization instead of being spectators of them, was describing the opposite of how it functioned in reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Deb94|Debord 1994]]. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Jürgen Habermas's initial understanding of Marx came through Lukács's work, while [[Tom Rockmore]] has described it as "brilliant."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roc89|Rockmore 1989]]. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have compared Lukács to Heidegger, though the existence of any relationship between the two has been disputed.&lt;ref name="Steiner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hemming" /&gt; The Marxist philosopher [[Lucien Goldmann]] argues in his posthumously published ''[[Lukacs and Heidegger: Towards a New Philosophy]]'' (1973) that the concept of reification as employed in Heidegger's ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927) showed the strong influence of ''History and Class Consciousness'' (1923), although Heidegger never mentions Lukács in his writing and Laurence Paul Hemming, writing in ''Heidegger and Marx'' (2013), finds the suggestion that Lukács influenced Heidegger to be highly unlikely at best.&lt;ref name="Hemming"&gt;[[#Hem13|Hemming 2013]]. pp. 33-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[George Steiner]] writes that Lukács, as the author of ''History and Class Consciousness'', shares with Heidegger "a commitment to the concrete, historically existential quality of human acts of perception and intellection."&lt;ref name="Steiner"&gt;[[#Ste89|Steiner 1989]]. pp. 74-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary geneticist [[Richard Lewontin]], the neurobiologist [[Steven Rose]], and the psychologist [[Leon Kamin]] draw on Lukács's ideas in ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ros90|Rose 1990]]. pp. 76, 296.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Frederick Crews]] writes that in ''History and Class Consciousness'', Lukács "made a fatefully ingenious attempt to abolish, through metaphysical prestidigitation, the newly apparent chasm between Marx's historical laws and the triumph of Bolshevism."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cre86|Crews 1986]]. p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The economists M. C. Howard and J. E. King praise the sophistication of Lukács' Hegelian understanding of how to specify the interests of the proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;[[#How92|Howard 1992]]. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] describes the Lukács of ''History and Class Consciousness'' as, "the philosopher of Lenin's historical moment". Žižek believes that Lukács' achievement is to bring together the topic of commodity fetishism and reification with the topic of the Party and revolutionary strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Žiž11|Žižek 2011]]. pp. 196-7, 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Sun - '''Khorshid Khanom''' - is a character in many artistic and cultural practices and settings. [[Sun]], was the symbol of an aperture which divine light was flowing through it on earth. The sun with face of a beautiful Iranian lady with big captivating eyes and unibrows, probably as a symbol for beauty of [[goddess]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6443">The '''Limburg Staurotheke''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], stauros “[[cross]]” and theke “[[container]]”) is an example of a [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] [[reliquary]]. It was crafted sometime in the mid to late 10th century in [[Constantinople]]. The box measures 48 centimeters by 35 centimeters and has a depth of 6 centimeters. This reliquary design was common in Byzantium beginning in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Holger A.|title=Eastern Objects and Western Desires: Relics and Reliquaries between Byzantium and the West|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|date=2004|volume=58|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Limburg Staurotheke is currently housed in [[Germany]] in the Limburg an der Lahn.

== Description and History ==
[[File:Intérieur de Limbourg.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Limburg Staurotheke with the True Cross reliquary in place.]]
The Limburg Staurotheke consists of two parts that were made at separate times. The removable, double-armed cross was made first and holds seven fragments of the [[True Cross]] in the middle of the cross where its main set of arms meets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hostetler|first1=Bradley A.|title=The Limburg Staurotheke: A Reassessment|journal=Anthanor|date=2012|volume=30|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cross is made out of [[sycamore]] wood and is entirely covered in gilded [[silver]] and embellished with gemstones and pearls. Inscribed on the back of the cross is the following verse:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ševčenko|first1=Nancy|title=The Celebration of the Saints in Byzantine Art and Liturgy (Burlington, VT: Ashgate Variorum, 2013), 2–3.|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Variorum|location=Burlington, Vermont|pages=2–3}} Translated from Medieval Greek.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|text=God stretched out his hands upon the wood,
gushing forth through it the energies of life.
And Constantine and Romanos the emperors
have with the addition of radiant stones and pearls
made this same full of wonder.
Upon it Christ formerly smashed the gates of hell,
giving new life to the dead. 
And the crowned ones who have now adorned it,
crush with it the temerities of the barbarians
}}

The two emperors mentioned in the inscription are [[Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos]] and [[Romanos II]], his son. They ruled jointly from 945 to 959, meaning that the cross would have been constructed during their rule.

[[File:Couvercle de Limbourg.jpg|thumb|The lid of the Limburg Staurotheke]]
The box and its sliding, removable lid were made second and is designed to hold the cross reliquary in the center of the box. Surrounding the cross are ten [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] panels that depict angels wearing court outfits. Next to the angels are 10 more panels that each depict a pair of either [[cherubim]] or [[seraphim]]. The panels depicting the cherubim and seraphim are the containers that hold ten relics and each compartment has an inscription that identifies the [[relic]] housed inside. Six relics are Passion relics and are ascribed to [[Christ (title)|Christ]], three to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], and one to [[John the Baptist]]. The relics in the compartments of the theke are:
* The swaddling clothes of Jesus
* The sponge used to give Christ water during his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]
* The crown of thorns worn by Christ during his crucifixion
* The winding sheet Christ was wrapped in while in his tomb
* The towel used by Christ to wash the feet of his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] during the [[Last Supper]]
* The purple himation worn by Christ during his crucifixion (mentioned in John 19:2)
* The belt of the Virgin Mary from [[Chalkoprateia]]
* The belt of the Virgin Mary brought from Zela
* The maphorion of the Virgin Mary
* Locks of hair from St. John the Baptist

[[File:LM Staurothek Pantokrator.JPG|thumb|Close up of [[Christ Pantocrator]] on the middle enamel panel of the lid of the Limburg Staurotheke]]

The lid of the box, like the cross and inner compartments of the theke, is covered in gilded silver and lavishly decorated with gemstones. It features nine enamel panels that portray the [[Deesis]], a scene that depicts Christ in a throne, accompanied by the Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist and surrounded by angels. On the lid of the Limburg Staurotheke, Christ is seen in the middle panel, with John the Baptist to his left and the Virgin Mary to his right. The [[archangels]] [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] stand next to John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary.  The top and bottom panels portray the twelve Apostles. On an outer border framing the panels are the busts of eight unidentified figures, though they are likely images of four military saints and four important church leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ševčenko|first1=Nancy|title=The Celebration of the Saints in Byzantine Art and Liturgy|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Variorum|location=Burlington, Vermont|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theke itself features an inscription on the outer rim that states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hahn|editor1-first=Cynthia|editor2-last=Klein|editor2-first=Holger A.|title=Saints and Sacred Matter: The Cult of Relics in Byzantium and Beyond|date=2015|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection|location=Washington D.C.|page=246}} Translated from Medieval Greek.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|text=No beauty had He, who was hanged on the Wood,
and yet, even in death, Christ surpassed all beauty.
While He had no comely form, He embellished my
unsightly face disfigured by sin and transgression.
For, though He was God, He suffered in mortals’ nature.
Since Basil the Proedros highly revered Him,
he greatly embellished the box of the wood,

on which He was stretched and embraced all creation.
}}  

The inscription reveals that [[Basil Lekapenos]] was the benefactor of the staurotheke. Basil was the bastard son of Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] and was made a eunuch likely as a child. He would become a powerful figure in the imperial court. Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] gave him the title of ''[[proedros]]'' in 963. The theke was likely made between 963 and 985, when Basil was exiled from the imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pentcheva|first1=Bissera V.|title=Containers of Power: Eunuchs and Reliquaries in Byzantium|date=2007|volume=51|issue=108-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ludus de Antichristo''''' (Play About the Antichrist) is a liturgical-oriented drama from the 12th century whose original author is unknown.  Its origins are almost certainly from southern [[Germany]], likely a product of the Benedictine monastery in [[Tegernsee]], [[Bavaria]]--as the manuscript that contains the play was kept at the monastery.  Most likely the play was written c. 1160 as much of the thematic material corresponds closely to events occurring during the reign of [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Frederick Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa I]] and his troubles with [[Pope Alexander III]]. A roughly seventy-line fragment of the play is also extant in a thirteenth-century Gospel text from the St. Georgenberg Abbey in modern-day Fiecht, Austria--suggesting a link between the two monastic communities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theatre-survey/article/medieval-space-early-medieval-documents-as-stages/D3FFBEDC8B6DE5F37E1ADB6DF4527D75&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the play is a critique of reform efforts instituted by the Papacy in the twelfth century that would potentially weaken monastic self-rule in favor of a more centralized Papal control over Christian instruction and education, specifically centered on the growth of cathedral schools. The monastery at Tegernsee had enjoyed suzerainty from Papal oversight since the tenth century--answering directly to the Holy Roman Emperor--and sought employ a propaganda effort amongst the many Benedictine communities in Bavaria and Austria in the form of a dramatic interpretation of eschatological events that were supportive of the Emperor as God's instrument in bringing about the final events Christian narrative, rather than those efforts of the Papacy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/30891/Thomas_Kyle.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; The long-standing designation of the play as a "liturgical" (dating back to the nineteenth century) is a result of the inclusion of several well-known liturgies popular amongst Benedictine monastic communities. But these liturgies reflect an "insider's knowledge" of their traditional means of performance, altering the reception of changes made by the author of the play so that the propagandistic messages are codified specifically for the monastic communities that surround Tegernsee. The drama warned its audience of the dangers posed by the [[Antichrist]], a prophesied figure of [[evil]] whose coming (according to the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s) was an indication that the end of the world, or [[apocalypse]], was near.

'''Magister''' is a Dutch online administrative application, used in the [[Education in the Netherlands|schooling system]] in secondary education. All of the students' information is on this platform. Students, parents and teachers are able to access this at all times. It is used to keep up with the management, administration and health issues of students, and users can also view their grades, timetable, homework assignments and absences. In 2012 the software had a 70% market share in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="webwereld.nl"&gt;[http://webwereld.nl/overheid/56466-scholieren-afgesloten-van-gesloten-schoolsoftware webwereld.nl] published on 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Magister was put on the market as a [[SaaS]] (software as a service) by the company Schoolmaster, located in [[Leeuwarden]]. The company has been a part of the Iddink-groep since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schoolmaster.nl/Home/Bedrijf.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access ==
There are different ways to access Magister.

=== Computer ===
To be able to access Magister, installation of [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]] is needed. Since August 2014, this caused people to have issues, using the computer version that used [[Linux]] as an [[operating system]].{{clarification needed|date=June 2018}}{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Mobile phone ===
There is an [[mobile app]] for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (''Meta''). On this app, students can see their grades and timetables, and message their teacher and other students.&lt;ref name="webwereld.nl"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magister 6==

Magister 6, the latest version of the program, was published in August of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magister6.nl Magister 6]&lt;/ref&gt; It is available for students, teachers and parents.

After its launch, several groups tried integrating the technology in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://github.com/DutchCodeGeeks/MagisterHub/blob/master/libs/Magister6.md |title= MagisterHub Libraries |accessdate= 1 May 2016 |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://github.com/DutchCodeGeeks/MagisterHub/blob/master/apps/Magister6.md |title= MagisterHub Apps |accessdate= 1 May 2016 |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was possible, because the new version offers support to [[Representational state transfer|REST]]-[[Application programming interface|api]], which made the process of storing information easier.

Thirteen episodes were produced and aired on [[CBBC]] from 8 April to 1 July 1999. &lt;ref name="airdate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://catalogue.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/MIAMI+7 | title=BBC Programme Catalogue - Miami 7 | accessdate=11 October 2007 | publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During each episode, the members would perform one of the songs from their album ''[[S Club (album)|S Club]]''.

Renamed ''S Club 7 in Miami'', the show was taken to America where it aired on ''Fox Family''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_27/ai_57475939 | title=Daydream Relivers - British import, 'S Club 7' television program, about a performing group by the same name, is coming to the US | accessdate=11 October 2007| date=November 1999 | publisher=Entrepreneur | first=Victoria | last=Neal}}&lt;/ref&gt; - which later became [[ABC Family]] and then [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] - between 6 November 1999 and 5 February 2000. It also aired on [[MusiquePlus]].

The show was watched by 90 million viewers in over 100 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/796258.stm | title=S Club reach for the top | accessdate=11 October 2007 | date=18 June 2000 | publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The show saw the group, desperate to make it big, offered a chance for success in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] by their management. Instead, the gang find themselves working in a hotel for Howard and Marvin Borlotti and entertaining the guests of the hotel. They learn to deal with the [[culture shock]] of being in a new country and eventually enjoy and somewhat become accustomed to what America has to offer.

===Recurring elements===
*The group were always shown to have a strong connection. Every time they put their hands together in a circle and said the words "[[United we stand, divided we fall]]", a bolt of lightning would spread throughout their arms &amp; while it happened, the lightning shocked them.
*The group would always sing one of their songs at the end of every episode. With the exception of episode two where the group sing "[[Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree|Tie a Yellow Ribbon]]" and episode eleven where they sing "[[Dancing Queen]]", which was recorded for the ''[[Abbamania]]'' soundtrack.

They have lunch with Jill Ward (the star of Alien Hunter) and she advises them that they should travel to Los Angeles to make a name for themselves. Howard has a "realization" that maybe he was a little too hard on S Club and tries to "apologize" to them and persuade them to stay. They refuse because they feel like they will be going nowhere as where they first started, although Howard is much closer to them than before, even sharing an emotional goodbye with them. At the end of the episode, they have to decide between moving on to Los Angeles or returning to England to renew their expired management deal or split up as a group when they come across an intersection between the airport and the road to the LA. At the last second, they turn the car towards the long road to LA.

'''Modern Greek art''' is art from the period between the emergence of the new independent [[Greece|Greek]] state and the 20th century.
As Mainland Greece was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule for all four centuries, it missed the [[Renaissance]] and the artistic movements that followed in [[Western Europe]]. However, Greek islands such as [[Crete]], and the [[Ionian islands]] in particular were for large periods under Venetian or other European powers' rule and thus were able to better assimilate the radical artistic changes that were occurring in Europe during the 14th-18th century. The [[Cretan School]] and in particular the [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School]] of art are two typical examples of artistic movements in Greece that followed parallel routes to Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Nano Chatzidakis, in From Byzantium to El Greco, p.49, Athens 1987, Byzantine Museum of Arts&lt;/ref&gt;
As such, there were different artistic trends in the emerging Greek society. Modern Greek art can be said to have been predominantly shaped by the particular socioeconomic conditions of Greece, the large [[Greek diaspora]] across Europe, and the new Greek social elite, as well as external artistic influences, predominantly from Germany and France.

'''The School of Munich'''

Modern Greek art began to be developed around the time of [[Romanticism]]. Greek artists absorbed many elements from their European colleagues, resulting in the culmination of the distinctive style of Greek Romantic art, inspired by revolutionary ideals as well as the country's geography and history. After centuries of Ottoman rule, few opportunities for an education in the arts existed in the newly independent Greece, so studying abroad was imperative for artists. [[Munich]], as an important international center for the arts at that time, was the place where the majority of the Greek artists of the 19th century chose to study. Later on, they would return to Greece and pass on their knowledge. Some of them remained in Munich, the so-called ''Athens on the [[Isar]]''. Both academic and personal bonds developed between early Greek painters and Munich artistry giving birth to the Greek "Munich School" of painting. [[Nikolaos Gysis]] was an important teacher and artist at the [[Munich Academy]] and he soon became a leading figure among Greek artists. Academism, realism, genre painting, upper middle class [[portrait painting|portraiture]], [[still life]] and [[landscape painting]], often representing [[impressionist]] features, will be replaced in the end of the 19th century by [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Jugendstil]], [[Art Nouveau]], which are mainly traced in the work of Nikolaos Gysis, [[Aristeas]] and others.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/exhibitions/munich/munich.en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805064233/http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/exhibitions/munich/munich.en.html |archivedate=2007-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early-20th-century [[modernism]] is also represented by significant Greek artists in Munich. Many of these Munich School artists chose subjects such as everyday Greek life, local customs, and living conditions. Several important painters emerged at this time. [[Theodoros Vryzakis]] specialized in historical painting and especially inspired by the 1821 [[Greek War of Independence]]. [[Nikiphoros Lytras]] concentrated on realistic depictions of Greek life. [[Georgios Jakobides]] devoted his attention to infants and children and he would later become the first Director of the new [[National Gallery of Athens]]. [[Georgios Roilos]] was another leading painter of the period  closely associated with the Munich School, especially in his early career. [[Konstantinos Volanakis]] was inspired mostly by the Greek sea.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/04oct/01181/GreekPainting_20thcentury.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606142423/http://library.thinkquest.org/04oct/01181/GreekPainting_20thcentury.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other artists associated with the [[School of Munich]] were [[Symeon Sabbides]], [[Yannoulis Chalepas]], [[Leonidas Drosis]], as well as quite a few modernist artists who studied in Munich, which included [[Theofrastos Triantafyllidis]], [[Jorgos Busianis]], and also [[Giorgio de Chirico]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Notable sculptors of the new [[Greek Kingdom]] were [[Leonidas Drosis]] (his major work was the extensive neo-classical architectural ornament at the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]]), [[Lazaros Sochos]], [[Georgios Vitalis]], [[Dimitrios Filippotis]], [[Ioannis Kossos]], [[Yannoulis Chalepas]], [[Georgios Bonanos]] and [[Lazaros Fytalis]].

'''The School of Paris'''
[[Image:PericlèsPantazis.Lady knitting.jpg|thumb|160px|left|''Lady knitting'' by [[Périclès Pantazis]].]]

A few Greek painters studied in [[Paris]]. Despite residing in the French capital and following the guidelines of the [[French Art Academy]], they invariably had their own interpretations. [[Jacob Rizos]] was involved with the rendering of female grace, [[Theodoros Rallis]] with scenes from the [[Orthodox East]] and [[Nikolaos Xydias Typaldos]] with portraiture, still life and genre painting. During this period in Paris the avant-garde [[Impressionist]] movement developed, but most Greek painters remained faithful to the precepts of their teachers with only some nebulous thrusts in the direction of this movement. The first Greek impressionist was [[Périclès Pantazis]] who, after Paris, settled in Belgium and became a part of the [[avant-garde]] group ''Circle de la pâte''.

'''Themes-artistic depictions'''

Many Greek artists of this period also drew upon [[El Greco]]'s style for inspiration, particularly when creating art based on religious themes. This tied in with the idea of modern secular Greek art of the period referencing more classical styles, while religious art referenced Byzantine, or Byzantine inspired art. Moreover, an important and often pioneering role was played by artists from [[Ionian islands]] in the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, who exploited conquests of the [[Italian Renaissance]] and [[baroque]] ateliers. As efforts persisted with new directions and objectives, Greek artists emerging in the world during the first decades of the 19th century reconnected Greek art with its ancient tradition, as well as with the quests of the European [[Atelier (art)|ateliers]], especially those of the [[Munich School]], with defining examples of the Greek contemporary art of the period including the works of [[Theodoros Vryzakis]] and [[Nikiphoros Lytras]].

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Macedonian Museums-13-Sygxronhs Texnhs Florinas-62.jpg|thumb|upright|''Glory'' by [[Dimitris Mytaras]].]]

At the beginning of the 20th century landscape painting held sway and the interest of painters turned toward the study of light and color.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The dependence of Munich slackened and Paris became the pole of attraction for the artists of the period. In the early 20th century [[Demetrios Galanis]], a contemporary and friend of [[Picasso]], achieved wide recognition in France and lifelong membership of the [[Académie française]] following his acclaim by the critic [[Andre Malreaux]] as an artist capable "of stirring emotions as powerful as those of [[Giotto]]". Later in the century [[Nikos Engonopoulos]] achieved international recognition with his surrealist conceptions both of painting and poetry, while in the late 1960s [[Dimitris Mytaras]] and [[Yiannis Psychopedis]] became associated with European [[critical realism (philosophy of perception)|critical realism]]. Impressionism was the original influence on the leading figures of the art of the first half of the 20th century, [[Konstantinos Parthenis]] and [[Konstantinos Maleas]], while Nikiphoros Lytras associated himself with the avant-garde groups of Munich constituting the last known link with the series of painters in the great tradition of [[Munich]] in Greek art . The further development of these painters led to other roads, but always within the framework of the avantgarde movement albeit with a Greek dimension. 

Gradually the [[impressionists]] and other modern schools increased their influence. In the early 20th century Greek artists turned from Munich to Paris. The interest of Greek painters, artists changes from historical representations to Greek landscapes with an emphasis on light and colours so abundant in Greece. Representatives of this artistic change are Konstantinos Parthenis, Konstantinos Maleas, Nikiphoros Lytras and [[Georgios Bouzianis]]. [http://www.nationalgallery.gr/html/en/sylloges/20os/parthenis_b.htm Konstantinos Parthenis], in particular, introduces historical, religious and mythological elements that allow the classification of Greek painting into [[modern art]]. The same is true with the landscapes of Konstantinos Maleas and the expressionism of Georgios Bouzianis.  The period of the 1930s was a landmark for the Greek painters, with [[Yiannis Tsarouchis]], [[Yiannis Moralis]], [[Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghikas]], [[Spyros Vassiliou]], [[Alekos Kontopoulos]] (introduced abstraction in Greek paintings) and [[Spyros Papaloukas]] coming into the limelight of Greek Art. These painters tried mainly to link leading European trends with Greek tradition.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern and Contemporary Art in Greece'' (1984), Hans-Jörg Heusser  AICARC Center, Zürich&lt;/ref&gt;

The second half of the 20th century has seen many widely acclaimed Greek artists such as [[Constantine Andreou]], recipient of the French ''Légion d'honneur'', [[Thodoros Papadimitriou]], an internationally acclaimed sculptor. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] was an influential pre-[[Surrealist]] Greek-Italian painter that founded [[Metaphysical art]]. [[Jannis Kounellis]] ranks among the pioneers of the [[Arte Povera]] artistic movement. [[Theodoros Stamos]] was a renowned [[abstract expressionism]] painter.[[Takis]], [[Chrysa]] and [[Constantin Xenakis]] are internationally acclaimed artists of [[Kinetic sculpture]]. Other notable Greek artists are [[Hermon di Giovanno]], [[Varotsos]], [[Dimitris Mytaras]], [[Alekos Fassianos]], [[Theocharis Mores]], [[Dimitris Koukos]] (1948-), [[Nikos Stratakis]], [[Steven Antonakos]], [[Kostas Tsoklis]], [[Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghikas]], [[Thanassis Stephopoulos]], [[Aggelika Korovessi]], and [[Yiannis Melanitis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Horizons: Contemporary Art from Greece'' (1998), Efi Strousa, Roger Wollen, Tullie House Museum, Art Gallery Carlise, England&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mr. Bliss''''' is a children's [[picture book]] by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], published posthumously in book form in 1982. One of Tolkien's least-known short works, it tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car.  Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions.

The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932.  The bears were based on [[Teddy bear|toy bears]] owned by Tolkien's sons.  Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book.  His narrative binds the story and illustrations tightly together, as the text often comments directly on the pictures.

Several commentators have compared ''Mr. Bliss'' with the works of [[Beatrix Potter]] and [[Edward Lear]], and also to ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond, Wayne G.]] &amp; [[Christina Scull]] (2006), ''[[The J. R. R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]'', HarperCollins, Reader's Guide p. 592; {{ISBN|978-0-00-714918-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mr. Bliss'' wasn't published during Tolkien's lifetime. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from Tolkien after the success of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.  The ink and coloured pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive.  Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he didn't have time to do it. The manuscript lay in a drawer until 1957, when he sold it (as well as the original manuscripts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''The Hobbit'', and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'') to [[Marquette University]] for £1,250.

The book was published in 1982, with Tolkien's difficult-to-read handwritten story and illustrations on one page, and a typeset transcription on the facing page.

Tolkien used two names from ''Mr. Bliss'' for hobbits in ''The Lord of the Rings'': [[Gaffer Gamgee]] and [[Boffin (hobbit family)|Boffin]].

{{Mythology}}
'''Myth''' is a [[folklore genre]] consisting of narratives that play a fundamental role in society, such as foundational tales.  The main characters in myths are usually [[gods]], [[demigod]]s or [[supernatural]] humans.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"&gt;"myths", ''A Dictionary of English Folklore''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = oflaherty&gt;{{cite book|last =Doniger O'Flaherty|first = Wendy|quote =I think it can be well argued as a matter of principle that, just as 'biography is about chaps', so mythology is about gods.|page = 19|title = Hindu Myths|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Af7TFlN5hmsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date =1975|publisher = Penguin|isbn = 9780140443066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myths are often endorsed by rulers and priests and are closely linked to [[religion]] or spirituality.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}} In fact, many societies group their myths, legends and history together, considering myths to be true accounts of their remote past.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"/&gt;{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 23}}{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1984|p= 102}} [[Creation myth]]s particularly, take place in a primordial age when the world had not achieved its later form.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}{{sfn|Dundes|1984|p= 1}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 6}} Other myths explain how a society's [[norm (social)|customs]], [[institution]]s and [[taboo]]s were established and sanctified.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 6}} There is a complex relationship between [[myth and ritual|recital of myths and enactment of rituals]].

The study of myth began in [[ancient history]]. Rival classes of the [[Greek myths]] by [[Euhemerus]], [[Plato]] and [[Sallustius]] were developed by the [[Neoplatonists]] and later revived by [[Renaissance]] mythographers. Today, the study of myth continues in a wide variety of academic fields, including [[folklore studies]], [[philology]], and [[psychology]]. The term '''mythology''' may either refer to the study of myths in general, or a body of myths regarding a particular subject. The academic comparisons of bodies of myth is known as [[comparative mythology]].

===''Myth''===
Definitions of ''myth'' to some extent vary by scholar. Finnish [[folklore studies|folklorist]] Lauri Honko offers a widely cited definition:
{{quote|Myth, a story of the gods, a religious account of the [[cosmogony|beginning of the world]], the [[creation myth|creation]], fundamental events, the exemplary deeds of the gods as a result of which the world, nature and culture were created together with all parts thereof and given their order, which still obtains. A myth expresses and confirms society's religious values and norms, it provides a pattern of behavior to be imitated, testifies to the efficacy of [[ritual]] with its practical ends and establishes the sanctity of [[cult]].&lt;REF NAME="HONKO-1984"&gt;{{cite book|last =Honko|first = Lauri|date = 1984 |chapter =The Problem of Defining Myth|editorlink=Alan Dundes|editor-first = Alan|editor-last = Dundes|title =Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth|page = 49|publisher = [[University of California Press]]|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l5Om2ALAFbEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholars in other fields use the term ''myth'' in varied ways.{{sfn|Dundes|1984|p=147}}{{sfn|Doty|2004|pp= 11–12}}{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 5}} In a broad sense, the word can refer to any [[traditional story]],{{sfn|Kirk|1984|p=57}}{{sfn|Kirk|1973|p= 74}}{{sfn|Apollodorus|1976|p= 3}} [[popular misconception]] or [[imagination|imaginary]] entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Merriam-Webster]]'s Collegiate Dictionary|chapter=myth|page=770|edition=10th|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]], Inc|location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while myth and other folklore genres may overlap, myth is often thought to differ from genres such as [[legend]] and [[Folklore genre|folktale]] in that neither are considered to be sacred narratives.&lt;ref name="SALAMON-GOLDBERG-2012"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qhsdhM9tI3EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last1 =Salamon|first1=  Hagar |first2= Harvey E.|last2= Goldberg|date = 2012|chapter =Myth-Ritual-Symbol|editor1-first= Regina F.|editor1-last= Bendix |editor2-first= Galit|editor2-last= Hasan-Rokem |title = A Companion to Folklore|page = 125|publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 7}} Some kinds of folktales, such as [[fairy stories]], are not considered true by anyone, and may be seen as distinct from myths for this reason.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9, 17}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 10–11}}{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1984|pp= 99–101}} Main characters in myths are usually [[gods]], [[demigod]]s or [[supernatural]] humans,{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"&gt;"myths", ''A Dictionary of English Folklore''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oflaherty" /&gt; while legends generally feature humans as their main characters.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}} However, many exceptions or combinations exist, as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Aeneid]]''.{{sfn|Kirk|1973|pp=22, 32}}{{sfn|Kirk|1984|p= 55}} Moreover, as stories spread between cultures or as faiths change, myths can come to be considered folktales, their divine characters recast as either as humans or demihumans such as [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], [[elf|elves]] and [[faerie]]s.&lt;ref name="mythfolk"/&gt;{{sfn|Doty|2004|p=114}}{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 13}} Conversely, historical and literary material may acquire mythological qualities over time. For example, the [[Matter of Britain]] (the legendary history of Great Britain, especially those focused on [[King Arthur]] and [[Round Table|the knights of the Round Table]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/romance-literature-and-performance#toc50951|title=romance {{!}} literature and performance|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Matter of France]], seem distantly to originate in historical events of the fifth and eighth-centuries respectively, and became mythologised over the following centuries.

In colloquial use, the word ''myth'' can also be used of a collectively held belief that has no basis in fact, or any false story.&lt;ref&gt;"myth, n., §2" OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/124670. Accessed 23 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This usage, which is often [[pejorative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howells|first=Richard|title=The Myth of the Titanic|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34BdSTbnSKUC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=myth+pejorative&amp;source=web&amp;ots=X4AT1P_6XR&amp;sig=3UkHYLBt7fQrRDjP4ZOOtQzbBfA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result}}&lt;/ref&gt; arose from labeling the religious myths and beliefs of other cultures as incorrect, but it has spread to cover non-religious beliefs as well.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', 1967, pp. 23, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as commonly used by [[folklore studies|folklorists]] and academics in other relevant fields, such as [[anthropology]], the term ''myth'' has no implication whether the narrative may be understood as true or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Winzeler, Robert L. (2012) ''Anthropology and Religion: What We Know, Think, and Question'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the term ''myth'' is widely used to imply that a story is not [[objective truth|objectively true]], the identification of a narrative as a myth can be highly political: many adherents of religions view their religion's stories as [[truth|true]] and therefore object to the stories being characterised as myths. Nevertheless, scholars now routinely speak of [[Christian mythology]], [[Jewish mythology]], [[Islamic mythology]], [[Hindu mythology]], and so forth. Traditionally, Western scholarship, with its Judaeo-Christian heritage, has viewed narratives in the [[Abrahamic religions]] as being the province of [[theology]] rather than mythology; meanwhile, identifying religious stories of colonised cultures, such as stories in [[Hinduism]], as myths enabled Western scholars to imply that they were of lower truth-value than the stories of [[Christianity]]. Labelling all religious narratives as ''myths'' can be thought of as treating different traditions with parity.&lt;ref name=leeming=preface&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|title=Preface|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQFtlva3HaYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR7|page=vii|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2005|author=David Leeming}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mythology''===
In present use, ''mythology'' usually refers to the collected myths of a group of people, but may also mean the study of such myths.{{sfn|Kirk|1973|p=8}} For example, [[Greek mythology]], [[Roman mythology]] and [[Hittite mythology]] all describe the body of myths retold among those cultures. Folklorist [[Alan Dundes]] defines myth as a [[sacred]] [[narrative]] that explains how the world and humanity evolved into their present form. Dundes classified a sacred narrative as "a story that serves to define the fundamental worldview of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society".&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt; Anthropologist [[Bruce Lincoln]] defines ''myth'' as "ideology in narrative form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lincoln |first= Bruce |year= 2006 |title= An Early Moment in the Discourse of "Terrorism": Reflections on a Tale from Marco Polo |jstor= 3879351 |journal= [[Comparative Studies in Society and History]] |volume= 48 |issue= 2 |pages= 242–259 |quote= More precisely, mythic discourse deals in master categories that have multiple referents: levels of the cosmos, terrestrial geographies, plant and animal species, logical categories, and the like.

===''Mythography''===
The compilation or description of myths is sometimes known as ''mythography'', a term which can also be used of a scholarly anthology of myths (or, confusingly, of the study of myths generally).&lt;ref&gt;"mythography, n." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018, https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124691. Accessed 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Key mythographers in the Classical tradition include [[Ovid]] (43 BCE–17/18 CE), whose tellings of myths have been profoundingly influential; [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius]], a Latin writer of the late fifth to early sixth centuries, whose ''Mythologies'' (Latin: ''Mitologiarum libri III'') gathered and gave moralistic interpretations of a wide range of myths; the anonymous medieval [[Vatican Mythographers]], who developed anthologies of Classical myths that remained influential to the end of the Middle Ages; and the Renaissance scholar [[Natalis Comes]], whose ten-book ''Mythologiae'' became a standard source for classical mythology in later Renaissance Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', 2 vols (Gainesville, 1994–2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent mythographies include the thirteenth-century ''[[Prose Edda]]'' attributed to the Icelander [[Snorri Sturluson]], which is the main surviving survey of [[Norse Mythology]] from the Middle Ages.

===''Mythos''===
Because ''myth'' is sometimes used in a pejorative sense, some scholars have opted to use the term ''mythos'' instead.&lt;ref name=grassie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grassie |first1=William |date=March 1998 |title=Science as Epic?

===''Mythopoeia''===
{{main|Mythopoeia}}
"Conscious generation" of mythology was termed ''mythopoeia'' by, amongst others, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/235084 mythopoeia, n.]" ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018.

==Origins of the terms ''myth'' and ''mythology''==
[[File:Francesco Hayez 028.jpg|thumb|''Odysseus Overcome by Demodocus' Song'', by Francesco Hayez, 1813–15]]
The word ''myth'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] ''μῦθος'' [''mȳthos''], meaning 'speech, narrative, fiction, myth, plot'. In Anglicised form, this Greek word began to be used in English (and was likewise adapted into other European languages) in the early nineteenth century, in a much narrower sense, as a scholarly term for 'a traditional story, typically involving supernatural beings or forces, which embodies and provides an explanation, aetiology, or justification for something such as the early history of a society, a religious belief or ritual, or a natural phenomenon'.&lt;ref name =mythmythos&gt;"[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124670 myth, n.]", "[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124705 mythos, n.]" ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018. Accessed 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|μυθολογία}} [''mythología''] ("story," "lore," "legends," "the telling of stories") combines the word ''mȳthos'' with the suffix -''λογία'' [''-logia''] ("study"), and meant 'romance, fiction, story-telling'.&lt;ref name="oedlogy"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', {{nowrap|1st ed.}} "-logy, ''comb. form''". Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, [[Plato]] used ''mythología'' as a general term for "fiction" or "story-telling" of any kind.

The Greek term ''mythología'' was then borrowed into [[Latin language|Latin]]. [[Late Latin]] ''mythologia'', which occurs in the title of Latin author [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius|Fulgentius]]' fifth-century ''Mythologiæ'', denoted the explication of Greek and Roman stories about their gods, which we now call [[classical mythology]]. Fulgentius's ''Mythologiæ'' explicitly treated its subject matter as [[allegory|allegories]] requiring interpretation and not as true events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Fabius Planciades |last=Fulgentius|title=Fulgentius the Mythographer|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=73mJIuYfmzEC}}|year=1971|publisher=Ohio State University Press|isbn=978-0-8142-0162-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term was then adopted in [[Middle French]] as ''mythologie''. Whether from French or Latin usage, English adopted the word "mythology" in the fifteenth century, at first in the sense 'the exposition of a myth or myths; the interpretation of fables; a book of such expositions'. The word is first attested in [[John Lydgate]]'s ''[[Troy Book]]'' of c. 1425.&lt;ref name=oedmlogy&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd ed.

''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

From Lydgate until the seventeenth or eighteenth-century, ''mythology'' was used to mean a [[moral]], [[fable]], [[allegory]] or a [[parable]], or collection of traditional stories,&lt;ref name="oedmlogy" /&gt;{{refn|All which [''sc.''

It came eventually to be applied to similar bodies of [[traditional stories]] among other [[polytheism|polytheistic]] cultures around the world.&lt;ref name="oedmlogy" /&gt;

Thus the word ''mythology'' entered the English language before the word "myth"; [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]]'s ''[[Johnson's Dictionary|Dictionary]]'', for example, has an entry for ''mythology'', but not for ''myth''. {{refn|[[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]]'s ''[[Johnson's Dictionary|Dictionary]]'', for example, has entries for mythology,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Samuel.

===Meanings in Ancient Greece===
The term μῦθος (''mythos'') appears in the works of [[Homer]] and other poets of Homer's era.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson (2004), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In these works, the term had several meanings: conversation, narrative, speech, story, tale, and word.

Like the related term λόγος (''[[logos]]''), ''mythos'' expresses whatever can be delivered in the form of words; these can be contrasted with  ἔργον (''ergon''), a Greek term for action, deed, and work.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; The term ''mythos'' lacks an explicit distinction between true or false narratives.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

In the context of the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], the term ''mythos'' referred to the myth, the narrative, the plot, and the story of a play.&lt;ref name="Wiles"&gt;Wiles (2000), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Wiles, the Greek term ''mythos'' in this era covered an entire spectrum of different meanings, from undeniable falsehoods to stories with religious and symbolic significance.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt;

According to philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE), the spirit of a theatrical play was its ''mythos''.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; The term ''mythos'' was also used for the source material of [[Greek tragedy]]. The tragedians of the era could draw inspiration from [[Greek mythology]], a body of "traditional storylines" which concerned [[Deity|gods]] and [[hero]]es.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; David Wiles observes that modern conceptions about Greek tragedy can be misleading. It is commonly thought that the ancient audience members were already familiar with the ''mythos'' behind a play, and could predict the outcome of the play. However, the Greek dramatists were not expected to faithfully reproduce traditional myths when [[Theatrical adaptation|adapting them for the stage]]. They were instead recreating the myths and producing new versions.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; Storytellers like [[Euripides]] (c. 480–406 BCE) relied on [[suspense]] to excite their audiences. In one of his works, [[Merope (Messenia)|Merope]] attempts to kill her son's murderer with an axe, unaware that the man in question is actually her son. According to an ancient description of audience reactions to this work, the audience members were genuinely unsure of whether she would commit [[filicide]] or she will be stopped in time. They rose to their feet in terror and caused an uproar.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt;

David Wiles points that the traditional ''mythos'' of Ancient Greece, was primarily a part of its [[oral tradition]]. The [[Greeks]] of this era were a literate culture, but produced no [[Religious text|sacred texts]]. There were no definitive or authoritative versions of myths recorded in texts and preserved forever in an unchanging form.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"&gt;Wiles (2000), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Instead multiple variants of myths were in circulation. These variants were adapted into songs, dances, poetry, and visual art. Performers of myths could freely reshape their source material for a new work, adapting it to the needs of a new audience or in response to a new situation.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"/&gt;

Children in Ancient Greece were familiar with traditional myths from an early age. According to the philosopher [[Plato]] (c. 428–347 BCE), mothers and [[nursemaid]]s narrated myths and stories to the children in their charge: David Wiles describes them as a repository of mythological lore.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"/&gt;

[[Bruce Lincoln]] has called attention to the apparent meaning of the terms ''mythos'' and ''logos'' in the works of [[Hesiod]]. In ''[[Theogony]]'', Hesiod attributes to the [[Muse]]s the ability to both proclaim truths and narrate plausible falsehoods (falsehoods which seem like real things).&lt;ref name="Lincoln"&gt;Lincoln (1999), pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt; The verb used for narrating the falsehoods in the text is ''legein'', which is etymologically associated with ''logos''. There are two variants in the manuscript tradition for the verb used to proclaim truths. One variant uses ''gerusasthai'', the other ''mythesasthai''. The latter is a form of the verb ''mytheomai'' (to speak, to tell), which is etymologically associated with ''mythos''.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; In the ''[[Works and Days]]'', Hesiod describes his dispute with his brother Perses. He also announces to his readers his intention to tell true things to his brother. The verb he uses for telling the truth is ''mythesaimen'', another form of ''mytheomai''.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt;

Lincoln draws the conclusion that Hesiod associated the "speech of ''mythos''" (as Lincoln calls it) with telling the [[truth]]. While he associated the "speech of ''logos''" with telling [[lie]]s, and hiding one's true thoughts (dissimulation).&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; This conclusion is strengthened by the use of the plural term ''logoi'' (the plural form of ''logos'') elsewhere in Hesiod's works. Three times the term is associated with the term "[[seduction|seductive]]" and three times with the term "falsehoods".&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; In his genealogy of the gods, Hesiod lists ''logoi'' among the children of [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess personifying strife. Eris' children are ominous figures, which personify various physical and verbal forms of conflict.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt;

==Interpreting myths==

===Comparative mythology===
{{Main article|Comparative mythology}}
Comparative mythology is the systematic comparison of myths from different cultures. It seeks to discover underlying themes that are common to the myths of multiple cultures. In some cases, comparative mythologists use the similarities between separate mythologies to argue that those mythologies have a common source. This source may inspire myths or provide a common "protomythology" that diverged into the mythologies of each culture.{{sfn|Littleton|1973|p=32}}

===Functionalism===
A number of commentators have argued that myths function to form and shape society and social behaviour. [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] argued that one of the foremost functions of myth is to establish models for behavior{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 8}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 51}} and that myths may provide a religious experience. By telling or reenacting myths, members of traditional societies detach themselves from the present, returning to the mythical age, thereby coming closer to the divine.{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 23}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 51}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 19}}

[[Lauri Honko|Honko]] asserted that, in some cases, a society reenacts a myth in an attempt to reproduce the conditions of the mythical age. For example, it might reenact the healing performed by a god at the beginning of time in order to heal someone in the present.&lt;REF NAME="HONKO-1984"/&gt; Similarly, [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]] argued that modern culture explores religious experience. Since it is not the job of science to define human morality, a religious experience is an attempt to connect with a perceived moral past, which is in contrast with the technological present.{{sfn|Barthes|1972}}

[[Devdutt Pattanaik|Pattanaik]] defines mythology as "a subjective truth of people that is communicated through stories, symbols and rituals". He adds, "unlike fantasy that is nobody’s truth, and history that seeks to be everybody’s truth, mythology is somebody’s truth."&lt;ref name="PD2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/culture/why-i-insist-on-calling-myself-a-mythologist|title=Why I Insist On Calling Myself A Mythologist|last=Pattanaik|first=Devdutt|date=14 September 2015|website=Swarajya|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euhemerism===
{{Main article|Euhemerism}}
{{See also|Herodotus}}
One theory claims that myths are distorted accounts of historical events.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} According to this theory, storytellers repeatedly elaborate upon historical accounts until the figures in those accounts gain the status of gods.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} For example, the myth of the wind-god [[Aeolus]] may have evolved from a historical account of a king who taught his people to use sails and interpret the winds.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}} [[Herodotus]] (fifth-century BCE) and [[Prodicus]] made claims of this kind.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} This theory is named ''[[euhemerism]]'' after mythologist [[Euhemerus]] (c. 320 BCE), who suggested that Greek gods developed from legends about human beings.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}}&lt;ref&gt;"Euhemerism", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegory===
Some theories propose that myths began as allegories for natural phenomena: [[Apollo]] represents the sun, [[Poseidon]] represents water, and so on.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} According to another theory, myths began as allegories for philosophical or spiritual concepts: [[Athena]] represents wise judgment, [[Aphrodite]] desire, and so on.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} [[Max Müller|Müller]] supported an allegorical theory of myth. He believed myths began as allegorical descriptions of nature and gradually came to be interpreted literally. For example, a poetic description of the sea as "raging" was eventually taken literally and the sea was then thought of as a raging god.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 20}}

===Personification===
{{See also|Mythopoeic thought}}
Some thinkers claimed that myths result from the [[Anthropomorphism|personification]] of objects and forces. According to these thinkers, the ancients worshiped natural phenomena, such as fire and air, gradually deifying them.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 195}} For example, according to this theory, ancients tended to view things as gods, not as mere objects.{{sfn|Frankfort|Frankfort|Wilson|Jacobsen|2013|p= 4}} Thus, they described natural events as acts of personal gods, giving rise to myths.{{sfn|Frankfort|Frankfort|Wilson|Jacobsen|2013|p= 15}}

===Myth-ritual theory===
{{See also|Myth and ritual}}
According to the myth-ritual theory, myth is tied to ritual.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 61}} In its most extreme form, this theory claims myths arose to explain rituals.{{sfn|Graf|1996|p= 40}} This claim was first put forward by [[William Robertson Smith|Smith]],{{sfn|Meletinsky|2014| pp=19–20}} who argued that people begin performing rituals for reasons not related to myth. Forgetting the original reason for a ritual, they account for it by inventing a myth and claiming the ritual commemorates the events described in that myth.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 63}} [[James Frazer|Frazer]] claimed that humans started out with a belief in magical rituals; later, they began to lose faith in magic and invented myths about gods, reinterpreting their rituals as religious rituals intended to appease the gods.{{sfn|Frazer|1913|p= 711}}

==History of the academic discipline==
Historically, important approaches to the study of mythology have included those of [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Schiller]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], [[Freud]], [[Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Lévi-Strauss]], [[Northrop Frye|Frye]], the Soviet school, and the [[Myth and Ritual School]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Lanoue, Foreword to Meletinsky, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Myths and legends of Babylonia and Assyria (1916) (14801987593).jpg|thumb|right|''Myths and legends of [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]]'' (1916)]]
The critical interpretation of myth began with the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Presocratics]].{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 1}} Euhemerus was one of the most important pre-modern mythologists. He interpreted myths as accounts of actual historical events – distorted over many retellings. Sallustius&lt;ref&gt;On the Gods and the World, ch. 5, See Collected Writings on the Gods and the World, The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; divided myths into five categories – theological, physical (or concerning natural laws), animistic (or concerning soul), material, and mixed. Mixed concerns myths that show the interaction between two or more of the previous categories and are particularly used in initiations.

Plato famously condemned poetic myth when discussing education in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]].'' His critique was primarily on the grounds that the uneducated might take the stories of gods and heroes literally. Nevertheless, he constantly referred to myths throughout his writings. As [[Platonism]] developed in the phases commonly called [[Middle Platonism]] and [[neoplatonism]], writers such as [[Plutarch]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Proclus]], [[Olympiodorus the younger|Olympiodorus,]] and [[Damascius]] wrote explicitly about the symbolic interpretation of traditional and Orphic myths.&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the most extended passage of philosophic interpretation of myth is to be found in the fifth and sixth essays of Proclus’ ''Commentary on the Republic'' (to be found in ''The Works of Plato I'', trans. Thomas Taylor, The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1996); Porphyry’s analysis of the Homeric Cave of the Nymphs is another important work in this area (''Select Works of Porphyry'', Thomas Taylor The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1994). See the external links below for a full English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mythological themes were consciously employed in literature, beginning with [[Homer]]. The resulting work may expressly refer to a mythological background without itself becoming part of a body of myths ([[Cupid and Psyche]]). Medieval romance in particular plays with this process of turning myth into literature. ''Euhemerism'', as stated earlier, refers to the rationalization of myths, putting themes formerly imbued with mythological qualities into pragmatic contexts. An example of this would be following a cultural or religious paradigm shift (notably the re-interpretation of [[Paganism|pagan]] mythology following [[Christianization]]).

[[File:Bartolomeo di Giovanni - The Myth of Io - Walters 37421.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=The ancient Roman poet Ovid, in his "The Metamorphoses," told the story of the nymph Io who was seduced by Jupiter, the king of the gods. When his wife Juno became jealous, Jupiter transformed Io into a heifer to protect her. This panel relates the second half of the story. In the upper left, Jupiter emerges from clouds to order Mercury to rescue Io. In the lower left, Mercury guides his herd to the spot where Io is guarded by the hundred-eyed Argus. In the upper center, Mercury, disguised as a shepherd, lulls Argus to sleep and beheads him. Juno then takes Argus's eyes to ornament the tail feathers of her peacock and sends the Furies to pursue Io, who flees to the Nile River. At last, Jupiter prevails on his wife to cease tormenting the nymph, who, upon resuming her natural form, escapes to the forest and ultimately becomes the Egyptian goddess Isis|This panel by [[Bartolomeo di Giovanni]] relates the second half of the [[Metamorphoses]].

Interest in polytheistic mythology revived during the [[Renaissance]], with early works of mythography appearing in the sixteenth century, among them the ''[[Theologia mythologica|Theologia Mythologica]]'' (1532).

===Nineteenth century===
The first modern, Western scholarly theories of myth appeared during the second half of the nineteenth century{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 1}} — at the same time as the word ''myth'' was adopted as a scholarly term in European languages.&lt;ref name="mythmythos" /&gt; They were driven partly by a new interest in Europe's ancient past and [[vernacular]] culture, associated with [[Romantic Nationalism]] and epitomised by the research of [[Jacob Grimm]] (1785–1863). This movement drew European scholars' attention not only to Classical myths, but also material now associated with [[Norse mythology]], [[Finnish mythology]], and so forth. Western theories were also partly driven by Europeans' efforts to comprehend and control the cultures, stories and religions they were encountering through [[colonialism]]. These encounters included both extremely old texts such as the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''[[Rigveda]]'' and the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', and current oral narratives such as [[mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]] or stories told in [[traditional African religions]].&lt;ref name = shippey&gt;Tom Shippey, 'A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century', in ''The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm’s Mythology of the Monstrous'', ed. by Tom Shippey, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 291/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 14 (Tempe, AZ: Arizon Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 1–28 (esp. pp. 4–13).&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual context for nineteenth-century scholars was profoundly shaped by emerging ideas about [[evolution]]. These ideas included the recognition that many Eurasian languages—and therefore, conceivably, stories—were all descended from a lost common ancestor (the [[Indo-European language]]) which could rationally be reconstructed through the comparison of its descendant languages. They also included the idea that [[Cultural evolution|cultures might evolve]] in ways comparable to species.&lt;ref name = shippey/&gt; In general, nineteenth-century theories framed myth as a failed or obsolete mode of thought, often by interpreting myth as the primitive counterpart of modern science within a [[Unilineal evolution|unilineal]] framework that imagined that human cultures are travelling, at different speeds, along a linear path of cultural development.{{sfn|Segal|2015|pp= 3–4}}

One of the dominant mythological theories of the later nineteenth century was "nature mythology", whose foremost exponents included [[Max Müller]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]. This theory posited that "primitive man" was primarily concerned with the natural world. It tended to interpret myths that seemed distasteful European Victorians—for example tales about sex, incest, or cannibalism—as being metaphors for natural phenomena like agricultural fertility.&lt;ref&gt;John McKinnell, ''Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 2005), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to conceive impersonal natural laws, early humans tried to explain natural phenomena by attributing souls to inanimate objects, giving rise to [[animism]]. According to Tylor, human thought evolved through stages, starting with mythological ideas and gradually progressing to scientific ideas.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 4}} Müller also saw myth arising from language, even calling myth a "disease of language". He speculated that myths arose due to the lack of abstract nouns and neuter gender in ancient languages. Anthropomorphic figures of speech, necessary in such languages, were eventually taken literally, leading to the idea that natural phenomena were in actuality conscious beings or gods.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 20}} Not all scholars, not even all nineteenth-century scholars, accepted this view. [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] claimed "the primitive mentality is a condition of the human mind, and not a stage in its historical development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mâche|title=Music, Myth and Nature, or The Dolphins of Arion| year=1992| page= 8 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YNCVOY423HsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first = Francois-Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship, noting the fundamental lack of evidence for "nature mythology" interpretations among people who actually circulated myths, has likewise abandoned the key ideas of "nature mythology".&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Dorson, 'The Eclipse of Solar Mythology', in ''Myth: A Symposium'', ed. by Thomas A. Sebeok (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1955), 25–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John McKinnell, ''Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 2005), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James George Frazer]] saw myths as a misinterpretation of magical rituals, which were themselves based on a mistaken idea of natural law: this idea was central to the "[[myth and ritual]]" school of thought.{{sfn|Segal|2015|pp= 67–68}} According to Frazer, humans begin with an unfounded belief in impersonal magical laws. When they realize applications of these laws do not work, they give up their belief in natural law in favor of a belief in personal gods controlling nature, thus giving rise to religious myths. Meanwhile, humans continue practicing formerly magical rituals through force of habit, reinterpreting them as reenactments of mythical events. Finally humans come to realize nature follows natural laws, and they discover their true nature through science. Here again, science makes myth obsolete as humans progress "from magic through religion to science."{{sfn|Frazer|1913|p= 711}}

Segal asserted that by pitting mythical thought against modern scientific thought, such theories imply modern humans must abandon myth.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 3}}

===Twentieth century===
[[File:Prometheus by Gustave Moreau.jpg|thumb|''[[Prometheus]]'' (1868) by [[Gustave Moreau]]. In the mythos of [[Hesiodus]] and possibly [[Aeschylus]] (the [[Greek mythos|Greek]] trilogy ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' and ''[[Prometheus Pyrphoros]]''), Prometheus is bound and tortured for giving fire to humanity]]

The earlier twentieth century saw major work developing [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] approaches to interpreting myth, led by [[Sigmund Freud]], who, drawing inspiration from Classical myth, began developing the concept of the [[Oedipus complex]] in his 1899 ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''. [[Carl Jung|Jung]] likwise tried to understand the psychology behind world myths. Jung asserted that all humans share certain innate unconscious psychological forces, which he called ''[[archetypes]]''. He believed similarities between the myths of different cultures reveals the existence of these universal archetypes.&lt;ref&gt;Boeree.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-twentieth century saw the influential development of a [[structuralist theory of mythology]], led by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]. Strauss argued that myths reflect patterns in the mind and interpreted those patterns more as fixed mental structures, specifically pairs of opposites (good/evil, compassionate/callous), rather than unconscious feelings or urges.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 113}} Meanwhile, [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] developed analyses of myths focusing on their social functions in the real world. He is associated with the idea that myths such as [[Origin myth|origin stories]] might provide a "mythic charter"—a legitimisation—for cultural norms and social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Birenbaum, ''Myth and Mind'' (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1988), pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, following the Structuralist Era (roughly the 1960s to 1980s), the predominant anthropological and sociological approaches to myth increasingly treated myth as a form of narrative that can be studied, interpreted and analyzed like ideology, history and culture. In other words, myth is a form of understanding and telling stories that is connected to power, political structures, and political and economic interests. These approaches contrast with approaches such as those of Campbell and Eliade that hold that myth has some type of essential connection to ultimate sacred meanings that transcend cultural specifics. In particular, myth was studied in relation to history from diverse social sciences. Most of these studies share the assumption that history and myth are not distinct in the sense that history is factual, real, accurate, and truth, while myth is the opposite.

In the 1950s, Barthes published a series of essays examining modern myths and the process of their creation in his book ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', which stood as an early work in the emerging [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] approach to mythology, which recognised myths' existence in the modern world and in [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wsGDVdYoRA4C&amp;dq=Barthes+Mythologies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKp_nv8q_cAhWlF5oKHSWQB6oQ6AEIJDAA|title = Mythologies|date = 1972|publisher = Hill and Wang|last = Barthes|first = Roland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twentieth century saw rapid [[secularisation]] in Western culture. This made Western scholars more willing to analyse narratives in the [[Abrahamic religions]] as myths; theologians such as [[Rudolf Bultmann]] argued that a modern Christianity needed to [[Demythologization|demythologize]];&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Bultmann, ''Jesus Christ and Mythology'' (New York: Scribner, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; and other religious scholars embraced the idea that the mythical status of Abrahamic narratives was a legitimate feature of their importance.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 3}} This, in his appendix to ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', and in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] attributed modern humans’ anxieties to their rejection of myths and the sense of the sacred.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Christian theologian [[Conrad Hyers]] wrote that
{{quote|...myth today has come to have negative connotations which are the complete opposite of its meaning in a religious context... In a religious context, however, myths are storied vehicles of supreme truth, the most basic and important truths of all. By them people regulate and interpret their lives and find worth and purpose in their existence. Myths put one in touch with sacred realities, the fundamental sources of being, power, and truth. They are seen not only as being the opposite of error but also as being clearly distinguishable from stories told for entertainment and from the workaday, domestic, practical language of a people. They provide answers to the mysteries of being and becoming, mysteries which, as mysteries, are hidden, yet mysteries which are revealed through story and ritual. Myths deal not only with truth but with ultimate truth.{{sfn|Hyers|1984|p=107}}}}

===Twenty-first century===
Both in nineteenth-century research that tended to see existing records of stories and folklore as imperfect fragments of partially lost myths, and in twentieth-century structuralist work that sought to identify underlying patterns and structures in often diverse versions of a given myth, there had been a tendency to synthesise sources to attempt to reconstruct what scholars supposed to be more perfect or underlying forms of myths. From the late twentieth century, however, researchers influenced by [[postmodernism]] tended instead to argue that each account of a given myth has its own cultural significance and meaning, and argued that rather than representing degradation from a once more perfect form, myths are inherently plastic and variable.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. John McKinnell, ''Both One and Many: Essays on Change and Variety in Late Norse Heathenism'', Philologia: saggi, ricerche, edizioni a cura bi Teresa Pàroli, 1 (Rome, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; There is, consequently, no such thing as the 'original version' or 'original form' of a myth. One prominent example of this movement was [[A.K. Ramanujan]]'s essay ''[[Three Hundred Ramayanas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Ramanujan, ‘Three Hundred Rāmāyaṇas: Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation’, in ''[http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft3j49n8h7/ Many Rāmāyaṇas: The Diversity of a Narrative Tradition in South Asia]'', ed. by Paula Richman (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), pp. 22–48; [http://www.trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/three-hundred-Ramayanas-A-K-Ramanujan.pdf reprinted] in A.K. Ramanujan, ''The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 131–60, {{ISBN|9780195668964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondingly, scholars challenged the precedence that had once been given to texts as a medium for mythology, arguing that other media, such as the visual arts or even landscape and place-naming, could be as or more important.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ken Dowden, ''The Uses of Greek Mythology'' (London: Routledge, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern mythology==
[[File:10,000 Belgian francs of 1929 edited.jpg|thumb|left|1929 [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[banknote]], depicting [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[caduceus]]]]
In modern society, myth is often regarded as a collection of stories. Scholars in the field of [[cultural studies]] research how myth has worked itself into modern discourses. Mythological discourse can reach greater audiences than ever before via digital media. Various mythic elements appear in [[television]], [[Film|cinema]] and [[video game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/nctefiles/resources/journals/ej/1026-jul2013/ej1026exploring.pdf|title=Exploring the Boundaries of Narrative: Video Games in the English Classroom|last=Ostenson|first=Jonathan|date=2013|website=www2.ncte.org/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although myth was traditionally transmitted through the oral tradition on a small scale, the film industry has enabled filmmakers to transmit myths to large audiences via film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cinematic Mythmaking: Philosophy in Film|last=Singer|first=Irving|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] psychology myths are the expression of a culture or society’s goals, fears, ambitions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Indick|first=William|date=November 18, 2004|title=Classical Heroes in Modern Movies: Mythological Patterns of the Superhero|url=|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of modern visual storytelling is rooted in the mythological tradition. Many contemporary films rely on ancient myths to construct narratives. [[The Walt Disney Company]] is well-known among cultural study scholars for "reinventing" traditional childhood myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Folklore Studies and Popular Film and Television: A Necessary Critical Survey|last=Koven|first=Michael|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=176–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many films are not as obvious as Disney fairy tales, the plots of many films are based on the rough structure of myths. Mythological archetypes, such as the cautionary tale regarding the abuse of technology, battles between gods and creation stories, are often the subject of major film productions. These films are often created under the guise of [[cyberpunk]] [[action film]]s, [[fantasy]], [[drama]]s and [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] tales.{{sfn|Corner|1999|pp=47–59}}

21st-century films such as ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', ''[[Immortals (2011 film)|Immortals]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' continue the trend of mining traditional mythology to frame modern plots. Authors use mythology as a basis for their books, such as [[Rick Riordan]], whose [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians|Percy Jackson and the Olympians]] series is situated in a modern-day world where the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek deities]] are manifest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/percy-jackson-problem|title=The Percy Jackson Problem|last=Mead|first=Rebecca|date=2014-10-22|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-11-06|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oriental carpet|Carpets]] of [[Middle-Eastern]] origin, either from [[Turkish carpet|Anatolia]], [[Persian carpet|Persia]], [[Armenian carpet|Armenia]], [[Azerbaijani rug|Azerbaijan]], the [[Levant]], the [[Mamluk]] state of [[Egypt]] or [[Northern Africa]], were used as decorative features in Western European [[paintings]] from the 14th century onwards. More depictions of '''Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting''' survive than actual carpets produced before the 17th century, though the number of these known has increased in recent decades. Therefore, comparative art-historical research has from its onset in the late 19th century relied on carpets represented in datable European paintings.

== Art historical background ==
[[File:Petrus Christus Virgin and Child Detail.jpg|thumb|[[Petrus Christus]], Virgin and Child with Saints Jerome and Francis (detail), 1457, with a [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] depiction of a pile-woven carpet. [[Städel]] Museum, Frankfurt]]

Activities of scientists and collectors beginning in the late 19th century have substantially increased the corpus of surviving Oriental carpets, allowing for more detailed comparison of existing carpets with their painted counterparts. Western comparative research resulted in an ever more detailed cultural history of the Oriental art of carpet weaving. This has in turn renewed and inspired the scientific interest in their countries of origin. Comparative research based on Renaissance paintings and carpets preserved in museums and collections continues to contribute to the expanding body of art historical and cultural knowledge.

The tradition of precise realism among Western painters of the late 15th and 16th century provides pictorial material which is often detailed enough to justify conclusions about even minute details of the painted carpet. The carpets are treated with exceptional care in the rendering of colors, patterns, and details of form and design: The painted texture of a carpet depicted in [[Petrus Christus]]'s "Virgin and Child", the drawing of the individual patterns and motifs, and the way the pile opens where the carpet is folded over the steps, all suggest that the depicted textile is a pile-woven carpet.

Visually, the carpets serve to draw attention either to an important person, or to highlight a location where significant action is going on. In parallel with the development of Renaissance painting, initially mainly Christian saints and religious scenes are set out on the carpets. Later on, the carpets were integrated into secular contexts, but always served to represent the idea of opulence, exoticism, luxury, wealth, or status. First, their use was reserved for the most powerful and most wealthy, for royalty and nobility. Later on, as more people gained sufficient wealth to afford goods of luxury, Oriental carpets appeared on the portraits of merchants and wealthy burghers. During the late 17th and 18th century, the interest in depicting carpets declined. In parallel, the paintings pay less attention to detail.

The richly designed Oriental carpets appealed strongly to Western painters. The rich and various colours may have influenced the great Venetian painters of the [[Quattrocento]].&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erdmann, Kurt|year=1970|title=Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press (translated from the German ''Siebenhundert Jahre Orientteppich'' by May H. Beattie and Hildegard Herzog)|isbn=9780520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the pictorial representation of carpets is linked to the development of the [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bier|first1=Carol|title=From grid to projected grid: Oriental carpets and the development of linear perspective.|journal=Proceedings of the Textile Society of America - 12th Biennal Symposium|date=2010|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=tsaconf|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first described by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in 1435.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberti|first1=Leon Battista|editor1-last=Sinisgalli|editor1-first=Rocco|title=On painting : a new translation and critical edition|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107000629|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of oriental carpets in Renaissance paintings is regarded as an important contribution to a "world history of art", based upon interactions of different cultural traditions.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrier|first1=David|title=A world art history and its objects|date=2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=978-0271034157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rugs from the Islamic world arrived in large numbers in Western Europe by the 15th century, which is increasingly recognized as a pivotal temporal nexus in the cultural encounters that contributed to the development of Renaissance ideas, arts, and sciences. Intensified contacts, especially the increasing trade between the Islamic world and Western Europe, have provided material sources and cultural [[Islamic influences on Christian art|influences]] to Western artists during the next centuries to come. In turn, European market demands also affected the carpet production in their countries of origin.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt;

== Origin and limitations of the comparative approach ==

In 1871, [[Julius Lessing]] published his book on oriental carpet design. He was relying more on European paintings than on the examination of actual carpets for lack of material, because ancient oriental carpets were not yet collected at the time when he worked on his book.&lt;ref name="Lessing, Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Julius|title=Altorientalische Teppichmuster: Nach Bildern und Originalen des XV. - XVI. Jahrhunderts, translated into English as ''Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns after Pictures and Originals of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries''. London: H. Sotheran &amp; Co., 1879|date=1877|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessing's approach has proven very useful to establish a scientific chronology of Oriental carpet weaving, and was further elaborated and expanded mainly by scholars of the "Berlin school" of History of [[Islamic art]]: [[Wilhelm von Bode]], and his successors [[Friedrich Sarre]], [[Ernst Kühnel]], and [[Kurt Erdmann]] developed the ''"[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]"'' method for the dating of oriental carpets based on Renaissance paintings.

These art historians were also aware of the fact that their scientific approach was biased: Only carpets produced by manufactories were exported to Western Europe, and consequently were available to the Renaissance artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erdmann |first1=Kurt |title=Pinner, R.: Editorial to "The history of the early Turkish carpet." by K. Erdmann |date=1977 |publisher=Oguz Pr. |location=London |isbn=9780905820026 |edition=1977 English ed. of the original, 1957 German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Village or nomadic rugs did not reach Europe during the Renaissance, and were not depicted in paintings. Not until the mid twentieth century, when collectors like Joseph V. McMullan or [[James F. Ballard]] recognized the artistic and art historic value of village or nomadic carpets, were they appreciated in the Western World.

Pile carpets with geometric design are known to have been produced from the 13th century among the [[Seljuks of Rum]] in eastern [[Anatolia]], whom [[Venice]] had had commercial relations since 1220.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.74"&gt;Mack, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; The Medieval trader and traveler [[Marco Polo]] himself mentioned that the carpets produced at [[Konya]] were the best in the world:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''...et ibi fiunt soriani et tapeti pulchriores de mundo et pulchrioris coloris.''&lt;br&gt;
"...and here they make the most beautiful silks and carpets in the world, and with the most beautiful colours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsden|first1=William|editor1-last=Wright|editor1-first=Thomas|title=Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian: the translation of Marsden revised.|date=2010|publisher=Bibliobazaar, Llc|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1142126261|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Carpets were also produced in [[Al Andaluz|Islamic Spain]], and one is shown in a fresco of the 1340s in the [[Palais des Papes]], [[Avignon]].&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of carpets in 15th- and 16th-century paintings are either from the [[Ottoman Empire]], or possibly European copies of these types from the [[Balkans]], Spain, or elsewhere.  In fact these were not the finest Islamic carpets of the period, and few of the top-quality Turkish "court" carpets are seen.  Even finer than these, [[Persian carpet]]s do not appear until the end of the 16th century, but become increasingly popular among the very wealthy in the 17th century.  The very refined [[Mamluk]] carpets from [[Egypt]] are occasionally seen, mostly in [[Venice|Venetian]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first uses of an oriental carpet in a European painting is [[Simone Martini]]'s ''Saint Louis of Toulouse Crowning Robert of Anjou, King of Naples'', painted in 1316-1319.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.74-75. [[:File:1s louis21.jpg|Image]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another Anatolian animal carpet appears in a c. 1340-45 Sienese panel of the Holy Family attributed to Pietro or Ambrogio Lorenzetti (Abegg-Stiftung, Riggisberg) with alternating black and white animals within colorful octagonal medallions.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, S. Maureen, 'Mary with Her Spools of Thread: Domesticating the Sacred Interior in Tuscan Trecento Art,' in John Garton and Diane Wolfthal, eds., ''New Studies on Old Masters: Essays in Renaissance Art in Honour of Colin Eisler'', Toronto: Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies, 2011, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; European depictions of Oriental carpets were extremely faithful to the originals, judging by comparison with the few surviving examples of actual rugs of contemporary date.  Their larger scale also allows more detailed and accurate depictions than those shown in miniature paintings from Turkey or Persia.

Most carpets use [[Islamic art|Islamic]] geometric designs, with the earliest ones also using animal patterns such as the originally Chinese-inspired "phoenix-and-dragon", as in [[Domenico di Bartolo]]'s ''[[:File:Domenico di Bartolo The Marriage of the Foundlings 1440.jpg|Marriage of the Foundlings]]'' (1440).  These had been stylised and simplified into near-geometric motifs in their transmission to the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.75. King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 13, and 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole group, referred to in the literature as "[[Early Anatolian Animal carpets|Animal rugs]]" disappeared from paintings by about the end of the 15th century.  Only a handful of original animal-pattern carpets survive, two from European churches, where their rarity presumably preserved them.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Marby Rug", one of the finest examples, was preserved in a church of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] town of Marby, and a bold adaptation of an originally Chinese "dragon and phoenix" motif is in Berlin. Both are rugs, less than 2 metres long, and about 1 metre wide, with two compartments, though the Berlin carpet lacks a border down one long side.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 49-50&lt;/ref&gt; The "Dragon and Phoenix" and the "Marby" rugs were the only existing examples of Animal carpets known until 1988. Since then, seven more carpets of this type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]]. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;ref name="MET animal carpet Acc.Nr. 1990.61"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/453317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which parallels a painting by the Sienese artist [[Gregorio di Cecco]]: "The Marriage of the Virgin", 1423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Gallery London|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/probably-by-gregorio-di-cecco-di-luca-the-marriage-of-the-virgin|website=National Gallery London NG 1317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows large [[confronted animals]], each with a smaller animal inside.

Although the carpets were displayed on a public floor in a few examples, most carpets on the floor are in an area reserved for the main protagonists, very often on a dais or in front of an altar, or down steps in front of the [[Virgin Mary]] or [[Saints]], or rulers,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; in the manner of a modern [[red carpet]].  This presumably reflected the contemporary practice of royalty; in [[Denmark]] the 16th century Persian [[Coronation Carpet]] is used under the throne for coronations to this day.  They are also often hung over [[balustrade]]s or out of windows for festive occasions, such as the processions through Venice shown by [[Vittore Carpaccio]] or [[Gentile Bellini]] (see gallery);&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; when Carpaccio's [[St Ursula]] embarks they are hung over the sides of boats and footbridges.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Vittore Carpaccio 045.jpg|Carpaccio image]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oriental carpets were often depicted as a decorative element in religious scenes, and were a symbol of luxury, status and taste,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.73-93&lt;/ref&gt; although they were becoming more widely available throughout the period, which is reflected in the paintings. In some cases, such as paintings by Gentile Bellini, the carpets reflect an early [[orientalism|Orientalist]] interest, but for most painters they merely reflect the prestige of the carpets in Europe.  A typical example is the Turkish carpet at the feet of the Virgin Mary in the 1456-1459 [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]] by [[Andrea Mantegna]] ([[:File:Andrea Mantegna 028.jpg|see detail]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-royal portrait sitters were more likely to place their carpet on a table or other piece of furniture, especially in Northern Europe, though small rugs beside a bed are not uncommon, as in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' of 1434.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Carpets are seen on tables in particular in Italian scenes showing the ''Calling of [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]]'', when he was engaged in his work as a tax-collector,&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 14&lt;/ref&gt; and the life of [[Saint Eligius]], who was a [[goldsmith]].  Both are shown sitting doing business at a carpet-covered table or shop counter.
 
The Oriental carpets used in Renaissance painting had various geographical origins, designated in contemporary Italy by different names: the ''cagiarini'' (Mamluk design from Egypt), the ''damaschini'' ([[Damascus]] region), the ''barbareschi'' (North Africa), the ''rhodioti'' (probably imported through Rome), the ''turcheschi'' ([[Ottoman Empire]]) and the ''simiscasa'' ([[Circassians|Circassian]] or [[Caucasus|Caucasian]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the prayer carpets represented in Christian religious paintings are also Islamic [[prayer mats]], with such motifs as the [[mihrab]] or the [[Kaaba]] (the so-called re-entrant carpets, later called the "Bellini" type).&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.84. King &amp; Sylvester, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The representation of such prayer rugs disappeared after 1555, probably as a consequence of the realization of their religious meaning and connection to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of Oriental carpets in paintings other than portraits generally declined after the 1540s, corresponding to a decline in the taste for highly detailed representation of objects (Detailism) among painters,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.90&lt;/ref&gt; and grander classicising surrounds for hieratic religious images.

When Western scholars explored the history of Islamic carpetmaking, several types of carpet pattern became conventionally called after the names of European painters who had used them, and these terms remain in use.  The classification is mostly that of [[Kurt Erdmann]], once Director of the [[Museum für Islamische Kunst (Berlin)]], and the leading carpet scholar of his day.  Some of these types ceased to be produced several centuries ago, and the location of their production remains uncertain, so obvious alternative terms were not available.  The classification ignores the border patterns, and distinguishes between the type, size and arrangement of [[gul (design)|gul]], or larger motifs in the central field of the carpet.  In addition to four types of Holbein carpets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period3.html Old Turkish carpets] website&lt;/ref&gt; there are Bellini carpets, Crivellis, Memlings, and [[Lotto carpet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester&lt;/ref&gt;  These names are somewhat random: many artists painted these types, and single artists often painted many types of carpets.

===Bellini carpets===
Both [[Giovanni Bellini]] and his brother [[Gentile Bellini|Gentile]] (who visited [[Istanbul]] in 1479) painted examples of these prayer-rugs with a single "re-entrant" or keyhole motif at the bottom of a larger figure traced in a thin border.  At the top end the borders close diagonally to a point, from which hangs down a "lamp".  The design had Islamic significance, and its function seems to have been recognised in Europe, as they were known in English as "musket" carpets, a corruption of "mosque".&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, pp. 14-16, 56, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Gentile Bellini seen at top the rug is the "right" way round; often this is not the case.  Later Ushak prayer-rugs where both ends have the diagonal pointed inner border, as at the top only of Bellini rugs, are sometimes known as [[Tintoretto]] rugs, though this term is not as commonly used as the others mentioned here.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crivelli carpets===
[[Carlo Crivelli]] twice painted what seems to be the same small rug, with the centre taken up with a complex sixteen-pointed star motif made up of several compartments in different colours, some containing highly stylised animal motifs. Comparable actual carpets are extremely rare, but there are two in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;One shown [http://www.turkotek.com/misc_00021/hash_gul.htm here], about a third of the way down the page.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Annunciation'' of 1482 in the [[Städel]] museum in Frankfurt shows it at the top, and the same carpet seems to be used in the ''Annunciation, with Saint Emidius'' in the [[National Gallery, London]] (1486), which shows the type hung over a balcony to the top left, and a different type of carpet over another balcony in the right foreground.  These seem to be a transitional type between the early animal-pattern carpets and later purely geometrical designs, such as the Holbein types, perhaps reflecting increased [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] enforcement of Islamic [[aniconism]].&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 14, 26, 57-58. Campbell, p. 189.[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/zoomImage?workNumber=NG739&amp;collectionPublisherSection=work National Gallery zoomable image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507124425/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/zoomImage?workNumber=NG739&amp;collectionPublisherSection=work |date=2009-05-07 }}. There is a different type of carpet hung from the Virgin's house, at top center-right.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memling carpets===
{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = Left image: yellow Oriental carpet in [[Hans Memling]] altarpiece of 1488-1490. The "hooked" motif defines a "Memling carpet".&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louvre Museum]].&lt;br&gt; Right image: [[Konya]] 18th century carpet with Memling gul design.| footer_align = left | image1 =Hans Memling La Vierge et l Enfant entre Saint Jacques et Saint Dominique 1488 1490.jpg| width1 = 265 | caption1  = | image2 =Konya 18th carpet with Memling gul design.jpg| width2 = 112 | caption2 = }} 
These are named after [[Hans Memling]], who painted several examples of what may have been [[Armenian carpet]]s in the last quarter of the fifteenth century, and are characterised by several lines coming off the motifs that end in "hooks", by coiling in on themselves through two or three 90° turns.  Another example appears in a miniature painted for [[René of Anjou]] about 1460.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Richardson, ''Plague, Weather, and Wool'', AuthorHouse, 2009, p.182(344), {{ISBN|1-4389-5187-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4389-5187-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, pp. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Holbein carpet}}
These in fact are seen in paintings from many decades earlier than [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], and are sub-divided into four types (of which Holbein actually only painted two); they are the commonest designs of [[Anatolia]]n carpet seen in Western Renaissance paintings, and continued to be produced for a long period.  All are purely geometric and use a variety of arrangements of [[lozenge]]s, crosses and octagonal motifs within the main field. The sub-divisions are between:&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 26-27, 52-57. Campbell, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Type I: Small-pattern Holbein. This type is defined by an infinite repeat of small patterns, with alternating rows of octagons and staggered rows of diamonds, as seen in Holbein the Younger's ''Portrait of [[Georg Giese|Georg Gisze]]'' (1532), or the [[Somerset House Conference (painting)|Somerset House Conference]] (1608).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period.html Old Ottoman carpets], see also last note.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Erdmann| first1=Kurt| title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. = Oriental Carpets: An Essay on their History. tr. C. G. Ellis, New York, 1960.| date=1965| publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth| location=Tübingen| page=23| edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Type II: now more often called [[Lotto carpet]]s - see below.
*Type III: Large-pattern Holbein. The motifs in the field inside the border consist of one or two large squares filled with octagons, placed regularly, and separated from each other and from the borders by narrow stripes. There are no secondary "[[Gul (design)|gul]]" motifs. The carpet in Holbein's ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' is of this type.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period2.html Old Ottoman carpets], Large-pattern Type III Holbein Carpets.

Ellis, New York, 1960.| date=1965| publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth| location=Tübingen| page=25| edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Type IV: Large-pattern Holbein. Large, square, star-filled compartments are combined with secondary, smaller squares containing octagons or other "[[Gul (design)|gul]]" motifs. In contrast to the other types, which only contain patterns of equal scale, the type IV Holbein shows subordinate ornaments of unequal scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period3.html Old Ottoman carpets], Large-pattern Type IV Holbein Carpets.

===Lotto carpets===

{{Main|Lotto carpet}}
These were previously known as "small-pattern Holbein Type II", but he never painted one, unlike [[Lorenzo Lotto]], who did so several times, though he was not the first artist to show them.  Lotto is also documented as owning a large carpet, though its pattern is unknown.  They were primarily produced during the 16th and 17th centuries along the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean coast]] of [[Anatolia|Anatolia, Turkey]], but also copied in various parts of Europe, including Spain, England and Italy.  They are characterized by a lacy [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], usually in yellow on a red ground, often with blue details.&lt;ref name="King and Sylvester, p. 67"&gt;King and Sylvester, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Though they look very different from Holbein Type I carpets, they are a development of the type, where the edges of the motifs, nearly always in yellow on a red ground, take off in rigid [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]s somewhat suggesting foliage, and terminating in branched [[palmette]]s.  The type was common and long-lasting, and is also known as "Arabesque [[Ushak]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cambell, p. 189. [http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period.html Old Ottoman carpets. Type II Holbein or "Lotto" Carpets].  King and Sylvester, pp. 16, 67-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

To judge from paintings, they reached Italy by 1516, Portugal about a decade later, and reached northern Europe, including England, by the 1560s. They continue to appear in paintings until about the 1660s, especially in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="King and Sylvester, p. 67"/&gt;

=== Ghirlandaio carpets ===
{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header= | header_align = left | footer =| footer_align = left | image1 =Domenico Ghirlandaio Madonna and Child enthroned with Saint c 1483.jpg| width1 = 235 | caption1=Domenico Ghirlandaio: Madonna and Child enthroned with Saint, circa 1483 | image2=West Anatolian ‘Ghirlandaio’ Rug.jpg| width2 = 154 | caption2=West Anatolian ‘Ghirlandaio’ rug, late 17th century}}

A carpet closely related to the 1483 painting by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] was found by A. Boralevi in the Evangelical church, Hâlchiu (Heldsdorf) in [[Transylvania]], attributed to Western Anatolia, and dated to the late 15th century.&lt;ref name="15th century Ghirlandaio Rug"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ionescu|first1=Stefano|title=Transsylvanian Tale|url=http://www.transylvanianrugs.com/pdf/HALI137.pdf|website=www.transsylvanian rug|publisher=HALI 137, 53|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general design of the Ghirlandaio type, as in the 1486 painting, is related to Holbein Type 1. It is defined by one or two central medallions of diamond shape, consisting of an octagon within a square, from whose sides triangular, curvilinear patterns arise. Carpets with this medallion have been woven in the Western [[Anatolia]]n region of [[Çanakkale]] since the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yetkin|first1=Serare|title=Historical Turkish Carpets|date=1981|publisher=Turkiye is Bankasi Cultural Publications|location=Istanbul|pages=59–65|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carpet fragment with a Ghirlandaio medallion was found in the [[Divriği Great Mosque and Hospital|Divriği Great Mosque]], and dated to the 16th century.

In his essay on "Centralized Designs", Thompson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herrmann|first1=Eberhart|title=From Konya to Kokand - Rare Oriental Carpets III|date=1982|publisher=Eberhart Herrmann|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; relates the central medallion pattern of oriental carpets to the "lotus pedestal" and "cloud collar (yun chien)" motifs, used in [[Buddhist art|the art of Buddhist Asia]]. The origin of the design thus dates back to pre-Islamic times, probably [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan time]] China. Brüggemann and Boehmer further elaborate that it might have been introduced to Western Anatolia by the Seljuk, or Mongol invaders in the 11th or 13th century.&lt;ref name="Brüggemann/Boehmer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann,|first1=Werner|last2=Boehmer|first2=Harald|title=Teppiche der Bauern und Nomaden in Anatolien|date=1982|publisher=Verlag Kunst und Antiquitäten|location=Munich|isbn=3-921811-20-1|pages=60–78|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the manifold variation of patterns seen in other carpet types, the Ghirlandaio medallion design has remained largely unaltered from the 15th to the 21st century, and thus exemplifies an unusual continuity of a woven carpet design within a specific region.

=== Van Eyck and Petrus Christus: Painted carpets without surviving counterparts ===

The Netherlandish painters [[Jan van Eyck]], in his [[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele|"Paele Madonna"]], 'Lucca Madonna", and the [[Dresden Triptych]], and [[Petrus Christus]] in his "Virgin and Child with Saints Jerome and Francis" have painted four different carpets, three of them of a similar design. By the [[Realism (art)|realism]] of the depictions, these are pile-woven carpets. No directly comparable carpets have survived.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The carpet pattern depicted on [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele|"Paele Madonna"]] could be traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of [[Hisham's Palace|Khirbat al-Mafjar]].&lt;ref name="Brüggemann, Orientteppich 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich/The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar, but not identical carpets appear in the "Lucca Madonna", Dresden triptych, and "Virgin with Child and Saints" paintings which show a predominantly geometric design with a lozenge composition in infinite repeat, built up from fine bands which connect eight-pointed stars. Yetkin has identified an Anatolian carpet with a similar, but more advanced lozenge design (Yetkin, 1981, plate 47&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt; in the [[Mevlana Museum]], Konya, dated to the 17th century. She relates these carpets to 19th century Caucasian "Dragon" rugs with a similar lozenge design (p.&amp;nbsp;71&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;), and claims that carpets of a type as depicted by van Eyck and Petrus Christus are early Anatolian forerunners to the later Caucasian design.

The main borders of the carpets in the "Paele" and "Lucca Madonna", as well as in "Virgin with Child and Saints" however, each show a non-Oriental undulating trefoil stem.&lt;ref name="Ydema, 1991, p. 9"&gt;Ydema, 1991, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ornaments can be found in the borders of many carpets in Netherlandish paintings from the 15th to the beginning of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Ydema, 1991, p. 9"/&gt; The fringes of these carpets are often found at the sides of the painted carpets, not at the upper and lower ends. Either did the carpets have an uncommonly square shape, or maybe the artists have used some license and improvised with the authentic models. Alternatively, the carpets depicted by van Eyck and Petrus Christus could be of Western European manufacture. The undulating trefoil (clover) design is a well-known feature of Western Gothic ornament.&lt;ref name="Ydema, 1991, p. 9"/&gt;

== Specific carpet types ==

=== Mamluk and Ottoman Cairene carpets ===

From the middle of the 15th century onwards, a type of carpet was produced in Egypt which is characterized by a dominant central medallion, or three to five medallions in a row along the vertical axis. Numerous smaller ornaments are placed around the medallions, such as eight-pointed stars, or small ornaments composed of stylized floral elements.  The innumerable small geometric and floral ornaments give a kaleidoscopic impression. Sixty of these carpets were given to the English cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] in exchange for a license for Venetian merchants to import wine to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beattie|first1=May H.|title=The Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection of Oriental Rugs|date=1972|publisher=The Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection|location=Castagnola|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known painting representing a Mamluk carpet is Giovanni Bellinis "Portrait of the Doge of Venice Loredan and his four advisers" from 1507. A French master depicted "The Three De Coligny brothers" in 1555. Another representation can be found on Ambrosius Frankens "The Last Supper", about 1570. The large medallion is depicted in a way that it forms the nimbus of the head of Christ. The characteristic mamluk carpet ornaments are clearly visible. Ydema has documented a total of 16 dateable representations of Mamluk carpets.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1517 Ottoman conquest of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt, two different cultures merged, as is seen on Mamluk carpets woven after this date. After the conquest, the Cairene weavers adopted an Ottoman Turkish design.&lt;ref name="Ottoman Cairene carpet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottoman-Cairene carpet in the Met. Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/452308|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these carpets continued in Egypt into the early 17th century.&lt;ref name="Ottoman Cairene carpets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|last2=Franses|first2=M.|title=East Mediterranean carpets in the Victoria and Albert Museum|journal=Hali|date=1981|volume=IV|issue=1|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carpet of the Ottoman Cairene type is depicted in Ludovicus Finsonius' painting "The Annunciation". Its border design and guard borders are the same as a carpet in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 21–25&lt;/ref&gt; A similar carpet has been depicted by Adriaen van der Venne in "Geckie met de Kous", 1630. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]]s "Christ in the House of Mary and Martha", 1628, shows the characteristic S-stems ending in double sickle-shaped lancet leaves. Various carpets of the Ottoman Cairene type are depicted in [[Moretto da Brescia]]s frescoes in the "Sala delle Dame" at the [[Palazzo Salvadego]] in Brescia, Italy.

=== "Chequerboard"- or Compartment carpets from the 17. century ===

An extremely rare group of carpets, "chequerboard" carpets were assumed to be a later and derivative continuum of the Mamluk and Ottoman Cairene group of carpets. Only about 30 of these carpets survived. They are distinguished by their design composed of rows of squares with triangles in each corner enclosing a star pattern. All "chequerboard" carpets have borders with cartouches and lobed medallions. Their attribution is still under debate. The colours and patterns resemble those seen in Mamluk carpets, however, they are "S-spun" and "Z-twisted" and thus similar to early anatolian and caucasian carpets. Since the early days of carpet science they are attributed to [[Damascus]]. Pinner and Franses champion this attribution because Syria was part first of the Mamluk, later of the Ottoman Empire at that time. This would explain the similarities with the colours and patterns of the Cairene carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=Robert|last2=Franses|first2=Michael|title=East mediterranean carpets in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|journal=Hali|date=1981|volume=4|issue=1|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current dating of the chequerboard carpets is also consistent with European collection inventories from the early 17th century. Carpets of the "chequerboard" type are depicted on [[Pietro Paolini]]s (1603−1681) "''Self portrait''", as well as on [[Gabriël Metsu]]s painting "''The musical party''".

=== Large Ushak (star and medallion) carpets ===
In contrast to the relatively large number of surviving carpets of this type, relatively few of them are represented in Renaissance paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Star Ushak''' carpets were often woven in large formats. As such, they represent a typical product of higher organized, town manufacture. They are characterized by large dark blue star shaped primary medallions in infinite repeat on a red ground field containing a secondary floral scroll. The design was likely influenced by northwest Persian book design, or by Persian carpet medallions.&lt;ref name="Star Ushak"&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Ushak, Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/451471|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As compared to the medallion Ushak carpets, the concept of the infinite repeat in star Ushak carpets is more accentuated and in keeping with the early Turkish design tradition.&lt;ref name="Star Ushak - Turkish design"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tapis - Present de l'orient a l'occident|date=1989|publisher=L'Institut du Monde Arabe|location=Paris|isbn=9782906062283|page=4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their strong allusion to the inifinite repeat, the star Ushak design can be used on carpets of various size and in many varying dimensions.

'''Medallion Ushak''' carpets usually have a red or blue field decorated with a floral trellis or leaf tendrils, ovoid primary medallions alternating with smaller eight-lobed stars, or lobed medallions, intertwined with floral tracery. Their border frequently contains palmettes on a floral and leaf scroll, and pseudo-kufic characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medallion Ushak carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/445311|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known representation of a Medallion Ushak was painted in 1656 by [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] in his painting [[The Procuress (Vermeer)|"The Procuress"]]. It is placed horizontally; the upper or lower end with the star-shaped corner medallion can be seen. Under the woman's hand which holds the glass, a part of a characteristic Ushak medallion can be seen. The carpet seen on Vermeer's "Music lesson", "Girl reading a letter at an open window", and "The Concert" hardly show any differences in the details of the design or the weaving structure indicate that all three pictures might trace back to one single carpet Vermeer might have had at his studio. The painings by Vermeer, Steen, and Verkolje depict a special type of Ushak carpet of which no surviving counterpart is known. It is characterized by its rather sombre colours, coarse weaving, and patterns with a more degenerated curvilinear design.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 39–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpets remained an important way of enlivening the background of full-length portraits throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, for example in the English portraits of [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]].&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The finely-knotted silk carpets woven in the time of [[Shah Abbas I]] at [[Kashan]] and [[Isfahan]] are rarely represented in paintings, as they were doubtless very unusual in European homes;&lt;ref&gt;Examples in Polish collections led to their being miscalled "Polish carpets" in the 19th century, a misnomer that has stuck: "representations of 'Polish' silk rugs in paintings are rare" report Dimand and Mailey 1973, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; however, ''A Lady playing the Theorbo''. by [[Gerard Terborch]] ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],  14.40.617) shows such a carpet laid upon the table on which the lady's cavalier is sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Dimand and Jean Mailey, ''Oriental Rugs in The Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' p. 60, fig.83.&lt;/ref&gt; Floral "Isfahan" carpets of the [[Herat]] type, on the other hand, were exported in great numbers to Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands, and are often represented in interiors painted by Velásquez, Rubens, Van Dyck, Vermeer, Terborch, de Hooch, Bol and Metsu, where the dates established for the paintings provide a yardstick for establishing the chronology of the designs.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand and Mailey 1973, p 67, illustrating floral Herat rugs in  ''A Visit to the Nursery'' by [[Gabriel Metsu]] (Metropolitan Museum of Art,  17.190.20), p. 67,fig. 94; ''Portrait of Omer Talon'', by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 1649 ([[National Gallery of Art, Washington]], p.70, fig. 98); ''Woman with a Water Jug'', by Jan Vermeer (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 89.15.21, p.71, fig. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony van Dyck]]'s royal and aristocratic subjects had mostly progressed to Persian carpets, but less wealthy sitters are still shown with the Turkish types. The 1620 "Portrait of Abraham Graphaeus" by [[Cornelis de Vos]], and [[Thomas de Keyser]]s "Portrait of an unknown man" (1626) and "Portrait of Constantijn Huyghens and his clerk" (1627) are amongst the earliest paintings depicting a new type of Ottoman Turkish manufactory carpet, which was exported to Europe in large quantities, probably in order to meet the increasing demand. A large number of similar carpets were preserved in Transylvania, which was an important center of Turkish carpet trade during the 15th–17th century. Hence carpets of this type are known by a term of convenience as "Transylvanian carpets".&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 48–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ionescu|first1=Stefano|title=Antique Ottoman Rugs in Transylvania|date=2005|publisher=Verduci Editore|location=Rome|edition=1st|url=http://www.transylvanianrugs.com/pdf/01.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pieter de Hooch]]s 1663 painting "Portrait of a family making music" depicts an Ottoman prayer rug of the "Transylvanian" type.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In the American colonies Isaac Royall and his family were painted by [[Robert Feke]] in 1741, posed round a table spread with a [[Bergama]] rug.&lt;ref&gt;In the collection of Harvard University Law School; illustrated in Dimand and Mailey 1973, p.193, fig. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-century European direct trade with [[India]] brought [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]] versions of Persian patterns to Europe.  Painters of the [[Dutch Golden Age]] showed their skill by depiction of light effects on table-carpets, like [[Vermeer]] in his ''Music Lesson'' ([[Royal Collection]]).  By this date they have become common in the homes of the reasonably well-to-do, as is shown by historical documentation of inventories. Carpets are sometimes depicted in scenes of debauchery from the prosperous [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the century Oriental carpets had lost much of their status as prestige objects, and the grandest sitters for portraits were more likely to be shown on the high-quality Western carpets, like [[Savonnerie manufactory|Savonneries]], now being produced, whose less intricate patterns were also easier to depict in a [[painterly]] manner. A number of [[orientalism|Orientalist]] European painters continued to accurately depict Oriental carpets, now usually in Oriental settings.

== Perception of Oriental carpets during the Renaissance ==

[[File:P boel martwa natura globus l.jpeg|thumb|[[Pieter Boel]], Still life with globe and parrot, circa 1658]]

The perception of Oriental carpets during the Renaissance is characterized by three main aspects: 
# Due to their perceived rarity, preciousness and strangeness, Oriental carpets were depicted as a background for saints and religious scenes. Later on, the religious iconography was taken over by politically powerful persons in order to assert their status and power.
# Oriental carpets were more generally perceived as a rare commodity, and objects of luxury and decoration. From the mid 16th century onwards, the iconological context sometimes extended towards the idea of profligacy or vanity.
# When contacts, often of a violent nature, grew closer between the Islamic world and Europe, Oriental carpets were sometimes used as a symbol of Christian self-assertion.
In any case, Oriental carpets were used in Western Europe in different ways and contexts than in the Islamic world, and their original cultural context was never fully understood.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"/&gt;

=== Sacred Ground - or "Christian Oriental Carpets"? ===
Oriental carpets appear for the first time on early Renaissance paintings of the late 12th century. In most cases the carpets serve as a background for religious scenes. Saints were depicted enthroned or standing on carpets, thus being elated, and separated from their surroundings.
Ordinary people, often the donors of the painting, were sometimes allowed to participate in the atmosphere of holiness by depicting them near the holy person, or literally kneeling or standing "on the same carpet" as the saint. This context is still understood and at times used today.&lt;ref name="Pope's coffin placed on Bijar carpet, 2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope John Paul II's coffin placed on a Bijar carpet during his funeral mass|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2919279.ece|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation of the religious context has been proposed by V. Gantzhorn in 1998: He compared in detail the patterns and symbols of both the Renaissance paintings and surviving carpets with ancient ornaments, for example with [[Armenian art|Armenian]] [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|illuminated manuscripts]]. He concluded that the majority of the surviving and painted carpets alike were produced by Christian Armenian weavers. The hidden Christian symbolism of the carpet patterns had therefore made the so-called "Christian oriental carpets" appropriate adornments for Western European Christian churches. Following this hypothesis, the lack of contemporary Western European written sources, which could otherwise provide independent evidence to support Gantzhorns claims, is explained by the fact that the knowledge of the hidden symbols was subject to oral tradition, and restricted to a small religious élite. The [[Armenian Genocide]] had led to the loss of the oral tradition, and, subsequently, to an incorrect "Islamic" attribution of the carpets by the majority of Western art historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gantzhorn|first1=Volkmar|title=Orientalische Teppiche : eine Darstellung der ikonographischen und ikonologischen Entwicklung von den Anfängen bis zum 18.

=== Objects of luxury and decoration ===

We do not understand exactly how Renaissance artists thought about the Oriental carpets they were depicting. We know that the Venetian [[Piazza San Marco]] was adorned with carpets hanging from the windows of the surrounding palaces and houses on special occasions. Like the beautiful ladies looking out of the windows, the carpets function as a decorative framework, and highlight the important action which is going on. Similar to the inaccurate [[pseudo-kufic]] writing in contemporary paintings, the European artists borrowed something from another culture which they, essentially, did not understand.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"/&gt;

In a series of letters&lt;ref name="Letters by AD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupprich|first1=Hans (ed.)|title=A. Dürer. Schriftlicher Nachlass / Writings|date=1956|publisher=Deutscher Verein für Kunstwissenschaft|location=Berlin|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Venice dated 18 August - 13 October 1506,&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Europe and the Oriental Rug"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Europa und der Orientteppich / Europe and the Oriental Rug|date=1962|publisher=Florian Kupferberg Verlag|location=Mainz|page=49|edition=1st|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German painter [[Albrecht Dürer]] tells his friend [[Willibald Pirckheimer]] about his efforts to buy two carpets for him in Venice:

{{Quotation|''Vnd dy 2 tebich will mir Anthoni Kolb awff daz hubschpt, preytest vnd wolfeillest helfen khawffen. So jch sy hab, will jch sy dem jungen Im Hoff geben, daz er ys ewch einschlache. Awch will jch sehen noch den kranchs federen.''&lt;br&gt;
"Anthoni Kolb will help me buying 2 carpets, the nicest, broadest and cheapest [we can get]. As soon as I have them, I will hand them over to the young Im Hoff, and he will prepare them for transport. I will look for crane feathers as well."

(18 August 1506)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''Jtem allen fleis hab jch an kertt mit den tewichen, kan aber kein preiten an kumen. Sy sind al schmall vnd lang. Aber noch hab jch altag forschung dornoch, awch der Anthoni Kolb.''&lt;br&gt;
"I've done all I could with the carpets, but I cannot get any of the broad ones. They are all narrow and oblong. I'm continuing my search every day, Anthoni Kolb as well."

(8 September 1506)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''Jch hab awch zwen dewich bestelt, dy würd jch morgen tzalen. Aber jch hab sy nit wolfell kunen kawffen.''&lt;br&gt;
"I've ordered two carpets, and will pay for them tomorrow. But I could not buy at a cheap price."

(13 October 1506)|Albrecht Dürer, letters from Venice to Willibald Pirckheimer&lt;ref name="Letters by AD"/&gt;}}

Dürer was buying various exotic luxury goods for Pirckheimer in Venice, and he mentions the two carpets amongst gold, jewels, or crane feathers. We do not know if Dürer in any way attributed artistic value to these carpets. No oriental carpets were ever depicted by Dürer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raby|first1=Julian|title=Venice, Dürer, and the oriental mode|date=1982|publisher=Islamic Art Publications|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0856671623|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very common type of [[genre painting]] of the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]], the so-called [[Merry Company]] type of painting, depicts a group of people enjoying themselves, usually seated with drinks, and often music-making. In these pictures, Oriental carpets often cover and decorate the table, or are spread over the furniture. As such, they either underline the wealth and respectability of the portrayed, or add a context of exoticism and profligacy to brothel scenes, or scenes of debauchery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Westermann|first1=Mariët|title=A worldly art : the Dutch Republic, 1585-1718|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0300107234|edition=2nd reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th century, Oriental carpets were often depicted in [[still life]] paintings. Assorted valuable, exotic objects like Chinese porcelain bowls and animals like parrots are depicted, often with an allegorical meaning, or symbolizing "[[vanitas]]", the futility of human life. The allusion to futility is made apparent by the inclusion of symbols like a human skull, or inscriptions quoting the biblical book of [[Ecclesiastes]] {{bibleref2-nb|Ecclesiastes|1:2;12:8|KJV}}. As early as 1533, Hans Holbein's painting [[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|"The Ambassadors"]] prominently shows an [[anamorphic projection]] of a human skull. Objects in still lifes, regardless of their allegorical meaning, are often placed on precious velvet table cloths, marble plates, or oriental carpets. As such, Oriental carpets are treated similar to other precious objects or materials, the focus being on their material value and decorative effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergström|first1=Ingvar|title=Dutch still-life painting in the seventeenth century|date=1983|publisher=Hacker art books|location=New York|isbn=978-0878172795|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objects of European self-assertion ===
In September 1479 the Venetian painter [[Gentile Bellini]] was sent by the Venetian Senate as a cultural [[ambassador]] to Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]'s new [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital [[Constantinople]] as part of the peace settlement between Venice and the Turks. [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] wrote that Bellini "portrayed the Emperor Mahomet from the life so well, that it was held a miracle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vasari|first1=Giorgio|editor1-last=du C. de Vere|editor1-first=Gaston|editor2-last=Jack|editor2-first=Philip|title=The lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors, and architects|date=2005|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=978-0375760365|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dating and authorship of the portrait by Bellini have been placed in question,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng3099 |title=The Sultan Mehmet II |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826181140/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG3099 |archivedate=2007-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Bellini is the first great Renaissance painter who actually visited an Islamic Sultan's court.

The influence of Bellinis encounter with the Islamic world is reflected by Oriental motifs appearing in several of his paintings. His 1507 ''St. Mark Preaching at Alexandria'' anachronistically shows the patron saint of Venice preaching to Muslims. The architecture shown in the background is an incongruous assortment of buildings, not corresponding to contemporary Islamic architecture. The stage-like setting for St Mark's sermon is adorned by exotic animals like a camel and a giraffe, as well as architectural elements like an ancient Egyptian [[obelisk]], in the background.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"/&gt; Bellini's use of these decorative elements resembles the way Oriental carpets are depicted in 14th and 15th century Renaissance paintings: They are depictions of the exotic and the precious, they set a stage for an important person or action, but, as yet, essentially ignore their original cultural context.

The 1547 depiction of King [[Edward VI of England]] standing on an Oriental carpet, in front of a throne on the same carpet asserts the young [[Fidei defensor]]'s strength and power, by a deliberate echo of the pose of his father's famous portrait by Holbein.

Nothing is known about how much [[Ambrosius Francken]] knew about the cultural background of the Mamluk carpet which he used as a decoration for his ''Last Supper''. The painting can only be roughly dated to the 16th century. The use of the central medallion of an Oriental carpet to highlight the [[Halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] of Christ, however, represents a special case: The use of the motif could either have resulted from a mere similarity of the two pictorial patterns, but it can also be understood as an assertion of Renaissance Christian predominance. Europeans had reasons to fear the Islamic world: In 1529, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] was [[Siege of Vienna|besieging Vienna]], and the Ottoman Empire remained a constant threat to Western Europe until the late 17th century.

In his 1502–9 cycle of the Piccolomini library frescoes at the Dome of Siena, [[Pinturicchio]] depicts [[Pope Pius II]] convoking, as the Latin inscription explains, a Diet of Princes at [[Mantua]] to proclaim a new [[crusade]] in 1459. On the eighth fresco, a table in front of the Pope's throne is covered by an Oriental carpet. It was hypothesized that the carpet might have been a trophy from previous expeditions.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"/&gt;

Precious Oriental carpets were part of the so-called "''[[:de:Türkenbeute|Türkenbeute]]''" (lit.: "Turkish loot") from the [[Battle of Vienna|siege of Vienna]] which ended on 12 September 1683 and their new Christian owners proudly reported back home about their plunder. Carpets exist with inscriptions indicating the new owner, and the date when it was acquired:

{{Quotation|'''''A. D. Wilkonski XII septembris 1683 z pod Wiednia''''' &lt;br&gt; "A. D. Wilkonski, Vienna, 12 September 1683"|Inscription on the backside of an Oriental "Polonaise" carpet, once in the Moore collection, current location unknown.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt;}}

The majority of Oriental carpets, however, continue to be depicted as objects with visual appeal, without political connotations, but ignoring their original cultural context. It was reserved to a later century to try and reach out for a better understanding of the carpets within their Islamic cultural context. Whilst Islamic carpets initially served to adorn Renaissance paintings, later on the paintings contributed to a better understanding of the carpets. Comparative art historical research on Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting thus adds another facette, and leads to a better understanding of the highly multifaceted, and sometimes ambivalent, image of the Ottomans during the Western European Renaissance.

A '''panel painting''' is a painting made on a flat panel made of [[wood]], either a single piece, or a number of pieces joined together. Until [[canvas]] became the more popular support medium in the 16th century, it was the normal form of support for a painting not on a wall ([[fresco]]) or [[vellum]], which was used for [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and paintings for the framing.

==History==
[[File:Fayum Portrait of a Boy (detail).jpg|thumb|left|Boy from [[Al-Fayum]], 2nd century CE (a [[Fayum mummy portraits|mummy portrait]]). Encaustic on wood—note the cracks.]]
Panel painting is very old; it was a very prestigious medium in Greece and Rome, but only very few examples of ancient panel paintings have survived. A series of 6th century BC painted tablets from [[Pitsa panels|Pitsa]] ([[Greece]]) represent the oldest surviving Greek panel paintings. Most classical Greek paintings that were famous in their day seem to have been of a size comparable to smaller modern works - perhaps up to a half-length portrait size.  However, for a generation in the second quarter of the fifth-century BC there was a movement, called the "new painting" and led by [[Polygnotus]], for very large painted [[frieze]]s, apparently painted on wood, decorating the interiors of public buildings with very large and complicated subjects containing numerous figures at least half life-size, and including battle scenes. We can only attempt to imagine what these looked like from some detailed literary descriptions and vase-paintings that appear to echo their compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 103-104 (illus. 105)&lt;/ref&gt;  The first century BC to third century AD [[Fayum mummy portraits]], preserved in the exceptionally dry conditions of Egypt, provide the bulk of surviving panel painting from the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman period]] - about 900 face or bust portraits survive.  The [[Severan Tondo]], also from Egypt (about 200AD) is one of the handful of non-funerary Graeco-Roman specimens to survive. Wood has always been the normal support for the [[Icon]]s of [[Byzantine art]] and the later [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] traditions, the earliest of which (all in [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]) date from the 5th or 6th centuries, and are the oldest panel paintings which seem to be of the highest contemporary quality.  [[Encaustic painting|Encaustic]] and [[tempera]] are the two techniques used in antiquity. Encaustic largely ceased to be used after the early Byzantine icons.

Although there seem from literary references to have been some panel paintings produced in Western Europe through the centuries between [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, and Byzantine icons were imported, there are next to no survivals in an unaltered state.  In the 12th century panel painting experienced a revival because of new liturgical practices—the priest and congregation were now on the same side of the altar, leaving the space behind the altar free for the display of a holy image—and thus altar decorations were in demand. The earliest forms of panel painting were [[dossal]]s (altar backs), altar fronts and [[crucifixes]]. All were painted with religious images, commonly the Christ or the Virgin, with the saints appropriate to the dedication of the church, and the local town or diocese, or to the donor.  [[Donor portrait]]s including members of the donor's  family are also often shown, usually kneeling to the side.  They were for some time a cheaper alternative to the far more prestigious equivalents in metalwork, decorated with gems, [[Tooth enamel|enamel]]s, and perhaps ivory figures, most of which have long been broken up for their valuable materials.  Painted panels for altars are most numerous in Spain, especially [[Catalonia]], which is explained by the poverty of the country at this time, as well as the lack of Reformation [[iconoclasm]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 263&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13th and 14th centuries in Italy were a great period of panel painting, mostly [[altarpiece]]s or other religious works. However, it is estimated that of all the panel paintings produced there, 99.9 percent have been lost.  The vast majority of [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s are on panel, and these include most of the earliest [[portrait]]s, such as those by [[Jan van Eyck]], and some other secular scenes.  However, one of the earliest surviving oils on [[canvas]] is a French ''Madonna with angels'' of about 1410 in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]], which is very early indeed for oil painting also.  In these works the frame and panel are sometimes a single piece of wood, as with [[Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)]] by van Eyck ([[National Gallery, London]]), where the frame was also painted, including an inscription done illusionistically to resemble carving.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 216&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Meister des Frankfurter Paradiesgärtleins 001.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Frankfurt]] ''[[Paradiesgärtlein]]'', a German panel painting from ''circa'' 1410]]

By the 15th century with the increased wealth of Europe, and later the appearance of humanism, and a changing attitude about the function of art and patronage, panel painting went in new directions. Secular art opened the way to the creation of chests, painted beds, birth trays and other furniture.  Many such works are now detached and hung framed on walls in museums.  Many double-sided wings of altarpieces (see picture at top) have also been sawn into two one-sided panels.

Canvas took over from panel in Italy by the first half of the 16th century, a change led by [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and the artists of Venice (which made the finest canvas at this point, for sails).  In the [[Netherlands]] the change took about a century longer, and panel paintings remained common, especially in Northern Europe, even after the cheaper and more portable canvas had become the main support medium.  The young [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and many other painters preferred it for the greater precision that could be achieved with a totally solid support, and many of his most important works also used it, even for paintings over four metres long in one dimension.  His panels are of notoriously complicated construction, containing as many as seventeen pieces of wood (''Het Steen'', [[National Gallery, London]]).   For smaller [[cabinet painting]]s, copper sheets (often old [[printmaking]] plates) were another rival support, from the end of the 16th century, used by many artists including [[Adam Elsheimer]].  Many Dutch painters of the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Golden Age]] used panel for their small works, including [[Rembrandt]] on occasion.  By the 18th century it had become unusual to paint on panel, except for small works to be inset into furniture, and the like.  But, for example, The National Gallery in London has two [[Goya]] portraits on panel.

Many other painting traditions also painted, and still paint, on wood, but the term is usually only used to refer to the Western tradition described above.

==Panel construction and preparation==
[[File:Angelsatmamre-trinity-rublev-1410.jpg|thumb|right|Russian [[icon]] by [[Andrey Rublev]], early 15th century, on a three piece panel. The raised edges are probably gesso rather than wood]]
The technique is known to us through [[Cennino Cennini]]'s ''The Craftsman's Handbook'' (''Il libro dell' arte'') published in 1390, and other sources.  It changed little over the centuries.  It was a laborious and painstaking process:
*A carpenter would construct a solid wood piece the size of the panel needed. Usually a radial cut piece was preferred (across rather than along the length of the tree; the opposite of most timber cuts), with the outer sapwood excluded. In Italy it was usually seasoned poplar, willow or linden. It would be planed and sanded and if needed, joined with other pieces to obtain the desired size and shape.
*The wood would be coated with a mixture of animal-skin glues and resin and covered with linen (the mixture and linen combination was known as a "size"); this might be done by a specialist, or in the artists studio.
*Once the size had dried, layer upon layer of [[gesso]] would be applied, each layer sanded down before the next applied, sometimes as many as 15 layers, before a smooth hard surface emerged, not unlike ivory.  This stage was not necessarily done after the 16th century, or darker grounds were used.

==Painting techniques==
Once the panel construction was complete, the design was laid out, usually in charcoal.

The usual ancient painting technique was [[encaustic painting|encaustic]], used at Al-Fayum and in the earliest surviving Byzantine icons, which are at the Saint Catherine's Monastery. This uses heated wax as the medium for the pigments.

This was replaced before the end of first millennium by [[tempera]], which uses an egg-yolk medium.  Using small brushes dipped in a mixture of pigment and egg-yolk, the paint was applied in very small, almost transparent, brushstrokes. Thin layers of paint would be used to create volumetric forms.

By the beginning of the 15th century, [[oil painting]] was developed. This was more tolerant, and allowed the exceptional detail of Early Netherlandish art. This used a very painstaking multi-layered technique, where the painting, or a particular part of it, had to be left for a couple of days for one layer to dry before the next was applied.

==Conservation and scientific analysis==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 071.jpg|thumb|left|''Landscape with rainbow'' 94 x 123 cm, 1636-8. A large [[Rubens]] panel painting, with a panel made out of many pieces]]
Wood panels, especially if kept with too little humidity, often warp and crack with age, and from the 19th century, when reliable techniques were developed, many have been [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas or modern board supports]].

Wood panel is now rather more useful to art historians than canvas, and in recent decades there has been great progress in extracting this information - and many fakes discovered and mistaken datings corrected.  Specialists can identify the tree species used, which varied according to the area where the painting was made.  [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon-dating]] techniques can give an approximate date-range (typically to about a range of about 20 years), and [[dendrochronology]] sequences have been developed for the main source areas of timber for panels.  Italian paintings used local or sometimes [[Dalmatia]]n wood, most often [[Populus|poplar]], but including [[chestnut]], [[walnut]], [[oak]] and other woods.  The Netherlands ran short of local timber early in the 15th century, and most Early Netherlandish masterpieces are Baltic [[oak]], often [[Poland|Polish]], cut north of [[Warsaw]] and shipped down the [[Vistula]], across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Southern German painters often used [[pine]], and [[mahogany]] imported into Europe was used by later painters, including examples by [[Rembrandt]] and Goya.

In theory, dendro-chronology gives an exact felling date, but in practice allowances have to be made for a seasoning period of several years, and a small panel may be from the centre of the tree, with no way of knowing how many rings outside the panel there were.  So dendro-chronological conclusions tend to be expressed as a "terminus post quem" or an earliest possible date, with a tentative estimate of an actual date, that may be twenty or more years later.

The  so-called ''Panel Paintings Initiative'' is a multi-year project in collaboration between the Getty Conservation Institute, the [[Getty Foundation]], and the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]. The Panel Paintings Initiative is a response to the growing recognition that significant collections of paintings on wood panels may be at risk in coming decades due to the waning numbers of conservators and craftspeople with the highly specialized skills required for the conservation of these complex works of art.&lt;ref&gt;More information on the objectives of the project can be found on [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/education/panelpaintings/ The Getty website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of wood==
Artists would typically use wood native to the region. [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528), for example, painted on [[Populus|poplar]] when he was in Venice and on oak when in the Netherlands and southern Germany. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) used [[oak]] for his paintings in France; Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5–1545) and [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] (1497/8–1543) used oak while working in southern Germany and England. In the Middle Ages, spruce and lime were used in the Upper Rhine and often in Bavaria. Outside of the Rhineland, softwood (such as pinewood) was mainly used. Of a group of twenty Norwegian altar frontals from the Gothic period (1250–1350) fourteen were made of fir, two of oak, and four of pine (Kaland 1982). Large altars made in Denmark during the fifteenth century used oak for the figures as well as for the painted wings. Lime was popular with [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (ca. 1480–1538), [[Baldung Grien]], [[Christoph Amberger]] (d. 1562), Dürer, and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1472–1553). Cranach often used [[beech]] wood—an unusual choice. In Northern Europe, poplar is very rarely found, but [[walnut]] and [[chestnut]] are not uncommon. In the northeast and south, coniferous trees such as [[spruce]], and various types of [[fir]], and [[pine]] have been used. Fir wood is shown to have been used in the Upper and Middle Rhine, [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]], and [[Saxony]]. Pinewood was used mainly in [[County of Tyrol|Tirol]] and beech wood only in [[Saxony]]. However, in general, oak was the most common substrate used for panel making in the [[Low Countries]], northern Germany, and the [[Rhineland]] around [[Cologne]]. In France, until the seventeenth century, most panels were made from oak, although a few made of walnut and poplar have been found.

The oak favored as a support by the painters of the northern school was, however, not always of local origin. In the seventeenth century about four thousand full-grown oak trees were needed to build a medium-sized merchant ship; thus, imported wood was necessary. Oak coming from Königsberg as well as [[Gdańsk]] is often found among works by Flemish and Dutch artists from the 15th through the 17th centuries - the origin can be established by the patterns of [[growth ring]]s. In the last decade of the seventeenth century, [[Wilhelmus Beurs]], a Dutch writer on painting techniques, considered oak to be the most useful wooden substrate on which to paint. However, exceptions are seen rather early in the seventeenth century: sometimes walnut, [[pear]]wood, [[cedar wood|cedarwood]], or Indian woods were used. [[Mahogany]] was already in use by a number of painters during the first decades of the seventeenth century and was used often in the Netherlands in the nineteenth century. Even so, when canvas or copper was not used, the main oeuvre of the northern school was painted on oak panels.&lt;ref&gt;Wadum pp.149-177&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''penciller''' (or '''penciler''') is a [[collaboration]] artist who works in creation of [[comic book]]s, [[graphic novel]]s, and similar visual art forms, with focus on primary pencil illustrations, hence the term "penciller".

In the [[American comic book]] industry, the penciller is the first step in rendering the story in visual form,&lt;ref&gt;[[Fox, Margalit]] (April 5, 2013). [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/arts/carmine-infantino-who-revamped-batman-and-the-flash-dies-at-87.html?_r=1&amp; "Carmine Infantino, Reviver of Batman and Flash, Dies at 87"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and may require several steps of feedback with the writer. These artists are concerned with layout (positions and vantages on scenes) to showcase steps in the plot.

==Tools and materials==
A penciller works in [[pencil]]. Beyond this basic description, however, different artists choose to use a wide variety of different tools. While many artists use traditional wood pencils, others prefer [[mechanical pencil]]s or drafting leads. Pencillers may use any lead hardness they wish, although many artists use a harder lead (like a [[2H lead|2H]]) to make light lines for initial sketches, then turn to a slightly softer lead (like a [[HB lead|HB]]) for finishing phases of the drawing. Still other artists do their initial layouts using a [[Non-photo blue|light-blue]] [[colored pencil]] because that color tends to disappear during [[photocopying]].

Most US comic book pages are drawn oversized on large sheets of paper, usually [[Bristol board]].&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Brian (January 15, 2009). [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/01/15/comic-book-legends-revealed-190/ "Comic Book Legends Revealed #190"]. [[Comic Book Resources]].&lt;/ref&gt; The customary size of comic book pages in the mainstream [[United States|American]] comics industry is 11 by 17 inches. The [[inker]] usually works directly over the penciller's pencil marks, though occasionally pages are inked on [[translucent]] paper, such as drafting [[vellum]], preserving the original pencils. The artwork is later photographically reduced in size during the printing process. With the advent of digital illustration programs such as [[Photoshop]], more and more artwork is produced digitally, either in part or entirely (see below).

==Notable creators and their techniques==
;Jack Kirby
From 1949 until his retirement, [[Jack Kirby]] worked out of a ten-foot-wide basement studio dubbed "The Dungeon" by his family. When starting with clean piece of Bristol board, he would first draw his panel lines with a [[T-square]].&lt;ref name=HeroComplex&gt;Kirby, Neal. "Growing Up Kirby". ''Hero Complex'' (July 2012). ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. pp 22 and 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Arthur Adams
[[Arthur Adams (comics)|Arthur Adams]] begins drawing thumbnail layouts from the script he's given, either at home or in a public place. The thumbnails range in size from 2 inches x 3 inches to half the size of the printed comic book. He or an assistant will then enlarge the thumbnails and trace them onto [[illustration board]] with a [[non-photo blue pencil]], sometimes using a [[Prismacolor]] light-blue pencil, because it is not too waxy, and erases easily. When working on the final illustration board, he does so on a large drawing board when in his basement studio, and a lapboard when sitting on his living room couch. After tracing the thumbnails, he will then clarify details with another light-blue pencil, and finalize the details with a [[Number 2 pencil]]. He drew the first three chapters of "[[Jonni Future]]" at twice the printed comic size, and also drew the fifth chapter, "The Garden of the Sklin", at a size larger than standard, in order to render more detail than usual in those stories. For a large poster image with a multitude of characters, he will go over the figure outlines with a marker in order to emphasize them. He will use photographic reference when appropriate, as when he draws things that he is not accustomed to.&lt;ref name="CBA#17"&gt;Cooke, Jon B.

''Modern Masters Volume Six: Arthur Adams'', 2006, TwoMorrows Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.&lt;ref&gt;Siuntres, John (September 11, 2013).

;Jim Lee
Artist [[Jim Lee]] is known to use [[Pencil#Grading and classification|F lead]] for his pencil work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Campbell, J. Scott]] (2008). [http://j-scott-campbell.deviantart.com/art/Pencils-79071837 "Artist's Comments"].

;J. Scott Campbell
Artist [[J. Scott Campbell]] does his pencil with a [[lead holder]], and Sanford Turquoise [[H lead]], which he uses for its softness and darkness, and for its ability to provide a "sketchy" feel, with a minimal amount of powdery lead smearing. He uses this lead because it strikes a balance between too hard, and therefore not dark enough on the page, and too soft, and therefore prone to smearing and crumbling. Campbell avoids its closest competitor because he finds it too waxy. Campbell has also used [[HB lead]] and F lead. He maintains sharpness of the lead with a Berol Turquoise sharpener, changing them every four to six months, which he finds is the duration of their grinding ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Campbell, J. Scott|title=Pencils|url=http://j-scott-campbell.deviantart.com/art/Pencils-79071837|publisher=DeviantArt|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell uses a combination of Magic Rub erasers, eraser sticks, and since he began to ink his work digitally, a Sakura [[electric eraser]]. He often sharpens the eraser to a cornered edge in order to render fine detailed work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Campbell, J.

;Travis Charest
Artist [[Travis Charest]] uses mainly 2H lead to avoid smearing, and sometimes [[HB lead]]. He previously illustrated on regular illustration board provided by publishers, though he disliked the [[non-photo blue]] lines printed on them. By 2000, he switched to Crescent board for all his work, because it does not warp when wet, produces sharper illustrations, and are more suitable for framing because they lack the non-photo blue lines.&lt;ref name=Materials&gt;[[Charest, Travis|Travis Charest]].

Accessed August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Charest usually prefers not to employ preliminary sketching practices, such as layouts, thumbnails or [[lightbox]]ing, in part due to impatience, and in part because he enjoys the serendipitous nature in which artwork develops when produced with greater spontaneity.&lt;ref&gt;Charest, Travis. [http://travischarestgallery.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=faq#techniques FAQ: "Working techniques"]. The Official Unofficial Travis Charest Gallery. December 1, 2000; Accessed August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He also prefers to use reference only when rendering objects that require a degree of real-life accuracy, such as guns, vehicles or characters of licensed properties that must resemble actors with whom they are closely identified, as when he illustrated the cover to ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation: Embrace the Wolf]]'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Charest, Travis.

;Adam Hughes
The penciling process that artist [[Adam Hughes]] employs for his cover work is the same he uses when doing sketches for fans at conventions, with the main difference being that he does cover work in his sketchbook, before transferring the drawing to virgin art board with a lightbox,&lt;ref name=YouTubePart2&gt;Coulson, Steve. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAO3sUyg-Bw&amp;feature=related "Adam Hughes - Anatomy of a sketch, Pt2 - The Process"]. [[YouTube]]. May 15, 2006. Accessed September 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whereas he does convention drawings on 11 x 14 Strathmore bristol, as he prefers penciling on the rougher, [[vellum]] surface rather than smooth paper, preferring smoother paper only for brush inking.&lt;ref name=YouTubePart3&gt;Coulson, Steve.

Accessed September 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; because he feels regular pencils get worn down to the nub too quickly. As he explained during a sketch demonstration at a comic book convention, during this process he uses a Sanford Turquoise [[4B lead]], a soft lead, though when working at home in Atlanta, where the humid weather tends to dampen the paper, he sometimes uses a [[B lead]] or [[2B lead]], which acts like a 4B in that environment.&lt;ref name=YouTubePart3/&gt; However, his website explains that he uses 6B lead, with some variation. For pieces rendered entirely in pencil, he employs a variety of pencil leads of varying degrees of hardness.&lt;ref name=OfficialFAQ&gt;[http://www.justsayah.com/faq/ "FAQ"]. Just Say AH! Retrieved November 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; After darkening in the construction lines that he wishes to keep, he erases the lighter ones with a [[kneaded eraser]] before rendering greater detail.&lt;ref name=YouTubePart1/&gt; For more detailed erasures, he uses a pencil-shaped [[white eraser]], and to erase large areas, he uses a larger, hand-held white eraser, the Staedtler Mars plastic, which he calls a "thermonuclear eraser", because it "takes care of everything".&lt;ref name=YouTubePart3/&gt;

;Joe Quesada
Artist and former Marvel Comics editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] begins with sketches much smaller than the actual size at which he will render the final drawing. He employs a Cintiq [[drawing tablet]] when he desires to do a "tighter" digital layout of an illustration. When sketching figures, he will sometimes use photographic reference, and incorporate the photos directly into his sketches during the process of finalizing a layout. Once he makes a final decision on a layout, he will then print it out at full size, and use a light box to pencil it, sometimes altering elements in the design such as lighting or other details.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quesada, Joe]].

Artist [[Bryan Hitch]] begins with multiple rough sketches employing different camera angles on paper with a blue pencil, which traditionally does not photocopy or scan, and then select the desired elements from the rough sketch with a graphite pencil. After picking the initial shapes, he will further emphasize his selections with a red marker pen and other colored pens, continuing to attempt different variations. He will then, depending on how late in the day it is, either redraw the illustration on a sheet of layout paper or use his lightbox to tighten and clean up the drawing, emphasizing that the lightbox should not be a mere exercise in tracing, but an opportunity to refine or change elements in the drawing to make it "clean" enough to be inked. When Hitch transfers the drawing to the final art board, he does initial layouts with a 2H pencil, which he feels provides the necessary accuracy and detail, and uses an erasable blue pencil to mark panel frames and [[vanishing point]]s, which he introduces after the rough stage. He chooses not to put too much time or polish into this stage, preferring to work quickly, lightly and instinctively. He uses a mechanical pencil with 0.9mm 2H lead at this stage for fine outlines and detail work, and a traditional pencil for more organic work, including softer lines, shading large areas and creating more fluid motion. The "best tool of all", according to him, is a traditional pencil cut with a [[craft knife]], which he says can produce a variety of marks, and be used for detail, shading and general sketching. Hitch believes the best results combine both the mechanical and the knife-sharpened traditional pencil. Hitch is particular about his studio workspace, which does not contain a TV or sofa, stating that such things belong in the lounge for relaxation. Despite using a professional drawing board, he emphasizes that any inexpensive board large enough to hold the paper is sufficient, as he himself mostly uses a piece of roughly cut [[chip-board]] leaning on the edge of his desk. He uses an [[Apple iMac]] desktop computer, [[flatbed scanner]] and [[Photoshop]] to modify his artwork digitally.&lt;ref name=BHUCStudio&gt;[[Hitch, Bryan]]. ''Bryan Hitch's Ultimate Comics Studio'', Impact Books, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

;Simone Bianchi
In contrast to Hitch's work environment, artist [[Simone Bianchi (artist)|Simone Bianchi]] says that he cannot work unless he is listening to music, and has an extensive music collection in his studio, and stereo speakers placed above his drawing board. Bianchi uses extensive photo reference and a lightbox to give his artwork a realistic look. He uses a wooden drawing board that he used to draw on flat, but angled it due to back pain that he began having in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Weiland, Jonah (January 10, 2007).

;Marc Silvestri
Another artist who listens to music while working is [[Marc Silvestri]], who says that he listens to [[down-tempo chill music]] while working, in contrast to the [[alternative rock]] he listens to at other times.&lt;ref name=ThirdDegree&gt;"The Third Degree: Marc Silvestri". ''Point of Impact''. Image Comics. October 2012. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Erik Larsen
On the Biography &amp; Bibliography page of his website, [[Erik Larsen]] explains that he uses a Staedtler Mars Lumograph 100 2H pencil, and a Staedtler Mars Plastic Eraser.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Erik. [http://www.savagedragon.com/eriklarsen.htm "Erik Larsen - Biography &amp; Bibliography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526004822/http://www.savagedragon.com/eriklarsen.htm |date=2011-05-26 }}. [[Savage Dragon]].com. Retrieved February 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the site's Frequently Asked Questions page, he states that he uses a standard Dixon Ticonderoga #2 pencil with HB lead, explaining, "It's mushy as all hell but it doesn't slow me down like a harder pencil would."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savagedragon.com/faq.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=SavageDragon.com|author=Larsen, Erik|accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Amanda Conner
While reading each page of a script, artist [[Amanda Conner]] does tiny thumbnail sketches with stick figures corresponding to the story indicated on each page, in order to help her design the page's layout. She then does tighter, more elaborate sketches, though still fairly small compared with the finished artwork,&lt;ref name=CreatingComics&gt;Salavetz, Judith; Drate, Spencer. ''Creating Comics!'', 2010, Rockport Publishers, pp, 34 and 35&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 4" x 6",&lt;ref name=CreatorOwnedHeroes&gt;''Creator-Owned Heroes'' #5 [[Image Comics]]. October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and then blows those up on a [[photocopier]] to the proper original comic art size, which is 10&amp;nbsp;inches x 15&amp;nbsp;inches. She then uses "very tight pencils" to [[light-box]] it onto [[Bristol board]], if she intends to have it inked by her husband and collaborator, Jimmy Palmiotti, but will do the pencils "lighter and looser" if she intends to ink it herself, as she already knows how she wants the artwork rendered.&lt;ref name=CreatingComics/&gt; Conner has created her own paper stock and blue line format on her drawing paper, because, she explains, she likes having those configurations pre-printed on the page, and feels that "sometimes the rough is too toothy and the smooth is too slick." The stock she uses is the 10" x 15" Strathmore 500 series, but she also orders a custom 8" x 12" stock because she sometimes finds those dimensions more comfortable and easier to work on more quickly. She also finds the Strathmore 300 series "pretty good" likes its nice texture and greater affordability, but says that must occasionally content with getting a "bleedy batch". Conner uses mechanical pencils with .03 lead because she found it easier to use than regular pencils that require her to stop and sharpen them frequently.&lt;ref name=CreatorOwnedHeroes/&gt;

;Gene Ha
Once artist [[Gene Ha]] obtains a script, he makes "tiny" thumbnail sketches of each page, and then makes layout sketches on shrunked copies of comic art board, two per page. It is at this stage that he works out the light/dark balance of the page. Though he says about 90% of his artwork are done without photo reference, he will sometimes photograph his friends pose as the central characters, or use a full length mirror to draw himself. He renders minor characters from his imagination. Irrespective of how much sunlight he has on a given day, he prefers to use a 500W incandescent photo lamp, though he believes a 500W halogen lamp is also adequate. He prefers to use a [[lead holder]] with [[H lead]] for sketching, and [[2B lead]] for shading, which he sharpens with a rotary lead pointer, believing that such leads can be sharpened better than a traditional pencil. He blows up a scan of each page layout to 8.5" x 11", and draws "tight" pencils on top of these, which are then scanned and printed on 11" x 17" [[inkjet paper]] in faint [[Non-photo blue|blue line]]. He prefers [[Xerox]] paper because he feels that the surface of marker paper tends to get smudgy or oily. When importing art to modify in his computer, he uses [[Photoshop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geneha.com/faq.htm "Questions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215112348/http://www.geneha.com/faq.htm |date=2013-12-15 }}.

;Jason Shiga
Artist [[Jason Shiga]] penciled his 2011 graphic novel ''Empire State: A Love Story (Or Not)'' with a yellow [[No. 2 pencil]] on copy paper, before transferring it with brushed ink via a lightbox.&lt;ref name=EmpireState&gt;Shiga, Jason.

;Jonathan Luna
Artist Jonathan Luna uses 14 x 17 Strathmore Bristol board, which he cuts into 11 x 17 pieces on which to draw. He draws using a 2H pencil, and after inking his pencils with a [[Micron pen]], he edits his line work on a graphics tablet.&lt;ref name=YouTube&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Hm-0TbvxM Interview with the Luna Brothers at] [[Midtown Comics]]; [[YouTube]]; May 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

;Marcio Takara
Artist [[Marcio Takara]] begins his pages with 7" x 5" ink thumbnail sketches with which he shows his overall ideas to his editor. When he begins the actual pencils, he keeps them "loose", because he will eventually ink over them himself, and does not require greater specificity. The penciling stage is the fastest stage for Takara, who does all of his pencil work with an [[HB pencil|HB 0.5]] mechanical pencil, completing two or three penciled pages a day, sometimes even inking all three by the end of the day.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Incredibles: Family Matters]]'' trade paperback. (July 2009) [[BOOM! Studios]].&lt;/ref&gt;

;Chuck Austen
Writer/artist [[Chuck Austen]] did his work on ''[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]'' entirely on a computer. He prefers uses mostly Macintoshes, but also uses [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]s. When using a Mac, he uses ''[[Ray Dream Studio]]'', and when using a PC, usings ''[[3D Studio Max]]''. These allow him to take three-dimensional models and break them down into simplified two-tone line forms. He purchases the models from catalogues, or uses ones that he built for ''Strips'' using in ''Hash'' or ''[[Animation:Master]]''. After importing the models into ''Studio'' or ''Max'', he arranges the angles and other aspects of the scene before rendering them, such as placement of background objects or modifying gestures, while the computer corrects elements such as [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], [[foreshortening]], proportions, etc. After the files are rendered to Austen's satisfaction, he assembles them into page form using [[Photoshop]], completing details that the modeling programs cannot perfect, such as facial expressions, hair, filling in blacks, rendering clothes and wrinkles, etc. To finish the art, he will either print out the "pencils" directly onto Bristol board and finalize them with an HB Tombow pencil and ink them with a #2 nib, or will apply the finishes in Photoshop.&lt;ref name=CBRWarMachine&gt;Giles, Keith (September 6, 2011).

;Scott McCloud
[[Scott McCloud]] also does his work almost entirely on a [[computer tablet]]. Although he sketches his layouts in pencil, the remainder of his work is done digitally, explaining in his 2006 book ''[[Making Comics]]'' that he had not used traditional materials like Bristol board, pens or brushes in years. After sketching layouts, which he says are "pretty tight", and include the full script, he scans them into an 18-inch tablet/monitor to use them as a guide for lettering them in [[Adobe Illustrator]]. After completing the lettering, he exports the files to Photoshop, where he fully renders the art at a resolution of 1,200 [[Dots per inch|dpi]], creating between five and fifty layers of finished art before flattening it into a single black and white [[bitmap]], plus a [[greyscale]] page, if needed.&lt;ref&gt;McCloud, Scott (2006), ''Making Comics''. [[William Morrow Paperbacks]]. pp 196-197&lt;/ref&gt;

;Fiona Staples
Another artist who does her work almost entirely digitally is [[Fiona Staples]], who switched to that process several years prior to beginning her work on ''[[Saga (comic book)|Saga]]'', though her process for that series is different from previous ones, for which she characterizes it as "one intense, ongoing experiment." She begins with thumbnails, roughly drawn on printed paper templates. During this stage Staples does not use reference, but does so later in the inking stage. During the thumbnail stage, she gives copious thought to the layouts and staging, making it, in her words, the most important part of the process. After scanning the thumbnails, she enlarges them and uses them as rudimentary pencils, and "inks" over them in [[Manga Studio]], and later colors the art in Photoshop. One of the advantages Staples sees in working digitally is the ability to dispense with tight pencils in favor of making corrections in an ad hoc manner, as she finds penciling in great detail and drawing such art a second time in ink to be boring.&lt;ref name="Saga#8"&gt;{{cite comic|title=[[Saga (comic book)|Saga]]|issue=8|story=Fiona's Process|publisher=Image Comics|writer=Staples, Fiona|artist=Staples, Fiona|date=December 2012|page=24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Chris Samnee
Artist [[Chris Samnee]] Samnee uses 300 series two-ply Strathmore Bristol board. He does not use non-photo blue pencils or any other equipment purchased at specialty stores for preliminary sketching, but uses .9&amp;nbsp;mm mechanical pencils that he purchases from [[Target Corporation|Target]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comic-con.org/toucan/chris-samnee-devil-details-part-2 "Chris Samnee: The Devil is in the Details, Part 2"]. Toucan: The Official Blog. June 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his pencils as "just awful", and inks them himself, as he cannot envision giving them to someone else to ink.&lt;ref name=Toucan&gt;[http://www.comic-con.org/toucan/chris-samnee-devil-details-part-1 "Chris Samnee: The Devil is in the Details, Part 1"]. Toucan Blog. May 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
Some artists use a '''loose pencilling''' approach, in which the penciller does not take much care to reduce the vagaries of the pencil art, leaving it to the inker to interpret the penciller's intent. In those cases, the penciller is usually credited with "'''breakdowns'''" or "'''layouts'''" and the inker is credited as the "embellisher" or "finisher".&lt;ref&gt;"Bullpen Bulletins", ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #52 (Marvel Comics, June 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Other pencillers prefer to create detailed pages, where every nuance that they expect to see in the inked art is indicated in pencil. This is known as '''tight pencilling'''.

== Workflow ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
A comic book penciller usually works closely with the comic book's [[editing|editor]], who commissions a script from the [[writer]] and sends it to the penciller.

Comic book scripts can take a variety of forms. Some writers, such as [[Alan Moore]], produce complete, elaborate, and lengthy outlines of each page. Others send the artist only a plot outline consisting of no more than a short overview of key scenes with little or no dialogue. [[Stan Lee]], was known to prefer this latter form, and thus it came to be known as the [[Marvel Method]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Evanier|Evanier, Mark]]. ''Kirby: King of Comics'' ([[Harry N. Abrams]], New York, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a writer or another artist (such as an [[art director]]) will include basic layouts, called "[[script breakdown|breakdown]]s," to assist the penciller in scene composition. If no breakdowns are included, then it falls to the penciller to determine the layout of each page, including the number of panels, their shapes and their positions. Even when these visual details are indicated by a script, a penciller may feel when drawing the scene that there is a different way of composing the scene, and may disregard the script, usually following consultation with the editor and/or writer.

[[File:Mettay-Diane.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Selene]] and [[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]]]]
'''Pierre-Charles Le Mettay''' (19 July 1726, [[Fécamp]] - 29 March 1759, [[Paris]]) was a French painter, primarily of mythological scenes, and designer. His last name has several spelling variations and his first name is sometimes given as '''Pierre-Joseph'''.

==Biography==
He was the son of a goldsmith. His mother died five days after his baptism. When he came of age, he was apprenticed to an engineer in [[Sercus]], but soon realized that he was not learning the skills that matched his aspirations. Aged barely sixteen, he managed to find a position in the studios of [[François Boucher]].&lt;ref name="H"&gt;Jules Hédou, ''P. C. Le Mettay, peintre du roi, 1726-1759'', Henry Boissel, 1881 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HCYtAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jules+H%C3%A9dou+P.+C.+Le+Mettay,+peintre+du+roi&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qz9cVMHCJ4jZsAS2u4I4&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jules%20H%C3%A9dou%20P.%20C.%20Le%20Mettay%2C%20peintre%20du%20roi&amp;f=false Complete text] @ Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; Within five years, he was ready to compete with other artists at the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] and was awarded the [[Prix de Rome]] for painting in 1747.

When he arrived at the [[French Academy in Rome]], he spent much of his time doing religious painting rather than following the school's curriculum. In 1751, nevertheless, the new Director, [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]], chose him as one of four students who would do paintings for the General Directorate of Naples, despite opposition from the [[Abel-François Poisson de Vandières|Marquis de Marigny]] who felt that Mettay had no talent and had ignored his studies too much.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; He went to Naples in 1753, followed by a trip through the main [[Adriatic]] ports. He remained in [[Turin]] long enough to be presented at court and receive several commissions. In 1756, he returned to Paris.
[[File:Mettay-Venus.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Venus Bathing]]
With some assistance from Boucher, he created paintings from sketches of Greece, made by the architect [[Julien-David Le Roy]] on his recent visit there, then did the same for a set of engravings by [[Jacques-Philippe Le Bas]], which were issued in two [[folio]]s. On the basis of this work, he presented himself for membership in the royal academy and was accepted as a candidate in 1757.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; Shortly after, he began to exhibit at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] and received great praise from the ''[[Mercure de France]]''.

He became a full member of the academy in 1759, but died only twenty-six days later. His health had always been fragile and he may have succumbed to overwork.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt;

Many of his works were widely distributed after being made into engavings by {{ill|Jean-Charles Le Vasseur|fr}}, {{ill|Louis-Simon Lempereur|fr}} and [[Adrian Zingg]]. Most of the drawings he made in Italy were sold to the Ribards; a well known merchant family in [[Rouen]]. Some eventually found their way into the possession of [[Jean-Baptiste Descamps]], the founder of the "École de dessin de Rouen".

[[File:Priscilla_Horton_(Mrs._German_Reed)_as_Ariel.jpg|right|thumb|Horton as Ariel in ''[[The Tempest]]'', 1838]]'''Priscilla Horton''', later '''Priscilla German Reed''' (2 January 1818 – 18 March 1895), was a popular English singer and actress, known for her role as Ariel in [[W. C. Macready]]'s production of ''[[The Tempest]]'' in 1838 and "fairy" [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] at Covent Garden Theatre.  Later, she was known, along with her husband, [[Thomas German Reed]], for creating the family-friendly [[German Reed Entertainments]].  There, she was a mentor to [[W. S. Gilbert]], and her performances inspired Gilbert to create some of his famous contralto roles.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Horton was born in [[Birmingham]].  Her parents were Thomas Horton and Barbara, ''née'' Westwater.  She performed on the stage in London from the age of ten, when she played the Gipsy Girl in ''[[Guy Mannering]]'' at the [[Surrey Theatre]].&lt;ref name=Thomasdnb&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23278 "Reed, (Thomas) German (1817–1888)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 13 November 2008 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Horton sang at [[Vauxhall Gardens]].  In 1830, she appeared at Covent Garden Theatre as Mealey Mouth in ''Harlequin, Pat, and Bat''.  In 1834, at the [[Old Vic|Royal Victorian Theatre]], Horton played Julia in a musical adaptation of ''Guy Mannering'', Kate in [[Sheridan Knowles]]'s [[melodrama]] ''The Beggar's Daughter of Bethnal Green'', Romeo, Desdemona in ''[[Othello]]'', and Oscar in ''Gustavus the Third''.&lt;ref name=Thomasdnb/&gt; In 1837, she joined in [[W. C. Macready]]'s company at [[Covent Garden Theatre]].  There she played Mopsa in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', the Boy in ''Henry V'', and the Fool in ''[[King Lear]]''.  After other successful roles, Horton played Ariel in Macready's production of ''[[The Tempest]]'' in 1838 at Covent Garden.&lt;ref name=DNB395&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Reed, Thomas German|volume=47|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Priscilla-horton.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Drawing of Priscilla German Reed in both the parts she played in an 1857 double bill: the title roles in ''The Flower-boy'' and ''The Scotch Fisher-girl"]]
Blonde and blue eyed, Horton had sometimes played in "[[trouser role]]s", which, by the time Horton entered the profession, had lost much of their risqué aura.  She was a favourite of [[James Planché]], [[Charles Dickens]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r4gspvfPug0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA1825 Example of a poem and drawing by Charles Dickens for Horton]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] and was known for her agile dancing and clear [[contralto]] singing voice.  The historian Paul Buczkowski wrote of her, "Horton brought a lively intelligence to her roles, and was almost as highly lauded in tragedy (for instance, as Ophelia in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and the Fool in ''King Lear'') as in comedy.  She would appear in most of Planché's later works, substantially enriching them."&lt;ref&gt;Buczkowski, Paul.  [http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/marvels_and_tales/v015/15.1buczkowski.pdf "J. R. Planché, Frederick Robson, and the Fairy Extravaganza",] ''Marvels &amp; Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (2001), pp. 42–65&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1840 to 1847, Horton joined [[Benjamin Nottingham Webster]]'s company at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], where she first played Ophelia in 1840.  ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' wrote: "The only striking novelty in the performance is the Ophelia of Miss P. Horton, which approaches very nearly to the wild pathos of the original in one scene, and is touching and beautiful in all."&lt;ref&gt;''The Athenaeum'', 21 March 1840, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  The same year, she created the role of Georgina Vesey in [[Lord Lytton]]'s ''Money''.  In 1842, she sang the role of Acis in [[Handel]]'s ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]''.&lt;ref name=Thomasdnb/&gt; At the Haymarket Theatre from 1843–47, she appeared in many of her Planché Christmas and Easter pieces.  During these years, she also appeared at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] as Philidel in [[Henry Purcell]]'s opera ''[[King Arthur (opera)|King Arthur]]'' (1842) and created the girl/boy roles of Myrtina/Fortunio in Planché's ''Fortunio and his Seven Gifted Servants'' (1843).

===Marriage and later years===
She married [[Thomas German Reed]] in 1844.  From 1847–54, she continued to play roles at the Haymarket, Drury Lane and [[Olympic Theatre|Olympic]] theatres as well as in provincial tours.  One 1851 role was Hecate in Macready's farewell ''[[Macbeth]]''.&lt;ref name=DNB395/&gt;

[[File:PGReed.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Priscilla German Reed, mid-1860s]]
In the spring of 1855, the German Reeds presented the first performance of "[[German Reed Entertainment|Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings]]," musical theatre performances usually consisting of one or two brief [[comic opera]]s designed for a minimal number of characters and performed with either the piano and [[Pump organ|harmonium]] or a small ensemble of musicians.  These soon became "Mr. And Mrs. German Reed's Entertainments", presented at the [[Royal Gallery of Illustration]] in [[Regent Street]] (and later at [[St. George's Hall (London)|St. George's Hall]]).  To help lend respectability to their family-friendly entertainments, they called their establishment the "Gallery" of Illustration, rather than a "theatre", and the pieces they put on were called "entertainments," rather than plays, extravaganzas, or burlesques, to interest family audiences who were afraid of the bad reputation in which the professional theatre was regarded at the time.

The entertainments focused on satire and "clean" comedy, eschewing any hint of the vulgarity that permeated the London stage.  Reed himself composed the music for many of these pieces, and often appeared in them, together with Mrs. German Reed.  Horton was a mentor to the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], who wrote six short operas for the German Reeds, each with a prominent role for Horton, and these roles became the pattern for his later contralto characters in the [[Savoy Operas]].

Thomas retired in 1871, and Horton, together with their son, Alfred (1847–1895), continued the entertainments until her retirement in 1879, when Alfred took over their production until 1895.  She retired from performing in 1879.  She died at the age of 77 at [[Bexley Heath]], Kent.

'''Purple''' is a [[France|French]] fashion, art and culture magazine founded in 1992.

==History==
In 1992, Elein Fleiss and [[Olivier Zahm]] started the magazine ''Purple Prose'' as a reaction against the superficial glamour of the [[1980s in fashion|1980s]]; much as a part of the global counterculture at the time, inspired by magazines like ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]],'' ''[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Ray Gun]],'' ''Nova'', and ''Helmut Newton's Illustrated'', but with the aesthetics of what usually is referred to as [[History of fashion design#1990s|anti-fashion]]. Based on their personal interests and views; ''Purple'' was, and in a sense still is, made much in the same spirit of the [[fanzine]]. The magazine became associated with the "realism" of the new fashion photography of the 1990s, with names like [[Juergen Teller]], [[Terry Richardson]], [[Wolfgang Tillmans]], and [[Mario Sorrenti]].&lt;ref&gt;Zahm, Olivier; Purple Anthology 1992/2006; Purple Fashion, Fall Winter 2008/09; Purple Institute, Paris 2008; p.68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction of the ''Purple Anthology'', Zahm writes:
{{cquote|[...] We launched Purple Prose in the early 1990s without any means, and without any experience, because we wanted to make a magazine that was radically different. We wanted to support the artists around us that noone else supported, much less talked about. [..] It would be a form of opposition of our own, different from the critical jargon of the generation of '68. [..] From a visual standpoint, we represented the break from '80s imagery (like Richard Avedon's photography for Versace, for example). From an artistic standpoint, the artists of the early '90s were rising up against art as capital fetish [..]. In saying that Purple is the portrait of a generation, I mean it's a portrait of those who embody their times. At the same time, it's a portrait of myself and Elein Fleiss, our ideas, our lives, and our aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Zahm, Olivier and Fleiss, Elein; ''Purple Anthology: Art Prose Fashion Music Architecture Sex''; Rizzoli 2008; {{ISBN|0-8478-3020-9}} {{ISBN|9780847830206}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2004 it  divided into '''''Purple Fashion''''' published by Purple Institute based in Paris and New York, and '''''Purple Journal''''', published by Les Editions Purple, based in Paris. On February 16 the first installation of ''Purple Fashion'''s new web site was launched.

The art director of Purple Prose and ''Purple Fashion'' was [[Christophe Brunnquell]] until 2006, when he was succeeded by [[M/M Paris]].

===Offspring publications===
Fleiss and Zahm's collaboration has resulted in many side projects:

*Purple Prose – published from October 1992 to winter 1998 (13 issues).
*''Purple Fiction'' – a literary magazine published between 1995 and 1998 (4 issues).
*''Purple Fashion'' – published between 1995 - 1998 (4 issues), and 2004 - (present).
*''Purple Sexe'' – a magazine devoted to sexuality, published between winter 1998 and 2001 (8 issues). The magazine was reborn as a one-off appendix for Purple Fashion Fall/Winter 2008/09, dedicated to Italian porn star [[Rocco Siffredi]].
*''Purple'' – a fusion of Purple Prose, Fiction, Fashion, and Sexe; published between summer 1998 and 2003 (16 issues).
*Purple Books – a publishing house (1998–2001)

*''Purple Journal'' – a cultural magazine published 2004 - (present) in a French and an English version.

'''Sheila Crossley''' (also '''Birtles''') is a [[fictional character]] from the British soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]''. She was portrayed by actress Eileen Mayers. The character is famous for her suicide plot which was ultimately axed.

==Casting==
Mayers left the series in 1967 and was asked to return for two episodes in 1969, as part of [[Elsie Tanner]]'s ([[Pat Phoenix]]). In 1974, the actress returned to filming for another stint as Sheila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Off the Street where they live|journal=[[TVTimes]]|date=21–27 September 1974|volume=76|issue=39|pages=49|publisher=Independent Television Publications Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
Through his many faults, Sheila fell hard for [[Neil Crossley (Coronation Street)|Neil Crossley]] ([[Geoffrey Matthews]]), so much so that she did not see how badly he treated her. Neil only thought of Sheila as a bit of fun and after he stood her up on a date, she confronted him. Angered, Neil hit Sheila and left, leaving her devastated and she sank into a deep depression. She pushed her friends away and lost her job for not turning up. After she and Neil met again and he told her in no uncertain terms that they were over, Sheila attempted suicide but was found by [[Dennis Tanner]] ([[Philip Lowrie]]). On the doctor's recommendation, Sheila left Weatherfield and moved in with her parents. Whilst there, Sheila discovered she was pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy in 1964, who she named Danny, before giving him up for adoption.

In 1966, Sheila was set up on a blind date by a friend and was shocked to find her date was [[Jerry Booth (Coronation Street)|Jerry Booth]] ([[Graham Haberfield]]), who she went on an unsuccessful date with years ago. Sheila and Jerry reconnected and Sheila returned to Weatherfield and moved in with [[Elsie Tanner]]'s ([[Pat Phoenix]]), securing a job at the new factory. Sheila and Jerry quickly fell in love and intended to marry but when Sheila bumped into Neil later that year, her feelings for him came rushing back and Neil proposed. Jerry was heartbroken when Sheila left with Neil.

==Reception==
After learning that Sheila's character was to commit suicide in 1963, the public was outraged. Instead, it was re-written and viewers saw the character take pills before the screen faded to black. Actress Eileen Mayers has claimed that "It was disappointing, it was good and it wasn't shown", referring to the suicide scenes. However, in 2011, the scenes were shown in the documentary ''The Corrie Years''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/tv/2011/07/18/first-look-at-coronation-street-suicide-scenes-to-be-shown-in-documentary-the-corrie-years-115875-23278251/|title=First look at Coronation Street suicide scenes to be shown in documentary The Corrie Years|last=Jefferies|first=Mark|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|date=18 July 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the announcement that the scenes were to air 50 years later, a ''Coronation Street'' insider told the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' that "At the time it was deemed too controversial. But compared to what goes on in soaps these days, I don't think the scene will be very shocking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/tv/2011/06/24/axed-coronation-street-suicide-scene-to-be-shown-115875-23222830/|title=Axed Coronation Street suicide scene to be shown|last=Jefferies|first=Mark|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|date=24 June 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's suicide plot has been compared to that of [[Natasha Blakeman]]'s in 2010 in the soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/867385-axed-coronation-street-scene-to-air-50-years-after-being-filmed|title=Axed Coronation Street scene to air 50 years after being filmed|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers Ltd]])|date=24 June 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social design''' is design, that is mindful of the designer’s role and responsibility in society; and the use of the design process to bring about social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mica.edu/Programs_of_Study/Graduate_Programs/Social_Design_(MA)/Overview.html|title=Overview {{!}} MICA|last=Art|first=Maryland Institute College of|website=www.mica.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social design is also a critical discipline that challenges the pure market-orientedness of conventional design practice, and attempts to see past, into a more inclusive conception of design, in which user groups who are marginalized are also given priority. 

==Responsibility==
Within the design world, social design is sometimes defined as a design process that contributes to improving human well-being and livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda of social design is inspired by among others' [[Victor Papanek]]’s idea that designers and creative professionals have a [[Social responsibility|responsibility]] and are able to cause real change in the world through good design. Papanek writes about responsible design. Designers can contribute to designing more [[ecological]] products by carefully selecting the materials they use. Papanek also remarks on designing for people's needs rather than their wants. Responsible design includes many directions and one of these is design for the [[Third World]]. Designers have responsibility over the choices they make in design processes.&lt;ref&gt;Papanek, Victor (1984): Design for the Real World. Academy Chicago Publishers. Completely Revised Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Social design thinking within the design world joins developing human and [[social capital]] with new products and processes that are [[Profit (economics)|profitable]]. Profitability and [[ownership]] of the processes are the cornerstones of [[sustainability]] that underpins human well-being{{according to whom|date=January 2017}}. Another author that contributes to the development of this definition of social design is [[Victor Margolin]]. He writes in "''The Politics of the Artificial''" about the "designer's ability to envision and give form on material and immaterial products that can address human problems on broad scale and contribute to social well-being." This [[ideology]] is something that social design is built on.&lt;ref&gt;Margolin, Victor (2002): The Politics of the Artificial. Essays on Design and Design Studies. The University of Chicago Press. Chicago and London&lt;/ref&gt; In this view social design is an activity that should not be framed with connotations of charity, aid donations, help etc. It is not voluntary work, but it should be seen as professional contribution that plays a part in local [[economic development]] or livelihood. At the same time Social Design also challenges the conventional market model of designing. While traditionally, Design has been approached as a profession that remains strictly answerable to market forces, Social design envisages the possibility of a more distributive conception of surpluses, by ensuring that the benefits of services and systems reach a wider range of user groups who may often fall outside the market system.

==Strategic thinking==
Another starting point for outlining social design is [[strategic thinking]] of design. Creating policies and implementing them on a civil level. The two poles: tradition and the market economy can, in one of the models for social design, be placed in [[interaction]], rather than in competition, with each other. An author that has to be mentioned here is [[Jacque Fresco]] and his Venus Project. He proposes that the future of the social systems needs to be designed by the [http://plaesturb.org/index.php?title=P%C3%A1gina_Principal scientific method]. Social design can then be seen as a process that leads to human capabilities that in turn contributes to their well-being. As [[Amartya Sen]] writes, [[poverty]] is seen as deprivation of capabilities. By focusing on capabilities, rather than e.g. income, Amartya Sen suggests that development within various social aspects of life can contribute to general development. Understanding and using social design processes can contribute to the improvement of livelihood&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Amartya (2000): Development as Freedom. Anchor Books. New York&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance design==

{{importance section|date=January 2017}}

As social media becomes integrated with live performance, social design has become a term to describe someone who designs how online tools connect to a performance. Just as there are lighting designers, sound designers, set designers, costume designers and video designers - social designers work with a team to complement a production with social media tools and content.  In this context, social design is defined as: "The strategic implementation of social media to deepen or broaden the nature of an artistic performance."

==Designing systems==
Another dimension of social design focuses on designing systems that join the elements of [[communication]], [[new product development]] and the [[Social environment|environment]]. It is argued that no single area of design is, by itself, sufficient to drive sustainable social development. What is needed is a system of design, one that encompasses all of the areas of design, towards an open system with multiple, self-adjusting and complementary actors that aim for a vision of a loosely defined common set of goals.

Outside the design world social design appears in a number of professional environments. There are a growing number of artists, especially in Scandinavia, that use the term social design to describe their work, though the work is exhibited within the art world. These are artist like FOS and [[Superflex]]. They come out of a tradition of social art that can be led back to the Futurists, the Dadaists and e.g. the German artist [[Joseph Beuys]]. In the realm of practice, however, Social design can be rooted more specifically in developing world contexts, within unequal spaces, where design is not merely an attempt at serving the few, but many simultaneously. This approach is particularly taken in the MDes Program in Social Design in Ambedkar University, Delhi, India. 

==Social world==
The term social design is also increasingly used to describe design of the social world. This definition implicates a perception of a man-made reality, which consequently can only be changed by humans, and ''is'' changed by humans all the time. In this view social design is inescapable, it is there whether people are aware of it or not. The social reality is created as a result of the sum of all our individual actions. There is an emerging discussion of this concept of social design, which encompasses all other definitions of the term.

The '''Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz''' (''State Theatre at Gärtnerplatz''), commonly called the '''Gärtnerplatztheater''', is an [[opera house]] and [[opera]] company in [[Munich]]. (The "Gärtnerplatz" is an urban square in the borough [[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]].) Designed by Michael Reiffenstuel, it opened on 4 November 1865 as the city's second major theatre after the [[National Theatre Munich|National Theatre]].

At times exclusively concerned with [[operetta]], in recent years there have also been productions of opera, musicals and ballet. The scope of activities is similar to that of the [[Komische Oper]] in Berlin and the [[English National Opera]] in London.

One of the most active theatres in [[Germany]], its season lasts from September to July and comprises more than 200 performances.  The current [[intendant]] is Josef Ernst Köpplinger.

== History ==
In 1863, a committee for the founding of a ''Volkstheater'' (people's theatre) formed. [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] authorized a new building in the borough Isarvorstadt on 10 May 1864. It was designed by [[Franz Michael Reiffenstuel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordostkultur-muenchen.de/biographien/reiffenstruel.htm Die Reiffenstuels]&lt;/ref&gt; who modelled it after the [[Nationaltheater München|Nationaltheater]] in [[Classicist architecture|classicist style]].{{sfn|Munich|2018}}{{sfn|Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz|1965|p=43}} The groundbreaking was on 25 August 1864, and the ''Richtfest'' was celebrated on 27 May 1865.{{sfn|Busse|1924|pp=13–15}} The house was opened on 4 November 1865,{{sfn|Hußlein|2015}} with [[Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria]] representing the king. The opening performance was a Prologue followed by an allegorical festive play (''Festspiel'') by Hermann Schmid, ''Was wir wollen'' (What we want), with music by {{ill|Georg Kremplsetzer|de}}“.{{sfn|Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz|1965|p=12}}

The house, intended to show a different repertory than the court theatre,{{sfn|Hußlein|2015}} met with financial problems, under frequently changing directors. It had to be sold in March 1870, went first to the former director Friedrich Engelken, shortly thereafter to the architect and a partner, who bought it for the king, who acquired it officially in May 1870. It was reopened on 1 October 1870, directed by [[Hermann von Schmid]].{{sfn|Busse|1924|pp=19–21}} In 1873, Ludwig II granted it the name "Königliches Theater am Gärtnerplatz" (Royal theatre at the Gärtnerplatz).{{sfn|Munich|2018}} From 1877,  {{ill|Karl von Perfall|de}} directed the house and also the Hoftheater. The 1878/79 season was especially splendid but resulted in a large deficit. Perfall therefore focused on the Hoftheater, and was succeeded by Georg Lang. The theatre dropped the royal emblem and was called "Theater am Gärtnerplatz".{{sfn|Busse|1924|pp=29–30}}

In 1913, the house was rebuilt by {{ill|Eugen Drollinger|de}}, who designed a new approach by the audience to the tiers, and installed more loges.{{sfn|Busse|1924|pp=325}} During World War I, several charity performances were given for the ''Kriegsfonds'' and social organisations.{{sfn|Busse|1924|p=44}} In 1923, the house was acquired by the {{ill|Wittelsbacher Ausgleichsfonds|de}}.

When the theatre was built, the focus was on [[operetta]], then a new genre.{{sfn|Hußlein|2015}} [[Singspiel]]e, light operas with spoken dialogue in German, were also performed. When the house opened as a royal theatre, [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s ''Salon Pitzelberger'' was played, titled ''Eine musikalische Soirée in der Vorstadt'' (A musical soiree in the suburb). Some operettas received their world premiere, including [[Carl Zeller]]'s ''Die Fornarina'' on 18 October 1979, starring {{ill|Amalie Schönchen|de}}, Agnes Lang-Ratthey, {{ill|Franz Josef Brakl|de}}} and Max Hofpauer. At the end of 1892, a ''Völkerschau'' (People's Show), ''Die Amazonen von Dahomey'', appeared with people from Africa for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=So rassistisch waren die Völkerschauen in München|periodical=|publisher=www.sueddeutsche.de|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/grosser-andrang-abschied-von-cula-1.3746431|accessdate=2017-11-13|last=Marco Wedig|date=2017-11-12|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gärtnerplatzthea.jpg|thumb|The theatre c. 1900]]
From 1899, the theatre played mainly operettas and was regarded as one of the leading houses for the genre in Germany.{{sfn|Busse|1924|pp=32}} [[Fanny zu Reventlow]] was engaged for a short time. [[Magda Schneider]] appeared at the end of the 1920s, complaining that she had to perform up to 48 times a month for a laughable salary ("für eine lächerliche Gage bis zu achtundvierzig mal im Monat auf der Bühne").&lt;ref&gt;Jürgs 2000, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''Possen'' and ''Volksstücke'' were presented until the 1930s, when the [[Nazi regime]] banned performances by Jewish writers, librettists and composers, and demanded that the theatre serve as a venue exclusively for operettas, as the operetta was an excellent means of familiarizing the ordinary citizen with the theater arts ("ausschließlich zur Aufführungsstätte von Operetten, weil… die Operette ein sehr wesentliches Mittel ist, um den Volksgenossen an die Theaterkunst heranzuführen").&lt;ref&gt;Aktionskreis Gärtnerplatztheater, 1979, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giita.jpg|thumb|Program of ''Gitta'', 1942, with Elisabeth Biebl in the title role]]
In April 1937, the state of Bavaria became owner of the theatre.{{sfn|Munich|2018}} Plans to replace it with a new building were not realised, but the house was restored. The reopening of the only state operetta house in Germany on 20 November 1937 presented ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' by Johann Strauss, with [[Adolf Hitler]] in the audience. From 1938, Fritz Fischer was the [[intendant]] and [[Peter Kreuder]] was the music director. Fischer showed a new style, influenced by Berlin [[revue]]s and filmed operettas, with mass scenes, opulent staging and fast action.&lt;ref&gt;''Bayerisches Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz.'' 1965, p. 26 f.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gitta. Eine Fahrt ins Blaue'', a ''Lustspieloperette'' composed by Bernhard Stimmler and Carl Michalski, premiered on 18 May 1942, presenting the new style. ''[[The Merry Widow|Die lustige Witwe]]'' was also played, the declared favourite operetta of Hitler, who attended the theatre frequently.{{sfn|Jungblut|2017}}

On 21 April 1945, the theatre was badly damaged by the last bombing of Munich.{{sfn|Munich|2018}} Shortly after the war, performances were held at a Schornstraße location, and the restored theatre was reopened{{sfn|Munich|2018}} on 19 June 1948, playing ''[[Eine Nacht in Venedig]]'' by Johann Strauss. The Gärtnerplatztheater was able to secure [[Gustaf Gründgens]] to stage, as a guest, Offenbach's ''[[Les brigands|Die Banditen]]'' (The Bandits), first performed on 6 July 1949, with Gründgens playing a major role ("mit intellektuell-komödantischer Bravour").{{sfn|Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz|1965|p=30}} The theatre played mainly popular works, including Millöcker's ''[[Der Bettelstudent]]'', Abraham's ''[[Viktoria und ihr Husar]]'', Kálmán's ''[[Die Csárdásfürstin]]'' with [[Sári Barabás]] in the title role, and ''[[Gräfin Mariza]]'', Zeller's ''[[Der Vogelhändler]]'', and Lehár's ''[[Das Land des Lächelns]]'', with {{ill|Elisabeth Biebl|de|Elisabeth Biebl (Schauspielerin)|lt=Elisabeth Biebl}} as Mi and {{ill|Harry Friedauer|de}} as Gustl. The world premiere of Burkhard's ''[[Das Feuerwerk]]'', staged by [[Erik Charell]] on 16 May 1950, was noticed well beyond Munich.

From 1952 to 1955, {{ill|Rudolf Hartmann|de|Rudolf Hartmann (Regisseur)}}, who also directed the [[Bayerische Staatsoper]], led the theatre.{{sfn|Munich|2018}} He initiated the performance of operas, but with the ensemble of the State Opera.{{sfn|Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz|1965|p=32}} From 1955, the theatre was again independent and officially named Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz,{{sfn|Munich|2018}} led by Willy Duvoisin (1955 to 1958), [[Arno Assmann]] (1959 to 1964), {{ill|Kurt Pscherer|de}} (1964 to 1983), {{ill|Hellmuth Matiasek|de}} (1983 to 1996), {{ill|Klaus Schultz|de}} (1996 to 2007), {{ill|Ulrich Peters (director)|de|Ulrich Peters|lt=Ulrich Peters}} (2007 to 2012) and {{ill|Josef Ernst Köpplinger|de}} (since 2012).{{sfn|Munich|2018}} The chief conductor is [[Anthony Bramall]] (since 2017), and the director of dance is Karl Alfred Schreiner (since 2012).{{sfn|Munich|2018}}

[[File:München Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz innen.jpg|thumb|Interior in 2008]]
In 1955, the first musical was performed at the Gärtnerplatz, the German premiere of Harold Rome's ''[[Fanny (musical)|Fanny]]'',{{sfn|Jansen|2012|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Siedhoff|1990}} with {{ill|Christine Görner|de}} and [[Trude Hesterberg]] in leading roles. It was followed a year later by Cole Porter's ''[[Kiss Me, Kate (musical)|Kiss Me, Kate]]'' with [[Johannes Heesters]].{{sfn|Siedhoff|1990}} Loewe's ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' was performed in 1984, staged by [[August Everding]] and with [[Cornelia Froboess]] as Eliza Doolittle.{{sfn|VDOper|2018}} In 1957, the theatre showed the first performance in Munich of Stravinsky's opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]''.{{sfn|Ganz München|2018}} World premieres of operas included {{ill|Paul Engel (composer)|de|Paul Engel|lt=Paul Engel}}'s ''Daniel'' in 1994,{{sfn|Kutsch|Riemens|2004|p=1577}}, [[Avet Terterian]]'s ''Das Beben'' in 2003,{{sfn|Kuhn|2003}} and {{ill|Wilfried Hiller|de}} ''Der Flaschengeist'' in 2014,{{sfn|Braunmüller|2014}} among others.&lt;!-- and Johann Maria Staud. --&gt;

The theatre was closed in 2012 for extensive restoration.{{sfn|Munich|2018}}{{sfn|Jungblut|2017}} It was reopened on 15 October 2017 with a gala performance followed by a new production of ''Die lustige Witwe'' on 19 October.{{sfn|Jungblut|2017}}{{sfn|Tholl|2017}}

The '''Teloglion Fine Arts Foundation'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teloglion.gr/en/teloglion-foundation-of-art/foundation The Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly known in English as '''Teloglion Foundation of Art''';&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070807074747/http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/general/general.en.html General information]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-el|Τελλόγλειο Ίδρυμα Τεχνών}}) was established in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Central Macedonia]], [[Greece]] in 1972. It was named after ''Nestor and Aliki Telloglou'', who donated their [[art collection]] and their entire property to the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]]. Later the University established this foundation in order to house the art collection and make it available to the public.

==Introduction==
The Teloglion Fine Arts Foundation is a [[non-profit organisation]] whose main mission is to familiarize the public with [[art]] and [[culture]] and to support research and studies about art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in.gr/thes/museum/suggest.asp?file=6 A Description of the Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123003642/http://www.in.gr/thes/museum/suggest.asp?file=6 |date=2007-11-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Foundation organizes many [[Academic conference|conference]]s and [[seminar]]s, supporting in this way the cooperation with other similar [[institution]]s in Greece and abroad. Its large collection comes from [[donation]]s of various individuals and contains numerous artworks mainly of Greek artists of the 19th and 20th centuries. Since December 1999, the Foundation has been installed in a modern building at the upper part of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] [[campus]]. The design of this building was the result of an architectural [[competition|contest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/general/general.en.html General information about the Teloglion Fine Arts Foundation from the official site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807074747/http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/general/general.en.html |date=2007-08-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art collection==
Nestor's and Aliki's Telloglou donation is the core of the [[museum]]'s art collection. The main body of the collection includes works of art by important [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Europe]]an artists of the 19th and 20th century ([[drawing]]s, prints, oil on canvas, [[sculpture]]s and so on). It also includes artworks from various [[civilization]]s: [[Hellenistic]], [[Corinth]]ian and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[pottery]], [[statue]]s, especially from the Hellenistic period, samples of [[China|Chinese]] and [[Arabia|Arabic]] art ([[Dishware|dishes]], [[vase]]s, etc.), [[Persia]]n miniatures and a variety of woodreliefs from [[Thailand]].

Later the collection was enriched with various [[donation]]s from artists and art lovers such as Tonis and Ioanna Spiteris, Demetrios Tsamis and many more. Thus today the collection of the Teloglion Fine Arts Foundation possesses artworks from the most important Greek artists of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, such as works from [[Nikolaos_Gyzis|Gyzis]], [[Savidis]], [[Yiannis_Spyropoulos|Spyropoulos]], [[Nikos_Engonopoulos|Engonopoulos]], [[Dimitris_Mytaras|Mytaras]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greece-museums.com/museum/42/ The Foundation's page at www.greece-museums.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040813/http://www.greece-museums.com/museum/42/ |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the collection also includes the monumental work of art "The World of Cyprus" which is permanently exhibited in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/general/collection.en.html The Collection's description at the official site of the Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825065024/http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/general/collection.en.html |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum==
The Teloglion Fine Arts Foundation is housed in a 6,500 square meter building located at the northern side of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] campus. The building is surrounded by a 24,000 square meter forest and its architectural design was the result of an architectural [[competition]] held in 1982. It is thought to be one of the most beautiful and best designed buildings of [[Thessaloniki]].

The exhibition area covers three floors and a total area of 2,500 square meters. It is subdivided into smaller independent areas and a small number of auxiliary rooms. The levels of [[temperature]], relative [[humidity]] and [[light]] inside the exhibition area are closely and constantly monitored through the use of a state-of-the-art system, which controls the environmental conditions in the whole building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/facilities/gallery.en.html Information about the exhibition area at the official site of the Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807080226/http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/facilities/gallery.en.html |date=2007-08-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation also owns a medium-sized amphitheater, which is a fully equipped conventional center, able to host a great variety of cultural and scientific events, such as musical events, seminars, lectures and conferences. The [[amphitheater]] holds 230 seats and is equipped with advanced megaphone installations, a control room and three independent translation booths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/facilities/amphitheater.en.html Information about the amphitheater at the official site of the Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807074729/http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/facilities/amphitheater.en.html |date=2007-08-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
The Teloglion Fine Arts Foundation is a non-profit organization, supervised by the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]]. It is directed by a [[Board of Trustees]], which is composed of University professors from various faculties, such as the Faculty of Philosophy, the Faculty of Law, the Polytechnic Faculty and the Faculty of Health Sciences. Furthermore, the museum employs researchers, curators and a technical support team, whose main objective is to make sure that the Foundation functions properly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/general/structure.en.html The Foundation's organizational structure as described in its official web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807112758/http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/general/structure.en.html |date=2007-08-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3724">'''''The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn''''' ({{lang-ga|'''Macgnímartha Finn'''}}) is a medieval [[Ireland|Irish]] narrative belonging to the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. As its title implies, it recounts the boyhood exploits of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]], the cycle's central figure. The most important manuscript is Laud 610: folio 118Rb-121Va, which is missing the ending; [[Kuno Meyer]] assigned the text to the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;Meyer, "Macgnimartha Find."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and development==
The Laud 610 manuscript was first edited by [[Kuno Meyer]] in 1881 for the [[France|French]] journal ''[[Revue Celtique]]''.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt; The text breaks off while Fionn investigates a ''[[sídhe]]'' or fairy mound, before his trip to Tara. Scholars have pointed out similarities between earlier versions of ''The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn'' and tales of the youth of the [[Ulster Cycle]] hero [[Cúchulainn]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Cúchulainn]]'' and ''[[Tochmarc Emire|The Wooing of Emer]]'', both found within the epic ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'', recount Cúchulainn's earning of a nickname through his feats, his training by a warrior woman ([[Scáthach]]) and his earning of a deadly spear (the [[Gáe Bulg]]).

==Plot==
The story begins with the death of Fionn's father [[Cumhal]], leader of the [[Fianna]], at the hands of [[Goll mac Morna]]. Cumhal's wife [[Muirne]] was pregnant at the time and eventually gave birth to their son, called Demne in his youth. Fearing for his safety, she sends the boy to be raised by Cumhal's sister, the druidess [[Bodhmall]], and her companion [[Liath Luachra]]. The two warrior women raise him and accompany him on several adventures, including one in which he receives his nickname, ''Fionn'' (the fair; the pale). As he grows, his exploits attract increasing attention, and finally his foster mothers send him away for fear that Goll's men will find him. Subsequent episodes depict his service to the king of [[Bantry]], his recovery of Cumhal's treasures by slaying [[Liath Luachra]] (a different character than his caretaker), and his meeting with the aged and dispossessed Fianna who had fought with his father. 

Another famous episode recounts how Fionn inadvertently eats the [[Salmon of Wisdom]], which would grant universal knowledge to whoever consumed it. He had been studying under the poet [[Finn Eces]], who had sought the fish for seven years. Finally he catches it, and has Fionn cook it for him. Fionn burns his thumb on the fish and puts it in his mouth, thereby receiving its gift of wisdom. 

Fionn travels to the capital of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]], which is set aflame each [[Samhain]] by [[Aillén]] the Burner, one of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]]. Goll and the Fianna are powerless to stop it, since Aillén puts everyone to sleep with a magical tune. Fionn inhales poison from his own spear to prevent sleep, and dispatches Aillén. He reveals his identity to the court, and the king grants Fionn his rightful position as leader of the Fianna. Goll steps down, and engages in a truce with his enemy.

The League was founded in 1930 as the "League of New York Theatres and Producers". It was founded by Broadway theatre operators to further common interests, with the main purpose of fighting [[ticket resale|ticket speculation and scalping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.broadwayleague.com/index.php?url_identifier=about-the-league-1| title=About The League| publisher=The Broadway League| accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original purpose of the League described in its charter was to “protect the general public patrons of the theater, owners of theatrical entertainments, operators of theaters and reputable theater ticket brokers against the evils of speculation of theater tickets.”&lt;ref name=Bloom&gt;{{cite book| title=Broadway: its history, people, and places: an encyclopedia| first=Ken| last=Bloom| ISBN=978-0-415-93704-7| publisher=Routledge| date=November 11, 2003| page=288| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYbYyQjHwdsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Broadway:+its+history,+people,+and+places:+an+encyclopedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig1Yuv8-3VAhXF7YMKHYGIDzAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=league&amp;f=false| accessdate=2017-08-23| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League's first successful act was the writing of the Theater Ticket Code of Fair Practice (together with [[Actors' Equity]]) which became a state law in 1940.&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt; These efforts are still relevant today, as ticket resellers in New York State are required to obtain a license from the Department of State and are prohibited from reselling tickets within 500 feet of theatres or box offices.&lt;ref name="6 facts about the league" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ticket Reseller FAQ"&gt;{{cite web| title=FAQ - Ticket Reseller| url=http://www.dos.ny.gov/licensing/ticketresell/ticket_faq.html| website=NYS Department of State| accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years the League expanded its charter several times. In 1938, the League became the official collective bargaining unit representing the theatre owners and producers on Broadway to negotiate labor agreements with unions such as Actors' Equity.&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt;

With the decline of Broadway in the 1980s the League changed its name to the "League of American Theatres and Producers" and began to expand its domain to theatres across the United States.&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt; On December 18, 2007 the League adopted its current name, "The Broadway League". In a press statement announcing the name change, the League explained that its membership is "not limited to theatre owners and producers, but includes Broadway presenters, general managers and other Broadway industry professionals," and the new name "more aptly reflects the composition of the League's membership." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Gans| first=Andrew| url=http://www.playbill.com/article/league-of-american-theatres-and-producers-announces-name-change-com-146262| title=League of American Theatres and Producers Announces Name Change| work=Playbill| accessdate=2017-08-23| date=December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Labor negotiations ==
The Broadway League is a collective bargaining unit representing Broadway producers and theatre owners, and negotiates labor agreements with 14 unions in New York City to set the minimum terms (fees, salaries, work rules, etc.) for hiring union members. Broadway productions are fully unionized, and all employees are members of unions such as [[Actors' Equity Association]] (AEA), [[Stage Directors and Choreographers Society]] (SDC), Local 802 of [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM), and Local One of [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE).&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;{{cite book| last1=Stein| first1=Tobie S.| last2=Bathurst| first2=Jessica| title=Performing Arts Management: A Handbook of Professional Practices| date=September 30, 2008| publisher=Allworth Press| location=New York City| isbn=978-1581156508| pages=373-382| subscription=yes| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frcxAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Performing+Arts+Management:+A+Handbook+of+Professional+Practices&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6x4Lb9O3VAhVKPCYKHVo8CMsQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=broadway%20league&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadway League also works with the [[Dramatists Guild of America]], an organization composed of playwrights, composers, and lyricists, to engage authors for Broadway productions. Even though the Guild is not a union because authors are not employees of producers or theatres, the Guild provides the Approved Production Contract, a contract template for authors to use in negotiations with producers.&lt;ref name=Stein /&gt;

Out of 40 existing Broadway theatres, the collectively bargained agreements the League negotiates with unions only apply to the theatres owned by the [[Shubert Organization]], [[Jujamcyn Theaters]], and the [[Nederlander Organization]]. Theatres owned and operated by not-for-profit organizations such as the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]], [[Lincoln Center Theater]], and [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] are under the jurisdiction of the [[League of Resident Theatres]] which negotiates separate agreements with unions. [[Disney Theatrical Group]], which owns the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]], also negotiates labor agreements independently, as well as a handful of others.&lt;ref name="2007 Strike 2"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Robertson| first1=Campbell| title=Broadway Strike Will Halt All but Eight Shows| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/theater/10broadway.html| accessdate=13 May 2015| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=10 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2007 Strike 1"&gt;{{cite news| title=Broadway Stagehands Look Close to Striking| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/theater/09broadway.html| accessdate=13 May 2015| work=The New York Times| date=9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Broadway stagehand strike in 2007 ===
{{main|2007 Broadway Stagehand Strike}}

The most recent strike on Broadway occurred in November 2007, when the Broadway League and the stagehands union, Local One of IATSE, failed to come to agreement after months of negotiation. Local One was joined by other Broadway unions such as AEA and SDC, and 27 shows running on Broadway were shut down. This marked the first strike on Broadway in Local One’s 120-year history, and the strike lasted for 19 days, recording the longest strike on Broadway since 1975.&lt;ref name="2007 Strike 3"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Robertson| first1=Campbell| title=Stagehands End Walkout on Broadway| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/29/theater/29broadway.html?_r=0| accessdate=13 May 2015| work=The New York Times| date=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic impact of the strike spread beyond the Broadway shows, to nearby restaurants, hotels, gift shops, and bars. Tim Tompkins, the head of the Times Square Business Improvement District, explained that “a lot of folks come to New York specifically to go to a Broadway show and with this cloud of uncertainty, they postpone or cancel their trips. So that’s a double hit." &lt;ref name="2007 Strike 4"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Gans| first1=Andrew| title=Day 5: Most of Broadway Remains Dark| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/day-5-most-of-broadway-remains-dark-145401|accessdate=13 May 2015| work=Playbill| date=14 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New York City comptroller’s office, the strike resulted in $2 million in lost revenue per day in addition to the lost ticket sales, mounting to $40 million total.&lt;ref name="2007 Strike 3" /&gt;

The main conflict in the negotiation was the work rules regarding load-ins. The existing contract required producers to determine a number of stagehands needed for the load-in ahead of time, and hire and pay all of them every day for the entire load-in period, which could take weeks to months for large-scale productions. However, because the workload differs everyday, many stagehands often just stayed in the theatres with nothing to do. The new contract set the daily minimum during the load-in to 17 stagehands, allowing the producers to hire stagehands based on daily workload.&lt;ref name="2007 Strike 3" /&gt;

=== Broadway musicians strike in 2003 ===
{{main|2003 Broadway Musicians Strike}}

The Local 802 of AFM, the union representing the musicians on Broadway, entered into a strike in March 2003 and was joined by other Broadway unions such as AEA and IATSE. The strike lasted from Friday, March 7, 2003, to early Tuesday morning, March 11, 2003.&lt;ref name="2003 Strike 1"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Pogrebin| first1=Robin| title=Theater Strike Ends After All-Night Talks| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/nyregion/11CND-STRIKE.html| accessdate=13 May 2015| work=The New York Times| date=11 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of the negotiation was the minimum number of musicians required to be employed in Broadway theatres. The labor agreement required 24 to 25 musicians to be employed in largest theatres, regardless of the needs of the actual productions presented. Under the new agreement, the minimums were reduced to 18 to 19.&lt;ref name="2003 Strike 1"/&gt;

== Government relations ==
The Broadway League has advocated for the needs of commercial theatre industry with local, state and national elected officials throughout its history, beginning with writing of the Theater Ticket Code of Fair Practice which became a state law in 1940. Recent lobbying efforts by the League include opposing an 8 percent levy on theatre tickets proposed by Governor [[David Paterson]] in 2009, and securing tax deductions for suppliers of physical goods used by theatrical productions.&lt;ref name="Tax Lobbying 3"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Healy|first1=Patrick|title=Paterson Eliminates Proposed Tax on Theater Tickets| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/paterson-eliminates-new-levy-on-theater-tickets/| accessdate=27 March 2015| work=The New York Times| date=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Tax Lobbying 2" /&gt;

===Wireless microphone spectrum===
The Broadway League, in conjunction with the [[National Football League]] and large churches, is protesting against the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]]’s plans to auction the frequencies used by wireless microphones used in theatres and venues throughout the U.S.&lt;ref name="FCC Lobbying 1"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Wyatt| first1=Edward| title=U.S. May Sell Airwaves That Help Broadway Sing| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/business/fcc-has-yen-for-broadways-wireless-spectrum.html| accessdate=27 March 2015| work=The New York Times| date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FCC Lobbying 2"&gt;{{cite episode| last1=Karr| first1=Rick| title=NFL, Broadway Fight FCC Auction Of Broadcast Spectrum| url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/11/363342242/nfl-broadway-fight-fcc-auction-of-broadcast-spectrum| accessdate=2017-08-23| network=[[NPR]]| series=All Things Considered| series-link=All Things Considered| air-date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Support Theaters in America Growth and Expansion Act===
As a result of lobbying initiatives by the Broadway League, in February 2015, Sen. [[Charles Schumer]] (D-N.Y.) and Sen. [[Roy Blunt]] (R-Mo.) reintroduced legislation named The Support Theaters in America Growth and Expansion Act that would provide Broadway and live theatrical productions federal tax benefits already given to film and TV productions.&lt;ref name="Tax Lobbying 1"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Johnson| first1=Ted| title=Sen.

The League hopes that the benefits of Section 181 would make attracting investors easier, because the investors are currently paying income taxes before recoupment, without making any profit from projects.&lt;ref name="Tax Lobbying 2"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Cox| first1=Gordon| title=Broadway May Be Closer to Earning an IRS Write-Off| url=https://variety.com/2013/legit/news/broadway-may-be-closer-to-earning-an-irs-write-off-1200502802/|accessdate=27 March 2015| work=Variety| date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Award programs ==

=== The Tony Awards ===
{{main|Tony Awards}}
[[File:Robert Lopez Jeff Marx Tony Awards.jpg|thumb|2004 Tony Award for Best Original Score winner, Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx]]
The Antoinette Perry Awards for Excellence in Theatre, more commonly known as the Tony Awards, recognize achievement in live American theatre. The Tony Awards are presented by the Tony Award Productions, a joint venture of [[American Theatre Wing]] and the League, at an annual ceremony in [[New York City]]. The awards are mostly for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions and performances, though an award for regional theatres and discretionary non-competitive [[Special Tony Award]] and the [[Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre]] are also given.&lt;ref name=TonyHistory&gt;{{cite web| title=History|  publisher=The Tony Awards| url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/archive/index.html| accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/about/index.html| publisher=The Tony Awards| title=Who's Who| accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were founded by the Wing in 1947, and the League became a co-presenter in 1967.&lt;ref name=TonyHistory/&gt;{{sfn|Bloom|2003|p=531-532}}

Prior to 2000, membership in what was then the League of American Theaters and Producers was lifetime for all dues-paying above-the-title producers of Broadway shows.  Members received two free tickets to all Broadway shows, and ballots for the Tony Awards, vouching that they had seen all shows in every category in which they voted. In 2000, the League changed membership eligibility to "active" producers, those who had been above-the-title in the previous 10 years. This action dis-enfranchised scores of Tony voters, including [[Gail Berman]], [[Harve Brosten]], [[Dick Button]], [[Tony Lo Bianco]], and [[Raymond Serra]].

=== The Touring Broadway Awards ===
{{main|Touring Broadway Awards}}

The Touring Broadway Awards (TBAs) recognized outstanding achievement in touring productions of Broadway [[play (theatre)|plays]] and [[musical theatre|musicals]] in North America from 2000 to 2009.
Founded in 2000-2001 season by the League, the awards were known until 2004 as the National Broadway Theatre Awards.&lt;ref name="Playbill.com: Touring Broadway Awards 2"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Simonson| first1=Robert| title=National Broadway Theatre Awards Presented on May 21| date=May 21, 2001| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/national-broadway-theatre-awards-presented-on-may-21-96727| work=Playbill| accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were presented by the League to "celebrate excellence in touring Broadway by honoring the artists and productions that visit cities across the country each year."&lt;ref name="Playbill.com: Touring Broadway Awards"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Gans| first1=Andrew| title=Minnelli and Zaks Will Be Presenters at Touring Broadway Awards| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/minnelli-and-zaks-will-be-presenters-at-touring-broadway-awards-160504| work=Playbill| accessdate=11 March 2015| date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concert programs ==
[[File:Cast of Rent performing "Seasons of Love" at Broadway on Broadway, 2005.jpg|thumb|Cast of ''Rent'' performing "Seasons of Love" at Broadway on Broadway, 2005]]
The Broadway League produces various concert programs such as ''Broadway on Broadway'' and ''Stars in the Alley'' to promote productions currently running on Broadway.

''Broadway on Broadway'' was a free annual outdoor concert kicking off the Broadway season each September, usually on the first Sunday after Labor Day, produced by the League and the Times Square Alliance. Initially conceived as a welcome party for delegates to the 1992 [[Democratic National Convention]] in New York, the event took place on a special stage created for the event in [[Times Square]], featuring musical numbers from current Broadway shows as well as upcoming shows opening in the new season.&lt;ref name="Broadway on Broadway"&gt;{{cite web| title=Broadway on Broadway| url=http://www.timessquarenyc.org/events/broadway-on-broadway/index.aspx#.VQCwlIGG-oW| website=The Official Site of Times Square| publisher=Times Square Alliance| accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concert returned in July 1993 and 1994 and moved to September on 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.broadwayleague.com/broadway-on-broadway/index.php?url_identifier=the-concert| title=The Concert| publisher=The Broadway League| accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League canceled ''Broadway on Broadway'' in 2013 and it did not return in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Gilbert| first1=Ryan| title=Broadway on Broadway Outdoor Concert in Times Square Canceled for 2013| url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/171654/broadway-on-broadway-outdoor-concert-in-times-square-canceled-for-2013/| website=Broadway.com| accessdate=11 March 2015| date=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Stars in the Alley'' is a free annual outdoor concert in [[Shubert Alley]] in the heart of Manhattan’s [[Theater District, New York|Theatre District]], produced by the League. It is usually held during the week of the Tony Awards, and marks the official end of the Broadway season. The 21st annual event was held on June 6, 2007, and the casts of dozens of Broadway shows took part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Mark| last=Rupp| url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Photo_Coverage_Stars_in_the_Alley_2007_20070607| title=Photo Coverage: Stars in the Alley 2007| publisher=Broadway World| accessdate=2010-07-07| date=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the event was not held from 2008 to 2013, it returned in 2014 featuring [[Norm Lewis]] as the host.&lt;ref name="Theatermania: Stars in the Alley"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Gordon| first1=David| title=Phantom Star Norm Lewis Will Host Broadway's 2014 Stars in the Alley Concert| url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/news/05-2014/phantom-star-norm-lewis-will-host-broadways-2014-s_68465.html| website=Theatermania.com| accessdate=11 March 2015| date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tony Awards Preview Concert'' was a cabaret-style concert featuring songs from Tony-nominated shows held in 2008, 2009 and 2013. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Andrew| last=Gans| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/126513-2008-Tony-Preview-Concert-Nominated-for-a-New-York-Emmy-Award| title=2008 Tony Preview Concert Nominated for a New York Emmy Award| work=Playbill| accessdate=2010-07-07| date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Andrew| last=Gans| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/129688-Tony-Awards-Preview-Concert-Hosted-By-Harry-Smith-Airs-May-30| title=Tony Awards Preview Concert, Hosted By Harry Smith, Airs May 30| work=Playbill| accessdate=2010-07-07| date=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 concert, hosted by [[Mario Lopez]], was aired at various times and dates in 18 cities across the United States and included interviews from the then Tony nominees such as [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Andrea Martin]], [[Mark Rylance]], and [[Rob Ashford]].&lt;ref name="tv"&gt;{{cite web| title=Lopez Hosts Tony Award Preview Concert Nationwide| url=http://broadway.tv/lopez-hosts-tony-award-preview-concert-nationwide/| website=Broadway.tv| accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other concert programs include ''Broadway Under the Stars'', an annual evening concert held from 2002 to 2006, and a benefit concert for Viva Broadway, an audience development initiative specifically targeted to Hispanic communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first1=Andrew| last1=Gans| first2=Ernio| last2=Hernandez| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/100502-Broadway-Under-the-Stars-Heads-to-Central-Park-June-26| title="Broadway Under the Stars" Heads to Central Park June 26| work=Playbill| accessdate=2010-07-07| date=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Robert| last=Simonson|authorlink1=Robert Simonson| url=http://www.playbill.com/article/broadway-under-the-stars-debuts-in-nycs-bryant-park-june-10-com-106271| title=Broadway Under the Stars" Debuts in NYC's Bryant Park, June 10| work=Playbill| accessdate=2010-07-07| date=4 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Viva Broadway Benefit Concert"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Gioia| first1=Michael| title=Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine Will Hit Broadway's Minskoff for One Night Only| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/gloria-estefan-miami-sound-machine-will-hit-broadways-minskoff-for-one-night-only-339292| work=Playbill| date=14 January 2015| accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audience development programs ==
The Broadway League leads audience development programs targeting specific communities to broaden the audience base for Broadway productions. For example, [[Kids' Night on Broadway]] was created by the League and the [[Theater Development Fund]] to provide families across the U.S. affordable access to Broadway productions. On Kids' Night On Broadway, children between ages 6 to 18 receive free tickets to participating Broadway shows when accompanied by a paying adult.&lt;ref name="Kids' Night On Broadway"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Pogrebin| first1=Robin| title=Broadway Goes To School to Get 'Em Young; A Drive to Turn Children Into Avid Theatergoers| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/18/theater/broadway-goes-school-get-em-young-drive-turn-children-into-avid-theatergoers.html?pagewanted=print| accessdate=23 March 2015| work=The New York Times| date=18 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Family First Nights introduce economically at-risk families to Broadway productions in New York as well as around the country through subsidized tickets.

In 2012, the League launched a new audience development program named Viva Broadway, which focuses on Hispanic communities around the country. Working with Hispanic media outlets, Viva Broadway aims to promote Broadway to Hispanic families, proposing theatergoing experiences that fit their lifestyles and cultural traditions to engage in family activities involving multiple generations.&lt;ref name="Viva Broadway 1"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Gioia| first1=Michael| title=The Broadway League Launches Viva Broadway Initiative; Raúl Esparza, Karen Olivo, Chita Rivera Among Advisory Board| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/the-broadway-league-launches-viva-broadway-initiative-raul-esparza-karen-ol-193521| accessdate=26 April 2015| work=Playbill| date=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadway Speakers Bureau, a program that encourages high school and college students to pursue non-performance careers in theatre, was also created as a part of Viva Broadway.&lt;ref name="Viva Broadway 2"&gt;{{cite news| title=10 Facts to Know About The Broadway League, Co-Presenter of The Tony Awards| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/10-facts-to-know-about-the-broadway-league-co-presenter-of-the-tony-aw-322058/print?r=n| accessdate=26 April 2015| work=Playbill| date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==

===Internet Broadway Database===
{{main|Internet Broadway Database}}

Operated by the research department of the League, The Internet Broadway Database (IBDB) is an online [[database]] of Broadway theatre productions and their personnel, including lengths of runs, lists of casts and creators, awards and nominations, and past box office grosses.&lt;ref name="TicketNews: IBDB App" /&gt; It is "a definitive source for the facts on Broadway musicals and plays from Aristophanes to Ziegfeld," according to the New York Public Library.&lt;ref name="NYPL: IBDB"&gt;{{cite web| title=Internet Broadway Database| url=http://www.nypl.org/collections/articles-databases/internet-broadway-database| website=New York Public Library| accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the League introduced a free iOS app for IBDB that contain much of the same information as the website, as well as photos and videos from current Broadway productions.&lt;ref name="TicketNews: IBDB App"&gt;{{cite news| last1=LaFountain| first1=Kristina| title=The Broadway League develops IBDB application| url=http://www.ticketnews.com/news/the-broadway-league-develops-IBDB-application0312595| accessdate=28 March 2015| publisher=TicketNews| date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

The League serves as the central hub for statistical information about Broadway theatre production in North America. Its research department maintains historical data on individual playhouses and productions. In addition, many reference documents, including weekly box office grosses and season-by-season statistics, are available to the public, journalists, and scholars via the website. Theatre publications such as ''The New York Times'', ''Playbill'', and ''Variety'' publish databases and articles using data provided by the League.

The research department also publishes annual reports that track trends in the industry over time including the Demographics of the Broadway Audience and Broadway’s Economic Contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=|url=http://www.broadwayleague.com/index.php?url_identifier=research-and-information-1|title=Research &amp; Statistics |publisher=The Broadway League| accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain demographic information, the League hands out questionnaires at select performances to directly survey audience members. The survey tracks basic demographic information such as their gender, age, place of residence, and ethnicity, as well as theatergoing behaviors such as the number of plays and musicals they have attended in the past six months. For example, ''The New York Times'' reported that "tourists accounted for nearly two-thirds of the tickets sold for Broadway shows" and "those who saw 15 shows or more made up only 5 percent of the overall audience, but accounted for 29 percent of admissions" in 2010-11 season based on the studies published by the League.&lt;ref name="Demographic Research"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Schuessler| first1=Jennifer| title=Tourists Increase Share of Broadway Ticket Sales| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/tourists-increase-share-of-broadway-ticket-sales/| accessdate=26 April 2015| work=The New York Times| date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The First Supper''''' (1988) is a work of art by [[Susan Dorothea White]], based on [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]''. White's painting is acrylic on a large wood panel (1.2 x 2.4 m) and, in a challenge to the patriarchal concept of thirteen men on one side of a table, shows 13 women from all regions of the world; the woman in the position of Leonardo's Christ figure is an Australian aboriginal wearing a T-shirt with the [[Australian Aboriginal Flag]].  The only white woman seen is in the position of Judas.  She dines on a Coca-Cola and a hamburger, while all the other women are seen with a bread roll and glass of water.  The painting toured Australia in the [[Blake Prize for Religious Art]] exhibition in 1988, where it was ridiculed,&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Christopher. 'Ludicrous Leonardo', ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 23 December 1988, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; before being exhibited in the artist's solo exhibition in Amsterdam, where it featured in the Dutch art journal ''Kunstbeeld'': "The work shows clearly Susan White's thinking about human rights. It should be mentioned here that she sometimes places her many faceted talent at the service of the struggle for human rights".&lt;ref&gt;''Susan White - veelzijdig werk'', Kunstbeeld (Amsterdam) Oct. 1990, vol. 14 (10) p.62 (translation).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Tripods''''' is a television adaptation of [[John Christopher]]'s ''[[The Tripods]]'' series of novels. It was jointly produced by the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom and the [[Seven Network]] in Australia. The music soundtrack was written by [[Ken Freeman (composer)|Ken Freeman]].

Series one of ''The Tripods'', broadcast in 1984, which had 13 half-hour episodes written by the author of many radio plays [[Alick Rowe]], covers the first book, ''The White Mountains''; the 12-episode second series (1985) covers ''The City of Gold and Lead''.  Although a television script had been written for the third series, it never went into production.

The first series was released on both VHS and DVD. The BBC released ''Tripods&amp;nbsp;— The Complete Series 1 &amp; 2'' on DVD in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000R21294 |title=Tripods&amp;nbsp;— The Complete Series 1 &amp; 2 DVD |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series introduced several minor changes from the book, notably the shape of the [[Masters (The Tripods)|Masters]] and Tripods, which have tentacles (although the Tripods do have a mechanical claw-arm that they sometimes use) in the book; the Black Guard was introduced to serve as a tangible human antagonist as overuse of the Tripods themselves would be expensive to film and undermine their dramatic presence; gravity inside the Golden City was increased artificially, which is not mentioned in the TV series; the introduction of "cognoscs", spiritual life-forms vastly superior to the Masters themselves; and more other main characters, including love interests for both Will and Beanpole. The original texts have few female characters. John Christopher was asked about this for an interview on ''Wordcandy'',&lt;ref name=worldcandy&gt;[http://www.wordcandy.net/5-12-2006-the-white-mountains Wordcandy review of ''The White Mountains'']&lt;/ref&gt; replying that at the time of writing the series, it was generally accepted that girls would read books with boy main characters, but not vice versa. He also stated that he felt the addition of an entire family of girls to the TV series was somewhat "over the top".&lt;ref name=worldcandy/&gt; The series is also notable for featuring non-humanoid aliens, which was uncommon at the time.

[[Charlotte Long]], who played Will's love interest Eloise, died in a car crash shortly after the start of transmission of the first series. For the second series, the role was briefly recast, with [[Cindy Shelley]] appearing as Eloise during a dream sequence.

[[Image:Repliee Q2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Repliee]] Q2, an uncannily lifelike robot, developed by roboticists at [[Osaka University]]. It can mimic such human functions as blinking, breathing and speaking, with the ability to recognise and process speech and touch, and then respond in kind.]]
The '''uncanny''' is the [[psychological]] experience of something as ''strangely familiar'', rather than simply mysterious.&lt;ref&gt;Royle, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It may describe incidents where a familiar thing or event is encountered in an unsettling, eerie, or [[taboo]] context.&lt;ref&gt;Royle, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D. Bate, 2004 p. 39-40"&gt;D. Bate, ''Photography and Surrealism'' (2004) p. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the uncanny  was perhaps first fixed by [[Sigmund Freud]] in his 1919 essay ''Das Unheimliche'', which explores the eeriness of dolls and waxworks.&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;{{cite web |last=Freud |first=Sigmund |authorlink=Sigmund Freud |title=Das Unheimliche |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~amtower/uncanny.html |year=1919 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714192553/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~amtower/uncanny.html |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Freud, the uncanny locates the strangeness in the ordinary.&lt;ref name="D. Bate, 2004 p. 39-40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unheimliche"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lim |first=Dennis |authorlink= Dennis Lim|title=“David Lynch should be shot”: Looking back on the madness and chaos of “Blue Velvet” and Ronald Reagan’s ’80s |url=https://www.salon.com/2016/03/26/david_lynch_should_be_shot_looking_back_on_the_madness_and_chaos_of_blue_velvet_and_ronald_reagans_80s/ |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on the idea, [[psychoanalytic]] theorist [[Jacques Lacan]] wrote that the uncanny places us "in the field where we do not know how to distinguish bad and good, pleasure from displeasure", resulting in an irreducible [[anxiety]] that gestures to [[the Real]]. The concept has since been taken up by a variety of subsequent thinkers and theorists such as Roboticist [[Masahiro Mori (roboticist)|Masahiro Mori]]'s "[[uncanny valley]]" hypothesis and [[Julia Kristeva]]'s concept of [[abjection]].

==History==

===German idealism===
Philosopher [[F. W. J. Schelling]] raised the question of the uncanny in his late ''Philosophie der Mythologie'' of 1835, postulating that the Homeric clarity was built upon a prior repression of the uncanny.&lt;ref&gt;A. Vidler, ''The Architectural Uncanny'' (1994) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' manuscript, German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] refers to [[nihilism]] as "the uncanniest of all guests" and, earlier, in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' he argues it is the "will to truth" that has destroyed the [[metaphysics]] that underpins the values of Western culture. Hence, he coins the phrase "European nihilism" to describe the condition that afflicts those Enlightenment ideals that seemingly hold strong values yet undermine themselves.

===Ernst Jentsch===
Uncanniness was first explored psychologically by [[Ernst Jentsch]] in a 1906 essay, ''On the Psychology of the Uncanny''. Jentsch defines the ''Uncanny'' as: being a product of "...intellectual uncertainty; so that the uncanny would always, as it were, be something one does not know one’s way about in. The better oriented in his environment a person is, the less readily will he get the impression of something uncanny in regard to the objects and events in it."&lt;ref name="unheimliche" /&gt; He expands upon its use in fiction:

{{quote|In telling a story one of the most successful devices for easily creating uncanny effects is to leave the reader in uncertainty whether a particular figure in the story is a human being or an automaton and to do it in such a way that his attention is not focused directly upon his uncertainty, so that he may not be led to go into the matter and clear it up immediately.&lt;ref name="unheimliche" /&gt;}}

Jentsch identifies German writer [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] as a writer who uses uncanny effects in his work, focusing specifically on Hoffmann's story "The Sandman" ("[[Der Sandmann]]"), which features a lifelike doll, Olympia.

===Sigmund Freud===
The concept of the Uncanny was later elaborated on and developed by [[Sigmund Freud]] in his 1919 essay "The Uncanny", which also draws on the work of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]] (whom Freud refers to as the "unrivalled master of the uncanny in literature"). However, he criticizes Jentsch's belief that Olympia is the central uncanny element in the story ("[[Der Sandmann|The Sandman]]"):

{{quote|I cannot think – and I hope most readers of the story will agree with me – that the theme of the doll Olympia, who is to all appearances a living being, is by any means the only, or indeed the most important, element that must be held responsible for the quite unparalleled atmosphere of uncanniness evoked by the story.&lt;ref name="unheimliche" /&gt;}}

Instead, Freud draws on a wholly different element of the story, namely, "the idea of being robbed of one's eyes", as the "more striking instance of uncanniness" in the tale.

Freud goes on, for the remainder of the essay, to identify uncanny effects that result from instances of "repetition of the same thing," linking the concept to that of the [[repetition compulsion]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Royle, ''The Uncanny'' (2003) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; He includes incidents wherein one becomes lost and accidentally retraces one's steps, and instances wherein random numbers recur, seemingly meaningfully (here Freud may be said to be prefiguring the concept that [[Carl Jung|Jung]] would later refer to as [[synchronicity]]). He also discusses the uncanny nature of [[Otto Rank]]'s concept of the "double".

Freud specifically relates an aspect of the ''Uncanny'' derived from German etymology. By contrasting the German adjective ''unheimlich'' with its base word ''heimlich'' ("concealed, hidden, in secret"), he proposes that social taboo often yields an aura not only of pious reverence but even more so of horror and even disgust, as the taboo state of an item gives rise to the commonplace assumption that that which is hidden from ''public eye'' (cf. the ''eye'' or ''sight'' metaphor) must be a dangerous threat and even an abomination – especially if the concealed item is obviously or presumingly sexual in nature. Basically, the ''Uncanny'' is what unconsciously reminds us of our own ''[[Id, ego, and super-ego|Id]]'', our forbidden and thus [[Psychological repression|repressed impulses]] – especially when placed in a context of uncertainty that can remind one of infantile beliefs in the [[omnipotence]] of thought.&lt;ref name="D. Bate, 2004 p. 39-40"/&gt; Such uncanny elements are perceived as threatening by our ''[[Id, ego, and super-ego|super-ego]]'' ridden with [[Oedipus complex|oedipal guilt]] as it fears [[Castration anxiety|symbolic castration]] by punishment for deviating from societal norms. Thus, the items and individuals that we [[Psychological projection|project]] our own repressed impulses upon become a most ''uncanny'' threat to us, ''uncanny'' monsters and freaks akin to fairy-tale folk-devils, and subsequently often become scapegoats we blame for all sorts of perceived miseries, calamities, and maladies.

{{quote|What interests us most in this long extract is to find that among its different shades of meaning the word ''heimlich'' exhibits one which is identical with its opposite, ''unheimlich''. What is ''heimlich'' thus comes to be ''unheimlich''. [...] In general we are reminded that the word ''heimlich'' is not unambiguous, but belongs to two sets of ideas, which, without being contradictory, are yet very different: on the one hand it means what is familiar and agreeable, and on the other, what is concealed and kept out of sight. ''Unheimlich'' is customarily used, we are told, as the contrary only of the first signification of ''heimlich'', and not of the second. [...] On the other hand, we notice that Schelling says something which throws quite a new light on the concept of the ''Unheimlich'', for which we were certainly not prepared. According to him, everything is ''unheimlich'' that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light.

[...]

A study of dreams, phantasies and myths has taught us that anxiety about one's eyes, the fear of going blind ''[as used as a central theme in "The Sandman"]'', is often enough a substitute for the dread of being castrated. The self-blinding of the mythical criminal, Oedipus, was simply a mitigated form of the punishment of castration – the only punishment that was adequate for him by the ''lex talionis''. [...] All further doubts are removed when we learn the details of their 'castration complex' from the analysis of [[Neurosis#Psychoanalytical account of neurosis|neurotic patients]], and realize its immense importance in their mental life.&lt;ref name="unheimliche" /&gt;}}

After Freud, [[Jacques Lacan]], in his 1962–1963 seminar "L'angoisse" ("Anxiety"), used the Unheimlich "via regia" to enter into the territory of Angst.&lt;ref&gt;A. Vidler, ''The Architectural Uncanny'' (1994) p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan showed how the same image that seduces the subject, trapping him in the narcissistic impasse, may suddenly, by a contingency, show that it is dependent on something, some hidden object, and so the subject may grasp at the same time that he is not autonomous (5 December 1962). For example, and as a paradigm, [[Guy de Maupassant]], in his story "Le Horla", describes a man who suddenly may see his own back in the mirror. His back is there, but it is deprived of the gaze of the subject. It appears as a strange object, until he feels it is his own. There is no cognitive dissonance here, we rather cross all possible cognition, to find ourselves in the field where we do not know how to distinguish bad and good, pleasure from displeasure. And this is the signal of anxiety: the signal of the real, as irreducible to any signifier.

Hitchcock was the master in the art of conducing art into the world of Unheimlich.&lt;ref&gt;N. Royle, ''The Uncanny'' (2003) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  He used simple, everyday objects who may suddenly lose their familiar side, and become the messenger of beyond narcissism.&lt;ref&gt;S. Zizek, ''Looking Awry'' (1992) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The uncanny valley is the region of negative emotional response towards robots that seem "almost human". Movement amplifies the emotional response.]]

This concept is closely related to [[Julia Kristeva]]'s concept of [[abjection]], where one reacts adversely to something forcefully cast out of the [[symbolic order]]. Abjection can be uncanny in that the observer can recognize something within the abject, possibly of what it was before it was 'cast out', yet be repulsed by what it is that caused it to be cast out to begin with. Kristeva lays special emphasis on the uncanny return of the past abject with relation to the 'uncanny stranger'.&lt;ref&gt;S. Beardsworth, ''Julia Kristeva'' (2012) pp. 189–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadeq Rahimi has noted a common relationship between the uncanny and direct or metaphorical visual references, which he  explains in terms of basic processes of ego development, specifically as developed by Lacan's theory of the [[mirror stage]]. Rahimi presents a wide range of evidence from various contexts to demonstrate how uncanny experiences are typically associated with themes and metaphors of vision, blindness, mirrors and other optical tropes. He also presents historical evidence showing strong presence of ocular and specular themes and associations in the literary and psychological tradition out of which the notion of 'the uncanny' emerged. According to Rahimi, instances of the uncanny like [[doppelgänger]]s, [[ghost]]s, ''[[déjà vu]]'', [[alter ego]]s, self-alienations and split personhoods, phantoms, [[twin]]s, living dolls, etc. share two important features: that they are closely tied with visual tropes, and that they are variations on the theme of doubling of the ego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rahimi |first=S. |date=June 2013 |title=The ego, the ocular, and the uncanny: Why are metaphors of vision central in accounts of the uncanny? |journal=[[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]] |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=453–476 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-8315.2012.00660.x |pmid=23781831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roboticist [[Masahiro Mori (roboticist)|Masahiro Mori]]'s "[[uncanny valley]]" hypothesis (describing human reactions to human-like robots) describes the gap between familiar living people and their also familiar inanimate representations, such as statues or pictures. The things in the valley are between these two poles of common phenomena. The hypothesis is deeply indebted to Jentsch and Freud's observations.

==Etymology==
''Canny'' is from the Anglo-Saxon root ''ken'': "knowledge, understanding, or cognizance; mental perception: ''an idea beyond one's ken''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of ken |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ken |work=[[Dictionary.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the uncanny is something outside one's familiar knowledge or perceptions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">'''Useful art''', or '''useful arts''' or '''technics''', is concerned with the skills and methods of practical subjects such as manufacture and craftsmanship. The phrase has now gone out of fashion, but it was used during the [[Victorian era]] and earlier as an antonym to the [[performing art]] and the [[fine art]].&lt;ref&gt; George Washington used the term in a letter to Lafayette (Jan. 29, 1798). Washington distinguished commerce from useful arts by stating, “While our commerce has been considerably curtailed for want of that extensive credit formerly given in Europe, and for default of remittance; the useful arts have been almost imperceptibly pushed to a considerable degree of perfection.”  THE WRITINGS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT SOURCES, 1732-1799 (Fitzpatrick ed.).  Other literary sources are collected in the PTO Supp. Br., ''In re Bilski'', p. 11 n.4 (useful arts are manufacturing processes).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "useful Arts" is used in the [[United States Constitution]], [[Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_8:_Powers_of_Congress|Article One, Section 8, Clause 8]] which is the basis of United States [[patents in the United States|patent]] and [[Copyright in the United States|copyright]] law:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;…"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the clause, the phrase "useful Arts" is meant to reference inventions, while "Science" is meant to reference human knowledge, including{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} that which is encompassed in literature and the "fine arts".

In his dissenting opinion in ''[[In re Bilski]]'',&lt;ref&gt;In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haldane Robert Mayer|Judge Mayer]] criticized the majority for not addressing the preliminary issue of whether the claimed invention was within the useful arts. In Mayer's view this should have been dispositive, because he considered the claimed [[business method]] not to be within the useful arts. In the same case, [[Timothy Dyk|Judge Dyk]] filed a concurring opinion to similar effect.&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://works.bepress.com/malla_pollack/12  Malla Pollack], "The Multiple Unconstitutionality of Business Method Patents: Common Sense, Congressional Choice, and Constitutional History" 61 Rutgers Computer &amp; Tech.

'''''Water Willow''''' is an 1871 oil painting by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]].  It depicts [[Jane Morris]] in the river landscape near [[Kelmscott Manor]], with the manor in the left background and Kelmscott Church below the hill to the right.&lt;ref name="Wildman"&gt;Wildman (2004), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti Study for Water Willow.jpg|left|thumb|Chalk study for ''Water Willow''.  [[Birmingham Museums &amp; Art Gallery]].]]
In May 1871, [[William Morris]] rented Kelmscott Manor, a 17th-century limestone manor house along the [[Thames]] near [[Kelmscott]] in [[Oxfordshire]], to be a summer escape from London.  Rossetti shared the lease, but the house soon became a retreat for Rossetti and Morris's wife Jane to have a long-lasting and complicated liaison. The two spent an idyllic summer there, with the Morris children, in 1871, while Morris himself travelled to [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd (2001), pp. 123–130.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rossetti made a version of ''Water Willow'' in coloured chalks at Kelmscott, and then painted the small oil "to fit a beautiful old frame I have"&lt;ref name="Treuherz"&gt;Treuherz (2003), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; In the chalk study, Jane holds a [[Viola tricolor|pansy]], symbol of love and remembrance, rather than the willow branches, a symbol of sorrow and longing, of the final painting.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;

In 1877, facing financial difficulties, Rossetti sold the painting to "a new buyer", William Alfred Turner (1839–1886),  a Manchester cotton spinner, who also purchased ''[[Proserpine (Rossetti painting)|Proserpine]]'' at that time.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wildman (2004), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Rossetti apologized to Jane Morris for selling the work, saying he was "really mortally sorry to part with the Kelmscott picture" but "felt there was no alternative".&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;

==Provenance and exhibitions==
After Turner's death, the painting was sold at auction by [[Christie's]] on 28 April 1888 and was bought in by his executors.  ''Water Willow'' was the first [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painting acquired by the American collector [[Samuel Bancroft]], who purchased it in 1890.  Bancroft later sent the painting back to England to be repaired by [[Charles Fairfax Murray]]. Murray asked and received Bancroft's permission to make a copy that he gave to Jane Morris, because "she was to have had the picture, it being a great favourite of hers."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wildman, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The original was bequeathed to the [[Delaware Art Museum]] by Bancroft's descendants in 1935.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;

The painting was exhibited in Manchester in 1882 and again in 1887, London in 1883, and Philadelphia in 1892.
It was also exhibited in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in 1917 and 1934, [[New Haven, Connecticut]] in 1976, and Liverpool and Amsterdam in 2003.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;

'''''Waterfall''''' ({{lang-nl|Waterval}}) is a [[lithograph]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]], first printed in October 1961. It shows a [[perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] where water from the base of a [[waterfall]] appears to run downhill along the water path before reaching the top of the waterfall.

While most two-dimensional artists use relative proportions to create an illusion of depth, Escher here and elsewhere uses conflicting proportions to create a visual [[paradox]]. The [[watercourse]] supplying the waterfall (its [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] or [[leat]]) has the structure of two [[Penrose triangle]]s. A Penrose triangle is an [[impossible object]] designed by [[Oscar Reutersvärd]] in 1934, and found independently by [[Roger Penrose]] in 1958.&lt;ref name="Penrose 1958"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Penrose | first1=L. S. | last2=Penrose | first2=R. | title=Impossible objects: A special type of visual illusion

==Description==
The image depicts a watermill with an elevated [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] and [[waterwheel]] as the main feature. The aqueduct begins at the waterwheel and flows behind it. The walls of the aqueduct step downward, suggesting that it slopes downhill. The aqueduct turns sharply three times, first to the left, then to the right, and finally to the left again. The viewer looks down at the scene diagonally, which means that from the viewer's perspective the aqueduct appears to be slanted upward. The viewer is also looking across the scene diagonally from the lower right, which means that from the viewer's perspective the two left-hand turns are directly in line with each other, while the waterwheel, the forward turn and the end of the aqueduct are all in line. The second left-hand turn is supported by pillars from the first, while the other two corners are supported by a tower of pillars that begins at the waterwheel. The water falls off the edge of the aqueduct and over the waterwheel in an impossible infinite cycle; in his notes on the picture, Escher points out that some water must be periodically added to this [[perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] to compensate for [[evaporation]]. The use of the Penrose stairs is paralleled by Escher's ''[[Ascending and Descending (M. C. Escher)|Ascending and Descending]]'' (1960), where instead of the flow of water, two lines of monks endlessly march uphill or downhill around the four flights of stairs.&lt;ref name=MathSide&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schattschneider |first1=Doris| volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=706–718 |journal=Notices of the AMS |title=The Mathematical Side of M. C. Escher |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201006/rtx100600706p.pdf |publisher=American Mathematical Society |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two support towers continue above the aqueduct and are topped by two compound [[polyhedra]], revealing Escher's interest in [[mathematics and art|mathematics as an artist]]. The one on the left is a [[compound of three cubes]]. The one on the right is a [[stellation]] of a [[rhombic dodecahedron]] (or a compound of three non-regular [[octahedron|octahedra]]) and is known as [[Compound of three octahedra|Escher's solid]].

Below the mill is a garden of bizarre, giant plants. This is actually a magnified view of a cluster of [[moss]] and [[lichen]] that Escher drew in ink as a study in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Locher, J. L. |year=1971 |title=The World of M. C. Escher |publisher=[[Abrams Books|Abrams]] |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The background seems to be a climbing expanse of [[terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] farmland.
