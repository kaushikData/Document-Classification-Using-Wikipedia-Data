'''Arbeia''' was a large [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[castra|fort]] in [[South Shields]], [[Tyne and Wear|Tyne &amp; Wear]], [[England]], now ruined, and which has been partially reconstructed. It was first excavated in the 1870s and all modern buildings on the site were cleared in the 1970s.  It is managed by [[Tyne and Wear Museums]] as '''Arbeia Roman Fort and Museum'''.

== Original fort ==
The fort stands on the Lawe Top, overlooking the River Tyne. Founded in 120 AD, The Roman Fort guarded  the main sea route to Hadrian's Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arbeiaromanfort.org.uk/about-us/about-arbeia-roman-fort|title=About Arbeia, South Shields Roman Fort {{!}} Arbeia South Shields Roman Fort|website=arbeiaromanfort.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later became the maritime supply fort for [[Hadrian's Wall]], and contains the only permanent stone-built granaries yet found in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Feeding the army|journal=Archaeology|date=May–June 2017|volume=70|issue=3|page=33|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&amp;sid=133e1ca9-4e44-4ec2-a598-5e2a0149fc6e%40sessionmgr120|accessdate=8 July 2017|issn=0003-8113|postscript={{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Master File Complete}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was occupied until the Romans left Britain in the 5th century.

A possible meaning for "Arbeia" is "fort of the Arab troops",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook to the Roman Wall|last=Bruce|first=John|publisher=Society of Antiquaries|year=2006|isbn=|location=Newcastle Upon Tyne|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the fact that part of its garrison at one time was a squadron of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamian]] boatmen from the [[Tigris]]. From archaeological evidence, such as the gravestone of Victor, described below, it is known that a squadron of Spanish cavalry, the First Asturian, was stationed there. It was common for forts to be manned by units originally from elsewhere in the empire, though often enough these would assimilate and end up by recruiting locally.

Through the course of history of Arbeia, the fort has had several guises; From a busy cosmopolitan port to being the Roman Emperor's HQ for the Scottish invasion. It was a huge supply base for the Roman army, having hosted 600 Roman troops and is said to be the birthplace of the Northumbrian King Oswin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arbeiaromanfort.org.uk/about-us/about-arbeia-roman-fort|title=About Arbeia, South Shields Roman Fort {{!}} Arbeia South Shields Roman Fort|website=arbeiaromanfort.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Museum ==
Two monuments in the museum at Arbeia testify to the cosmopolitan nature of its shifting population. One commemorates Regina, a British woman of the [[Catuvellauni]] tribe (approximately modern [[Hertfordshire]]). She was first the slave, then the freedwoman and wife of Barates, a merchant from [[Palmyra]] (now part of [[Syria]]) who, evidently missing her greatly, set up a gravestone after she died at the age of 30. (Barates himself is buried at the nearby fort of [[Coria (Corbridge)]].) The second commemorates Victor, another former slave, freed by Numerianus of the Ala I Asturum, who also arranged his funeral ("piantissime": with all devotion) when Victor died at the age of 20. The stone records that Victor was "of the Moorish nation".

The museum also holds an altarpiece to a previously unknown god and a tablet with the name of the Emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (died 235) chiselled off.
[[File:Wall painting at Arbeia Roman Fort.JPG|thumb|left|Wall painting at Arbeia.]]

== Reconstruction ==
The Reconstruction of the fort has been accomplished using research which was undertaken following excavations, standing where it had originally existed during the Roman occupation of Britain. 

A Roman gatehouse, barracks and Commanding Officer's house have been reconstructed on their original foundations.  The gatehouse holds many displays related to the history of the fort, and its upper levels provide an overview of the archaeological site.

'''ArchINFORM''' is an [[online database]] for international [[architecture]], originally emerging from records of interesting building projects from architecture students from the [[University of Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]].

The self-described "largest online-database about worldwide architects and buildings", it contains plans and images of buildings both built and potential and forms a record of the architecture of the 20th century.  The database uses a search engine which allows a particular project to be found by listing architect, location or key word.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/go/Architecture/Reference/Links_1409.html Royal Institute of British Architects.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109122923/http://www.architecture.com/go/Architecture/Reference/Links_1409.html |date=November 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described by the librarian of the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] as "one of the most useful reference tools concerning
architecture available on the internet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archinform.net/info/comment.htm Barata, Ana. 2002. Librarian of the Biblioteca de Arte, Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5290">[[File:BT Holborn Telephone Exchange.jpg|thumb|BT Archives]]'''BT Archives''' is an [[archives|archive]] preserving the documentary heritage of [[BT Group plc|BT]] and its [[public sector]] predecessors.  It is designated an official place of deposit for [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|Public Records]], for those records created prior to [[BT Group#Privatisation|BT's privatisation]] in 1984.

The records include minutes, subject files, photographs, film and advertising material that tell the story of [[telecommunications]] in the UK and from the UK to overseas, from the formation of the private [[telegraph]] and [[telephone]] companies in the nineteenth century to the present day.  

==Major historical collections==
The earliest records held by BT Archives are those of the [[Electric Telegraph Company]] from 1846. Other private telegraph companies whose records are held are the British [[Electric Telegraph Company]], [[International Telegraph Company]], [[Submarine Telegraph Company]],  [[Electric and International Telegraph Company]], [[British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company]], [[London District Telegraph Company]], [[United Kingdom Electric Telegraph Company]], [[Universal Private Telegraph Company]], [[Eastern Telegraph Company]], [[British Telegraph Company]], [[Irish Submarine Telegraph Company]], [[English and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company]] and the [[Anglo-American Telegraph Company]]. BT Archives also holds documents relating to the UK telegraph service of the British [[Post Office]]; the private companies being brought under the control of the Post Office in 1870.

BT Archives also holds records of the private telephone companies and of the Post Office telephone services. The private telephone companies represented are the [[Telephone Company Limited (Bell's Patents)]], [[Edison Telephone Company of London Limited]], [[United Telephone Company]], [[Lancashire and Cheshire Telephonic Exchange Company Limited]], [[Northern District Telephone Company]], [[National Telephone Company]], [[Western Counties and South Wales Telephone Company]], [[Corporation of Glasgow Telephone Department]] and [[London and Globe Telephone Maintenance Company]].

[[Post Office Telecommunications]] activities continue concurrently and subsequently to the private telegraph and telephone companies. These are documented in the records of the Post Office telegraph and telephone service 1864-1969 and the Post Office Corporation (Telecommunications division) 1969-1981.

From 1 October 1981, British Telecommunications, trading as [[British Telecom]], severed its links with the Post Office and became a totally separate public corporation. Records of British Telecommunications (public corporation) are held from 1981 until privatisation in 1984.  Records after privatisation, of British Telecommunications plc 1984-2001, and of BT Group plc from 2001, continue to be preserved and made available for researchers in line with BT's heritage policy.

The British Phone Book collection is a major resource for [[genealogy]] and [[family history]], containing a near-complete set of [[United Kingdom]] [[Telephone directory|telephone directories]] from the first one issued in 1880. For preservation reasons the phone books are generally accessed on [[microfilm]], and the phone books 1880-1984 are digitised and have been made available online.

BT Archives cares for more than 500,000 images and 1,000 film titles. Selected images can be found on BT Archives online image gallery.

==Location and access==
BT Archives is based in Holborn Telephone Exchange in the [[Holborn]] area of central [[London]] and is open, by appointment, to public researchers on Mondays and Tuesday from 10:00am - 4:00pm. There is no access charge.

Descriptions of the historic collections are available on the BT Archives online catalogue.

Full access, acquisition and preservation policies can be found on the [http://www.bt.com/archives BT Archives website]

==Partnerships and governance==
It is a partner in the [[Connected Earth]] network, the heritage initiative founded by BT in 2001 to safeguard telecommunications artefacts.

BT Archives and Connected Earth together form BT Heritage, part of BT's [[corporate responsibility]] programme.

'''Bessie''' is an historic, single ended riveted iron day boat, built in 1895 for the Hartshill Iron Company. It is now owned by the [[Black Country Living Museum]], [[Dudley]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England, where it is based.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bclm.co.uk/media/learning/library/ks2-canal-mania-museum-boat-bessie.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These open "Joey" boats worked short distances carrying bulk cargoes such as coal and iron ore. Although most working boats at the time were wooden, larger firms used riveted iron boats like this one as though more expensive to build they lasted longer. From the 1930s Bessie was used by [[Stewarts &amp; Lloyds]] tube works in [[Halesowen]].

It is now owned by the Black Country Living Museum, where it is based and can be seen dockside in the Lord Ward’s Canal Arm at the museum.

==History==
Horses were key for transport in the [[Black Country]]; they also pulled trams, coaches, milk floats, coal carts, canal boats and fire engines. Industry made the Black Country but horses kept it moving.

[[Horse]]s would have been stabled close to their trade in a yard. The Carters Yard at the Black Country Living Museum is a prime example. The Carters Yard contains a stable carefully dismantled and moved from Burntwood, Cannock. It stood in the backyard of a cottage in Ogley Hay Road and was probably built in 1900. The building was donated to the museum in the 1990s. The stable fittings were from a coach house and stable which was located in Handsworth Wood Road, [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="Carters Yard map" /&gt;

With the advent of the motorcar and petrol engine lorries, horse transport declined. Despite this decline, horses still remained at work well into the twentieth century. Some [[railway]]s, like [[Willenhall]] maintained their horse and waggon deliveries into the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Horses and the ''Titanic'' anchor ==
Up to 20 horses pulled the anchor for the {{RMS|Titanic||2}}. The anchor was made in May 1911 at Noah Hingley’s works in [[Netherton, West Midlands|Netherton]]. The anchor, weighed 16 tons, and was delivered to the railway yard at Netherton from where it was to continue the rest of its journey to the shipyards in Belfast.  Hingley’s used 6 of its own horses - massive animals weighing over a ton in weight the equivalent to a [[shire horse]]. The anchor is still attached to the wrecked ship under the sea.&lt;ref name="Carters Yard factsheet" &gt;{{cite web

{{italic title}}
'''''Brut y Tywysogion''''' ({{lang-en|Chronicle of the Princes}}), also known as '''''Brut y Tywysogyon''''', is one of the most important [[primary source]]s for [[History of Wales|Welsh history]]. It is an [[annals|annalistic]] [[chronicle]] that serves as a continuation of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]’s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''. ''Brut y Tywysogion'' has survived as several [[Welsh language|Welsh]] translations of an original [[Latin]] version, which has not itself survived. The most important versions are the one in [[Robert Vaughan (antiquary)|Robert Vaughan]]'s [[:Category:Peniarth collection|Peniarth]] MS. 20 and the slightly less complete one in the [[Red Book of Hergest]]. The version entitled ''[[Brenhinoedd y Saeson]]'' (''Kings of the English'') combines material from the Welsh annals with material from an English source.

The Peniarth MS. 20 version begins in 682 with a record of the death of [[Cadwaladr]] and ends in 1332. The entries for the earlier years are brief, usually records of deaths and events such as eclipses, plagues or earthquakes, but later entries give much more detail. The main focus is on the rulers of the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]], [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] and [[Deheubarth]], but ecclesiastical events are also mentioned, such as the bringing of the date of celebrating [[Easter]] in the [[Celtic Christianity|Welsh church]] into line with Rome by "Elbodius" ([[Elfodd]]), [[Bishop of Bangor]], in 768. Events in England, Ireland, Scotland and sometimes France are also briefly chronicled.

The original [[monasticism|monastic]] annals are thought to have been written at [[Strata Florida Abbey]], but may have been kept at the old abbey at [[Llanbadarn Fawr, Ceredigion|Llanbadarn Fawr]] in the 11th century. Annals from other abbeys were also used in the composition. At least one of the Welsh translations is also thought to have been written at Strata Florida.

A [[museum]] is distinguished by a '''collection''' of often unique objects that forms the core of its activities for [[wikt:exhibition|exhibitions]], [[education]], [[research]], etc. This differentiates it from an [[archive]] or [[library]], where the contents may be more paper-based, replaceable and less exhibition oriented, or a [[private collection]] of art formed by an individual, family or institution that may grant no public access. A museum normally has a collecting policy for new acquisitions, so only objects in certain categories and of a certain quality are accepted into the collection.  The process by which an object is formally included in the collection is called ''accessioning'' and each object is given a unique [[Accession number (library science)|accession number]].

Museum collections, and archives in general, are normally catalogued in a [[collection catalogue]], traditionally in a [[card index]], but nowadays in a computerized [[database]]. Transferring collection catalogues onto computer-based media is a major undertaking for most museums. All new acquisitions are normally catalogued on a computer in modern museums, but there is typically a backlog of old catalogue entries to be computerized as time and funding allows.

== Types ==
Museum collections are widely varied. There are collections of [[art]], of scientific specimens, of historic objects, of living zoological specimens and much more. Because there are so many things to collect, most museums have a specific area of specialization. For example, a history museum may only collect objects relevant to a particular county or even a single person, or focus on a type of object such as automobiles or stamps. Art museums may focus on a period, such as modern art, or a region. Very large museums will often have many subcollections, each with its own criteria for collecting. A natural history museum, for example, will have mammals in a separate collection from insects.

Because museums cannot collect everything, each potential new addition must be carefully considered as to its appropriateness for a given museum's defined area of interest.

== Accessioning ==

'''Accessioning''' is the formal, legal process of accepting an object into a museum collection. Because accessioning an object carries an obligation to care for that object in perpetuity, it is a serious decision. While in the past many museums accepted objects with little deliberation, today most museums have accepted the need for formal accessioning procedures and practices. These are typically set out as part of a museum's '''Collections Management Policy''' or CMP.

While each museum has its own procedures for accessioning, in most cases it begins with either an offer from a donor to give an object to a museum, or a recommendation from a [[curator]] to acquire an object through purchase or trade.

Several issues must be considered in the decision to accept an object. Common issues include:

* Is the object relevant to the museum's mission and its scope of collecting, as defined by its governing body?
* Was the object lawfully acquired and if foreign in origin, imported in compliance with international law?
* Does the owner of an object have legal title to the object and therefore the right to transfer it?
* Are there any other parties with an interest in the object (e.g. heirs of a donor, descendant groups for cultural objects, etc.)?
* Is the object encumbered by any legal obligations or constraints (e.g., natural history objects that require special permits)?
* Would the object pose any threats or dangers to other objects or staff?
* Does the museum have the resources to properly care for the object (e.g., appropriate storage space, adequate funding)
* Is the object encumbered by any donor restrictions?

Answering these questions often required investigating an object's '''provenance''', the history of an object from the time it was made.

Many museums will not accession objects that have been acquired illegally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2010/10/20101022140412aidan0.7519953.html#By_James_Cuno|title=Who’s Right? Repatriation of Cultural Property|first=James|last=Cuno|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or where other parties have an interest in the object.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In art museums, special care is given to objects that changed hands in European countries during World War II and archaeological objects unearthed after the 1970 UNESCO Convention covering the transport of cultural property. Other disciplines have different concerns. For example, anthropology museums will pay special attention to Native American objects that may be subject to repatriation, and paleontology museums may look carefully at whether proper permitting procedures were followed when they are offered fossil collections.

While in the past, museums often accepted objects with donor-based restrictions, many museums today ask that gifts be given '''unrestricted'''. Common donor restrictions include requiring that an object always be exhibited, or that a collection stays together. However, such restrictions can prevent museums from changing their exhibits as scholarship evolves and may introduce conservation issues for delicate objects not suited to continued display.

Final decision to accept an object generally lies with the museum's board of trustees. In large museums, a special committee may meet regularly to review potential acquisitions. Once the decision has been made to accept an object, it is formally accessioned through a '''Deed of Gift''' and entered into the museum's catalog records. Each object is given a unique catalog number to identify it. Objects are then packed for appropriate archival storage, or prepared for exhibition or other educational use.

== Care ==
[[File:Visual storage at V&amp;A - 1 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|Visual storage at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], London, England]]
Once accessioned into the collection, museum objects must be appropriately cared for. New objects may be examined by a '''conservator''' and treated for any pre-existing damage. The object is then cataloged by a '''curator''' or other specialist with knowledge of the object's importance and history. The object will then be given an appropriate storage location.

Museum storage conditions are meant to protect the object and to minimize any deterioration. This often means keeping objects in a stable climate, preventing exposure to pests, minimizing any handling, and using only archival materials that will not deteriorate or harm the objects. Object safety also include providing appropriate security, and planning for disasters and other threats, and making sure that museum staff are trained in proper handling procedures.

Different types of objects have different requirements, and many museums have specialized storage areas. For example, framed paintings may be stored in racks in one room while unframed paintings are kept in large drawers in another. Some objects have extremely specialized needs. For example, material from underwater archaeological sites may need to be kept wet, and some very rare and badly deteriorated objects require oxygen-free environments.

At any given time, museums display only a portion of their collections. This is often because exhibition requires much more space than storage, and is impractical for the entire collection to be out. Museums may also contain many duplicate or similar objects and find that a few specimens are better suited to display than others. In addition, certain objects, particularly works on paper and textiles, are damaged by light and must only be displayed for short periods of time.

Museum collections are often made up of a variety of materials in a single collection including, but not limited to: canvas, oil and/or acrylic paints, wood, ivory, paper, bone, leather, and textiles.  The biggest conservation issue for museum collections is the fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature.&lt;ref name="Snyder, Jill 2001"&gt;Snyder, Jill.  Caring for Your Art: A Guide for Artists, Collectors, Galleries, and Institutions.  Allworth Press: New York, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;   Relative Humidity (RH) is a measure of the percentage of saturation of the air.

Temperature is not as important to the life of a work of art, but it is true that chemical reactions occur faster at higher temperatures.  However, a museum must take into account the comfort of its staff and visitors and it has been widely accepted that 68&amp;nbsp;°F-75&amp;nbsp;°F does not cause a lot of problems for most artifacts and is comfortable for most humans.&lt;ref name="Snyder, Jill 2001"/&gt;

It has also been internationally agreed upon that the RH should be set at 50%–55%.&lt;ref&gt;Plenderleith, H.J. and Werner, A.E.A.  The Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art.  Oxford University Press: London, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;   This has become widely accepted because the lower limit was set at 45% since damage to organic materials begin to occur below this point.  The upper limit is placed at 65% because mold flourishes at 70% RH.&lt;ref name="Bachmann, Konstanze 1992"&gt;Bachmann, Konstanze.  Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators. Smithsonian Institution Press: Washington DC, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;   It is also cheaper for most institutions to maintain 50% RH rather than 45% or 60%.&lt;ref name="Lord 1999"&gt;Lord, Gail Dexter and Lord, Barry. [[Lord Cultural Resources|The Manual of Museum Planning]], Second Edition. Altimira Press: Walnut Creek, CA, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;   There is some exception when it comes to tropical climates since the indigenous artifacts are acclimated to RH levels higher than the “museum norm”.&lt;ref name="Lord 1999"/&gt;   Changes can be made to a museum’s RH to accommodate the changing seasons, but they must be made gradually.  Humidity should change in 2% per month increments (an increase in 1&amp;nbsp;°F will affect a decrease of about 2% RH).&lt;ref name="Bachmann, Konstanze 1992"/&gt;

== Deaccessioning ==
{{Main|Deaccessioning (museum)}}
'''Deaccessioning''', the process of disposing, selling or trading objects from a museum collection, is not undertaken lightly in most museums. There are ethical issues to consider since many donors of objects typically expect the museum to care for them in perpetuity. Deaccessioning of an object in a collection may be appropriate if a museum has more than one example of that object and if the object is being transferred to another museum. It may also be appropriate if an object is badly deteriorated or threatening other objects.

The decision to deaccession includes two parts. These are making the decision to deaccession and deciding the method of disposal. Generally, first choice is to transfer an object to another use or division in a museum, such as deaccessioning a duplicate object from a permanent collection into a teaching collection. Second choice is to transfer the object to another institution, generally with local institutions having priority. The [[American Alliance of Museums]] and other regional associations often operate lists or boards to help facilitate such transfers. Last choice is sale on the open market. Open market sales are generally expected to take place at auction rather than through private sale, and are typically most common in art museums due to the high monetary value of art collections.

A controversial example occurred when the last remaining complete [[dodo]] [[taxidermy|mount]] in a museum collection at [[Oxford University]] was deaccessioned due to its deterioration in 1775.&lt;ref name="dodo"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051002/spectrum/nature.htm
|work=[[The Sunday Tribune]]
|title=No longer dead as a dodo
|quote=The only known major remains of the dodo are in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Even here, in the January of 1775, an inspector from the Oxford Museum discovered the only remaining dodo, stuffed and disintegrating, and decided to throw it away. The man in charge of this task saved the head and a foot, that were in good condition, and this is all we have of the dodo bird today.
|date=2005-10-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another case was the sale of a [[J. M. W. Turner]] painting in the collection of [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] to the [[Getty Museum]] to fund the maintenance of the building, despite the fact that the original benefactor had expressly requested that the collection be kept intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Ian|last= MacKinnon|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Getty museum pays pounds 11m for Turner  |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/getty-museum-pays-pounds-11m-for-turner-1474651.html |quote=Last night the sale was condemned by Peter Longman, director of the Museums and Galleries Commission, which advises the Government. 'It is a great pity that they have been allowed to sell it,' he said. 'It is in clear contravention of the donor's intentions and it is an integral part of an important collection.' He said it was particularly sad that the painting was being sold against the benefactor's, wishes with the Government's connivance at a time when it was inviting people to make donations and gifts to galleries. |work=[[The Independent]] |date=February 23, 1993 |accessdate=2009-06-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ethical guidelines for deaccessioning require that the funds generated by disposing of collection items be used only to increase or maintain the remaining collection. For example, the International Council of Museums (ICOM) Code of Ethics states that:

"Money or compensation received from the deaccessioning and disposal of objects and specimens from a museum collection should be used solely for the benefit of the collection and usually for acquisitions to that same collection".&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom.museum/ethics.html#section2 ICOM ''Code of Ethics for Museums, 2006'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], guidelines governing deaccessioning and other ethically difficult issues can be found in the [[Museums Association]]'s ''Code of Ethics''.  In the [[United States]], the guidelines on these matters are issued by the [[American Alliance of Museums]].&lt;ref name="aam-us.org"&gt;[http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/code-of-ethics-for-museums The American Alliance of Museums ''Code of Ethics for Museums'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Alliance of Museums Code of Ethics takes the position that "in no event shall they [deaccessioning proceeds] be used for anything other than acquisition or direct care of collections".&lt;ref name="aam-us.org"/&gt;

Other museums may have additional restrictions on the use of funds from deaccessioning. For example, at some museums funds from deaccessioning a work of art can only be used to purchase a work of similar style or period (for example, funds from selling a 20th-century American print could not be used to buy a 17th-century Italian painting) and the name of the donor of the sold work remains associated with the purchased artwork.

Selling artwork to fund budget deficits and pay salaries is like "burning down your house to heat the kitchen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Deborah Solomon]] |coauthors= |title=Museum Under Fire for Selling Its Art |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/arts/design/censured-delaware-art-museum-plans-to-divest-more-works.html?|quote=Selling artwork to fund operations (as opposed to acquisitions) is widely viewed as self-defeating, like burning down your house to heat the kitchen. Museums are supposed to safeguard art for future generations, not cash in or out. ... |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= August 7, 2014|accessdate=2014-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article focuses on [[iPod]] [[file manager]]s. i.e. software that permits the transferring of [[media file]]s content between an iPod and a computer or vice versa.

[[iTunes]] is the official iPod managing software, but 3rd parties have created alternatives to work around restrictions in iTunes. e.g. transferring content from an iPod to a computer is restricted by iTunes.

'''''Demons''''' ({{lang-it|Dèmoni}})  is a 1985 Italian  [[Action film|action-]][[horror film]] directed by [[Lamberto Bava]] and produced by [[Dario Argento]], starring [[Urbano Barberini]] and [[Natasha Hovey]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Demoni (1985) SCREEN: 'DEMONS,' BY BAVA|first=Walter|last=Goodman|date=May 31, 1986|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DEFD71E3EF932A05756C0A960948260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay was written by Bava, Argento, [[Franco Ferrini]] and [[Dardano Sacchetti]], from a story by Sacchetti. Filming took place in [[Berlin]] and [[Rome]].

The film was followed up by seven [[sequel]]s (most of which are in-name only), beginning with ''[[Demons 2]]'' in 1986.

==Plot==
On the [[Berlin subway]], university student Cheryl gets off at her stop in the deserted subway station and is pursued by a mysterious, masked man. Rather than attacking her, the man offers her tickets to a free screening at the Metropol, an isolated and recently renovated local cinema. Cheryl talks her friend Kathy into going with her and they skip class to go see the film. At the crowded theater, they meet two preppy college boys, George and Ken, who take an immediate liking to the girls and help them get a can of cola out of the vending machine. The four sit together in the theater.

There are many people from all walks of life in the audience; a blind man and his guide daughter, a married couple, a boyfriend and girlfriend, and a pimp named Tony along with his two prostitutes who look at the theater's display props in the foyer. One of the prostitutes, Rosemary, scratches her face with a bizarre display mask before they go in to watch the film. The film being shown is a violent, disturbing horror film which features a look-alike of the mask from the lobby; it is about four teenagers who discover an old tomb and dig up the grave of a sixteenth-century fortune teller called [[Nostradamus]]. When the teenagers dig up Nostradamus's coffin, they find no body and instead an old book and a mask identical to the strange mask in the foyer. When one of the movie's characters puts the mask on and is scratched by it just like Rosemary was by its doppelganger, he then turns evil and slaughters his friends with a kitchen knife.

Rosemary feels ill and goes to the bathroom, where the scratch on her face bursts open and spews out pus, she then transforms into a bloodthirsty, red-eyed demon like the one in the film. Rosemary attacks her friend, Carmen, who then rips through the screen and transforms into a demon in front of the rest of the cinema-goers. The group of uninfected people race to any exit they can find, only to find that they have all been bricked up making escape impossible. Although they attempt to barricade themselves in the balcony, many are attacked and infected by the demons. One of the demons escapes into the city when four [[Punk subculture|punk]]s break into the building through a back entrance; the punks are soon transformed into demons as well.

In the cinema, only George and Cheryl remain uninfected. Using a display motorcycle and sword props from the foyer, they ride through the auditorium, slicing down many demons. George kills nearly all of them when suddenly, a helicopter crashes through the roof. George and Cheryl use an emergency grappling hook and winch to climb to the roof, where they are attacked by the mysterious man from the subway. They are able to kill him by impaling his head on an exposed bit of [[rebar]]. The two climb down to the street and discover that the demonic infection has spread throughout Berlin. They are then chased by a horde of demons before being picked up by a jeep of well-armed survivors (a father and his two children) and they make their escape. As they drive out of the city to safety, (during the end credits) Cheryl (having been infected at some point in the theater) transforms into a demon and before she can harm George, Cheryl is shot by one of the other passengers (Kirk), having her body fall out of the jeep and onto the road. With George being the cinema's last survivor, he escapes with the family in the jeep into a distant unknown future.

==Production==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
[[Dario Argento]] had an important influence on ''Dèmoni''. In addition to co-writing the script, he also produced the film. Argento's daughter, Fiore, plays the character of Hannah. [[Michele Soavi]], a devotee of Argento's work and his assistant director on several films, also served as an assistant director on ''Dèmoni'' and has two starring roles, as the man wearing the silver mask and as Jerry, one of the characters in the film playing at the Metropol. [[Nicoletta Elmi]], who plays the usherette, appeared in Argento's 1975 classic [[giallo]] ''[[Deep Red]]'', and she also had a small role in the 1971 horror film ''[[Twitch of the Death Nerve]]'' (directed by [[Mario Bava]], the father of ''Dèmoni'' director Lamberto Bava).

Most of the interior cinema scenes were shot in an actual closed down movie theatre. The building still exists but is now a bank. At the same time, the building used for the exterior shots of the movie theatre still exists; it's a club called "Goya", whose appearance in the film has brought it fame and regularly hosts horror conventions today. Filming took place in Germany and Italy, and as a reference to these countries' cinema, posters for [[Werner Herzog]]'s ''[[Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht]]'' and Argento's ''[[Four Flies on Grey Velvet]]'' can be seen hanging in the Metropol's lobby.

'''EMVA1288'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standard1288.org/ Official website of the EMVA1288 standard]&lt;/ref&gt; is an electronic measurement standard developed by the European Machine Vision Association (EMVA). Its purpose is to define the methods to measure and characterize [[image sensors]] and cameras that are used in machine vision. It also provides rules and guidelines on how to report results and how to write device datasheets.

The main goal of the standard is to characterize industrial cameras. Therefore, photography and television standards are not applicable. It was necessary to define a new standard specific to machine vision applications.

The standard is free to use and free to download but the user must register to EMVA to have the right to use the "EMVA1288 compliant" logo on their publications or products.

== History ==

Work on the 1288 standard started in 2004. Release 1 for monochrome cameras was released in August 2005. In Release A2.01&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emva.org/wp-content/uploads/emva_1288_rela2.01_official.pdf EMVA1288 standard Release A2.01]&lt;/ref&gt;, issued in August 2007 included an additional linearity module. With Release 3&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emva.org/wp-content/uploads/EMVA1288-3.0.pdf EMVA1288 standard Release 3.0]&lt;/ref&gt;,  published on November 2010 the first version was available that covered monochrome and color cameras as well as area and line cameras together with a characterization of defect pixels.
Release 3.1&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emva.org/wp-content/uploads/EMVA1288-3.1a.pdf EMVA1288 standard Release 3.1]&lt;/ref&gt; came into effect on December 30, 2016&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emva.org/news/emva-1288-release-3-1-is-effective/ EMVA news, January 11, 2107]&lt;/ref&gt;. This release contains only a few refinements and additions. Its major new feature is a standardized summary datasheet making camera comparison even easier. The most important refinement is a definition of the camera signal nonlinearity better adapted to cameras with a higher dynamic range. The only two other major additions are: a) the total SNR curve which includes the spatial nonuniformities, and b) diagrams of horizontal and vertical profiles for a meaningful and well-arranged characterization of the different types of the spatial nonuniformities.

The standardization committee was chaired by Martin Wäny from Awaiba until 2007. Since 2008 the chair is Bernd Jähne, HCI, Heidelberg University.

== Principles ==

=== Main principles ===

The standard only uses [[radiometry|radiometric]] units like [[watt]]s, [[joules]], number of [[photon]]s, [[volts]], etc. There is no use of [[photometry (optics)|photometric]] units like [[lux]].

The 1288 standard is based on a linear camera model. All noise sources except for photon noise and quantization noise can be included into a single parameter, the variance of the dark noise. Thus the model contains only three basic unknowns: the quantum efficiency, the dark noise and the system gain.

The standard is made of various modules. Some modules being mandatory, others being optional. For each module, a simple mathematical model of the phenomenon or parameter to be described is built. Then, a method to acquire specific image data is defined. Finally, out of the measured data, the parameter is computed using simple formulas.

=== Response method ===

The response is a plot of the camera's output (in digital numbers) versus the impinging light (as amount of photons). The slope of this plot is the response of the camera. The deviation from an ideal straight line is a measurement of the non-linearity of the camera.

=== Photon transfer method ===

The photon transfer is a plot of the variance of the camera's output (in digital numbers squared) versus the output of the camera for the same amount of impinging photons (in digital numbers). The maximum of this curve defines the saturation capacity. The leftmost point defines the dark noise and the slope defines the noise caused by the light itself.

== Summary data sheet ==

The summary data sheet contains three major elements:

=== Operating point === 

Contains a complete description of the settings of the operating point at which the EMVA 1288 measurements have been acquired. Settings not specified are assumed to be in the factory default mode. This ensures that the measurements can be repeated anytime under the same conditions.

=== Photon Transfer Curve and SNR Curve ===

The photon transfer curve shows the variance of the image sensor noise versus the mean value. For an ideal linear camera this curve should be linear. Only if the lower 70% of the curve are linear, can the EMVA 1288 performance parameters be estimated accurately. If a camera has any type of deficiencies, these can often first seen in the photon transfer curve.
The double-logarithmic SNR curve [2b] is a nice overall graphical representation of all camera performance parameters except for the dark current. The absolute sensitivity threshold is marked as well as the saturation capacity.
In addition, the maximum signal-to-noise ratio and the dynamic range can be read from the graph. The total SNR is plotted as a dashed line. It includes both the variances from the temporal noise and the nonuniformities. If this line lies recognizably below the solid line of the SNR curve, nonuniformities significantly reduce the performance of the camera.

=== EMVA 1288 Performance Parameters ===

This column lists all EMVA 1288 performance parameters.

== EMVA1288 Compliance ==
If EMVA standard 1288 compliant data are published or provided to a customer or any third party the full data sheet must be provided. An EMVA 1288 compliant data sheet must contain all mandatory measurements and graphs as specified in the standard document for release 3.1&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emva.org/wp-content/uploads/EMVA1288-3.1a.pdf EMVA1288 standard Release 3.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''farm museum''', or '''museum farm''', is a [[museum]] based on a historical [[farm]] and its buildings, presenting [[Agriculture|agricultural]] history. Often the farm is still a working farm, for demonstration and educational purposes.

See [[List of open-air and living history museums in the United States]] for a list of such farms in the U.S., or [[Open-air museum]] for farms in other countries.

'''Francis Andrew March''' (October 25, 1825 – September 9, 1911), was an [[United States|American]] [[polymath]], academic, [[philologists|philologist]], and [[lexicography|lexicographer]]. He is considered the principal founder of modern [[comparative linguistics]] in [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]].

Also known as the "Grand Old Man of Lafayette,"&lt;ref name="DRMarchDeath"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dr. F. A. March's Death |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KcChc5dOQ84J:digital.lafayette.edu/collections/newspaper/19110926/pdf+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari |accessdate=30 October 2018 |work=The Lafayette Weekly |issue=Vol. 38, No. 1 |date=September 26, 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; March was the first individual to hold the title "Professor of English Language and Literature" anywhere in the United States or Europe. March is predominantly recognized for performing his duties as "Professor of the English Language and Comparative Philology" at [[Lafayette College]], where he taught for fifty-six years.&lt;ref name="Sketch" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
=== Early life and education ===
March was born on October 25, 1825, in [[Millbury, Massachusetts]] (formerly Sutton). Three years later, his family relocated to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. As a child, he was educated in the Worcester public school system. March recalled being grateful for the education he received in the district, explaining his kindergarten teacher "made the children understand many things before the usual time."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/456758|title=An Address in Commemoration of Francis Andrew March, 1825–1911|first=James Wilson|last=Bright|date=24 October 2018|publisher=|journal=PMLA|volume=28|pages=cxvii–cxxxvii|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prepared him high school, where March became a clever and active participant in his classes and activities. He became a writer, read on a wide range of subjects, performed in school plays, and even wrote plays himself.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

At the age of 15, March was ready for college, but his father experienced business troubles which hindered March's ability to afford tuition. The Honorable Alfred D. Foster of Worcester, however, offered to fund a portion of his education at [[Amherst College]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; During his time in college, March maintained prominence in scholarship as well as in athletics. He graduated in 1845 as valedictorian and as a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; He also received an M.A. degree from Amherst in 1848, with an oration on "Relation of the Study of Jurisprudence to the Baconian Philosophy."&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Family life ===
March married Margaret Mildred Stone Conway (1837–1911) on August 12, 1860. Together they had nine children: historian Francis Andrew March Jr., Peyton C. March, Thomas Stone March, Alden March, Moncure March, John Lewis March, Mildred March, Margaret D. March, and General [[Peyton C. March]].&lt;ref name="Sketch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="geni.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Francis-Andrew-March/6000000006797256009|title=Francis Andrew March|website=geni_family_tree}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis A. March Jr. later worked at Lafayette College as a professor and became the namesake for Lafayette College's March Field.&lt;ref name="lafayette.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.lafayette.edu/buildings/|title=Historical Survey of the  Buildings of Lafayette College|website=sites.lafayette.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Peyton C. March was chief of staff of the United States Army during the [[First World War]]. Meanwhile, Thomas Stone March became a superintendent of schools in Greensburg, Pennsylvania; Alden March became a Sunday editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'';and John Lewis March became a professor of modern languages at [[Union College]] in Schenectady, New York.

=== Death ===
[[File:March's Gravestone.jpg|thumb|March's burial site in Easton, PA]]
Francis A. March died on a Saturday afternoon on September 9, 1911 at the age of 86 in his home on Lafayette College's campus.&lt;ref name="DRMarchDeath" /&gt; He is buried in Easton Cemetery in [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Francis Andrew March |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11293939/francis-andrew-march |publisher=Find A Grave |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 30, 1913 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, his colleague, Professor [[James Bright]], delivered a commemoration in his honor at the Joint Session of the [[American Philological Association]] and the [[Modern Language Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/456758|title=An Address in Commemoration of Francis Andrew March, 1825–1911|first=James Wilson|last=Bright|date=26 October 2018|publisher=|journal=PMLA|volume=28|pages=cxvii–cxxxvii|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Immediately following his graduation from Amherst, March began teaching at an academy in [[Swanzey, New Hampshire]]. He then taught for two years at Leicester Academy, where he began formulating his plan to teach English and literature. From 1847 to 1848, he was a tutor at his alma mater.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

March also expressed an interest in law. In 1849, he entered as a law student for the office of Barney and Butler. A year later, March was admitted to the New York bar. He began practicing the profession with partner Gordon L. Ford Esq. However, in 1852, March experienced severe health issues. He suffered a hemorrhage of the lungs and was rushed to Cuba in an attempt to alleviate the problem, given Cuba's gentler climate. The climate aided March's health and allowed him to resume work the following year, in which he secured a position teaching law at a private academy in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] for three years.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Lafayette College ===
After studying law and teaching, March became an English tutor at Lafayette College in 1856, appointed by the college's new president [[George Wilson McPhail]]. He worked for one year as a tutor and then became a professor of English Language and Comparative Philology from 1857 to 1907. Lafayette was the first college in the world to have the [[philology]] of the English language studied – a course all American colleges soon thereafter incorporated into their own curricula.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlueter|first=June|date=1990|title=Francis A.

March had a significant career at Lafayette College and remained loyal to the school, often turning down offers from larger universities as his published work and teaching style became more well-known. March helped improve Lafayette by using his wisdom and insight to bring the college to a new stage of prestigious education. He was devoted to both increasing the analysis of English literature in higher institutions, as well as in growing the college's academics. In addition to English, March also taught French, German, Greek, Latin, [[botany]], "[[Philosophy of mind|mental philosophy]]", [[political economy]], critical examination of the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]], [[public law]] and [[Roman law]].

March brought a new outlook to teaching English by introducing a detailed examination of linguistic and rhetorical pieces. By applying the methods of studying Latin and Greek classics towards the study of [[English literature]], he led the way for the first scientific study of the English language. March is also said to be the first person to include one of Shakespeare's plays on his course syllabus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; March had a pedagogical philosophy and unique approach to the systematic study of the English language. His outlook was “the greatest pioneering step ever made in the realm of scholarship by Lafayette College."&lt;ref name="Sketch" /&gt; One of his most distinct analytical contributions was his philology-across-the-curriculum approach in which "professors train the students in each department to write on subjects connected with it in the words and phrases current among experts." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

March had a son who also became an English professor at Lafayette and they worked alongside each other. By dedicating most of his life to Lafayette College, the ideas that Francis A. March presented about systematic study became a part of the college's philosophy of education that still holds to this day.

=== Academic interests ===
==== Philology ====
Outside of teaching, Francis A. March contributed to many advancements in [[philology]]. He contributed to over 200 periodical publications in philology, the historical study of grammar, the teaching of literature, and [[pedagogy]].&lt;ref name="Sketch" /&gt; In addition, he published four volumes of Latin and Greek classics. In 1869, he published what is considered to be his masterpiece, “A Comparative Grammar of the Anglo-Saxon Language.”&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; This work gained him recognition as a distinguished scholar in the philological world. From 1873 to 1874, and again from 1895 to 1896, he served as the president of the [[American Philological Association]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Later, in 1903 he published "A Thesaurus Dictionary of the English Language." &lt;ref name="Sketch" /&gt;

==== Spelling reform ====
March was one of the chief reformers in the spelling of English words. He believed in simpler spellings. In his writings, he often spelled words phonetically to emphasize his passion for spelling reform. In 1876, he became the permanent President of the Spelling Reform Association. He remained president until 1906.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

==== Lexicography ====
March also pursued an interest in Lexicography. This may have stemmed from his connection with [[Noah Webster]]. March initially heard Webster speak while he was a student at [[Amherst College]]. He also studied under Webster's son-in-law, [[William Chauncey Fowler]]. Webster's Dictionary also had a strong impact on March.&lt;ref name="Schlueter 2005"/&gt; March aligned with the premise that spelling, grammar, and usage should be based on the spoken word. March was the first American superintendent over the volunteer reading program of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', thus providing valuable support to [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]] in the compilation of this monumental work.&lt;ref name="Schlueter 2005"/&gt; He also served as the consulting editor of [[Funk and Wagnalls]]' Standard Dictionary from 1879 to 1892.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[File:March Elementary.jpg|thumb|Francis A. March Elementary School, of the Easton Area School District]]
March left an impactful and lasting legacy on the Lafayette College and Easton-area communities, as well as on the broader academic community.

March worked at Lafayette College for more than fifty years,&lt;ref name="Sketch"&gt;{{cite book |title=Francis A. March Collection: Biographical Sketch |date=October 2015 |publisher=Lafayette College |url=https://archives.lafayette.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/march.pdf |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; passing up opportunities at other institutions&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; in order to continue to study, teach, and publish at the small liberal arts school. While praised for his hard work, March was also remembered for being the first academic in the country to study and teach English texts in the same manner professors taught Greek and Latin classics. His examination of the English language led Lafayette College to set up the first chair at any college in the United States for the study of English texts from a modern viewpoint.&lt;ref name="Sketch" /&gt; To this day, Lafayette College has a chaired professorship in March's honor.&lt;ref name="geni.com" /&gt; Lafayette College also has a Francis A. March Fellowship that is awarded to a senior who has excelled in the English department and has been accepted into a graduate school approved by the college's English department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.lafayette.edu/en/current/Catalog/Academic-Programs/Honors/Prizes-and-Awards/Francis-A-March-Fellowship|title=Lafayette College&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Francis A. March Fellowship:|website=catalog.lafayette.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond his professional impact, colleague James A. Bright, also commented on how March personally shaped the Lafayette College community. Bright spoke highly of the way in which March built relationships with faculty and served as a mentor to students.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

March's lasting legacy can also be seen in the wider Easton-area community, where an elementary school is named in his honor. Francis A. March Elementary School in the [[College Hill Residential Historic District]] is part of the [[Easton Area School District]], which serves Northampton County.&lt;ref name="geni.com" /&gt;

The wider academic community has also recognized the value of March's contributions and work. Each year, the Modern Language Association gives two distinguished scholar-teachers awards named after Francis A. March.&lt;ref name="Sketch" /&gt; Additionally, the [[Association of Departments of English]] has established the Francis Andrew March Award to recognize and honor scholars who have made paramount contributions to the study of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ade.mla.org/About/The-ADE-Francis-Andrew-March-Award|title=The ADE Francis Andrew March Award|website=Modern Language Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements and honorary degrees ==
Francis A. March's monumental works have been highly recognized in academia. March was the first to hold the title of “Professor of English Language and Literature” in both the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="Sketch" /&gt; This appointment was "the greatest pioneering step ever made in the realm of scholarship by Lafayette College," as described in the Skillman biography of the college.&lt;ref name="Sketch" /&gt;

He was elected President of the Modern Language Association from 1891 to 1893, President of the American Philological Association from 1873 to 1893 and 1895 to 1896, President of the Spelling Reform Association of 1876 to 1905, and was the Vice President of London's New Shakespeare Society.&lt;ref name="Sketch" /&gt;

March was also the first American member of London's [[Philosophical Society]] and Paris's L’Association Fonetique de Professeurs de Langues Vivants.&lt;ref name="Sketch" /&gt;

On October 21, 1881, March was elected into the [[American Antiquarian Society]]. Members are elected by their colleagues for their tremendous contributions and discoveries within academia.&lt;ref name="Sketch" /&gt;

During his fifty-six-year career at Lafayette College, March received several honorary degrees from world-renowned academic institutions. In 1870, [[Princeton University]] awarded March with the degree of [[Legum Doctor]] (LL.D). In 1887, [[Columbia University]] commemorated March with the degree of [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] (D.H.L.).

In 1896, he was awarded both the degree of [[Doctor of Civil Law]] (D.C.L.) from the [[University of Oxford]], as well as the degree of [[Doctor of Letters]] (Litt.D) from the [[University of Cambridge]]. At this time, March was one of only six people to ever be honored with such prestigious accolades by these universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medical Review |date=1896 |publisher=St. Louis Medical Review Association. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVXlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA35&amp;lpg=RA2-PA35&amp;dq=%22francis+a+march%22+%22honorary+degree%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DW-TnezX_9&amp;sig=0KWKejuJkwv7Hez0av3caWCq-7g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiyz4Hv95zeAhVBvFkKHVmfAyIQ6AEwAnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22francis%20a%20march%22%20%22honorary%20degree%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HD Tach''' is a software program for [[Microsoft Windows]] (2000 or XP) that tests and graphs the sequential read, [[random access]] and interface [[burst transmission|burst]] speeds of attached storage devices ([[hard drive]], [[Solid-state drive|flash drive]], [[removable drive]] etc.). Drive technologies such as [[SCSI]], [[AT Attachment|IDE/ATA]], [[IEEE 1394]], [[USB]], [[SATA]] and [[RAID]] are supported.

A prominent feature of the software was an included library of drive benchmarks, as well as the option to save your own drive's benchmarks locally or submit them to an online database. The company's website also had a forum with over 2000 user posts. &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727101007/http://www.simplisoftware.com/Forums/ http://www.simplisoftware.com/Forums/ snapshot at archive.org, July 27, 2011] &lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2011, citing the lack of time to devote to the project, Simpli Software formally announced on its website that HD Tach had reached end-of-life and was no longer being supported.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121114062348/http://www.simplisoftware.com/ HD Tach End-of-Life Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; The domain has since expired.

The latest version of this application (3.0.4.0) is not fully compatible with [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], or [[Windows 8]]. However, HD Tach works in these operating systems by running it in [[Windows XP]] SP2 or SP3 compatibility mode. HD Tach 2.70 is the last version to work on Windows NT 4.0. 


== History ==
HD Tach was originally developed by [[TCD Labs, Inc.]] In 2000 the company was acquired by [[Oak Technology, Inc.]] [[Simpli Software, Inc.]] was formed by the original group of TCD Labs employees and acquired all rights to the benchmarks and source code from Oak Technology in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.price.ro/forum/showthread.php?t=9563#post133097 HD Tach 3.00 readme file]&lt;/ref&gt; The domain name displayed in the software, simplisoftware.com, began resolving to a domain reseller landing page in November 2012.

'''''Heimkommen''''' (Homecoming) and the related [[hashtag]] '''#heimkommen''' is a German commercial video for the supermarket corporation [[Edeka]] that [[viral video|went viral]] in November and December 2015.

In the commercial, [[Arthur Nightingale]] plays a German grandfather faking his own death to reunite his family on Christmas.&lt;ref name="Tagesspiegel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt" /&gt;

== Video ==
The 1:46-minute commercial shows a well-to-do grandfather receiving messages over the years from his successful children around the world, who call off family get-togethers at Christmas time. Each year he eats his Christmas dinner by himself. Eventually he fakes his own death, and his grieving children and grandchildren travel to his home, only to find him still alive. He tells them, "I had no other way to bring you together". After the family unites in a joyful Christmas dinner, the final shot shows the Edeka logo.&lt;ref name=clip/&gt;

'''John Joseph Albright''' (1 January 1848 [[Buchanan, Virginia]] – 20 August 1931 [[Buffalo, New York]]) was a businessman, philanthropist, and one of Buffalo's leading socialites at the turn of the 20th century.

==Early life==
Albright was born on January 18, 1848, in [[Buchanan, Virginia]], to Joseph Jacob Albright and Elizabeth S. Albright, both from Pennsylvania. The family was descended from Andrew Albright, a gunsmith who supplied arms to the troops of the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], who had come to America in 1750.&lt;ref name="The Jekyll Island Cottage Colony"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCash|first1=June Hall|title=The Jekyll Island Cottage Colony|date=1998|publisher=University of Georgia Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GumIp_e6jWQC&amp;pg=PA189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albright's father, Joseph, was an iron manufacturer and eventually, President of the [[First National Bank (Philadelphia)|First National Bank]], coal agent for [[Delaware and Hudson Railway|Delaware and Hudson Canal Company]], and the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]].&lt;ref name="The Jekyll Island Cottage Colony"/&gt;

His family lived in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] when he was a child and he attended public schools in Scranton, then [[Williston Northampton School|Williston Academy]] in [[Massachusetts]], ultimately graduating from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Troy, New York]] with a degree in [[Mining Engineering]] in 1868.&lt;ref name="Nardin Academy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Betsy|title=The Ivy Grows Again: A History of the Albright Estate from 1890 to the Present|date=1998|publisher=Nardin Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Albright &amp; Company.jpg|thumb|left|Albright &amp; Company Ad from 1890.]] Following his graduation from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], Albright returned to Scranton.  At that time, coal was in high demand in the [[Western United States]], and Albright got involved in its sale.  By 1871, Albright was working out of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] selling coal wholesale, along with his business partner, [[Andrew Langdon]] (1835-1919). Their firm was called Langdon, Albright and Company.  By 1873, Albright had married Langdon's sister, Harriet, and they all moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], where Albright and Langdon started to work for the [[Reading Anthracite Company|Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company]].&lt;ref name="Nardin Academy"/&gt;

While in Washington, Albright started an [[asphalt]] business with his brother-in-law, [[Amzi L. Barber]] (who had married his wife's sister, Julia Louise Langdon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamb|first1=Daniel Smith|title=A Historical, Biographical and Statistical Souvenir|date=1900|publisher=Howard University. Medical Dept.|location=Beresford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_gaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA86|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together Barber and Albright participated in the paving of [[Washington, DC|Washington]], [[Scranton]], and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. While Albright turned to other ventures, Barber continued with the [[asphalt]] business and secured a 42-year [[monopoly]] concession from the [[British Government]] for the [[Pitch Lake]] in [[Trinidad]], the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world. Barber used the asphalt from [[Trinidad]] for paving city streets and by 1900, Barber had laid over 12 million square yards of [[Trinidad]] [[asphalt]] pavement in 70 American cities at a cost of $35 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamb|first1=Daniel Smith|title=A Historical, Biographical and Statistical Souvenir|date=1900|publisher=Howard University Medical Department|location=Beresford|pages=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_gaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA86|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, the [[Reading Company|Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company]] tightened its shipping routes and started shipping [[coal]] directly by rail through [[Buffalo, New York]] to ship their coal to the west.  Albright moved his family to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] to oversee the operations. While there, he entered into partnership with [[Thomas Guilford Smith]], another [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|RPI]] graduate and Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company executive.&lt;ref name="Buffalo Evening News"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the City of Buffalo: Its Men and Institutions : Biographical Sketches of Leading Citizens|date=1908|publisher=Buffalo Evening News|location=Buffalo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S09KAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=Moses%2520Taylor%2520marine%2520bank&amp;dq=Moses+Taylor+marine+bank&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their firm, Albright &amp; Smith, handled all of Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company's coal sales in [[Canada]] and [[Western New York]], as well as all the Railroad's coal going westward from Buffalo. Albright devised a plan to fill up the empty trains with grain on the haul back to the East. Purportedly, within a year, he had earned $100,000 ({{Inflation|US|100000|1869|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name="marktwainproject.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=SLC to Joseph J. Albright, 17 July 1874|url=http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=letters/UCCL01112.xml;style=letter;brand=mtp|website=marktwainproject.org|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1888, Albright had done so well that he decided to retire and took his family on a 14-month tour of Europe and Egypt when he was only 40 years old. Albright, however, tired of retirement and started working again upon his return.&lt;ref name="The Jekyll Island Cottage Colony"/&gt;  By 1889, Albright's business partner, [[Thomas Guildford Smith|Smith]] had become a sales agent for [[Thomas M. Carnegie|Carnegie, Phipps &amp; Company Limited]] which later merged with The [[Carnegie Steel Company]], of which Smith was its Buffalo representative.&lt;ref name="Buffalo Evening News"/&gt;

===Ontario Power Company===
In 1890 the US [[Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company]] and its subsidiary Cataract Company formed the International Niagara Commission composed of experts, to analyze proposals to harness [[Niagara Falls]] on the US/Canada border to generate power. They settled electricity ([[alternating current]]) as being the preferred transmission method and, after going through many proposals, in 1893 they awarded the generating contract to [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] with further transmission lines and transformer contracts awarded to [[General Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert L.

A similar set of events were happening on the Canadian side of the falls. In June 1887, recognizing an opportunity, the [[Ontario Hydro|Ontario Power Company]] of Niagara Falls was incorporated in Canada "to supply manufacturers, corporations, and persons with water, hydraulic, electric or other power." While its operations were in [[Queen Victoria Park]] in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], its executive office was in Buffalo with the following officers: Albright, president; [[Francis Vinton Greene|Francis V. Greene]], vice-president; and Robert C. Board, [[Corporate Secretary|secretary]] and treasurer.&lt;ref name="Buffalo Evening News"/&gt;

In 1903, the Company obtained an agreement with the Commissioners of the [[Queen Victoria Park|Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park]] that allowed the company to develop at least 180,000 [[horsepower]] of [[electricity]]. The company built its [[hydroelectric]] [[generating plant]], which opened in 1905, at the base of the [[Horseshoe Falls]] just above river level.  The plant had 15 generators which produced 203,000 horsepower of [[electric power]].&lt;ref name="The Ontario Power Company"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ontario Power Company|url=http://www.niagarafallsinfo.com/history-item.php?entry_id=1441&amp;current_category_id=248|website=niagarafallsinfo.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, Albright hired Buffalo [[architect]] [[Edward Brodhead Green|E. B. Green]] to design the ''Ontario Power Company'' buildings, Murray Street at Buchanan Avenue, including the Entrance Pavilion, Spillway Building, Office &amp; Transformer Station, Gate House, Screen House, and ‘’Ontario Power Company Generating Station" at river level.&lt;ref name="Buffalo Evening News"/&gt;

The [[hydroelectric]] [[generating plant]] worked by allowing water to enter the generating station from an [[inlet]] located one mile upstream of [[Niagara Falls]], near [[Dufferin Islands]], and was then brought to the plant through buried conduit pipes and steel [[penstock]]s tunneled through the rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontario Power Company|url=http://www.niagarafrontier.com/power.html#Ontpower|website=niagarafrontier.com|publisher=Niagara Falls (Ontario) Public Library|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conduits, two steel and one wooden (bound with iron hoops and encased in cement), ran underground 6,180 feet (1,884 meters) to the top of the generating station. There, each conduit connected with six [[penstock]]s, six feet in diameter. At the point where the conduits and the penstocks join, there was a section which turned upwards into a [[spillway]], called a [[surge tank]].  The [[surge tank]]s served to reduce fluctuations in heat and pressure during both the increase and decrease of loads. The open spillways sent any excess water to the [[Niagara River]] if the load suddenly reduced, which prevented any unwanted rise in pressure.&lt;ref name="Buffalo Evening News"/&gt;

From the distributing station, the [[transmission line]]s carried power at 60,000 [[volt]]s each with a capacity of 40,000 [[kilowatt]]s, running over a right of way that was 300 feet wide and 32,000 feet long. This ran north to an area down the [[Niagara River]] known as [[Devil's Hole State Park|Devil's Hole]], where they then crossed the [[Niagara River]] into [[New York State]] across a 1,300 feet long span. In addition to the high tension [[Electric power distribution|feeders]], there were approximately 30 miles of lines serving [[Canada|Canadian]] customers at generator voltage.&lt;ref name="Buffalo Evening News"/&gt;

The power that was transmitted to [[New York State]] was then sold in bulk to [[The Niagara Lockport and Ontario Power Company|Niagara Lockport and Ontario Power Company]], a New York company, which was then distributed to individual customers.  The largest individual consumers of power from these lines included several entities with direct ties to Albright: The [[Lackawanna Steel Company]], [[Empire State Railway]], [[New York Central Railroad]], the [[Shenandoah Steel Wire Company]], the [[Syracuse Consolidated Street Railway|Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway Company]], the [[Lockport Gas and Electric Light Company]], the [[Auburn Light Heat and Power Company]], the [[Erie Railroad|Erie Railroad Company]], and the [[Genesee County Electric Light Power and Gas Company]].&lt;ref name="Buffalo Evening News"/&gt;

The plant continued to operate until 1999 when the [[Ontario Power Generation]] (formerly [[Ontario Hydro]]) decommissioned the Ontario Power Company Generating Station from service in order to accommodate the construction of [[Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort]], built on the former transformer building location. As of 2015, the 1905 remaining Generating Station is owned by the [[Niagara Parks Commission]], and sits abandoned.&lt;ref name="The Ontario Power Company"/&gt;

===Niagara, Lockport and Ontario Power Company===
In 1905, a syndicate headed by Albright and [[Henry Herman Westinghouse]] (brother of [[George Westinghouse]]) acquired control [[Niagara, Lockport and Ontario Power Company]] from [[Washington Savings Bank (New York)|Joseph G. Robin]] and his associates.  The purchasing syndicate included: Albright, Westinghouse, [[New York Central]], [[William Henry Vanderbilt|Vanderbilt interests]], and Horace E. Andrews, of [[Cleveland]] (president of the [[New York State Railways]], the [[New York State Railways|Mohawk Valley Company]], the Rochester Railway &amp; Light Company, director of the [[Russell, Ontario|New York Central Railway]], the [[Michigan Central Railway]], [[Ontario West Shore Railway|West Shore Railway]], [[New York State Railways|Schenectady Railway Company]], Havana Railway, [[Toronto and Scarboro' Electric Railway, Light and Power Company|Light &amp; Power Company]]), among others.&lt;ref name="Buffalo Evening News"/&gt;

[[File:Niagara, Lockport and Ontario Power.gif|thumb|right|Niagara, Lockport and Ontario Power Company Common Stock]] The acquired Company’s officers were: [[Francis Vinton Greene|Francis V. Greene]], president (also vice president of Ontario Power Company); F. B. H. Paine, vice president and chief engineer (formerly export manager of the [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company]]); Robert C. Board, [[Corporate Secretary|secretary]] (also [[Corporate Secretary|secretary]] and [[treasurer]] of Ontario Power Company); and Clifford Hubbell, [[treasurer]]. Westinghouse replaced [[Cassius Milton Wicker]] as a director of the Company and the offices of the company moved to the [[Fidelity Trust Building]] in Buffalo.  [[Stephen Merrell Clement|Stephen M. Clement]], (president of [[Marine Midland Bank|Marine Bank]]), succeeded [[Washington Savings Bank (New York)|Joseph G. Robin]] on the board of syndicate managers for the [[underwriting]] of the company's [[Security (finance)|securities]].&lt;ref name="Buffalo Evening News"/&gt;

By 1908, the company had approximately 400 miles of transmission lines running from [[Devil's Hole State Park|Devil's Hole]] through [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] to [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], a total distance of 167 miles from the distributing station. It had branch lines running to [[West Seneca]], [[Batavia, New York|Batavia]], [[Caledonia, New York|Caledonia]], [[Avon, New York|Avon]], [[Auburn, New York|Auburn]], and [[Baldwinsville]] near [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. The right of way for the lines was owned by the company and was 300&amp;nbsp;ft. in width from the [[Niagara River]] to Lockport, 200&amp;nbsp;ft. from Lockport to Rochester, and 75&amp;nbsp;ft. the remainder of the way to [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. The company also leased a right of way on the [[West Shore Railroad]] from near [[Akron, New York|Akron]] to [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].  In January 1918, Niagara, Lockport and Ontario Power Company acquired the Salmon River Power Company, which operated their own [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power plant]] in [[Salmon River (New York)]] on the shore of [[Lake Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Legislative Document, Volume 9 NYS Legislature|date=1919|publisher=New York State Legislature|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvRBAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1943, the Niagara, Lockport and Ontario Power Company reorganized as the Niagara Hudson Company, Inc., and became a subsidiary of Niagara Hudson Power Corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Niagara Hudson Power Corporation|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/56338855/|accessdate=20 September 2015|publisher=Dunkirk Evening Observer|date=June 28, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a conglomerate of 59 separate power companies in [[Western New York]] formed in 1929&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Niagara Mohawk Corporation|url=http://www.lipsitzponterio.com/JobSites/City/Buffalo/NiagaraMohawk/HistoryandInformation/HistoryofNiagaraMohawk|website=lipsitzponterio.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1932, was the "nation's largest electric utility company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Niagara Hudson Building, Onondaga County, NY|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/weekly_features/10_06_25_Niagara_Hudson_Building.htm|website=nps.gov|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Niagara Hudson Power Corporation reorganized as the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buffalo Power Use|url=http://www.mikalac.com/tech/pow/niagara6.html|website=mikalac.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 2002, Niagara Mohawk was acquired by, and became a subsidiary of, [[National Grid plc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc.

===Lackawanna Steel Company===
{{main|Lackawanna Steel Company}}
[[File:Blowing Engines Lackawanna Steel 1907.png|thumb|left|Lackawanna Steel in 1907]]  In 1889, [[Lackawanna Steel Company|Lackawanna Iron and Steel Company]], at the time the largest steel company in the world, decided to move its facilities out of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].  Lackawanna was looking to move away from [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] because of increases in union labor cost and lack of railroad access to the company's newly emerging markets in the West.  They were drawn to [[Western New York]] by the area's easy access to the [[Great Lakes]] and the numerous rail lines in the area.&lt;ref name="A History of the City of Buffalo"&gt;{{cite news|title=A History of the City of Buffalo|url=http://buffaloah.com/h/lacksteel/index.html|publisher=The Buffalo Evening News|date=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lackawanna Company executives reached out to Buffalo attorney [[John G. Milburn]], who brought in Albright. Albright had been discussing organizing a steel plant in Buffalo with William A. Rogers (vice-president of [[Rogers, Brown &amp; Company]], the largest [[pig iron]] dealer in the [[United States]]), he asked that Rogers be brought into negotiations as well as [[Brig. Gen.]] [[Edmund B. Hayes]] (a [[civil engineer]] and businessman with the [[Union Bridge Company]]).&lt;ref name="A History of the City of Buffalo"/&gt;

To avoid [[speculation]], the company employed Albright to purchase land on its behalf.  In March 1899, the Company’s executives met with Albright, [[John G. Milburn|Milburn]], and Rogers (Hayes was in [[Jekyll Island]] at the time, but returned April 1) in Buffalo and explored several sites, ultimately choosing the undeveloped shoreline on [[Lake Erie]] in what was then the western part of the Town of [[West Seneca, New York|West Seneca]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Albright began purchasing land on April 1, 1899, and by the end of the month had obtained nearly all the required property for a price of $1,095,430.98 ({{Inflation|US|1095431|1899|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).  Albright was often accompanied on his purchasing visits by [[John G. Milburn|Milburn]], the president of the [[Pan-American Exposition]], and at the time, many property owners assumed the land purchases were for the [[Pan-American Exposition|Exposition]] which helped them obtain the land at a more reasonable price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaChiusa|first1=Chuck|title=Steel Plant a Certainty|url=http://buffaloah.com/h/alb/steel.html|website=buffaloah.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, construction on the massive steel mill started and in 1902, the company, of which Albright was then a principal shareholder, was reorganized as the Lackawanna Steel Company. The company moved their headquarters to the site and the plant began operation in 1903, By 1909, the residents of the area voted to split off from [[West Seneca, New York|West Seneca]] and formed the present day city of [[Lackawanna, New York]], named after the Company.  The [[Lackawanna Steel Company]] received its power from Albright’s Niagara Lockport and Ontario Power Company and he served as a director of the Lackawanna Steel Company,&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|title= J.J.

===Depew Improvement Company===
[[File:Plan for the Depew Improvement Company, Depew, NY.jpg|thumb|right|Olmsted Plan for the Depew Improvement Company, Depew, NY]]In 1892, [[New York Central Railroad]] chose the [[Depew, New York]] area (which straddles the towns of [[Lancaster (town), New York|Lancaster]] and [[Cheektowaga (town), New York|Cheektowaga]] and lies to the east of [[Buffalo, New York]]) as a permanent location for its shops and auxiliary establishments. At the time, there was only minimal infrastructure in the area.&lt;ref name="Village of Depew History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Village of Depew History|url=http://www.villageofdepew.org/about/village-history/|website=villageofdepew.com|publisher=Depew Bee|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chauncey Depew]], attorney for [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]’s railroad interests and President of New York Central Railroad, formed the Depew Investment Company and purchased 1,000 acres of land north and south of the tracks for their enterprise.  The original shareholders included Albright, George Urban, [[Wilson S. Bissell]] and Charles Gould. The officers of the Company were Albright as president and [[James A. Roberts]] as [[Corporate Secretary|secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Olmsted Firm in Buffalo: The Next Generation Arleyn Levee|date=1992|publisher=The Burchfield Art Center|location=Buffalo, NY|url=http://buffaloah.com/h/olm/levee/source/8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was eventually called "Depew" in honor of [[Chauncey Depew]].&lt;ref name="Village of Depew History"/&gt;

Albright worked closely with [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] to structure the nucleus of the town. In 1896, the Depew Improvement Company built a brick building at the corner of Transit and Ellicott (now Walden) for a bank, community center and village hall. The Company donated land for the German Lutheran Church, St. Peter and St.Paul, St. James, the Northside Fire House, Depew Village Park, and a [[YMCA]]. The company built streets, houses and the sewer system.&lt;ref name="Village of Depew History"/&gt;

===Buffalo Bolt Company===
In 1897, Albright and [[Edmund B. Hayes]] bought [[Buffalo Bolt Company]], which [[George C. Bell]] had founded in 1859.  Buffalo Bolt produced [[nut (hardware)|nuts]] and [[screw|bolts]] that were used by manufacturers in the production of automobiles, ships, trains, household appliances, and hundreds of other products.&lt;ref name="Niagara Gazette"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neal|first1=Donna Zellner|title=On Buffalo Bolt Co. and Oliver Street|url=http://www.niagara-gazette.com/opinion/guest-view-on-buffalo-bolt-co-and-oliver-street/article_c1de7c48-d25e-54e6-a7b4-e1a8b0afdb72.html|work=Niagara Gazette|date=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Albright, production increased many times over.  In 1869, Buffalo Bolt produced 14,000 nuts and bolts per day, and by 1911, the Company was producing 1,250,000 per day.&lt;ref name="Niagara Gazette"/&gt;  By 1920, Buffalo Bolt was producing 600,000,000 pieces of bolts, nuts, and screws as well as 5,000 varieties of finished products and 50,000 tons of steel rolled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Graphic Story of the Buffalo Bolt Plant Gallery|url=http://www.nthistorymuseum.org/Collections/boltgal-1.html|website=nthistorymuseum.org|publisher=North Tonawanda History Museum|accessdate=20 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925091104/http://www.nthistorymuseum.org/Collections/boltgal-1.html#|archive-date=2015-09-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, the company's main factory was located at 101 East Avenue in [[North Tonawanda, New York]], the general offices were in Buffalo, and the western offices were at 934 [[Monadnock Building]] in [[Chicago, IL]] and 1107 Chemical Building in [[St Louis, Mo]].&lt;ref name="Frank P.

Albright]] (Albright's son) and Ralph Plumb, vice presidents; G. A. Mitchell, treasurer; Robert C. Board, secretary. The Board of Directors was composed of: Albright, [[R. K. Albright]], [[Edmund B. Hayes]], Ralph Plumb, G. A. Mitchell, W. P. Cooke, and [[Anson Conger Goodyear]] (son of [[Charles W. Goodyear]]).&lt;ref name="Frank P. Bennett &amp; Company"/&gt;

The need for workers was so great that company paid the costs associated with [[Immigration to the United States|passage to America]] to bring [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Slovaks|Slovakian]] immigrants to the United States to work in their plant in North Tonawanda. The company built a [[company store]] and assisted employees with obtaining housing, with many employees settling in the Oliver Street area of North Tonawanda.  ''The Buffalo Bolt Company'', which employed up to 1,500 people at its peak, closed at the end of June 1959.&lt;ref name="Niagara Gazette"/&gt;

===Locomobile===
{{main|Locomobile Company of America}}
[[File:1903 Poor's Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad.jpg|thumb|right|Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad, 1903]]
In 1903, Albright’s former brother in law, [[Amzi L. Barber]], was in debt to the extent of $500,000 ({{Inflation|US|500000|1903|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). He had started the [[Locomobile Company of America|Locomobile]] automobile company in 1899 and to keep the company afloat, he surrendered two real estate deals to Albright, who agreed to endorse $300,000 worth of Locomobile [[commercial paper]] and give Barber an annuity of $12,000 ({{Inflation|US|120000|1903|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). He also paid the remaining $100,000 Barber still owed. Unfortunately, the company did not recover financially and was eventually liquidated in 1922, where it was acquired by [[William C. Durant]] of [[Durant Motors]] to compete against [[Rolls Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]] and [[Pierce-Arrow]] (manufactured in Buffalo).&lt;ref name="The Jekyll Island Cottage Colony"/&gt;

===Buffalo and Susquehanna Iron Company===
{{main|Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad}}
Albright, along with [[Edmund B. Hayes]] and [[Stephen Merrell Clement|Stephen M. Clement]], had invested in [[William A. Rogers]]’ ''Rogers, Brown &amp; Company'' subsidiary, ''The Iroquois Iron Company'', in [[South Chicago, Chicago|South Chicago, Illinois]], which owned a plant containing two [[blast furnace]]s.&lt;ref name="Buffalo Evening News"/&gt;

In 1904, Rogers invited Albright, Hayes and Clement to accompany him on one of his periodic visits, as they had not seen the property before. Purportedly, Frank H. Goodyear, another Buffalo businessman, heard of the trip and offered the use of his private car for the occasion. Rogers accepted and invited Goodyear and his brother [[Charles W. Goodyear]] to join the party. Goodyear was so impressed with the capacity of the plant to produce [[tonnage]] that he wanted one established on the line of the Goodyear brother’s ''[[Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad]]''.  Rogers and the Goodyear Brothers joined forces to create a company and plant in Buffalo that was called the Buffalo and Susquehanna Iron Company, named after the Goodyear brother’s Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad.&lt;ref name="Buffalo Evening News"/&gt;

Soon after, the ''Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad'', the ''Buffalo and Susquehanna Iron Company'', the ''[[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'', and the ''[[Lackawanna Steel Company]]'' jointly built a giant ship canal on the border of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] called the ''Union Ship Canal''. The canal, used by all parties, allowed room for steamships to bring in [[iron ore]] from Michigan and Minnesota to be reduced to [[pig iron]]. The ''Union Ship Canal'''s continued to be used as an industrial waterway until January 1982 with the closure of the [[M. A. Hanna Company|Hanna Blast Furnace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Union Ship Canal (Buffalo, New York)|url=http://wikimapia.org/16740247/Union-Ship-Canal|website=wikimapia.org|publisher=Buffalo Urban Development Corporation|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banking interests==
In May 1893, Albright, along with [[George V. Forman]], [[John Satterfield]], and [[Franklin D. Locke]], founded The Fidelity Trust and Guaranty Company of Buffalo, New York.&lt;ref name="wnyheritagepress.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eck |first1=Susan |title=The Marine: by any other name and address |url=http://wnyheritagepress.org/photos_week_2012/marine_midland/marine_midland_pt1.html |website=wnyheritagepress.org |accessdate=20 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111045022/http://wnyheritagepress.org/photos_week_2012/marine_midland/marine_midland_pt1.html |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1909, [[Edward Brodhead Green|E.

In December 1925, the Fidelity Trust Company, with $35 million in assets, merged with [[M&amp;T Bank|Manufacturers and Traders Bank]], founded in 1856, with $64 million in assets, under the new name [[M&amp;T Bank|Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company]].  The $100 million company was headed by Fidelity's President, 36-year-old [[Lewis G. Harriman]]. Harriman and a group of investors including [[A. H. Schoellkopf]], from the founding family of the [[Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company]], and [[James Forrestal]], who would become the first [[United States Secretary of Defense]], owned enough shares to control both Fidelity and [[M&amp;T Bank|M&amp;T]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M&amp;T Bank Celebrates 150 Years|url=http://ir.mandtbank.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=208314|website=mandtbank.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine National Bank===
{{main|Marine Midland Bank}}
In 1908, separate from his involvement with The Fidelity Trust and Guaranty Company, Albright served as vice president of [[Marine Midland Bank|Marine Bank]]'s [[Board of Directors]],&lt;ref name="wnyheritagepress.org"/&gt; along with [[Stephen M. Clement]] (president), [[Charles W. Goodyear]] (founder of the [[Great Southern Lumber Company]]), [[William H.

==Philanthropy==

===Albright Memorial Building===
{{main|Albright Memorial Building}}
In 1890, Albright hired [[Edward Brodhead Green|E. B. Green]] of [[Edward Brodhead Green|Green &amp; Wicks]] to design the [[Albright Memorial Building]] in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], in honor of his parents. The building, also known as "Scranton Public Library," was completed in early 1893 and is a two-story, "L"-shaped, Indiana [[limestone]] and Medina [[sandstone]] building with [[Châteauesque]]-style design elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaChiusa|first1=Chuck|title=Albright Memorial Library|url=http://buffaloah.com/a/virtual/us/scran/Alb/ext/index.html|website=buffaloah.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = {{NRHP-PA|H000638_01H.pdf}}| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Albright Memorial Building| accessdate = 2012-01-02| author = Dorothy Reddington| format = PDF| date= September 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools and churches===
In 1892, Albright helped found the [[Nichols School]] by bringing William Nichols to Buffalo to set up the school, and supported the ''Elmwood School'' (which merged with the Franklin School in 1941 to form the Elmwood Franklin School), the oldest independent school in [[Western New York]], founded in 1889. In 1904, he donated the land for the [[Unitarian Universalist Church of Buffalo]] and gave significant donations to the [[Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens|South Park Botanical Gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The John J.

===Albright Art Gallery===
His largest gift was in 1900 when he made a donation of $350,000 ({{Inflation|US|350000|1900|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) so that the then ‘’Fine Arts Academy", founded in 1862, could have a permanent home.  The building was designed by prominent architect [[Edward Brodhead Green|Green]] and was originally intended to be used as the Fine Arts Pavilion for the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in 1901, but delays in its construction and increased costs (the total cost was purported to be closer to $1,000,000 ({{Inflation|US|1000000|1905|r=-3|fmt=eq}})) caused it to remain uncompleted until 1905, when it opened as the [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery|Albright Art Gallery]]. The [[Pan-American Exposition]] was held in Buffalo from May 1, 1901 through November 2, 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the 1905 Albright Art Gallery|url=http://buffaloah.com/a/elmwd/1285/albhist.html|website=buffaloah.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Brodhead Green|Green]] designed the gallery along the lines of a Greek temple and included 102 columns, more than any other American structure except the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]] in Washington. The building was constructed using 5,000 tons of white marble from a [[Maryland]] quarry, the same marble used in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] and the [[Washington Monument]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gift of the Albright Art Gallery 1900 - 1905|url=http://wnyheritagepress.org/photos_week_2015/albright_knox/construction/construction.html|website=wnyheritagepress.org|accessdate=20 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927092814/http://wnyheritagepress.org/photos_week_2015/albright_knox/construction/construction.html|archivedate=27 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Gallery opened on May 31, 1905, [[Harvard University]] President, [[Charles William Eliot]], gave the [[keynote]] address and four city [[choral]] organizations performed together. [[Richard Watson Gilder]] read a poem he had written celebrating the gallery's opening. Albright, however, did not give a speech or appear in any photographs from the ceremony as he had always been inclined to avoid the spotlight. Birge Albright, his grandson, said that Albright took friends to the gallery on Sundays when there were few others around.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1872, Albright married Harriet Langdon (1847&amp;ndash;1895), the sister of his business partner, [[Andrew Langdon]]. Harriet and Andrew were first cousins with [[Olivia Langdon Clemens]] (1845–1904), the wife of [[Samuel Langhorne Clemens]] (1835–1910), also known as [[Mark Twain]].&lt;ref name="marktwainproject.org"/&gt;  Olivia, who was originally from a wealthy family in [[Elmira, New York]], and Twain lived in Buffalo from 1869 to 1871 where Twain owned a stake in the ''[[Buffalo Courier-Express|Buffalo Express]]'' newspaper and worked as an editor and writer. Together, John and Harriet had three children together, all born in [[Washington D.C.]]:&lt;ref name="Nardin Academy"/&gt; Raymond King Albright, Ruth Albright, and Langdon Albright.

In 1895, Susan Fuller (1868&amp;ndash;1928) was brought to Buffalo to educate the three Albright children. In March 1897, within two years of her arrival in Buffalo, 28-year-old Susan (daughter of Eben and Nancy Fuller) married 49-year-old Albright. Fuller was a recent [[Smith College]] graduate from [[Lancaster, Massachusetts]].  The couple honeymooned at the [[Jekyl Island Club]]. Together, John and Susan had five children:&lt;ref name="Nardin Academy"/&gt;  John "Jack" Joseph Albright Jr.,  Elizabeth "Betty" Albright, [[Fuller Albright]], Nancy Albright, and Susan "Susy" Albright.&lt;ref name="Susan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|title=SUSAN ALBRIGHT REED, GALLERY FOUNDER'S KIN|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22764049.html|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[The Buffalo News]] |date=November 5, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, Albright and two of his daughters, were painted by [[Edmund Charles Tarbell]].  The oil painting, entitled ''John J. Albright and His Daughters'', is owned by the [[Westmoreland Museum of American Art]] in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]]. Tarbell also painted a portrait of Albright that is currently at the Albright-Knox gallery.&lt;ref name="1000museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=PORTRAIT OF FATHER AND CHILDREN (JOHN J. ALBRIGHT)|url=https://www.1000museums.com/art_works/edmund-charles-tarbell-portrait-of-father-and-children-john-j-albright|website=1000museums.com|publisher=1000 Museums|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John J. Albright died on August 20, 1931, at the age of 83, six weeks after an intestinal operation. He is buried with his family at the [[Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;

===Clubs and memberships===
Albright was elected a director of The [[Buffalo Fine Arts Academy]] in 1887, served as president from 1895 to 1897, and remained on the Board until 1910.  He was also a member Jekyll Island Club from 1890 until his death in 1931. He was a member of the [[American Academy in Rome]], the Buffalo Club, the University Club of Buffalo, the [[Country Club of Buffalo]], and [[Delta Phi]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;   In April 1926, Albright sold many valuable paintings and works of art, including: a [[Anton Mauve|Mauve]], a [[Charles Jacque|Jacque]], two by [[Narcisse Virgilio Díaz|Diaz]], a [[Emile Claus|Claus]], a [[Constant Troyon|Troyon]], and others by André Crochepierre, Louis Adan, [[Abbott Handerson Thayer|Abbott H. Thayer]] and a [[Thomas Lawrence|Lawrence]] portrait of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], at the [[American Art Association|Anderson Galleries]] in [[New York City]] as a gift to Buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paintings Put On Sale|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1926/04/11/issue.html|work=The New York Times|date=April 11, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1929, the [[University at Buffalo]] conferred upon Albright the Chancellor’s Medal, its highest honor, recognition of his achievements throughout his life.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;

Albright's second wife, Susan, was a member of the "Board of Women Managers' Entertainment &amp; Ceremony" sub-committee and the ‘’Committee on Fine Arts" for the [[Pan American Exposition]].  Susan died on June 19, 1928.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;

===Residences===
In 1887, Albright acquired the [[James Wadsworth (mayor)|Wadsworth]]'s House, former [[mayor of Buffalo, New York|mayor of Buffalo]], at 730 [[Upper West Side, Buffalo, New York|West Ferry]] in Buffalo.  In 1890 he hired the [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted Firm]] to design the grounds. When the house was destroyed by fire in 1901, he hired [[Edward Brodhead Green|Green &amp; Wicks]] to design a new Tudor style home. The [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted]]'s work for Albright continued until 1907.&lt;ref name="Nardin Academy"/&gt;

[[Edward Brodhead Green|E. B. Green]] designed the new Albright mansion after the [[manor house]] of [[St. Catherine's Court]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] [[England]]. A former neighbor of the Albrights recalled, "It was a huge house. It was not unlike the [[Canisius High School|Rand House]] on Delaware". When the property was first built, the streets Tudor Place and St. Catherine's Court did not exist. The property had a red brick wall that surrounded the estate.  Local writer Edwine Noye Mitchell wrote that the gray stone house, was surrounded "by terraces where the [[crocus]] and [[scilla]] pushed up between the flagstones in the spring, and the pink magnolia blossoms lay thick over the grass from the sidewalk.&lt;ref name="Nardin Academy"/&gt;

The Albrights' property ran from 690 to 770 West Ferry and extended from West Ferry to Cleveland Avenue on at least 12 acres of land.&lt;ref name="Nardin Academy"/&gt;  In 1935, the Albright house on West Ferry was demolished and the estate was sold in multiple parcels for homes to be built on. Green salvaged the stone [[balustrade]] from the terrace and had it reinstalled in front of [[University at Buffalo Libraries|Lockwood Library]] at the [[University of Buffalo]]'s Main Street campus soon after.  A wrought iron gate, known today as "Queen Anne's Gate" and which still stands [[Border guard|sentinel]] outside of the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John J. Albright Estate, West Ferry Street|url=http://wnyheritagepress.org/photosofweek/albrightestate.htm|website=wnyheritagepress.org|accessdate=20 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926135305/http://wnyheritagepress.org/photosofweek/albrightestate.htm|archivedate=26 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1914, Albright and his second wife Susan, purchased the 26 room [[Joseph Pulitzer]] Cottage, in [[Jekyl Island]], in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], fully furnished, after spending many winters on the island with their family. While there, the Albrights struck up a friendship with the poet laureate of England, [[Alfred Noyes]] and his wife, who visited them in Jeykl Island in 1914. Albright introduced Noyes to [[William Rockefeller]] and other Jekyl Islanders who were at the club.&lt;ref name="The Jekyll Island Cottage Colony"/&gt; The house was sold in 1931 after Albrights death and when the State of Georgia acquired the entire Jekyl Island in 1947, the cottage was still standing. In 1951, a fire damaged the interior and on June 23, 1951, the cottage was demolished as there were no funds were available to repair the damage.&lt;ref name="The Jekyll Island Cottage Colony"/&gt;

The so-called '''Jäger Report''', also Jaeger Report (full title: ''Complete tabulation of executions carried out in the Einsatzkommando 3 zone up to December 1, 1941'')&lt;ref name="phdn-1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Jaeger Report: A Chronicle of Nazi Mass Murder |work=English translation of the Report along with scanned images of the original |publisher=The Holocaust History Project |url=http://phdn.org/archives/holocaust-history.org/works/jaeger-report/htm/img001.htm.en.html |author=Karl Jäger, Commander of the Security Police and the SD, Einsatzkommando 3 |location=Kauen |date=December 1, 1941 |at=webpages 1–9 with transcriptions of photostat facsimiles}}&lt;/ref&gt; was written on 1 December 1941 by [[Karl Jäger]], commander of [[Einsatzkommando|''Einsatzkommando'' 3]] (EK 3), a [[death squad|killing unit]] of [[Einsatzgruppen|''Einsatzgruppe'' A]] which was attached to [[Army Group North]] during the [[Operation Barbarossa]]. It is the most detailed and precise surviving chronicle of the activities of one individual ''Einsatzkommando'', and a key record documenting [[the Holocaust in Lithuania]] as well as in [[the Holocaust in Latvia|Latvia]] and [[the Holocaust in Belarus|Belarus]].&lt;ref name=head/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Map used to illustrate Stahlecker's report to Heydrich on January 31, 1942.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Map Stahlecker attached to his report to [[Reinhard Heydrich]] using the execution tally from the updated Jäger's report]]
The Jäger Report is a tally sheet of actions by ''Einsatzkommando'' 3, including the [[Rollkommando Hamann|''Rollkommando'' Hamann]] killing squad.&lt;ref name="phdn-1"/&gt; The report keeps an almost daily running total of the murders of 137,346 people, the vast majority Jews, from 2 July 1941 to 25 November 1941. The report documents date and place of the massacres, number of victims and their breakdown into categories (Jews, communists, criminals, etc.). In total, there were 112 executions in 71 different locations in Lithuania, Latvia, and Belarus.&lt;ref name=gaunt/&gt; On 17 occasions, daily casualties exceeded 2,000 people.&lt;ref name=gaunt/&gt; On 9 February 1942, in a handwritten note for [[Franz Walter Stahlecker]], Jäger updated the totals to 138,272 people: 136,421 Jews (46,403 men, 55,556 women and 34,464 children), 1,064 [[communist]]s, 653 mentally disabled, and 134 others.&lt;ref name=wette147/&gt; The report concluded that Lithuania was now [[Judenfrei|free of Jews]] except for about 34,500 Jews concentrated in [[Vilna Ghetto|Vilnius]], [[Kovno Ghetto|Kaunas]] and [[Šiauliai Ghetto]]s.&lt;ref name=head/&gt; However, Jäger Report did not tally all Jewish deaths in Lithuania as it did not include executions by ''Einsatzkommando'' 2 in [[Šiauliai]] area (approx. 46,000 people), in some border areas (for example, in [[Šakiai]] on September 13, [[Kudirkos Naumiestis]] on September 19, [[Kretinga]] in July–August, [[Gargždai]] on June 24, 1941), or even in Vilnius (for example, the report is missing the October 1 ([[Yom Kippur]]) massacre of some 4,000 Jews).&lt;ref name=arad/&gt;&lt;ref name=dieck/&gt;

The nine-page report was prepared in five copies,&lt;ref name="phdn-1"/&gt; but only one survives and is kept by the Special Archive, part of the {{illm|Russian State Military Archive|ru|Российский государственный военный архив}} in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name=gitel/&gt; The copy was discovered in 1944 when Red Army recaptured Lithuania, but it was not made known to scholars or the judiciary evaluating Nazi war crimes.&lt;ref name=wette/&gt; Only in 1963, during the ''[[in absentia]]'' trial of [[Hans Globke]] in [[East Germany]]&lt;ref name=braza/&gt; and four years after Jäger's suicide, Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] disclosed the document to the German [[Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes]].&lt;ref name=wette/&gt; The document was first published in a Lithuanian collection of documents ''Masinės žudynės Lietuvoje'' in 1965&lt;ref name=stank/&gt; and in Western press by {{illm|Adalbert Rückerl|de}} in 1972 as a [[facsimile]].&lt;ref name=wette/&gt;

'''''Kincaid v. Gibson''''', 236 F. 3d 342 (6th Cir. 2001) was a [[United States]] court case before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] dealing with [[freedom of expression]].

Charles Kincaid and Carpi Coffer, students at [[Kentucky State University]], filed the suit against Betty Gibson, KSU's Vice President for Student Affairs.

The Kentucky State University reviewed the 1992-1994 edition of The Thoroughbred Yearbook and the administration decided that it was not satisfactory and locked it in a closet. In particular the administration did not feel as though the yearbook should have a section with current events and they did not like the fact that the school colors were not on the yearbook.

Charles Kincaid and Carpi Coffer filed suit on behalf of the students against the university. Initially the lower courts ruled in favor of the school using the ''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'' case as an example of how students can be censored by school administrations. Eventually the case made it all the way to the Sixth Court of Appeals. After failing to win a decision the students appealed to have the circuit court rule ''[[en banc]]''.

The court heard the case on Jan. 5, 2001 and by a 10-3 decision decided for the students. This is significant because the court made it clear that the ''Hazelwood'' case should not be applied to the college media.

In March 2001, the students and KSU settled with money and attorney's fees changing hands to the students. Also the students, seven years later, received their yearbook that they had paid for in 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3050">'''Les Arts Décoratifs''' is a private, non-profit [[museum]] of decorative arts located in [[Paris]], [[France]].

==History and Operations==
The museum dates to 1882, when collectors with an interest in the applied arts formed the initial organization. For many years it was known as the Union centrale des Arts décoratifs (UCAD), but in December 2004 it was renamed Les Arts Decoratifs.

The museum currently occupies three sites, with the Ateliers du Carrousel (art and craft workshops) active at all three:

* 107 rue de Rivoli, in the [[Louvre]]'s Rohan and Marsan wings — [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris|Musée des Arts Décoratifs]]
* 63 rue de Monceau — the [[Musée Nissim de Camondo]] in the Hôtel Camondo.
* 266 boulevard Raspail — École Camondo, school of design and interior architecture.

As of 2006, its collections included approximate 357,100 works as follows:

* Arts Décoratifs — 150,000 works from medieval furniture to contemporary design, including Empire, Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles; large collections of jewelry, toys, wallpaper, gold work, ceramics, glass, drawings and an Islamic and Oriental collection.
* Publicité — 100,000 historical and contemporary posters as well as over 20,000 French and foreign advertising films from the 1930s to the present day; radio commercials, promotional objects, packaging, and more from the formerly separate [[Musée de la Publicité]].
* Mode et textile — 86,000 costumes, accessories, and textiles from Copts to the present day; from the formerly separate [[Musée de la mode et du textile]].
* Musée Nissim de Camondo — 1,100 works; one of the finest sets of French furniture and [[objets d'art]] from the second half of the 18th century.
* In May 2007, Les Arts Décoratifs exhibited Love &amp; Art Children's Foundation's "L'Enfant et l'Art" collection.  This art collection was created by children afflicted with cancer at the Hospital Armand Trousseau in sterilized rooms and by children in remission in Les Ateliers du Carrousel under the guidance of Love &amp; Art's founder, artist Alécia de Menezes Seidler.

'''Lithuanian Partisans Declaration of February 16, 1949''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos laisvės kovos sąjūdžio deklaracija}}) is a document, created by [[Lithuanian partisans]] and signed by [[Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters]] (ULFF) on February 16, 1949 in&amp;nbsp;[[Minaičiai]] ([[Radviliškis District Municipality]]). By signing the declaration, the ULFF assumed responsibility to lead the restoration of independent democratic state of [[Lithuania]], where equal rights for all citizens and social care is guaranteed. Document also states that "[[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist party]], as dictatorial and essentially opposite to the main aim of Lithuanian nation and keystone provision of the Constitution – independence of Lithuania, – is not considered a legal party". The declaration appeals to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], [[Lithuanian Constitution of 1922]] and addresses whole democratic world asking for help.

Declaration was signed by the chairman of ULFF Council Presidium [[Jonas Žemaitis|Jonas Žemaitis-Vytautas]] and members of the Council: [[Aleksandras Grybinas-Faustas]], [[Vytautas Gužas-Kardas]], [[Juozas Šibaila-Merainis]], [[Bronislovas Liesis-Naktis]], [[Leonardas Grigonis-Užpalis]], [[Adolfas Ramanauskas|Adolfas Ramanauskas-Vanagas]] and [[Petras Bartkus-Žadgaila]].

In 1996, [[Seimas]] recognized the Declaration as an official act of the Republic of Lithuania and Žemaitis as a [[President of Lithuania]].

In 2010, eight partisans, who had signed the Declaration, were awarded with status of signatories. The status (posthumously) was awarded to Bartkus, Grigonis, Grybinas, Gužas, Liesis, Ramanauskas, Šibaila and Žemaitis.

On November 22, 2010, a monument was unveiled in [[Minaičiai]] to honor the Declaration and its signatories (author – sculptor Jonas Jagėla). The barn and the bunker, where the Declaration had been signed, were restored in 2012 to house an exposition "Give the Homeland what you have to" ({{lang-lt|Atiduok Tėvynei, ką privalai}}).

[[File:Philaartmusliv8.jpg|thumb|View of Live 8 crowd along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway]]
On 2 July 2005, a [[Live 8]] concert was held in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]] in front of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], with a densely packed audience stretched out for one mile along the [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]].  The event was organized by the [[ONE Campaign]].

It was one of the first Live 8 concerts announced, as the city had played host to its [[Live Aid]] predecessor in 1985, and, until the inclusion of a concert outside [[Toronto]], was the only city in [[North America]] to represent Live 8.  It did, however, remain the only [[United States]] city to participate in the event.

The event is also referred to as '''"Live 8 Philadelphia"''', '''"Live 8 Philly"''', or '''"Live 8 USA"'''.

Unlike other venues, no tickets were issued to control access, and Philadelphia police declined to give a crowd estimate.  Presenters stated several times on stage that over one million people were at the concert.
Non-organizer estimates ranged from 600,000 to 800,000 and one million to 1.5 million. Some estimates are of the number of people at the concert at any one time, while other estimates are of the total number of people on the Parkway over the course of the nearly 8 hour-long event.

==Performance notes==
[[File:Destiny's Child Live 8.jpg|thumb|Destiny's Child at Live 8]]

Several artists mentioned or dedicated performances to [[Luther Vandross]] who had died the day before.

The show managed to expose fault in the [[SEPTA Regional Rail]] system, which is the commuter rail portion of the city's mass transit system, [[SEPTA]].  Trains to and from the concert were overcrowded and many had to ignore departure times in order to accommodate the unprecedented influx of passengers using the system at one time.

Two days after the concert, [[Elton John]] gave a free concert on the same stage used for Live 8, as part of the city's [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations.

==Pre-show news and rumours==
Live 8 producer/promoter [[Russell Simmons]] was the man responsible for adding more [[African American]] artists to the Live 8 Philadelphia bill, including some [[Def Poetry Jam]] poets.

After noticing the lack of hip-hop artists on the bill, [[Bono]] called Jay-Z and [[Mike Shinoda]] of [[Linkin Park]] personally and asked them to perform in Philadelphia. [[50 Cent]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Usher Raymond|Usher]], and [[Sean Combs]] were also originally scheduled to perform but cancelled due to scheduling conflicts.

Despite suspicions that the show's finale would consist of a new rendition of the [[USA for Africa]] hit "[[We Are the World]]", which was performed at the Philadelphia show twenty years ago at [[Live Aid]], it did not.

Also, rumors circulated in the crowd that Bruce Springsteen would close the show.

==Coverage==

In the United States, [[MTV]] and [[VH1]] provided intermittent and incomplete live and taped coverage, frequently breaking away mid-song for commercials or commentary by their veejays.  [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] provided a short highlights program that evening.

In the United Kingdom, [[BBC One]] aired highlights after the full coverage of the [[Live 8 concert, London|London show]]. Furthermore, [[BBC Three]] aired further highlights the following evening. [[Clair Companies|Clair Brothers Audio Systems]] and [[Franklin Simon Productions]] were responsible for providing the live sound reinforcement for Live 8 Philadelphia. [[Electric Factory Concerts]] was also involved in the production. Clair Brothers also provided the live sound reinforcment for Live 8 London. The remaining venues were handled by local sound reinforcement companies. 

[[AOL]] also provided a [[webcast]] of the entire show as it happened and carried webcasts of almost all of the Live 8 shows.

Before earning his Ph.D. at Harvard, he was already a curator at the [[Fogg Art Museum]] and [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt; He is a world-renowned expert on Mughal painting of the Akbar to Shah Jahan periods and has published important catalogues on the subject including ''The Grand Mogul: Imperial Painting in India 1600-1660'' (Williamstown, 1978), now a classic in its field.[https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_grand_Mogul.html?id=cw7rAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]

He served as the chair of the art department at [[Williams College]].&lt;ref name=SIA2 /&gt; He became director of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Arthur M.

In 1993, Beach published his research on the British [[Royal Collection]]'s 17th-century manuscript of the ''[[Padshahnama]]''. The [[Royal Librarian (United Kingdom)|Royal Librarian]] described the publication as the "best catalogue ever produced for an exhibition from [[Windsor Castle]]."&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt; In October, 2001, Beach retired as the director of both the Sackler and the [[Freer Gallery of Art]]. Beach returned to research, specifically focusing on the work of the [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt;

'''Ray''' "'''Thunder'''" '''Stern''', born '''Walter Bookbinder''', (January 12, 1933 – March 6, 2007) was an American [[professional wrestler]], [[bodybuilder]] and [[entrepreneur]].

At age 13 he joined the [[Merchant Marines]] using the name Paul Davis and discovered bodybuilding, a sport he loved so much he would carry a pair of 50 pound [[dumbbells]] in his duffel bag for workouts. In 1950 Stern began wrestling at age 17 in [[New York City]] working for [[Rudy Dusek]]. Due to his penchant for aerial moves promoters nicknamed him "Thunder".

Stern opened the first co-ed [[gym]] in the United States in [[San Francisco, California]], as well as the first with a nursery. He also worked with real estate and rental properties.

Stern was also an avid flier, and during his wrestling career this allowed him to travel great distances in short periods to conduct more business and matches in a quicker span. He founded [[Stern Air]] in [[Addison, Texas]] with a fleet of Lear Jets and Falcon's. He even flew to Czechoslovakia to train with their national aerobatic champions, and was so successful that the team named him as an official backup member at the world level.

In 1994 Stern published his [[autobiography]], ''Power and Thunder: The Rags to Riches Story of One Man's Adventure of Fame, Fortune, Romance &amp; Fitness''. He was also awarded the [[Cauliflower Alley Club#2000|Iron Mike Mazurki Award in 2000]] at that year's '''[[Cauliflower Alley Club]]''' reunion, an award that recognizes wrestlers for success outside the industry.

In 2005 he received the '''New York State Award''' (now since renamed the '''Senator [[Hugh Farley]] Award''') from the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]] in [[Amsterdam, New York]].

On March 6, 2007, Stern died after complications from [[heart surgery]]. He was 74 years old.
he is survived by his wife of 10 years Debi Stern, a fitness athlete and IFBB judge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/03/06/3704134.html slam.canoe.ca] - Ray "Thunder" Stern dead at 74

The '''Regina Manifesto'''  was the programme of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] and was adopted at the first national convention of the CCF held in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] in 1933.  The primary goal of the "Regina Manifesto" was to eradicate the system of [[capitalism]] and replace it with a planned socialist economy. The CCF was a [[democratic socialist]] party founded in 1932 by farmers, workers and socialist groups against the backdrop of the [[Great Depression]].

The Manifesto was largely written by members of the [[League for Social Reconstruction]], particularly [[Frank Underhill]] and [[F. R. Scott]], and called for  "''a planned and socialized economy in which our natural resources and principal means of production and distribution are owned, controlled and operated by the people''". Specifically it called for the [[nationalization]] of transportation, communications, electrical power and other services. It called for a [[planned economy]] and a national banking system that would be "removed from the control of private profit-seeking interests." It advocated the ability to organize in [[trade union]]s and called for a National Labour Code "to secure for the worker maximum income and leisure, insurance covering illness, accident, old age, and unemployment." The Regina Manifesto proposed social service programs such as [[publicly funded health care]], supported peace, promoted [[co-operative]] enterprises and vowed that "''No C.C.F. Government will rest content until it has eradicated capitalism and put into operation the full programme of socialized planning which will lead to the establishment in Canada of the [[Cooperative Commonwealth]].''"

The Regina Manifesto remained the CCF's official programme until 1956 when, in the face of the strong [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] sentiment of the [[Cold War]], it was replaced by the more moderate [[Winnipeg Declaration]] which substituted [[Keynesian economics]] for socialist remedies.

Retrieved 2008-09-04&lt;/ref&gt; Although it can be used in many contexts and among different age groups, relational aggression among [[Adolescence|adolescents]] in particular, has received a lot of attention. 

The attention relational aggression has received has been augmented by the help of popular media, including movies like ''[[Mean Girls]]'' and books like ''[[Odd Girl Out (novel)|Odd Girl Out]]'' by R. Simmons (2003), [[Nesthäkchen and the World War]] by [[Else Ury]] (1916), and ''[[Queen Bees and Wannabes]]'' by R. Wiseman (2003). Relational aggression can have various lifelong [[Relational aggression#Consequences of victimization|consequences]]. Relational aggression has been primarily observed and studied among girls, following pioneering research by psychologist [[Nicki R. Crick]].&lt;ref name="Underwood" /&gt;

== Overview ==

A person's [[Adolescence#Peers|peers]] become increasingly significant in adolescence and are especially important for adolescents' healthy psychological development. Peers provide many new behavioral models and feedback that are essential for successful identity formation and for the development of one's sense of self.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B. B., Clasen, D. R., &amp; Eicher, S. A. (1986). An adolescent's peers also have a large impact on peer pressure, peer conformity, dispositions, and self-reported behavior. ''Developmental Psychology'', 22(4), 521-530. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.22.4.521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B. (2004) Adolescents' relationships with peers. In R. Lerner and L. Steinberg (Eds.), ''Handbook of adolescent psychology''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions with peers encourage positive practice of autonomy and independent decision-making skills.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, J. &amp; Holmbeck, G. (1986) Attachment and autonomy during adolescence. In G. Whitehurst (Ed.), ''Annals of child development''. Greenwich, CT: JAI Press&lt;/ref&gt; They are also essential for healthy [[Adolescence#Romance and sexual activity|sexual development]] including the development of the capacity for intimate friendships and learning appropriate sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, H. S. (1953a) ''The interpersonal theory of psychiatry''. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; Peer relationships are also very important for determining how much adolescents value school, how much effort they put into it, and how well they perform in class.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, J. (1983b) The influence of friends on achievement and affective outcomes. In J. Epstein &amp; N. Karweit (Eds.), ''Friends in school''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, A.M. (2001) The peer group as a context for the development of young adolescent motivation and achievement. ''Child Development, 72''(4), 1135-1150&lt;/ref&gt;
However, quite frequently adolescents take part in peer relationships that are harmful for their psychological development. Adolescents tend to form various [[clique]]s and belong to different [[Crowds (adolescence)|crowds]] based on their activity interests, music and clothing preferences, as well as their cultural or ethnic background.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B., &amp; Mounts, N. (1989, April). Peer groups structures in single versus multiethnic high schools. Paper presented at the biennial meetings of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego&lt;/ref&gt; Such groups differ in their sociometric or popularity status, which often create unhealthy, aggression-victimization based dynamics between groups. Different forms of aggression can also be used to control dynamics and sociometric status within a group. Sometimes aggression is directed to an individual rather than to any apparent social group. Primary reasons for victimization include looks and speech; adolescents are also frequently bullied because of a disability, particular ethnicity, or religion.&lt;ref name="Nansel 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007"&gt;Klomek, A. B., Marrocco, F., Kleinman, M., Schonfeld, I. S., &amp; Gould, M. S. (2007). Bullying, Depression, and Suicidality in Adolescents.

=== Definition ===

Relational aggression is defined as a type of aggression that is "intended to harm others through deliberate manipulation of their social standing and relationships".&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2001"&gt;{{Cite book|page=100|title= Study Guide for Use with Adolescence|last1= Steinberg | authorlink = Laurence Steinberg |first1= Laurence D.|last2= Reyome |first2= Nancy Dodge|last3= Bjornsen |first3= Christopher A.|isbn=9780072414615|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWXtbGYpAu4C|date=2001|publisher= McGraw-Hill Higher Education |quote=relational aggression&amp;nbsp;– intended to harm others through deliberate manipulation of their social standing and relationships}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational aggression, according to Daniel Olweus&lt;ref name="Olweus 1991"&gt;Olweus, D. (1991). Bully/victim problems among schoolchildren: Basic facts and effects of a school based intervention program. In D. J. Pepler &amp; K. H. Rubin (Eds.), ''The development and treatment of childhood aggression'' (pp. 441-448). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[bullying]]. Bullying in general, is defined as physically or psychologically violent re-occurring and not provoked acts, where the bully and victim have unequal physical strength or/and psychological power.&lt;ref&gt;Olweus, D. (1999). Sweden. In P. K. Smith, Y. Morita, J. Junger-Tas, D. Olweus, R. Catalano, &amp; P.Slee (Eds.), The nature of school bullying: A cross-national perspective (pp. 7-27). New York:Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; These key conditions apply to all types of bullying: [[Verbal abuse|verbal]], [[Physical abuse|physical]], relational.&lt;ref name="Olweus 1991" /&gt;

== Types ==
Relational aggression may be either covert or direct, and is distinct from other forms of indirect aggression.&lt;ref name="Murray-Close et al."&gt;
{{Cite journal |first1=Diana|last1=Murray-Close |first2= Jamie M. |last2= Ostrov |first3= David A. |last3= Nelson |first4= Nicki R. |last4= Crick |first5= Emil F. |last5= Coccaro |title= Proactive, reactive, and romantic relational aggression in adulthood: Measurement, predictive validity, gender differences, and association with Intermittent Explosive Disorder |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research |date=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2009.09.005|pmc=2849926 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be proactive (planned and goal-oriented) or reactive (in response to perceived threats, hostility, or anger), and it can be, for instance, peer-directed or romantic.&lt;ref name="Murray-Close et al."/&gt;
Several studies have indicated substantive differences between proactive and reactive relational aggression. Reactive aggression is associated with a tendency to assume that others' intentions are hostile ([[hostile attribution bias]]).&lt;ref name="Murray-Close et al."/&gt;

Most studies of relational aggression have involved children or adolescents; the study of relational aggression in adults presents problems.&lt;ref name="Murray-Close et al."/&gt; Relational aggression is a common aspect of [[workplace bullying]], and is a characteristic behaviour of [[Psychopathy in the workplace|psychopaths in the workplace]], so it is commonplace amongst adults as well as children.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Manifestations ==
Manifestations of relational aggression include:&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008"&gt;[[Laurence Steinberg|Steinberg, L.]] (2008). Adolescence, 8th ed. 101. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excluding others from social activities;
* Damaging victim's reputations with others by spreading rumors and [[gossip]]ing about the victim, or [[humiliating]] him/her in front of others;
* Withdrawing attention and friendship.

[[Psychological manipulation]] and [[coercion]] can also be considered as a type of relational aggression.

Most recent research has been focusing on [[cyber-bullying]], which is a relatively new yet increasingly popular way of engaging in both verbal and relational aggression due to growing importance of various communication and technology devices in modern societies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cyberbullying.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show that internet meanness is more common among girls than boys.&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007" /&gt;

== Prevalence ==

Many studies in the U.S. and Europe show that at least 30% of students report having been bullied in one or another way.{{Citation needed|reason=What studies?|date=August 2013}} Some studies indicate even higher percentages of victimization.&lt;ref name="Nansel 2001" /&gt; Bullying in schools happens in all forms and at various ages, although peer bullying has the highest prevalence in 6th-8th grades.&lt;ref&gt;Jankauskiene, R., Kardelis, K., Sukys, S., &amp; Kardeliene, L. (2008). Associations between school bullying and psychosocial factors. Social Behavior and Personality, 36(2), 145-162&lt;/ref&gt; The most common forms of bullying are verbal with relational, or various forms of ostracism, coming in second.&lt;ref&gt;Valeckiene, D. (2005). Priekabiavimo kaip vienos dazniausiai naudojamos agresijos formos mokykloje raiSkos analiz (The analysis of bullying as one of the most prevalent form of aggression at schools). Sveikatos ir socialiniu mokslu taikomieji tyrimai: sandura ir saveika, 1, 49-65&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences ===

Although it can be used by both genders, relational aggression is more commonly associated with girls.&lt;ref name="Nansel 2001"&gt;Nansel, Tonja R., et al. "Bullying behaviors among US youth: Prevalence and association with psychosocial adjustment." JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association, v. 285 issue 16, 2001, p. 2094-2100&lt;/ref&gt; Findings of a study by Rivers and Smith&lt;ref&gt;Rivers I, Smith PK. Types of bullying behaviour and their correlates. Aggressive Behav. 1994;20:359-368.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that while verbal aggression occurs with similar frequency in both sexes, direct [[Physical abuse|physical aggression]] is more common among boys and indirect aggression is more common among girls. In another study by Baldry&lt;ref&gt;Baldry AC. Bullying among Italian middle school students. Sch Psychol Int. 1998;19:361-374.&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that boys are more likely to engage in bullying behaviors such as threats, physical harm, rejection, and name-calling, while girls are most likely to use name-calling, teasing, rumors, rejection, and taking personal belongings. Based on these findings, girls do seem to use relational aggression more than boys.

In addition, recent international research shows that both genders tend to use relational aggression, but girls are more aware and distressed by it.&lt;ref&gt;French, D. C., Jansen, E. A., &amp; Pidada, S. (2002). United States and Indonesian children's and adolescents' reports of relational aggression by disliked peers. Child Development, 73(4), 1143-1150. {{doi|10.1111/1467-8624.00463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galen, B. R., &amp; Underwood, M. K. (1997). A developmental investigation of social aggression among children. Developmental Psychology, 33(4), 589-600. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.33.4.589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paquette, J. A., &amp; Underwood, M. K. (1999). Gender differences in young adolescents' experiences of peer victimization: Social and physical aggression. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly: Journal of Developmental Psychology, 45(2), 242-266.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study by Horn&lt;ref&gt;Horn, S.S.(2003). Adolescents' reasoning about exclusion from social groups. ''Developmental psychology, 39''(1), 71-84.&lt;/ref&gt; found that girls are more likely to say that it is morally wrong to exclude someone based on their crowd membership.

Some research shows that there are certain implications when boys and girls engage in gender-atypical aggression, as girls who are more physically aggressive or boys who are highly relationally aggressive are more maladjusted than their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Nicki R. "Engagement in gender normative versus nonnormative forms of aggression: Links to social–psychological adjustment." Developmental Psychology, v. 33 issue 4, 1997, p. 610-617.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociometric status ==

[[Sociometric status]], commonly referred as [[popularity]], is one of the most significant predictors of victimization or bullying as differences in popularity can be associated with differences in social power. It is commonly believed that aggressive adolescents belong to rejected social groups. However, some research shows that they can be popular among their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, A., Bukowski, W. M., Hymel, S., &amp; Sippola, L. K. (2000). Coping with daily hassles in the peer group during early adolescence: Variations as a function of peer experience. Journal of Research on Adolescence, 10(2), 211-243. {{doi|10.1207/SJRA1002_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bukowski, W. M., Sippola, L. K., &amp; Newcomb, A. F. (2000). Variations in patterns of attraction of same- and other-sex peers during early adolescence. Developmental Psychology, 36(2), 147-154. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.36.2.147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodkin et al. (2000),&lt;ref&gt;Rodkin, P. C., Farmer, T. W., Pearl, R., &amp; Van Acker, R. (2000). Heterogeneity of popular boys: Antisocial and prosocial configurations. Developmental Psychology, 36(1), 14-24. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.36.1.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, describes two types of popular boys: "model" boys, who are "physically and academically competent, friendly and neither shy nor aggressive."&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008" /&gt; Second type is described as "tough" and such adolescents are "aggressive, physically competent, and average or below average in friendliness, academic competence, and shyness.".&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008" /&gt; Usually the more popular aggressive adolescents use instrumental aggression and not reactive aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Little, T. D., Brauner, J., Jones, S. M., Nock, M. K., &amp; Hawley, P. H. (2003). Rethinking aggression: A typological examination of the functions of aggression. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly: Journal of Developmental Psychology, 49(3), 343-369. {{doi|10.1353/mpq.2003.0014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prinstein, M. J., &amp; Cillessen, A. H. N. (2003). Forms and functions of adolescent peer aggression associated with high levels of peer status. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly: Journal of Developmental Psychology, 49(3), 310-342. {{doi|10.1353/mpq.2003.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumental aggression is defined as behavior that is deliberate and planned while reactive aggression is unplanned and impulsive.&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008" /&gt;
Relational aggression can be greatly instrumental for maintaining the popularity status of a group among other groups, as well specific relationship and status dynamics inside a group. Ojala and Nesdale (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Ojala, K., &amp; Nesdale, D. (2004). Bullying and social identity: The effects of group norms and distinctiveness threat on attitudes towards bullying. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 22(1), 19-35.&lt;/ref&gt; found that both victims and bullies normally come from rejected groups. Bullies chose to bully students, who are members of their social out-groups that are similar to their own in- group as a result of threatened distinctiveness. Hence, the need to maintain a unique social identity and status can be one of the causes to engage in bullying.
Using relational aggression to maintain a particular social order inside the group has been mostly observed in girl groups: if some member of the group becomes too popular and this causes imbalance in the group, other members might start rumors about the overly popular girl to diminish her status.&lt;ref&gt;Merten, D.(1997). The meaning of meanness: Popularity, competition, and conflict among junior high school girls. ''Sociology of Education, 70,''175-191&lt;/ref&gt;
Amanda Rose (2004)&lt;ref name="Rose 2004"&gt;Rose, A. J., Swenson, L. P., &amp; Waller, E. M. (2004). Overt and Relational Aggression and Perceived Popularity: Developmental Differences in Concurrent and Prospective Relations. Developmental Psychology, 40(3), 378-387. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.40.3.378}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the main purpose of using relational aggression in first place is to enhance or maintain one's social status. Many skills that are needed to be popular are also essential for being "successful" at employing relational aggression, e.g. ability to "read" people and adjust one's behavior accordingly, etc.&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008" /&gt; The researcher suggests that some aggressive boys are popular because they are also good at using relational aggression, and, therefore, their primary reason for popularity is not their physical but relational aggression.

== Different participation roles ==

Research shows that there are three types of rejected or [[unpopularity|unpopular]] adolescents who are very likely to be involved in bullying behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman, K. L., &amp; Wargo, J. B. (1995). Predicting the longitudinal course associated with aggressive-rejected, aggressive (nonrejected), and rejected (nonaggressive) status.

Developmental Psychology, 28(2), 231-241. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.28.2.231}}&lt;/ref&gt; First type includes adolescents who are overly aggressive: they tend to get into fights, get involved in antisocial activities, and are often involved in bullying; second type includes adolescents who are withdrawn or timid and exceedingly shy and inhibited and who are more likely to be victims; third- aggressive- withdrawn- type adolescents tend to have trouble controlling their hostility, but they are also very shy and nervous about initiating friendships. The latter are likely to be bully-victims. Other students- bystanders can also choose between several roles: victim-defender, bully-reinforcer and/or assistant, and outsiders.

=== Victims ===

Victims or the unpopular withdrawn children are excessively anxious, lack social skills needed to initiate new contacts or break into a group activity.&lt;ref name="Rubin 1990"&gt;Rubin, K., LeMare, L., &amp; Lollis, S. (1990). Social withdrawal in childhood: Developmental pathways to peer rejection. In S. Asher &amp; J. Coie (Eds.), ''Peer rejection in childhood,'' pp. 217-249.

Stability and change of behavior in connection with bullying in schools. Aggressive Behav. 1998;24:205-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common underlying reasons for bullying include low socioeconomic status, disability, and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, L. J., Wolke, D., Page, A. S., Horwood, J. P., &amp; the ALSPAC Study Team (2006). Obesity and bullying: Different effects for boys and girls.

Associations between overweight and obesity with bullying behaviors in school-aged children. Pediatrics, 113, 1187-1194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singer, E. (2005). The strategies adopted by Dutch children with dyslexia to maintain their self-esteem when teased at school. Journal of Learning Disabilities, 38, 411-423.&lt;/ref&gt;
Research shows that in comparison with other adolescents victims often use worse problem solving strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, T. (2009) Bullying and victimisation in school children: the role of social identity, problem-solving style, and family and school context. Social Psychology of Education, 12(1), 63 - 76.&lt;/ref&gt; They often score less than their bullies and defenders in the tests of moral competence and [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Gini 2011"&gt;Gini, G., Pozzoli, T., &amp; Hauser, M. (2011). Bullies have enhanced moral competence to judge relative to victims, but lack moral compassion. Personality and Individual Differences, 50(5), 603-608.&lt;/ref&gt; Moral competence refers to the ability to carefully consider both the consequences and prior beliefs in determining how morally right or wrong one's actions are. Victims seemed to focus primarily on the outcomes and not being as good in integrating the moral beliefs. They have difficulties in social skills, and social problem solving, as well as emotional regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Champion, K., Vernberg, E., &amp; Shipman, K. (2003). Nonbullying victims of bullies: Aggression, social skills, and friendship characteristics. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 24(5), 535-551.&lt;/ref&gt; And because of their lack of social competence, victims score low on peer acceptance and popularity.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996"&gt;Salmivalli, C., Lagerspetz, K., Bjorkqvist, K., Osterman, K., &amp; et al. (1996). Bullying as a group process: Participant roles and their relations to social status within the group. Aggressive Behavior, 22(1), 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulton 1994"&gt;Boulton, M. J., &amp; Smith, P. K. (1994). Bully/victim problems in middle-school children: Stability, self-perceived competence, peer perceptions and peer acceptance. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 12(3), 315-329.&lt;/ref&gt; Victims are often overly sensitive to being rejected, which might originate in their relationships with parents.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, G., Lebolt, A., Rincon, C., &amp; Freitas, A. L. (1998). Rejection sensitivity and children's interpersonal difficulties. Child Development, 69(4), 1074-1091. {{doi|10.2307/1132363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bullies ===

Bullies, despite being quite morally competent, tend to engage in morally wrong behaviors because of several reasons, including a lack of moral compassion.&lt;ref name="Gini 2011" /&gt; In general, bullies seem to engage in a kind of cold cognition and have a good theory of mind. They also have an average to good social intelligence.&lt;ref name="Gini 2011" /&gt; These skills seem to be especially important in order to use relational aggression in an instrumental manner—for achieving specific social goals.
As mentioned previously, male and female bullies usually score differently on sociometric measures. Male bullies often fall in the socially rejected category&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulton 1994" /&gt; while female bullies tend to fall in the controversial category. They can be popular yet not liked.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt;

==== Hostile attributional bias ====

Many unpopular aggressive kids seem to engage in hostile attributional bias when analyzing the actions of others: they are more likely to interpret other children's behavior as hostile while it is not,&lt;ref&gt;Crick, N. R., &amp; Dodge, K. A. (1994). A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children's social adjustment. Psychological Bulletin, 115(1), 74-101. {{doi|10.1037/0033-2909.115.1.74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, K. A., &amp; Coie, J. D. (1987). Social-information-processing factors in reactive and proactive aggression in children's peer groups. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53(6), 1146-1158. {{doi|10.1037/0022-3514.53.6.1146}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can cause the perpetuation of their aggressive behaviors.

=== Bully-victims ===

Bully- victims are people who have both experienced aggression directed towards them and have themselves engaged in [[bullying]]. They often choose to be [[Relational aggression#Bystanders|bully assistants or reinforcers]].&lt;ref name="Oh 2009"&gt;Oh, I., &amp; Hazler, R. J. (2009). Contributions of personal and situational factors to bystanders' reactions to school bullying. School Psychology International, 30(3), 291-310.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing others victimized can serve as a buffer against some psychological problems, for which these people are at risk (see  [[#Consequences of victimization|Consequences of victimization]] below). In comparison to all other groups, bully-victims are the worst off regarding their psychological adjustment and problems. They are least liked among the peers.&lt;ref name="Nansel 2001" /&gt;

=== Bystanders ===

Although early research has mostly focused on victims and bullies, currently more and more attention has been given to the roles of other students, or bystanders: bully-reinforcer's and assistants, victim-defenders, and outsiders.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt;

==== Bully-reinforcers and assistants ====

Bully-reinforcers and assistants do not normally initiate aggressive actions themselves, but they support, reinforce, and/or assist the bully. They often have rather large friendship networks when compared to outsiders, victims, and their defenders.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; These individuals are similar to bullies in regards of their personal characteristics. Female bully- reinforcers and assistants usually score low on social acceptance and high on rejection by their peers while male bully assistants have average scores on both and bully- reinforcers are often quite popular among their peers.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; The characteristic that is common among all these individuals across both genders is low level of empathy.&lt;ref name="Oh 2009" /&gt;

==== Victim-defenders ====

Victim-defenders are individuals who stand up for the victim. They are usually popular among their peers,&lt;ref name="Gini 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; although occasionally rejected and victimized adolescents take on the defender's role.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; Defenders like to befriend other defenders and usually belong to the smallest social network of all other previously mentioned groups.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; Defenders have both advanced moral competence and high level of compassion. They also score high on the theory of mind tests. They are usually very morally engaged, have a high sense of responsibility, and self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Gini 2011" /&gt; They are also good at emotion regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Maede, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Outsiders ====

Outsiders are adolescents who like to stay away from the conflict situations, participate in spreading rumors, or actively support either side. They usually befriend other outsiders. Both male and female outsiders usually score below average on both social acceptance and rejection by their peers.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt;
In general, the best predictor for whether an adolescent will choose to be a defender or an outsider in a particular situation is their relationship to the victim and/or bully.&lt;ref name="Oh 2009" /&gt; Occasionally, adolescents will feel more comfortable to intervene if they are friends of the offender.&lt;ref&gt;Tisak, M. S., &amp; Tisak, J. (1996). Expectations and judgments regarding bystanders' and victims' responses to peer aggression among early adolescents. Journal of Adolescence, 19(4), 383-392.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in general they will take the side of the bully or victim based on who they know better.&lt;ref&gt;Chaux, E. (2005). Role of Third Parties in Conflicts Among Colombian Children and Early Adolescents. Aggressive Behavior, 31(1), 40-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullies are more likely to be friends of other bullies, as well as their reinforcers, and assistants, while victims befriend other victims.

== Consequences of victimization ==

{{Main|Victimization}}
There are serious negative consequences associated with being involved in any aggressive behaviors. And while problems with peers might be a result of one's poor [[social skills]] and maladjustment, difficulty making friends, and regular experience of aggression can also be a cause of many short and long term negative consequences on one's [[mental health]] and academic and professional achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Bagwell, C., Newcomb, A., &amp; Bukowski, W. (1998). Preadolescent friendship and peer rejection as predictors of adult adjustment. ''Child Development, 69'', 140-153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brendgen, M., Vitaro, F., &amp; Bukowski, W. M.

Paper presented at biennial meetings of Society for Research in Child Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;
Experience of relational aggression, peer rejection, and unpopularity are shown to be linked to various problems in adolescence, which are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;Morison, P., &amp; Masten, A. S. (1991). Peer reputation in middle childhood as a predictor of adaptation in adolescence: A seven-year follow-up.Child Development, 62(5), 991-1007. {{doi|10.2307/1131148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, J.

* behavior problems;
* poor [[social skills]];
* lack of close peer relationships;
* difficulties in academic performance;
* low school engagement;
* [[Social undermining|undermined]] feelings of competence;
* low [[self-esteem]]
* occasionally distress due to victimization can also result in physical symptoms such as wetting, abdominal pain, or/and headaches.&lt;ref&gt;Twemlow, S. W., Fonagy, P., Sacco, F. C., &amp; Brethour, J. R. (2006). Teachers Who Bully Students: A Hidden Trauma. International Journal of Social Psychiatry, 52(3), 187-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some negative effects persist into adulthood. In a longitudinal study, Dan Olweus (2003)&lt;ref name="Olweus 2003" /&gt; found that young adults, who were victims of bullying in adolescence, had more symptoms of depression and lower self-esteem than did their non-victimized peers. Victims are also much more likely to engage in heavy smoking later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Niemelä, S., Brunstein-Klomek, A., Sillanmäki, L., Helenius, H., Piha, J., Kumpulainen, K., ,...Sourander, A.

(2004). Violence in the transition to adulthood: Adolescent victimization, education, and socioeconomic attainment in later life.

=== Differences in consequences of victimization for victims and bully-victims ===

There are differences in consequences among the children who are rejected and aggressive, also known as [[Relational aggression#Bully-victims|bully-victims]], and children who are rejected and withdrawn, also referred to as simply [[Relational aggression#Victims|victims]]. Aggressive individuals often have [[Conduct disorder|conduct problems]] and are involved in [[Antisocial behavior|antisocial activity]].;&lt;ref name="French 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, S.

=== Suicide ideation and attempts ===

Although victims respond to bullying in various ways, some of the most common ways include avoidance or escape behaviors, such as not going to school and running away from home. However, in some extreme cases, suicide attempts might occur.&lt;ref&gt;Batsche, G. M., &amp; Knoff, H. M. (1994). Bullies and their victims: Understanding a pervasive problem in the schools. School Psychology Review, 23(2), 165-174.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to non-victims, victims exhibit increased levels of [[Suicide ideation|suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holt, M. K., Finkelhor, D., &amp; Kantor, G. K. (2007). Multiple victimization experiences of urban elementary school students: Associations with psychosocial functioning and academic performance. Child Abuse &amp; Neglect, 31(5), 503-515. {{doi|10.1016/j.chiabu.2006.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rigby, K., &amp; Slee, P. (1999). Suicidal ideation among adolescent school children, involvement in bully–victim problems, and perceived social support. Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 29(2), 119-130.&lt;/ref&gt; and are more likely to have attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, M. E., Neumark-Sztainer, D., &amp; Story, M. (2003). Associations of weight-based teasing and emotional well-being among adolescents. Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine, Î51, 733-738.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim 2005"&gt;Kim, Y. S., Koh, Y. J., &amp; Leventhal, B.(2005). School bullying and suicidal risk in Korean middle school students. Pediatrics, IIS, .Í57-363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, C, Guerin, S., Lynch, E., Daly, 1., &amp; Eitzpatrick, C. (2004). The relationship between bullying, depression and suicidal thoughts/behaviour in Irish adolescents. Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine, 21, 112-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Y.S. Kim (2005)&lt;ref name="Kim 2005" /&gt; found that there are some gender differences as victimized female but not male students were at significantly greater risk for suicidal ideation.
Further research has shown that increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempts depend on a specific interaction between gender, frequency, and type of aggression. Relational or indirect aggression was found to be associated with depression and suicidal ideation among both genders.&lt;ref&gt;van der Wal, M. F., de Wit, C. A., &amp; Hirasing, R. A. (2003). Psychosocial health among young victims and offenders of direct and
indirect bullying, fpi/wfna, ÎÎÎ, 1312-1317.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brustein and Klomek (2007),&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007" /&gt; victimization at any frequency increased the risk of depression, ideation, and attempts among girls, while only frequent victimization increased the risk of depression and ideation among males; yet, Katliala-Heino et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Kaltiala-Heino R, Rimpela M, Marttunen M, Rimpela A, Rantanen P. (1999).Bullying, depression, and suicidal ideation in Finnish adolescents: school survey. BMJ. 1999;319:348-351.&lt;/ref&gt; found that severe ideation was associated with frequent victimization only among girls.

== Environmental buffers and prevention programs ==

Some adolescents are more resilient to victimization due to their personal characteristics, but there are some environmental factors such as having a best friend or great family support can decrease the risk for many negative consequences associated with victimization.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, E. V. E., Boivin, M., Vitaro, F., &amp; Bukowski, W. M. (1999). The power of friendship: Protection against an escalating cycle of peer victimization. Developmental Psychology, 35(1), 94-101. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.35.1.94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research shows that support from teachers can be a significant environmental factor for higher academic achievement and school engagement. It can also increase general [[Emotional well-being|well- being]] in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Brewster, A. B., &amp; Bowen, G. L. (2004). Teacher Support and the School Engagement of Latino Middle and High School Students at Risk of School Failure. Child &amp; Adolescent Social Work Journal, 21(1), 47-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Teacher attitudes towards bullying were found to moderate the extent to which victims internalize and feel distressed and express it by avoiding school and similar behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Flaspohler, P. D., Elfstrom, J. L., Vanderzee, K. L., Sink, H. E., &amp; Birchmeier, Z. (2009). Stand by me: The effects of peer and teacher support in mitigating the impact of bullying on quality of life. ''Psychology in the Schools, 46''(7), 636-649.&lt;/ref&gt; Close teacher- student relationship moderates perceived safety in the classroom, and higher perceived safety is directly linked to better classroom concentration and improved coping strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Boulton, M. J., Duke, E., Holman, G., Laxton, E., Nicholas, B., Spells, R., ,...Woodmansey, H. (2009). Associations between being bullied, perceptions of safety in classroom and playground, and relationship with teacher among primary school pupils. Educational Studies, 35(3), 255-267.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, supportive friends, family, and teachers can be great buffers for victimized students against all negative effects of victimization.
Witnessing the harassment of others can also reduce some harmful effects of being victimized:&lt;ref&gt;Nishina, A., &amp; Juvonen, J. (2005). Daily Reports of Witnessing and Experiencing Peer Harassment in Middle School. Child Development, 76(2), 435-450. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00855.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; victims-only feel more humiliated and angry than victims-witnesses on the same day. Being singled out and picked on feels worse than being one of many victimized students. This explains why in ethnically diverse schools victimized students experience worse psychological outcomes when their ethnic group is in majority, because then they are more likely to attribute it to their personal shortcomings and not to their group membership.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S., Bellmore, A., Nishina, A., &amp; Juvonen, J. (in press)."It must be me": Ethnic context and attributions for peer victimization.''Child Development''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevention programs ===

There are many prevention programs, which have been designed to improve social skills of the unpopular and victimized adolescents. Prevention programs usually focus on one of the three strategies:
# teaching social skills like self-expression, leadership, and questioning of others about themselves;&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, J., &amp; de Armaa, A. (1989). Social relationships in adolescence: Skill development and training. In J. Worell &amp; F. Danner (Eds.), ''The adolescent as decision-maker.'' San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Repinski, D., &amp; Leffert, N. (1994, February). Adolescents' relations with friends: The effects of a psychoeducational intervention. Paper presented in the biennial meetings of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt;
# have unpopular adolescents participate in group activities together with the popular adolescents under supervision of psychologists;
# some programs focus on training on how to combine and use one's [[Cognition|cognitive]] and behavioral abilities, including social [[problem solving]].&lt;ref&gt;Kusche, C. A. &amp; Greenberg, M. T. (1994, 2011, 2012). The PATHS Curriculum. South Deerfield, MA: Channing-Bete Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weissberg, R. P., Caplan, M., &amp; Harwood, R. L. (1991). Promoting competent young people in competence-enhancing environments: A systems-based perspective on primary prevention. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 59(6), 830-841. {{doi|10.1037/0022-006X.59.6.830}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Different types of programs have shown to have somewhat different effects: the first type seems to best improve adolescent's ability to get along with others while the second type has shown to improve adolescents' [[self-conception]]s and their acceptance by others.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman, K. L., &amp; Furman, W. (1984). The effects of social skills training and peer involvement on the social adjustment of pre-adolescents. Child Development, 55(1), 151-162. {{doi|10.2307/1129841}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the examples of the programs using the third approach is [http://www.channing-bete.com/prevention-programs/paths/paths.html PATHS (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies)] teaches skills needed for successfully analyzing social situations, controlling one's negative emotions, and making more [[Rationality|rational]] social decisions. It has been shown to successfully reduce behavioral problems among elementary school children.&lt;ref&gt;Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group (1999). Initial impact of the Fast Track Prevention Trial for Conduct Problems, II: Classroom effects. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,'' 67, 648-657&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it is difficult to prevent relational aggression from happening as often adolescents who use it are seen to be more popular among their peers.&lt;ref name="Rose 2004" /&gt;

== Richard's Bicycle Book ==
Ballantine's ''Richard's Bicycle Book'', first published in 1972, appeared at a time when cycling was experiencing a resurgence in popularity due in part to the oil shortages of the [[1973 oil crisis|world oil crisis]] and the appearance of lightweight road bicycles. The book was a cornucopia of cycling-related information; it not only contained an overview of the [[history of the bicycle]], explanations of differing bicycle designs and types and various bicycle accessories, guides to basic bicycle maintenance and fitting among others, but was heavily laced with the author's own views and humour to boot.

The ''Bicycle Book'' also introduced many new cyclists to the world of commuting and [[bicycle touring]] and was also an early example of [[Cycling advocacy|bicycle advocacy]]. In a section on road cycling, commuting, and etiquette, Ballantine firmly stated his view that cyclists, as lawful road users, had an absolute right to share existing roads, and that the safe travel of all users should take precedence in designing new streets and thoroughfares.

Over the years, ''Richard's Bicycle Book'' has been through several incarnations such as ''Richard's New Bicycle Book'' (1987) and  ''Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book'' (2000).

== Ballantine and the HPV movement ==
Ballantine was prominent in the [[human powered vehicle]] movement from its inception in the 1980s and active in the HPV racing movement.

He was chairman of the [http://www.bhpc.org.uk British Human Power Club] and of the [http://www.whpva.org World Human Powered Vehicle Association].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chairman|url=http://www.bhpc.org.uk/chairman.aspx|work=British Human Power Club website|publisher=The British Human Power Club|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smithsonian Theaters''' is an operating unit of [[Smithsonian Enterprises]], the revenue-generating business division for the Smithsonian Institution, United States.

The unit operates three [[IMAX]] theaters and one Infiniti Digital Dome Planetarium, each presenting shows relevant to the museum in which it is located.  The Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater is the flagship facility of Smithsonian Theaters, and is located on the first floor of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] National Mall Campus.  It plays films related to aviation and space. The theater is host to lectures on topics spanning the purview of the museum.  [[John Glenn]] hosts a lecture each year, and series by [[GE]], [[Boeing]], and others draw hundreds and sometimes thousands of attendees.

The Airbus IMAX Theater is located at the National Air and Space Museum Stephen F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.  This newest IMAX theatre plays content similar to her sister facility on the National Mall.  Named for [[Airbus SAS]] due to a $6 million donation, the theater doesn't host as many events due to its location near Dulles International Airport (a 45-minute drive from the National Mall).

The Johnson IMAX Theater is located in the [[National Museum of Natural History]] on the National Mall, three blocks from the Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater.  The shows played at this theater are relevant to the content of the museum. The Johnson Theater hosts special showings throughout the evening hours. Special events in the museum often overflow into the theater, and as such, Johnson Theater is often used for corporate and large-group events.

The Albert Einstein Planetarium is located in the National Air and Space Museum, and presents movies to visitors in high definition on its Sky Vision Dual Projection Digital Dome System.  The screen is on the ceiling, and the movie plays on all parts of the dome (360 degrees) throughout the show. Certain days of the week, there is a free admission show known as "The Stars Tonight" in which the traditional planetarium equipment is utilized to give visitors a sky watching experience in the museum.

'''''TV Guide''{{'}}s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time''' is ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s list of the 50 most entertaining or influential television series in American pop culture. It appeared in the May 4–10, 2002 issue of the magazine, which was the second in a series of special issues commemorating ''TV Guide''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 50th year (the others were "TV We'll Always Remember", "50 Greatest Covers", "[[List of television shows considered the worst|50 Worst TV Shows of All Time]]", "50 Greatest Cartoon Characters" and "50 Sexiest Stars"). The list was also counted down in an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television special]], ''TV Guide's 50 Best Shows of All Time'', on May 13, 2002.

The 50 entries, chosen and ranked by the editors of ''TV Guide'', consist of regularly scheduled series spanning more than half a century of television.

[[Benjamin Spock]]'s '''''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care''''' is one of the best-selling books of the twentieth century, selling 500,000 copies in the six months after its initial publication in 1946, and 50 million by the time of Spock’s death in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Maier, ''Dr. Spock: An American Life'' (New York: Basic Books, 2003), 462.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2011, the book had been translated into 39 languages.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Hidalgo, "[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14534094 Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care at 65]," ''BBC World Service,'' 23 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spock and his manual helped revolutionize child-rearing methods for the post-World War II generation.  Mothers heavily relied on Spock’s advice and appreciated his friendly, reassuring tone.&lt;ref name="Maier, 142"&gt;Maier, 142.&lt;/ref&gt;  Spock emphasizes in his book that, above all, parents should have confidence in their abilities and trust their instincts.  The famous first line of the book reads, “Trust yourself.  You know more than you think you do.”&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Spock, ''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care'' (New York: Duell, Sloan, and Pearce, 1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Child care before Spock===
Spock’s book helped revolutionize child care in the 1940s and 1950s.  Prior to this, rigid schedules permeated pediatric care.  Influential authors like behavioral psychologist [[John B. Watson]], who wrote ''Psychological Care of Infant and Child'' in 1928, and pediatrician [[Luther Emmett Holt]], who wrote ''The Care and Feeding of Children: A Catechism for the Use of Mothers and Children's Nurses'' in 1894, told parents to feed babies on strict schedules and start [[toilet training]] at an early, specific age.&lt;ref&gt;John Watson, ''Psychological Care of Infant and Child,'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luther Emmett Holt, ''The Care and Feeding of Children,'' (New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1894).&lt;/ref&gt;  Watson, Holt, and other child care experts obsessed over rigidity because they believed that irregularities in feeding and bowel movements were causing the widespread diarrheal diseases seen among babies in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Spock, "How My Ideas Have Changed," ''Redbook,'' October 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, these experts, whose ideas were embodied in ''Infant Care'' pamphlets distributed by the U.S. government, warned against “excessive” affection by parents for their children.&lt;ref name="infant care"&gt;United States Department of Labor, "Infant Care," ''Infant Care,'' Washington, DC (1922).&lt;/ref&gt;  To maintain sterility and to prevent children from becoming spoiled or fussy, these experts recommended kissing children only on the forehead and limiting hugs or other displays of affection.&lt;ref&gt;Watson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holt.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intent===
As a practicing pediatrician in the 1930s, Spock noticed that prevailing methods in pediatric care seemed cruel and ignored the emotional needs of the child.  He wanted to explore the psychological reasons behind common problems seen during practices like [[breastfeeding]] and toilet training, in order to give less arbitrary advice to mothers who came to his practice.  He thus became trained in [[psychoanalysis]], emerging as the first pediatrician with a psychoanalytic background.  Seeking useful ways to implement Freudian philosophy into child-rearing practices, Spock would try out his advice on patients and their mothers, continuously seeking their response.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;  He contradicted contemporary norms in child care by supporting flexibility instead of rigidity and encouraging parents to show affection for their children.&lt;ref&gt;Spock, "How My Ideas Have Changed."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Spock was approached to write a child-care manual in 1938 by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], he did not yet feel certain enough of his professional abilities to accept the offer.  Eventually, though, after several more years of giving advice to mothers, Spock felt more convinced of his advice and published a paperback copy of ''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care'' in 1946 with [[Pocket Books]].&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Spock and Mary Morgan, ''Spock on Spock: A Memoir of Growing up With the Century'' (New York: Pantheon Books, 1989), 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  His intent in writing the book was to disseminate comprehensive information to all mothers, giving advice that combined the physical and psychological aspects of child care.  So that any mother could afford it, the book was sold at just twenty-five cents.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care'' is arranged by topics corresponding to the child’s age, ranging from infancy to teenage years.  Drawn from his career as a pediatrician, Spock's advice is comprehensive, dealing with topics such as preparing for the baby, toilet training, school, illnesses, and "special problems" like "separated parents" and "the fatherless child".&lt;ref&gt;Spock, ''Baby and Child Care.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike leading child care experts prior to the 1940s, Spock supports flexibility in child-rearing, advising parents to treat each child as an individual.  Drawing on his psychoanalytic training, he explains the behavior and motivations of children at each stage of growth, allowing parents to make their own decisions about how to raise their children.  For example, Spock has an entire chapter devoted to "The One-Year-Old," in which he explains that babies at this age like to explore the world around them.  He then suggests ways to arrange the house and prevent accidents with a "wandering baby."&lt;ref&gt;Spock, ''Baby and Child Care,'' 207-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spock emphasizes that ultimately, the parents’ “natural loving care” for their children is most important.&lt;ref&gt;Spock,''Baby and Child Care,'' 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  He reminds parents to have confidence in their abilities and to trust their common sense; his practice as a pediatrician had proven to him that parents' instincts were usually best.&lt;ref&gt;Spock, ''Baby and Child Care,'' 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revised editions==
During Spock’s lifetime, seven editions of his book were published.  Several co-authors have helped revise the book since the fifth edition.  Since Spock’s death in 1998, two more editions have been published.

Each subsequent edition of the book brings medical information up-to-date.  Other revisions have emerged to deal with contemporary social issues, such as daycare and gay parenting.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second edition, Spock emphasizes in several new chapters the importance of “firm but gentle” control of children.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, 206.&lt;/ref&gt;  He warns against self-demand feeding, a type of feeding that had become popular in the 1940s.  Because parents were letting their baby dictate when he or she should be fed, some parents began indulging all of their child’s desires, resulting in unregulated sleep schedules and a loss of control for the parents.  Spock clarifies in his manual that while parents should respect their children, they also must ask for respect in return.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, 206-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fourth edition, Spock adapts to society’s shifting ideas of gender equality, especially after the rise of the [[women's liberation movement]] and concurrent feminist criticisms about sexism apparent in ''Baby and Child Care''.  Spock changed every pronoun for the baby, previously referred to only as “he,” and discusses ways for parents to minimize [[Gender role|gender stereotyping]] while raising a child.&lt;ref name="Spock and Morgan, 247"&gt;Spock and Morgan, 247.&lt;/ref&gt;   He warns against praising girls only on their appearance and notes the sexism present in a household where girls learn to do housework while boys play outside.  Spock also continues to expand on the role of fathers and acknowledges that parents should have an equal share in child-rearing responsibilities, while also both having the right to work.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventh edition, Spock endorses a low-fat, plant-based diet for children due to rising trends in obesity and Spock’s own switch to a [[macrobiotic diet]] after facing serious health issues.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Within a year of being published, ''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care'' had already sold 750,000 copies, mostly by word-of-mouth advertising.&lt;ref name="Spock and Morgan, 137"&gt;Spock and Morgan, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;   Mothers appreciated that Spock was not condescending in his writing and instead very empathetic towards mothers, acknowledging how tiresome child care can be.&lt;ref name="Maier, 142"/&gt;  Although he believed that much of a child’s personality and behavior rested in the parents’ hands, he did not scare parents with this large responsibility of raising a "good" child, like earlier child care experts had.&lt;ref&gt;Spock and Morgan, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;   He was lauded for writing with a friendly, reassuring tone and using conversational, easy-to-read language.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences,'' 2nd ed.., s.v. "Spock, Benjamin 1903-1998."&lt;/ref&gt;

Spock was popularized by mentions in household magazines and famous television shows, such as ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', where the characters [[Lucy and Ricky Ricardo]] were seen consulting Spock’s manual in various episodes when seeking advice for raising their child.&lt;ref name="Spock and Morgan, 137"/&gt;   Spock quickly became a household name in the 1950s and is frequently credited for helping to raise a generation of “Spock babies” in the post-war period.  Mothers heavily relied on his advice; by 1956, ''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care'' was already selling a million copies each year.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s, however, book sales quickly slowed due to Spock’s tarnished reputation after his publicized involvement in protests of the [[Vietnam War]].  Skepticism of his work increased, especially among colleagues, who criticized Spock for not being a serious academic researcher and relying too heavily on anecdotal evidence in his book.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, Spock faced widespread criticism for condoning an overly permissive parenting style.  Many commentators blamed Spock for helping to create the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].  Critics believed the current youth were rebellious and defiant in part because they had been brought up by ''Baby and Child Care''.  Spock, however, continued to defend himself, saying he had always believed in firm leadership by parents.&lt;ref&gt;Spock and Morgan, 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, with the rise of the women's liberation movement, feminists began to publicly criticize Spock for the sexist philosophy apparent in his book.  Spock was thus forced to confront his own ideas about gender roles and gender stereotyping.&lt;ref name="Spock and Morgan, 247"/&gt;

Near the end of his life, Spock’s changing ideas were reflected alongside technological and social changes in the seventh and final edition of his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/22/weekinreview/word-for-word-dr-spock-time-change-baby-advice-evolution-child-care-icon.html|title=Word for Word / Dr. Spock; Time to Change the Baby Advice: Evolution of a Child-Care Icon|date=22 March 1998|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His advocacy for a [[vegan]] diet drew criticism from some nutritionists and pediatricians, including co-author Dr. Steven J. Parker, as being too extreme.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-06-25/news/9806250298_1_soy-milk-dairy-products-fruit&lt;/ref&gt;  Health and science columnist [[Jane Brody]] referenced the ''Pediatric Nutrition Handbook'' of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics|AAP]] in arguing that a vegan diet for young children could result in nutritional deficiencies unless carefully planned, something which would be difficult for working parents.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Brody, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/30/science/personal-health-feeding-children-off-the-spock-menu.html Personal Health]," ''The New York Times,'' 30 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Baby and Child Care'' popularized new ideas about child care in the years following [[World War II]], encouraging flexibility, common sense, affection, and Freudian philosophy.  Spock’s reassuring advice gave parents the confidence to use their best judgment to raise their children.&lt;ref&gt;Spock and Morgan, 241.&lt;/ref&gt;   Spock also masked Freudian explanations of children’s behavior in plainspoken language to avoid offending his readers, making [[Freud]] accessible to mainstream America.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine praised Spock, noting that “perhaps no other person has so influenced an entire nation’s ideas about babies…His views have brought naturalness, common sense, reassurance, Sigmund Freud and even joy to parents all over the world.”&lt;ref&gt;Gereon Zimmermann, "A Visit With Dr. Spock," ''Look,'' 21 July 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spock’s optimistic book reflects the hopefulness of the post-war period and society’s focus on children.  Because post-war affluence helped parents give children more opportunities, parents became more concerned with providing the best for their children.  At the same time, the widespread move to the suburbs broke up families, increasing parents’ reliance on experts’ advice over grandparents’ advice.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Spock’s reputation has changed over time, Spock continued to be a leading authority on child care until his death.  In 1990, [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine named Spock one of the 100 most important people of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, 457.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon Spock’s death in 1998, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that “babies do not arrive with owner’s manuals…. But for three generations of American parents, the next best thing was ''Baby and Child Care''…Dr. Benjamin Spock…breathed humanity and common sense into child-rearing.”&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/17/opinion/dr-spock-s-children.html Dr. Spock's Children]," ''The New York Times,'' 17 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dictionary of Imaginary Places''''' (1980, 1987, 1999) is a book written by [[Alberto Manguel]] and [[Gianni Guadalupi]]. It takes the form of a catalogue of fantasy lands, islands, cities, and other locations from world literature&amp;mdash;"a [[Baedecker]] or traveller's guide...a nineteenth-century [[gazetteer]]" for mental travelling.

==The book==
Originally published in 1980 and expanded in 1987 and 1999, the ''Dictionary'' covers the terrains that readers of literature would expect&amp;mdash;[[Ruritania]] and [[Shangri-La]], [[Kubla Khan|Xanadu]] and [[Atlantis]], [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[Land of Oz|Oz]],&lt;ref&gt;The map of Oz is derived from the map that  [[James E. Haff]] and [[Dick Martin (artist)|Dick Martin]] designed for [[The International Wizard of Oz Club]], but redrawn in squarish proportions to avoid copyright infringement. The presence of a "Davy Jones Island" on this map indicates that the inclusion of the character Davy Jones, a living wooden whale in ''[[Lucky Bucky in Oz]]'', as a decoration Martin drew on the map, was misinterpeted by the book's recartographers, as no such place appears in any Oz books up to that book's publication.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Wonderland]], [[Thomas More]]'s [[Utopia]], [[Edwin Abbott Abbott|Edwin Abbott]]'s [[Flatland]], [[C. S. Lewis]]' [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]], and the realms of [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]; and also a vast host of other venues, created by authors ranging from [[Dylan Thomas]] to [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] to [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], from [[Carl Sandburg]] to [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] to Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. (Plus the [[Marx Brothers]]' ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]],'' among other non-orthodox texts.)

To remain of manageable size, the ''Dictionary'' excludes places that are off the planet Earth (eliminating many science fiction locales), as well as "heavens and hells and places of the future," and literary pseudonyms for existing places, like the [[Yoknapatawpha County]] of [[William Faulkner]] or the [[Barsetshire]] of [[Anthony Trollope]] and [[Angela Thirkell]]. It compensates by covering a wide range of anonymous and obscure sources, and volumes of forgotten lore.

The book is widely noted for the number and excellence of its illustrations, by Graham Greenfield, and its maps and charts, by James Cook. Guadalupi and Manguel acknowledge Philip Grove's ''The Imaginary Voyage in Prose Fiction'' (1941), and Pierre Versins' ''Encyclopèdie de l'Utopie, des Voyages extraordinaires et de la Science-Fiction'' (1972), as precedents and inspirations.

==Films==
{{main article|Vampire films}}{{very long|section|date=May 2014}}
[[File:Nosferatuposter.jpg|right|thumb|A promotional poster for the 1922 film [[Nosferatu]].]]
[[File:Kyuketsuki-ga poster.jpg|thumb|The 1956 ''[[Vampire Moth]]'' was the first Japanese film in the vampire genre.]]
[[File:Dracula 1958 c.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher Lee]] portrayed [[Count Dracula]] in the celebrated [[Hammer Horror]] series of films, starting with ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]''  in 1958.]]
''[[The Vampire (1913 film)|The Vampire]]'' (1913, directed by [[Robert G. Vignola]]), also co-written by Vignola, is the earliest vampire film.

These were derived from the writer [[Rudyard Kipling]] who was inspired by a vampiress painted by [[Philip Burne-Jones]], an image typical of the era in 1897, to write his poem 'The Vampire'. Like much of Kipling's verse it was incredibly popular, and its refrain: ''A fool there was . . . '', describing a seduced man, became the title of the popular film ''[[A Fool There Was (1915 film)|A Fool There Was]]'' that made [[Theda Bara]] a star, the poem being used in its publicity. On this account, in early [[American English|American]] [[slang]] the ''femme fatale'' was called a ''vamp'', short for ''vampiress''.&lt;ref&gt;Per the Oxford English Dictionary, ''vamp'' is originally English, used first by [[G. K. Chesterton]], but popularized in the American silent film ''The Vamp'', starring [[Enid Bennett]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A vampire features in the landmark ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922 Germany, directed by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau]]), an unlicensed version of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]].'' The Stoker estate sued the production and won, leading to the destruction of most copies of the film. It would be painstakingly restored in 1994 by a team of European scholars from the five surviving prints that had escaped destruction. Nosferatu is the first film to feature a Vampire's death by [[sunlight]], which formerly only weakened vampires.

The next classic treatment of the vampire legend was in Universal's ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' starring [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Count Dracula]]. 
Five years after the release of the film, Universal released ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'', a direct sequel that starts immediately after the end of the first film. A second sequel, ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'', starring [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] followed in 1943. Despite his apparent death in the 1931 film, the Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: 1944's ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'', 1945's ''[[House of Dracula]]'' and 1948's ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. While Lugosi had played a vampire in two other movies during the 1930s and 1940s, it was only in this final film that he played Count Dracula onscreen for the second (and last) time.
 
Dracula was reincarnated for a new generation in the celebrated [[Hammer Horror]] series of films, starring [[Christopher Lee]] as the Count. The first of these films ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958) was followed by seven [[sequel]]s. Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of these.

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Vampire lovers cap.jpg|thumb|Madeleine Smith and Ingrid Pitt in ''The Vampire Lovers'']]  --&gt;
A distinct subgenre of vampire films, ultimately inspired by Le Fanu's ''Carmilla'' explored the topic of the [[lesbian vampire]]. The first of these was ''[[Blood and Roses]]'' (1960) by [[Roger Vadim]]. More explicit lesbian content was provided in [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]] Studios [[Karnstein Trilogy|Karnstein trilogy]]. The first of these, ''[[The Vampire Lovers]]'', (1970), starring [[Ingrid Pitt]] and [[Madeleine Smith]], was a relatively straightforward re-telling of LeFanu's novella, but with more overt violence and sexuality.
Later films in this subgenre such as ''[[Vampyres (film)|Vampyres]]'' (1974) became even more explicit in their depiction of sex, nudity and violence.

Beginning with the absurd ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948) the vampire film has often been the subject of comedy. ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'' (1967) by [[Academy Award]] winner [[Roman Polanski]] was a notable parody of the genre. Other comedic treatments, of variable quality, include ''[[Old Dracula]]'' (1974) featuring [[David Niven]] as a lovelorn Dracula, ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979 United States) featuring [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]'' (1995 United States, directed by [[Mel Brooks]]) with Canadian [[Leslie Nielsen]] giving it a comic twist.

Another development in some vampire films has been a change from supernatural horror to science fictional explanations of vampirism. ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' (Italy 1964, directed by [[Ubaldo Ragona]]) and ''[[The Omega Man]]'' (1971 USA, directed by [[Boris Sagal]]), both based on [[Richard Matheson]]'s novel ''I Am Legend'', are two examples. Vampirism is explained as a kind of virus in [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[Rabid (film)|Rabid]]'' (1976 Canada), ''[[Red-Blooded American Girl]]'' (1990 Canada, directed by [[David Blyth]]) and Michael and Peter Spierig's ''[[Daybreakers]]'' (2009 United States).

Race has been another theme, as exemplified by the [[blaxploitation]] picture ''[[Blacula]]'' (1972) and several sequels.

Since the time of Bela Lugosi's ''Dracula'' (1931) the vampire, male or female, has usually been portrayed as an alluring sex symbol. There is, however, a very small subgenre, pioneered in Murnau's seminal ''Nosferatu'' (1922) in which the vampire is depicted in the hideous lineaments of the creature of European folklore. [[Max Schrek]]'s disturbing portrayal of this role in Murnau's film was copied by [[Klaus Kinski]] in [[Werner Herzog]]'s remake ''[[Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht]]'' (1979). In ''[[Shadow of the Vampire]]'' (2000, directed by [[E. Elias Merhige]]), [[Willem Dafoe]] plays Max Schrek, himself, though portrayed here as an actual vampire. Dafoe's character is the ugly, disgusting creature of the original ''Nosferatu''. The main tradition has, however, been to portray the vampire in terms of a predatory sexuality. [[Christopher Lee]], [[Delphine Seyrig]], [[Frank Langella]], and [[Lauren Hutton]] are just a few examples of actors who brought great sex-appeal into their portrayal of the vampire.{{POV statement|date=May 2014}}

A major character in most vampire films is the vampire slayer, of which Stoker's [[Abraham Van Helsing]] is a prototype. However, killing vampires has changed. Where Van Helsing relied on a stake through the heart, in ''[[Vampires (1998 movie)|Vampires]]'' 1998 USA, directed by [[John Carpenter]], Jack Crow ([[James Woods]]) has a heavily armed squad of vampire hunters, and in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' (1992 USA, directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui), writer [[Joss Whedon]] (who created TV's ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and spinoff ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'') attached The Slayer, [[Buffy Summers]] ([[Kristy Swanson]] in the film, [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] in the TV series), to a network of [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watchers]] and mystically endowed her with superhuman powers.

The 1973 Serbian horror film ''[[Leptirica]]'' ("The She-Butterfly") was inspired by the story of [[Sava Savanović]].

Other notable Vampire movies also include the following, but not limited to:

* "Dracula" (1931) starred Bela Lugosi as well he starred in "Vampire Over London" (1952) both of which are B/W films.
* "The Horror of Dracula" (1958) starring Peter Cushing (playing Dr. Van Helsing) and co-stars with Christopher Lee.  Christopher Lee's saga of vampire films also includes the following as he personified Dracula in "Dracula" Prince of Darkness" (1966), "Dracula Had Risen From the Grave" (1968), "Count Dracula" plus "Taste the Blood of Dracula," and "Scars of Dracula" all in (1970).  Followed up with "Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972) -co-starring again with Peter Cushing, as Van Helsing- then "The Satanic Rites Of Dracula" with Peter Cushing (1973), and "Dracula and Son" (1976).  While Peter Cushing was also in "Vampire Lovers" (1970), "The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires" and "Tender Dracula" (1974).
* "[[The Atomic Age Vampire]]" (1960) B/W film aka  "Seddok, l’erede di Satana" starring Alberto Lupo, Susanne Loret, and Sergio Fantoni.  Directed by Anton Giulo Majano with both an Italian and English version of this film released.  A girl Jeanette Moreneau (Susanne Loret) who gets her face mangled in a car accident. Only the mysterious Dr. Levin (Alberto Lupo) can save her face...but at what cost?  (A 70-minute cartoon animated version of this film reflecting its story line was released in 2009).
* "Queen Of Blood" (1966) starred John Saxon as well as Basil Rathbone and shared two elements in common (that being a derelict spaceship that harbors a female vampiric alien played by [[Florence Marly]] as the Alien Queen) as is the case too in the much later 1985 Sci-Fi thriller called "Lifeforce."
* "Requiem for a Vampire" (1971) while a mainstream film not widely shown due to its dubious odd-ball content, the film containing full frontal nudity regarding a bizarre tale that includes bats engaged in coitus with women. This film starred Marie-Pierre Castel, Mireille Dargent, and Piilippe Gaste.
* "Horror Express" (1972) is not a vampire movie in the eyes of some, and then again it is a vampire film in the eyes of others.  Like the movie "Lifeforce" that breaks the mold of one's lifeforce or i.e. blood being drawn from a person by biting them, mysteriously drawn from their mouths, or as in this film a person's soul or spirit if you will is removed from them leaving them dead with their essence all that they were being drawn out through their eyes...  This film has a sinister character, call him vampiric or prehistoric man, or demon or devil if you will!  The idea is not rightly spelled out with this sinister character attacking passengers aboard a rail road passenger train (an idea that appears likewise to be shared to some degree in Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan's "The Strain" with its original vampire character -in this horror TV series- bearing the marks of the devil too, if you will).  "Horror Express" stars Peter Cushing, Telly Savalas, and Christopher Lee.
* "[[Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter]]" (1974) featuring Caroline Munro (in the starring role as Carla) in this UK film which also starred (Captain Kronos) Horst Janson, (Dr. Marcus) John Carson, (Grost) John Cater; as well as Shane Briant as (Paul Durwood), and others.
* "Nosferatu the Vampyre" (1979) "Werner Herzog's Nosferatue, the Vampyre portrayed by Klaus Kinski as Count Dracula a well meaning replica of Max Schreck's vampire in F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu. As well "Shadow of the Vampire" (2000) picked up the gauntlet and went further being inspired by the classic too in its  attempt to pay homage to F.W. Murnau's silent horror classic Nosferatu, while including comic elements to the classic.  All of which is also outlined above.
* A TV film called "Salem's Lot" (1979) was made starring David Soul, who was more popularly known from his TV series "Starsky and Hutch" (1975-1979). This movie was then again remade in (2004) with the same title in (2004) starring Rob Lowe.
* "Lifeforce" (1985) film that contained a lot of nudity throughout the film as a female vampire seduces and kisses men to drain out their life force and leaves them dried out like some mummified corpses.  This film has different bases for vampire folklore and has them seeded here from another planet coming here on a spaceship.  Starred Steven Railsback and Mathilda May.
* One of the first popular vampire films of its decade there came out at the theaters a movie called "Lost Boys" in (1987) which quickly became a teen hearttrob film of girls at the time.  It starred Corey Haim, Kiefer Sutherland, and Jason Patric.
* "Near Dark" (1987) starred both Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen then in (2009) Lance did another vampire movie that shared a similar plot twist although the film itself with respect to the entirety of the script was different.  However, if you've seen "Near Dark" this second film may not hold as much of a novelty as far as the plot twist goes; or vice versa if you've seen "Daybreakers" Lance's second vampire movie before "Near Dark."  Both of these actors Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen have also prominently starred together in the (1986) Sci-fi film "Aliens."
* "Bram Stoker's Dracula" (1992).  This film is based off the 1897 book.  The film starred Keanu Reeves, Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, and Anthony Hopkins.
* "Innocent Blood" (1992) contains brief nudity in a scene in opening of the feature in its theatrical release.  The film is what is considered a 'dark comedy' with the female vampire having a moral angle to kill but bad people, and thus her involvement with the mob. This film starred:  Anne Parillaud (Marie the vampire), David Proval (Lenny), Robert Luggia (Sal "The Shark"),  Rocco Sisto (Gilly), Chazz Palminteri (Tony), Anthony LaPaglia (Joe Gennaro), Don Rickless (Emanuel Bergman), and Christopher Lee (as Count Dracula).
* A somewhat more popular of the light hearted vampire films was "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" in (1992), featuring a high school girl who found herself gifted with fighting skills to kill vampires, and its spinoff TV series mentioned above.
* "Interview With the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles" (1994) starred Tom Cruise with Brad Pitt, and co-starred actors Antonio Banderas, Kirsten Dunst &amp; Christian Slater. (This film is based off an Anne Rice book as is also the movie "Queen of the Damned" mentioned below).
* "Embrace of a Vampire" (1995) a cable TV movie contains some nudity involving a human and her vampire lover with the human girl being played by Alyssa Milano in her most revealing role.
* "From Dusk till Dawn" (1996) over the top Quentin Tarantino film story which inspired a sequel film and in 2014 inspired a TV series spinoff.  This movie was notably starring Selma Hayek, George Clooney, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo, Harvey Keitel, and John Saxon.  The film opens with some wild foul statements, and outside of Ms. Hayek this movie contains some unattractive nudity in a later scene within the movie and a few less than tasteful guitars being played that are composed of human body parts; so if you get beyond that, you're into the film.  This movie now looks tame however; as far as shock effects go, as here described compared to those portrayed in the cable TV series "The Strain."
* The "Blade" (1998) and its saga of three films starring Wesley Snipes, one begins to noticeably see a change in the genre of what has been considered the original origins of vampires in popular culture (from that of its original folklore).
* "Queen of the Damned" (2002) regarding a queen vampire played by the beautiful and late actress Aaliyah.  Part of the film's plot deals with a rockstar vampire named Lestat (Stuart Townsend) whose music wakes up the Queen of the damned.  The film is based off Anne Rice novels called "The Vampire Chronicles" with the one bearing the title of this movie was published in 1988.  Her writings are also responsible for the film "Interview with the Vampire" and the book by the same title was published in 1976 the first of her vampire book series.
* "Underworld" (2003) with its saga of films - are very popular including a story line of wolf Lycans fighting vampires in a well brushed out visuals and CGI effects not completely unlike the "Twilight" saga of films that likewise have the same conflict occurring between rivaling factions of wolves and vampires.  Starring Kate Beckinsale as the leding role in this series of movies.
* "Van Helsing" (2004) starred Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale (more popularly known in the Sci-fi community for her portrayal of Selene in the "Underworld" saga of films); while this films is said to get a remake starring Tom Cruise.
* "30 Days of Night" (2007) film directed by David Slade about an Alaskan town plunged into darkness with the misfortune of there being vampires there and all mayhem breaks out.
* "I Am Legend" (2007) film starring Will Smith with a sequel in the works.  Original film is called "The Last Man on Earth" starring Vincent Price available in its original B/W release or now in a colorized version as well.  A more well known first remake was "Omega Man" starring Charlton Heston, or which inspired "I Am Legend" film that contained vampires as well as dog vampires all of which had slight zombie features too.  These films are all from a book by the title of this film outlined here; and none of the films follow what is contained in the last couple of pages of the book.  Another interesting point to note in the "Omega Man" film we find Chuck a white gentleman being the last man on earth as he meets his love interest, or passion a black woman (Rosalind Cash) the last woman on earth that has not become infected with the virus as is the rest of humanity.  While in the film version of "I Am Legend" Will Smith a black man meets a Latina women, who is the last woman apparently on earth; and they don't really get along very well. There is a DVD of "I Am Legend" which includes an alternative ending version.
* Then there are the "Twilight" saga films beginning in (2008) which also featured Native American flash backs in time as the film deals with what it calls werewolves (but would be technically 'skinwalkers') verses or in conflict with a vampire clan with one of each of them, a vampire (Robert Pattinson) playing Edward Cullen, and Native American changeling (Taylor Lautner) biding for the hand of a mortal girl Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart).  Notably there are other Native American actors in this saga of films besides Lautner with Native ancestry of (Ottawa and Potawatomi tribes, on his mother's side) playing Jacob Black, they -other natives- include Gil Birmingham (Comanche) who played Billy Black, and Julia Jones (Choctaw and Chickasaw) who played Leah Clearwater. A difference in vampires portrayed in these films (and the book series) is that they don't burn up in the sun—their skin sparkles.  They live in Washington because it is almost always overcast, so their secret is safe.  While this film became a hearttrob film for a new generation of young girl moviegoers like "Lost Boys" was of previous generations it is also a notable film to modern day Generation X and Millennials who are hardcore vampire film buffs.
* "Dracula Untold" (2014).  Vlad Tepes (Luke Evans) plays a troubled hero in that he becomes a vampire, in his case a blessing and a curse at the same time!  You see he undergoes this transformation simply because of his learning that the Sultan is shortly readying for battle and needs to muster to himself an army of 1,000 boys; those he will recruit to himself, whether they want to join or not, while one of those boys would be Vlad's own son.  Thus, Vlad vows to find a way, one way or another to protect his family at all cost; as they are all that matter to him! He learns of this mysterious cave where it is said dwells a creature of amidst strength, a vampire who can grant him this same practically invincible strength... and thus he becomes the bloodsucking Dracula destroying all enemies that would stand before him!  Directed by [[Gary Shore]], and also starring Dominic Cooper, Sarah Gadon, Charles Dance, as well as Art Parkinson.  The film is based on the character in Bram Stoker the novel.

==Folklore==
* The [[Sava Savanović]] was used in [[Milovan Glišić]]'s popular story "Posle devedeset godina" (''90 years after'').

==Gaming==

===Tabletop games===
*The Third Edition [[GURPS]] [[tabletop role-playing game system]] supplement ''Blood Types'' lists 47 different "species" of vampires describing 30 of them from both folklore and fiction in 23 listings (several are simply different names for the same type of vampire; for example the Burma's Kephn is considered a male version of the Penanggalen)
* [[Role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' (1992), in which the participants play the roles of fictional vampires (for specifics, see [[vampire (World of Darkness)|vampires in the World of Darkness]]).
* ''[[Shadowrun]]'' features vampires whose existence is explained by a resurgence of the [[Shadowrun#Races|Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus]]. As such, the afflicted are not ''undead'', but instead are still ''alive'' but radically changed by the [[retrovirus]]. They normally do not suffer from the supernatural limitations such as crosses, but still are vulnerable to sunlight.
* In the tabletop wargame ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle|Warhammer Fantasy]]'', [[Vampire Counts]] are one of the playable forces.

===Trading Card games===
* In the trading card game ''[[Magic:The Gathering]]'', vampires are quite iconic creatures of the colors black and red. Most of them share the ability to fly and to grow stronger (via +1/+1 counters) by dealing mortal damage to other creatures or to the players(according to the idea of gaining power from the blood of their victims).
* In [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game]], vampire are all zombie-type monster cards: "Patrician of Darkness", "Vampire Lord", "Vampire Lady" and "Red-Moon Baby" ("Vampire Baby" in Japanese version). In [[Yu-Gi-Oh! R]] manga, the character Tilla Mook uses the card monster "Curse of Vampire".

===Video games===
{{main article|List of vampire video games}}
[[File:Vampire Interface.png|thumb|The 1986 French video game ''Vampire'' was one of the first video games to feature vampires.]]
Video game series featuring vampires primarily use Dracula or Dracula-inspired characters. Konami's ''[[Castlevania]]'' series is the longest running series which uses the Dracula legend, though its writers have made their own alterations to the legend. An exception to this trend is the ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' video game series, which features vampires set in an entirely fictional world called Nosgoth. Video game series such as [[Konami]]'s ''[[Castlevania]]'' and [[role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Vampire: the Masquerade]]'' have been especially successful and influential.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
Other vampires seen in games include:

* ''[[BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger]]'' features Rachel Alucard as a vampire who carries a cat-like umbrella named Nago and is occupied by a red bat familiar named Gii.
*The video game series ''[[Boktai]]'' revolves around the Vampire Hunter Django. However, even though the games sometimes equalize the terms of ''Vampire'' and ''Immortal'', there are only a few true vampires in the games, such as the Count of Groundsoaking Blood.
* Several ''[[Buffy video games|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' video games have been released.

[[File:Burne-Jones-le-Vampire.jpg|right|thumb|''The Vampire'', by [[Philip Burne-Jones]].]]
'The Vampire' (1897) by [[Philip Burne-Jones]] depicts an alluring female vampire crouched over a male victim. The model was the famous actress [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]]. This [[femme fatale]] inspired a poem of the same name (also 1897) by [[Rudyard Kipling]]. Like much of Kipling's verse it was incredibly popular, and its inspired many early silent films whose 'vampires' were actually '[[Femme fatale#20th century film and theatre|vamps]]' rather than being supernatural undead blood-suckers. The poem's refrain: ''A fool there was . . . '', describing a seduced man, became the title of the popular film ''[[A Fool There Was (1915 film)|A Fool There Was]]'' (1915) which made [[Theda Bara]] a star, and the archetypal cinematic 'vamp'.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Skal "Fatal Image: The Artist, the Actress and "The Vampire" in David J. Skal (ed) (2001) ''Vampires: Encounters With The Undead'': 223-257&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==

Alucard is no mere vampire; it has been implied that he is the most powerful vampire alive and may be the most powerful character in the series.
* "[[Dark Shadows]]" (1966–1971) an early TV series featuring vampire Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid), followed up by a short lived series remake "[[Dark Shadows (1991 TV series)]] this time starring Ben Cross in the title role of the vampire; and a Johnny Depp inspired comedy "[[Darks Shadows (film)]]" remake in (2012). All of these presentations of vampires cared over the mystic of vampires still wearing black capes as popularized in early vampire films (which undoubtable attempts to mimic vampire bat wings).

This creature makes its way aboard their spaceship the Enterprise and kills several.  The creature, killing people, is but pseudo vampiric in type as it looks nothing like a vampire, but draws others life force from them by sucking all the salt from their beings. This well known series starred William Shatner as (Captain James T. Kirk) and Leonard Nimoy as (Mr. Spock) and then there are the other characters, the Doctor Bones (Deforest Kelly), the Engineer Scotty (James Doohan), the Nurse Chapel (Majel Barrett), Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), and Sulu (George Takei).
* "[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]"  This is a (1972–1975) series in which Kolchak discovers an overlooked victim from a crime scene, now turned vampire has made her way from Las Vegas to LA in episode #4, called "The Vampire" (1974) which is a sequel of the first of the two TV movies, the series being inspired as such from "[[The Night Stalker (1972 film)|The Night Stalker]]" movie which also had vampires (a TV movie made in 1972 and also starring Darren McGavin). See [[List of Kolchak: The Night Stalker episodes]].  [Darren McGavin is well known and remembered by many for his starring role as the father in the Christmas movie called "A Christmas Story" (1983)].  There was a very short lived remake of this series simply called "Night Stalker" (2005) starring Stuart Townsend rather as Carl Kolchak and co-starring Gabrielle Union, all the while McGavin was still alive and in which he himself was CGI'd from the original series as a cameo into this remake in one episode.
* "The Curse Of Dracula" (1979–). Count Dracula is alive and well and teaching college in 1979. The series's Director: Jeffrey Hayden, Richard Milton.  Lasted one season in length. And this series featured stars were: Michael Nouri (as Dracula), Stephen Johnson, Carol Baxter, Antoinette Stella.  I believe this was the series that featured flash-back memories of Count Dracula, the vampire using sepia-tone to emphasis it was a different era of time.  (Michael Nouri later would star in the popular film of its era "Flashdance" in 1983; and later also in the 1987 Sci-fi movie "The Hidden").

Nicholas 'Nick' Knight (Geraint Wyn Davies) who works at night and is also on the police force as their detective.

* "[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]" (1997) inspired from the movie of the same title, while this series starred Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy. The vampires in this series are presented as strong but fundamentally 'fragile' walking corpses, vulnerable to sunlight, decapitation, and stakes through the heart, and are clearly established as being demons possessing human corpses rather than humans corrupted by their vampire instincts. The character of Angel- played by David Boreanaz- is an exception to this rule as he was cursed with his soul over a century ago, restoring his capacity for compassion and grief, driving him to seek redemption for his sins in the spin-off series "Angel".
* "Earth: Final Conflict" (1997-2002) In the fifth and final season of this series there is a departure from the current story line of the show than that of all the earlier  seasons, and replacing the Taelons with the newly born and more aggressive alien race who are energy vampires called the Atavus. (Not your traditional vampires as one would think of traditional vampires from the lore; but vampiric in type, thus as such, some would not consider or think of these beings as vampires).
* "[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]" (1999) not to be confused with another Sci-fi TV series called "Dark Angel" (with Jessica Alba). While this series starred David Boreanaz, and was a spinoff of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."  Unlike most vampires in the Whedonverse, Angel was cursed with a soul. If he is ever to experience a moment of perfect happiness, he will lose the soul and become Angelus, the ruthless and bloodthirsty vampire who he was in the past. Angel seeks redemption for his crimes by helping others who have supernatural problems.

* "[[Blood Ties (TV series)|Blood Ties]]" (2006–2008) based on the "Blood Books" by Tanya Huff.  This series was a supernatural drama that revolves around Vicki Nelson (Christina Cox) a former homicide cop now a private investigator and one Henry Fitzroy (Kyle Schmid) a 470-year-old vampire. Together they form a team which solving cases and dealing with the supernatural world.  Similar to the TV series "Angel."
* "[[Moonlight (TV series)]]" (2007–2008) starred Alex O'Loughlin whose character (Mick St. John) a vampire whose love interest is a mortal woman played be actress Beth Turner who plays (Sophia Myles); a TV series very similar in many ways to the TV series "Forever Knight."
* "[[Blade: The Series]]" (2008) inspired by "Blade" saga of films minus Wesley Snipes as the led role.  Like the movie Blade is only half vampire, (long story) so he can effortlessly walk in the day light and is not called a vampire as he actually slays them, and is called a "Daywalker" since sunlight doesn't bother him in the least as previously stated!
* [[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]] (2008-2013) a British series about a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost sharing a flat in Bristol. While a lot of vampires give into their nature, drinking blood and killing people without remorse other vampires in the series are feeling guilty. These vampires try to give up the blood drinking, which is for them like an addiction. However their true nature usually comes through some point.
* "[[True Blood]]" (2008-2014) a cable TV series included excessive nudity, as well as a host of other supernatural beings in the plot story line.  The opening episode begins with Granny Stackhouse, Charles Stackhouse and his sister a telepathic waitress Sookie Stackhouse (half fairy) encountering a mysterious Southern Louisiana gentleman and vampire named Bill Compton at Sam Merlot's bar and grill where Sookie works.  (This series continues the folklore vampires can not walk in the daylight).
* "[[The Vampire Diaries]]" (2009-) plot eventually has two brothers biding over the hand of a mortal girl who looks like a vampire girl they knew generations ago.  Perhaps borrowing or shall I say possibly inspired in a small way with respect to romance from the "Twilight" films.  The vampires have 'daylight rings' made by witches that allow for them to walk in the day light.
* In the popular (2010) cartoon TV show ''[[Adventure Time]]'' one of the main reoccurring characters is [[Marceline the Vampire Queen]].
* [[Being Human (North American TV series)|Being Human]] (2011–2014) a higher calibre American remake series of an English Sci-Fi TV series which included Vampires for which the series focused upon, and again wolves and in this series also disembodied spirits, and witches too.  Like many plots this one too has a romance with the led vampire and once moral girl Sally (that's not the complete story though).  This series shares similarities with the "Highlander" TV series whereas Aidan Waite (Sam Witer) who is the lead Vampire in "Being Human" also has memory flashbacks not unlike that of Duncan McCloud in "Highlander."  Also starring in this series is Sally Malik (Meaghan Rath), their friend Josh Levison (Sam Huntington), and Josh's girlfriend as well as their friend Nora Sergeant (Kristen Hager), Kenny (Conner Price), and Bishop who is Aidan's maker (Mark Pellegrino), among many others.

* "[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]" (2013-) a spinoff of "The Vampire Dairies" TV series.  This series deals with a family who first became vampires, and while their abilities were much more played up in "The Vampire Dairies" TV series their abilities don't seem to be as novel as they did, or extra ordinary as they did in the previous TV series.  In this series there is often a brooding faction between witches of the court of New Orleans and the vampires; as well as some shape shifter wolves (to make a long story short).
* "[[Dracula (TV series)|Dracula]]" (2013–2014) starred Jonathan Rhys Meyers (is Dracula incognito as Alexander Grayson/Vlad Tepes), Jessica De Gouw, Thomas Kretschmann (a young dubious Abraham Van Helsing), Jonathan Harker (would be Fiancé to Mina), Katie McGarath (Mina's BFF and unbeknowns to her bi-curious about her, played by Lucy Westenra), and finally Nonso Anozle long time friend and bodyguard of Dracula (R.M. Renfield).  The mystic of Count Dracula as a wealthy and seductive force to be reckoned with is outline and further embellished is this drama telling the story of his character and genius with his being both an entrepreneur and an inventor, a Tesla of his times!  Also this drama's sub theme deals with his obsession with being able to permanently walk in sunlight; while seeking a romantic liaison with a girl by the name of Mina Murray (Jessica De Gouw) that appears to be a doppelganger or unknowns to her a reincarnation of his past lover.  He carries out his business transactions all the while hiding from a secret society cult that has sought to destroy all vampires for centuries who are played by a cast of characters, and namely by one Lady Jayne Wetherby (Victoria Smurfit). [R.M. Renfield can at this time contemporarily be seen starring in the movie "Ender's Game" (2013)].

This episode uses a figure taken from Filipino folklore. The Aswang, a creature (someone with an evil side let loose) typically something like a cross between a vampire and a werewolf, a humanoid shape-shifter that feeds on unborn infants of pregnant women.  As such this creature has a long serpent like tongue as also featured although differently in the TV series "The Strain."  This creature is witnessed by Sgt. Wu (Reggie Lee) who has never to this point seen such, though only usually seen by Nick and his team; while this creature featured in this episode of "Grimm" can be said to be but pseudo vampiric in type.  [Bitsie Tulloch plays Nick's wife (Juliette Silverton), and Russell Hornsby plays Nick's partner (Hank Griffin) also a police officer who knows Nick's supernatural abilities].
* ''[[American Horror Story: Hotel]]'' (2015-2016), the fifth season of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] anthology series ''[[American Horror Story]]''. The season focuses on the fictional Hotel Cortez and its inhabitants, vampire-like creatures that are immortal, feed on blood and are adverse to sunlight. [[Lady Gaga]] plays Countess Elizabeth Johnson, the owner of the titular Hotel. Elizabeth's brood of children, including Holden Lowe (Lennon Henry), are all infected with the blood virus, as is her lover Donovan ([[Matt Bomer]]) and arch-nemesis Ramona Royale ([[Angela Bassett]]).

===[[Strix (mythology)|Strix]]===
The ''[[Stirge]]'' was presented as a popular monster in [[Dungeons and Dragons]]. In the game it took the form of a many-legged flying creature which sucked the blood from its victims through a sharp, tubular beak.

A version of the striga makes an appearance in ''[[The Witcher (video game)]]'' based on the works of Polish writer [[Andrzej Sapkowski]]. As a demonic undead creature, which transforms from the corpse of a dead child conceived via incest, striga in the Witcher's universe doesn't look like insects or vampires but looks similar to a ghoul with a muscular quadrupedal body, big claws, and a fang-filled mouth.

The strix make an appearance in the ''[[Vampire: the Requiem]]'' historical book ''Requiem for Rome''. In contrast to the more traditional vampires presented in the line, the strix are disembodied spirits who commonly take the shape of owls and can possess both humans and torpored vampires. It is rumored that the strix restored [[Remus]] to undeath, and corrupted a sixth clan of vampires who were destroyed en masse. The strix believed themselves to be betrayed by the vampires of Rome, especially those of the Julii clan, and swore to bring about their ruin. They reappear in ''Night Horrors: Wicked Dead'' as heralds of disaster, mainly unbound by their former oath (although they still occasionally pursue such activities for personal reasons). Immensely amoral [[libertinism|libertines]], they view vampires clinging to humanity as weak, and as such will often serve as tempters in order to make them lose themselves to the Beast.

Strix are also described in the GURPS third edition Sourcebook for Vampires ''Blood Types''. They are described as witches who, having made pacts with dark entities gained the ability to become blood drinking birds at night. What their pacts with these dark forces require of them is not described.

===[[Wurdulac]]===
*[[Mario Bava]] made a 1963 [[anthology film]] of it starring [[Boris Karloff]] called ''[[Black Sabbath (film)|Black Sabbath]]''.
* A wurdulac is also the subject of ''[[Monster in My Pocket]]'' #116.
* In 1972 the Italian/Spanish film called La notte dei diavoli (Night of the Devils) was also based on Tolstoy's story.

'''''Walking Brooklyn: 30 Tours Exploring Historical Legacies, Neighborhood Culture, Side Streets, and Waterways''''' is a book by Adrienne Onofri. It was published in June 2007 by [[Wilderness Press]] as one of the first titles in their urban trekking series.

''Walking Brooklyn'' consists of 30 chapters, each providing a [[walking tour]] of a [[Brooklyn]] area. As described by the ''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'': "Each walk begins with a map of the area with the appropriate route highlighted, a summary of boundaries, approximate distance of the route and the closest subway stop to begin at, followed by a brief historical introduction to the area. The actual street-by-street (sometimes step-by-step) route guide is then provided in bullet form. The walks are each concluded with a summary of the points of interests described as well as a MapQuest-like route summary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=July 19, 2007|first=Kathy|last=Wang|title=Brooklyn Bridge to Brighton Beach: All in a Day’s Walk|url=http://brooklyneagle.com/categories/category.php?category_id=27&amp;id=14190|work=[[Brooklyn Eagle|Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]|accessdate=May 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
