 The word "Amil" has its origin in the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''"amal"'' (as "administer").&lt;ref name="Anita Raina Thapan
"&gt;{{cite book|last=Raina Thapan |first =Anita|title=Sindhi Diaspora in Manila, Hong Kong, and Jakarta|publisher=Ateneo de Manila U Press|pages=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMHPhLZiI8cC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=amil,+lohana&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sindh]] this clan ranks first in the hierarchical ranking among followed by [[Bhaiband]].&lt;ref name="Claude Markovits"&gt;{{cite book|last= Markovits|first = Claude|title=The Global World of Indian Merchants, 1750-1947: Traders of Sind from ...|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2vu7Odjz6kC&amp;pg=PA47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Amils held the highest administrative offices under [[Muslim]] rulers, beginning in the mid-eighteenth century. They speak [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]].&lt;ref name="Shabnum Tejani"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tejani|first =Shabnum |title=Indian Secularism: A Social and Intellectual History, 1890-1950|publisher=Indiana University Press|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xtrPKa59j4C&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=amil,+lohana&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amils consist principally of bankers, clerks, businesspersons and lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Indian year book, Volume 25|year=1938

During the [[British Raj|British Rule]], Amils and Bhaibands spoke fluent English, as compared to the Thatis and Sahitis, who being traders and shopkeepers, could not. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}} They were, along with the Parsis, the closest to the British and were regularly sent to Britain in order to seal business deals on behalf of the [[East India Company]].  Amils are the wealthiest in the Sindhi community and are highly educated, even to this day. They pray mostly to [[Guru Nanak]] and very rarely to [[Jhulelal (Hinduism)|Jhulelal]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Amils can be distinguished by their exceptionally long surnames (most of the time).

'''Banat Bulgarian''' (Banat Bulgarian: ''Palćena balgarsćija jázić'' or ''Banátsća balgarsćija jázić''; {{lang-bg|банатски български език}}, {{lang|bg-Latn|Banatski balgarski ezik}}; {{lang-de|Banater Bulgarische Sprache}}; {{lang-hu|Bánsági bolgár nyelv}}; {{lang-ro|Limba bulgarilor bănăţeni}}; {{lang-sr|Banatski bugarski jezik}}) is the outermost dialect of the [[Bulgarian language]] with standardized writing and an old literary tradition. It is spoken by the [[Banat Bulgarians]] in the [[Banat]] region, in [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]]. Officially, it is spoken by 8,000 people (1,658 in Serbia, and 6,500 in Romania), though other estimates give numbers up to 15,000.

In 1998, [[Jáni Vasilčin]] from [[Dudeştii Vechi]] translated the [[New Testament]] into Banat Bulgarian: ''Svetotu Pismu Novija Zákun.'' In 2017 published [[Ána Marijka Bodor]] an Banat Bulgarian translation&lt;ref&gt;[https://miselj.blogspot.com/2018/03/cdlvii-manenija-princ.html?m=1 CDLVII. MANENIJA PRINC – Preubarnata ud Ána Marijka BODOR, rudéna KÁLÁPIŠ (miselj.blogspot.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s ''[[The Little Prince]]''.

== Origins ==
{{further|Banat Bulgarians}}
The Banat Bulgarians are predominantly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] people. Their ancestors arrived in the region centuries ago from Northern Bulgaria. They settled in [[Oltenia]] under the [[Wallachia]]n prince, then when Oltenia fell to the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]], they fled to [[Hungary]]. The ancestor of the Banat Bulgarian language is the [[Paulician dialect]], member of the [[Rup dialects|Rup dialect]] group.

== History ==


In the 1740s, [[Blasius Hristofor]] instituted the first school in Dudeştii Vechi in which Banat Bulgarian was taught using the [[Latin script]]. Some Bulgarian priests of the time already used the Latin alphabet, banned by the bishops. In the 19th century, the group's national consciousness strengthened and more Banat books were written. 

In the 19th century, Banat Bulgarian schools used the [[Illyrian movement|Illyrian-Slavic language]]. In the course of using Illyrian-Slavic, the more [[Slovene language|Slovenisms]] entered the language.

The [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[Imre Berecz]] and the Croatian [[András Klobucsár]] wrote a few books in their mother tongue. Berecz wrote a catechism in Banat Bulgarian (1851). Klobucsár designed a prayer- and hymn-book. One of the teachers, [[János Uzun]], also wrote secular verses. In 1866, [[József Rill]] standardised the Banat Bulgarian language and published ''Balgarsku právupisanj (Bulgarian Orthography).'' 

The Balgarsku právupisanj was used to design coursebooks in Banat Bulgarian, including an ABC book and reader, together with ''Biblijata''  and ''Gulemija Kátaæizmus.'' Teacher [[Leopold Koszilkov]] was also translating Gospels. [[Fránc Glász]] and the [[Germans|German]] [[Ludovik Fischer]] wrote a prayer-book. This were notable works notables in Banat Bulgarian literature, as were very popular. The prayerbooks contain prayers, hymns and the biographies of saints. Koszilkov published calendars.

Banat Bulgarians retained their language. [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] were used in schools, but in the catechisms henceforward Banat Bulgarian was used.

== Linguistic features ==
The vernacular of the Bulgarians of Banat can be classified as a [[Paulician dialect]] of the Eastern Bulgarian group. A typical feature is the "ы" (*y) vowel, which can either take an etymological place or replace "i".&lt;ref name=ivanova&gt;Иванова, ''Говорът и книжовноезиковата практика на българите-католици от сръбски Банат''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other characteristic phonological features are the "ê" (wide "e") reflex of the [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[yat]] and the reduction of "o" into "u" and sometimes "e" into "i": ''puljé'' instead of ''pole'' ("field"), ''sélu'' instead of ''selo'' ("village"), ''ugništi'' instead of ''ognište'' ("fireplace").&lt;ref name=ivanova/&gt; Another feature is the [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of final consonants, which is typical for other [[Slavic languages]] but found only in some nonstandard dialects in Bulgarian (in such dialects the word ''den'' ("day") sounds like ''denj'')&lt;ref name=stoykov&gt;Стойков, ''Банатски говор''.&lt;/ref&gt; and not in standard Bulgarian.

Lexically, the language has borrowed many words from languages such as [[German language|German]] (''drot'' from ''Draht'', "wire"; ''gáng'' from ''Gang'', "anteroom, corridor"), Hungarian (''vilánj'' from ''villany'', "electricity"; ''mozi'', "cinema"), Serbian (''stvár'' from ''stvar'', "item, matter"; ''ráčun'' from ''račun'', "account"), and Romanian (''šedinca'' from ''şedinţă'', "conference")&lt;ref&gt;Etymology from Gaberoff Koral German Dictionary (German), [http://dict.sztaki.hu/english-hungarian MTA SZTAKI] (Hungarian), [http://www.krstarica.com/dictionary Serbian-English Dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006220820/http://www.krstarica.com/dictionary/ |date=2009-10-06 }} (Serbo-Croatian) and [http://www.dictionare.com/english/dictionary.htm Dictionare.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028033725/http://www.dictionare.com/english/dictionary.htm |date=2010-10-28 }} (Romanian).&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2016|reason=What these refs demonstrate is that the source languages have the word in question. We need refs for the statement that the Banat Bulgarian words were borrowed from these precise languages.}} due to the close contacts with the other peoples of the multiethnic Banat and the religious ties with other Roman Catholic peoples. Banat Bulgarian also has some older loanwords from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]&lt;ref name=nyagulov-p27&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Greek language|Greek]], which it shares with other Bulgarian dialects (e.g. ''hirgjén'' from Turkish ''ergen'', "unmarried man, bachelor"; ''trandáfer'' from Greek τριαντάφυλλο ''triantafyllo'', "rose").&lt;ref&gt;See ''Sveta ud pukraj námu'' posts [http://starbisnov.blogspot.com/2007/03/127.html #127] and [http://starbisnov.blogspot.com/2007/03/128.html #128] for the words in use. Etymology from [http://www.seslisozluk.com Seslisozluk.com] (Turkish) and [http://www.kypros.org/cgi-bin/lexicon Kypros.org Lexicon] (Greek).&lt;/ref&gt; Loanwords constitute around 20% of the Banat Bulgarian vocabulary.&lt;ref name=stoykov/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyagulov-p27/&gt; The names of some Banat Bulgarians are also influenced by Hungarian names, as the [[Hungarian name|Hungarian (eastern) name order]] is sometimes used ([[family name]] followed by [[given name]]) and the female ending "-a" is often dropped from family names. Thus, ''Marija Velčova'' would become ''Velčov Marija''.&lt;ref&gt;For another example, see ''[http://nasaglas.link.ro/2007/NG200705.pdf Náša glás] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225173131/http://nasaglas.link.ro/2007/NG200705.pdf |date=2009-02-25 }}'' of 1 March 2007, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to loanwords, the lexicon of Banat Bulgarian has also acquired [[calque]]s and [[neologism]]s, such as ''svetica'' ("icon", formerly used ''ikona'' and influenced by German ''Heiligenbild''), ''zarno'' ("bullet", from the word meaning "grain"), ''oganbalváč'' ("volcano", literally "fire belcher"), and ''predhurta'' ("foreword").&lt;ref name=stoykov/&gt;

The Banat Bulgarian language has its own alphabet largely based on the Croatian alphabet ([[Gaj's Latin Alphabet]]) and preserves many features that are archaic in the language spoken in Bulgaria.  Banat Bulgarian was codified as early as 1866 and is used in literature and the media, which distinguishes it from other Bulgarian dialects.&lt;ref name=stoykov/&gt;

=== Alphabet ===
The following is the Banat Bulgarian Latin alphabet:&lt;ref&gt;Нягулов, ''Банатските българи'',  p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Банатският говор |last=Стойков |first=Стойко |language=Bulgarian |pages=21–23 |year=1967 |publisher=Издателство на БАН |oclc=71461721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bantu Kavirondo''' is the former name given to some of the [[Bantu peoples]] of western [[Kenya]] (e.g., the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] and [[Kisii people|Kisii]]) under the early colonial regime of [[British East Africa]]. [[Winam Gulf|Kavirondo Gulf]] (Winam Gulf) and the surrounding area of "Kavirondo" derive from the same name. They were designated “Bantu" Kavirondo in contradistinction to the “[[Nilotic Kavirondo]]” ([[Luo (Kenya)|Luo]]).

The term should no longer be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11644">{{Basque culture}}
Although the first instances of coherent [[Basque language|Basque]] phrases and sentences go as far back as the [[Glosas Emilianenses|San Millán glosses]] of around 950, the large-scale damage done by periods of great instability and warfare, such as the clan wars of the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Carlist Wars]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]], led to the scarcity of written material predating the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;Trask, L. ''The History of Basque'' Routledge 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving traces of Basque literary activity go back to the 16th century, but significant production does not seem to have set in until the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; Since the end of the [[Spain under Franco|Francoist period]] in Spain, the formation of a [[standard Basque|standard language]], and the large scale introduction of Basque into the education system consequently increased literary activity. While much of the literature written in Basque remains targeted at the native audience, some works by Basque authors have been translated into other languages, such as [[Bernardo Atxaga]], and achieved global recognition.

==The 16th century==
[[Image:Lingue vasconum primitiae.gif|thumb|150px|The title page of the ''Linguæ Vasconum Primitiæ'']]
A few songs from the 16th century have survived, such as the ''Song of the Battle of [[Beotibar]]'' that deals with the battle fought in 1321 and a group of verses known as ''The Burning of [[Mondragón]]'' from the time of the [[War of the Bands|Basque Clan Wars]].&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

The earliest piece of [[prose]] written in Basque is a letter composed in 1537 by the Biscayan [[Juan de Zumárraga]] from Durango, the first [[bishop]] of [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=EH&gt;Inxausti, J. ''Euskal Herria - The Country of the Basque Language'' [[Basque Government]] 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a few years later in 1545, the first book known to have been put into print is published - a collection of poems fashioned by [[Bernard Etxepare]], a priest from [[Lower Navarre]] in the [[Northern Basque Country]], by the title ''Linguæ Vasconum Primitiæ'' ("Beginnings of the Basque Language"). In this book, Etxepare expresses his hopes that the first publication of a book in Basque will serve to invigorate the language and culture. His efforts were undoubtedly influenced by wider movements in Europe at the time that encouraged literary production in [[vernacular]] languages&lt;ref name=EH/&gt; rather than [[Latin]].
[[Image:Joan Perez de Lazarraga 1564 67.jpg|thumb|150px|A page in Lazarraga's own handwriting]]
The next publication is a recently discovered pastoral play by [[Joan Perez de Lazarraga]] (1548?—1605) by the name of ''Silbero, Silbia, Doristeo and Sirena'' produced between 1564 and 1567 in [[Larrea]], [[Alava]], making it the earliest surviving play in Basque. With 102 pages (some damaged) it is also the longest early text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gipuzkoakultura.net/lazarraga/ Lazarraga] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209033706/http://www.gipuzkoakultura.net/lazarraga/ |date=2008-12-09 }} Gipuzkoako Arkibo Orokorra. Retrieved 22 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

1571 saw the publication of [[Joanes Leizarraga]]'s [[New Testament]] translation into a standardised form of his [[Lapurdian]] dialect, promoted by [[Jeanne d'Albret]], Queen of Navarre. He also wrote a small number of other religious works.

The closing years of the 16th century see another publication, this time from the South, of a collection of proverbs written in the [[Biscayan]] dialect called ''Refranes y sentencias'' by an unknown author. However, by this time, the centre of Basque literary production had firmly established itself to the north of the Pyrenees, in [[Lower Navarre]] and the French provinces of [[Labourd]] and [[Soule]], where it would remain for several centuries.

Although dialectal differences are clearly visible in these early texts, it is also clear that the differences in the 16th century were considerably smaller than they are today.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

==The 17th century==
In amongst the trickle of smaller religious works the [[Counter Reformation]] movement, which in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] had its centre in [[Sare]], [[Soule]], produced one of the most notable works of the 17th century,&lt;ref name=EH/&gt; This was a religious publication, called ''[[Gero (book)|Gero]]'', the preachings of [[Pedro Agerre]] (better known as ''Axular'') but in literary form, published in 1643. Although he was born in [[Urdax]] in [[Navarre]] and working in Soule, he wrote in Lapurdian,&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; which by then had established itself as the most prestigious form of Basque.

Other important works of this century were:

* ''Dotrina christiana'' by [[Estève Materre]] in 1617, also one of the earliest known learners of Basque&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;
* The works of [[Silvain Pouvreau]], one of the earliest known learners of Basque.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; His works (some of which were published posthumously) include  ''Giristinoaren Dotrina'' (Paris, 1656); ''Filotea'' (Paris, 1664); ''Gudu espirituala'' (Paris, 1665), ''Andre Dana Maria Privilegiatua'' (J. Vinson: 1892), ''Iesusen Imitacionea'' (1978, Hordago) and an unpublished but important dictionary.
* [[Arnauld de Oihenart]], born 1592 in [[Mauléon-Licharre|Mauléon]], who was the first Basque  [[layman]] to write in the language and who produced a large amount of poetry and an important collection of proverbs, the first of which was published in 1657 in [[Paris]]. His style of writing is still regarded as one of the highest in the history of Basque literature&lt;ref name =Trask/&gt;
* ''Liburuhauda Ixasoco nabigacionecoa'', a book on marine navigation written by [[Martin de Hoyarzabal]] and translated by [[Piarres Detcheverry]] in 1677
* A book on farming techniques by [[Mongongo Dessança]] in 1692

Although [[Gipuzkoan]] and [[Biscayan]] enjoyed some status as literary dialects, Lapurdian was by far the most commonly used dialect of the 17th century.

==The 20th Century==
[[File:Joxean Artzeren hiletan.jpg|thumb|Poet J. Artze's poem projected on the wall of Usurbil's church (2018)]]
Some referential figures of 20th century Basque literature are [[Telesforo Monzon]], [[Salbatore Mitxelena]], [[Gabriel Aresti]], [[Nikolas Ormaetxea]], [[Txillardegi]] (pen name of José Luis Álvarez Enparantza), [[Joxe Azurmendi]], [[Ramon Saizarbitoria]], [[Bernardo Atxaga]], or [[Joseba Sarrionandia]]. In addition, there are many Basque writers who have written in Spanish: [[Blas de Otero]], and [[Gabriel Celaya]].

In the 20th century, the [[Spanish Civil War]] halted all Basque cultural and literary production for almost two decades. The most affected domain was that of language and the creation of texts in Basque. The bulk of Basque writers died or escaped to exile, where they undertook some attempts to revitalize literature by writing books or launching magazines of limited circulation.

However, some works were not even published during that period. In the [[Southern Basque Country]], during the 1950s new generations undertook efforts to write a new type of literature along European lines, innovating both in content and form, despite being heavily conditioned by [[National-Catholicism|Francoist]] censorship.

==Characteristics==
The most typical traits of Basque literature during history have gradually shifted up to the present time. A number of consistent characteristics have been pinpointed, like the emphasis on folk, ethnological and mythological elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ur|first1=Apalategi|title=THE NOVELISTIC EVOLUTION OF THE BASQUE SUBJECT: LITERARY-IDEOLOGICAL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE DESIRE FOR DIFFERENTIATION AND THE SEARCH FOR RECOGNITION|url=http://www.452f.com/pdf/numero09/09_452f-mono-ur-apalategi-en.pdf}}, p. {{specify}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Kortazar underscores the "uncertainty between the epic sense and playfulness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kortazar|first1=Jon|title=Diglosia y literatura vasca|date=2007|publisher=Olivar|pages=71–104{{specify}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing==
Between 1545 and 1974, 4,000 books were published in the Basque language, whereas between 1974 and 1995 12,500 were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kurlansky|2000|p=326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Basque publishing began with the establishment of Elkar in 1972, a small publishing company based in [[Bayonne]] in the French Basque country.&lt;ref name= k327&gt;{{harvnb|Kurlansky|2000|p=327}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], Elkar established a second publishing operation in [[San Sebastián]] in the Spanish Basque country.&lt;ref name= k327/&gt; Although a number of other Basque publishing houses have been subsequently established, Elkar remains the largest.&lt;ref name= k327/&gt;

The '''Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences''', abbreviated '''BITSS''', is an academic initiative dedicated to advancing [[transparency]] and openness in [[social science]] research. It was established in 2012 by the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Center for Effective Global Action]]. It is led by an interdisciplinary group of academics from ten different universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bitss.org/about/ |title=About |date=2015-10-08 |website=Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has worked with the [[Center for Open Science]] to define and promote a set of best practices for social scientists to maximize transparency in their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Miguel |first=E. |last2=Camerer |first2=C. |last3=Casey |first3=K. |last4=Cohen |first4=J. |last5=Esterling |first5=K.

'''Bey al-Mahalla''' ({{lang-ar|بيه المحلّة}}) meaning ''Bey of the Camp'', was a title for the [[heir apparent]] to throne of the [[Tunisia|Beylik of Tunis]]. The title was given to the most senior member of the Beylical family after the reigning [[Bey of Tunis|Bey]]. The title came the style of [[Highness]]. The last person to carry this title was [[Husain Bey, Crown Prince of Tunisia|Prince Husain Bey, Bey al-Mahalla]], heir apparent to Tunisia from 1955 until the abolition of the monarchy in 1957. From Tunisia's independence on March 20, 1956 he was given the new title of Crown Prince.

=== Business executives ===
[[Ricardo Fernández Barrueco]] was a "modest business entrepreneur" in Caracas until he helped Chávez circumvent [[Venezuelan general strike of 2002-03|oil strikes]] initiated in 2002. In less than ten years, he had gained a net worth of $1.6 billion and created a combination of about 70 companies. He owned businesses in Panama, Ecuador and the United States and bought multiple financial institutions in 2008. In Miami, Fernandez bought a luxury apartment in the [[Jade at Brickell Bay]], a home to many celebrities. In late 2009, Fernandez was arrested in Venezuela for unknown reasons and his companies were nationalized by President Chávez. He was released from prison in May 2014.&lt;ref name=UNIaug2013/&gt;

[[Víctor Vargas Irausquín]] is a Venezuelan banker who helped the Chávez administration raise funds to finance Venezuela's budget. According to the United States Department of State, Vargas was "said to have made a profit off those negotiations" and was described as "a banker whose star has risen greatly during the Chávez presidency". Vargas was also assisted by the Venezuelan government for abiding by their policies during the [[Venezuelan banking crisis of 2009–10|Venezuelan banking crisis of 2009–2010]], when more than a half-dozen private banking institutions were closed.&lt;ref name=UNIaug2013/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2143">'''Broichan''' is the name of a wizard who lived in 6th century [[Pictland]] and served [[King Bridei I]]. [[Adomnan of Iona]] wrote about him and his relation to [[St Columba]] during the saint's travels in Pictland.

The wizard is mentioned by Adomnan as being close to the king and that he also possessed an Irish slave-girl who had possibly been a war captive. In Adomnan's account, when Columba met Broichan and Bridei at the king's fortress near the [[river ness]], Columba demanded that the girl be released but the wizard refused. Columba then went down to the river and told his companions that an angel at that moment had struck Broichan, and his cup had fallen from his hand and he was deathly ill. Moments later two messengers from King Bridei came to inform Columba of these events as they happened, and Columba gave his own messengers a pebble from the River Ness and told them that if Broichan agreed to release the slave-girl, then they were instructed to place the pebble in a cup of water and make him drink it, but if Broichan refused, then he would die immediately. They then went back to the fortress and Broichan agreed to release the girl, and so they placed the pebble in a cup of water, and it miraculously floated on top. Broichan drank from it and was healed. The pebble was then kept at the fortress and used whenever someone needed healing for a disease, but it could not be found when the time for someone to die had really come, and so on the day when King Bridei was about to die, they couldn't find the pebble anywhere.

Adomnan also recorded a story about Broichan in the same vicinity of Pictland. In the second story, Columba and his companions were getting into a boat on [[Loch Ness]] and preparing to leave, but Broichan used his magic to summon the weather against Columba and so the winds went against him. Columba then called on Christ's name and ordered the sails to be raised, and miraculously the boat then went off at a high speed directly into the oncoming wind that was blowing against them.

The '''Ch'orti' people''' (alternatively, ''Ch'orti' Maya'' or ''Chorti'') are one of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Maya peoples]], who primarily reside in communities and towns of southeastern [[Guatemala]], northwestern [[Honduras]], and northern [[El Salvador]]. Their [[Mesoamerican languages|indigenous language]], also known as [[Ch'orti' language|Ch'orti']], is a survival of Classic Choltian, the language of the inscriptions in [[Copan]]. It is the first language of approximately 15,000 people, although the majority of present-day Ch'orti' speakers are [[bilingualism|bilingual]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as well.

== History ==
[[File:Brenda Suyapa Pineda02.JPG|thumb|Brenda Suyapa Pineda representing the Chortis of Honduras at the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras]].]]
The Ch'orti' area, which had [[Copán]] as its cultural center, was the headquarters of the ancient [[Mayan civilization]].  The Ch'orti' people, led by the Mayan chief {{ILL|Copán Galel|es}}, strongly but unsuccessfully resisted the [[Spanish conquerors]].

The Ch'orti' belong to the Meridional Mayans, and are closely related to the Mayans in [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]], [[Belize]] and Northern [[Guatemala]].  They are also somewhat related to the [[Choles]], Mayans who currently live in [[Chiapas]].

Historically, the Ch'orti Mayans were located in the [[Ocotepeque Department|Ocotepeque]] and [[Copán Department|Copan]] departments, as well as in the northern strip of the [[Cortés Department|Cortes]] and [[Santa Bárbara Department, Honduras|Santa Barbara]] departments.  This geographical area possibly also extended to [[El Salvador]] on the south, to [[Chiquimula]] on the west, and to the [[Lago de Izabal|Golfo Dulce]] to the north.  Currently, the majority of the Ch'orti are located in [[Guatemala]] (in [[Chiquimula]], [[Jocotan]], [[Esquipulas]], [[Quezaltenango]] and [[La Union, Zacapa|La Union]]).

The current Guatemalan Ch'orti' population estimate is 46,833.

The Ch'orti' population in [[Honduras]] live in areas of difficult access in the [[Copán Department|Copan]] and [[Ocotepeque Department|Ocotepeque]] departments, like Chonco, Colon Jubuco, San Rafael, Tapescos, Carrizalon, La Laguna, [[Santa Rita, Copán|Santa Rita]], Antigua Ocotepeque, [[Nueva Ocotepeque]], and [[Sensenti]].

The current Honduran Ch'orti' population estimate is 4,200.  They are mostly farmers, and they lived in areas mixed with [[mestizos]].

== Organization and Culture ==

The Ch'ortis in Copan speak [[Spanish Language|Spanish]]; most [[Ch'orti' language|Ch'orti]] speakers are in Guatemala.  This is because the political division between Honduras and Guatemala, and the inherent movement restriction between the two countries.

However, the traditional customs of dress have been kept, as well as musical traditions, expressed using instruments like teponangas, drums, whistles, chinchins, sonajas and horns.  The most traditional dance is called the "dance of the giants".

Their food is based mainly on corn and beans.  Corn is prepared in different ways: as a drink, like chilate, pozol, sweet atole, and sour atole (chuco), tortillas, tamales, totoposte and also alcoholic drinks like chicha.

Ch'ortis religion is based on admiring and adoring nature, through rituals dedicated to the gods of the Earth and the Wind.

{{Chinatown}}

'''Chinatowns in Latin America''' ({{lang-es|barrios chinos}}, singular ''barrio chino'' / {{lang-pt|bairros chineses}}, singular ''bairro chinês'') developed with the rise of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese immigration]] in the 19th century to various countries in [[Latin America]] as contract laborers (i.e., [[indentured servant]]s) in [[agricultural]] and [[fishing]] industries. Most came from [[Guangdong Province]]. Since the 1970s, the new arrivals have typically hailed from [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Taiwan]]. Latin American Chinatowns may include the descendants of original migrants &amp;mdash; often of mixed Chinese and [[Latino]] parentage &amp;mdash; and more recent immigrants from [[East Asia]].  Most [[Asian Latin American]]s are of [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] origin.
Estimates widely vary on the number of Chinese Descendants in Latin America but it is at least 
1.4 million and likely much greater than this.

Unlike the Chinatowns of [[Anglo America]] and [[Europe]], pure-blood ethnic Chinese were relatively few in number but now increasing rapidly due to generally lower levels of Chinese immigration to some parts of Latin America. Residents of Latin American Chinatowns tend to be multilingual. Latin America's Chinatowns include those of [[Mexico City]], [[Havana]], [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Lima, Peru|Lima]]. Some of these Chinatowns mainly serve as tourist attractions and not as true, living ethnic communities. The Chinatown of Havana, Cuba's is largely multi-generation Spanish-speaking Chinese Cuban whereas the Chinatown of the [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] district of Buenos Aires, Argentina consists of many first-generation [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Holo]]- and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking immigrants from Taiwan.

Politically, several nations of Latin America recognize the government of the [[Republic of China]] in Taiwan. A Chinese arch was presented as a gift to the Barrio Chino of Panama City, following the visit of Panama by the then Taiwanese President [[Lee Teng-hui]]. After the major official visit by the Cuban Revolution's [[Fidel Castro]] to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1995, materials were given for the new Chinese arch on Calle Dragone in Havana's Barrio Chino.

==Argentina==
{{see also|Chinese Argentine|Barrio Chino (Buenos Aires)}}
It is centered on Arribeños, Mendoza and Montañeses Streets, in the middle-class neighbourhood of [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires]]. Large numbers of recent [[Taiwan]]ese and [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] immigrants have settled in the area.  Also included are ethnic Chinese from other parts of the Americas and East Asia, and Asians of non-Chinese ancestry, mainly Japanese and Korean, whose first immigrants date from WWII and the Korean war.[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/edicionimpresa/suplementos/inmueblescomerciales/nota.asp?nota_id=681082&amp;origen=ranking]
.

==Brazil==
{{see also|Chinese Brazilians|Liberdade (district of São Paulo)}}
Significant population of Chinese Brazilian live in [[Liberdade (district of São Paulo)|Liberdade]] area in [[São Paulo]]. There are 3 million Chinese immigrants living in Brazil, while 2 million living in São Paulo area, significant population can also be found in capital [[Brasília]]. Many Chinese immigrants settled to São Paulo following the end of [[Chinese civil war]] in 1949. Most of the Chinese are [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]] descent while some of them are descended from [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]

==Cuba==
[[File:Chinatown Gate Havana.jpg|thumb|right|Chinatown Gate in Havana]]
Chinese immigration to [[Cuba]] started in 1847 when Spanish settlers brought in Cantonese contract workers to work in the sugar fields. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers were brought in from [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Taiwan]] during the following decades to replace the labor of African slaves. After completing 8-year contracts, the Chinese immigrants generally settled permanently in Cuba, where their descendants have since intermarried with local Cubans.

Unlike that of Argentina and other [[Latin American]] countries, the overseas Chinese population of [[Cuba]] was once large, but the now-diminished [[Chinese Cuban]] community is today clustered around the largely dying ''Barrio Chino'' &amp;mdash; called ''Barrio Chino de La Habana'' &amp;mdash; on Calle Zanja, in [[Havana]]. After the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959, many Chinese Cuban entrepreneurs fled the country for the [[United States]]. Since the 1960s, Cuba has not attracted very many, if any, Chinese immigrants (developments or redevelopments of Chinatowns tend to require much private investments for which political conditions in Cuba are not favorable).

Only one Chinese-language newspaper, ''Kwong Wah Po'', remains in Cuba. Havana's Chinatown was formerly among the largest in [[Latin America]] as the neighborhood comprised 44 square blocks during its prime. To tie in with the Revolution's economic reliance on tourism, attempts have recently been launched to attract revitalization investment for the Chinatown from [[Mainland Chinese]] state-run enterprises and [[overseas Chinese]] private investors, particularly [[Chinese Canadian]]s.

==Chile==
Between 1,200 and 1,500 [[Chinese Peruvian|Chinese workers in Peru]] offered support to the Chilean side in the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879-1883) and thus went to Chile at the war's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chou|2004|loc=Ch. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Chinese shops, supermarkets, and restaurants located in [[Barrio Patronato]] neighborhood in [[Santiago]]. However, some Chinese businesses can also be found in shopping centers such as Santiago Centro and Estación Central

==Colombia==
The city of [[Cali]] has the largest [[Asian people|Asian]] community because of its proximity to the Pacific Coast. The Chinese population can also be found in [[Barranquilla]] and [[Medellin]]. A small Chinatown exist in capital city [[Bogotá]], especially in [[San Victorino]] area.&lt;ref&gt;https://thecitypaperbogota.com/bogota/clashing-over-contraband-in-bogotas-san-victorino/13105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==

===History===
The first [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese immigrants]] to Mexico came from [[China]], some were [[Philippines|Philippine]]-born Chinese, brought by the [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleon]] trade {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}. However most contemporary Chinese immigrants came to Mexico during the 20th century as contract workers and political refugees. With the rise of anti-Chinese sentiment in Mexico in the 1930s under President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], most Chinese Mexicans, including individuals of mixed Chinese and Mexican descent, were forced out of Mexico and deported to China.

===Mexico City===

[[Mexico City]]'s small ''barrio chino'' is on Calle Dolores in [[Cuauhtémoc, D.F.|Cuauhtémoc borough]] in the city center.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Mexicali, a historic Chinese outpost===
{{Main article|La Chinesca}}
The border city of [[Mexicali]], [[Baja California]], contains the second largest concentration of Chinese Mexicans in [[Mexico]].  The neighborhood is located on Avenida Madero Calle Azueta, is called ''[[Mexicali#Chinatown.2C Mexicali|La Chinesca]]'' (The ''Chinesque'' one). Some of the earliest Chinese settlers who arrived in the [[United States]] eventually went south to Mexico to escape institutionalized anti-Chinese persecution in [[California]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The largest number of new Cantonese-speaking Chinese immigrants came mostly from the [[Guangzhou]] area around 1919. Mexicali had a local chapter of the [[Kuomintang]]. There is now a consulate of the [[People's Republic of China]] in Mexicali as well as one in nearby Tijuana. The economic problems of Mexico in the 1980s led many Chinese-Mexicans to migrate north into the United States. Today, members of the multi-generational Chinese-Mexican community own and operate many businesses across the city. One of the oldest Chinese restaurants, Restaurant 19, is named after one of the early Mexican Chinatown corridors, Alley 19, which opened December 18, 1928, and eventually closed in winter 2001. It was one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Mexico. This restaurant was utilized by many U.S. and Mexican officials and celebrities throughout the years; its end eventually came due to the devaluation of the [[Mexican peso|peso]] in the 1980s and the new border crossing that takes tourist and locals away from the original heart of Mexicali. Currently there are more than 80 Chinese restaurants from small coffee shops ''(cafés de chinos)'' to huge 750 occupancy dining rooms. Nowadays, there are about 2,000 Chinese Mexicans living in the city; however, there are 100,000 residents more than thought who are of Chinese descent .{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Tijuana===
{{Main article|La Mesa (Tijuana)}}
The Chinese enclave in the Mexican city of [[Tijuana]] is located in [[La Mesa (Tijuana)|La Mesa]].  The enclave is home to 15,000 ethnic Chinese immigrants as of 2012, a number that has tripled from about 5,000 in 2009.&lt;ref name=sdr1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegored.com/noticias/22518/15-000-Chinese-migrants-thriving-in-Tijuana|title=15,000 Chinese migrants thriving in Tijuana}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The enclave is the second largest after the American enclave.&lt;ref name=sdr1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sdr2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.sandiegoreader.com/news/2015/jul/18/stringers-chun-kun-lady-egg-rolls-tijuana-vendor/?templates=mobile|title=Chun kun!: Popular Tijuana spring roll vendor stops for an interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mayor of Tijuana [[Jorge Hank Rhon]] had received negative publicity from the local newspapers for his support for the official establishment of the Chinatown as there is general negative sentiment from locals who view China as a major rival for trade with the United States.&lt;ref name=Hearn&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIjFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT6&amp;lpg=PT6&amp;dq=tijuana+chinatown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5EtqTBZNA-&amp;sig=StYPBgs-NX5i1PMjnfqrfo7RbtM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmnoW9ku7OAhXFJR4KHTgDDl04ChDoAQhUMA4#v=onepage&amp;q=tijuana%20chinatown&amp;f=false|title=Diaspora and Trust: Cuba, Mexico, and the Rise of China|author=Adrian H.

As Tijuana was a border town, it was an important city towards the establishment of the Mexicali Chinatown, where at the time, the Chinese community would outnumber Mexicans 2 to 1.  Though the numbers were far fewer in Tijuana, thousands would come through Tijuana on their way to [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]] and [[Mexicali]], a journey usually by foot for 120 miles to the east.&lt;ref name=Mexicali&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-16/news/vw-858_1_chinese-restaurants|title=The Chinese Border : Many Agree That Mexicali Owes Its Development to Asians}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1920s, the Chinese numbering around 15,000 would concentrate in Mexicali to avoid the Mexican civil war.  Racism would keep the population small for many decades until the early 2000s when [[Aeromexico]] would first offer direct flights from Tijuana to [[Japan]].  In 2008, the airline would offer direct flights to [[Shanghai]], making Tijuana the only Mexican city to offer such a route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2010/jan/12/china-lifting-ban-flights-mexico/|title=Tijuana-Shanghai flights to resume}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author has attributed the immigrant Chinese population rise to the direct flight, where there were 5,000 Chinese immigrants in 2009 and 15,000 by 2012.  In 2012, the Chinese community started making the enclave known in 2012, whereas the community largely kept to itself in years prior.  The Chinatown is one of the few recent Chinatowns that was not created from commercial ventures.&lt;ref name=sdr1/&gt;

==Panama==
The main Panamanian Chinatown is located in [[Panama City]] and is called the ''Barrio Chino'', located in the neighborhood of San Felipe in the City of Panama. It consist of four Portals, beginning in Carlos A. Mendoza Street, covering Veraguas Street and part of the Eloy Alfaro and B Avenue.  Most of the traditional Chinese shops are located in Carlos A. Mendoza Street, where you can find all kind of shops, which range from food, articles for parties and events, Chinese curiosities and a traditional Chinese food restaurante.

==Peru==
{{See also|Barrio Chino (Lima)}}
[[File:Chinatown Lima Peru.jpg|thumb|Chinatown in Lima]]
The main Peruvian Chinatown is located in [[Lima]] and is called the ''[[Chinatown, Lima|Barrio Chino]]'', located on Calle Capón (Block 7 of Ucayali Street); it is one of the two earliest Chinatowns in the Western Hemisphere, and contains various notably Chinese architectural features.

Other Peruvian cities with notable [[Chinese Peruvians|Chinese-Peruvian]] populations include [[Chimbote]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], and [[Chiclayo]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apch.com.pe/portal/comment/reply/122 Asociación Peruano-China] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016000000/http://www.apch.com.pe/portal/comment/reply/122 |date=October 16, 2008 }}, entry retrieved 5 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; all on the north coast, where Chinese immigrants were brought to work on sugar cane plantations. Historical Chinese immigration to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] region of [[Peru]] may be documented in a small village intriguingly named "[[Chino, Peru|Chino]]" several miles outside of [[Iquitos, Peru|Iquitos]].

==Venezuela==
[[Venezuela]] is also home to one of Latin America's largest concentrations of ethnic Chinese.The city of [[Valencia, Carabobo]] home of the major Chinese community hosts various markets devoted to Chinese culture where can be found from smoked ducks to authentic pottery. A local newspaper is also edited in Chinese. Not less relevant a lively ''barrio chino'' can be found on Avenida Principal El Bosque in the [[El Bosque, Caracas|El Bosque]] district of [[Caracas]].

Cantonese is widely spoken among [[Chinese Venezuelan]]s, especially the variety commonly known as Hoisan or Toisan, but there has been recent Taiwanese immigration, adding to the linguistic and cultural diversity. Chinese from other places of the world also settled in Venezuela, especially from the Philippines, where they were experienced persecution in the 1970s under [[Ferdinand Marcos]], and [[Cuba]], where Fidel Castro's Communist Revolution seized their businesses.

[[File:US Navy 050520-N-0780F-008 Storekeeper First Class Lonnie Campton, assigned to USS Taylor (FFG 50), serves as color guard for the American flag during the opening ceremony of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) and the Military Co.jpg|thumb|275px|A colour guard detactment during the opening ceremony for the [[North Atlantic Council]] and [[NATO Military Committee|Military Committee]] SEA Day Exercise.]]
In [[Military|military organizations]], a '''colour guard''' (or ''color guard'') is a detachment of soldiers assigned to the protection of [[Colours, standards and guidons|regimental colours]]. This duty is so prestigious that the colour is generally carried by a young officer ([[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]), while experienced non-commissioned officers ([[colour sergeant]]s) are assigned to the protection of the flag. These NCOs, accompanied sometimes by warrant officers (as is the case in several countries), can be ceremonially armed with either [[sabre]]s or [[rifle]]s to protect the colour. Colour guards are generally dismounted, but there are also mounted colour guard formations as well.

==History==
[[File:Mazurovsky - Fight for the banner (1805), 1910-12.jpg|thumb|upright|Fight for the flag between French [[line infantry]] and [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Russian Guard]] [[cuirassier]]s at the [[battle of Austerlitz]] (1805).]]
{{Main|Military colours, standards and guidons}}
As armies became trained and adopted set formations, each [[regiment|regiment's]] ability to keep its formation was potentially critical to its, and therefore its army's, success. In the chaos of battle, not least due to the amount of dust and smoke on a battlefield, soldiers needed to be able to determine where their regiment was. Flags and banners have been used by many armies in battle to serve this purpose.

Regimental flags were generally awarded to a regiment by a head-of-State during a ceremony and colours may be inscribed with [[battle honours]] or other symbols representing former achievements. They were therefore treated with reverence as they represented the honour and traditions of the regiment. The loss of a unit's flag was not only shameful, but losing this central point of reference could make the unit break up. So regiments tended to adopt colour guards, a detachment of experienced or élite soldiers, to protect their colours. As a result, the capture of an enemy's standard was considered as a great feat of arms.

Due to the advent of modern weapons, and subsequent changes in tactics, colours are no longer used in battle, but continue to be carried by colour guards at events of formal character.

==Current use==
===Commonwealth of Nations===
[[File:Presentation of Colours March Off RRC.JPG|thumb|left|The old colours of the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] are marched off by colour guards, during the presentation of new colours to the regiment.]]
Colour guards are used in the military throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Jamaica]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. A colour guard unit typically consists of the [[standard-bearer]], who is of the rank of [[second lieutenant]] or equivalent (pilot officer or sub-lieutenant), positioned in the centre of the colour guard, flanked by two or more individuals, typically armed with rifles or sabres. A colour sergeant major typically stands behind the colours carrying a pace stick. So, the formation (when the colours are combined on parade) is as follows:

* Colour Sergeants carrying rifles
* Ensigns
* Sergeant of the Guard
* Colour Sergeant Major behind the colour

Aside from [[Present arms (command)|presenting arms]] and sabres,  colour guards of the Commonwealth of Nations are expected to lower their flags to the ground in full and regular salutes in ceremonies and parades. Civilians should stand during such times and soldiers are expected to salute them when not in formation.

====United Kingdom====
As the British Army, the Royal Air Force, the Royal Marines and the Royal Navy have several types of colours, there are also colour guards for these colours and these colours and their colour guards are as follows:

=====British Army (infantry)=====
[[File:Colour Sergeant, Welsh Guards, with pace stick.jpg|thumb|upright|Colour Sergeant of the [[Welsh Guards]]. Note the distinctive shoulder insignia on the upper arm.]]
* Queen's Colour - [[Union Flag]] (Crimson with insignia and the honours for the [[Guards Division]])
*: Colour Sergeants and Ensign
* State Colour - Crimson with insignia and the honours and the Royal Cypher at the corners, used only for the [[Guards Division]] in ceremonies in the presence of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh
*:Colour Sergeants and Ensign
* Regimental Colour - Union Flag on the canton with the Regimental Arms and honours
** [[Foot Guards]] regiments (Union Flag)
** Royal Regiments (navy blue)
** [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] (green)
** other regimental colours
*: same as in the Queen's Colour
* Combined Colour Guards (units)
*: Colour Sergeants, Ensign, Guard Sergeant of the Colours, Colour Sergeant Major

=====British Army (cavalry)=====
In the cavalry, the Queen's Standard or Guidon and the Regimental/Squadron Standard or Guidon (for the light cavalry only) are the equivalents to the Queen's and Regimental Colours.
* Queen's Standard - Crimson with the Royal coat of arms, the [[Royal Cypher]] and the regimental honours
*: Colour Sergeant/Corporal of Horse, Warrant Officers
* Regimental/Squadron Standard/Guidon - Crimson or scarlet or other colours with the Royal Cypher, the Union Badge, regimental insignia and honours (only guidons are swallow tailed)
*: same as in the Queen's Standard/Guidon
* Combined Colour Guards (units)
*: Colour Corporals/Sergeants, Warrant Officers, Guard Corporal/Sergeant of the Colours, Colours Corporal Major (Household Cavalry), Colours Sergeant Major (other cavalry and armour units)

Colour guards in the artillery units are technically the lead gun's crew and leader (except in the Honourable Artillery Company which uses both guns and Colours) and there are no colour guards in the rifle regiments (nowadays [[The Rifles]]), the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (which use the Queen's Truncheon) and in the Royal Hospital in Chelsea.

=====Royal Navy=====
All of the RN's Queen's Colours are identical. Within the RN a colour guard unit consists of:

* Queen's Colour - [[White Ensign]] defaced with the Sovereign's cypher and inscribed with honours
*: Ensigns and Escorts
* White Ensign
*: Same as Queen's Colour
* Combined Colour Guards
*: Escorts, Ensigns, Guard Sergeant of the Colours, CSM

======Royal Marines======
* Queen's Colour - Union Jack with the Sovereign's cypher and the RM emblem and motto with the "Gibraltar" battle honour
*: Ensigns and Escorts
* Regimental Colour - Union Jack on the canton and dark blue with HM King George IV's cypher and the unit name, and the Sovereign's cypher on the other corners
*: Enisgns and Escorts
* Combined Colour Guards for the RM
*: Escorts, Ensigns, Guard Sergeant of the Colours, CSM

=====Royal Air Force=====
[[File:London the mall - Queen's Colour Squadron - 14.JPG|thumb|Colour guard for the [[Royal Air Force]].]]
* Queen's Colour  - [[Royal Air Force Ensign]] with the Sovereign's cypher and the RAF roundel
*: Ensign and Armed escorts
* RAF Ensign
*: Same as Queen's Colour
* Squadron Colour - Air Force blue with the unit insignia and honours
*: same as Queen's Colour
* Combined Colour Guards (units)
*: Colour Sgts., Ensigns, Guard Sergeant of the Colours, CSM

=== China ===
[[File:PLA soldiers.jpg|thumb|Colour guards of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.]]
In the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]], colour guards composed of

* One ensign holding the flag of the People's Liberation Army as the national colour domestically or the [[flag of China]] abroad
* Two officers or senior NCOs assisting the ensign holding rifles

In the parades of the 1950s, this configuration was present in every unit of the PLA up to the parade of 1959.

Since 1981, the PLA has continued a tradition of the color guard detail with the PLA flag leading the [[Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion]] in military parades. In December 2017, the Beijing Garrison Color Guard Company of the [[People's Armed Police]], which is present during flag ceremonies in Tiananmen Square in Beijing carrying the national flag, was officially attached to the honor guard battalion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.waonews.com/news/1436-The_historical_moment_Armed_Police_Tiananmen_flag_guard_cancel_the_designation_to_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
[[File:Republican Guard Bastille Day 2013 Paris t113201.jpg|left|thumb|A mounted French colour guard]]
French colour guards are composed of:

* One ensign holding the [[flag of France]] as the national colour
* Two non-commissioned officers assisting the ensign 
* Three enlisted personnel behind to guard the colour

The colour guards of France's military academies tend to wear swords; those of NCO schools, other educational institutions and active units carry rifles instead. This design is used in other countries with Francophone populations.

French color guards render honors on the command of [[present arms (command)|present arms]] (présentez arme). On command, the 2 NCOs and 3 enlisted will execute present arms, whether it be by presenting their sabre vertically or by putting the right hand over the handle of their weapon while the ensign lowers the national color/unit color somewhere close to their legs. On some occasions, the flag is not lowered unless the guard is in the presence of a dignitary (such as the [[President of the Republic]]) or a military leader (such as the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (France)|Chief of the Defence Staff]]).

=== Indonesia ===
''Pasukan Penjaga Panji-Panji/Pataka/Tunggul'' is the Indonesian term for a colour guard unit in the  [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]], the [[Indonesian National Police]] and the [[Municipal Police (Indonesia)|Municipal Police Units]]. These are modeled on the former Dutch practice and are led by a colour sergeant (massed colour guards are led on parade by a junior officer). ''Panji-Panji'' means "Service Colours" in Indonesian. The Colour guard uniform in Indonesia is all-white uniform with a white ceremonial combat helmet similar to the [[M1 helmet]] and white boots. If in the Armed Forces and the National Police, the escort personnel carry the M1, M-16, FN FAL or Pindad SSD-1 rifle while the colour officer carries his/her sabre.

[[File:Indonesian army colour guard.png|thumb|upright|An [[Indonesian Army]] colour guard]]
'''Composition of the Indonesian colour guard unit'''
* Colour officer
* Lead squad carrying the unit colour or national flag
** One colour sergeant/ensign
** Two non-commissioned officers escorting the colour
* Relief squad 
** One replacement colour sergeant/ensign
** Two non-commissioned officers
* Rear guard squad of three enlisted personnel (2 squads of 3-4 in the Indonesian Marine Corps)

===Netherlands===
The Dutch armed forces have similar ranks corresponding to a colour guard, the ''vaandrig'' and ''kornet'' (aspirant officers who have not been sworn in yet).

=== Russia and Commonwealth of Independent States ===
[[File:US Navy 100510-N-8288P-022 A Russian honor guard marches during the opening ceremony of the 65th anniversary of the Victory in Europe Day parade.jpg|thumb|Colour Guard of the  [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] at the 2010 Victory Day Parade in [[St. Petersburg]].]]
Russian colour guards are composed of:

* Colour officer
* One ensign or senior NCO holding the [[flag of Russia]] as the national colour or the unit color 
* Two enlisted personnel assisting the ensign

Active units, military academies, and guards of honor carry sabers in the color guard, if needed, rifles may be substituted. The same design is used for color guards in countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. If there are multiple color guards marching in a parade at the same time, one guard is required to march directly behind the first guard. During the Soviet era, the [[Soviet flag]] was never allowed to be paraded by a military color guard, with military and regimental flags only being paraded in color guards. On occasion during the Soviet era, the [[Victory Banner]] was also used in color guard teams, with the last known occasions being in 1975, 1977, 1985, 1987 and 1990. Turkmenistan and until 2014, Ukraine,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Ukraine left the CIS in 2014&lt;/ref&gt; were the only countries in the CIS whose army color guards dipped their flags as a salute.

=== Serbia ===
Given a shared heritage with Austria and Turkey plus its own traditions, the modern Serbian Armed Forces maintains a colour guard component. Every unit of the Armed Forces has a colour company that is made up of:

* Colour company commander
* Colour guard
** One ensign
** 2 armed senior NCOs serving as colour escorts
* 2 honor guard platoons guarding the colour from the rear

===Sweden===
[[File:Riksmotet2011 1c568 9303.jpg|thumb|Swedish ceremonial colour guard at the opening of the [[Riksdag]] in 2011.]]
In Sweden the colour guard can be composed in three distinct manners: Greater colour guard, smaller colour guard and an officers guard. Each regiment, or military unit that carries a colour, in Sweden sets up its own colour guard. The Swedish military rank of [[fänrik]] (and the corresponding cavalry rank of ''kornet'') was originally intended for the holder of the company flag. This duty was considered so prestigious that an officer was necessary to carry it out. Today, it is a regular officer rank.

====Greater colour guard====
This is composed of two commissioned officers, called ''fanförare'' (''carriers of the colour'') and eight enlisted soldiers. This stems from the time of king [[Gustavus Adolphus]] and the [[Thirty years war]] when all Swedish regiments had eight battalions. Each battalion contributed one soldier to the common colour guard.

====Small colour guard====
This is composed of one commissioned officer and four enlisted soldiers.

====Officers guard====
This is composed of three commissioned officers.

===United States===
In the [[military of the United States]], the ''color guard'' (where the word '''color''' is referring to the national '''flag''') carries the [[Colours, standards and guidons#United States|National Color]] and other [[flag]]s appropriate to its position in the [[chain of command]]. Typically these include a [[Military unit|unit]] flag and a departmental flag ([[United States Department of the Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]], [[United States Department of the Air Force|Air Force]], or [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]). In addition to the flag bearers, who are positioned in the center of the color guard, there are two or more individuals who carry [[rifle]]s and or [[sabre]]s. This is a symbol that the flag (and its nation) will always be protected.

====Composition of the US color guard====
[[File:2009 Non-commissioned Officer Parade DVIDS173390.jpg|thumb|A color guard detachment from the [[3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment]] in full dress. Color guards of the U.S. Armed Forces typically wear full-dress, or less formal attire.]]
In the U.S., traditionally, the unit's [[sergeant major]] is responsible for the safeguarding, care, and display of the organizational colors. The sergeant major is also responsible for the selection, training, and performance of the members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf FM 22-5, Section 9, Paragraph 43 (e)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614121926/http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }} ([[United States Department of the Army]])&lt;/ref&gt; The color guard consists of [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] members and is commanded by the senior (color) [[Sergeant]], who carries the National Color and gives the necessary commands for movements and rendering honors during drill exercises or [[parade]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf FM 22-5, Section 9, Paragraph 45 (a)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614121926/http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }} ([[United States Department of the Army]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Being assigned to the color guard is considered an honor due to the fact that these individuals present and carry the symbols of their unit and country. Depending on the circumstance and subject to the orders of their commander, members may wear [[Dress uniform|full dress]] or less formal [[Military uniform|uniforms]]. It is mandatory for all members of the color guard to wear headgear, for example, a [[garrison cap]], [[beret]], or [[service cap]]. On occasion, certain color guards can be [[horse]]-[[Riding animal#Riding animals or mounts|mounted]].

A US color guard is made up of a "Color Sergeant" carrying the National Colors, a unit or command "Color Bearer", and two "Color Escorts".

====Manoeuvering====
The color guard is formed and marched in one rank at close interval (shoulder-to-shoulder). Since the National Colors must always be in the position of honor on the right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/FM_3-21.5_Drill_and_Ceremonies.pdf |title=FM 3-21.5 (FM 22-5) Drill and Ceremonies |last1=Morrow |first1=JoyceE. |last2=Schoomaker |first2=Peter K. |date=July 2003 |website=Center of Military History |publisher=United States Army |page=K-3 |accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the color guard must execute a special movement to reverse direction. It does not execute rear march, nor does it execute about face. Rather, it performs a maneuver derived from the standard countercolumn command, generally known as ''counter march'' or ''colors reverse march'', in order to keep the precedence of flags in order.
Other drill movements performed by the color guard include [[Salute#Small arms salutes|presenting arms]], left and right wheel (turns) marches, eyes right (upon passing the reviewing stand during a parade), [[Casing of the Colors|casing/uncasing the colors]], and fixing/unfixing [[bayonet]]s (by the arms bearers).

====Rendering honors====
[[File:USMC Color Guard.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[United States Marine Corps]] color guard during the playing of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]". Note that the national flag does not dip.]]
=====By the color guard=====
The color guard renders honors when the national anthem is played or sung, when passing in review during a parade, or in certain other circumstances. In these cases, the unit and departmental flags salute by dipping (leaning the flag forward). However, with the exception of a response to a naval salute, the United States national flag renders no salute.  This is enshrined in the [[United States Flag Code]] and U.S. law.

=====To the color guard=====
In the U.S. military, individuals or units passing or being passed by uncased (unfurled) colors render honors when outdoors. Individuals who are not part of any formation begin the hand salute when the colors are six paces distant and hold it until they have passed six paces beyond the colors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf FM 22-5, Section 9, Paragraph 43 (c)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614121926/http://www.uwyo.edu/armyrotc/cadetresources/infolibrary/fm225/ch9.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }} ([[United States Department of the Army]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilians are expected to stand at the position of attention with their right hand placed over their heart for the same period, and the hand salute applies to the uniformed organizations as well (especially the Boy Scouts of America). Since recently, veterans are expected to hand salute the colors too, like their military counterparts including personnel not in uniform.

A '''crew''' is a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] organization. A location in which a crew works is called a '''crewyard''' or a '''workyard'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Management|last=Dubrin|first=Andrew J.|publisher=South-Western publishing, Co.|year=2006|isbn=9780324321104|location=Nashville, TN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a [[chain of command]]. Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes [[Commissioned officer|officer]]s from crew, though the two groups combined form the ship's company. Members of a crew are often referred to by the title ''[[Crewman]]''.

''Crew'' also refers to the sport of [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], where teams row competitively in racing shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrower.com/index.htm |title=Speed Rower, Competitive Rowing |accessdate=2009-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609130144/http://www.speedrower.com/index.htm |archivedate=June 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Ghana}}
'''[[Ghana]]''' is a country of 28.21 million people, comprising many native groups, such as:&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Arhin: "The Political Systems of Ghana. Background to transformations in traditional authority in the colonial and post-colonial periods." Historical Society of Ghana, 2002. {{ISBN|9988-8276-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the [[Akan people|Akans]] in the centre and South of the country;
* the [[Ga people|Ga]] and [[Adangbe]] in, around and East of [[Accra]];
* the [[Guang people]]s in the rain forest;
* the [[Dagomba people|Dagombas]], [[Mamprusi people|Mamprusi]] and related peoples in the North;
* the [[Gurunsi languages]] speaking peoples in the far North;
* the [[Gonja people|Gonja]]s in Northern Region.

[[English language|English]] is the official language, but the indigenous [[Akan language|Twi]] of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]]s, the [[Fante language]], [[Frafra language|Frafra]], [[Dangme language|Dangme]], [[Ga language|Ga]], [[Dagbani language|Dagbani]], [[Mampruli language|Mampruli]], [[Gonja language|Gonja]] and [[Ewe language|Ewe]] also have official status and are taught in schools as indigenous (local) languages in the respective areas where they are predominant.

==People==
=== Akans ===
The [[Akan people]] live in Akanland, and are one of the few [[matrilineal]] societies in West Africa. The matrilineal system of the Akan continues to be economically and politically important. Each lineage controlled the land farmed by its members, functioned as a [[Ashanti mythology|religious]] unit in the veneration of its ancestors, supervised marriages, and settled internal disputes among its members.

Akan kings, once renowned for their splendor and wealth, retained dignitary status after colonization. Celebration of the Akan kings lives on in the tradition of the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]]. The Akan are noted for their expertise in several forms of craftwork, particularly their [[weaving]], [[wood carving]], [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[Akuaba|fertility dolls]], [[metallurgy]] and [[kente cloth]]). Traditional ''[[kente]]'' cloth is woven outdoors, exclusively by men, in complex patterns of bright, narrow strips. The manufacturing of many Akan crafts is restricted to male specialists. Pottery-making is the only craft that is primarily a female activity; men usually fashion pots or pipes depicting [[anthropomorphic]] or [[zoomorphic]] figures.

The various Akan groups speak various dialects of the [[Akan language]], a language rich in [[proverb]]s, and the use of proverbs is considered to be a sign of wisdom. [[Euphemism]]s are also very common, especially concerning events connected with death.

The coastal Akans were the first to have relations with [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] during the "[[Scramble for Africa]]". As a result of this long association, these groups absorbed aspects of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] culture and language. For example, it became customary among these peoples to adopt British surnames. The coastal Akans live predominantly in the [[Central Region, Ghana|Central Region]] and [[Western Region, Ghana|Western Region]] of Akanland.

===Ga-Adangbe===
{{Main|Ga-Adangbe people}}
The Ga-Adangbe people ''or simply'' Ga people (named for the common proto-Ga-Adangbe ancestral language) inhabit the Greater [[Accra]] Region. The [[Adangbe]] inhabit the eastern plain, while the [[Ga language|Ga]] groups occupy the western portions of the Accra coastlands. Both languages are derived from a common root language, and modern Ga and Adangbe languages are still similar today.

Despite the archeological evidence that photo-Ga-Adangbe-speakers relied on [[millet]] and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]], the modern Ga-Adangbe reside in what used to be fishing communities, and more than 75 percent of the Ga-Adangbe live in urban centers. The presence of major industrial, commercial, and governmental institutions in the city and towns, as well as increasing [[Human migration|migration]] of other people into the area, has not prevented the Ga people from maintaining aspects of their traditional culture, even though [[Twi]] is an important [[immigrant language]] in their lands. As a result, they have dynamic

=== Dagomba ===
{{Main|Dagomba people}}
The Dagomba speak [[Dagbani language]] (Dagbane). The Dagomba reside in Dagbon (Northern Ghana). For centuries, the area inhabited by Dagomba peoples has been the scene of movements of people engaged in conquest, expansion, and north-south and east-west trade. Many terms from [[Arabic]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Dioula language|Dyula]] are seen in the Dagbani language, due to the importance of [[trans-saharan trade]] and [[West African]] trade and the historic impact that the [[Islam]]ic religion has had in the area.{{clear}}

===Ewé===
{{Main|Ewe people}}
The [[Ewe people]] occupy southeastern Ghana and parts of neighboring [[Togo]] and [[Benin]]. The Ewe follow a [[patrilineal]] structure, meaning that the founder of a community becomes chief and is usually succeeded by his paternal relatives. Ewe religion is organized around a creator or deity, [[Mawu]], and over 600 other deities. The Ewe are more traditionally inclined in terms of religion and belief. Many village celebrations and ceremonies take place in honor of one or more deities.

Coastal Ewe depend on the fishing trade, while inland Ewe are usually farmers and keep livestock. The local variations in economic activities have led to craft specialization. The Ewe also weave kente cloth, often in geometrical patterns and symbolic designs that have been handed down through the ages.

==Role and status of women==
{{Main|Women in Ghana}}
Women in pre-modern society were seen as bearers of children, retailers of fish, and farmers. Traditionally, women's childbearing abilities were perceived as a way for  lineage ancestors to be reborn. In [[History of Ghana|pre-colonial]] times, [[polygamy]] was encouraged, especially by wealthy men. In [[patrilineal]] societies, [[dowry]] received from marrying off daughters was traditionally seen as an acknowledgment to parents for raising their daughters well. In the last couples of decades, the female gender roles have evolved tremendously. Ghanaian women now comprise 43.1% of the working class in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Awumbila|first=Mariama|date=2006|title=Gender equality and poverty in Ghana: implications for poverty reduction strategies|jstor=41148110|journal=GeoJournal|volume=67|issue=2|pages=149–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females have climbed to the upper leadership echelons of politics, career, business, and all other sectors. Notable political personalities include [[Joyce Bamford-Addo]] (Speaker of the 5th Session of the Parliament), [[Georgina Theodora Wood]] (Chief Justice) as well as multiple past and current political office holders. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Festival==
The [[Panafest]] celebrates [[Kinship and descent|roots]], and [[African-Americans]] with roots from the region, often visit and celebrate their [[Tradition|heritage]].

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Ghana}}
There are three distinct types of music: ethnic or traditional music,&lt;ref&gt;Music of Ghana&lt;/ref&gt; normally played during festivals and at funerals; "[[highlife]]" music, which is a blend of traditional and ‘imported’ music; and [[choral]] music, which is performed in concert halls, churches, schools, and colleges.

==Dance==
Each ethnic group has their own traditional dances, with specific dances for different occasions. Some of these specific dances are meant for funerals, celebrations, storytelling, praise and worship. There are various dances in Ghana performed by the ten regions across the country, most frequently during festivals and occasions such as funerals, marriage ceremonies, etc. These dances are performed to entertain and educate people.( e.g. The 'Gome' dance, as performed by the Gas of the Greater Accra region of Ghana during the Homowo festival  in August). Other dances in Ghana includes kpalongo performed by the Gas, Agbadza by the Ewes, Adowa by the Akans, Bambaya by the Northners, Patsa by the Ga-Adangbes, and many others.

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Ghanaian cuisine}}
The cuisine has diverse traditional dishes from each ethnic group. Generally, most dishes consist of a starchy portion, and a sauce or soup, with [[fish]], [[snails]], [[meat]] or [[mushrooms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://mosaicscience.com/story/bushmeat-ghana|title=Inside Ghana’s biggest bushmeat market|website=Mosaic|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
[[File:Stadium tamale2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Tamale Stadium]]]]
[[Association football]] is the most popular sport in the country. The [[Ghana national football team|national men's football team]] is known as the ''Black Stars'', with the [[Ghana national under-20 football team|under-20 team]] known as the ''Black Satellites''. The [[Ghana national under-17 football team|under-17 team]] is known as the ''Black Starlets'', while the [[Ghana national under-23 football team|national men's Olympic team]] are known as the ''Black Meteors''. They have participated in many championships including the [[African Cup of Nations]], the [[FIFA World Cup]] and the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]].

On October 16, 2009, Ghana became the first African nation to win the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]] by defeating [[Brazil]] 4-3 in a penalty shootout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kenyon |first=Matthew |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/8311196.stm |title=NEWS.BBC.co.uk |publisher=NEWS.BBC.co.uk |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 13, 2010, Ghana defeated Serbia 1-0 in first round play in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] becoming the first African team to win a FIFA World Cup game hosted on African soil and subsequently became the only African team to progress from the group stage to the knock out phase at the 2010 event. On June 26, 2010 Ghana defeated the USA by 2 goals to 1 in their round of 16 match, becoming the third African country to reach the quarter final stage of the World Cup after Cameroon in 1990 and Senegal in 2002.  A loss to [[Uruguay]] in [[Johannesburg]] on July 2, 2010 by penalty shoot-out ended Ghana's attempt at reaching the semi-finals of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_50 |title=USA 1-2 Ghana (aet) |publisher=NEWS.BBC.co.uk |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While men's football is most widely followed sport in Ghana, the national women's football team is gaining exposure, participating in the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] and the [[CAF Women's Championship]]. The [[Ghana women's national football team]] is known as the ''Black Queens'', while the Ghana national women's under-20 football team are called the ''Black Princesses''.

There are several club football teams in Ghana, which play in the [[Ghana Premier League]] and [[Ghana Football Leagues|Division One league]], both managed by the [[Ghana Football Association]]. Notable among these are [[Accra Hearts of Oak SC]] and [[Asante Kotoko]], which play at the premier league level and are the dominant contenders in the tournament.

Prominent football players recognized at the international level include [[Tony Yeboah]], [[Michael Essien]], [[Kevin-Prince Boateng]], [[Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu]], [[Abedi Pele]], [[Asamoah Gyan]], [[Anthony Annan]], [[Quincy Owusu-Abeyie]], [[John Pantsil]], [[Samuel Kuffour|Samuel Osei Kuffour]], [[Richard Kingson]], [[Sulley Muntari]], [[Laryea Kingston]], [[Stephen Appiah]], [[André Ayew]], [[John Mensah]] and [[Dominic Adiyiah]].

'''Dablot Prejjesne''' (also called '''Dablo''') is a two-player [[Abstract strategy game|strategy]] [[board game]] of the [[Sámi people]], noted to have been played in the [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lappland]] region of [[Sweden]]. Dablot Prejessne in Sámi actually means "To play Dablo on a board" .  The game represents the struggle between nomadic [[Sami people|Sami]] people and landowners.

==Description==
The Sami people are represented in this game with one piece representing the Sami King ("gånneka"), one piece representing the Sami Prince ("gånnekan alke"), and 28 pieces representing their soldiers or warriors ("dårake"), . The landowners are represented with one piece representing the landowner, one piece representing the landowner's son, and 28 pieces representing their peasants.  The game is a relative of [[draughts]] and [[Alquerque]].  Pieces leap over one another to capture.  However, the similarities basically end there. In draughts and Alquerque, any piece can capture ''any'' enemy piece whether that enemy piece is a King or not.  In Dablot Prejessne, pieces can only capture each other if they are of the same rank or lower.  They cannot capture pieces of a higher rank.  The Sami King and the landowner are the highest ranked pieces and are equal in rank, therefore, they can capture each other and all other pieces.  The Sami Prince and the landowner's son are the second highest ranked pieces, and are of equal rank.  The Sami Prince can not capture the landowner, and likewise, the landowner's son can not capture the Sami King.  However, they can capture each other, and all the other pieces.  The 28 soldiers or warriors and the 28 peasants are the lowest ranked pieces.  The 28 soldiers or warriors can not capture the landowner or the landowner's son.  Likewise, the 28 peasants cannot capture the Sami King or the Sami Prince.  However, they can capture each other.  All pieces do move alike, and can move and capture in any direction.  There is no promotion of pieces in Dablot Prejjesne.

Its closest relative in the draught family may be [[Italian checkers]] and [[Italian Damone]].  In all these games, a lower rank piece can not capture a higher rank piece.  However, in Dablot Prejjesne ranks are pre-determined, and never change, whereas, in Italian checkers, pieces must be promoted to King in order to gain higher rank.  In Italian Damone there are pre-determined ranked pieces also, however, it is played on an 8 x 8 draughts board with far less pieces as compared to Dablot Prejjesne.

The board used is very similar to that of [[Kharbaga]].  The difference is that in Kharbaga, the board is 4 x 4 or 5 x 5 whereas in Dablot Prejjesne, the board is 6 x 7.

==Goal==
A player wins if it captures all their opponent's pieces.  There are additional winning conditions common in variants; see the rules section below. A draw is possible by mutual agreement or after a number of turns made by each player without a capture.

==Equipment==
The board used is a 6 (width) x 7 (length) grid board with diagonal lines running through each "square" of the board. Pieces are placed on the intersections between gridlines similar to [[Alquerque]] and its variants, instead of within the square spaces as in other [[draughts]] variants.

Each player has 30 pieces total.  One player traditionally plays the Sami tribe which can be the red or white colored pieces, and one player plays the landowner party which can be the black colored pieces.

The Sami tribe consist of 1 Sami King piece, 1 Sami Prince piece, and 28 soldiers or warriors (referred to as soldiers in this article).  

The Landowner party consist of 1 Landowner piece, 1 Landowner's Son piece, and 28 peasants.

For simplicity, both sides' pieces can be referred to by the names of the Sami side (King, Prince and Soldiers), as the distinction between the names for each side's pieces has no significant in-game meaning. This article will however use the appropriate names for each side.

==Rules and gameplay==
1.  Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first.

2.  The 28 soldiers or peasants are initially set up on each player's half of the board, on each intersection of the gridlines of the first 5 ranks (including the intersections of the diagonals in between the "main" orthogonal grid).  The Sami Prince is placed on the sixth rank, on the intersection of diagonals to that player's farthest right. The Sami King is placed on the seventh rank, at the right edge of the board (please refer to the image above and the first external link below for a visual description of the initial setup for both Sami tribe and landowner party).  Similarly, the Landowner's Son and Landowner are placed on that player's farthest right on the sixth and seventh rank, respectively.

3. All pieces move alike. A piece moves one space along one of the gridlines to any adjacent, unoccupied intersection. All pieces can move forward or backward at any time. Only one piece may be moved per turn, or used to capture.

4. Pieces may capture other pieces by jumping over them, similar to [[draughts]]. The piece must jump over a single adjacent opposing piece, and land on an unoccupied space on the exact opposite side of the jumped piece from its starting location. The jumped opposing piece is removed from play. A piece cannot jump over two opposing pieces in one jump, nor may it jump over a piece of its own color or jump over a piece into a space that is occupied (whether by that player or his opponent). A piece can make multiple jumps in one turn, even changing direction from one jump to the next, as long as the prior rules are followed.

4a. As the original rules for Dablot Prejjesne are not completely known, it is unknown if capturing was originally compulsory. However, in modern play of the game, similar to other draughts variants, a player who has an available capture or chain of captures is required to make the capture(s). If the player has a choice regarding two or more pieces that can be used to capture, or between two or more "paths" for multiple captures by a single piece, the player may choose freely which piece to use or which sequence of captures to make, but cannot choose not to capture if one is possible.

5.  Pieces can only capture opposing pieces of equal or lower rank.  The Sami King and Landowner are the highest ranked pieces and are of equal rank to one another, therefore, they can capture each other, and all the other pieces.  The Sami Prince and the Landowner's Son are the second highest ranked pieces, and cannot capture the Sami King or Landowner; however, they can capture each other, and the other lower pieces.  The Sami soldiers and peasants are the lowest ranked pieces. They can not capture the Sami King or Sami Prince, or the Landowner or Landowner's Son; however, they can capture each other. This is a primary difference between Dablot and most other draughts variants.

6.  There is no promotion of pieces in this game; a player cannot recover a captured King, Landowner, Prince or Son, or augment their numbers of these pieces.

===Variations===
Some variants of this game include additional winning conditions which further speed the pace of the game, such as:
* Trapping all remaining opposing pieces so that one's opponent cannot make a move - This is a common secondary winning condition, making stalemate a victory for the player who forces it, instead of a draw.
* Capturing the opposing King or Landowner - this is usually a crippling blow to a player in any case, as he can no longer win by capturing all his opponent's pieces; he can only do so by trapping his opponent's remaining forces as above.
* Capturing both the opposing King/Landowner and the Prince/Son - At this point, in the conflict being modeled in the game, the lower-ranking forces would likely surrender. Again, it is still possible though more difficult to win after losing both the King and Prince, by trapping all opposing pieces to force a stalemate.

{{Use British English|date=March 2015}}
[[Deindustrialization|Deindustrialisation]] refers to the process of [[social]] and [[economic]] change caused by the removal or reduction of [[Industry|industrial]] capacity or activity in a country or region, especially heavy industry or manufacturing industry. It is the opposite of [[industrialisation]]. Deindustrialisation has taken place in many nations over the years, as social changes and [[urbanisation]] have changed the financial demographics of the world. Phenomena such as the mechanisation of labour render industrial societies obsolete, and lead to the de-establishment of industrial communities.

==Background==
Theories that predict or explain deindustrialisation have a long intellectual lineage. [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of declining (industrial) profit argues that technological innovation enables more efficient means of production, resulting in increased physical productivity, i.e., a greater output of use value per unit of capital invested. In parallel, however, technological innovations replace people with machinery, and the organic composition of capital increases. Assuming only labour can produce new additional value, this greater physical output embodies a smaller value and surplus value. The average rate of industrial profit therefore declines in the longer term.

[[George Reisman]] (2002) identified [[inflation]] as a contributor to deindustrialisation. In his analysis, the process of [[fiat money]] inflation distorts the economic calculations necessary to operate [[capital intensity|capital-intensive]] manufacturing enterprises, and makes the investments necessary for sustaining the operations of such enterprises unprofitable.

The term '''de-industrialisation crisis''' has been used to describe the decline of labour-intensive industry in a number of countries and the flight of jobs away from cities. One example is labour-intensive [[manufacturing]]. After [[free-trade agreement]]s were instituted with less developed nations in the 1980s and 1990s, labour-intensive manufacturers relocated production facilities to [[Third World]] countries with much lower wages and lower standards. In addition, technological inventions that required less manual labour, such as [[industrial robot]]s, eliminated many manufacturing jobs.

==Australia==
On 2008, four companies mass-produced cars in Australia.&lt;ref name="goauto.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassall |first= David |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/1B11FCD261CC6475CA2579DE00021DC5 |title=Tomcar - New local vehicle manufacturer |publisher=GoAuto |date=12 April 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia|Mitsubishi]] ceased production in March 2008, followed by [[Ford Australia|Ford]] in 2016, and [[Holden]] and [[Toyota Australia|Toyota]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-03/toyota-car-production-ends-altona-after-50-years-manufacturing/9007624 |title=Toyota workers out of jobs as car manufacturer closes Altona plant |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=6 December 2017 |access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holden bodyworks were manufactured at [[Elizabeth, South Australia]] and engines are produced at the Fishermens Bend plant in [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]].  In 2006, Holden's export revenue was just under {{AUD|link=yes}}1.3 billion.&lt;ref name="HoldenExports"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/corporate/about-holden/exports/vehicle-exports | title = Vehicle Exports | publisher = GM Holden | accessdate = 23 August 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090915170720/http://holden.com.au/corporate/about-holden/exports/vehicle-exports# | archive-date = 2009-09-15 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, Holden was given a $270&amp;nbsp;million lifeline by the Australian government.

Ford had two main factories, both in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]: located in the [[Geelong]] suburb of [[Norlane, Victoria|Norlane]] and the northern Melbourne suburb of [[Broadmeadows, Victoria|Broadmeadows]]. Both plants were closed down in October 2016.

Until 2006, Toyota had factories in [[Port Melbourne]] and [[Altona, Victoria]]. Since then, all manufacturing has been at Altona. In 2008, Toyota exported 101,668 vehicles worth $1,900&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="ToyotaExports-2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota.com.au/about/exports|title=Exports-2008 | publisher=Toyota Australia|accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the figures were "59,949 units worth $1,004&amp;nbsp;million".&lt;ref name="ToyotaExports-2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota.com.au/toyota/company/operations/exports |title=Exports-2011| publisher =Toyota Australia |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February 2014 it was announced that by the end of 2017 Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia.&lt;ref name=toyota-exit&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunckley |first=Mathew |url=http://www.portnews.com.au/story/2078487/toyota-confirms-exit-from-australian-manufacturing-in-2017/?cs=2452 |title=Toyota confirms exit from Australian manufacturing in 2017 |work=Port Macquarie News |publisher=Portnews.com.au |date=10 February 2014 |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until [[Free trade|trade liberalisation]] in the mid 1980s, Australia had a large [[textile]] industry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} This decline continued through the first decade of the 21st century.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  Since the 1980s, tariffs have steadily been reduced; in early 2010, the tariffs were reduced from  17.5 percent to 10 percent on clothing, and 7.5–10% to 5% for footwear and other textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acci.asn.au/text_files/media_releases/2010/003-10.pdf|title=ACCI Welcomes textiles and car tariff cuts (ACCI media release 003/10)|author=Peter Anderson|date=1 January 2010|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2010, most textile manufacturing, even by Australian companies, is performed in Asia.

==Austria==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
[[Austria]] has many indicators that justify labelling them as a deindustrialising country. Data collected from the OECD for Austria has shown that since 1956 total employment did grow until 1994 and since then remained relatively steady. Employment in industry and construction, however, has declined steadily as service sector employment has steadily increased. Data also shows that even as employment in industry and construction has decreased, industry productivity has continued to grow. 

Austrian unemployment has steadily increased since 1983 due to deindustrialisation. Austria was one of the countries in a study that showed that increasing overall unemployment was significantly related to manufacturing unemployment. Austria's foreign and domestic policy has made deindustrialisation possible. High labour taxes and high withholding taxes repel low-skill immigration as low capital taxes enable domestic capital investment. Stern banking secrecy policies, no withholding taxes for non-residents, joining the [[European Union]], and adopting the [[Euro]] enabled substantial growth in Austria's services sector.

==Belgium==
Data taken from the OECD website show that industrial employment in [[Belgium]] rose between 1999 and 2000 and then declined until 2003, rising again until 2006. The overall trend in industrial employment in Belgium, however, is still a decline. OECD data also shows that production and sales of total industry in Belgium has been on the rise since 1955, with the exception of small declines during a few years. Despite this trend, deindustrialisation is occurring at fairly rapid rates in Belgium. Variables such as large population increases and regional discrepancies account for these misleading statistics. Deindustrialisation is hitting the region of [[Wallonia]] much harder than the region of [[Flanders]]. Wallonia remains much more impoverished and has an unemployment rate of about 17% (twice that of the unemployment rate in Flanders). Other statistics displaying the effects of deindustrialisation in Belgium is the rise in employment in the service sector from 1999 until 2006. Today, industry is much less significant in Belgium than it has been in previous years.

==Canada==
Much of the academic literature pertaining to Canada hints at deindustrialisation as a problem in the older rust belt areas of Ontario and the east. Nationwide, over the past fifty years, according to 2008 OECD data, industrial production and overall employment have been steadily increasing. Industrial production levelled off a bit between 2004 and 2007, but its production levels are the highest that they have ever been. The perception of deindustrialisation that the literature refers to deals with the fact that although employment and economic production have risen, the economy has shifted drastically from manufacturing jobs to service sector jobs. Only 13% of the current Canadian population has a job in the industrial sector. Technological advancements in industry over the past fifty years have allowed for industrial production to keep rising during the Canadian economic shift to the service sector. 69% of the [[GDP]] of Canada comes from the service sector.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ CIA World Factbook] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5RSu3AP6O?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ |date=2007-08-29 }} 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven High, ''Industrial sunset: the making of North America's rust belt, 1969-1984'' (University of Toronto Press, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denmark==
Regarding [[Denmark]]'s industry, the country does not appear to be deindustrialising as a whole. Literature (Goldsmith and Larsen 2004) has stated that perhaps Denmark's size and "Nordic style" of governing has allowed it to hide from the detrimental effects of globalisation. Both men's and women's labour statistics (OECD data 2008) show a steady increase over the past decade. Despite a slight dip from 2001 to 2003, overall employment in Denmark has been at a steady increase since 1995. Denmark's total industry output has also been on the rise since the 1974, despite an economic [[recession]] from 1987 to 1993. The country's high employment and low unemployment rates have improved the production industry, and the high tax rates have strengthened the economy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Finland==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
Based on the data from the OECD website, [[Finland]] has been industrialising according to industrial employment and industrial production statistics. Finland has been considered very resilient based on its remarkable economic comeback after their recession in 1990 due to the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. During this time, production of total industry and civilian employment in industry declined rapidly. Finland has been ranked number one three times in the World Economic Forum competitiveness studies as one of the most developed IT economies since 2000. 

Since the 1990 recession, which was one of the largest in European history, Finland has managed to soar back to the top of the economic ladder. Finland has done so by focusing strongly on education. After their recession, Finland invested its money on boosting [[R&amp;D]], education, and retraining workers that had lost their job due to the recession. With its investment in education, Finland has succeeded in increasing some of its industries. For example, the [[forest industry]] now specialises in high-quality papers. As a result of investment in education and technology, Finland is now one of the world's largest producers of paper-making machinery. According to the statistics on the OECD website, Finland is not deindustrialising.

==France==
Data for [[France]] indicates that while employment in industry relative to the total French economy has decreased, there is a lack of sound evidence pointing to an overall trend of deindustrialisation. Research (Lee 2005, Feinstein 1999) shows that at the same time relative employment in industry is decreasing, total production in industry has almost quadrupled since the mid 20th century, levelling off only since about the year 2000 (OECD 2008). Lee shows that between 1962 and 1995, employment in industry in France fell 13.1% (2005:table 1). Advances in technology that allow for higher output by fewer employees, coupled with a change in the type of products manufactured domestically, such as the high-tech electronics now manufactured in France, explain the negative relationship of employment and output in French industry. Thus, it may feel like deindustrialisation is occurring because of the relative decrease of employment or highly publicised cases of outsourcing, yet the data suggest industry production in France is not suffering.{{original research inline|date=May 2011}}

==Germany==

===Historic===
In [[occupied Germany]] after [[World War II]] the [[Morgenthau Plan]] was implemented, although not in its most extreme version.&lt;ref name=Gareau&gt;Frederick H. Gareau, "Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany". ''The Western Political Quarterly'', Vol. 14, No. 2 (June 1961)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|530}} The plan was present in the U.S. occupation directive [[JCS 1067]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Beschloss, ''The Conquerors: Roosevelt, Truman and the Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1941–1945'', pg. 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gareau/&gt;{{rp|520}} and in the Allied "[[Allied plans for German industry after World War II|industrial disarmament]]" plans.&lt;ref name=Gareau/&gt;{{rp|520}} On February 2, 1946, a dispatch from [[Berlin]] reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Some progress has been made in converting [[Germany]] to an agricultural and light industry economy, said Brigadier General William H. Draper, Jr., chief of the American Economics Division, who emphasised that there was general agreement on that plan. He explained that Germany's future industrial and economic pattern was being drawn for a population of 66,500,000. On that basis, he said, the nation will need large imports of food and raw materials to maintain a minimum standard of living. General agreement, he continued, had been reached on the types of German exports — [[coal]], [[coke (fuel)|coke]], electrical equipment, [[leather]] goods, [[beer]], [[wine]]s, spirits, toys, musical instruments, textiles and apparel — to take the place of the heavy industrial products that formed most of Germany's pre-war exports.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Stewart Martin (military)|James Stewart Martin]]. ''All Honorable Men'' (1950) pg. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to some historians, the U.S. government abandoned the Morgenthau plan as policy in September 1946 with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]]' speech "[[Restatement of Policy on Germany]]".&lt;ref&gt;John Gimbel, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2147827 "On the Implementation of the Potsdam Agreement: An Essay on U.S. Postwar German Policy".] ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 87, No. 2. (Jun., 1972), pp. 242-269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that credit should be given to former U.S. President [[Herbert Hoover]], who in one of [[The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria|his reports from Germany]], dated March 18, 1947, argued for a change in occupation policy, amongst other things stating, "There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a 'pastoral state'. It cannot be done unless we exterminate or move 25,000,000 people out of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2008/webarticles/080103_marshallplan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414103548/http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2008/webarticles/080103_marshallplan.html |archivedate=2008-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worries about the sluggish recovery of the European economy, which before the war had depended on the German industrial base, and growing Soviet influence amongst a German population subject to food shortages and economic misery, caused the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and Generals [[Lucius D. Clay|Clay]] and [[George Marshall|Marshall]] to start lobbying the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] administration for a change of policy.&lt;ref name=Jennings&gt;[http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks49.pdf Ray Salvatore Jennings, "The Road Ahead: Lessons in Nation Building from Japan, Germany, and Afghanistan for Postwar Iraq".] May 2003, ''Peaceworks'' No. 49, pp. 14,15 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514021020/http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks49.pdf |date=14 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1947, President Harry S. Truman rescinded on "national security grounds"&lt;ref name=Jennings/&gt; the punitive occupation directive JCS 1067, which had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in Germany to "take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany [or] designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy". It was replaced by JCS 1779, which instead noted that "[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887417,00.html "Pas de Pagaille!"] [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']], July 28, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

It had taken over two months for General Clay to overcome continued resistance to the new directive JCS 1779, but on July 10, 1947, it was finally approved at a meeting of the SWNCC. The final version of the document "was purged of the most important elements of the Morgenthau plan."&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Petrov, ''Money and conquest; allied occupation currencies in World War II.'' Baltimore, [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] (1967) p. 236 (Petrov footnotes Hammond, ''American Civil-Military Decisions'', p. 443)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dismantling of (West) German industry ended in 1951, but "industrial disarmament" lingered in restrictions on actual German steel production, and production capacity, as well as in restrictions on key industries. All remaining restrictions were finally rescinded on May 5, 1955. "The last act of the Morgenthau drama occurred on that date or when the [[Saar Protectorate|Saar]] was returned to Germany."&lt;ref name=Gareau/&gt;{{rp|520}}

Vladimir Petrov concluded: "The victorious Allies … delayed by several years the economic reconstruction of the war torn continent, a reconstruction which subsequently cost the US billions of dollars."&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Petrov, ''Money and conquest; allied occupation currencies in World War II.'' Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press (1967) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

===Currently===
In the early 2000s, the unemployment in Germany was moderately high, while industrial output was steadily increasing. Germany's unemployment rate of roughly seven percent (OECD, 2008) is by and large due to the continuing struggles with the reunification process between [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] that began in 1990. However, the unemployment rate has been declining since 2005, when it reached its peak of over ten percent. In the 2010s, Germany's unemployment rate has been one of the lowest in continental Europe.

Between 2010 and 2017 the manufacturing employment in absolute terms has risen by 10% from 4.9 million workers to 5.4 million December 2016.

==India==
During the reign of the [[Mughal Empire]], [[India]] was the largest economy on Earth, accounting for roughly one-quarter of the world economy.&lt;ref name="Angus Maddison 2006 Page 263"&gt;Angus Maddison (2006), "The World Economy", OECD Publishing, {{ISBN|92-64-02261-9}}, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; It had strong agriculture and industry, and was the world's largest [[cotton]] textile manufacturer (particularly [[Bengal]]).&lt;ref name="gupta"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Bishnupriya|title=COTTON TEXTILES AND THE GREAT DIVERGENCE: LANCASHIRE, INDIA AND SHIFTING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, 1600-1850|url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|website=International Institute of Social History|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Warwick|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the latter half of the 18th century, India underwent political turmoil and Europeans (mainly British) got an opportunity to become political masters. During their rule, British [[mercantilism]] targeted weakening of the craft [[guild]]s, pricing and quota caps, and banning production of many products and commodities in India.

India's de-industrialization contributed to Britain's [[Industrial Revolution]], with India no longer being a competitor in the global [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile industry]], as well as India itself becoming a large market for British textiles. Britain eventually replaced India as the world's largest cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="gupta"/&gt;

==Ireland==
[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] has yet{{when|date=October 2012}} to de-industrialise. Industrial employment and production and sales in industry have increased since 1990, according to OECD data. The increase in industry coincided with the introduction of [[Intel]] to the Irish economy in late 1989. Though one may not think of Intel as industry in the same sense as steel production, it is considered to be industry. Intel is now the largest company by turnover in Ireland. This was the beginning of what was called the "[[Celtic Tiger]]" economy. [[Dell]] and [[Microsoft]] followed Intel to Ireland, creating a large software industry. As is evidenced by these three companies, a majority of the industries that exist in Ireland are a result of foreign direct investment. The top three FDIs are the US, the UK, and Germany.

==Italy==
Overall, [[Italy]] in 2008 did not seem to be deindustrialising. According to [http://www.oecd.org/statsportal/0,3352,en_2825_293564_1_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD (2008)]  data, the rate of industrial employment is at an all-time high, although, in general, it has stayed relatively consistent since 1956. The rate of industrial production is also on the rise after a small dip in recent years; even though production rates are still at almost 2 percent less than they were in 2000, the 2005 rate is eighty percent more than what it was in 1955. These figures, however, do not make the distinction between different regions of the country: according to Rowthorn and Ramaswamy (1999), most manufacturing plants are located in cities such as [[Genoa]] and [[Milan]] in Northern Italy, and the unemployment rate in the South is significantly higher than in the North. Prior to World War II, Italy's economy was mainly agricultural, but it has since shifted to become one of the largest industrial economies in the world. In general, Italy is continuing to experience a period of industrialisation that has been taking place since the shift.

==Japan==

===Historic===
To further remove [[Japan]] as a potential future military threat after World War II, the [[Far Eastern Commission]] decided that Japan must partly be de-industrialised. Dismantling of Japanese industry was foreseen to have been achieved when Japanese standards of living were reduced to those between 1930 and 1934&lt;ref name=Gareau/&gt;{{rp|531}} &lt;ref&gt;(A footnote in Gareau states: "For a text of this decision, see Activities of the Far Eastern Commission. Report of the Secretary General, February, 1946 to July 10, 1947, Appendix 30, p. 85.")&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Great Depression]]). In the end the adopted program of de-industrialisation in Japan was implemented to a lesser degree than the similar U.S. "industrial disarmament" program in Germany.&lt;ref name=Gareau/&gt;{{rp|531}}

===Current===
A notable event began in the 1990s as the [[economy of Japan]] suddenly stagnated after [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|three decades of tremendous economic growth]]. This could be construed as directly linked to deindustrialisation, as this phenomenon began to be recognised in [[developed countries]] of the world around this same time. However, Japan had larger economic problems, the effects of which can still be seen in the country's low economic growth today. According to data from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (2008), deindustrialisation is occurring in Japan. However, although industrial employment as a percentage of total employment has dropped over the last couple of decades in Japan, total employment has not.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Unemployment was fairly low at 3.5% in 2007,&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; and the economy is relatively stable. Literature (Matsumoto 1996) has stated that the service sector has been expanding and providing jobs for those that have been displaced from industry. Strong [[trade union|union membership]] has also played a role in keeping employment rates stable. Although outsourcing and industrial decline may contribute to job loss in industry, the shift in modern economies from industry to service may help reduce negative effects.

==Netherlands==
Much like many other OECD countries, the [[Netherlands]] is not experiencing deindustrialisation in the usual way one might think of it. While the OECD's Annual Labour Force Statistics Survey may show that industrial employment opportunities in the Netherlands have significantly decreased in the past 50 years, the OECD's Production and Sales MEI for Industry and Service Statistics shows that the overall production in the industrial sector has actually improved. The Netherlands, like many other countries, has advanced to produce more with less.

Also, perhaps in response to the decline in industrial sector employment, the service industry of the Netherlands has grown and expanded its employment opportunities. The timely response of alternatives for employment may have had something to do with the progressive policies the Netherlands has in place to complement the changes in industry. An example might include tax breaks for families where the father works full-time and the mother works part-time, also referred to as the "one-and-a-half breadwinner" policy.

==New Zealand==
[[New Zealand]] is in a phase of deindustrialisation starting in the late 1990s. The evidence for this phenomenon is apparent in the decrease of economic output, a shift from employment in the manufacturing sector to the service sector (which may be due to an increase in [[tourism]]), the dissipation of unions caused by immigration and individual work contracts, along with the influence on culture by highbrow mass media (like the internet) and technology. It is possible to interpret these trends in a different way due to the complex nature of the data and the difficulty in quantifying and calculating reliable results. These trends are important to study, because they might occur in waves that could help predict economic and cultural outcomes in the future.

With the reduction and removal of [[tariffs]] through the 1980s and 1990s plus the importation of second hand Japanese cars, the major assembly plants began to close. New Zealand Motor Corporation which had closed its aging [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]] plant in 1976 and [[Petone]] plant in 1982 closed their [[Panmure, New Zealand|Panmure]] plant in 1988. General Motors closed its Petone plant in 1984 and its [[Trentham, New Zealand|Trentham]] plant in 1990. 1987 saw a run of closures: Motor Industries International, [[Otahuhu]], Ford [[Seaview, Lower Hutt|Seaview]], Motor Holdings [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]]. Suzuki in [[Wanganui]] closed 1988 and VANZ (Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand a joint Ford and Mazda operation) at [[Sylvia Park]] in 1997. Toyota [[Christchurch]] in 1996 and VANZ [[Wiri]] the next year. Finally in 1998 along with Mitsubishi [[Porirua]], bought from Todd in 1987, Nissan shutdown at Wiri, Honda closed in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and Toyota in [[Thames, New Zealand|Thames]].&lt;ref name=MW2002&gt;Mark Webster, page 193 ''Assembly, New Zealand Car Production 1921–1998'' Reed 2002 {{ISBN|0 7900 0846 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Redundancies occurred in manufacturing industry; approximately 76,000 manufacturing jobs were lost between 1987 and 1992.&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;Judith Bell, ''I See Red'', Awa Press, Wellington: 2006, pp.22–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poland==
In [[Poland]], as in many other former [[communism|communist]] countries, [[deindustrialization|deindustrialisation]] occurred rapidly in the years after the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in 1989, with many unprofitable industries going [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] with the switch to [[market economy]], and other state-owned industries being destroyed by a variety of means, including arbitrarily changed credit and tax policies. The deindustrialisation in Poland was based on a [[neoliberalism]]-inspired doctrine (systemic transformation according to the [[Washington Consensus|requirements of Western financial institutions]]) and on the conviction that industry-based economy was a thing of the past. However, the extent of deindustrialisation was greater in Poland than in other European, including post-communist, countries: more than ⅓ of total large and midsize industrial assets were eliminated. The perceived economic reasons for deindustrialisation were reinforced by political and ideological motivations, such as removal of the remaining [[state socialism|socialist]] influences concentrated in large enterprises (opposed to rapid [[privatization]] and [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]], as prescribed by the [[Balcerowicz Plan]]) and by land [[speculation]] (plants were sold at prices even lower than the value of the land on which they were located). Among such "privatized" institutions there were many cases of [[Takeover#Types of takeover|hostile takeover]]s (involved in 23% of all assets transferred), when industrial entities were sold and then changed to the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] or liquidated to facilitate a takeover of the old company's market by the buying (typically foreign) firm.&lt;ref name="katastrofa forsal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forsal.pl/artykuly/888899,soroka-polska-po-1989-r-doswiadczyla-katastrofy-przemyslowej-musimy-odbudowac-nasz-potencjal.html|publisher=forsal.pl|date=2015-08-18|accessdate=2016-05-31|author=Paweł Soroka|title=Polska po 1989 r. doświadczyła katastrofy przemysłowej.

According to comprehensive research data compiled by economist Andrzej Karpiński and others, 25-30% of the reductions were economically justified, while the rest resulted from various processes that were controversial, often erroneous or pathological, including actions aimed at quick self-enrichment on the part of people with decision-making capacities. Unlike in the case of the Western deindustrialisation of the preceding years, in Poland modern competitive industries with established [[Market (economics)|market]]s were also eliminated, including the [[electronics|electronic]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[computer]], [[Outline of industrial machinery|industrial machinery]], [[weapon|armament]] and [[chemical industry|chemical]] industries. The abandoned domestic and foreign markets, often in [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Third World]] countries, had subsequently been taken over by non-Polish interests. Nearly half (47%) of the lost enterprises represented [[consumer]] product [[light industry]], rather than [[heavy industry]]. [[Capitalism|Capitalist]] Poland's early economic policies resulted in economic and social crises including high unemployment, and in what some see as irredeemable losses, impacting Poland's situation today. At the same time however, many constructive developments took place, including the widespread rise of [[entrepreneurship]], and, especially after Poland [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|joined the European Union]], significant [[economic growth]]. The transformation process, as executed, generally replaced large enterprises with small, creating an environment inimical to [[innovation]] but conducive to [[human capital flight]].&lt;ref name="katastrofa forsal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stracone szanse przeglad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="likwidacja forsal"/&gt;

The evaluation of Poland's economic advancement depends on the criteria used. For example, the country's industrial output had increased 2.4 times between 1989 and 2015, while the Polish [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]'s percentage of the [[gross world product]] dropped from 2.4 in 1980 to 0.5-0.6 in 2015. In a number of measured categories of progress, Poland places behind its [[European Union]] formerly communist near neighbors (the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Lithuania]]), which had not undertaken deindustrialisation policies as radical as that of Poland.&lt;ref name="stracone szanse przeglad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="likwidacja forsal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="w ogonie europy"&gt;Eugeniusz Guz, "Polska w ogonie Europy [Poland in the tail of Europe]". [[Przegląd]] magazine #22(856), 30 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Union==
Prior to its dissolution in 1991, the [[USSR]] had [[economy of the Soviet Union|the second largest economy in the world]] after the United States.&lt;ref name=cia1990&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact90/world12.txt|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=2008-03-09|title=1990 CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy of the Soviet Union was the modern world's first centrally [[planned economy]]. It was based on a system of state ownership and managed through [[Gosplan]] (the State Planning Commission), [[Gosbank]] (the State Bank) and [[Gossnab]] (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supply). Economic planning was through a series of [[five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]]. The emphasis was put on rapid development of [[heavy industry]], and the nation became one of the world's top manufacturers of a large number of basic and heavy industrial products, but it lagged behind in the output of [[light industrial]] production and [[consumer durables]].

As the Soviet economy grew more complex, it required more and more complex disaggregation of control figures (plan targets) and factory inputs. As it required more communication between the enterprises and the planning ministries, and as the number of enterprises, trusts, and ministries multiplied, the Soviet economy started stagnating. The Soviet economy was increasingly sluggish when it came to responding to change, adapting cost−saving technologies, and providing incentives at all levels to improve growth, productivity and efficiency.

Most information in the Soviet economy flowed from the top down, and economic planning was often done based on faulty or outdated information, particularly in sectors with large numbers of consumers. As a result, some goods tended to be underproduced, leading to shortages, while other goods were overproduced and accumulated in storage. Some factories developed a system of [[barter]] and either exchanged or shared raw materials and parts, while consumers developed a [[black market]] for goods that were particularly sought after but constantly underproduced.

Conceding the weaknesses of their past approaches in solving new problems, the leaders of the late 1980s, headed by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], were seeking to mold a program of economic reform to galvanise the economy. However, by 1990 the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price [[subsidies]] to continue.

The industrial production system in the Soviet Union suffered a political and economic collapse in 1991, after which a transition from centrally planned to market-driven economies occurred. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economic integration of the Soviet republics was dissolved, and overall industrial activity declined substantially.&lt;ref&gt;Oldfield, J.D. (2000) "Structural economic change and the natural environment in the Russian Federation". ''Post-Communist Economies'', 12(1): 77-90)&lt;/ref&gt; A lasting legacy remains in the physical infrastructure created during decades of combined industrial production practices.

==Sweden==
[[Sweden]]'s industrial sector presents diverging information in production output and industrial employment levels. Using OECD (2008) data, specific statements can be made about these elements. With this data, it can be seen that production output within the industrial sector has been constantly rising. Contrastingly, employment within industry has been steadily declining since the 1970s, as service sector employment rates increase. Though the decline in industrial employment points to a deindustrialising economy, the increasing levels of production output state otherwise.

Sweden's industrial sector remains intact as it relies on its resource base of [[timber]], [[hydropower]], and [[iron ore]] as a large economic contributor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sw.html#top CIA World Factbook 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its increased production rates in industry, it can be ascertained that deindustrialisation has not occurred in Sweden. The decrease in industrial employment has been countered by an increase in efficiency and [[automation]], increasing output levels in the industrial sector.

==Switzerland==
Deindustrialisation is a phenomenon that has been occurring in [[Switzerland]] since the mid-1970s. Civilian employment in industry has been in decline since 1975, according to OECD (2008) data, due to a major recession in the market. Literature (Afonso 2005) has stated that this is due to large numbers of [[migrant worker]]s being forced to leave the country thanks to nonrenewable working permits; the industry, heavily based in foreign labour, suffered greatly and those losses are still observed in the present. Production of total industry has been increasing consistently at a slow rate since a slight decline in 1974.

==United Kingdom==
{{further|Social history of the United Kingdom (1945–present)#Deindustrialization}}
The [[United Kingdom]] has experienced deindustrialisation, especially in both heavy industry (such as mining and steel) and light manufacturing. New jobs have appeared with either low wages, or with high skill requirements that the laid-off workers lack. Meanwhile, the political reverberations have been growing.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Strangleman, James Rhodes, and Sherry Linkon, "Introduction to crumbling cultures: Deindustrialization, class, and memory." ''International Labor and Working-Class History'' 84 (2013): 7-22.

History Compass 11.11 (2013): 994-1007&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK's share of manufacturing output had risen from 9.5% in 1830, during the [[Industrial Revolution]], to 22.9% in the 1870s. It fell to 13.6% by 1913, 10.7% by 1938, and 4.9% by 1973.&lt;ref name="Gat2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Azar Gat|title=War in Human Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6gSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA519|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-923663-3|page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overseas competition, lack of innovation, trade unionism, the welfare state, loss of the [[British Empire]], and cultural attitudes have all been put forward as explanations for the industrial decline.&lt;ref name="Laybourn1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Laybourn|title=Modern Britain Since 1906: A Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJpiVcZbaSEC&amp;pg=PA230|year=1999|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-237-1|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached crisis point in the 1970s, with a worldwide energy crisis, high inflation, and a dramatic influx of low-cost manufactured goods from Asia.

In the [[United States]], deindustrialisation is mostly a regional phenomenon, centred on the [[Rust Belt]] of the original industrial centres from [[New England]] to the [[Great Lakes]]. While many Americans put the timing of industrial crisis as 1979 to 1984, in fact the most massive loss of US manufacturing jobs occurred in the 21st century: one third of US manufacturing jobs disappeared between 2001 and 2009, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES3000000001.

The mainstream of the economics professions argues nonetheless that loss of manufacturing jobs is not a problem for the following reasons: real industrial production rose in the United States in most years from 1983 to 2007.  The argument is then that machines are replacing workers in the sense that more output is being produced by the same number of workers.  In addition, the overall US labour force has increased dramatically, resulting in a massive reduction in the percent of the labour force engaged in industry (from over 35% in the late 1960s to under 20% today).{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Industry (and specifically manufacturing) is thus less prominent in American life and the [[Economy of the United States|American economy]] now than in over a hundred years.

However, the interpretation that manufacturing employment declined as a result of replacing people with machines has not addressed the issue that US non-financial firms seriously dropped their investment in fixed capital as a percent of operating profits between 2001 and 2009 (see NIPA accounts at www.bea.gov). It appears that far from buying robots, US manufacturing firms may be buying fewer machines as well as hiring fewer workers. In general, the literature that argues loss of US manufacturing jobs is inevitable in an advanced capitalist nation does also not grapple with the prominent role of manufacturing in advanced economies such as Germany and Japan, which also tend to have unit labor costs at least as high (if not higher) than those of the United States, per the Conference Board.

In fact, industry does continue in the United States, for example, there are export-competitive producers of precision technology in New England.  Thus, the perception that all industry has left the United States is due to shifting patterns in the geography and political geography of production, away from metropolitan centers (such as New York, Boston, Chicago, Oakland, toward more "rural" areas (such as Georgia or New Hampshire or Utah).  Since most Americans live in large cities, most Americans see empty factories, even if plants are operating well in other locations.  Some argue also that the shift has been (from the heavily unionised [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] towards the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and the high supply of workers (largely immigrant, first-generation, and second-generation) willing to accept low wages in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]), along with increasing labour productivity, which has led to higher levels of output without increases in the total number of workers. Many argue that the [[textile]] industry, was the dominant factor in the industrialisation of New England, and in the 20th century increasingly textile factories were moved to the South. In recent decades the South has also lost its textile firms.&lt;ref&gt;David Koistinen, "Business and Regional Economic Decline: The Political Economy of Deindustrialization in Twentieth-Century New England" [http://www.thebhc.org/sites/default/files/koistinen2.pdf  ''Business and economic history online'' (2014) #12 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet it would be inaccurate to argue that the only sectors to leave New England after 1980 were labor-intensive sector such as shoes and textiles, and there are many non-union firms in New England today.  Rather, even high productivity sectors in which the US might be expected to have a comparative advantage such as machine tool production departed the United States between 1980 and 1985.  This is arguably because the US Federal Reserve advocated for a strong dollar policy, at precisely the moment when German and Japanese manufacturers had falling costs due to rising productivity (post WW II catch-up was complete).  Under the circumstances of falling Japanese prices, for example, only a decline in the value of the US dollar could have kept US machine tools competitive.  The fact that the US Federal Reserve followed precisely the opposite policy and caused the dollar to appreciate 1979 to 1984 was a death blow to New England's machine tools.  In 1986, the Fed recognized its mistake and negotiated the devaluation of the dollar against the Yen and the German Mark with the Plaza Accords, but by then it was too late for many firms, which either closed, laid off hundreds, or were sold to conglomerates during the down periods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/35530846/Deindustrialization_in_the_Granite_State_What_Keene_New_Hampshire_Can_Tell_Us_About_the_Roles_of_Monetary_Policy_and_Financialization_in_the_Loss_of_US_Manufacturing_Jobs Duggan, M.C. 2017] Duggan, MC 2017 "Deindustrialization in the Granite State" in Dollars and Sense, Nov/Dec issue.

Certain sectors of manufacturing remain vibrant. The production of electronic equipment has risen by over 50%, while that of clothing has fallen by over 60%. Following a moderate downturn, industrial production grew slowly but steadily between 2003 and 2007. The sector, however, averaged less than 1% growth annually from 2000 to 2007; from early 2008, moreover, industrial production again declined, and by June 2009, had fallen by over 15% (the sharpest decline since the great depression). Output thereafter began to recover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/ipdisk/ip_sa.txt Federal Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of the United States has nearly doubled since the 1950s, adding approximately 150 million people. Yet, during this period (1950–2007), the proportion of the population living in the great manufacturing cities of the Northeast has declined significantly. During the 1950s, the nation's twenty largest cities held nearly a fifth of the US population. In 2006, this proportion has dropped to about one tenth of the population.&lt;ref name=gcities&gt;Stephen Ohlemacher, "America's big cities are getting smaller",  Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Many small and mid-sized manufacturing cities in the [[Rust Belt]] experience similar fates. For instance, the city of [[Cumberland, Maryland]], declined from a population of 39,483 in the 1940s to a population of 20,915 in 2005. The city of [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], saw its population drop from a peak of 1,849,568 in 1950 to 713,777 in 2010, the largest drop in population of any major city in the U.S. (1,135,971) and the second largest drop in terms of percent of people lost (second only to [[St. Louis, Missouri]]'s 62.7% drop).

One of the first industries to decline was the textile industry in New England, as its factories shifted to the South. Since the 1970s, textiles have also declined in the Southeast. New England responded by developing a high-tech economy, especially in education and medicine, using its very strong educational base.&lt;ref&gt;David Koistinen, ''Confronting Decline: The Political Economy of Deindustrialization in Twentieth-Century New England'' (University Press of Florida; 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Americans migrated away from the manufacturing centres, they formed [[urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs, and many former small cities have grown tremendously in the last 50 years. In 2005 alone, [[Phoenix, Arizona]] has grown by 43,000 people, an increase in population greater than any other city in the United States. Contrast that with the fact that in 1950, Phoenix was only the 99th largest city in the nation with a population of 107,000. In 2005, the population has grown to 1.5 million, ranking as the sixth largest city proper in the US.&lt;ref name=gcities/&gt;

The '''Orthodox Slavs''' form a religious grouping of the [[Slavic peoples]], including ethnic groups and nations that predominantly adhere to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]] faith and whose Churches follow the [[Byzantine Rite]] [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]]. Orthodoxy spread to Eastern Europe in the Early Middle Ages through Byzantine influence, and has been retained in several countries until today.

Orthodox Slavic nations today include the [[Belarusians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins]], [[Russians]], [[Serbs]] and [[Ukrainians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historydoctor.net/Advanced%20Placement%20World%20History/byzantine_religion_and_influence.htm|title=Byzantine Religion and Influence|website=Historydoctor.net|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They inhabit a contiguous area in [[Eastern Europe]] stretching from the northeast in the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] and [[Balkans|Balkan Mountains]] in the southeast and southwest; from the north in the [[Russian Federation]] to the southwest in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] near the Greek border. There are also major Orthodox Slavic population hubs and communities in [[North Asia]] (predominantly [[Siberia]]), the [[Americas]] (predominantly [[North America]]), and significant diaspora groups throughout the rest of the world.

All Orthodox Christian Churches with Slavic-language liturgy, with the exception of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Church]], use the [[Julian calendar]] ("Old Style") exclusively, and all use it to calculate the date [[Easter]] is celebrated.

==States==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2008">'''Economically Backward Class''' (EBCs) in [[India]] is a category of extremely poor people having annual income less than Rs.8.00 lakh and who do not belong to any social category such as SC/ST/[[Other Backward Class|OBC]] . &lt;ref&gt; http://pib.nic.in/newsite/mbErel.aspx?relid=148118 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/maharashtra-government-raises-ebc-limit-to-rs-6-lakh-with-a-rider/articleshow/54840497.cms &lt;/ref&gt;
Economically Backward Class (EBC) refer to economically weaker section in [[India]].

[[Government of India]] runs various schemes for uplift of Economically Backward Class people.
There is a large percentage of Indian population who live below [[poverty line]] and belong to EBC .
The eligibility to get EBC certificate is purely based on annual income and the limit has been set by respective state government in which a person is domiciled.
Economically Backward Class people do not get any kind of reservation in education and jobs by government of India unlike reserved categories. . Many political parties due to vote bank politics are not doing enough to uplift EBC. There is huge unrest among people, this unrest comes out in many ways including the form of anti-reservation agitations.

;EBC certificate for different purposes:
EBC certificates can be used to get free or concessional fees in education and job oriented training courses.

;Schemes for the Economically Backward Classes (EBCs):
Two schemes that are specifically designed for the poorer sections from the General Category are the Post-Matric Scholarship &amp; Interest Subsidy on Educational Loans for Overseas Studies.

There are numerous '''ethnic groups in Burkina Faso'''. The most predominant group are the [[Mossi people|Mossi]], about 40% of the population.  They are mainly farmers and live in the central portions of the country.

The [[Bobo people]], the second largest ethnic group (about one million), are mostly farmers, artisans, and metalworkers living in the southwest around [[Bobo-Dioulasso]].

Other groups include the [[Gurunsi]], [[Senufo people|Senufo]], [[Lobi people|Lobi]], [[Mandé peoples|Mande]], and the semi-nomadic [[Fulani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-fr|Peul}}; {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}&lt;/ref&gt; who inhabit the areas near the country’s northern borders. The number of nomads in the north has diminished since the [[Sahelian]] drought of the 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13145">The''' Hausjärvi Gravel Pit Murders '''were a series of two or more crimes during the 1990s that were connected to [[Gravel pit|gravel pits]] around [[Hausjärvi]] municipality in north of [[Helsinki]] urban area in [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://is.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/uutinen//3457002/Yksi-pakeni-toinen-surmattiin-kolmas-katosi|title=One fled, one was killed, the third disappeared|publisher=Central Uusimaa|date=21 September 2008|accessdate=22 April 2014|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Finland)|National Bureau of Investigation]], the three different events were the doing of a one-person, who has been called the '''Järvenpää Serial Killer'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://keski-uusimaa.fi/Uutiset/Arkisto/2008/07/15/Jarvenpaan-sarjamurhaaja-yrittanyt-ehka-uusia-tekonsa2|title=Järvenpää's serial killer perhaps tried new things|author=Malin Jarkko|publisher=Central Uusimaa|date=15 July 2008|accessdate=22 April 2014|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The crimes ==

=== Abduction of Helena Meriläinen ===
In November 1990, 39-year-old Helena "Hellu" Meriläinen was spending her evening at [[Järvenpää]]. She left her friend at midnight and was about to travel home to [[Riihimäki]]. She walked to the train station and left waiting for the train on the pier, when she was soon followed by a dark-haired man dressed in a leather jacket. The man asked about her travel plans, and she told him that she was expecting to catch a train to Riihimäki. The man offered Meriläinen a ride home, and because she was under the influence of alcohol, she agreed. He then walked her to his car, which Meriläinen later stated in the interrogations was a light-coloured passenger car, not a station wagon, probably an elder Mazda or Datsun.&lt;ref name="haantie"&gt;YLE - Kadonneet: Perjantai 13. päivä&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the trip, the man offered alcoholic beverages and some form of medicine in the form of capsules, to which Meriläinen accepted both. The man himself took several of the capsules during the drive. During the trip, she noticed that the man seemed distressed and that he had a child seat at the back. She fell asleep, and when she woke up, Meriläinen noticed that the car was not on the road to Riihimäki, but on a remote forest path. When she asked the man about the route, he assured her that he was still on the right way.

The man drove the car to a dark gravel pit and stopped the car. He tried to persuade Meriläinen to stay in the car for a night, but she refused and said that she wanted to go home. At that point, the man said that he needed to go urinate and left the car, with Meriläinen feeling the same need and also leaving the car. When Meriläinen squatted, the man quickly approached and struck her to head with the edge of a knife. Despite the injury, Meriläinen managed to flee towards the forest.

She heard the man say "I did not succeed this time". When she started running, the man spoke something to himself and entered his car. After a while, Meriläinen found a road to a house and alerted them for help. An ambulance was called, and she got away with minor physical injuries. She was apparently saved by a thick woollen knit cap.

=== Tuula Lukkarinen ===
In April 1991, 28-year-old Tuula Lukkarinen left [[Kellokoski]] psychiatric hospital on vacation, with the purpose of travelling to [[Hyrylä]] for a custody case for her son. However, she never made it to Hyrylä, and was last seen in Järvenpää waiting on a liquor store to open before ten o'clock am. 

The next day, a landowner discovered her badly mutilated body in the woods near a gravel pit, the body being less than 100 metres away from the place where, a five months earlier, Meriläinen was attacked. According to police, Lukkarinen was transported to Hausjärvi between the day of disappearance and the day of discovery and the time of death had been around midnight. The body had been dragged a few dozen meters to the woods from a small road that led to the gravel pits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000003061088.html|title=A woman on a vacation from a hospital, found murdered in Hausjärvi.|author=J KUPARINEN|publisher=Helsingin Sanomat|date=20 April 1991|accessdate=18 October 2018|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A blizzard had hit the area during the hours after her death and caused damage to the crime scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.is.fi/kotimaa/art-2000000933115.html|title=Who hunted dark-haired women? National Bureau of Investigation is re-investigating the strange murder mystery|author=Sari Autio, Marko Sorsa|publisher=Ilta-Sanomat|date=28 May 2015|accessdate=18 October 2018|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to police Lukkarinen was not raped.

=== Maarit Haantie ===
40-year-old Maarit Haantie disappeared in August 1993, and is also suspected of being the victim of a possible [[serial killer]]. Her body was searched for by the local authorities to no avail. The NBI began investigating the cases of the three women as the doing of one killer, arguing that many factors, such as the use of alcohol, the dark hair color and being in the same area contributed to the theory. According to NBI they also have information that connects the disappearance to the two earlier cases that they won't publish due to an open investigation.&lt;ref name="Jarkko Malin"&gt;Malin, Jarkko: Police still believes they can find the Hikiä serial killer Aamuposti, 16.07.2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== Disappearance ====
Haantie was attending a party at the restaurant Zapata in Järvenpää on August 13, 1993. She was going there with her partner and a few friends. All of them got in the restaurant except Haantie. Haantie was not let in by the doorman because of her drunkenness. She was last seen standing outside the building, and hasn't been seen since.

==== Investigation ====
The disappearance of Haantie was initially filed to the Riihimäki Police, who treated the case as a normal disappearance without any indication of homicide. Soon, however, it was discovered that a bag belonging to Haantie had been found in a restaurant called Martina at the town of [[Hyvinkää]]. During interviews with the staff, it was apparent that the employees had removed a drunk person who resembled Maarit Haantie. 

It soon became clear that in 1991, a woman by the name of Tuula Lukkarinen had been found brutally murdered in a Hausjärvi gravel pit. Earlier, in 1990, Helena Meriläinen was attacked in the same area where Lukkarinen's body was discovered five months later. Helena had been hit with a knife, but managed to escape. The police assumed that Meriläinen had been attacked by the same man who had killed Tuula Lukkarinen.

The whole chain of events mentioned above drew the attention of the NBI, and soon the case of Haantie was included in the investigation. A large search was carried out in the woods around the Hausjärvi municipality and especially the gravel pits area south of Hikiä village, but nothing was found. The investigation, however, has remained active to this day. In 2007, the television series "''Kadonneet''", "''Disappeared''" did an episode on Haantie's case, which attracted a lot of attention. In the section, the NBI specifically asked for a hint about a dark-haired man in Järvenpää in the early 90s who offered rides to women, as described by Helena Meriläinen. 

Tuula Lukkarinen, Helena Meriläinen and Maarit Haantie were combined the [[Drinking culture|use of alcohol]], dark hair and living environment, with the NBI believing that the same perpetrator is responsible for all three cases. The ''Kadonneet ''episode gathered about 30 new tips, which helped with the offender's [[Offender profiling|profiling]]. 

According to the NBI, the hints have been very important for the investigation, and have confirmed the results of earlier profiling. Investigation is still active, and the Bureau strongly believes that there have been other murder attempts.

The NBI has searched for Haantie from the forrest areas in Hausjärvi as late as in 2017, claiming that they have information that connects Haantie to the area.&lt;ref name=Helsinginuutiset&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.helsinginuutiset.fi/artikkeli/515489-vuosien-1990-1993-sarjamurhamysteerissa-uusi-johtolanka-krp-tekee-kaivauksia|title=new lead in the 1990-1993 serial killer mystery, NBI doing excavations|publisher=Helsinginuutiset|date=3 May 2017|accessdate=17 October 2018|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarkko Malin"&gt;Malin, Jarkko: Police still believes they can find the Hikiä serial killer Aamuposti, 16.07.2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fourth case ===
In 2017 it was published in the media that there had been a possible fourth case involving the murders. In 1989 a 30-year-old drunken woman had just exited a restaurant in Järvenpää when a man offered her a ride, offering her alcohol and pills and then driving her to a nearby forest, the case resembling the case of Helena Meriläinen's. Although the woman did make it, the victim's mother brought it up after the woman had died of natural causes years later.&lt;ref name="mtvuutiset"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/rikos/artikkeli/krp-hausjarven-selvittamattomiin-hiekkakuoppasurmiin-liittyy-neljaskin-tapaus/6378152|title=NBI: There are four cases of Hausjärvi's unexplained gravel pit attacks|publisher=MTV News|date=4 June 2016|accessdate=6 June 2018|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Similar unsolved cases in the area ===
In year 1988 there were several cases of a man with a similar description and driving a white [[Volkswagen Passat]] liftback harassing women in the areas close by and even attempting to abduct a 19 year old woman in [[Hämeenlinna]] by threatening her with a pistol while the woman was able to escape from a moving car.&lt;ref name="Nykyposti"&gt;Nykyposti 1/89, january 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

In the december of 1987 a 19 year old woman Heidi Härö went missing in [[Mäntsälä]] after leaving a local bar and hitching a ride. Her decomposed body was found five months later from a forrest area in [[Pukkila]] with some of her clothes missing.&lt;ref name="HS"&gt;Kadonnut nainen löytyi kuolleena Pukkilassa/Missing woman found dead in Pukkila Helsingin Sanomat, 03.05.1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Offender's profile ==
Over the years, the perpetrator has been profiled largely based on Meriläinen's story and events, with the description as following:

* At the time of the events in 1990, the man was between 30 and 40 years old, and had a dark, curly hair.
* He is about 1,70 cms tall. 
* He knows the anatomy of a human or a large animal (according to the Lukkarinen murder).
* He possibly had an infant child at the time, as the car's back seat had a child restraint.
* The car itself is thought to be a [[Sedan (automobile)|Sedan]] Mazda or Datsun.
* He was familiar with the towns of Järvenpää, Hyvinkää and Riihimäki that locate along the railway and with the forrest area around the Hikiä village.&lt;ref name=Helsinginuutiset&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.helsinginuutiset.fi/artikkeli/515489-vuosien-1990-1993-sarjamurhamysteerissa-uusi-johtolanka-krp-tekee-kaivauksia|title=new lead in the 1990-1993 serial killer mystery, NBI doing excavations|publisher=Helsinginuutiset|date=3 May 2017|accessdate=17 October 2018|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is believed that he is unable to form a normal relationship with a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2011060213814787_uu.shtml|title=Will the serial killer finally be caught?|publisher=Iltalehti|date=2 June 2011|accessdate=14 October 2018|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The man had spoken about his child and told he had a bad relationship with his wife, and is believed that he might have divorced.

A lot of new tips about the killer have been provided due to the ''Kadonneet ''episode. According to some, a dark-haired man is believed to have offered rides to a few women still in the 21st century. According to the tips a man fitting to the description has last been offering a ride to a woman in year 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/rikos/artikkeli/poliisi-hyvin-toiveikas-jarvenpaan-henkirikosjutussa/2062014#gs.L=s3sqE|title=Police is very hopeful in Järvenpää homicide case|publisher=Mtv3|date=18 July 2008|accessdate=17 October 2018|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBI is still investigating the case, believing that the killer can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.keski-uusimaa.fi/Uutiset/Kaikki-uutiset/Poliisille-tullut-uusia-vihjeita-Jarvenpaan-sarjamurhaajasta|title=News about Järvenpää's serial killer|publisher=Central Uusimaa|date=27 August 2010|accessdate=27 August 2010|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also taken into account that the killer hasn't been found yet because he might be living abroad or is dead.

}}'''Indians in Luxembourg''' form a small minority in the country. As of 2007, there are about 30000 people of Indian origin living in [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_indian-spirit-spices-up-luxembourg_1075694- Indian spirit spices up Luxembourg]", ''Daily News and Analysis'', 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
Since the 1980s, Indians have been coming to Luxembourg due to the growth of the IT industry in the country and the fact that the Indian company [[ArcelorMittal]] has its head office there. Today, there are about 200 Indian families living in the Grand Duchy. Most of the Indians in Luxembourg today are working in the financial sector or are into hotel management.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wort.lu/wort/web/en/culture/articles/2011/11/167654/index.php- Indian Association of Luxembourg turns 20 - India's friendly face in Luxembourg]", ''wort.lu'', 15 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/life/2007/02/02/stories/2007020200200200.htm- Indian Association of Luxembourg turns 20 - Global grand duchy]", ''The Hindu Business Line'', 2 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language and religion==
Indians in Luxembourg speak Indian languages such as [[Hindi]], [[Tamil Language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu Language|Telugu]] as well as local languages like [[German language|German]], [[French Language|French]] and [[Luxembourgish Language|Luxembourgish]]. [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] are practiced by the Indian community and festivals such as [[Diwali]], [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]] and [[Christmas]] are celebrated.

==Organizations==
The Indian Association of Luxembourg was formed in 1991 by a businessman, Ambi Venkataraman. The association was born with the help of 13 founding members and it also serves an educational role in ensuring that children with Indian heritage understand their cultural history, including the religious festivals. In November 2011, the Indian Association of Luxembourg celebrated its 20th anniversary.

He is the author of ''Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America'', published in 2017 and a winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction]], and a co-founder of the Maya Angelou School in [[Washington, D.C.]]

== Early life ==
Forman is the son of [[James Forman|James Forman Sr.]] and Constancia Romilly, who met through their activism and involvement with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]].&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/07/17/537715793/how-black-leaders-unwittingly-contributed-to-the-era-of-mass-incarceration|title=How Black Leaders Unwittingly Contributed To The Era Of Mass Incarceration|last=Gross|first=Terry|date=2017-07-17|website=NPR|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forman Sr. was the group's executive secretary handling internal operations&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America|last=Forman Jr.|first=James|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2017|isbn=9780374189976|location=New York|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1961 to 1966 and active during the [[Freedom Summer|1964 Freedom Summer]].&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; Romilly, daughter of the British journalist and aristocrat [[Jessica Mitford]],&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; dropped out of [[Sarah Lawrence College]] to join the group in 1962 and would eventually become a coordinator of SNCC's Atlanta chapter.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Forman has a brother, Chaka Forman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0803/forman.html|title=James Forman, Activist: Children Donate Civil Rights Leader's Papers|last=Dalrymple|first=Helen|last2=Fineberg|first2=Gail|date=March 2008|website=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forman Sr. and Romilly divorced in the early 1970s when Forman was seven years old.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; Forman speculated in an interview that FBI pressure on civil rights groups at the time contributed to the strain on his parents' marriage:&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; "There was also the period when...the FBI was putting incredible pressure on civil rights groups through the [[COINTELPRO|counter-intelligence program]] -- or the COINTELPRO program. And they were fomenting lies and distrust... They [Forman Sr. and Romilly] had a hard time in those years for a lot of reasons but I know, for my mom in particular, that that was one."&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

After his parents' divorce, Forman and his brother lived with Romilly in [[New York City|New York]] but spent summers and holidays with Forman Sr., and Forman has stated that both parents were active in his life.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

Forman was accepted into an elite New York high school: [[Hunter College High School]].&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; The school was almost all white, prompting Romilly to move with her sons to [[Atlanta]] so they could grow up in a black community, which she considered important for their racial identities.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; Forman expressed the importance of this move in an interview, saying: "In a city that has so many African-American people, I would go to school, and the jocks were black. The nerds were black... The artsy kids were black. The band-camp kids were black. The thugs were black -- like, everybody was black. So there wasn't a way to perform that went along with being black. And that, I think, was very powerful and liberating for me as a child because it meant I got to be who I was, which was a nerdy kid. And nobody thought, oh, well, you're not black if you're reading books."&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

Forman attended Roosevelt High School in Atlanta.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.yale.edu/james-forman-jr|title=James Forman Jr.|website=Yale Law School|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to attend [[Brown University]], from which he received his Bachelor of Arts in 1988.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/04/18/524569143/locking-up-our-own-details-the-mass-incarceration-of-black-men|title="Locking Up Our Own" Details the Mass Incarceration of Black Men|last=Siegal|first=Robert|date=2017-04-18|website=NPR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a Doctor of Law degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Law career ==

=== Law Clerk ===
In the 1990s, right after graduating law school, Forman began work as a law clerk for [[William Albert Norris|William Norris]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; The next year he clerked for [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]].&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

Forman describes working with O'Connor as enjoyable, although they disagreed on many of the social issues that came before the court.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; In his interview for the job, Forman was asked how his differing political viewpoints would affect his work as a law clerk.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; In an interview, he stated his response: "I told her that I will argue with you. I'll tell you the truth about what I think. I will try to persuade you. But at the end of the day, you are the justice, and I'm the law clerk. And if I'm taking this job, I'm agreeing to help you do your work, right? I'm helping -- if you decide to come out the other way and assign me the opinion, then I'll write the best opinion I can for you."&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

=== Public Defender ===
During his stint as her law clerk, Forman was encouraged by O'Connor to pursue a career in the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] or with a civil rights organization such as the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|NAACP]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America|last=Forman Jr.|first=James|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2017|isbn=9780374189976|location=New York|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He instead opted to become a [[Public defender (United States)|public defender]], saying in an interview, "I imagined myself doing the civil rights work of my generation."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Forman became a public defender in Washington, D.C. in the fall of 1994, a job he would hold for six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America|last=Forman Jr.|first=James|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2017|isbn=9780374189976|location=New York|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote about some of his experiences with clients in ''Locking Up Our Own.''

=== Teaching ===
In 2003, Forman began teaching law at [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He remained at Georgetown until 2011, when he joined the faculty at [[Yale University|Yale]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There he teaches [[Constitutional law|Constitutional Law]] and seminars entitled Race, Class and Punishment and another entitled Inside Out: Issues in Criminal Justice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== The Maya Angelou School ==
In 1997, Forman cofounded with [http://www.echoinggreen.org/fellows/david-domenici David Domenici] as part of the [http://www.seeforever.org See Forever Foundation], a comprehensive educational program for teens, which later became the [http://www.seeforever.org/maya-angelou-public-charter-schools/high-school/ Maya Angelou Public Charter School].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America|last=Forman, Jr.|first=James|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2017|isbn=9780374189976|location=New York|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domenici, a [[Stanford Law School|Stanford Law]] graduate and former corporate attorney first pitched his idea for the school to Forman in a D.C. coffee shop in 1995, and they began planning in earnest soon after.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The school was designed to reach troubled children and provide them high-quality education, counseling services, and employment opportunities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Forman thought the program could be incredibly beneficial to some of his clients as a public defender; he wrote in his book: "Most of my clients had struggled in school or dropped out altogether before they were arrested. If a program like [this one] had existed…they might never have become my clients in the first place."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America|last=Forman, Jr.|first=James|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2017|isbn=9780374189976|location=New York|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Forman took a leave of absence from public defense work to pursue opening the Maya Angelou School.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In the fall, with some grant money and teachers hired on, the Maya Angelou Public Charter High School opened with twenty students selected from the court system,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; all of them either on probation or committed to the Department of Youth and Rehabilitation Services.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seeforever.org/the-maya-way/our-beginnings/|title=Our Beginnings|last=|first=|date=|website=See Forever Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students had poor academic records and had often experienced trauma or struggled with mental health.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America|last=Forman, Jr.|first=James|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2017|isbn=9780374189976|location=New York|pages=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Forman writes in ''Locking Up Our Own'' about ongoing struggles with local police targeting students of the school for searches and arrests.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Despite these difficulties, the school was successful. By September 2004, the Maya Angelou Public Charter High School had grown significantly and opened a second campus location in partnership with the [[District of Columbia Public Schools]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In the summer of 2007, the Maya Angelou School took over the school inside Oak Hill Detention Center, Washington D.C.'s juvenile prison.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The changes enacted by the Maya Angelou School inside the prison were described by a court monitor as contributing to an "extraordinary" turnaround.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The same year, the Transition Center was also opened to help young people transition from incarceration by helping them get GEDs and workplace credentials.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Today the Maya Angelou School system includes the Maya Angelou Public Charter High School, the Maya Angelou Young Adult Learning Center (the Transition Center), and the Maya Angelou Academy at New Beginnings.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The Maya Angelou School's mission statement, described as "the Maya Way" on the school's website, is to provide "a comprehensive approach to education that focuses on academic achievement, social and emotional support, and career and college preparation so students are ready for life after Maya."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seeforever.org/the-maya-way/sample-page/|title=Mission|last=|first=|date=|website=See Forever Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's name was chosen in a contest from an essay written by Sherti Hendrix, a member of the class of 1999, the school's first graduating class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seeforever.org/the-maya-way/our-namesake/|title=Our Namesake|last=|first=|date=|website=See Forever Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==
Forman was part of the 1999 documentary ''Innocent Until Proven Guilty'', which focused on his work as a public defender and with the See Forever Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emro.lib.buffalo.edu/emro/emroDetail.asp?Number=510|title=Innocent Until Proven Guilty: James Forman, Jr., Public Defender|last=Bell-Russel|first=Danna|date=|website=Educational Movie Reviews Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forman has contributed writing about topics such as police brutality, mass incarceration, and the criminal justice system to ''[[The Atlantic]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''.

In April 2017, Forman published his first book, ''Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/books/review-locking-up-our-own-james-forman-jr.html|title="Locking Up Our Own," What Lead to the Mass Incarceration of Black Men|last=Senior|first=Jennifer|date=2017-04-11|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book examines tough on crime policies that were supported in many black communities in the 1970s but are now contributing to mass incarceration. In an interview, Forman stated about the issues addressed in the book: "When we think about our criminal justice system, I don't think we can imagine choices in isolation... And so what I'm trying to argue in the book is that we have to look at this system as a whole, and we have to look at all of its dysfunctions. And only until we do that will we really understand the damage that it's doing to people's lives. Sometimes, some people even say we need more prisons. But they also say, we need more job training. We need more housing. We need better schools. We need funding for drug treatment, for mental health treatment. We need a national gun control policy. We need a Marshall Plan for urban America. We need the federal government to do for black communities what is did for Europe after World War II -- to rebuild, to reinvest, to revitalize. That's the claim. But instead of all of the above, the black community, historically, has gotten one of the above. And the one of the above is law enforcement."&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

''Locking Up Our Own'' was included on accolade lists such as the ''Publishers Weekly'' Best Books of 2017, the ''New York Times Book Review'' Editors' Choice, the ''GQ'' Book of the Year as well was the longlist for the National Book Awards and the shortlist for the Inaugural Goddard Riverside Stephan Russo Book Prize for Social Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://us.macmillan.com/lockingupourown/jamesformanjr/9780374189976/|title=Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America|last=|first=|date=|website=Macmillan Publishers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Last Tango in Paris''''' ({{lang-it|Ultimo tango a Parigi}}) is a 1972 Italian-French [[sex in film|erotic]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] which portrays a recently widowed American who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young Parisian woman. It stars [[Marlon Brando]], [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]], and [[Jean-Pierre Léaud]].

The film's raw portrayal of sexual violence and emotional turmoil led to international controversy and drew various levels of government censorship in different venues. Upon release in the United States, the most graphic scene was cut and the [[MPAA]] gave the film an [[X rating]]. After revisions were made to the MPAA ratings code, in 1997 the film was re-classified [[NC-17]] for "some explicit sexual content". [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] released a censored [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] cut in 1981.

== Plot ==
Paul ([[Marlon Brando]]), a middle-aged American hotel owner mourning his wife's suicide, meets a young, engaged Parisian woman named Jeanne ([[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]]) at an apartment that both are interested in renting. Paul takes the apartment after they begin an anonymous [[sexual relationship]] there. He insists that neither of them must share any personal information, even given names. The affair continues until one day, Jeanne arrives at the apartment and finds that Paul has packed up and left without warning.

Paul later meets Jeanne on the street and says he wants to renew the relationship. He tells her of the recent tragedy of his wife. As he tells his life story, they walk into a [[tango (music)|tango]] bar, where he continues telling her about himself. The loss of anonymity disillusions Jeanne about their relationship. She tells Paul she does not want to see him again. Paul, not wanting to let Jeanne go, chases her back to her apartment, where he tells her he loves her and wants to know her name.

Jeanne takes a gun from a drawer. She tells Paul her name and shoots him. Paul staggers out onto the balcony, mortally wounded, and collapses. As Paul dies, a dazed Jeanne mutters to herself that he was just a stranger who tried to rape her and she did not know who he was, as if in a rehearsal, preparing herself for questioning by the police.

== Production ==
[[File:Bir-Hakeim-1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Pont de Bir-Hakeim]] in Paris, where numerous scenes were shot.]]
[[Bernardo Bertolucci]] developed the film from his sexual fantasies: "He once dreamed of seeing a beautiful nameless woman on the street and having sex with her without ever knowing who she was".&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Sophie |date=4 February 2011 |title=Last Tango in Paris star Maria Schneider dies at 58 |url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/entertainment/8061/last-tango-paris-star-maria-schneider-dies-58 |newspaper=[[The Week]] |access-date=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay was by Bertolucci, [[Franco Arcalli]], and [[Agnès Varda]] (additional dialogue). It was later adapted as a novel by Robert Alley. The film was directed by Bertolucci with cinematography by [[Vittorio Storaro]].

Bertolucci originally intended to cast [[Dominique Sanda]], who developed the idea with him, and [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]]. Trintignant refused and, when Brando accepted, Sanda was pregnant and decided not to do the film.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

An art lover, Bertolucci drew inspiration from the works of the Irish-born British artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] for the opening sequence of cast and crew credits.&lt;ref&gt;"A celebration of 500 years of British Art". ''Life: The Observer Magazine'', 19 March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; According to American artist [[Andy Warhol]], the ''Last Tango'' film was based on Warhol's own ''[[Blue Movie]]'' film released a few years earlier in 1969.&lt;ref name="WS-2002-2005"&gt;{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=Blue Movie (1968) |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |date=2005 |work=WarholStars.org |access-date=December 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the film's release, criminal proceedings were brought in Italy against the film for "esasperato pansessualismo fine a se stesso"("aggravated, gratuitous pansexualism"). The final judgment of the Court of Appeal (Cassazione) delivered on 29 January 1976 ordered that the film be seized by the censorship commission and that all copies be destroyed. Scriptwriter Franco Arcalli, producer Alberto Grimaldi, director Bernardo Bertolucci, and Marlon Brando were each given suspended sentences of two months imprisonment.

===Rape scene===

The film contains a scene in which Brando's character [[anal rape|anally rapes]] Schneider's character using butter as a lubricant.
In a 2006 interview, Schneider said that the scene was not in the script and that "when they told me, I had a burst of anger. Woo! I threw everything. And nobody can force someone to do something not in the script. But I didn't know that. I was too young".&lt;ref name="Downhill Ride"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/downhill-ride-for-maria-after-her-tango-with-brando/2006/06/21/1150845244689.html |title=Downhill ride for Maria after her tango with Brando |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=Fairfax Media|location=Sydney, Australia|date=22 June 2006 |accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, Schneider recounted feelings of sexual humiliation pertaining to the rape scene:
{{quote|They only told me about it before we had to film the scene and I was so angry. I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can't force someone to do something that isn't in the script, but at the time, I didn't know that. Marlon said to me: 'Maria, don't worry, it's just a movie', but during the scene, even though what Marlon was doing wasn't real, I was crying real tears. I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci. After the scene, Marlon didn't console me or apologise. Thankfully, there was just one take.&lt;ref name="DailyMail"&gt;{{cite news |first=Lina |last=Das|title=I felt raped by Brando  |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-469646/I-felt-raped-Brando.html |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Daily Mail and General Trust]]|location=London, England|date=19 July 2007 |access-date=21 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schneider also said that she considers Bertolucci a "gangster and a pimp".&lt;ref name="Stealing Beauty"&gt;{{cite news|first=Xan|last=Brooks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/feb/05/features.xanbrooks|title=Stealing Beauty|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London, England|date=5 February 2004|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Bertolucci denied that he "stole her youth" (she was 19 at the time of filming), and commented, "The girl wasn't mature enough to understand what was going on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Dollar|url=http://daily.greencine.com/archives/007965.html|title=Interview: Bernardo Bertolucci|website=Green Cine|date=January 2, 2011|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105081412/http://daily.greencine.com/archives/007965.html |archive-date=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneider remained friends with Brando until his death in 2004, but never made up with Bertolucci. She also claimed that Brando and Bertolucci "made a fortune" from the film while she made very little money.&lt;ref name="DailyMail"/&gt;

Schneider died in 2011. In February 2013, Bertolucci spoke about the film's effect on Schneider on the Dutch television show ''[[College Tour]]''. In the interview, Bertolucci clarified that although the rape scene was in the script, the detail of using butter as a lubricant was improvised the day of shooting and Schneider did not know about the use of the butter beforehand. Bertolucci said that "I feel guilty, but I don't regret it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://collegetour.ntr.nl/page/detail/790329 "Bernardo Bertolucci"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220150719/http://collegetour.ntr.nl/page/detail/790329 |date=20 December 2016 }}, ''Dutch College Tour'', NTR, 2 February 2013,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl4xCGcdfA |title=Bertolucci over Maria Schneider |publisher=College Tour |date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, Bertolucci spoke again about the scene at a retrospective at the [[Cinémathèque Française]], claiming that the scene was in the script but the use of butter was not. Bertolucci said that he and Brando "decided not to say anything to Maria to get a more realistic response".&lt;ref name=ansa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/spettacolo/2013/09/17/Bertolucci-confessione-shock_9312378.html |title=Bertolucci, confessione shock su Ultimo tango |work=ANSA |language=Italian |date=17 September 2013 |accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, a slightly different version of the 2013 ''College Tour'' interview was uploaded to [[YouTube]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=021jNOEVytQ|title=Bertolucci sobre Maria Schneider / Bertolucci admits rape scene was non-consensual|first=|last=|date=23 November 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Spanish nonprofit ''El Mundo de Alycia'' on the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].&lt;ref name=izadi&gt;{{cite web |first=Elahe|last=Izadi |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/12/05/why-the-last-tango-in-paris-rape-scene-is-generating-such-an-outcry-now/ |title=Why the 'Last Tango in Paris' rape scene is generating such an outcry now |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington DC|date=5 December 2016 |accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; accompanied by a statement concluding that the scene "abused [Schneider] psychologically and, who knows if also, physically..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elmundodealycia.org/bertolucci-confiesa-la-violacion-de-maria-schneider/ |title=Bertolucci confiesa la violación de Maria Schneider |work=El Mundo de Alycia |language=Spanish |date=25 November 2016 |accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gained attention when ''[[Yahoo!

Bertolucci also shot a scene which showed Brando's genitals, but in 1973 explained, "I had so identified myself with Brando that I cut it out of shame for myself. To show him naked would have been like showing me naked."&lt;ref name="The Hottest Movie"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Charles|last=Michener|title=Tango: The Hottest Movie|magazine=[[Newsweek]]|publisher=[[Newsweek Media Group]]|location=New York City|date=February 12, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneider declared in an interview that "Marlon said he felt raped and manipulated by it and he was 48. And he was Marlon Brando!".&lt;ref name="The Hottest Movie"/&gt; Like Schneider, Brando confirmed that the sex was simulated.&lt;ref name=izadi/&gt;
Bertolucci said about Brando that he was "a monster as an actor and a darling as a human being". Brando refused to speak to Bertolucci for 15 years after the production was completed.

{{quote|I was thinking that it was like a dialogue where he was really answering my questions in a way. When at the end of the movie, when he saw it, I discovered that he realized what we were doing, that he was delivering so much of his own experience. And he was very upset with me, and I told him, "Listen, you are a grown-up. Older than me. Didn't you realize what you were doing?" And he didn't talk to me for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brad|last=Balfour|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-balfour/legendary-oscar-winning-b_b_803322.html|title= Legendary Oscar-Winner Bernardo Bertolucci's Career Celebrated at MoMA|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[Huffington Post Media Group]]|location=New York City|date=January 2, 2011|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/revisiting-bernardo-bertoluccis-artistic-ambitions-and-abuses-in-last-tango-in-paris&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Francis Bacon influence ===
[[File:FrancisBacon-StudyforPortraitofIsabelRawsthorne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Double Portrait of Lucian Freud and Frank Auerbach'' (left side, oil on canvas, 1964)]] [[File:FrancisBacon-PortraitofIsabelRawsthorne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Study for a Portrait of Isabel Rawsthorne'' (oil on canvas, 1964)]]
The film's opening credits include two paintings by [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]: ''Double Portrait of [[Lucian Freud]] and [[Frank Auerbach]]'' and ''Study for a Portrait of Isabel Rawsthorne''. The hues used in the film were inspired by the paintings of Bacon.{{sfn|Tonetti|1995|p=233}} During pre-production, Bertolucci frequently visited an exhibit of Bacon's paintings at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris; he said that the light and colour in Bacon's paintings reminded him of Paris in the winter, when
&lt;blockquote&gt;the lights of the stores are on, and there is a very beautiful contrast between the leaden gray of the wintry sky and the warmth of the show windows...the light in the paintings was the major source of inspiration for the style we were looking for.{{sfn|Tonetti|1995|p=126}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Bacon's painting style often depicted human skin like raw meat and the painter's inspiration included meat hanging in a butcher shops window and human skin diseases.{{sfn|Tonetti|1995|p=126}}

Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro had previously worked with Bertolucci on ''[[The Conformist (film)|The Conformist]]'' and often used an azure hue in the film. Storaro later told a reporter that

&lt;blockquote&gt;after ''The Conformist'' I had a moment of crisis; I was asking myself: what can come after azure?...I did not have the slightest idea that an orange film could be born. We needed another kind of emotion...It was the case of ''Last Tango''.{{sfn|Tonetti|1995|p=126}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For ''Last Tango in Paris'', Bertolucci and Storaro took inspiration from Bacon's paintings by using "rich oranges, light and cool grays, icy whites, and occasional reds combine[d] with Bertolucci's own tasteful choices of soft browns, blond browns, and delicate whites with bluish and pink shadings".{{sfn|Tonetti|1995|p=127}}

Bertolucci took Marlon Brando to the Bacon exhibit and told Brando that he "wanted him to compare himself with Bacon's human figures because I felt that, like them, Marlon's face and body were characterized by a strange and infernal plasticity. I wanted Paul to be like the figures that obsessively return in Bacon: faces eaten by something coming from the inside."{{sfn|Tonetti|1995|p=126}}

=== Brando's lines ===
As was his practice in previous films, Brando refused to memorise his lines for many of the scenes. Instead he wrote his lines on [[cue cards]] and posted them around the set, leaving Bertolucci with the problem of keeping them out of the picture frame. During his long monologue over the body of his wife, for example, Brando's dramatic lifting of his eyes upward is not spontaneous dramatic acting but a search for his next cue card.&lt;ref name="SelfPortrait"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903717,00.html|title=Self-Portrait of an Angel and Monster|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=January 22, 1973|accessdate=July 29, 2018|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brando asked Bertolucci if he could "write lines on Maria's rear end", which the director rejected.&lt;ref name="The Hottest Movie"/&gt;

''Last Tango in Paris'' was edited by [[Franco Arcalli]] and [[Roberto Perpignani]].

== Reception ==

The film opened in late 1972 in France, where filmgoers stood in two-hour queues for the first month of its run at the seven cinemas where it was screened.&lt;ref name="SelfPortrait"/&gt; It gained unanimous positive reviews in every major French publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Last Tango' Wins Raves in France |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York City |date= December 16, 1972|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; To circumvent state censorship, thousands of Spaniards travelled hundreds of kilometers to reach French cinemas in [[Biarritz]] and [[Perpignan]] where ''Tango'' was playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Henry |last=Giniger |title= Spaniards Seeing 'Tango' in France |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 16, 1973 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that, it was released in the United States, Great Britain, and other venues.

The film generated considerable controversy because of its subject and graphic portrayal of sex. Schneider provided frank interviews in the wake of ''Tango''{{'}}s controversy, claiming she had slept with 50 men and 70 women, that she was "[[bisexual]] completely", and that she had used [[heroin]], [[cocaine]], and [[marijuana]]. She also said of Bertolucci, "He's quite clever and more free and very young. Everybody was digging what he was doing, and we were all very close."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Judy|last=Klemesrud|title=Maria Says her 'Tango' is Not|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=February 4, 1973|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the publicity for the film's release, Bertolucci said Schneider developed an "[[Oedipus complex|Oedipal fixation]] with Brando".&lt;ref name="The Hottest Movie"/&gt; Schneider said Brando sent her flowers after they first met, and "from then on he was like a daddy".&lt;ref name="SelfPortrait"/&gt; In a later interview, Schneider denied this, saying, "Brando tried to be very paternalistic with me, but it really wasn't any father-daughter relationship."&lt;ref name="The Hottest Movie"/&gt; However, in 2007 she said that "for me, he was more like a father figure and I a daughter."&lt;ref name="DailyMail"/&gt;

=== Response in United States ===

{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF|align=right|width=25%|quote=October 14, 1972... should become a landmark in movie history comparable to May 29, 1913—the night ''[[The Rite of Spring|Le Sacre du Printemps]]'' was first performed—in music history...  ''Last Tango in Paris'' has the same kind of hypnotic excitement as the ''Sacre'', the same primitive force, and the same thrusting, jabbing eroticism.  The movie breakthrough has finally come. — [[Pauline Kael]]{{sfn|Arcalli|Bertolucci|1972|p=9}} }}

The film premiered in New York City on 14 October 1972, to enormous public controversy, as it had received coverage after opening in France. The media frenzy surrounding the film generated intense popular interest as well as moral condemnation, and the film was featured in cover stories in both ''Time'' and ''Newsweek''&lt;ref name="The Hottest Movie"/&gt; magazines. ''Playboy'' published a photo spread of Brando and Schneider "cavorting in the nude".&lt;ref name="The Hottest Movie"/&gt; ''Time'' wrote,

The ''[[Village Voice]]'' reported walkouts by board members and "vomiting by well-dressed wives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Geoffrey|last=Macnab|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/last-tango-in-paris-can-it-arouse-the-same-passions-now-454083.html|title=Last Tango in Paris: Can it arouse the same passions now?|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|date=22 June 2007|accessdate=22 March 2018|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311220122/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/last-tango-in-paris-can-it-arouse-the-same-passions-now-454083.html|archivedate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist [[William F.

After local government officials failed to ban the film in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], theatergoers had to push through a mob of 200 outraged residents, who hurled epithets like "perverts" and "homos" at the attendees.

[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the film's sexual content as the artistic expression of the "era of [[Norman Mailer]] and [[Germaine Greer]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Vincent|last=Canby|authorlink=Vincent Canby|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/02/archives/screen-last-tango-in-paris-at-last-the-cast.html|title=Last Tango in Paris|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=February 2, 1973|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Pauline Kael]] endorsed the film, writing that "''Tango'' has altered the face of an art form. This is a movie people will be arguing about for as long as there are movies."&lt;ref name="SelfPortrait"/&gt; She called it "the most powerfully erotic movie ever made, and it may turn out to be the most liberating movie ever made."{{sfn|Arcalli|Bertolucci|1972|p=10}} [[United Artists]] reprinted the whole of Kael's rave as a double-page advertisement in the Sunday ''New York Times''.

American director [[Robert Altman]] expressed unqualified praise: "I walked out of the screening and said to myself, 'How dare I make another film?' My personal and artistic life will never be the same."&lt;ref name="The Hottest Movie" /&gt; Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively collected 31 reviews and gave the film an approval rating of 80%, with an average rating of 7.9/10.

=== International response ===

[[British Board of Film Classification|British censors]] reduced the duration of the [[sodomy]] sequence before permitting the film to be released in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/CaseStudies/Last_Tango_in_Paris Case Study: ''Last Tango in Paris''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211065556/http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/CaseStudies/Last_Tango_in_Paris |date=11 December 2009 }}, Students' British Board of Film Classification page&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not cut in later releases. [[Mary Whitehouse]], a Christian morality campaigner, expressed outrage that the film had been certified "X" rather than banned outright, and Labour MP [[Maurice Edelman]] denounced the classification as "a license to degrade".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/last-tango-in-paris-can-it-arouse-the-same-passions-now-454083.html "Last Tango in Paris: Can it Arouse the Same Passions Now?"], ''Independent''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chile]] banned the film entirely for nearly thirty years under its military government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/13/world/after-banning-1092-movies-chile-relaxes-its-censorship.html|title=After Banning 1,092 Movies, Chile Relaxes Its Censorship|date=13 December 2002|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the film was similarly suppressed in [[Portugal]] (until the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974, when its première became an example of the freedom democracy allows) and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/article/916135--bertolucci-revisited-another-tango-with-the-master-of-taboo|title=Bertolucci revisited: Another tango with the master of taboo|date=5 January 2011|work=thestar.com|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the film was released uncut with an R certificate by the [[Australian Classification Board]] on 1 February 1973. It received a VHS release by [[Warner Home Video]] with the same classification on 1 January 1987, forbidding sale or hire to anyone under the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Pages/View.aspx?sid=70tr0BFXkCqqhXJPRdSvUw%253d%253d&amp;ncdctx=8JO1XlJQbIesPMapwiKVoO6RrlFeDeonhKVG5hjSB7Bh70Z4AqbI7%252fgXOBFryVW%2bSIcKn96R9MBIj1WNylQ6YQ%253d%253d|title=View Title: Last Tango in Paris|work=Australian Classification Board|access-date=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the film was released on 15 December 1972, grossing an unprecedented $100,000 in six days.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Mel. "Bertolucci Talks about Sex, Revolution, and 'Last Tango'{{-"}}. ''The New York Times'', 2 February 1973, pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; One week later, however, police seized all copies on the order of a prosecutor, who defined the film as "self-serving pornography", and its director was put on trial for "obscenity". Following first degree and appeal trials, the fate of the film was sealed on 26 January 1976 by the [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Italian Supreme Court]], which sentenced all copies to be destroyed (though some were preserved by the National Film Library). Bertolucci was served with a four-month suspended sentence in prison and had his civil rights revoked for five years, depriving him of voting rights.&lt;ref name="Stealing Beauty"/&gt;

In Canada, the film was banned by the [[Alcohol and Gaming Authority|Nova Scotia Board of Censors]], leading to the landmark 1978 [[Supreme Court of Canada]] split decision in ''[[Nova Scotia (Board of Censors) v McNeil]]'', which upheld the provinces' right to censor films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scc.lexum.org/en/1978/1978scr2-662/1978scr2-662.html |title=Supreme Court of Canada – Decisions |publisher=Scc.lexum.org |date= |access-date=20 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614035532/http://scc.lexum.org/en/1978/1978scr2-662/1978scr2-662.html |archivedate=14 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accolades ===

Brando received an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] and Bertolucci was nominated for [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]].&lt;ref name="Oscars46"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1974|title=The 46th Academy Awards (1974) Nominees and Winners|access-date=27 August 2013|publisher=oscars.org and Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|location=Beverly Hills}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13968">'''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]''' is the short title of a book, written by [[Henry Martyn Robert]], that is intended to be a guide for conducting meetings and making decisions as a group. Originally published in 1876, it has been revised regularly through the years, including two major revisions, by Robert and his successors based on feedback from users.

The earliest editions of his work are now in the [[public domain]]. Numerous titles have been published based on the public domain editions by those not associated with the original author nor his successors.

As of its publication in 2011, the 11th edition of '''''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised''''' (RONR) is the only current official version of the body of work known as "Robert's Rules of Order".

== Current official edition ==
The following edition "supersedes all previous editions and is intended automatically to become the [[parliamentary authority]] in organizations whose [[By-law|bylaws]] prescribe "Robert's Rules of Order," "Robert's Rules of Order Revised," "Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised," or "the current edition of" any of these titles, or the like, without specifying a particular edition."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = vii|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}} (RONR)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael D. Maltz''' (born 1938) is an American [[electrical engineer]], [[criminologist]] and [[Emeritus]] [[Professor]] at [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] in [[criminal justice]], and adjunct professor and researcher at [[Ohio State University]].

== Biography ==
Michael Maltz was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on December 18, 1938. He attended [[Stuyvesant High School]] in [[New York City]], graduating in 1955, and [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], graduating with a degree in [[electrical engineering]] in 1959. In 1963, Maltz earned a Ph.D. in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Stanford University]].

Maltz was a professor (1972–2002) at [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] in [[criminal justice]] and in [[Information Science|Information and]] [[Decision theory|Decision Sciences]], and is currently adjunct professor of [[sociology]] and researcher at [[Ohio State University]]. He was also the editor of the [[Journal of Quantitative Criminology]] from 1996 to 2000. In addition he was a Visiting Fellow for Research and Policy Studies at the US [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], from 1995 to 2000.

In 1985 Maltz was awarded the prestigious Lanchester Prize&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informs.org/Prizes/LanchesterPrize.html Lanchester Prize] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220084135/http://www.informs.org/Prizes/LanchesterPrize.html |date=2005-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Operations Research Society of America]], recognizing his book ''Recidivism''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/forr/pdf/crimjust/recidivism.pdf Recidivism]''&lt;/ref&gt;  as that year's "best contribution to operations research and the management sciences published in English". This book also won the Leslie T. Wilkins Award for the Outstanding Book in the Fields of Criminology and Criminal Justice. In 1996 Maltz had a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] at El Colegio de Michoacán in Mexico.

== Work ==
Michael Maltz' research focuses on the application of [[operations research]] and [[data visualization]] to the field of [[criminology]].  In addition to authoring books on [[recidivism]] and [[crime mapping]], he has been a strong advocate of ensuring that inferences made from data are not attributable to biases in the data used, nor to the way they were collected, nor to the methods used to analyze them. This interest has surfaced most publicly in his critique of [[John Lott]]'s [[More Guns, Less Crime]] (see "A Note on the Use of County-Level Crime Data" and "Measurement and Other Errors in County-Level UCR Data: A reply to Lott and Whitley" below) based primarily on a detailed analysis of the validity of the [[Uniform Crime Reports]] data set that Lott used to draw his conclusions. A further critique, of the way Lott responded to his analysis, was contained in a [http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2003/10/1025.php blog entry.]

He led an effort to clean the FBI-collected [[Uniform Crime Reports crime data]], which is available in a [http://cjrc.osu.edu/researchprojects/hvd/usa/ucrfbi/UCR1960-2004.zip zip file] on the web from the [http://cjrc.osu.edu/researchprojects/hvd/usa/ucrfbi/ Historical Violence Database], housed at Ohio State University.

A particularly lucid explanation of the pitfalls of improper use of [[statistics]] in social science (and, in particular, [[criminology]]) is contained in his article "Deviating from the Mean: The Declining Significance of Significance".

== Publications ==
Maltz has published numerous books and articles on techniques for making valid and useful inferences from data. Books, a selection:

The '''Missionary Generation''' was the name given by [[sociology|sociologists]] to describe  the [[generation]] of people born in the United States from 1860 to 1882.  It is an identified cohort within the [[Strauss–Howe generational theory]].[[File:Pre-election suffrage parade NYC.jpg|thumb|250px|Suffragists marching in New York, 1915. Social Crusades were a defining feature.]]

==Characteristics==
Members of the Missionary Generation have been described as the "home-and-hearth children of the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era". They were an idealist generation and as young adults, their leaders were the first graduates of newly formed black and women's colleges.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

They rejected the strict [[Victorian era|Victorian]] values, questioned gender roles and feared society would become soulless, inhumane, and money-driven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socalledmillennial.com/generational-cycles/  Generational Cycles] at so-called Millennials.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their defining characteristics were missionary and social crusades, "[[Muckraker|muckrake]]" [[journalism]], [[prohibitionism]], [[Labor rights|workers' rights]], [[trade union]]ism and [[universal suffrage|women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://socalledmillennial.com/generational-cycles/ Generational Cycles].&lt;/ref&gt; In midlife, they developed [[Prohibition in the United States]], [[immigration control]], and organized [[Vice#Vice squad|vice squads]].

Because the [[Lost Generation]] were so decimated by [[World War I]], the leadership of the Missionary Generation lasted longer than previous generations and in the 1930s and 1940s, their elite became the "Wise Old Men" who enacted a "[[New Deal]]", [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], led the global war against [[fascism]], and reaffirmed America's highest ideals during a transformative era in world history.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

This generation is fully ancestral, with the last known member of the Missionary Generation, the American [[Sarah Knauss]], having died on December 30, 1999 at 119 years of age.

Sociologist [[Naomi Schaefer Riley]] believes that a new "Missionary Generation" is forming in the children of the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Jacobsen, Rhonda Jacobsen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BlrD54cE_1wC&amp;pg=PT111&amp;lpg=PT111&amp;dq=missionary+generation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mHLEgXrFhW&amp;sig=ZTiQgKRLue_R_u2TI0h3QmzCRvk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sr0cVK7gCpfY8gXr_oDABw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=missionary%20generation&amp;f=false  The American University in a Postsecular Age] ([[Oxford University Press]], 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''multicultural family in South Korea''' is a family that made up of people without a background in [[Culture of Korea|Korean culture]]. As the number of multicultural families increased in Korean society, the number of children in multicultural families also increased. New policies have been created to respond to the problems faced by children of multicultural families.

==Definition==
Policies designed ot support multicultural families in South Korea are aimed at families with people who have acquired South Korean nationality. It can be defined as a family type where two cultures coexist in one family through [[international marriage]], but also includes the families of foreign workers, North Korean refugee families, and ethnic Korean families moving to Korea.

The first category, international marriage families, refers to a family consisting of a married Korean citizen and a foreign spouse. The second category, the families of [[foreign worker]]s, includes those that foreign workers bring with them to Korea or new families formed by foreign workers in Korea. Most of those families include children. The third category, [[North Korean refugee]] families, is composed of residents from North Korea with the official registration. These people have left North Korean society with various motives. In some cases, refugees escape North Korea with their family members, but policies are also designed for those who start a new family in South Korea.

Children of multicultural families are defined as children born between spouses of Koreans and foreign residents with different cultural background. At first, children of multicultural families were called ''Kosian'' or mixed-blood. Later, people started to use value-neutral term 'international marriage children' or 'children of international marriage immigrants'. More recently, people began to use the term 'children of multicultural families'.&lt;ref&gt;박솔지(Park Solji)(2010.2).

===Classification of children===

==== Children of international marriage immigrants ====
First, there are children of international marriage immigrants. Those are a children who one of their parents have Korean nationality and another parent have foreign nationality. Second, there are children of foreign worker's families. Immigrant worker bring their children over Korea or birth their children in Korea. Most of them have their own country's nationality, live in Korea as foreign. They cannot receive support based on Multicultural families supporting policy. It is a service for multicultural family to adapt to Korea and to support economical self-reliance. But the number of them has been increased and some of them acquired Korea nationality. Third, children of North Korean refugee family called 'saeteomin' as a defector. They acquire Korea nationality through naturalization. They have cultural problem because South Korea and North Korea have been formed different culture after the division of Korea into north and south.&lt;ref&gt;박현숙 ( Hyun Sook Park ),김광웅 ( Kwang Woong Kim ), "[http://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99533673 다문화가정 자녀 연구 동향= Research Trends Regarding Children in Multicultural Families in Korea]", 한국놀이치료학회지(Korea play psychotherapy journal)(놀이치료연구=Play psychotherapy study)/15(4), 2012., 459-485, 한국놀이치료학회(Korea play psychotherapy academy)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Sunny von Bülow|Martha "Sunny" von Bulow]]'s husband was arrested and charged with attempting to [[murder]] her by [[insulin]] [[drug overdose|overdose]] that ended up resulting in a irreversible [[coma]]. Her husband was convicted, but the conviction was overturned on [[appeal]]. At a second trial, he was found not guilty.&lt;ref name = carry&gt;Matthews, Sandra (January 7, 1986). "Victim Center to Carry von Bulow's Name". ''Orlando Sentinel''. p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At a national meeting of [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]], Alexander von Auersperg, her son, met E. Gene Patterson, a co-chairman of a national victims' coalition. The two of them teamed up with Morris Gurley, his mother's financial adviser, to form a new nonprofit organization with Patterson as director. The organization was named the Sunny von Bulow Victim Advocacy Center, and it was originally located in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. Auersperg envisioned the organization to be a national information and referral organization for victim-advocate groups.&lt;ref name = carry/&gt; 

The organization was renamed the National Victim Center around 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Susan Taylor (August 31, 1988). "A hot potato for candidates: prison furlough". ''Tampa Bay Times'' (St. Petersburg, Florida). p. 1A.&lt;/ref&gt; and it became the National Center for Victims of Crime in December 1998.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/19990209070852/http://www.ncvc.org:80/main/main.htm Dear Friend]".

The leaders of the nonprofit foundation Nóos Institute, [[Iñaki Urdangarin y Liebaert|Iñaki Urdangarin]], then Duke of Palma de Mallorca, and his business partner Diego Torres have been accused of using Nóos and a corporate network of companies to [[embezzlement|embezzle]] about 6 million euros ($6.6 million) in public funds for sporting events, [[perverting the course of justice]], [[Forgery|falsification]] and [[money laundering]]. 

==The accused==
In December 2011, the judge attendant of the [[Palma Arena]] case, José Castro, charged nine individuals.&lt;ref name="Vangimputado"&gt;{{cite news|title=Iñaki Urdangarín, imputado|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20111229/54243737747/inaki-urdangarin-imputado.html|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=29 December 2011|publisher=La Vanguardia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, after one of the accused, Diego Torres, had confessed, the list increased to 10.{{cn|date=September 2016}} {{as of|2016}} the list has grown to 18.&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.startribune.com/spain-princess-husband-begins-testifying-in-fraud-case/370247371/ | title=Spain: Princess Cristina's husband testifies in fraud case | work=Star Tribune | date=26 February 2016 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=9 September 2016 | author=ALAN CLENDENNING and CIARAN GILES}}&lt;/ref&gt;The main defendants have been:

*Diego Torres
*[[Infanta Cristina, Duchess of Palma de Mallorca|Cristina de Borbón y Grecia, Infanta of Spain]] (born on 13 June 1965), then Duchess of Palma, daughter of King [[Juan Carlos I]] of Spain.

*[[Jaume Matas|Jaume Matas i Palou]] (Palma de Mallorca, 1956), former Balearic president, one of the first defendants. Under his term the regional executive ordered the Nóos Institute to organize two forums about tourism and sport from which Urdangarín's company supposedly pocketed €2.3 million between 2005 and 2006. {{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Timeline==
In February 2006, Antoni Dieguez, a Socialist representative in the Balearic Parliament, said that the Government chaired by Jaume Matas had paid 1.2 million euros to the Nóos Institute for a 3-day forum on tourism and sport from 22 until 25 November 2005, with minimal impact.&lt;ref name="SigloRey"&gt;{{cite news |author=V.C. |title=El Rey frena a Urdangarin |date=2 May 2006 |work=El Siglo de Europa |url=http://www.elsiglodeuropa.es/siglo/historico/2006/696/696portada.html |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2007 the [[Palma Arena]] case began, when an imbalance of more than 50 million euros in the accounts of the newly opened sports center Palma Arena became public as it  had cost 110 million with a bidding price of 43 million.&lt;ref name="elpais"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/01/07/actualidad/1389109271_041224.htm | title=Del sobrecoste de un polideportivo al escándalo del ‘caso Urdangarin’ | work=El Pais | date=7 January 2014 | accessdate=9 September 2016 | author=Andreu Manresa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pfrang Association''' (also known as '''Pfrang''') is a [[charitable organization]] based in [[Nanjing]], China which raises money to assist with the education of children in the poor and rural regions of [[Jiangsu]] Province. Its aim is to help overcome [[social inequality]] and as a result break the cycle of lack of education, poverty, and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pfrangassociation.org/about-us.html | title = About us - Pfrang Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Pfrang Association was established in November 2000 in memory of the deaths of Sandra, Thorsten, Petra and Jürgen Pfrang, inspired by the desire to keep their memories alive in a positive way. Jürgen Pfrang was a German manager working for [[Daimler AG#Merger with Chrysler|DaimlerChrysler]]. During the night of 1 April 2000, Pfrang and his family were murdered in their house in Nanjing when four locals entered their home to rob them.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.people.com.cn/english/200005/18/eng20000518_41135.html&lt;/ref&gt; Six weeks later the four criminals were convicted and sentenced to death by the court. The Pfrang Association was set up within the same year by friends of the Pfrang family and other expatriates living in Nanjing.

==Background==
The Pfrang Association is hoping to uphold the name of those who were killed and tries to do so by helping to break the vicious circle of lack of education, unemployment and crime. The association has put their focus on making it financially possible for students to stay in school so that they may grow up, reach their full potential and as a result have many fulfilling opportunities in life. This action is meant to tackle the root of the problem and the association hopes to expand their program every year like they have in the past.

==Work==
Each year the Pfrang Association holds two major fundraising events, the Pfrang Gala in April and the Pfrang Day in October. Both of these events are held at Nanjing International School and have enjoyed great participation by expatriates living in Nanjing as well as locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.in-nanjing.net/pfrang |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430220833/http://www.in-nanjing.net/pfrang |archivedate=2009-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.beijingtoday.com.cn/tag/pfrang-association Breaking a circle of ignorance and crime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529122853/http://archive.beijingtoday.com.cn/tag/pfrang-association |date=2014-05-29 }}, ''[[Beijing Today]]'', January 13, 2010. Retrieved 2010-12-29&lt;/ref&gt;

In cooperation with the [[Amity Foundation, China|Amity Foundation]], the Pfrang Association has contacted a range of schools in the counties [[Lianshui]], [[Guanyun]] and [[Huai'an]] in northern Jiangsu Province, and financially supports middle and high school students who are heavily disadvantaged and meet some of the following criteria:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfrang-association.org/en-ourproject.html Our Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321062918/http://www.pfrang-association.org/en-ourproject.html |date=2011-03-21 }}, Pfrang Association. Retrieved 2010-12-29&lt;/ref&gt;

* the per capita income of the applicants household is below the locally defined poverty line.
* neither the parents nor the direct relatives receive regular salaries, or are employed by a government agency or private business.

Amongst the applicants who meet these criteria, priority is given to: 
* orphans
* students who are handicapped or who have a direct relative who is handicapped
* students from single parent families
* students from national minorities
* female students

The number of students supported by the Pfrang Association passed 500 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.163.com/special/00012Q9L/Pfrang100108.html The lucky ones should go to help the less fortunate] {{zh icon}}, [[163.com]], 2010-01-08. Retrieved 2010-12-29&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portuguese Surinamese people''' are [[Suriname]]se citizens of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry.

In 1853, the first Portuguese people arrived from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] island of [[Madeira]], having been sponsored by a coalition of planters and by the colonial government. They were actually on their way to [[British Guiana]], where the planters also sought alternative sources of labour after the abolition of slavery, but ended up in Suriname. A total of 500 Madeirans came as indentured workers to Suriname. At the end of their contract, they left the fields and sought an existence in the market. In later years, more immigrants from Madeira and British Guiana came to Suriname, however, no longer as indentured laborers but as free immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterkant.net/suriname/2013/07/01/madeireze-surinamers-column/|title=Madeireze Surinamers|work=Waterkant.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portuguese [[Sephardic Jews]] had settled between the 15th and 16th centuries before the [[Dutch Surinamese|Dutch]] arrived. The first [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Portuguese Jews]] came from the Netherlands, Portugal and Italy to settle in the old capital [[Torarica]].

A '''punk house''' is a dwelling occupied by members of the [[punk subculture]]. Punk houses are similar to the [[hippie]] crash pads of the 1960s and the [[slan shack]]s of [[science fiction fandom]]. [[The Factory]], an alternative living space founded by [[Andy Warhol]] as the home base of [[The Velvet Underground]], is directly linked to the formation of punk rock in [[New York City]]. In the early 1980s, a few punk gangs developed around allegiance to certain punk houses.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Punk houses are often centered on certain political or personal ideologies. It is not uncommon for a punk house to be [[anarchist]], strictly [[straight-edge]], or [[vegan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Penelope|title=Anarchy Rules: The Dishes Stay Dirty|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/garden/03punk.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=September 26, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A clique of punks may start a punk house by [[squatting]] an abandoned building, by renting, or by owning property. Punk houses are often communally inhabited in an attempt to minimize the individual expense of rent or [[property tax]].

Punk houses serve as backdrops for local [[Indie music scene|scenes]]; punk houses often provide overnight shelter to touring [[punk rock]] bands, and sometimes serve as a venue for shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Agnew|first=Meaghan|title=Dirty, chaotic, comfortable - welcome to the punk house|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2007/12/13/dirty_chaotic_comfortable___welcome_to_the_punk_house/|accessdate=September 26, 2011|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=December 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bands or record labels sometimes form in a particular punk house.

Like many other monarchies, the Russian Empire had a vast collection of [[regalia]] belonging to the Tsars. This collection is now on display in [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin in Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kvasha|first1=Semyon|title=Treasures of Imperial Russia on display in Moscow and St. Petersburg|url=http://rbth.com/arts/2013/05/01/treasures_of_imperial_russia_on_display_in_moscow_and_st_petersburg_25437.html|accessdate=19 September 2014|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Diamond Fund]] maintains the security of the greater diamond masterpieces.
[[File:Armoury-flickr06.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Russian historical regalia in Kremlin, part of showcase.]]

==Oldest Russian regalia==
* '''Barmas of Old Ryazan''', One of the greatest masterpieces of ancient jewelry were produced by masters of [[Principality of Ryazan|Old Ryazan]] in late 12th - early 13th century. They belonged to the local prince's family, but in 1237 the city was completely destroyed by [[Batu Khan]], and the jewelry lay underground for nearly 600 years. In 1822, the royal barmas were found by archeologists and brought to the Armory. These precious barmas are proof of the high level of local jewelry, enameled with their precious stones, gold medallions decorated with engraving. Medallions on one of the sets have a picture: The Crucifixion with the Virgin and John the Baptist, Virgin, Martyr Irene and Barbara, in royal attire Saints and others of the medallion has a Greek inscription, it is likely these parts have Byzantine origins.
* '''[[Monomakh's Cap|"Cap of Monomakh"]]''' The oldest crown is the "Cap of Monomakh" or Crown of Monomakh, used in the ceremony of crowning a monarch in [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]]. Its name is connected with a Russian legend of the 15th century, according to which it has been brought to Russia in ancient times as a gift from the [[Byzantine emperor|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]]. The cap is of oriental workmanship of the late 13th or early 14th century. The question of its origin is still unspecified. The oldest section of the crown consists of eight gold plates adorned with very fine gold lace in a pattern of six-pointed rosette-stars and lotus blossoms. The semi-spherical top with a cross, the sable trimming and the [[pearl]]s and gemstones belong to a later period. It weighs 698 grams and is the lightest Russian crown. Since the late 14th till the late 17th century, the Cap of Monomakh a symbol of power, was used in the ceremony of setting the ruler of the Russian State for reigning. In the first quarter of the 18th century, after [[Peter the Great]]'s [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|reforms]], the ceremonial setting for reigning was replaced by coronation, the main attribute of which became imperial crown. Since 18th century the Cap of Monomakh served as [[Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crown]] of the "Tsardom of [[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]] and [[Belarus|White]] Russia".
{{main|Monomakh's Cap}}
[[File:Bonnet de Monomaque.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Two oldest Russian crowns - [[Monomakh's Cap|"Cap of Monomakh"]] and Kazan Crown.]]
* '''Kazan crown''' The Crown of Kazan belonged to [[Yadegar Mokhammad of Kazan|Ediger Mahmet]], the last ruler of the [[Tatars|Tatar (Tartar)]] [[Khanate of Kazan|state of Kazan]]. This 16th century crown is the second oldest in Russia. The gold crown is studded with pearls, [[garnet]]s, and [[turquoise]]s. The sable-fur trimming was for comfort. The Kazan Crown is dated by 1553. It was first mentioned in the treasury of Tsar [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]], whose reigning was signed by a series of [[Russo-Kazan Wars|eminent events]] in the [[History of Russia|Russian history]]. Among them is the [[Siege of Kazan (1552)|capture of Kazan]] in October 1552 and annexation of the Kazan khanate to the Russian state. The precious crown might have been executed by Moscow Kremlin jewelers on the successful solution of "The Eastern problem", so important for Muscovy. Its name might have immortalized the memory of the glorious victory of Russian warriors. The crown's look combines national and eastern artistic traditions. Some elements remind decor traditions of Russian churches of the epoch. At the same time, combination of stones, e.g. red [[tourmaline]]s and [[Ruby|rubies]] with blue [[turquoise]] and carved ornament of knitting herbs on niello background represent oriental artistic influence. Since 18th century this crown served as [[Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crown]] of the [[Khanate of Kazan|"Tsardom of Kazan"]].
* '''Ivory throne''' This is earliest survived tsars throne of the mid-16th century. This fine specimen of [[Renaissance]] culture was made of wood faced with plates of [[ivory]] and walrus tusk therefore it was called the "carved bone armchair". The carved ornament unites the various subjects and representations into a single composition. Decorative scenes include images from [[Greek mythology]] and the [[Old Testament]]. The depicted themes, the style of the carving and the motifs, which include grotesques and [[Cupid]]s, enable researches to date most of the pieces to the 16th century and attribute them to Western European [[Renaissance]] craftsmen. This bone throne has been renovated several times in Russia: worn pieces of bone were remade by local craftsmen; in 1856, on the occasion of the coronation of Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], the throne was decorated with a gilded silver two-headed eagle.
[[File:Ivans ivory throne.jpg|160px|thumb|left|[[Ivory]] throne of [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]]]]

==Regalia of Boris Godunov==
* '''Golden throne''' In addition to the bone chair the showcase includes a throne of oriental workmanship executed in the late 16th century. Having been presented by [[Shah]] [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] to Tsar [[Boris Godunov]] it was called a "Persian throne with stones". The form of the throne with its low back flowing into sloping arm-rests, reveals features typical of Iranian furniture of the 16th-17th centuries. The makers have used ornament beloved in the East, i.e. strips of gold decorated with a foliate pattern and coloured stones - [[Turquoise|blue turquoises]] and [[Ruby|red rubies]], [[tourmaline]]s. The back of the seat, the arms and the whole lower section of the throne were covered with gold Persian fabric, replaced by French [[velvet]] in 1742 for the coronation of Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]]. In total this throne is adorned 552 rubies and pink tourmalines, 825 turquoises, 177 [[pearl]]s and 700 halves of pearls.

'''Scepter and orb''' are magnificent creations of West-European jewelry of Late [[Renaissance]]. By the way, the [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]] on relief technique was not known to Russian goldsmiths of that time. There are reasons to consider the scepter and orb to belong to the set of gifts, brought to Tsar [[Boris Godunov]] in 1604 by the Great Embassy of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], Emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Great Roman Empire]]. The scepter and orb, miraculously survived through the [[Time of Troubles]], must have been used in 1613 in crowning of [[Michael of Russia|Michael Fyodorovich]], first Tsar of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov Dynasty]]. For later on during the whole reigning of Michael Fyodorovich they were unique regalia of the kind and belonged to the so-called "Grand set" (precious tsars attire) complex of especially valuable regalia. Later "Grand set", which, except for the state regalia, included an armour set, that accompanied the Tsar in processions, e.g. [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)|military companies]] and hunting.
* '''The sceptre''' The golden scepter is graceful and proportional, with rich and dainty ornamental motifs. The heads of cherubs, flowers and clusters of fruits suspended on ribbons – everything belongs to a unique, rhythmically sized composition. This ancient sceptre has 1 [[emerald]], 20 [[Diamond (gemstone)|diamonds]] and a few other precious stones.
* '''The orb''' Huge golden orb is crowned with a cross. In the upper hemisphere girdles separate it into four sections each with an [[Old Testament]] scene from [[David|King David]]'s life: "Chrosmation of King David by Prophet [[Samuel (Biblical figure)|Samuel]]", "David's mastering [[Goliath]]", "Coming home with the victory", "Persecution from [[Saul]]". Shining gems, green emeralds, red rubies, and blue [[sapphire]]s, encircle the [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] ornamentation. The Orb has 58 diamonds, 89 rubies and tourmalines, 23 sapphires, 51 emeralds and 37 pearls. Except for the 4 enamels, the entire orb, including the cross, is thoroughly encrusted with the various gems.

==Regalia of Michael Fyodorovich==
[[File:Astrahan hat.png|160px|thumb|right|The crown of "Grand set" - "Astrahan crown"]]

* '''Golden throne''' The throne of Tsar Mikhail Fyodorovich was executed at the beginning of the 17th century from the old chair of oriental workmanship which had belonged to [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]]. In its form, high back and arms, it resembles Russian armchairs, but oriental motifs still remain in the ornament:[http://s57.radikal.ru/i156/0910/ec/97d2fc8ec929t.jpg] The throne is faced with embossed gold and adorned with [[Ruby|rubies]], [[pearl]]s, [[turquoise]] and other uncut stones. The throne was made in the early 17th century in Kremlin Workshops. Its decoration is similar to that of the throne of [[Boris Godunov]]. 13 kilos of gold, gemstones and pearls were used for its ornamentation. Partly throne's decoration haven’t survived.

* '''Silver double throne''' The Double throne of Tsars [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan Alekseyevich]] and Peter Alekseyevich, which serves as a vivid illustration of the unique historical moment, when two tsarevitches were crowned together:[http://www.history-illustrated.ru/illustrations/preview/2428.jpg] Tsar Alexis died leaving three sons. After the death of the eldest one, [[Feodor III of Russia|Theodore]], fifteen-year-old [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan]] should have inherited the throne, but he was feeble-minded and in poor health. So it was decided to crown the two brothers together, [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan]] and ten-year-old Peter (the future Peter the Great). The double-seated throne was executed specially for the occasion by the Kremlin craftsmen in the 1680s. Its constriction including open-work arch on twisted columns, silver steps below and a high back with two silver pillars on each side resembles elegant architectural forms. The necessary instructions and advice were transmitted through a small orifice cut into the back of the throne and concealed by the [[velvet]] covering. The shape of the throne is finished with a lavish ornamentation. The openwork embossment, three-dimensional animal figures, carving and high relief, contrasting combination of silver and gilt are exemplificative of the [[Baroque|Baroque style]].

* '''Cap of Monomach of second set''' Simple "cap of Monomakh of the second set" of Tsar Peter I Alekseevich was executed by Kremlin Workshops for the 1682 crowning ceremony, when two small sons of Alexis Mikhailovich – [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan]] and Peter  – were inaugurated as Tsars:[http://territa.ru/_ph/527/2/288963493.jpg] The creators did their best following the ancient original. It reminds an Eastern headdress and consists of 8 golden plates. The crown has a dome-shaped top with a cross. However, there is certain difference in artistic decoration of the two crowns. The surface of the ancient one is covered with a delicate filigree ornamentation. The golden plates of the new crown were left smooth. Cold shining metal with sharp symmetric decor makes impression of elegant severity, a bit mildened by bright and colourful precious stones. Since 18th centhury this crown served as [[Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crown]] of [[Tsardom of the Chersonnese Taurics]].
* '''Altabas crown''' Altabas crown of the third set of Tsar [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan V Alekseevich]] was executed by Russian masters in 1684. Altabas is a precious cloth, similar to brocade. So the crown was named altabas. It is the only tsars crown executed of cloth. For the crown would not lose the shape, it had an inner frame of smooth silver arches.

Some of these plates were taken from the not survived [[Diamond (gemstone)|Diamond]] Crown of [[Feodor III of Russia|Tsar Theodore Alekseevich]]. In total it has circa 100 gemstones and [[pearl]]s. Since 18th century this crown served as [[Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crown]] of [[Siberia Khanate|"Tsardom of Siberia"]].

* '''Diamond crown'''This crown was executed by Russian masters for Tsar Peter I Alekseevich in the 1680s:[http://vseromanovi.narod.ru/img/shapka_petra.jpg] A similar crown was made for his elder brother, crowned at the same time. The decor of the crown represents specific features of Russian jewelry of the late 17th century, a specific feature of which was active using of precious stones. Shining [[Diamond (gemstone)|diamonds]] and gems always attracted attention of Russian goldsmiths, and that time they became the main point of jewelry artworks. The Crown of Peter Alekseevich was enriched with green [[emerald]]s and red [[tourmaline]]s. In total metallic golden frame of crown is adorned 807 [[Diamond (gemstone)|diamonds]] (in 32 designs) and 13 other gemstones.
* '''Diamond crown''' One of the two crowns was made in the 1680s by Russian jewelers for [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan V Alekseevich]]:[http://s40.radikal.ru/i089/1003/e1/2c9a58a51ebd.jpg] The decor of the crown is traditional for Russian jewelry of the late 17th century, a special point of which was active use of luxurious precious stones.

* '''Pectoral cross of Tsar Peter I Alekseevich''' The golden cross of Tsar Peter Alekseevich was made in Kremlin workshops in the 1780s. In the center of its obverse there is a small cross made of magnificent [[emerald]]s of different cutting and shape, adorned with openwork vegetation ornament and [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]]. The shape and decor of the [[emerald]] cross allow to classify it as an artwork of West European silversmiths of the 16-17th centuries. A carved crucifix on one [[emerald]] and a carved inscription "NIKA" on another are of Russian origin and can be dated by the same time.On the cross's reverse there is a front [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] image of [[Saint Peter|Apostle Peter]], the Tsar's patron Saint. The enamelled decor of the cross in combination with shining precious stones give major impression in accordance with the common tendencies of development of Russian art of the time. The bright artistic concept and brilliant craft make the item a true masterpiece of the 18th century jewelry.
* '''Sceptre of Tsar Peter I Alekseevich''' The sceptre belonging to Tsar Peter I was made of gold and adorned with colour [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]] and precious stones. The hexahedral sceptre divides into three with three bolsters and its lower part ends with a bolster with a figured knob. The sceptre's form and details are close to the sceptre of Tsar Michael Fyodorovich of the 17th century. The decor reflects artistic taste of the late 17th century. Black and pink [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]] on blue background, vegetation ornament of miniature graceful tulips, leaves and curls – all these have analogies in artworks by Kremlin jewelers of the 1780s and 1790s. The sceptre must have been executed in 1682 on the occasion of setting for reigning of brothers [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan]] and Peter Alekseevich. While the ceremonial, [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan Alekseevich]] took the sceptre of his grandfather, and the new sceptre, created following the pattern of the worshipped holy, was brought for the younger Tsar, Peter Alekseevich.

The '''Saraguro''' is a people of the Kichwa nation most of whom live in [[Saraguro Canton]] in the [[Loja Province]] of [[Ecuador]].  Although most now speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Runashimi'' or [[Kichwa]], a [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] dialect, is also spoken and language revitalization efforts are being implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Kendall|title=Language revitalization processes and prospects: Quichua in the Ecuadorian Andes|date=2001|publisher=Multilingual Matters LTD|location=Clevedon, UK;Buffalo, N.Y|pages=185–190|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=54a49a7a-ca8f-4ed2-8183-b9a901e6347d%40sessionmgr101&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=nlebk&amp;AN=90959|accessdate=18 March 2018|ref=King}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinez|first1=M|last2=Paladines|first2=F|last3=Yaguache|first3=J|title=Relación medio-comunidad a través del estudio del programa kawsaypura yachanakushun en el cantón Saraguro|journal=Palabra Clave|date=2008|volume=11|issue=1|pages=49–50|url=http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=64911104|accessdate=16 March 2018|ref=saraguro}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the Saraguro have retained much of their land, customs and traditional dress.

The Saraguro may be the descendants of people re-settled from distant regions in the [[Inca Empire]] in the 15th and early 16th century.
   
==Origins==
[[File:Saraguro woman.jpg|thumb|right|A Saraguro woman wearing a 
traditional dress. ]]
In the 1460s the Inca empire conquered the Saraguro area.  The pre-Inca people may have been the barely-known [[Palta people|Palta]] or the [[Cañari]]. The ancestors of the modern-day Saraguro people, according to oral traditions, were moved to Saraguro by the Incas from other areas, possibly the [[Colla people|Colla]] or other people from the [[Lake Titicaca]] and [[Cuzco]] regions. The Incas had a policy of forcibly moving people from one region of the empire to another, thereby diversifying the population and dispersing possible opposition to their rule.  The resettlement policy was called [[mitma]]. The numbers resettled were large, estimated to be up to 80 percent of the population of some provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Ogburn, Dennis J. (nd), ''Incas Past and Present: Archaeology and the Indigenous Saraguros of Southern Ecuador", ''Stanford Journal of Archaeology'', https://web.stanford.edu/dept/archaeology/journal/07Ogburn.pdf, accessed 24 Mar 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
One Spanish document says that the ancestors of present-day Saraguros were elite soldiers in the Inca army.  This statement is bolstered by the fact that the Saraguros live along the Inca road or [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1459 Kapak Ñan] that stretched from Cuzco to [[Tumebamba]] (the northern capital of the Incas), and onward to [[Quito]]  and thus occupied an important link for Inca communications and control of the empire. The town of Saraguro, however, seems to have been founded by the Spanish rather than the Incas although a number of Inca ruins are in the nearby area.&lt;ref&gt;Belote, Jim and Belote, Linda (2004), "The Incas in the Saraguro Region", http://www.saraguro.org/archinka.htm, accessed 24 Mar 2017; Ogburn (nd), pp. 141-143&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the facts about their origins. Saraguro in the 20th century celebrate their Inca heritage.  In a debunked theory, some authors ascribe the black clothing typical of the Saraguro as a sign of mourning for the death of the Inca Emperor [[Atahualpa]].  Schools have been named after Inca emperors, Inca customs recreated, Inca architecture copied, and efforts made to preserve the Kichwa language.&lt;ref&gt;Ogburn (nd), pp. 142-149&lt;/ref&gt; Historical records and oral traditions also attribute the traditional black and white colors of their clothing to ceremony and nobility, which were the meanings given by the Incas according to chronicler Cieza de León and recounted by the Saraguro. Being descendants of the elite soldiers of the Inca army, they retained that symbolism as well as the male population retained their long-braided hair, which was another marker of nobility among the Incas. Black as a sign of mourning is not part of the Inca symbolism nor among the Saraguros but has been adopted, especially by the young generations. Likewise, they attribute the symbolic concepts of their clothing to a representation of the ''Curiquingue'' ([[carunculated caracara]]), which has black and white feathers and was a symbolic bird of the Inca royalty. The ''Curiquingue'' inhabits the Saraguro parish and páramos and its symbols represented in costumes continue to be present in the Kapak Raymi (the Great Celebration) celebrations in Saraguro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bacacela Gualán|first1=Sisa Pacari|title=La Cultura espiritual: una resistencia de los Saraguros en la actualidad.

[[File:Carunculated Caracara.jpg|thumb|right|Carunculated Caracara]]
The Saraguros have retained control over their lands more successfully than many of the Andean subjects of Spanish colonization and contemporary colonialism &lt;ref name="Atawallpa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oviedo Freire|first1=Atawallpa|title=El colonialismo sigue intacto|url=https://lalineadefuego.info/2014/08/27/el-colonialismo-sigue-intacto-atawallpa-oviedo-freire/|website=La Linea de Fuego|accessdate=14 March 2018|date=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martinez"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinez|first1=Carmen|title=Academic freedom and Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|journal=LasaForum|date=2016|volume=47|issue=2|pages=37–40|url=http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/forum/files/vol47-issue2/Dossier6.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the independent country of Ecuador. Part of this may be due to their initial hostility to the Spanish and the Indigenous people who collaborated with them. More importantly, however, the Saraguros were required by the Spanish to maintain an important [[Tambo (Incan structure)|tambo]] (inn or way-station) along a major communication route.  They successfully argued that the operation and maintenance of the tambo required that they retain their land and its resources. They continued to manage the tambo until the 1940s when a motor road reached the area.&lt;ref name="Belote"&gt;Belote, Jim and Belote, Linda S. (1999), "The Saraguros, 1962-1997: A Very Brief Overview", http://www.saraguro.org/overview.htm, accessed 24 Mar 2017|ref=Belote&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Saraguros==
Most of the Saraguros live at intermediate elevations in the [[Andes]] between {{convert|1800|m|ft}} and {{Convert|2800|m|ft}}. Traditionally they are farmers and livestock herders.  A shortage of land in their homeland has led many to migrate eastward into the [[Zamora-Chinchipe Province]] of Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;Belote and Belote (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Others have migrated to Europe and the United States. Many contemporary Saraguros are doctors, architects, engineers, 
musicians, photographers, construction workers, artisans, farmers, entrepreneurs, politicians, teachers, lawyers, cooks, activists. And others continue to do agro-pastoralist activities while holding professional careers or combine more than one occupation. While having a distinctive identity, they are engaged in the consummer society and technology as much as most the Ecuadorian society is. Issues such as teenage pregnancy, environmental degradation, deforestation, discrimination, racism, discontinuation of traditions are also present across the Saraguro territory.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Syring|first1=David|title=With the Saraguros: The blended life in a transnational world|date=2014|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|pages=37–65|url=10.7560/760936|accessdate=17 March 2018|doi=10.7560/760936|doi-broken-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanger|first1=James|title=Comuneros: Community and Indigeneity in Saraguro, Ecuador|date=2011|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|pages=84–113|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/926963127?pq-origsite=summon|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Young Saraguro musicians break from tradition not only to index their aspirations to do something with their lives other than what tradition and stereotypes dictate for them, but also to index their real opportunities to do so as Saraguros. With greater participation in formal education and increased occupational diversity and mobility, young, cosmopolitan Saraguro musicians in the southern highlands of Ecuador are working to reconstitute their Saraguro Kichwa identity in a creative and selective process by which they discard, amplify, and reinvent the aspects of what they perceive to be authentic Saraguro musical culture.&lt;ref name="Volinsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Volinsky|first1=N|title=Standing up: Violin performance technique and ethnic resurgence in Saraguro, Ecuador|journal=Visual Anthropology|date=2003|volume=16|issue=2–3|pages=315–340|doi=10.1080/08949460310020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They also have found other ways of expressing themselves that are compatible with their self-identification as Indigenous and do not strictly rely on ties to an Inkaic past, or even to a particular expression of Indigeneity. Rather, the tastes and ambitions of many Saraguro youth point to an alternative conceptualization of Saraguro identity that is both firmly rooted in the "modern" and respectful of a long tradition of Indigeneity. A large number of (primarily male) Saraguro youth affiliate themselves with a subculture of heavy metal music. They listen to nation and international metal bands. Some of them play in local bands and organize local concerts.&lt;ref name="Stanger"/&gt;

==Film==

The film ''Saraguro: Historia Escrita con Sangre Inka'' (2010) (Saraguro: A History Written with Inka Blood) traces the roots of the origins of the Saraguro people by combining anthropological data with Inkan cosmovision in consultation with the Saraguro people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=AGN|last1=El Mercurio|title=Saraguro: historia con sangre Inka|url=https://www.elmercurio.com.ec/251608-%E2%80%9Csaraguro-historia-con-sangre-inka%E2%80%9D/|publisher=Diario el Mercurio|accessdate=12 March 2018|ref=sangre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''social aspects of [[television]]''' are influences this [[mass media|medium]] has had on society since its inception. The belief that this impact has been dramatic has been largely unchallenged in [[media theory]] since its inception. However, there is much dispute as to what those effects are, how serious the ramifications are and if these effects are more or less evolutionary with [[human communication]].

== Positive effects ==

===Social surrogacy hypothesis===
Current research is discovering that individuals suffering from [[social isolation]] can employ television to create what is termed a [[Parasocial interaction|parasocial]] or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Butler, Fionnuala|author2=Cynthia Pickett|title=Imaginary Friends|work=Scientific American|publisher=Scientific American|date= 28 July 2009|accessdate=26 March 2010|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/imaginary-friends/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as an individual would spend time with a real person sharing opinions and thoughts, pseudo-relationships are formed with TV characters by becoming personally invested in their lives as if they were a close friend&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"/&gt; so that the individual can satiate the human desire to form meaningful relationships and establish themselves in society.  Jaye Derrick and Shira Gabriel of the University of Buffalo, and Kurt Hugenberg of Miami University found that when an individual is not able to participate in interactions with real people, they are less likely to indicate feelings of loneliness when watching their favorite TV show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WJB-4V74XVH-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=02%2F28%2F2009&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=7797bc404e45e0a80e9bb84374599eae | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.12.003 | volume=45 | title=Social surrogacy: How favored television programs provide the experience of belonging | journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | pages=352–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They refer to this finding as the social surrogacy hypothesis.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"/&gt;  Furthermore, when an event such as a fight or argument disrupts a personal relationship, watching a favorite TV show was able to create a cushion and prevent the individual from experiencing reduced self-esteem and feelings of inadequacy that can often accompany the perceived threat.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"/&gt;  By providing a temporary substitute for acceptance and belonging that is experienced through social relationships, TV helps to relieve feelings of depression and loneliness when those relationships are not available.  This benefit is considered a positive consequence of watching television, as it can counteract the psychological damage that is caused by isolation from social relationships.

=== Educational advantages ===
{{main article|Educational television}}
Several studies have found that [[educational television]] has many  advantages. The Media Awareness Network&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/corporate/about_us/index.cfm Media Awareness Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202123356/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/corporate/about_us/index.cfm |date=2006-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; explains in its article "The Good Things about Television"&lt;ref name="good-things-about-tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediasmarts.ca/television/good-things-about-television|author=Media Awareness Network|title=The Good Things About Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely. The article states that television can help young people discover where they fit into society, develop closer relationships with peers and family, and teach them to understand complex social aspects of communication.&lt;ref name="good-things-about-tv"/&gt; Dimitri Christakis cites studies in which those who watched ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and other educational programs as preschoolers had higher grades, were reading more books, placed more value on achievement and were more creative. Similarly, while those exposed to negative role models suffered, those exposed to positive models behaved better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=tvoped22&amp;date=20070222&amp;query=television |date=February 22, 2007 |title=Smarter kids through television: debunking myths old and new |author=Dimitri Christakis |publisher=Seattle Times Newspaper |accessdate=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative effects ==

The rich array of pejoratives for television (for example, "boob tube" and "chewing gum for the mind" and so forth) indicate a disdain held by many people for this medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Complaints about the social influence of television have been heard from the U.S. justice system as investigators and prosecutors decry what they refer to as "the [[CSI syndrome]]". They complain that, because of the popularity and considerable viewership of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' and its spin-offs, juries today expect to be 'dazzled", and will acquit criminals of charges unless presented with impressive physical evidence, even when motive, testimony, and lack of alibi are presented by the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Van Zandt, Clint (MSNBC analyst &amp; former FBI profiler|date=3 August 2005|title=The Real World vs. the CSI Syndrome|work=msnbc.msn.com|accessdate=27 October 2007|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8802371/}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
    
[[Television]] has also been credited with changing the norms of social propriety, although the direction and value of this change are disputed. [[Milton Shulman]], writing about television in the 1960s, wrote that "TV [[cartoons]] showed cows without udders and not even a pause was pregnant," and noted that on-air vulgarity was highly frowned upon. Shulman suggested that, even by the 1970s, television was shaping the ideas of propriety and appropriateness in the countries the medium blanketed. He asserted that, as a particularly "pervasive and ubiquitous" medium, television could create a comfortable familiarity with and acceptance of language and behavior once deemed socially unacceptable. Television, as well as influencing its viewers, evoked an imitative response from other competing media as they struggle to keep pace and retain viewer- or readership.&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, Milton (1973) The Ravenous Eye, Cassell and Company, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;   
    
According to a study published in 2008, conducted by John Robinson and Steven Martin from the [[University of Maryland]], people who are not satisfied with their lives spend 30% more time watching TV than satisfied people do. The research was conducted with 30,000 people during the period between 1975 and 2006. This contrasted with a previous study, which indicated that watching TV was the happiest time of the day for some people. Based on his study, Robinson commented that the pleasurable effects of television may be likened to an [[addiction|addictive]] activity, producing "momentary pleasure but long-term misery and regret."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=John P. |last2=Martin |first2=Steven |date=2008-07-31 |title=What Do Happy People Do? |journal=[[Social Indicators Research]] |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=565–571 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |format=Portable Document Format |id= |isbn= |issn=1573-0921 |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |doi=10.1007/s11205-008-9296-6 |accessdate=2011-12-29 |url=http://www.popcenter.umd.edu/research/faculty-projects/john-robinson/articles/social-indicators/10-happiness.pdf |laysource=University of Maryland Newsdesk |laysummary=http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/sociss/release.cfm?ArticleID=1789 |laydate=2009-11-14 |quote=If interpreted in the Princeton group's framework of activity as experienced being the sine qua non of measurement, that would mean that TV represents a highly enjoyable activity that would improve the quality of people's lives, given that more of Americans' free time is being devoted to it.

As noted at the outset, whether that means happiness leads to lower viewing, or that more viewing leads to unhappiness, cannot be determined from these data, and thus will require a panel design along with some careful observational study.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological effects ===
One theory says that when a person plays [[video game]]s or watches TV, the [[basal ganglia]] portion of the [[brain]] becomes very active and [[dopamine]] is released. Some scientists believe that release of high amounts of dopamine reduces the amount of the [[neurotransmitter]] available for control of movement, perception of pain and pleasure and formation of feelings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adult-child-add-adhd.com/categories/child/adhd-and-tv.php ADHD - ADD Videos Games and TV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A study conducted by Herbert Krugman found that in television viewers, the right side of the brain is twice as active as the left side, which causes a state of [[hypnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, W. (2004). Television: Opiate of the Masses. Familyresources.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that watching television starting at a young age can profoundly affect children's development. These effects include obesity, language delays, and learning disabilities. Physical inactivity while viewing TV reduces necessary exercise and leads to over-eating. Language delays occur when a child doesn't interact with others. Children learn language best from live interaction with parents or other individuals. Resulting learning disabilities from over-watching TV include ADHD, concentration problems and even reduction of IQ. Children who watch too much television can thus have difficulties starting school because they aren't interested in their teachers. Children should watch a maximum of 2 hours daily if any television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanchildinstitute.org/articles/policy-briefs/infants-toddlers-and-television|title=Infants, Toddlers and Television|website=www.urbanchildinstitute.org|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"I have observed the physical symptoms of television-looking on children as well as on adults. The mouth grows slack and the lips hang open; the eyes take on a hypnotized or doped look; the nose runs rather more than usual; the backbone turns to water and the fingers slowly and methodically pick the designs out of brocade furniture. Such is the appearance of semiconsciousness that one wonders how much of the 'message' of television is getting through to the brain."&lt;ref&gt;Steinbeck, John. ''The Reporter'', March 10, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children under two years of age should not watch any television and children two and older should watch one to two hours at most.  Children who watch more than four hours of television a day are more likely to become overweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/work-play/Media/Pages/The-Benefits-of-Limiting-TV.aspx |title=The Benefits of Limiting TV |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |date=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/positive/family/tv_affects_child.html |title=How TV affects your child |publisher=Kids Health |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislators, scientists and parents are debating the effects of [[television violence]] on viewers, particularly youth. Fifty years of research on the impact of television on children's emotional and social development have not ended this debate.&lt;ref name="Bushman2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Savage2008"/&gt;

A 2002 article in Scientific American suggested that compulsive television watching, [[television addiction]], was no different from any other [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]], a finding backed up by reports of withdrawal symptoms among families forced by circumstance to cease watching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

However, recent research (Schmidt et al., 2009) has indicated that, once other factors are controlled for, television viewing appears to have little to no impact on cognitive performance, contrary to previous thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marie Evans Schmidt|author2=Michael Rich|author3=Sheryl L.

A study published in the ''[[Journal of Sexuality Research and Social Policy]]'' concluded that parental television involvement was associated with greater body satisfaction among adolescent girls, less sexual experience amongst both male and female adolescents, and that parental television involvement may influence self-esteem and body image, in part by increasing parent-child closeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Many studies have found little or no effect of television viewing on viewers&lt;ref name="Freedman2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=J|year=2002|title=Media violence and its effect on aggression.: Assessing the scientific evidence|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-3553-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see Freedman, 2002).

Ferguson, ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence''&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2000 the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry stated that "prolonged viewing of media violence can lead to emotional desensitization toward violence in real life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|authors=American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, American Psychological Association, American Medical Association, American Academy of Family Physicians, &amp; American Psychiatric Association|date=July 26, 2000|title=Joint statement on the impact of entertainment violence on children|work=American Academy of Pediatrics website|url=http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/jstmtevc.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815060056/http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/jstmtevc.htm|archivedate=August 15, 2000 |deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, scholars have since analyzed several statements in this release, both about the number of studies conducted, and a comparison with medical effects, and found many errors.&lt;ref&gt;Block &amp; Crain, 2007; Freedman, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propaganda ===

Television is used to promote commercial, social and political agendas. Public service announcements (including those paid for by governing bodies or politicians), [[news]] and [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]], [[television advertisement]]s, [[advertorial]]s and [[talk show]]s are used to influence public opinion. The Cultivation Hypothesis suggests that some viewers may begin to repeat questionable or even blatantly fictitious information gleaned from the media as if it were factual. Considerable debate remains, however, whether the Cultivation Hypothesis is well supported by scientific literature, however, the effectiveness of television for propaganda (including commercial advertising) is unsurpassed. The US military and State Department often [[Psychological Operations (United States)#Media|turn to media to broadcast into hostile territory or nation]].&lt;ref&gt;"Psychological Operations Field Manual No.33-1" published in August 1979 by Department of the Army Headquarters in Washington DC; and "Psychological Operations (PSYOP) Media Subcourse PO-0816" by The Army Institute for Professional Development, published in 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
While the effects of [[television program]]s depend on what is actually [[TV consumption|consumed]], [[Neil Postman]] argues that the dominance of entertaining, but not informative programming, creates a politically ignorant society, undermining democracy: "Americans are the best entertained and quite likely the least-informed people in the Western world."&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Postman]]. ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business]].'' Penguin USA, 1985. {{ISBN|0-670-80454-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some broadcasters do offer Americans intelligent political narrative and argument.  This offers otherwise ignorant viewers, who may not read about politics elsewhere, the opportunity to access current or historical political views, for example.

Another interesting facet of the introduction of television to the political scene can be observed in the infamous Kennedy-Nixon presidential debate of 1960. Although the actual influence of television in these debates have been argued over time, the recent studies of James N. Druckman, previous professor at the University of Minnesota, determined that the visually-based television may have allowed viewers to evaluate the candidates more on their image (including perceived personality traits), than previous popular mediums which allowed the transmission of voice alone. Termed "viewer-listener" disagreement, this phenomenon may still affect the political scene of today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Power of Television Images: The First Kennedy-Nixon Debate Revisited|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0022381600001900|journal = The Journal of Politics|date = 2003-05-01|issn = 1468-2508|pages = 559–571|volume = 65|issue = 02|doi = 10.1111/1468-2508.t01-1-00015|first = James N.|last = Druckman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender and television ==
While women, who were "traditionally more isolated than men" were given [[equal opportunity]] to consume shows about more "manly" endeavors, men's "feminine" sides are tapped by the emotional nature of many television programs.&lt;ref&gt;Meyrowitz, Joshua (1995) "Mediating Communication: What Happens?" in John Downing, Ali Mohammadi and Annabelle Sreberny-Mohamadi (eds) ''Questioning the Media'', Sage, Thousand Oaks, pp. 39-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Television played a significant role in the [[feminist movement]]. Although most of the women portrayed on television conformed to stereotypes, television also showed the lives of men as well as news and current affairs. These "other lives" portrayed on television left many women unsatisfied with their current [[socialization]].

The representation of males and females on the television screen has been a subject of much discussion since the television became commercially available in the late 1930s. In 1964 [[Betty Friedan]] claimed that "television has represented the [[United States|American]] Woman as a "stupid, unattractive, insecure little household drudge who spends her martyred mindless, boring days dreaming of love—and plotting nasty revenge against her husband." As women started to revolt and protest to become equals in society in the 1960s and 1970s, their portrayal on the television was an issue that they addressed. Journalist [[Susan Faludi]] suggested, "The practices and programming of network television in the 1980s were an attempt to get back to those earlier [[stereotypes]] of women." Through television, even the most homebound women can experience parts of our culture once considered primarily male, such as sports, war, business, medicine, law, and politics. Since at least the 1990s there has been a trend of showing males as insufferable and possibly spineless fools (e.g. Homer Simpson, Ray Burone).
 
The inherent intimacy of television makes it one of the few public arenas in our society where men routinely wear makeup and are judged as much on their personal appearance and their "style" as on their "accomplishments."

From 1930 till today [[daytime television]] hasn't changed much. [[Soap operas]] and [[talk shows]] still dominate the daytime time slot. [[Prime time|Primetime]] television since the 1950s has been aimed at and catered towards males. In 1952, 68% of characters in primetime dramas were male; in 1973, 74% of characters in these shows were male. In 1970 the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) took action. They formed a task force to study and change the "derogatory stereotypes of women on television." In 1972 they challenged the licences of two network-owned stations on the basis of their sexist programming. In the 1960s the shows ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and ''[[Bewitched]]'' insinuated that the only way that a woman could escape her duties was to use magic. Industry analysis [[Shari Anne Brill]] of Carat USA states, "For years, when men were behind the camera, women were really ditsy. Now you have female leads playing superheroes, or super business women." Current network broadcasting features a range of female portrayals. This is evident in a 2014 study showing that "42% of all major characters on television are female".&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/research.html BOXED IN: EMPLOYMENT OF BEHIND-THE-SCENES AND ON-SCREEN WOMEN IN 2013-14 PRIME-TIME TELEVISION]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology trends ==
In its infancy, television was a time-dependent, fleeting medium; it acted on the schedule of the institutions that broadcast the television signal or operated the cable. Fans of regular shows planned their [[broadcast programming|schedules]] so that they could be available to watch their shows at their time of broadcast. The term ''appointment television'' was coined by marketers to describe this kind of attachment.

The viewership's dependence on schedule lessened with the invention of programmable video recorders, such as the [[videocassette recorder]] and the [[digital video recorder]]. Consumers could watch programs on their own schedule once they were broadcast and recorded. More recently, television service providers also offer [[video on demand]], a set of programs that can be watched at any time.

Both [[mobile phone]] networks and the [[Internet]] can give us video streams, and video sharing websites have become popular. In addition, the jumps in processing power within smartphone and tablet devices has facilitated uptake of "hybridised" TV viewing, where viewers simultaneously watch programs on TV sets and interact with online social networks via their mobile devices. A 2012 study by Australian media company [[Yahoo!7]] found 36% of Australians will call or text family and friends and 41% will post on Facebook while watching TV.&lt;ref name="BT"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kennedy, Jessica |title=Social TV on the rise |date=10 February 2012 |url=http://www.bandt.com.au/news/social-tv-on-the-rise |publisher=B&amp;T Online |accessdate=16 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121230223426/http://www.bandt.com.au/news/social-tv-on-the-rise |archivedate=30 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahoo!7 has already experienced significant early uptake of its Fango mobile app, which encourages social sharing and discussion of TV programs on Australian free-to-air networks.

The Japanese manufacturer Scalar has developed a very small TV system attached to eyeglasses, called "Teleglass T3-F".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSSP849520070522 |title=Watch TV anywhere on tiny set that fits on glasses |date=May 22, 2007 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constitutional psychology''' is a now neglected theory, also developed by Sheldon in the 1940s, which attempted to associate his somatotype classifications with human [[temperament]] types.&lt;ref name="Rafter2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rafter |first1= N |title= Somatotyping, antimodernism, and the production of criminological knowledge |journal= [[Criminology (journal)|Criminology]] |volume= 45 |issue= 4 |year= 2008 |pages= 805–33 |doi= 10.1111/j.1745-9125.2007.00092.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Penguin | isbn = 9780141030241 | title = The Penguin Dictionary of Psychology | chapter = Constitutional Theory | date = 2009 |via= [[Credo Reference]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of these ideas originated with [[Francis Galton]] and [[eugenics]].&lt;ref name="Vertinsky2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vertinsky |first= P |year= 2007 |journal= Canadian Bulletin of Medical History |volume= 24 |issue= 2 |pages= 291–316 |title= Physique as destiny: William H.

In his 1954 book, ''Atlas of Men'', Sheldon categorised all possible body types according to a scale ranging from 1 to 7 for each of the three "somatotypes", where the pure "endomorph" is 7–1–1, the pure "mesomorph" 1–7–1 and the pure "ectomorph" scores 1–1–7.&lt;ref name="Sheldon1954"&gt;{{cite book |last= Sheldon |first= William Herbert |authorlink= William Herbert Sheldon |title= Atlas of Men: A Guide for Somatotyping the Adult Male at All Ages |year= 1954 |location=New York |publisher= [[Harper (publisher)|Harper]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamlesh2011"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kamlesh |first= M.L. |title= Psychology in Physical Education and Sport |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=up-Bc_E_w9UC&amp;pg=PT508 |year= 2011 |publisher= Pinnacle Technology |isbn= 9781618202482 |chapter=Ch. 15: Personality and Sport § Sheldon's Constitutional Typology}}&lt;/ref&gt; From type number, an individual's mental characteristics could supposedly be predicted.&lt;ref name="Sheldon1954"/&gt; Barbara Honeyman Heath, who was Sheldon's main assistant in compiling ''Atlas of Men'', accused him of falsifying the data he used in writing the book.&lt;ref name= "Vertinsky2007"/&gt;

==The three types==
Sheldon's "somatotypes" and their associated physical and psychological traits were characterized as follows:&lt;ref name="Roeckelein1998"&gt;{{cite book |last= Roeckelein |first= Jon E. |title= Dictionary of Theories, Laws, and Concepts in Psychology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6mu3DLkyGfUC&amp;pg=PA427 |year= 1998 |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood]] |isbn= 9780313304606 |pages= 427–8 |chapter= Sheldon's Type Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamlesh2011"/&gt;

[[File:Bodytypes.jpg|thumb|Comparison of body types]]

*Ectomorphic: characterized as linear, thin, usually tall, fragile, lightly muscled, flat chested and delicate; described as cerebrotonic (intellectual), inclined to desire isolation, solitude and concealment; and being self aware, tense, anxious, restrained in posture and movement, introverted and secretive.&lt;ref name="Roeckelein1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamlesh2011"/&gt;
*Mesomorphic: characterized as hard, rugged, triangular, athletically built with well developed muscles, thick skin and good posture; described as somatotonic, inclined towards physical adventure and risk taking; and being vigorous, courageous, assertive, direct and dominant.&lt;ref name="Roeckelein1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamlesh2011"/&gt;
*Endomorphic: characterized as round, usually short and soft with under-developed muscles and having difficulty losing weight; described as viscerotonic (sociable), enjoying food, people and affection; having slow reactions; and being disposed to complacency.&lt;ref name="Roeckelein1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamlesh2011"/&gt;

===Stereotyping===
There is evidence that different physiques carry [[ethnic stereotype|cultural stereotypes]]. For example, one study found that endomorphs are likely to be perceived as slow, sloppy, and lazy. Mesomorphs, in contrast, are typically stereotyped as popular and hardworking, whereas ectomorphs are often viewed as intelligent but fearful and usually take part in long distance sports, such as marathon running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1177/0146167289152011 |title= Male and female raters' stereotyping of male and female physiques |journal= [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] |volume= 15 |issue= 2 |pages= 244–51 |year= 1989 |last1= Ryckman |first1= RM |last2= Robbins |first2= MA |last3= Kaczor |first3= LM |last4= Gold |first4= JA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heath-Carter Formula==
Though the psychological bindings have largely been neglected, Sheldon's physical taxonomy has persisted, particularly the Heath-Carter variant of the methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Anthropometrica: A Textbook of Body Measurement for Sports and Health Courses| first1= Kevin |last= Norton| first2= Tim |last2= Olds| publisher= Australian Sports Commission; UNSW Press| year= 1996| isbn= 978-0868402239}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formulaic approach utilises an individual's: weight (kg), height (cm), upper arm circumference (cm), maximal calf circumference (cm), femur breadth (cm), humerus breadth (cm), triceps skinfold (mm), subscapular skinfold (mm), supraspinal skinfold (mm), and medial calf skinfold (mm), and remains popular in anthropomorphic research, as to quote Rob Rempel "With modifications by Parnell in the late 1950s, and by Heath and Carter in the mid 1960s somatotype has continued to be the best single qualifier of total body shape".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= A Modified Somatotype Assessment Methodology| last= Rempel| first= R| year= 1994| publisher= Simon Fraser University| isbn= 978-0-612-06785-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variant utilizes the following series of equations to assess a subject's traits against each of the three somatotypes, each assessed on a seven-point scale, with 0 indicating no correlation and a 7 a very strong:

*''Endomorphy'':  = &lt;math&gt;-0.7182 + (0.145 * X) - (0.00068 * X^2) + (0.0000014* X^3)&lt;/math&gt;
** where:&lt;math&gt;X  = (tricepSkinfoldMM + subscapularSkinfoldMM + supraspinalSkinfoldMM) * (\frac{170.18} {heightCM})&lt;/math&gt;
*''Mesomorphy'': =  &lt;math&gt;(0.858 * HumerusBreadthCM) + (0.601 * FemurBreadthCM) + (0.188 * upperArmGirthCM) + (0.161 * maxCalfGirthCM) - (0.131 * heightCM) + 4.5&lt;/math&gt;
*''Ectomorphy '': Calculate the subjects [[corpulence index|Ponderal Index]]: &lt;math&gt;\text{PI}=\frac{height [cm]}{(mass [kg])^{1/3}}&lt;/math&gt;
** If &lt;math&gt;PI &gt; 40.74&lt;/math&gt;,  ''Ectomorphy'' = &lt;math&gt;(0.732 * PI) - 28.58&lt;/math&gt;
** If &lt;math&gt;39.65 &lt; PI &lt; 40.74&lt;/math&gt;, ''Ectomorphy'' = &lt;math&gt;(0.463 * PI) - 17.615&lt;/math&gt; 
** If &lt;math&gt;PI &lt; 39.65&lt;/math&gt;, ''Ectomorphy'' = &lt;math&gt;0.5&lt;/math&gt;

This numerical approach has gone on to be incorporated in the current [[sports science]] and [[physical education]] curriculums of numerous institutions, ranging from the UK's secondary level GCSE curriculums (14- to 16-year-olds), the Indian UPSC Civil Service exams, to MSc programs worldwide, and has been utilized in numerous academic papers, including:

==Criticism==
Sheldon's ideas that body type was an indicator of temperament, moral character or potential&amp;mdash;while popular in an atmosphere accepting of the theories of eugenics&amp;mdash;were soon widely vilified.&lt;ref name= "Vertinsky2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Wiley | isbn = 9780471678021 | title = Encyclopedia of Special Education: A Reference for the Education of Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Disabilities and Other Exceptional Individuals | chapter = Body Type | date = 2007 | chapterurl = http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileyse/body_type/0 |via= [[Credo Reference]] |subscription= yes |accessdate= 2014-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal criticism of Sheldon's constitutional theory was that it was not a theory at all but one general assumption, continuity between structure and behavior, and a set of descriptive concepts to measure physique and behavior in a scaled manner.&lt;ref name="Roeckelein1998"/&gt;

His use of thousands of [[Ivy League nude posture photos|photographs of naked Ivy League undergraduates]], obtained without explicit consent, from a pre-existing program evaluating student posture, has been described as scandalous, and perverted ("the study of nude people by lewd people").&lt;ref name= "Vertinsky2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-rosenbaum"/&gt;

His original visual assessment methodology, based on the photographs, has also been criticized as subjective.&lt;ref name= "Vertinsky2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roeckelein1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Genovese2008"/&gt;

His original thesis has also been described as fraudulent for knowingly failing to acknowledge/account for body shape changing with age.&lt;ref name= "Vertinsky2007"/&gt;

His suggestion of a genetic link to both body shape and personality traits has also been described as objectional.&lt;ref name= "Genovese2008"/&gt;

Sheldon's work has also been criticized as being heavily burdened by his own stereotypical and discriminatory views.&lt;ref name= "Vertinsky2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Rafter2008"/&gt;

'''Spread the Word to End the Word''' is a United States national campaign to encourage people to pledge to stop using the word ''[[Mental retardation|retard]]''.

End the [[Retard (pejorative)|"R" word]] advocates believe the use of the word “retard” in colloquial and everyday speech is hurtful and dehumanizing to individuals with special needs. According to R-word.org,  "The R-word hurts because it is exclusive. It's offensive. It's derogatory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.r-word.org/r-word-why-pledge.aspx#.WpYHOGaZOqA|title=Special Olympics: Why Pledge|website=www.r-word.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They advocate for the use of language that respects the dignity of people with mental disabilities. Advocates believe individuals with cognitive disabilities are capable of enjoying life’s experiences and that causal references to the words ''retard'' or ''retarded'' makes a person with intellectual disabilities feel "less than human."

==History==
The Spread the Word to End the Word movement was established in 2009 during the Special Olympics Global Youth Activation Summit at the [[2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games]]. The Spread the Word to End the Word movement was created by youth with and without intellectual disabilities.  According to the Special Olympics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“The motivation for the campaign was driven by a united passion to promote the positive contributions people with intellectual disabilities make to communities around the world combined with a simple call to action that also symbolizes positive attitude change and a commitment to make the world a more accepting place for all people.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.specialolympics.org/03-31-09_Spread_the_Word.aspx | title=Spread the Word to End the Word | publisher=Special Olympics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On March 31, 2009 the campaign celebrated the 1st Annual Spread the Word to End the Word National Awareness Day. Across the country, students of all ages made a pledge to eliminate "[[Mental retardation|retard]]" from their vocabulary and encourage others to do the same. In 2010, the 2nd Annual Spread the Word to End the Word National Day of Awareness took place on March 3, 2010.

In January 2010, the news of the past summer use of "retards" by White House chief of staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] to describe liberal groups planning attack ads on Democrats was reported in the Wall Street Journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chief of Staff Draws Fire From Left as Obama Falters|author=PETER WALLSTEN|date=2010-01-26|work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703808904575025030384695158|accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Emanuel's apologizing to [[Tim Shriver]], chief executive of the Special Olympics.  A meeting was held with Emanuel, who was asked to visit www.r-word.org, and he promised to take the R-word pledge.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">In South Africa, a '''tenderpreneur''' is a person in government or private sector who obtains private or government [[tendering|tender]]s and contracts to facilitate outsourced services.  The word ''tenderpreneur'' is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[tendering]]" and "[[entrepreneur]]". Some commentators believe that this practice might give rise to a [[kleptocracy]] as a deviant mutation of a democracy if left unchecked. In this regard a kleptocracy is defined at the condition arising when a political elite manipulate the three arms of government (legislature, executive and judiciary) with the intention of capturing resources that will enrich that elite,&lt;ref&gt;Turton, A.R [http://www.shakinghandswithbilly.comShaking Hands with Billy]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} Durban: Just Done Publications. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; a general phenomenon known as [[elite capture]]. 

''[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]'', a South African newspaper describes a tenderpreneur as "someone politically well-connected who has got rich through the government tendering system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article318330.ece|title=How Malema made his millions|publisher=''[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]''|date=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, [[South African Communist Party]] leader [[Blade Nzimande]] called for transparency in the awarding of tenders, saying "let's be bold, let's go and promote small entrepreneurs and defeat tenderpreneurs, those who steal."&lt;ref&gt;Mahlangu, Dominic.

==History==
===Ottoman era (1515–1830)===
[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[admiral]], was the founder of the [[Regency of Algiers]] (Ottoman Algeria).]]
The foundation of [[Ottoman Algeria]] was directly linked to the establishment of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province ([[Beylerbeylik (Ottoman Empire)|beylerbeylik]]) of the [[Maghreb]] at the beginning of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=325"&gt;{{citation |last=Shuval|first=Tal |year=2000|title=The Ottoman Algerian Elite and Its Ideology|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=32|issue=3|page=325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, fearing that their city would fall into [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] hands, the inhabitants of [[Algiers]] called upon Ottoman [[Privateer|corsairs]] for help.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=325"/&gt; Headed by [[Oruç Reis]] and his brother [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], they took over the rule of the city and started to expand their territory into the surrounding areas. Sultan [[Selim I]] (r. 1512-20) agreed to assume control of the Maghreb regions ruled by Hayreddin as a province, granting the rank of governor-general ([[beylerbey]]) to Hayreddin. In addition, the Sultan sent 2,000 janissaries, accompanied by about 4,000 volunteers to the newly established Ottoman province of the Maghreb, whose capital was to be the city of Algiers.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=325"/&gt; These Turks, mainly from [[Anatolia]], called each other "yoldaş" (a [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word meaning "comrade") and called their sons born of unions with local women "[[Kouloughlis|Kuloğlu’s]]", implying that they considered their children's status as that of the Sultan's servants.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=325"/&gt; Likewise, to indicate in the registers that a certain person is an offspring of a Turk and a local woman, the note "ibn al-turki" (or "kuloglu") was added to his name.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=328"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shuval|2000|loc=328}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exceptionally high number of Turks greatly affected the character of the city of [[Algiers]], and that of the province at large. In 1587, the province was divided into three different provinces, which were established where the modern states of [[Algeria]], [[Libya]] and [[Tunisia]], were to emerge. Each of these provinces was headed by a [[Pasha]] sent from [[Constantinople]] for a three-year term. The division of the Maghreb launched the process that led eventually to the janissary corps' rule over the province.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=326"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shuval|2000|loc=326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of the 16th century, Algiers's Ottoman elite chose to emphasize its Turkish identity and nurture its Turkish character to a point at which it became an ideology.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=326"/&gt; By so doing, the Algerian province took a different path from that of its neighboring provinces, where local-Ottoman elites were to emerge. The aim of nurturing the elite's Turkishness was twofold: it limited the number of the privileged group (the ocak) while demonstrating the group's loyalty to the Sultan.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=326"/&gt; By the 18th century there was 50,000 janissaries concentrated in the city of Algiers alone.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=326"/&gt;

The lifestyle, language, religion, and area of origin of the Ottoman elite's members created remarkable differences between the Algerian Ottoman elite and the indigenous population.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=327"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shuval|2000|loc=327}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, members of the elite adhered to [[Hanafi]] law while the rest of the population subscribed to the [[Maliki school]].&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=327"/&gt; Most of the elites originated from non-Arab regions of the Empire. Furthermore, most members of the elite spoke [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] while the local population spoke [[Algerian Arabic]] and even differed from the rest of the population in their dress.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=327"/&gt;

==== Recruiting the military-administrative elite ====
From its establishment, the military-administrative elite worked to reinvigorate itself by enlisting volunteers from non-Arab regions of the [[Ottoman Empire]], mainly from [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=328"/&gt; Hence, local recruiting of [[Arabs]] was almost unheard of and during the 18th century a more or less permanent network of recruiting officers was kept in some coastal Anatolian cities and on some of the islands of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=329"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shuval|2000|loc=329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The recruitment policy was therefore one of the means employed to perpetuate the Turkishness of the Ottoman elite and was practiced until the fall of the province in 1830.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=329"/&gt;

====Marriages to local women and the Kuloğlus====
[[File:Hadj Ahmed Bey el kolli.jpg|thumb|right|Contrary to all custom, [[Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Chérif]] - a [[kouloughli]] - was the last Ottoman [[Bey]] of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], in the [[Regency of Algiers]], ruling from 1826 to 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Alexis Tocqueville, ''Second Letter on Algeria (August 22, 1837)'', Bronner, Stephen Eric; Thompson, Michael (eds.), '''The Logos Reader: Rational Radicalism and the Future of Politics''', (University of Kentucky Press, 2006), 205;"''This bey, contrary to all custom, was coulougli, meaning the son of a Turkish father and an Arab mother.''"&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
During the 18th century, the militia practiced a restrictive policy on marriages between its members and local women. A married soldier would lose his right of residence in one of the city's eight barracks and the daily ration of bread to which he was entitled. He would also lose his right to purchase a variety of products at a preferential price.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=329"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shuval|2000|loc=329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the militia's marriage policy made clear distinctions among holders of different ranks: the higher the rank, the more acceptable the marriage of its holder.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=330"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shuval|2000|loc=330}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy can be understood as part of the Ottoman elite's effort to perpetuate its Turkishness and to maintain its segregation from the rest of the population.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=330"/&gt; Furthermore, the militia's marriage policy, in part, emerged from fear of an increase in the number of the kuloğlus.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=331"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shuval|2000|loc=331}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kouloughlis|kuloğlu’s]] refers to the male offspring of members of the Ottoman elite and the local Algerian women.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=331"/&gt; Due to their link to the local Algerian population via his maternal family, the kuloğlus' loyalty to the Ottoman elite was suspected because of the fear that they might develop another loyalty; they were therefore considered a potential danger to the elite.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=331"/&gt; However, the son of a non-local woman, herself an "outsider" in the local population, represented no such danger to the Ottoman elite. Therefore, the Algerian Ottoman elite had a clear policy dictating the perpetuation of its character as a special social group separated from the local population.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=331"/&gt;

Nonetheless, John Douglas Ruedy points out that the kuloğlu’s also sought to protect their Turkishness: 
{{quote|"Proud and distinctive appearing, Kouloughlis often pretended to speak only [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and insisted on worshipping in [[Hanafi]] [i.e. Ottoman-built] mosques with men of their own ethnic background. In times of emergency they were called upon to supplement the forces of the ojaq."&lt;ref name="Ruedy 2005 loc=35"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ruedy|2005|loc=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the neighbouring province of Tunisia, the maintenance of the Turkishness of the ruling group was not insisted upon, and the kuloğlus could reach the highest ranks of government. However, the janissary corps had lost its supremacy first to the [[Muradid dynasty]] (Murad Bey's son was appointed bey), and then to the [[Husainid Dynasty]]. The Tunisian situation partly explains the continuation of the Algerian janissary corps' recruitment policy and the manifest will to distance the kuloğlus from the real centres of power.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=332"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shuval|2000|loc=332}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, high-ranking kuloğlus were in the service of the ocak, in military and in administrative capacities, occupying posts explicitly considered out of bounds for them; although there were no kuloğlus who was [[dey]] during the 18th century, this seems to be the only exception.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=333"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shuval|2000|loc=333}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Algeria came under French colonial rule in 1830, approximately 10,000 Turks were expelled and shipped off to [[Smyrna]]; moreover, many Turks (alongside other natives) fled to other regions of the Ottoman realms, particularly to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria (region)|Syria]], [[Arabia]], and [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Kateb 2001 loc=50-51"&gt;{{citation |last=Kateb|first=Kamel|year=2001|title=Européens: "Indigènes" et juifs en Algérie (1830-1962) : Représentations et Réalités des Populations|publisher=[[INED]]|isbn=273320145X|pages=50–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, by 1832, many Algerian-Turkish descended families, who had not left Algeria, joined a coalition with [[Emir Abdelkader]] in order to forge the beginning of a powerful resistance movement against French colonial rule.&lt;ref name="Knauss 1987 loc=19"/&gt;

In 1926 [[Messali Hadj]] - an Algerian of Turkish origin - founded the first modern nationalist movement for [[Algerian independence]].&lt;ref name="Ness 2016 loc=634"/&gt; Another prominent Algerian nationalist leader of Turkish origin was [[Ahmed Tewfik El Madani]]&lt;ref name="McDougall 2006 loc=158"/&gt; who, as the leader of the [[Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema]], continued to influence Algerian nationalism. Ahmed Tewfik was also a historian who argued that the Turkish era in Algeria was defamed by European historians and provided the French with convincing arguments to justify their colonial actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Shinar|first=Pessah|year=2004|chapter=The Historical Approach of the Reformist ‘Ulama’ in the Contemporary Maghrib|title=Modern Islam in the Maghrib|place=|publisher=[[Max Schloessinger Memorial Foundation]]|isbn=9657258022|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that the Ottoman Turks had unified Algeria's territory and saved the country from the grip of [[Christianity]] as well as from the fate of [[Muslim Spain]]. Furthermore, he stated that the Turks who settled in Algeria were "perfection and nobility itself" and emphasised their contributions to Algerian society, such as the establishment of religious endowments, mosques and waterworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pessah|2004|loc=205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1956 the Reformist Ulema, under the leadership of Ahmed Tewfik, joined the Algerian National Liberation Front to fight for Algerian independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Singh|first=K.R|year=2013|chapter=North Africa|editor-last=Ayoob|editor-first=Mohammed|title=The Politics of Islamic Reassertion |place=|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1134611102|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algerian Republican era (1962–present)===
In 2011 Algerian journalist Mustafa Dala reported in the "''[[Echorouk El Yawmi]]''" that Algerians of Turkish origin - particularly the youth - are seeking to revive the [[Turkish language]] in Algeria. In his investigation, Dala found that the Turkish minority are already distinguishable by their different customs, especially in regards to clothes and foods, as well as by their Turkish surnames. However, he states that the revival of the Turkish language is a sign of the minority restoring their identity and highlights the "new Ottomans" in Algeria.&lt;ref name=Djazairess&gt;{{cite web|last=Dala|first=Mustafa|year=2011|title=جزايرس : عائلات جزائرية ترغب في إحياء هويتها التركية|url=http://www.djazairess.com/echorouk/69258|publisher=[[Echorouk El Yawmi]]|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Common surnames used by the Turkish minority====
[[File:Bashtarzi.jpg|thumb|right|The singer, actor, and writer [[Mahieddine Bachtarzi]] was of Turkish origin.&lt;ref name="Bencheneb"/&gt; His surname "Bachtarzi" is a Turkish origin surname (''"Baş Terzi"'') meaning "chief tailor".&lt;ref name="Parzymies 1985 loc=43"/&gt;]]

==Culture==
[[File:Turkish women of Algeria (1876-1888).jpg|thumb|right|Turkish women of Algeria in their traditional dress (c. 1876 – 1888).]]
[[File:Ketchaoua Mosque restoration (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ketchaoua Mosque]] ({{lang-tr|Keçiova Camii}}&lt;ref name=Yenişehirlioğlu&gt;{{citation |last=Yenişehirlioğlu|first=Filiz|year=1989|title=Ottoman architectural works outside Turkey|page=34|publisher=T.C. Dışişleri Bakanlığı|isbn=9759550105}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Algiers]] was built in 1612 by the Ottoman Turks. It was recently restored by the Turkish government.]]

The Algerian Turks generally take pride in their Ottoman-Turkish heritage but also have integrated successfully into Algerian society. Their identity is based on their ethnic [[Turkish people|Turkish]] roots and links to mainland [[Turkey]] but also to the customs, language, and local culture of Algeria.&lt;ref name=slateafrique&gt;{{cite web|author=Slate Afrique|title=Que reste-t-il des Turcs et des Français en Algérie?|url=http://www.slateafrique.com/81641/turcs-francais-algerie-colonisation-histoire|accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the three centuries of Turkish rule in Algeria, today many cultural (particularly in regards to food, religion, and dress - and to a lesser extent language), architectural, as well as musical elements of Algeria are of Turkish origin or influence.&lt;ref name=slateafrique/&gt;

===Language===
During the Ottoman era, the [[Ottoman Turkish language]] was the official governing language in the region, and the [[Turkish language]] was spoken mostly by the Algerian Turkish community.&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=327"/&gt; However, today most Algerian Turks speak the [[Arabic language]] as their mother tongue. Nonetheless, the legacy of the Turkish language is still apparent and has influenced many words and vocabulary in Algeria. An estimated 634 Turkish words are still used in Algeria today.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Benrabah|first=Mohamed|year=2007|chapter= The Language Planning Situation in Algeria|title=Language Planning and Policy in Africa, Vol 2|place=|publisher=Multilingual Matters|page=49|isbn=1847690114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in [[Algerian Arabic]] it is possible for a single sentence to include an Arabic subject, a French verb, and for the predicate to be in Berber or Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=|first=|year=2006|title=Algerian patois delights and disturbs|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/08/200841013358962576.html|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, families of Turkish origin have retained their Turkish family surnames; common names include Barbaros, Hayreddin, Osmanî, Stambouli, Torki, Turki, and Uluçali; job titles or functions have also become family names within the Algerian-Turkish community (such as Hazneci, Demirci, Başterzi, Silahtar).&lt;ref name=slateafrique/&gt;&lt;ref name=alturkiyya&gt;{{cite web|author=Al Turkiyya|title=Cezayir deki Türkiye|url=http://www.alturkiyya.com/tr/detay_liste.asp?yazi=213|accessdate=2013-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927145548/http://www.alturkiyya.com/tr/detay_liste.asp?yazi=213|archivedate=2013-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pasha mosque Oran.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Hassan Basha Mosque|Hassan Pasha Mosque]] ({{lang-tr|Paşa Camii}}&lt;ref name=Yenişehirlioğlu/&gt;) in [[Oran]] was built in 1797 by the Ottoman Turks.]]

===Religion===
The Ottoman Turks brought the teaching of the [[Hanafi]] law of [[Sunni Islam]] to Algeria; consequently, their lifestyle created remarkable differences between the Ottoman Turks and the indigenous population because the ethnic Arabs and Berbers practiced the [[Maliki school]].&lt;ref name="Shuval 2000 loc=327"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{citation |last1=Gordon|first1=Louis A.|last2=Oxnevad|first2=Ian|year=2016|title=Middle East Politics for the New Millennium: A Constructivist Approach|page=72|publisher=[[Lexington Books]]|quote=An Ottoman military class that separated itself from the general Algerian population through language, dress and religious affiliation... Unlike the Maliki Algerian masses, the Ottoman-Algerians remained affiliated with the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, and went to great lengths to replenish their ranks with Ottoman Turks from Anatolia...|isbn=0739196987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Hanafi school is still practiced among the Turkish descended families. Moreover, the Ottoman mosques in Algeria - which are still used by the Turkish minority -  are distinguishable by their octagonal minarets which were built in accordance with the traditions of the Hanafi rite.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Cantone|first1=Cleo|year=2002|title=Making and Remaking Mosques in Senegal|quote=Octagonal minarets are generally an anomaly in the Maliki world associated with the square tower.

The resulting structures had octagonal minarets...|page=28|publisher=Parkstone International|isbn=1780429932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
Today the Turkish heritage in Algeria is most notably present in their [[Turkish cuisine|cuisine]] which they have introduced to Algeria (such as [[Turkish coffee]], [[Lahmacun]], [[Börek]]'s, desserts and pastries).&lt;ref name=slateafrique/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Oakes|first=Jonathan|year=2008|title=Bradt Travel Guide: Algeria|page=23|publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]]|isbn=184162232X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===Population===
The Turkish minority is estimated to form between 5%&lt;ref name="OBG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamm"/&gt; to 25%&lt;ref name="sputnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hizmetli1953/&gt; of Algeria's total population, the latter including those of partial Turkish origin.

In 1993 the Turkish scholar Prof. Dr. Metin Akar estimated that there was 1 million Turks living in Algeria.&lt;ref name="Akar"&gt;{{citation|last=Akar|first=Metin|year=1993|title=Fas Arapçasında Osmanlı Türkçesinden Alınmış Kelimeler|journal=Türklük Araştırmaları Dergisi|publisher=|volume=7|issue=|pages=94–95|quote=Günümüzde, Arap dünyasında hâlâ Türk asıllı aileler mevcuttur.

Bu ailelerin varlığı da Arap lehçelerindeki Türkçe ödünçleşmeleri belki artırmış olabilir.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008 a country report of Algeria by the Oxford Business Group stated that 5% of Algeria's 34.8 million inhabitants were of Turkish descent (accounting to 1.74 million).&lt;ref name="OBG"/&gt; In the same year, a report by the Turkish Embassy in Algeria stated that there was between 600,000-700,000 people of Turkish origin living in Algeria; however, the Turkish Embassy report also stated that according to the French Embassy's records there was around 2 million Turks in Algeria.&lt;ref name="turkishembassy"&gt;{{citation|last=Turkish Embassy in Algeria|first=|year=2008|title=Cezayir Ülke Raporu 2008|place=|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|page=4|quote=Bunun dışında, büyük bir bölümü Tlemcen şehri civarında bulunan ve Osmanlı döneminde buraya gelip yerleşen 600-700 bin Türk kökenli kişinin yaşadığı bilinmektedir.

In recent years, several Turkish academics,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Özkan|first1=Fadime|year=2015|title=Deneme Bir İki|page=475|publisher=Okur Kitaplığı|quote=Cezayir'de Türk rakamlarına göre 600 bin, Fransız rakamlarına göre 2 milyon Türk asıllı Cezayirlinin yaşadığını...|isbn=6054877941}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Turkish official reports,&lt;ref name="SGDB"/&gt; have reiterated that estimates of the Turkish population range between 600,000 and 2 million. However, a 2010 report published by the Directorate General for Strategy Development points out that these estimates are likely to be low because 1 million Turks migrated and settled in Algeria throughout the 315 years of Ottoman rule. Moreover, the report suggests that due to intermarriages with the local population, 30% of Algeria's population was of Turkish origin in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="SGDB"&gt;{{citation |last=Strateji Geliştirme Daire Başkanlığı|year=2010|title=Sosyo-Ekonomik Açıdan Cezayir|url=http://www.gtb.gov.tr/data/51d55f17487c8e0f30a44f5a/gumrukbulteni3.pdf|journal=Gümrük ve Ticaret Bülteni|publisher=Strateji Geliştirme Daire Başkanlığı|issue=3|page=35|quote=Bu sistem ile Osmanlı İmparatorluğunun bu topraklarda hüküm sürdüğü yaklaşık üç yüzyıllık sürede, bir milyon Türk genci Cezayir’e gönderilmiştir.

By 2013 the [[United States|American]] historian Dr. Niki Gamm argued that the total population of Turkish origin remains unclear and that estimates range between 5-10% of Algeria's population of 37 million (accounting to between 1.85 million and 3.7 million)&lt;ref name="Gamm"&gt;{{citation |last=Gamm|first=Niki|year=2013|title=The Keys to Oran|publisher=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/the-keys-to-oran.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=59524&amp;NewsCatID=438|quote=How many there are in today’s population is unclear.

[[File:Tlemcen vue générale 1.jpg|thumb|right|The Turkish minority mainly live in the big cities of Algeria.&lt;ref name="OBG"/&gt; For example, they have a strong presence in [[Tlemcen]] where they live within their own sectors of the city.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;]]

Since the Ottoman era, urban society in the coastal cities of Algeria evolved into an ethnic mix of Turks and Kouloughlis as well as other ethnic groups (Arabs, Berbers, Moors, and Jews).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Stone|first=Martin|year=1997|title=The Agony of Algeria|place=|publisher=C.

Indeed, today, the descendants of Ottoman-Turkish settlers continue to live in the big cities.&lt;ref name="OBG"/&gt; In particular, the Turks have traditionally had a strong presence in the [[Tlemcen Province]]; alongside the Moors, they continue to make up a significant portion of [[Tlemcen]]'s population and live within their own sectors of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Appiah|first1=Anthony|last2=Gates|first2=Henry Louis|year=2010|title=Encyclopedia of Africa, Volume 1|page=475|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-533770-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{citation |last=Britannica|first=|year=2012|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/597513/Tlemcen|title=Tlemcen|place=|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]].

===Diaspora===
There are many Algerian Turks who have emigrated to other countries and hence make up part of Algeria's diaspora. Initially, the first wave of migration occurred in 1830 when many Turks were forced to leave the region once the French took control over Algeria; approximately 10,000 were shipped off to [[Turkey]] whilst many others migrated to other regions of the [[Ottoman Empire]], including [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]], [[Arabia]], and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Kateb 2001 loc=50-51"/&gt; Furthermore, some Turkish/Kouloughli families also settled in [[Morocco]] (such as in [[Tangier]] and [[Tétouan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Koroghli|first=Ammar|year=2010|title=EL DJAZAÎR : De la Régence à l'Istiqlal|url=http://www.setif.info/article4519.html|publisher=Sétif Info}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the formerly independent [[Municipalities of the canton of Zürich|municipality]] [[Wipkingen]], the church hall (German: ''Kirchgemeindehaus'') „Haus für das Volk“, meaning ''home for the people'', was inaugurated in 1932, being the parish house of the Reformed church congregation, that is independent since 1865.&lt;ref name="ta-20141223"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/stadt/Sie-wollen-uns-den-Glauben-zurueckbringen/story/14736389|title=Sie wollen uns den Glauben zurückbringen|publisher=[[Tages-Anzeiger]]|author=Michael Meier|language=German|date=2014-12-23|accessdate=2014-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and background ==
About 60 religious associations have been established by or for immigrants in Zürich in the past 20 years. In order to offer appropriate cult rooms, in 2008 the [[Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Zürich]] respectively of the city of Zürich established the centre in Wipkingen. The theologian and pastor Dinah Hess is as of December 2014 its director, she tries also to find rooms for further parishes, and she is responsible for the rental of rooms and the communal life in the center. Pastor Hess also obliges the communication to the migration churches, and to aware that the Reformed Church sometimes may have a different understanding of mission between the registered partnership, and therefore not to deny, but to carefully address debates on such topics.
