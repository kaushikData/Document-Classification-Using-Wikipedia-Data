The '''107th [[Grey Cup]]''' &lt;ref name=global-shawgreycupdeal&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaw, CFL announce Grey Cup sponsorship deal|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1988297/shaw-cfl-announce-grey-cup-sponsorship-deal/|accessdate=Nov 29, 2017|work=Global News|publisher=Shaw Media|date=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; will be played to decide the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) championship for the [[2019 CFL season|2019 season]]. The game will be televised in [[Canada]] nationally on [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[Réseau des sports|RDS]]. The game is scheduled to be played on November 24, 2019 at [[McMahon Stadium]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name="Announcement"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=press.cfl.ca| url=https://press.cfl.ca/107th-grey-cup-presented-by-shaw-coming-to-calgary-in-2019 | title=107th Grey Cup presented by Shaw coming to Calgary in 2019 | date=April 25, 2018 | accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be the fifth time that Calgary has hosted the Grey Cup, with the most recent coming in [[97th Grey Cup|2009]].&lt;ref name="Announcement"/&gt;

==Date==
On November 24, 2017, at the CFL's State of the League address, League Commissioner [[Randy Ambrosie]] stated that he was going to explore the possibility of having the Grey Cup during the third week of October.&lt;ref name="October"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Ottawa Sun| url=http://ottawasun.com/sports/football/cfl/grey-cup-in-october-tv-deal-with-nfl-cfl-commish-speaks | title=Grey Cup in October? NFL Network TV deal could follow for CFL | date=November 24, 2017 | accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons in favour of this were the weather being warmer in October as well as a potential television deal with the American-based [[NFL Network]].&lt;ref name="October"/&gt; Reasons against would be the increased overlap of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] in May and June (since the season would also have to start one month earlier) as well as the CFL's playoffs overlapping [[Major League Baseball]]'s playoffs in October.&lt;ref name="October"/&gt; It was ultimately scheduled for its usual date (fourth Sunday of November) and will take place on November 24, 2019.

==Host city==
Leading up to the formal announcement, the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] and the [[Calgary Stampeders]] were the only clubs that publicly expressed interest in hosting the game.&lt;ref name="spec"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Hamilton Spectator| url=http://www.thespec.com/sports-story/7208036-no-grey-cup-bid-until-stadium-legal-issues-solved/ | title=No Grey Cup bid until stadium legal issues solved | date=March 24, 2017 | accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Calgary Sun| url=http://calgarysun.com/sports/football/stampeders-looking-good-to-host-2019-grey-cup | title=Stampeders looking good to host 2019 Grey Cup | date=March 23, 2018 | accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tiger-Cats' stadium, [[Tim Hortons Field]] was completed in 2014, but the city of Hamilton had not hosted a Grey Cup since the [[84th Grey Cup]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chch.com/tim-hortons-field-finally-finished-but-hamilton-officials-low-key/|title=Tim Hortons Field finally finished, but Hamilton officials low-key|website=Chch.com|accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/the-high-cost-of-pan-am-what-legacy-will-hamiltons-new-stadium-leave-behind/article25270287/|title=The high cost of Pan Am: What legacy will Hamilton's new stadium leave behind?|website=Theglobeandmail.com|accessdate=November 29, 2017|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main obstacle had been that multiple levels of government and the Tiger-Cats themselves have filed lawsuits against the construction firm due to the stadium construction delays and ongoing maintenance issues with the stadium itself.&lt;ref name="spec"/&gt; The club would also need support from [[Hamilton, Ontario City Council|Hamilton City Council]].&lt;ref name="spec"/&gt; Temporary seating would have to be installed with the goal to raise seating capacity to 40,000.&lt;ref name="capacity"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Hamilton Spectator| url=https://www.thespec.com/sports-story/6941944-don-t-expect-to-see-a-grey-cup-in-hamilton-before-2019/ | title=Don’t expect to see a Grey Cup in Hamilton before 2019 | date=November 2, 2016 | accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger-Cats CEO, Scott Mitchell, had said that the team wanted to host this game in particular since it coincides with the 150th anniversary of the original [[Hamilton Tigers (Canadian football)|Hamilton Football Club]].&lt;ref name="spec"/&gt;

The '''1994 Black Hawk shootdown incident''', sometimes referred to as the '''Black Hawk Incident''', was a [[friendly fire]] incident over northern [[History of Iraq under Ba'athist rule|Iraq]] that occurred on 14 April 1994 during [[Operation Provide Comfort]] (OPC). The pilots of two [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] [[fighter aircraft]], operating under the control of a USAF [[airborne warning and control system]] (AWACS) aircraft, misidentified two [[United States Army]] [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] [[helicopters]] as Iraqi [[Mil Mi-24]] "Hind" helicopters. The F-15 pilots fired on and destroyed both helicopters, killing all 26 military and civilians aboard, including personnel from the United States, United Kingdom, France, [[Turkey]], and the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] community.

A subsequent USAF investigation blamed the accident on several factors. The F-15 pilots were faulted for misidentifying the helicopters as hostile. Also, the crew members of the AWACS aircraft were blamed for their inaction in failing to exercise appropriate control and for not intervening in the situation. In addition, the [[identification friend or foe]] (IFF) systems had not functioned to identify the helicopters to the F-15 pilots. Furthermore, USAF leaders had failed to adequately integrate U.S. Army helicopter operations into overall OPC air operations. As a result of the investigation several USAF officers received administrative discipline but only one, Jim Wang, an AWACS crew member, was tried by military court-martial, in which he was acquitted.

As a result of complaints by family members of the victims and others that the military was failing to hold its personnel accountable, the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] conducted their own investigations into the shootdown and the U.S. military's response to it. Also, [[Ronald R. Fogleman]], the USAF's new [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff]], conducted his own review of the actions taken by the USAF against the officers involved in the incident.

Fogleman's investigation led to several of the officers involved in the incident receiving further administrative discipline. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) subsequently refused U.S. Senate subpoenas for four USAF officers to be interviewed for the Senate investigation, which was never publicly released. The U.S. House investigation, conducted in part by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), found that the military investigative and judicial systems had operated mostly as designed, but also noted that the DoD had refused access to key witnesses.

==Background==
[[File:Iraq NO FLY ZONES.PNG|thumb|Map of the no-fly zones in Iraq after the Gulf War. Operation Provide Comfort took place in the northern no-fly zone, labeled as "NORTHERN NFZ" on the map]]
[[File:IncirlikAWACS.jpg|thumb|An AWACS aircraft operates out of Incirlik Air Base during OPC]]

On 7 April 1991, Iraq accepted United Nations (UN) cease-fire conditions and resolutions, thereby officially ending the [[Gulf War]]. This same day, a large multinational, multiple-agency humanitarian effort under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution No. 688 began to aid the approximately 500,000 [[Kurds|Kurdish]] refugees who had fled from Iraqi military forces into the hills of northern Iraq. On 18 April 1991, [[John Shalikashvili]] took command of the U.S.-led operation to ensure security for UN relief operations and the Kurdish refugees, called [[Operation Provide Comfort]] (OPC).&lt;ref&gt;Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 3–4, 27–29, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 143, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

OPC took place in an area of northern Iraq above the [[36th parallel north|36th parallel]]. This area, approximately {{convert|160|by|70|km}} in size, was designated a [[no-fly zone|"no-fly" security zone]] by UN coalition forces, enforced by a combined task force (CTF) of daily armed aircraft patrols from participating nations, including the United Kingdom, France, [[Turkey]], and the United States. The [[United States Army]] was tasked with assisting civilian relief agencies to build communities and facilities for the Kurds in Northern Iraq. Over the next three years, 27,000 fixed-wing and 1,400 helicopter coalition flights took place in the zone to support humanitarian operations without interference from Iraqi aircraft or other military units.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, "Copter Deaths: Pentagon Finds Human Failure", Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 7–8, 29–30, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1994 OPC was co-commanded by USAF [[Brigadier general|Brigadier General]] Jeffrey Pilkington. The OPC combined air forces were commanded by Colonel [[Curtis H. Emery]], USAF. Colonel Douglas J. Richardson, USAF, was the director of operations for the combined air forces.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 162, Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 30. The other OPC co-commander was a Turkish military general officer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
On 14 April 1994, at [[24-hour clock|07:36]] local time, a USAF [[E-3 Sentry|E-3 AWACS]] aircraft from the [[963d Airborne Air Control Squadron]] (based at [[Tinker Air Force Base]], [[Oklahoma]]) departed [[Incirlik Air Base]] (AB), Turkey in support of OPC. The AWACS, with its 19-member crew under the mission crew command of Major Lawrence Tracy, was to provide airborne threat warning and air control for all OPC aircraft during its time aloft. The AWACS crew reported on station at its assigned surveillance orbit altitude of {{convert|32000|ft|m|-1}} located inside Turkey just north of the northern border of Iraq at 08:45. The weather that day was fair and clear over northern Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 4, 46, 53–54, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 10–12, 51, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 08:22, two U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from the 6th Battalion, 159th Aviation Regiment (based in [[Giebelstadt]], Germany), called Eagle Flight, departed [[Diyarbakır]], near [[Pirinçlik Air Base]], Turkey headed for the OPC military coordination center (MCC) located {{convert|150|mi|km|-1}} away in [[Zakho|Zakhu]], Iraq. Both helicopters were fitted with external, {{convert|230|USgal|L|adj=on}} fuel tanks on sponsons mounted beside each side door with each tank emblazoned with large [[flag of the United States|American flags]]. In addition to the flags on the fuel tanks, each helicopter was marked with American flags on each side door, on the nose, and on the belly. The lead Black Hawk was piloted by U.S. Army [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] Patrick McKenna, commander of the Eagle Flight detachment of six helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;Washington, "So, Who's to Blame?", Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 76, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', p. 81, 91, 103–104. Originally, four helicopters were planned for the mission, but Turkish military authorities would only authorize two (Hall). The helicopters' call signs were Chalk 1 and Chalk 2 and their tail numbers were #88-26060 and #87-26000 (Hall).&lt;/ref&gt;

At 09:21, the Black Hawks reported their entry into the no-fly zone by radio on the en route frequency to the AWACS en route controller, Lieutenant Joseph Halcli, and then landed six minutes later at the MCC. Halcli and his superior officer, Captain Jim Wang, the AWACS's senior director, added "friendly helicopter" [[symbol|tags]] to their [[radar]] scopes, noted that both helicopters were displaying [[identification friend or foe]] (IFF) Mode I and Mode II signals, and then suspended the radar symbols after the Black Hawks disappeared from their scopes upon landing at the MCC at 09:24. Although the helicopters were squawking (signalling) the wrong IFF Mode I code for the no-fly zone (called the Tactical Area of Responsibility or TAOR), neither Wang nor Halcli informed the Black Hawk pilots of that (both helicopters, however, were squawking the correct Mode II codes). Wang and Halcli also neglected to direct the Black Hawks to begin using the TAOR radio frequency instead of the en route frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, "Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 6–21, 51, Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 4, 55, &amp; 100–101, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 278–279. Six Eagle Flight helicopters were stationed at Pirinclik. This was Wang's 60th mission over OPC. The IFF systems in use by Provide Comfort coalition aircraft used four identification signals, modes I, II, III, and IV. Mode III was not used in the TAOR (Hall).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ProvideComfortBlackHawk.jpg|thumb|left|An OPC Eagle Flight Black Hawk with external fuel tanks]]
At the MCC, the Black Hawks picked up 16 members of the UN Provide Comfort coalition leadership team including four Kurdish civilians, one [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean-Catholic]] civilian, three Turkish, two British, and one French military officers, plus five U.S. civilian and military officials. At 09:54, the helicopters departed the MCC for [[Erbil]], Iraq, a distance of {{convert|120|mi|km|-1}}. The Black Hawks reported their departure, flight route, and destinations by radio which was acknowledged by Halcli. Halcli then re-initiated the friendly helicopter track on his scope. Two of the Black Hawk passengers were [[Colonel]] Jerry Thompson, U.S. Army, commander of the MCC, and his replacement, Colonel Richard Mulhern, U.S. Army. At Arbil and later at Salah ad Din, Iraq, Thompson planned to introduce Mulhern to two prominent Kurdish leaders, [[Masoud Barzani]] and [[Jalal Talabani]], as well as to UN representatives. Halcli placed tags on his radar screen to show the two Black Hawks' track and notified Wang of the helicopters' movement. In addition to Halcli's screen, the friendly helicopter symbols were visible on the radar screens of Wang, Tracy, and USAF Major Doug Martin. Martin was the "Duke" or "ACE" airborne command element on the AWACS, meaning that he was a rated aircrew member assigned to the crew to ensure that all engagement (combat) mandates were adhered to and executed as written in OPC policies.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 6–22, 42, 51, 157, Weiner, "Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down", Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 4, 55, &amp; 100, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', p. 105. Martin was a rated navigator with 2,000 flying hours, mainly in [[General Dynamics F-111]] aircraft and had flown in the [[1986 Bombing of Libya]]. The lead helicopter's crew and passengers included:  Patrick McKenna (27), pilot, John Garrett (32), co-pilot, Jeffrey Colbert (22), crewman, Mark Ellner (21), crewman, Jerald Thompson (48), MCC commander, Richard Mulhern (43), new MCC commander, Paul Barclay (24), US Army special forces soldier, Barbara Schell (50), US State Department advisor, Harry Shapland, British military officer, Hikmet Alp, Turkish military officer, Salid Said, Kurdish representative, Barlas Gultepe, Turkish military officer, Bader Mikho, Kurdish representative, and Ahmad Mohammad, Kurdish representative (Hall, pp. 97–103).  The trail helicopter's crew and passengers included:  Michael Hall (28), pilot, Erik Mounsey (28), co-pilot, Cornelius Bass (22), crewman, Michael Robinson (23), crewman, Laura Piper (25), US Air Force officer, Benjamin Hodge (32), US Army intelligence specialist, Ricky Robinson (33), medic, Jonathan Swann, British military officer, Guy Demetz, French military officer, Ceyhun Civas, Turkish military officer, Abdulsatar Arab, Kurdish representative, Ghandi Hussein, Kurdish representative (Hall, pp. 93–97).&lt;/ref&gt;

En route to Arbil, at 10:12, the Black Hawks entered mountainous terrain and their radar returns disappeared from the AWACS's scopes. Captain Dierdre Bell, an air surveillance officer on the AWACS, noticed that the Black Hawks' radar and IFF returns had disappeared and sent an electronic "attention arrow" to Wang's scope.  Wang took no action and the large blinking green arrow automatically disappeared from his screen after one minute.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 56, 101, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 23–24, Weiner, "Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ProvideComfortF-15Incirlik.jpg|thumb|An [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighter departs Incirlik Air Base during OPC]]
Meanwhile, at 09:35, two USAF F-15C fighter aircraft from the [[53d Fighter Squadron]], piloted by Captain Eric Wickson and [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Randy W. May, departed Incirlik AB. Their mission was to perform an initial fighter sweep of the TAOR to clear the area of any hostile aircraft prior to the entry of coalition forces. The air tasking order (ATO) that was supposed to list all scheduled coalition aircraft missions for that day and which the two pilots reviewed before takeoff, mentioned that U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters would be operating in the TAOR that day but did not list takeoff times, routes, or flight durations for them. At 10:15, Wickson radioed Martin on the AWACS and asked if he had any information to pass to them to which Martin replied in the negative.&lt;ref&gt;Washington, "So, Who's to Blame?", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 25, Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 58–59, 83–86, &amp; 101. Randy May was the squadron commander of the 53rd with over 3,000 flying hours and had shot down an Iraqi Hind helicopter in northern Iraq near [[Kirkuk]] during the [[Gulf War]]. Wickson had over 1,300 flying hours with about 700 in F-15s and this was his 18th mission over OPC.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, reported entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller responsible for air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using was different from the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired to the back of the airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 4–6, 55, 60, 83–86, &amp; 101, 116, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 15–26, 51–52, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NorthernIraqTerrain.jpg|thumb|left|Northern Iraqi terrain similar to that in which the incident occurred]]
At 10:22, Wickson, flying at {{convert|27000|ft|m|-1}}, reported a radar contact on a low-flying, slow-moving aircraft {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} southeast of his current position. Wilson acknowledged Wickson's report with a "clear there" response, meaning that he had no radar contacts in that area. Unknown to the two F-15 pilots, the unidentified aircraft were the two U.S. Army Black Hawks. Contrary to standard procedure, neither Tracy nor Wang spoke up at this point to request that the AWACS crew members attempt to identify the F-15s' radar contacts.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 4, Weiner, "Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 15–27, 52, Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 4–6, 60, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both F-15 pilots then electronically interrogated the radar target with their on-board IFF systems across two different modes (Mode I and Mode IV). Their IFF systems responded negatively to the attempt to identify the contact on Mode I. The Mode IV momentarily gave a positive response, but thereafter responded negatively and the F-15s moved to intercept the unidentified aircraft. Intermittent IFF Mode I and Mode II returns from the Black Hawks now began to show on Wilson's and other AWACS crew members' scopes and friendly helicopter symbols reappeared on Wang's scope. After closing to {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} of the radar contacts, at 10:25 the F-15s again reported the contact to the AWACS and Wilson this time responded that he now had a radar contact at that reported location. Although the Black Hawk intermittent radar and now steady IFF returns on the AWACS scopes were in the same location as the unidentified contacts being tracked by the F-15s, none of the AWACS controllers advised Wickson or May that the contacts they were tracking might be friendly helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 278–279, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 26–29, 52–53, 217, Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 6, 60–62, 102, 118, Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 4, Washington, "So, Who's to Blame?".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ProvideComfortBlackHawkrear.jpg|thumb|An Eagle Flight Black Hawk as seen from the side]]
[[File:Krzesiny 91RB.JPG|thumb|An [[MI-24]] as seen from the side]]

The two F-15s now initiated a visual identification (VID) pass of the contact. The VID pass entailed violating one of OPC's [[rules of engagement]], which prohibited fighter aircraft from operating below {{convert|10000|ft|m|-1}} above the ground. At this time the two Black Hawks had entered a deep valley and were cruising at a speed of {{convert|130|kn|mph km/h|-1}} about {{convert|200|ft|m|-1}} above the ground. Wickson's VID pass was conducted at a speed of about {{convert|450|kn|mph km/h|-1}}, {{convert|500|ft|m|-1}} above and {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2}} to the left of the helicopters. At 10:28 Wickson reported "Tally 2 Hinds" and then passed the two Black Hawks.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, "Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down", Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 6, 60–63, 76, 102 Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 29–30, 53, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Hind" is the [[NATO]] [[NATO reporting name|designation]] for the [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopter, a helicopter that the Iraqi and [[Syria]]n militaries operated and was usually configured with armament on small, side-mounted wings.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 41, Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson responded with "Copy, Hinds" and asked Wang, "Sir, are you listening to this?"  Wang responded, "Affirmative" but offered no further guidance or comments.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 4, Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 6, 76, 102, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 30–31, 53, 211–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

May then conducted his own VID pass about {{convert|1500|ft|m|-2}} above the helicopters and reported, "Tally 2."&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 4, Weiner, "Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down", Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 6, 63, 76, 102, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 30–31, 53, 211–216, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; May later stated to a USAF accident investigation board that his "Tally 2" call meant that he saw two helicopters but did not mean that he was confirming Wickson's identification of them as Hinds.&lt;ref&gt;GAO, "Operation Provide Comfort"&lt;/ref&gt; Neither F-15 pilot had been informed that U.S. Army Black Hawks participating in OPC often carried auxiliary fuel tanks mounted on wings nor had either been instructed in the paint scheme that Iraqi Hind helicopters used, light brown and desert tan, which was different from the dark green color used by the Black Hawks. Wickson later stated that, "I had no doubt when I looked at him that he was a Hind. . . . The Black Hawk did not even cross my mind."&lt;ref&gt;Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 79–80, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following their VID passes, Wickson and May circled back behind the helicopters approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|0}}. Because aircraft from various nations sometimes operated unannounced in the northern Iraq area, the OPC rules of engagement required the F-15 pilots to attempt to verify the nationality of the helicopters. Instead, at 10:28, Wickson notified the AWACS that he and May were "engaged" and instructed May to "arm hot."&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 32, 53, 119, Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 6–7, 63, 102, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; At 10:30, Wickson fired an [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] missile at the trail helicopter from a range of about {{convert|4|nmi|km|-1}}. The missile hit and destroyed the trailing helicopter seven seconds later ({{Coord|36|46|N|44|05|E|type:event|display=inline}}). In response, the lead Black Hawk, piloted by McKenna, immediately turned left and dived for lower altitude in an apparent attempt to evade the unexpected attack. About 20 seconds later, May fired an [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] missile at the lead helicopter from a range of about {{convert|1.5|nmi|km}}, hitting and shooting it down also about {{convert|1.2|mi|km|0}} northeast of the trail helicopter ({{Coord|36|55|N|43|30|E|type:event|display=inline}}). All 26 people on board the two Black Hawks were killed. After flying over the wreckage of the two helicopters lying burning on the ground, May radioed Wickson, "Stick a fork in them, they're done."&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, "Chief of Air Force Grounds 5 Pilots", Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 6–7, 64, Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 4–6. Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 32–34, 53, 124–125, 139, 156, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 111–114, 162. Kurdish farmer Hadi Mohammed and his son Aziz witnessed the incident and reported that the trail helicopter was hit, "in the back and it turned one-quarter turn to the right then it rolled sideways to the left, and then it hit the ground. There was no fire in the inside, just on the outside back, and then it hit the ground and exploded and burned" (Hall, p. 112). Mohammed stated that the second missile "hit the second helicopter, it hit the blades on top, and the helicopter went down behind the hill and exploded and burned" (Hall, p. 114). Hall gives the crash coordinates as {{Coord|36|46|N|44|06|E|type:event|display=inline}} (Hall, p. 158). The USAF initially redacted May's post-shootdown radio call to Wickson from the accident report that was released to the public (Piper).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air Force accident investigation==
By 13:15 local time, Kurdish civilians notified the MCC that they had witnessed the two Black Hawks being shot down {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} north of Arbil and that there were no survivors. The news was quickly picked up by the media and broadcast by [[Cable News Network|CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 48–49, 107, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', p. 160. A Kurdish farmer, Mowfik Tahsin, videotaped the shootdown and some of the wreckage immediately afterwards (Hall, p. 114).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] was briefed on the shootdown and called the heads of government of the United Kingdom and France, [[John Major]] and [[François Mitterrand]], to express regret and sympathy for the deaths of their citizens in the incident. Clinton then appeared a few hours later in a televised news conference in which he stated that he had directed the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) to lead an inquiry into the accident. Clinton further stated, "We will get the facts, and we will make them available to the American people and to the people of Britain, France, and Turkey, our partners in Operation Provide Comfort."&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JamesAndrus.jpg|thumb|upright|right|USAF Major General [[James G. Andrus]]]]

General [[Robert C. Oaks]], USAF, Commander of [[United States Air Forces in Europe]], immediately appointed an Air Force Regulation (AFR) 110-14 accident investigation board composed of a board president, 11 board members from the USAF and U.S. Army, three associate members from France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, four legal advisers, and 13 technical advisers. The board president was Major General James G. Andrus, USAF. An AFR 110-14 investigation's findings are publicly released and the testimony of witnesses in the investigation can be used against them in military disciplinary proceedings. For this reason, after serious mishaps the USAF usually also conducts a separate safety investigation, in which the results are not publicly released and witness testimony is immune from prosecution. In this case, however, for unknown reasons the USAF decided not to conduct a safety investigation.&lt;ref&gt;GAO, "Operation Provide Comfort", Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 8–10, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 67–68, 117, 227, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

After interviewing 137 witnesses and conducting numerous tests, the 27-volume, 3,630-page AFR 110-14 investigation report was publicly released on 13 July 1994, although some report's details had been leaked to the media by unknown defense officials two weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, "Copter Deaths: Pentagon Finds Human Failure", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 123–129, Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 16, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The board made seven general findings about what they believed caused the shootdown to occur:
:1.  Wickson misidentified the Black Hawk helicopters and May failed to notify Wickson that he had been unable to confirm the identity of the helicopters.
:2.  The IFF transponders on the F-15s and/or the Black Hawks did not operate correctly for unknown reasons.
:3.  Misunderstandings existed throughout the OPC forces as to how coalition air operations procedures and responsibilities applied to MCC helicopter operations.
:4.  The AWACS crew commander, Lawrence Tracy, was not currently qualified in accordance with USAF regulations and he and the other AWACS crewmembers committed mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;The USAF AFR 110-14 Accident Investigation Report Summary states that Tracy was not currently qualified because he had not flown the requisite three sorties during the prior three months.  On 22 December 1993 Tracy was placed in "Duty-not-involving-flying" (DNIF) status and did not fly again until 23 February 1994 when he flew one sortie and was waivered to return to mission ready (MR) status.  He did not fly another sortie until the 14 April 1994 mission in which the Black Hawks were shot down.  During that time period, Tracy was incorrectly left in MR status and subsequently incorrectly designated as mission crew commander on 14 April.&lt;/ref&gt;
:5.  OPC personnel in general were not properly trained in the rules of engagement for the northern Iraq no fly zone.
:6.  The Black Hawks were not equipped with more modern radios which would have allowed them to communicate with the F-15s.
:7.  The shootdown "was caused by a chain of events which began with the breakdown of clear guidance from the Provide Comfort Combined Task Force to its component organizations."&lt;ref&gt;GAO, "Operation Provide Comfort", Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 66–67, Piper, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 128, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 281–282.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ProvideComfortAWACScrew.jpg|250px|thumb|[[airborne warning and control system|AWACS]] crew members at their stations aboard their aircraft during an OPC mission]]
The board report stated that, "There is no indication that the AWACS Senior Director (Wang), the Mission Crew Commander (Tracy) and/or the DUKE (Martin) made any radio calls throughout the intercept, or that they issued any guidance to either the AWACS crew or the F-15 pilots."&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, "Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down", Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the OPC ROE did task the AWACS with controlling and monitoring helicopter operations in the TAOR, the board found that the AWACS crew believed that they had no responsibility for controlling U.S. Army Black Hawks or ensuring that other coalition aircraft were aware of Black Hawks operating in the TAOR. When questioned by board investigators as to who was responsible for tracking the helicopters, Tracy said, "I cannot tell you that. I honestly don't know."&lt;ref&gt;Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; When Wang was asked the same question by the investigators, he replied, "No one is responsible."&lt;ref&gt;Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; When the investigators asked Martin what action he took when the F-15s called a visual identification on two Hind helicopters, Martin stated, "I did nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The board found that combined OPC forces, led by Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and other USAF officers, had failed to integrate helicopters into aircraft operations in the TAOR. An Eagle Flight officer later testified that he had been told by the CTF's chief of staff, a USAF officer, that the army Black Hawk unit was not considered to be part of OPC. Thus, the CTF staff, under the direction of Colonel James Rusty O'Brien, USAF, had not tried to coordinate the U.S. Army Black Hawk missions into the daily ATOs. In fact, neither O'Brien nor his predecessors had established any type of procedure for communicating information on Black Hawk missions to the Combined Forces Air Component (CFAC). The MCC commander, Colonel Thompson, had personally called O'Brien on the night of 13 April to tell him about the next day's Black Hawk mission into northern Iraq, a mission that had been specifically and personally approved by Pilkington earlier that day. O'Brien or his staff apparently did not attempt to communicate specific information on this mission to the AWACS or F-15 fighter units at Incirlik, the CFAC, the ground-based mission director, or to the "Duke" on board the AWACS.&lt;ref&gt;Washington, "So, Who's to Blame?", Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 8, 142–161, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 42–43, 210. O'Brien's full title is, "Commander, Operations, Plans, and Policy" for OPC.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ProvideComfortBlackHawkvillage.jpg|thumb|right|A U.S. Army Black Hawk flies over a small village in the Kurdish occupied security zone in Northern Iraq during OPC]]
For reasons that USAF officers were unable to explain, two versions of each day's ATO were published, one for the USAF units at Incirlik, and another for the Eagle Flight unit at Pirinclik. The ATO version sent to Eagle Flight, for unknown reasons, gave a wrong IFF Mode I code for the TAOR. Although army Black Hawks had been operating for almost two years in the TAOR while squawking a wrong code and observed doing so by numerous AWACS crews, no one ever told them that they were using a wrong code. On the day of the shootdown, the F-15s had interrogated the Black Hawks on two different IFF Modes (Mode I and Mode IV). The first responded negatively because the Black Hawks were squawking the wrong code. The second mode responded negatively for technical reasons that the investigation was unable to conclusively determine.&lt;ref&gt;Washington, "So, Who's to Blame?", Schmitt, "Copter Deaths: Pentagon Finds Human Failure", Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 142–161, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 42, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 278–279.  The USAF AFR 110-14 Accident Investigation Report Summary states that the possible reasons that the second mode (Mode IV) responded negatively included:  Wickson and May selected the wrong interrogation crypto code (A or B), both F-15's interrogators malfunctioned, both Black Hawk IFF transponder crypto codes may have been loaded incorrectly, the close proximity of the two Black Hawks to each other may have "garbled" the IFF signals, and the mountainous terrain may have interfered with line-of-sight between the helicopters and the F-15s.&lt;/ref&gt;

The board did not investigate whether any USAF institutional factors, such as a lack of [[crew resource management]] training for the involved aircrews, might have been a factor.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 10–13, 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the board did not attempt to determine if Wickson and May had violated any of the existing OPC rules of engagement as defined by the ATO or other written instructions.&lt;ref&gt;GAO, "Operation Provide Comfort", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Secretary of Defense, [[William Perry]], later summarized the "errors, omissions, and failures" contributing to the accident as, "The F-15 pilots misidentified the Black Hawks, the AWACS crew failed to intervene, Eagle Flight and their operations were not integrated into the Task Force, and the IFF systems failed."&lt;ref&gt;Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; General Shalikashvili, now serving as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], added that, "There were a shocking number of instances where people failed to do their job properly."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, "Court-Martial Begins in 'Friendly Fire' Deaths in Iraq", Verhovek, "Air Force Officer Is Acquitted in Downing of Army Aircraft", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions taken===
On 8 September 1994 the DoD announced the actions it would take in response to the investigation's findings. May was charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide by military legal authorities. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson were charged with dereliction of duty. All of those charged faced an [[Article 32 hearing]] in which it would be decided if they should be tried by court-martial or the matter disposed of otherwise. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson faced a joint Article 32 hearing while May's hearing was separate. Wickson was not charged. Although not explicitly stated by USAF leaders, it appears that Wickson was not charged but May was because Wickson had testified that he was sure of his identification of the two Black Hawks as hostile Hinds, while May had stated that he was not sure of Wickson's identification but had allowed the engagement to proceed anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Washington, "So, Who's to Blame?", Peterson, "Court-Martial Begins in 'Friendly Fire' Deaths in Iraq", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 151–154, 161, Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Santarelli.jpg|thumb|right|upright|USAF Lieutenant General [[Eugene D. Santarelli]]]]
Martin and Halcli waived their rights to the Article 32 hearing, meaning that their cases could move immediately to [[court-martial]] or administrative action. Wickson was given immunity by USAF [[Lieutenant General]] Eugene Santarelli, commander of the [[Seventeenth Air Force|17th Air Force]], to testify at the hearings. The AWACS crew members' hearing, which began on 19 October 1994 at [[Tinker Air Force Base]], [[Oklahoma]] was an open hearing and presided over by Colonel William Colwell, USAF, under the legal jurisdiction of Lieutenant General Stephen Croker, USAF, commander of the [[Eighth Air Force|8th Air Force]]. May's hearing, beginning on 7 November 1994 at [[Sembach Air Base]], Germany was a closed hearing and presided over by Colonel Edward M. Starr, USAF, under the legal jurisdiction of Santarelli. Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and O'Brien declined requests to testify at either hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Wickson did not request immunity. Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 246, Novak, "Past Fiasco dims General's new Third Star", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 161–163, 169–172, 177–183, Associated Press, "No Charges Likely Against F-15 Pilot", Washington, "So, Who's to Blame?".&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 1994 the USAF announced that Colwell had recommended to Croker that Wang face court-martial and that Halcli receive [[nonjudicial punishment|nonjudicial]] administrative action on the dereliction of duty charges. Colwell recommended that the formal dereliction of duty charges be dropped against the other AWACS crew members, but that they could still face nonjudicial action. Croker accepted Colwell's recommendation and ordered Wang to face court-martial and dismissed the criminal charges against the other AWACS crew members except Halcli, who was offered [[nonjudicial punishment|Article 15]] action.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 186–188, 196, Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 246, 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

At his hearing, May changed his testimony from what he gave to the accident investigation board, stating that he ''had'' positively identified the two helicopters as Iraqi Hinds. Brigadier General John R. Dallager, an F-15 pilot and Wickson's and May's wing commander ([[52nd Fighter Wing]]) and regimental court-martial 303 inquiry officer, stated that he found May's errors in the shootdown "reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;Novak, Robert, "Past Fiasco dims General's new Third Star", reported in Soldiers for the Truth, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Starr recommended that the charges against May be dropped, stating that he found May's testimony to be believable.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 December 1994 the USAF announced that Santarelli, an F-15 pilot, had dismissed the charges against May and had decided not to pursue criminal disciplinary actions against any other OPC personnel under his legal jurisdiction, including Wickson, Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and O'Brien. In January 1995 a USAF flying board returned Wickson and May, who had been grounded since the incident, to flying status. Subsequently, Wickson was transferred to [[Randolph Air Force Base]], [[Texas]], to undergo instructor pilot training with a follow-on assignment to [[Columbus Air Force Base]], [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "No Charges Likely Against F-15 Pilot", Peterson, "Court-Martial Begins in 'Friendly Fire' Deaths in Iraq", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 186–188, 196, 201, Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 246, 252, Washington, "So, Who's to Blame?".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emery ch.jpg|thumb|upright|USAF Brigadier General [[Curtis H. Emery]]]]
The USAF later announced the administrative actions taken against the other personnel involved in the shootdown. Pilkington, Emery, and Richardson received letters of admonishment. Martin, May, O'Brien, Tracy, Wickson, and Wilson received [[letter of reprimand|letters of reprimand]]. Halcli accepted an Article 15 action which resulted in his receiving a letter of reprimand. The personnel involved were allowed to petition for the removal of the letters from their records at a future time. The reprimands were placed in "unfavorable information files" for each individual and were normally removed after two years. General [[George Joulwan]], U.S. Army, [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Supreme Allied Commander, Europe]], removed Pilkington as commander of OPC but the USAF retained him as commander of the [[86th Airlift Wing]] at [[Ramstein Air Base]], Germany. O'Brien and Emery were transferred to [[Staff (military)|staff]] positions at the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]. Richardson was transferred to a staff position at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, "DoD Press Briefing", Schmitt, "Chief of Air Force Grounds 5 Pilots", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 132, 222, 240, [[Military Times]], quoted at "Specialist Cornelius A. Bass".&lt;/ref&gt; Emery had been promoted to brigadier general on 15 July 1994 and his promotion was allowed to stand.&lt;ref&gt;Sklute, "DoD NewsBriefing"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wang's court-martial===
Wang's court-martial took place, beginning on 2 June 1995, at Tinker Air Force Base. Wang was tried on three counts of dereliction of duty. Most of the personnel involved in the incident, except May, were called to testify, including the AWACS crew members, Wickson, and Pilkington. Most of the 40 witnesses testified with a grant of immunity.&lt;ref&gt;Arana-Barradas, "Black hawk incident "tragic series of errors", Chu Lin, "Friendly Fire Doesn't Shoot Down Wang", Peterson, "Court-Martial Begins in 'Friendly Fire' Deaths in Iraq", Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 247, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 205–213, Verhovek, "Air Force Officer Is Acquitted in Downing of Army Aircraft".&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, evidence was presented that Wang often had trouble staying awake during AWACS missions. In fact, the problem was considered serious enough that the military had referred Wang to medical authorities to be checked for [[narcolepsy]]. Wang had also previously failed two check rides.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 161, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilkington, an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] pilot, testified that as commander of OPC he had sent numerous aircrew members, the majority of them F-15 pilots, back to their home bases for violating OPC rules or procedures or for displaying a lack of good judgment. In response to questions on the F-15 pilot's actions resulting in the shootdown, Pilkington stated, "I don't understand and I will probably never understand Wickson's mindset."  When asked if Wickson and May violated OPC rules of engagement in the incident, Pilkington responded, "Yes."  AWACS crew members added in their testimonies that once Wickson and May visually identified the helicopters as hostile, all responsibility for the shootdown passed to the F-15 pilots.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, "Court-Martial Begins in 'Friendly Fire' Deaths in Iraq", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Merrill McPeak, official military photo.JPEG|thumb|left|upright|USAF General [[Merrill McPeak]]]]
Frank Spinner, Wang's civilian attorney, argued that [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|USAF Chief of Staff]] General [[Merrill McPeak]], a career fighter pilot, had made clear that he did not want Wickson and May punished for their actions in the shootdown. Cited as evidence for this was a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' report, published also in the European ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' newspaper on 18 June 1994 that stated that McPeak "strongly opposed" court-martial action for Wickson or May. Pilkington stated that he had heard rumors that McPeak had said something to that effect, but could not confirm if they were true or not.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, "Past Fiasco dims General's new Third Star", reported in "Soldiers for Truth" and in Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 252, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 1995 the USAF announced a "nullification" verdict by Wang's 10-member court-martial jury, effectively acquitting Wang of the charges. Nullification is not a finding of innocence, but instead it is a refusal to convict on the stated charges. After the verdict, Wang stated, "I want to say the fight is nowhere near over for me. I want a congressional hearing or investigation into why I was the only person charged."&lt;ref&gt;Verhovek, "Air Force Officer Is Acquitted in Downing of Army Aircraft", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 220–221.&lt;/ref&gt; Major General Nolan Sklute, the USAF's top legal officer, stated, "An incident like this does not necessarily mean that the conduct of all those involved rises to the level of criminal culpability. I'm satisfied with the handling of the case."&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, "DoD Press Briefing", Verhovek, "Air Force Officer Is Acquitted in Downing of Army Aircraft", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Sheila Widnall]] added, "The Black Hawk helicopters were downed as a result of a tragic series of errors and unfortunate events involving numerous people. The mishap was not the result of any one individual's actions; the conduct of numerous officers and the system itself contributed."&lt;ref&gt;Arana-Barradas, "Black hawk incident "tragic series of errors".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Clear}}

==Additional investigations and actions==
On 17 July 1995, [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[William V. Roth, Jr.|William Roth]], chairman of the [[United States Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]], authorized a Senate investigation into the incident, primarily in response to complaints from family members of the shootdown victims that it appeared that the U.S. military was not holding anyone seriously accountable for the shootdown.&lt;ref&gt;Verhovek, "Air Force Officer Is Acquitted in Downing of Army Aircraft", Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 251, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in response to complaints about the DoD's response to the incident, the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives']] [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel|Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel]] scheduled a hearing on the incident for 3 August 1995 to examine the accident investigation and the judicial actions that followed. In addition, on 24 July the DoD ordered the USAF to reexamine the disciplinary and administrative actions for the personnel involved in the shootdown and for the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] to review the corrective actions taken against those involved and determine whether further action was necessary. Widnall requested that the new USAF chief of staff, [[Ronald R. Fogleman]] begin his own review of accountability for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;Washington, "So, Who's to Blame?", Schmitt, "Chief of Air Force Grounds 5 Pilots", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 224, 231–232, Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

The House Committee on National Security hearing on 3 August was presided over by Congressman [[Bob Dornan]] and lasted one day. At the hearing, Pilkington and Andrus explained how the USAF accident investigation was conducted and emphasized that Wickson and May violated the OPC rules of engagement by conducting a VID pass of the Black Hawks that was inadequate to determine the helicopter's national origin. Andrus stated, "Sir, as a pilot, I would have made another pass. You would never fire until you know what you are shooting at."  Retired USAF colonel and pilot Jerry Cox expressed concern to the Committee with the F-15 pilots for not taking responsibility for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 70–71, 233–236, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 205–206. Others testifying at the hearing included Major General Stephan Silvasy, Jr., U.S. Army, for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, USAF Major General Nolan Sklute, USAF Judge Advocate General, US Navy Rear Admiral James Lair, Director of Operations for the US Navy in Europe, US Army Captain Michael Nye, an Eagle Flight pilot, retired USAF colonel Jerry Cox, a former USAF pilot and journalist for the ''[[Military Times]]'', and Frank J. Spinner, Wang's attorney (Hall).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ronald R. Fogleman.jpg|thumb|right|upright|USAF General [[Ronald Fogleman]]]]
On 10 August 1995 Fogleman spoke at a press conference at the Pentagon in which he announced the conclusions reached by his review into the accountability of USAF personnel involved in the shootdown incident. He stated that his investigation found that not all the performance evaluations for the individuals involved in the shootdown reflected the fact that they had received administrative action related to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, "Chief of Air Force Grounds 5 Pilots", GAO, "Operation Provide Comfort"&lt;/ref&gt; Fogleman stated, &lt;blockquote&gt;"The fact that the conduct of some individuals did not give rise to criminal prosecution or conviction should not end the inquiry into the appropriateness of their actions. Air Force standards require that people display the extraordinary discipline, judgment, and training that their duties require and that the American people expect."&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fogleman then announced that he had directed that Wickson, May, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson be disqualified from aviation service duties for at least three years. Also, Fogleman wrote and placed "letters of evaluation" in the permanent personnel files of Wickson, May, Wang, Halcli, Wilson, Pilkington, and Emery that stated that each had failed "to meet Air Force standards in job knowledge, judgment and leadership". In addition, a [[military decoration]] awarded to O'Brien for his service during OPC was rescinded. A videotape in which Fogleman described his actions related to the incident and his views on standards and accountability was distributed throughout the USAF and all USAF officers, senior [[non-commissioned officers]], and [[Senior Executive Service]] civilians were ordered to view it.&lt;ref&gt;Arana-Barradas, "Black hawk incident 'tragic series of errors'", GAO, "Operation Provide Comfort", Schmitt, "Chief of Air Force Grounds 5 Pilots", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 240, Sklute, "DoD NewsBriefing".&lt;/ref&gt; Fogleman further stated that he had found that the military justice system had "worked as it was designed to work".&lt;ref&gt;Sklute, "DoD NewsBriefing".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senate investigation===
Beginning in September 1995 and continuing for more than one year, Roth's Senate inquiry into the shootdown, led by Eric Thorson, investigated the incident. Thorson later stated his belief that the USAF accident investigation report and subsequent proceedings had been manipulated in order to avoid holding Wickson and May accountable for their actions. Thorson also stated that he believed that Starr had submitted an inaccurate and misleading report on May's Article 32 hearing to the USAF commanding officers, including Dallager and Santarelli. With regard to the AWACS personnel, Thorson added that, "We know some of the AWACS crew were incompetent beyond belief, and there is more than adequate evidence to conclude that several crewmembers were grossly negligent."&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 243, 247–250, Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1996, Roth's investigation board asked the DoD to produce the last four witnesses it wished to interview: Santarelli, Starr, Dallager, and Colonel C. G. Mangin. Mangin was Santarelli's legal adviser during the Wickson and May inquiry.  The DoD refused the request to provide access to the four officers.  A short time later, John White, [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense]], wrote a letter to Roth in which he asked that those four officers not be [[Deposition (law)|deposed]].&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 252, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 250–251, Novak, "Past Fiasco dims General's new Third Star"&lt;/ref&gt;

After further refusals from the USAF and DoD to provide the four officers for interview, Roth's committee gave the DoD and USAF until 14:30 on 31 October 1996 to provide the officers. The deadline passed without the officers appearing before the board. The next day the board sent senate [[subpoena]]s directly to the USAF headquarters office at the Pentagon, which refused to accept them. After learning that the senate was now planning to individually serve the four subpoenas directly to the four officers, the associate chief of the Air Force litigation division accepted the subpoenas.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 253–254.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Judith Miller DoD.jpg|thumb|upright|Judith Miller, U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] General Counsel]]
On 13 November 1996 the day the first subpoenaed USAF officer was scheduled to appear, the DoD delivered a letter to Roth, signed by its [[general counsel]], Judith Miller, stating that the DoD believed the subpoenas were invalid because they were issued "after the [[Adjournment sine die|adjournment of ''sine die'']] of the [[104th United States Congress|104th Congress]]" and was therefore not going to honor the subpoenas by providing the four officers for interview. Roth replied to the DoD that only the Senate's legal counsel could determine the validity of congressional subpoenas because of the "[[separation of powers]]" principle in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and thus, the subpoenas were valid. The DoD, on 20 November in another letter signed by Miller again refused to produce the witnesses. Roth, whose committee chairmanship was scheduled to end the next month, was told by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] that the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]], [[Janet Reno]], would not support him if he chose to take the dispute with the DoD to court. Also, many of Roth's senate colleagues, including [[John McCain]], were asking him to "back off". Thus, Roth decided to drop the matter and continue preparing the report without the testimony of Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin. For the first time in U.S. history, the DoD had refused to comply with a U.S. Senate subpoena.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 252, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 254–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1997 U.S. Senator [[Fred Thompson]] became chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and terminated the Black Hawk investigation. The senate investigation report was never publicly released. Asked in 2001 about the DoD's refusal to honor the Senate subpoenas, Thorson responded, "Basically they told the United States Senate to go to hell."&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, "'A Great Deal of Arrogance'", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 262–263, Novak, "Past Fiasco dims General's new Third Star"&lt;/ref&gt;

===GAO investigation===
In September 1995 the House National Security Subcommittee on Military Personnel, chaired by [[Bob Dornan]], requested that the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) conduct its own investigation into the shootdown incident. Specifically, the GAO was asked to determine if the USAF accident investigation board had met its objectives, if the subsequent military justice investigations had followed established guidelines, and if the DoD and/or USAF had improperly or unlawfully influenced these investigations.&lt;ref&gt;GAO report, Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 251, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 241–242, Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAO released its investigation report on 12 November 1997. The investigation determined that the USAF accident investigation was properly convened and met its assigned objectives. The GAO report, however, found that the USAF investigation had failed to note that Wickson and May neglected to report their contact with unidentified aircraft to the Duke (Martin) aboard the AWACS as required by the ROE. Furthermore, the USAF investigation report incorrectly stated that Martin had no authority to terminate the engagement when, in fact, he did. The GAO report added that the failure of Wickson and May to report their contact to Martin was indicative of a well-known, general lack of discipline among F-15 aircrews involved in OPC and this was not discussed in the USAF report.&lt;ref&gt;GAO, "Operation Provide Comfort", Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 252–253, Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 65, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 274–282.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAO investigation also uncovered evidence that a rivalry between F-15 and F-16 pilots may have contributed to Wickson's and May's "urgency to engage hostile aircraft" but was not discussed in the USAF investigation.&lt;ref&gt;GAO, p. 32–33, discussed in Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; During the GAO's investigation, USAF OPC officers confirmed that the rivalry between the F-15 and F-16 communities was particularly pronounced and intense partly due to the fact that F-16 aircraft had scored all the air-to-air combat kills in Iraq and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] since the end of the Gulf War. Pilkington stated to the GAO that, "the shootdown pilots' haste was due in part to the planned entry of two F-16s into the TAOR 10 to 15 minutes after the F-15s and that if the F-15 pilots had involved the chain of command, the pace would have slowed down, ruining the pilots' chances for a shootdown."  The GAO concluded that if the evidence of a lack of mission discipline by Wickson and May had been included in the USAF report, such information "could have been useful in subsequent administrative and disciplinary actions."&lt;ref&gt;GAO, p. 32–33, discussed in Snook, ''Friendly Fire'', p. 96, Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 252–253, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 274–282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect that the GAO investigation revealed was that the training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, "Friendly Fire", p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAO found no evidence of improper or unlawful command influence by USAF leaders on the investigation or subsequent administrative and military justice actions. The GAO noted, however, that it was unable to obtain complete confirmation of this finding because the DoD denied the GAO request to interview key USAF officials including Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 252–253, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 251, 262, GAO, "Operation Provide Comfort", Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 274–282.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation==
On 26 August 1994, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that it would pay US$100,000 (ex gratia) in compensation to the families of each of the non-U.S. personnel killed in the incident. At this time, the U.S. government, citing the [[Feres v. United States|Feres precedent]], did not offer compensation to the families of the U.S. victims. This was the first time that the U.S. had offered compensation to the victims of a friendly fire incident.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 51 &amp; 245, Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 145–150; Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', p. 162. The US Government also paid $100 in compensation to Kurdish farmer Mohammed Amin Khorshid for damage to his onion field caused by the crash of one of the two helicopters (Hall, p. 162).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Congressman [[Lamar S. Smith]], chairman of the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims|Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims]], held hearings on the compensation issue. He questioned the DoD representatives as to why compensation had not also been offered to the U.S. family members. In November 1999 the U.S. Congress passed legislation authorizing payment of compensation to the families of the American Black Hawk victims.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 264 &amp; 269, Diehl, ''Silent Knights'', p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:BlackHawkIncidentCasualtyArrival.jpg|thumb|The remains of the 26 victims of the Black Hawk shootdown arrive at the U.S. Army Mortuary Center, [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt Rhein-Main International Airport, Germany]] on 15 April 1994]]

Five days after the shootdown, USAF OPC officials began including Black Hawk flight times in the daily ATO and included the correct IFF code in the ATO provided to Eagle Flight.&lt;ref&gt;Washington, "So, Who's to Blame?", GAO, "Operation Provide Comfort"&lt;/ref&gt; OPC officially ended on 31 December 1996. Over the six years of the operation, coalition participants flew a total of 62,000 fixed-wing and rotary-wing sorties. The Black Hawk shootdown was the only serious accident to occur during the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wickson resigned and May retired from the USAF soon after Fogleman's investigation was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Chu Lin, "Friendly Fire Doesn't Shoot Down Wang", Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 196, Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', p. 276. Hall states that May retired at the lower rank of major. Hall says that he asked repeatedly for Wickson to contact him to discuss the shootdown but that Wickson never responded (Hall, p. 304).&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence Tracy retired immediately after Wang's court-martial on an early (15-year) retirement option.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, ''Chain of Events'', p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2005|May}} Jim Wang was still serving in the USAF, but he remained at the rank of captain, having been denied promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Chu Lin, ''Friendly Fire Doesn't Shoot Down Wang''. Hall states that after his court martial, Wang called the victims' family members and apologized.&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed in 2005 about the shootdown, Tracy stated, "Jim (Wang) and all of us at first were held up as scapegoats. I think that was to cover up for the pilots. They had their fangs out. They wanted to kill something because it had been ages since an F-15 had shot anything down. We were held accountable for their actions."&lt;ref&gt;Chu Lin, "Friendly Fire Doesn't Shoot Down Wang".&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrus retired from the USAF in 1995, Pilkington in 1996, Emery in 1997, and Santarelli in 1998, all at the same rank they held at the time of the shootdown, except Emery, who retired as a brigadier general. Richardson was promoted to brigadier general on 1 July 1999 and retired on 1 September 2001. Dallager was appointed as superintendent of the [[United States Air Force Academy|USAF Academy]] in June 2000 and was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 August of the same year. Dallager's appointment and promotion were criticized by observers because of his involvement in the controversial shootdown after-actions and refusal to testify for the senate investigation. Dallager retired on 1 September 2003, but at the rank of major general.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, "Past Fiasco dims General's new Third Star", USAF, Official biographies of Andrus, Croker, Dallager, Emery, Pilkington, Richardson, and Santarelli.&lt;/ref&gt;

A monument to the 26 victims of the shootdown was constructed at Giebelstadt Army Airfield, Germany and dedicated on 14 April 1996. After U.S. military presence ceased at Giebelstadt, due to base closures, the monument was moved to [[Fort Rucker]], [[Alabama]] on 10 March 2006, and rededicated on 14 April 2007.&lt;ref name="Eagle_friends"&gt;[http://www.efdmmf.org/index.html Eagle Flight Detachment Memorial Monument Friends] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414221859/http://www.efdmmf.org/index.html |date=14 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall, ''Michael, My Son'', pp. 212, 226. Four hundred people attended that dedication ceremony at Giebelstadt. A videoteleconference room at the [[Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency]] at [[Kelly Field Annex]] was named in honor of Cornelius Bass on 26 March 1998 (Hall, p. 293).&lt;/ref&gt;

"The 53rd FS 'Tigers' never fully recovered from the dark blemish on their otherwise exemplary record. The only way the USAF could make the issue and the pain go away was by closing the unit. This was done on March 10, 1999, leaving [[USAFE]] with only one Eagle squadron for the next war in its theater."&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Steve, and Dildy, Doug, ''F-15 Eagle Engaged—The World's Most Successful Jet Fighter'', Osprey Publishing, Botley, Oxford, UK, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-84603-169-4}}, page 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthropogenic hazards''' are [[hazard]]s [[human impact on the environment|caused by human]] action or inaction. They are contrasted with [[natural hazard]]s. [[Human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] hazards may adversely affect humans, other organisms, [[biome]]s and [[ecosystem]]s. The frequency and severity of hazards are key elements in some [[risk analysis]] methodologies.
Hazards may also be described in relation to the impact that they have. A hazard only exists if there is a pathway to exposure. As an example, the center of the earth consists of molten material at very high temperatures which would be a severe hazard if contact was made with the core. However, there is no feasible way of making contact with the core, therefore the center of the earth currently poses no hazard.

==Societal hazards==
There are certain societal hazards that can occur by inadvertently overlooking a hazard, a failure to notice or by purposeful intent by human inaction or neglect, consequences as a result of little or no preemptive actions to prevent a hazard from occurring. Although not everything is within the scope of human control, there is [[anti-social behaviour]] and [[Crime|crimes]] committed by individuals or groups that can be prevented by reasonable apprehension of injury or death. People commonly report dangerous circumstances, suspicious behaviour or criminal intentions to the [[police]] and for the authorities to investigate or intervene.

===Criminality===
{{Main|Crime}}
Behavior which puts others at risk of injury or death is universally regarded as criminal and is a breach of the [[law]] for which the appropriate legal authority may impose some form of penalty, such as imprisonment, a fine, or even [[capital punishment|execution]]. Understanding what makes individuals act in a way that puts others at risk has been the subject of much research in many developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/2013-mjr-risk-fctrs-ntscl/index-eng.aspx |title=Major Risk Factors for Antisocial and Delinquent Behaviour among Children and Youth|publisher=Public Safety Canada|access-date=18 October 2015|date= 4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitigating the hazard of criminality is very dependent on time and place with some areas and times of day posing a greater risk than others.

===Civil disorder===
{{Main|Civil disorder|Riot}}
Civil disorder is a broad term that is typically used by law enforcement to describe forms of disturbance when many people are involved and are set upon a common aim. Civil disorder has many causes, including large-scale criminal conspiracy, socio-economic factors (unemployment, poverty), hostility between racial and ethnic groups and outrage over perceived moral and legal transgressions. Examples of well-known civil disorders and riots are the [[Poll Tax Riots]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1990; the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] in which 53 people died; the [[2008 Greek riots]] after a 15-year-old boy was fatally shot by police; and the [[2010 Thai political protests]] in [[Bangkok]] during which 91 people died. Such behavior is only hazardous for those directly involved as participants or those controlling the disturbance or those indirectly involved as passers-by or shopkeepers for example. For the great majority, staying out of the way of the disturbance eliminates the hazard.

===Terrorism===
{{Main|Terrorism|Asymmetric warfare}}

The common definition of terrorism is the use or threatened use of violence for the purpose of creating fear in order to achieve a political, religious, or ideological goal. Targets of terrorist acts can be anyone, including private citizens, government officials, military personnel, law enforcement officers, firefighters, or people serving in the interests of governments.

Definitions of terrorism may also vary geographically. In [[Australia]], the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, defines terrorism as "an action to advance a political, religious or ideological cause and with the intention of coercing the government or intimidating the public", while the [[United States Department of State]] operationally describes it as "premeditated, {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated violence perpetrated against [[non-combatant]] targets by sub national groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7052/7052.pdf |title=The Definition of Terrorism CM 7052 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War===
{{Main|War}}
War is a conflict between relatively large groups of people, which involves physical force inflicted by the use of weapons. Warfare has destroyed entire cultures, countries, economies and inflicted great suffering on humanity. Other terms for war can include armed conflict, hostilities, and police action. Acts of war are normally excluded from insurance contracts and sometimes from disaster planning.

===Industrial hazards===
[[Work accident|Industrial accidents]] resulting in releases of hazardous materials usually occur in a commercial context, such as [[mining accident]]s. They often have an [[Environmental disaster|environmental impact]] but also can be hazardous for people living in proximity. The [[Bhopal disaster]] saw the release of [[methyl isocyanate]] into the neighbouring environment seriously affecting large numbers of people. It is probably the world's worst industrial accident to date.

=== Engineering hazards ===
[[Engineering]] hazards occur when structures used by people fail or the materials used in their construction prove to be hazardous. This history of construction has many examples of hazards associated with structures including bridge failures such as the [[Tay Bridge disaster]] caused by under-design, the [[Silver Bridge]] collapse caused by corrosion attack or the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|original Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] caused by aerodynamic flutter of the deck. Failure of dams was not infrequent during the [[Victorian era]], such as the [[Dale Dike Reservoir|Dale Dyke dam]] failure in [[Sheffield]], [[England]] in 1864, causing the [[Great Sheffield Flood]], which killed at least 240 people. In 1889, the failure of the [[South Fork Dam]] on the [[Little Conemaugh River]] near [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], produced the [[Johnstown Flood]], which killed over 2,200. Other failures include [[balcony collapse]]s, aerial walkway collapses such as the [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse]] in [[Kansas City]] in 1981, and building collapses such as that of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]] in 2001 during the [[September 11 attacks]].

===Waste disposal===
{{main|Waste disposal|Pollution}}
In managing waste many hazardous materials are put in the domestic and commercial [[List of waste types|waste stream]]. In part this is because modern technological living uses certain toxic or poisonous materials in the electronics and chemical industries. Which, when they are in use or transported, are usually safely contained or encapsulated and packaged to avoid any exposure. In the waste stream, the waste products exterior or encapsulation breaks or degrades and there is a release and exposure to hazardous materials into the environment, for people working in the waste disposal industry, those living around sites used for waste disposal or [[landfill]] and the general environment surrounding such sites.

===Power outage===
{{Main|Power outage}}
A power outage is an interruption of normal sources of electrical power. Short-term power outages (up to a few hours) are common and have minor adverse effect, since most businesses and health facilities are prepared to deal with them. Extended power outages, however, can disrupt personal and business activities as well as medical and rescue services, leading to business losses and medical emergencies. Extended loss of power can lead to civil disorder, as in the [[New York City blackout of 1977]]. Only very rarely do power outages escalate to disaster proportions, however, they often accompany other types of disasters, such as [[hurricane]]s and [[flood]]s, which hampers relief efforts.

[[Electromagnetic pulse]]s and [[voltage spike]]s from whatever cause can also damage electricity infrastructure and electrical devices.

Recent notable power outages include the [[2005 Java–Bali Blackout]] which affected 100 million people, [[2012 India blackouts]] which affected 600 million and the [[2009 Brazil and Paraguay blackout]] which affected 60 million people.

===Fire===
[[File:Zaca3.jpg|thumb|An active flame front of the [[Zaca Fire]]]]
{{Main|Bush fire|Fire|Mine fire|Wildfire|Firestorm}}
{{category see also|Fire disasters involving barricaded escape routes}}

Bush fires, forest fires, and mine fires are generally started by [[lightning]], but also by human negligence or [[arson]]. They can burn thousands of square kilometers. If a fire intensifies enough to produce its own winds and "weather", it will form into a [[firestorm]]. A good example of a mine fire is the one near [[Centralia, Pennsylvania|Centralia]], Pennsylvania. Started in 1962, it ruined the town and continues to burn today. Some of the biggest city-related fires are The [[Great Chicago Fire]], The [[Peshtigo Fire]] (both of 1871) and the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666.

Casualties resulting from fires, regardless of their source or initial cause, can be aggravated by inadequate emergency preparedness. Such hazards as a lack of accessible [[emergency exit]]s, poorly marked escape routes, or improperly maintained [[fire extinguisher]]s or [[fire sprinkler system|sprinkler systems]] may result in many more deaths and injuries than might occur with such protections.

[[File:Skyline Parkway Motel Burned.jpg|thumb|A building damaged by [[arson]]]]
{{Main|Arson}}

Arson is the setting a [[fire]] with intent to cause damage. The definition of arson was originally limited to setting fire to [[building]]s, but was later expanded to include other objects, such as [[bridge]]s, [[vehicle]]s, and [[private property]]. Some human-induced fires are accidental: failing machinery such as a kitchen stove is a major cause of accidental fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byorg/georgia/disast.html |title=Disaster Preparedness Planning |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=cool.conservation-us.org |publisher=[[American Institute for Conservation]] |access-date=2012-01-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hazardous materials==
{{Main|Dangerous goods}}

===Organohalogens===
[[Organohalogens]] are a family of synthetic organic molecules which all contain atoms of one of the [[halogen]]s. Such materials include [[Polychlorinated biphenyls|PCBs]], [[Dioxin]]s, [[DDT]], [[Freon]] and many others. Although considered harmless when first produced, many of these compounds are now known to have profound physiological effects on many organisms including man. Many are also fat soluble and become concentrated through the food chain.

===Toxic metals===
Many metals and their salts can exhibit [[toxicity]] to humans and many other organisms. Such metals include, [[Lead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Cullen |first1= Jay T.|last2=McAlister|first2=Jason|chapter= Chapter 2. Biogeochemistry of Lead.Its Release to the Environment and Chemical Speciation|publisher= de Gruyter|publication-date= 2017|series= Metal Ions in Life Sciences|volume=17|title=Lead: Its Effects on Environment and Health|editor1-last=Astrid|editor1-first= S.|editor2-last=Helmut|editor2-first=S.|editor3-last=Sigel |editor3-first= R. K. O.|doi=10.1515/9783110434330-002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cadmium]], [[Copper]], [[Silver]], [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] and many of the [[transuranic]] metals.

===Radioactive materials===
{{main|Radioactive decay}}
[[Image:Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.jpg|thumb|[[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear power plant]]]]

Radioactive materials produce ionizing radiation which may be very harmful to living organisms. Damage from even a short exposure to radioactivity may have long term adverse health consequences.

Exposure may occur from [[nuclear fallout]] when nuclear weapons are detonated or nuclear containment systems are compromised. During [[World War II]], the [[United States Army Air Forces]] dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], leading to extensive contamination of food, land, and water. In the Soviet Union, the [[Mayak]] industrial complex (otherwise known as Chelyabinsk-40 or Chelyabinsk-65) exploded in 1957. The [[Kyshtym disaster]] was kept secret for several decades. It is the third most serious nuclear accident ever recorded. At least 22 villages were exposed to radiation and resulted in at least 10,000 [[displaced person]]s. In 1992, the [[Soviet Union collapse|former Soviet Union]] officially acknowledged the accident. Other [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] republics of [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] suffered also when a reactor at the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear power plant]] had a [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] in 1986. To this day, several small towns and the city of Chernobyl remain abandoned and uninhabitable due to fallout.

The [[Hanford Site]] is a decommissioned nuclear production complex that produced plutonium for most of the 60,000 weapons in the U.S. nuclear arsenal. There are [[Hanford Site#Environmental concerns|environmental concerns about radioactivity released from Hanford.]]

A number of military accidents involving nuclear weapons have also resulted in [[radioactive contamination]], for example the [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash]] and the [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash]].

[[File:5243639897 0d84ebc96f bYperite.jpg|thumb|left|upright|100px|Dermatitis (burn) of chin from vapors of [[mustard gas]]]]

===CBRNs===
{{Main|CBRN}}
''CBRN'' is a catch-all acronym for [[chemical]], [[biological warfare|biological]], [[radiological]], and [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]]. The term is used to describe a non-conventional terror threat that, if used by a nation, would be considered use of a weapon of mass destruction. This term is used primarily in the United Kingdom. Planning for the possibility of a CBRN event may be appropriate for certain high-risk or high-value facilities and governments. Examples include [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Halabja poison gas attack]], the [[Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway]] and the preceding test runs in Matsumoto, Japan 100 kilometers outside of Tokyo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1995_rpt/aum/part05.htm |title=V. Crimes of the Cult - A Case Study on the Aum Shinrikyo |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Lord Amherst]] giving [[smallpox]] laden blankets to Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/amherst/lord_jeff.html |title=Amherst and Smallpox |publisher=Nativeweb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
===Aviation===
[[Image:Plane crash into Hudson River muchcropped.jpg|thumb|The ditching of [[US Airways Flight 1549]] was a well-publicised incident in which all on board survived]]
{{Main|Air disasters}}
An aviation incident is an occurrence other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft, which affects or could affect the safety of operations, passengers, or pilots. The category of the vehicle can range from a [[helicopter]], an [[airliner]], or a [[space shuttle]].

===Rail===
[[Image:Train wreck at Montparnasse 1895.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Granville-Paris Express [[Montparnasse derailment|wreck]] at [[Gare Montparnasse]] on 22 October 1895]]
{{Main|Rail disasters}}
The special hazards of traveling by rail include the possibility of a train crash which can result in substantial loss of life. Incidents involving freight traffic generally pose a greater hazardous risk to the environment. Less common hazards include geophysical hazards such as [[tsunami]] such as that which struck in 2004 in [[Sri Lanka]] when 1,700 people died in the [[2004 Sri Lanka tsunami-rail disaster|Sri Lanka tsunami-rail disaster]].

See also [[List of accidents and disasters by death toll#Train accidents|the list of train accidents by death toll.]]

===Road===
[[Traffic collision]]s are the leading cause of death, and road-based pollution creates a substantial health hazard, especially in major conurbations.

Space travel presents significant hazards, mostly to the direct participants ([[astronauts]] or [[cosmonauts]] and ground support personnel), but also carry the potential of disaster to the public at large. Accidents related to space travel have killed 22 astronauts and cosmonauts, and a larger number of people on the ground.

Accidents can occur on the ground during launch, preparation, or in flight, due to equipment malfunction or the naturally hostile environment of space itself. An additional risk is posed by (unmanned) [[low Earth orbit|low-orbiting]] [[satellite]]s whose orbits eventually decay due to friction with the extremely thin atmosphere. If they are large enough, massive pieces traveling at great speed can fall to the Earth before burning up, with the potential to do damage.

One of the worst human-piloted space accidents involved the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] which disintegrated in 1986, claiming all seven lives on board. The shuttle disintegrated 73 seconds after taking off from the launch pad in [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]].

Another example is the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']], which disintegrated during a landing attempt over [[Texas]] in 2003, with a loss of all seven astronauts on board. The debris field extended from [[New Mexico]] to [[Mississippi]].

Ships can sink, capsize or crash in disasters. Perhaps the most infamous sinking was that of the [[The Titanic#Sinking|Titanic]] which hit an iceberg and sank, resulting in one of the worst [[List of accidents and disasters by death toll|maritime disasters]] in history. Other notable incidents include the [[Costa Concordia disaster|capsizing of the Costa Concordia]], which killed at least 32 people; and is the largest passenger ship to sink, and the [[MV Doña Paz|sinking of the MV Doña Paz]], which claimed the lives of up to 4,375 people in the worst peacetime maritime disaster in history.

==Environmental hazards==

Environmental hazards are those hazards where the effects are seen in [[biome]]s or [[ecosystem]]s rather than directly on living organisms. Well known examples include [[oil spill]]s, [[water pollution]], slash and burn de-forestation, air pollution,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5758">The '''Berne incident''' consisted in the brief seizure of the [[Romania]]n embassy in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]], by a group of Romanian [[émigré]]s who opposed the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. It occurred between February 14 and February 16, 1955.

==Events==

The attack was planned and led by Oliviu Beldeanu, a sculptor born in 1924 in [[Dej]]. At the age of 15 he became a member of ''Frunză Verde'' ("Green Leaf"),&lt;ref&gt;Troncotă, p.438&lt;/ref&gt; a youth organisation associated with the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], and after the end of [[World War II]] he joined the [[Romanian anti-communist resistance movement|anti-communist resistance movement]]. In 1949, he fled to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], only to return a few months later, allegedly as an agent of the [[UDBA]].&lt;ref&gt;Troncotă, p.439&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, Beldeanu arrived in [[Italy]]; he later settled in [[Konstanz]], [[West Germany]].

In 1954, Beldeanu began preparing the assault on the Romanian embassy: he travelled several times to Switzerland, acquired the needed weapons and tools, and held training sessions with the other members of the group (Ion Chirilă, Stan Codrescu, Dumitru Ochiu and Tudor Ciochină).

On the evening of February 14, 1955, the group drove from Konstanz to Berne, broke into the embassy around midnight and entered the embassy's driver's residence. The members of the group then proceeded to discreetly search for secret documents.&lt;ref&gt;Olaru, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; 

Around 2:00 AM, Aurel Şeţu, the embassy's driver (and possibly a [[Securitate]] agent) returned and entered into an altercation with Codrescu and Ochiu, following which Şeţu was shot. Though hurt, the driver managed to leave the annex building, and was later discovered heavily bleeding under a tree. He was then transported to the hospital where he died. After the shooting most of the embassy's staff had fled.

The [[Federal Department of Justice and Police|Swiss police]] was notified by the ambassador and surrounded the building, but without intervening, since the ambassador did not allow them to enter the property at first. The group demanded the release from Romanian prisons of several important personalities, such as [[Dinu Brătianu]]. On the night of February 15/16, Dumitru Ochiu exited the embassy, carrying with him a number of documents; he was immediately arrested by the Swiss police.&lt;ref&gt;Olaru, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the group surrendered the next day.

The police returned the stolen documents immediately to the Romanian legation, thereby arising a lot of speculations about their content. The news agency "Globe Press" pretended that Aurel Şeţu was the actual head of the Romanian legation and a senior Securitate officer and that the stolen documents were ciphered messages for Moscow. As the police of Bern later found out, this information had in fact been invented by a Czechoslovakian refugee.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal de Genève'', 16 février 1955 ss.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==

According to its organizers, the attack's purpose was to attract international attention to the abuses, injustices and human rights violations perpetrated by the [[Communist Romania|communist Romanian government]], as well as exposing the [[espionage]] activities of the Romanian embassy in Switzerland.

However, the Romanian government of the time accused the Iron Guard structure in exile (under the leadership of [[Horia Sima]]) and [[Western world|Western]] intelligence agencies of masterminding a fascist anti-Romanian plot with the complicity of the Swiss authorities.

Some commentators have suggested that the group was indeed acting on behalf of a foreign intelligence service, looking for documents related specifically to covert Romanian agents in the Western program of parachuting agents into areas of the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;Troncotă, p.440&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The members of the group were tried in Berne. Oliviu Beldeanu was sentenced to four years in prison, Stan Codrescu (who had shot Aurel Şeţu) to three and a half years, Ion Chirilă to three and a half years and Dumitru Ochiu to a year and four months.

In Romania, protest gatherings were staged in several towns and a large commemorative meeting held in Bucharest on the occasion of Aurel Şeţu's burial.

Oliviu Beldeanu was released from prison in 1957, but the communist regime did not intend to leave his action go unpunished. He was lured to [[West Berlin]] and abducted by [[Stasi]] and Securitate agents,&lt;ref&gt;Troncotă, p.461&lt;/ref&gt; then taken to [[Bucharest]], subjected to a [[kangaroo trial]], and executed on February 18, 1960.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17054">The '''British Hill Climb Championship''' (BHCC) is the most prestigious Hillclimbing championship in Great Britain.  [[Hillclimbing in the British Isles]] has a rich history and this event has been held every year since 1947.

All British Champions have been [[British people|British]]. As of the end of the 2016 season, the most successful driver in terms of individual victories is Scott Moran, with 152. Moran and [[Tony Marsh (racing driver)|Tony Marsh]] jointly hold the record for the most championships, with six. [[Ken Wharton]] is the only driver to win four consecutive titles.

==Format==

A major hillclimb may have an entry of more than 150 drivers, but the event is usually a qualifying round of more than one competition, and some drivers (especially drivers of less powerful cars) will not be entered for the British Championship itself. Those who are, and who record a time in the top twelve of all those eligible, compete in a "run-off" at the end of each set of class run (there are two such sets of class runs at each event). In a run-off, drivers tackle the hill in reverse order of their qualifying times, although where two drivers share a car, the slower qualifier competes at the start of the run-off session. The person who sets the fastest time receives 10 British Championship points, the second-fastest driver nine, and so on down to the tenth-placed driver, who gets one. The 11th and 12th-placed drivers, and any who fail to complete the course, receive no points.

An extra point is given to any driver in the run-off who breaks the outright hill record ''as it stood at the beginning of the day''. There are usually 34 such run-offs (i.e. 17 hillclimbs with two run-offs at each), but drivers can only count their 28 best results towards their final points total. In 2004, [[Adam Fleetwood]] achieved the unprecedented feat of winning 28 rounds, and so had to drop all his non-win points. Even so, he won the championship by a huge margin - before taking account of his dropped scores, he had racked up 318 points, with the runner-up, 1997 champion [[Roger Moran]], a massive distance behind on 176 points.

==History==
===The early days===
The first climb of the inaugural series was staged at [[Bo'ness Hill Climb|Bo'ness]], near [[Linlithgow]], [[Scotland]] on 17 May 1947. It was one of five events in that year's championship, the other climbs being held at Bouley Bay, Craigantlet, Prescott and Shelsley Walsh. All but Bo'ness still host rounds of the BHCC. The inaugural championship, as well as the 1948 title, went to [[Raymond Mays]], who proved he was still the force to be reckoned with that he had been before [[World War II]]. [[Sydney Allard]] won the title in 1949 in the self-built Steyr-Allard.

===The 1950s===
Although the 1950 championship went to [[Alfa Romeo]] driver [[Dennis Poore]], from then on every title of the decade was to be won by a driver who had spent most or all of the year behind the wheel of a [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] with a [[JA Prestwich Industries|JAP]] engine. [[Ken Wharton]] started the trend, and became the only man to win four successive BHCC titles. In the mid-Fifties there were three successive titles for the near-legendary Tony Marsh, a man who would still be competing at the highest level of hillclimbing as the 20th century closed. And finally, another [[hat-trick]] of championships went to [[David Boshier-Jones]].

Sadly the decade was also touched by tragedy, when Bill Sleeman was killed at [[Bouley Bay Hill Climb|Bouley Bay]], [[Jersey]] in 1955.

The final round of the decade was held at [[Stapleford Aerodrome]] on 11 October 1959, an event won by [[David Good]] in a Cooper-J.A.P. 1,100 c.c.&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Sport'', November 1959, Pages 839, 844.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1960s===
Although the 1960s opened as the Fifties had ended, with Boshier-Jones taking the honours in his Cooper-JAP, the decade was to see a marked change in hillclimbing. One notable feature of 1960s climbing was the appearance of [[four-wheel drive]], with several of the decade's championships being won by drivers in such cars, including two for [[Peter Westbury]].

Mike Gray became the second driver to be killed at a BHCC round when he lost his life at Barbon in 1964.

===The 1970s===
The Seventies saw two notable firsts: [[Roy Lane]]'s maiden championship in 1975, and the first of 18 titles in the space of 22 years for [[Pilbeam Racing Designs|Pilbeam]] drivers when Alister Douglas-Osborn took the honours in 1977.

===The 1980s===
This decade also saw the first championship to be won by a [[Gould Racing|Gould]] driver, when Chris Cramer took the title in 1985. However, it was to be the late 1990s before the Pilbeam near-stranglehold on the BHCC would be broken for any length of time.

===The 1990s===
The 1990s continued and even intensified [[Pilbeam Racing Designs|Pilbeam]]'s dominance of the sport, with the first eight championships of the decade being won by a driver in one of the marque's cars. By the time [[Roger Moran]] clinched the title in 1997, Pilbeam drivers had won 18 of the 22 championships since 1977, a dominance rivalled only by the [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] years of the 1950s and early 1960s.

However, change was afoot, and the 1998 championship went to a Gould driver, [[David Grace]]. The future [[CEO]] of [[Rockingham Motor Speedway]] stamped his authority on the championship with a hat-trick of titles as the 20th century closed. As of 2004, every champion since had been behind the wheel of a Gould.

The hillclimb world was shocked in 1995 by the death of one of its leading lights, when [[Mark Colton]] was killed in practice at Craigantlet. He thus became only the third driver to lose his life in the history of the BHCC.

===Recent times===

The start of the 21st century saw a "changing of the guard" in the BHCC, as young drivers in lightweight cars made their presence felt at the highest level. [[Graeme Wight Jr]] dominated in 2001, and in June he broke the outright record at [[Shelsley Walsh]] that had stood for nine years. Almost a year later he became the first driver to break the 25-second barrier at the track, winning a prize of £1,000.

The 2001 season was severely disrupted by the [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|foot and mouth crisis]] that year, which caused the postponement of some rounds of the series, though only one climb - at Barbon - was actually cancelled entirely, and co-operation between event organisers and local landowners meant that spectators continued to be admitted to the meetings, albeit with precautions such as the disinfecting of cars entering the car parks.

A little later in the decade, once [[Adam Fleetwood]] had proved that he could translate his exploits in smaller cars to the top class, Wight Jr began to come under intense pressure, and by 2004 Fleetwood usually had the better of their battles. Sadly that season's championship was robbed of a classic battle for the title when Wight Jr pulled out in June to wait for the arrival of a new car - this had still not been driven in anger by the end of the year. However, crowds around the country could console themselves by watching a true master of the hills at work. Fleetwood won all but six of the year's 34 BHCC rounds, breaking hill records for fun - and in turn became the first person to climb Shelsley in under ''24'' seconds.

Fleetwood's announcement in April 2005 that other commitments would prevent his defending his title meant once again that the two most successful drivers of the 2000s would not go head-to-head, and the stage seemed set for Wight Jr to regain his crown, although his new V10 Predator proved unreliable, allowing the impressive [[Martin Groves]] to open up a lead at the top of the points table; Groves had the championship wrapped up by early August. With Wight Jr still nowhere to be seen, Groves retained the title in 2006, although he had to wait a month longer than in the previous year thanks to a spirited challenge from [[Scott Moran]]. Groves again held off Moran's charge in 2007 to complete a hat-trick of titles, but in 2008 Moran took his first championship win, retaining his title in 2009.

Moran has since won a further five titles, and his Gould GR61X (by far the most successful car in the history of the championship, with 157 run-off wins) has won seven at the end of 2016 season; after several seasons in a supercharged [[Suzuki Hayabusa]]-engined DJ Firehawk, Alex Summers co-drove the GR61X with Moran and became champion in it at his first attempt.

Between 1998 and 2016, the only non-Gould driver to win the championship has been Trevor Willis, who did so in 2012 with his OMS 25, a less powerful but lighter car with a V8 engine derived from two Hayabusa units.

The government of China is engaged in [[espionage]] overseas, thought to be directed primarily through the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] (MSS). It is suspected of employing a variety of tactics including [[cyber spying]] to gain access to sensitive information remotely and physical agents ([[HUMINT]]). China is believed to be engaged in [[industrial espionage]] aimed at gathering information to bolster its economy, as well as monitoring dissidents abroad such as supporters of the [[Tibetan independence movement]] and [[Falun Gong]].&lt;ref name="aw1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianwarrior.com/2016/09/decoding-mss-ministry-of-state-security-china.html|title=Decoding MSS: Ministry of State Security – China|publisher=Asian Warrior|date=5 September 2016|accessdate=2 April 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913035411/http://www.asianwarrior.com/2016/09/decoding-mss-ministry-of-state-security-china.html|archivedate=13 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States believes the Chinese military has been developing network technology in recent years in order to perform espionage on other nations. Several cases of computer intrusions suspected of Chinese involvement have been found in various countries including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, India and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Macartney, Jane|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3000697.ece |title=China hits back at 'slanderous and prejudiced' alert over cyber spies|work=[[The Times]]|date=5 December 2007|accessdate=2008-04-07 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Barnes, Julian E.|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-uschina4mar04,1,3559963.story|title=China's computer hacking worries Pentagon|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=4 March 2008|accessdate=2008-03-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310042216/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-uschina4mar04%2C1%2C3559963.story|archivedate=10 March 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brookes, Peter|url=http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/homeland.php?id=1386912|title=Flashpoint: The Cyber Challenge: Cyber attacks are growing in number and sophistication|work=Family Security Matters|date=13 March 2008|accessdate=2008-04-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329074454/http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/homeland.php?id=1386912|archivedate=29 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Canadian researchers say they have found evidence that Chinese hackers had gained access to computers possessed by government and private organizations in 103 countries, although researchers say there is no conclusive evidence China's government was behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7970471.stm|title=Major cyber spy network uncovered|publisher=BBC News|date=29 March 2009|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beijing also denied involvement.

==Intelligence activity worldwide==

===Africa===

====Ethiopia====
In January 2018, ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported that the headquarters of the [[African Union]], which had been constructed by the [[China State Construction Engineering Corporation]], had had its computer systems compromised between 2012 and 2017, with data from AU servers being forwarded to [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name="LeMonde"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2018/01/26/a-addis-abeba-le-siege-de-l-union-africaine-espionne-par-les-chinois_5247521_3212.html |title=A Addis-Abeba, le siège de l’Union africaine espionné par Pékin |publisher=''[[Le Monde]]'' |language=French |date=January 26, 2018 |first= oan |last=Tilouine |first2=Ghalia |last2=Kadiri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/the-african-union-headquarters-hack-and-australias-5g-network/ |publisher=[[Australian Strategic Policy Institute]] |title=The African Union headquarters hack and Australia’s 5G network |date=July 13, 2018 |first=Danielle |last=Cave}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news|title=African Union accuses China of hacking headquarters|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c26a9214-04f2-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5|date=29 January 2018|accessdate=31 January 2018|first1=John|last1=Aglionby|first2=Emily|last2=Feng|first3=Yuan|last3=Yang|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building's computer system was subsequently removed and the AU refused a Chinese offer to configure the replacement system. ''Le Monde'' alleged that the AU had then covered up the hack to protect Chinese interests in the continent.&lt;ref name="LeMonde"/&gt;

China and the [[African Union]] have rejected the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/30/china-african-union-headquarters-bugging-spying |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |title=China rejects claim it bugged headquarters it built for African Union |date=January 30, 2018 |author=[[Reuters]] |quote=China and the African Union dismissed on Monday a report that Beijing had bugged the regional bloc’s headquarters, which it built and paid for in the Ethiopian capital.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopian Prime Minister [[Hailemariam Desalegn]] rejected the French media report, saying that he doesn't believe it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enca.com/africa/au-spying-report-absurd-china|title=AU spying report absurd: China|website=enca.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moussa Faki|Moussa Faki Mahamat]], head of the African Union Commission, said the allegations in the Le Monde's report were false.

Since at least April 2017, TEMP.Periscope, an [[advanced persistent threat]] based in China, has been hacking Cambodian organizations related to the [[Cambodian general election, 2018|2018 general election]].&lt;ref name="camfire"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html |publisher=[[FireEye]] |title=Chinese Espionage Group TEMP.Periscope Targets Cambodia Ahead of July 2018 Elections and Reveals Broad Operations Globally |date=July 10, 2018 |first=Scott |last=Henderson |first2=Steve |last2=Miller |first3=Dan |last3=Perez |first4=Marcin |last4=Siedlarz |first5=Ben |last5=Wilson |first6=Ben |last6=Read}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targets included the National Election Commission, the [[Ministry of Interior (Cambodia)|Ministry of Interior]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Cambodia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation]], the [[Senate of Cambodia]], and the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Cambodia)|Ministry of Economy and Finance]].&lt;ref name="camfire"/&gt; The APT engaged in [[Phishing#Spear_phishing|spear phishing]] against [[Monovithya Kem]] of the [[Cambodia National Rescue Party]], sending messages which impersonated the [[Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="camfire"/&gt;

====India====

Several U.S. citizens have been convicted for spying for China. Naturalized citizen Dongfan Chung, an engineer working with [[Boeing]], was the first person convicted under the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]].

'''Comprehensive emergency management,''' as defined in various laws throughout the United States, is the preparation for and the carrying out of all emergency functions, other than functions for which the military forces are primarily responsible, to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies and disasters, and to aid victims suffering from injury or damage, resulting from disasters caused by all hazards, whether natural, technological, or human caused, and to provide support for search and rescue operations for persons and property in distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=38.52.010 |title=RCW 38.52.010: Definitions |publisher=Apps.leg.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive emergency management is the philosophy that gave birth to the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] and the eventual decline of the term [[civil defense]] in the United States.  Under Comprehensive Emergency Management, attention is given to the full range of emergencies from small weather incidents to the "ultimate emergency" of war.  Its "all-hazards" philosophy stands in contrast to previous state and federal emergency management that focused solely on a massive [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/about/history.shtm |title=About the Agency |publisher=FEMA.gov |date=2013-07-22 |accessdate=2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For any local or state jurisdiction, Comprehensive Emergency Management involves the creation of an emergency management plan, typically an ''Emergency Operations Plan'' that provides for the activation of an [[Incident Command System]] as a flexible central command structure for in-coming and committed resources that required to deal with all aspects of the incident as an emergency situation. Other command-level constructs include multiagency coordination and public information systems; overall, the federal command construct for Comprehensive Emergency Management is the [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/is700.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227071919/http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/is700.asp |date=December 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] officer and [[prisoner of war]] during the [[Vietnam War]].

==Biography==
Martin was assigned to Detachment 1 [[38th Rescue Squadron|38th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]] (38th ARRS), based at [[Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base]], Thailand. On September 20, 1965, Captain Thomas J. Curtis, Martin, Sergeant William A. Robinson crew chief, and Pararescue Specialist (PJ) Arthur Black took off in their [[Kaman Aircraft|Kaman]] [[HH-43 Huskie]] BuNo 62-4510, callsign ''Dutchy 41'' on a [[combat search and rescue]] (CSAR) mission for ''Essex 04'', an [[F-105]]D piloted by Capt Willis E. Forby, over [[North Vietnam]]. The HH-43 was hit by ground fire and crashed in the jungle.

Curtis, Robinson, and Black were all captured by the [[North Vietnam|North Vietnamese Army]] and taken to a [[POW camp]] in North Vietnam. They were later released during [[Operation Homecoming]]. Martin, on the other hand was captured by the [[Pathet Lao]] and taken to a POW camp in [[Laos]]. There, he joined fellow prisoners [[Eugene DeBruin]] (American), [[Phisit Intharathat]], Prasit Promsuwan, Prasit Dhanee (all [[Thai people|Thai]]), and Y.C. To (Chinese). They were joined in February 1966 by [[Dieter Dengler]].

On June 29, 1966, while the guards were eating, the group slipped out of their hand and foot restraints and grabbed the guard's unattended weapons. The Pathet Lao guards spotted some of the other prisoners trying to escape. Dieter fired at a machete wielding guard and [[Phisit Intharathat]] killed the other guards. Phisit, in his own account, says he killed one guard as he reached for his rifle and says three in total were killed and the rest ran away. The seven prisoners split into three groups: Phisit, and the other Thai prisoners; DeBruin stayed with To, who had been too ill to continue with the escape; Dengler and Martin headed for the [[Mekong River]] to escape to Thailand.

Several days after the escape, Martin and Dengler were hiding out near an [[Akha people|Akha]] village. Martin had a bout with malaria and was severely weakened. He was further demoralized when an attempt to signal a [[C-130 Hercules|C-130]] flareship that came over them produced no results. He told Dengler that he was going to die. Later that day he told Dengler that he was going to try to steal some food from the village. Dengler told him it would be suicide but accompanied him on the venture. As they neared the village, they encountered a boy playing with a dog. The boy alerted the village of their presence and a villager came running toward them with a [[machete]]. Martin knelt down on the trail with his hands clasped before him in supplication, but the man swung at Martin, first hitting him in the leg. His second swing struck Martin in the back of the neck, killing him. Dengler managed to escape back into the jungle and was rescued several weeks later. Other than Dengler, [[Phisit Intharathat]] was the only known survivor. The rest of the prisoners are still unaccounted for.

In the 2007 film ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'', which told the story from Dengler's point of view, Martin was portrayed by actor [[Steve Zahn]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20975">The '''FIA–FOTA dispute''' was a series of ongoing political clashes between the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) and [[Formula One Teams Association]] (FOTA) over proposed changes to the rules and regulations for the [[2010 Formula One season]]. The debate began over the introduction of a budget cap and culminated on the eve of the [[2009 British Grand Prix]] with the FOTA teams announcing their intention to form their own [[Grand Prix World Championship|rival breakaway series]]. From that point onwards, the dispute was eased to the point at which a new [[Concorde Agreement]] was signed in August 2009.

==Introduction and pre-history==
The origins of the dispute may be traced as far back as the middle of 2008 when regulations that would see the single biggest overhaul in the sport's sixty-year history were approved for the 2009 season. Early in 2009, FIA President [[Max Mosley]] put forth a proposal for 2010 intended to secure the sport's future in the face of the [[Financial Crisis of 2007-2009|ongoing economic situation]]. The proposal included an optional budget cap of €30 million, with greater technical and design freedoms allowed to teams who nominated to use it. This was a point of contention among the teams, who objected to what was essentially two different sets of rules within the championship.

In response to this, [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] filed an injunction with a French court in Paris in an attempt to stop the proposed regulations from being implemented. The courts ruled that Ferrari's objections were baseless; given its history and close association with the sport, the team had been awarded a technical veto a decade beforehand that would have allowed them to prevent any regulation changes they disagreed with, but the court ruled that as Ferrari had not used the veto at the previous meeting of the [[FIA World Motor Sport Council]], they did not have grounds for a legal challenge.

==FOTA's objections and withdrawal==
Seven of the FOTA teams – [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[BMW Sauber]], [[Toyota Racing|Toyota]], [[Renault F1|Renault]], [[Brawn GP]], [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] and [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] announced their intentions to withdraw from the 2010 championship by virtue of not submitting entries. At the time, [[Bernie Ecclestone]] believed a compromise with the teams may be possible, but on May 15, the FIA failed to reach a settlement with the teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8049816.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Motorsport &amp;#124; Formula 1 &amp;#124; F1 chiefs stay firm on budget cap |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten FOTA teams met on the weekend of the [[2009 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], where they unanimously decided to withdraw by the end of the 2009 season unless the budget cap rules were changed, citing their opposition to the "two-tier" system and the need for continuity within the rules from one season to the next as their reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/75610 | title = Teams demand FIA ditch 2010 rules | first = Jonathan | last = Noble | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]] | date= 2009-05-24| accessdate = 2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Williams F1|Williams]] submitted an unconditional entry to the FIA less than three days later, claiming that they existed solely for the purposes of racing and that withdrawing was against their purpose as a racing team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/75626 | title = Williams submits F1 entry for 2010 | first = Jonathan | last = Noble | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]] | accessdate = 2009-05-25 |date= 2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were subsequently suspended from FOTA while negotiations continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/75646 | title = Williams team suspended by FOTA  | first = Jonathan | last = Noble | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]| date= 2009-05-27| accessdate = 2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Force India]] submitted an unconditional entry of its own on June 5. They, too, were suspended from FOTA for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/75843 | title = FIA Force India lodges unconditional entry | first = Jonathan | last = Noble | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]| date= 2009-06-05| accessdate = 2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the remaining FOTA teams eventually submitted conditional entries for the 2010 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8075887.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Motorsport &amp;#124; Formula 1 &amp;#124; Ferrari stay firm over budget cap |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-05-31 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New teams for 2010==
Concurrently to this, the FIA intended to open the 2010 grid up to three new teams, and received entries from fifteen interested parties, including [[Prodrive F1|Prodrive]], [[Lola Cars|Lola]], [[Team US F1|USF1]] and [[Brabham]]. The 2010 entry list was published on June 12, and included new teams [[Campos Grand Prix]], [[Manor Grand Prix]] and [[Team US F1|USF1]]. The FIA also claimed that [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] and [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] were contractually bound to compete until 2012 and so included them on the entry list, and gave remaining teams [[Brawn GP|Brawn]], [[McLaren]]-[[Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines|Mercedes]], [[Renault F1|Renault]] and [[Toyota Racing|Toyota]] one week to remove the conditions attached to their entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76045 | title = FIA announces 2010 F1 entry list | first = Jonathan | last = Noble | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]| date= 2009-06-12| accessdate = 2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as four provisional teams were said to be in negotiations with the FIA in the event of one or more FOTA teams withdrawing for 2010; whether over the budget cap, a downturn in their road car division or other extenuating circumstances, Renault were reported to have informed suppliers of a potential withdrawal at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/214008/renault-warns-suppliers-of-f1-exit/ | title=Renault warns suppliers of F1 exit | publisher = GP Update | date = 2009-06-10 | accessdate = 2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, the FIA announced its intentions to continue ahead with the budget cap, now raised to €45 million after talks with FOTA once again failed to find a resolution. Claiming that a solution had been put forth a week previously, the FIA accused factions within FOTA of sabotaging the negotiations, and further claimed that the organisation was attempting to gain control over the governance and commercial rights to the sport, a practice it declared unacceptable.

==Threat of breakaway series==
In the week preceding the [[2009 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], the eight remaining FOTA teams wrote to the FIA, calling for an urgent compromise to the situation and requesting an extension to the deadline in order to negotiate a new [[Concorde Agreement]]. The letter made it clear that the FOTA teams were willing to commit until 2012 and supply new teams with technical knowledge and advice. The FIA replied within two hours, indicating that it was willing to deal with FOTA, but stated that the June 19 deadline would stand owing to obligations to the potential new teams and the inability to agree on a new Concorde Agreement in such a short period of time. Mosley's proposal would see the introduction of a budget cap, engine and gearbox rules remaining fixed and the allowance of tyre warmers which were previously expected to be banned for 2010. In addition, Mosley stated a willingness to review the FIA's International Court of Appeal and abandon a controversial appendix to the 2010 rules that would give the FIA the unconditional authority to set rules.

However, after a meeting at Renault's base of operations in [[Enstone]], the eight FOTA teams announced their intentions to press ahead with a breakaway series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76292 | title = FOTA teams to launch breakaway series | first = Jonathan | last = Noble | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]| date= 2009-06-18| accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the divisions in American open-wheel racing leagues between [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] and [[Champ Car|CART]] in [[1979 IndyCar season|1979]] (similar in that most "name" teams and drivers left for the new championship), or CART and the [[Indy Racing League|IRL]] in [[1996 IndyCar season|1996]]. After threatening legal action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76316 | title = FIA to launch legal action against FOTA | first = Pablo | last = Elizade | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]| date= 2009-06-19| accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the FIA renounced its position, offering to talk with the teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76425 | title = Mosley open to talks with FIA | first = Matt | last = Beer | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]| date= 2009-06-21| accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; FOTA, however, disagreed, claiming that the decision had already been made and that they would not be changing their minds, though Red Bull's [[Christian Horner]] stated that he felt it was foolish to commit to everything too soon. Commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone later vowed to ensure the future of the sport, claiming that the ongoing issues between the FIA and FOTA amounted to "basically, nothing".

The conflict came to an apparent head on June 24 at the meeting of the [[World Motorsport Council]] in Paris, with FOTA agreeing to remain within the championship and FIA President Max Mosley agreeing not to stand for re-election in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76495 | title = Mosley: Peace agreed in Formula 1 
| first = Steven | last = English | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]| date= 2009-06-24| accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the resolution was thrown into potential jeopardy just twenty-four hours later, with Mosley demanding FOTA in general and [[Luca di Montezemolo]] in particular apologise for misleading the media, suggesting Mosley to be a 'dictator' and that he would have no involvement in Formula One until he stepped down as President, no involvement in the FIA afterwards and that he was forced out of office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76529 | title = Mosley rethinks future after FOTA claims

==Further complications==
On 8 July, the FOTA group of teams walked out of a meeting with the FIA about future rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76777 | title = FOTA teams walk out of FIA meeting

FOTA were informed that they were not entered for the 2010 season and could therefore have no input on regulatory discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76778| title = FOTA says FIA putting F1 in jeopardy | first = Jonathan | last = Noble | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]| date= 2009-07-08| accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later announced that plans for a breakaway series were still being pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76802| title = FOTA pushing ahead with breakaway  | first = Jonathan | last = Noble | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]| date= 2009-07-09| accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the weekend of the German Grand Prix, FOTA teams expressed confidence in ending the ongoing debate, stating their intentions to negotiate the terms of a new Concorde Agreement directly with CVC, the company that controls the commercial rights to the sport, with a resolution possibly being found in time for the Hungarian Grand Prix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76905| title = Formula 1 row nearing end  | first = Jonathan | last = Noble | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]| date= 2009-07-12| accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that same day, Bernie Ecclestone announced that he would be involved in the process and vowed to have the sport's future secured with a new Concorde Agreement signed within forty-eight hours, ending the breakaway threat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76942| title = Ecclestone vows to sort F1 in 48 hours | first = Jonathan | last = Noble | work = autosport.com | publisher = [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]| date= 2009-07-13| accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on July 15, it was confirmed that Max Mosley would step down from the FIA Presidency.

On July 6, an unnamed team made accusations against the FIA that new teams had been selected on the basis that they had no association with the current manufacturers. On July 12, unsuccessful applicants [[N.Technology]] filed a legal challenge against the FIA in Paris, claiming they had been informed that the only way to receive an entry for 2010 was to nominate the use of a [[Cosworth]] spec-engine when the team felt it stood a "real chance" of securing a deal with a current engine supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76907| title =

==2009 Concorde Agreement and BMW's withdrawal==
On the weekend of the [[2009 Hungarian Grand Prix]], the thirteen teams met with commercial rights holder [[CVC Capital Partners|CVC]] to discuss a new [[Concorde Agreement]] which would guarantee the sport's future until 2012. The FIA announced that it was willing to sign the agreement provided that all thirteen teams could agree to cost-cutting measures, but two teams – [[Williams F1|Williams]] and [[Manor Grand Prix|Manor]] – had raised late objections to the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Concorde dependent upon cost-cutting deal|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/77208|author=Jonathan Noble, Autosport.com|date=2009-07-24|accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed cost-cutting regulations include [[homologation]] of front and rear wings, a limit on the number of upgrades a team can introduce over the course of a season, a continuation of the in-season testing ban introduced in 2009, restrictions on the number of personnel able to attend a race, and the teams agreeing to completely close down their factories during the summer break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teams give details of 'cost regulation document'|url=http://www.motorsport.com/#/all/article/?id=337962|work=Motorsport.com|publisher=GMM|date=24 July 2009|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 2009 [[BMW Sauber]] announced they were withdrawing from Formula One at the end of the 2009 season. They cited "current developments in motor sport" as the reason for their decision
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BMW to quit F1 at end of season |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8173865.stm
|publisher=BBC | date=2009-07-29 | accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later on August 1, it was announced that the FIA had signed the Concorde Agreement, thus bringing an end to the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Concorde Agreement finally signed|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/77481|author1=Beer, Matt |author2=Autosport.com |date=2009-08-01|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Concorde Agreement is said to return to the system used in 1998, restoring voting rights to the teams and the establishment of working groups and commissions to make decisions. Included in the document is a clause allowing BMW Sauber an additional week to sign up in the event that they accept a rescue package to keep them in the sport.

==Zoran Stefanovic and the European Commission==
Following N.Technology's lawsuit against the FIA, a complaint was made to the [[European Commission]] by Zoran Stefanovic, an aspiring team principal supporting N.Technology's claims that the FIA had required new teams to nominate a Cosworth engine if they wanted to join the 2010 grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=European Commission receives F1 complaint|url=http://www.pitpass.com/fes_php/pitpass_news_item.php?fes_art_id=38607|publisher=Pitpass|date=2009-08-01|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stefanovic had intended to field a team to be known as Stefan Grand Prix and that he had explored the possibility of acquiring engines from a current manufacturer. His complaint to the European Commission claimed that the FIA demonstrated bias in the selection process and was in violation of anti-competition laws, and he requested that the selection process be carried out again.

Stefanovic had attempted to enter Formula One on two previous occasions,&lt;ref name="Collantine, Keith; F1 Fanatic"&gt;{{cite news|title=Zoran Stefanovic explains his complaint to the EU about the FIA|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2009/08/02/exclusive-zoran-stefanovic-explains-his-complaint-to-the-eu-about-the-fia/#comment-275135|author=Collantine, Keith; F1 Fanatic|date=2009-08-02|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; including an attempt to purchase the remains of [[Lola T97/30|Lola's disastrous 1997 attempt]]. He claimed that the FIA had not simply shown bias against non-Cosworth teams, but also against teams that would be classified as manufacturers, citing that new teams [[Manor Grand Prix|Manor]], [[Campos Grand Prix|Campos]] and [[Team USF1|USF1]] were forced to outsource the design of their chassis to other firms and design studios whereas Stefan Grand Prix had the support of Serbian aircraft manufacturer AMCO, and thus could build their own cars independently. This bias, he claimed, was supported by [[Prodrive F1|Prodrive's]] failure to make the grid; like Stefan, Prodrive would have the facilities to build their own chassis.&lt;ref name="Collantine, Keith; F1 Fanatic"/&gt; Stefanovic, however, had the support of [[Mike Coughlan]], the [[2007 Formula One espionage controversy|disgraced]] [[McLaren]] engineer.

Despite Stefanovic's planned action against, he announced his intentions to field a team in time for the season-opening race in [[Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]] and compete despite not having a grid position&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stefan Grand Prix want 2010 slot|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2009/09/29/stefan-grand-prix-still-wants-2010-slot/|first = Keith|last = Collantine|date=2009-09-21|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a move similar to the stillborn [[Phoenix Finance]] team and their failed attempt to purchase a grid position in [[2002 Formula One season|2002]]. Stefanovic cited the FIA granting a precedented fourteenth grid position to Peter Sauber's [[Qadbak Investments]] team as his inspiration, claiming that in the event that any one of the 2010 teams withdrew, the FIA may grant another special entry to Stefan Grand Prix. This was at odds with the FIA's assertion that in the event that a team were to withdraw, special provisions would not be issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/219661/fia-calls-for-14-teams-in-2010/|title=FIA calls for 14 teams in 2010|publisher=GP Update|date=2009-09-15|accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Festival of Pacific Arts''', '''Pacific Arts Festival''', or '''FESTPAC''' is a traveling festival hosted every four years by a different country in [[Oceania]] ([[:Image:Oceania.jpg|map]]). It was conceived by the [[Pacific Community]] (former "''Secretariat of the Pacific Community''")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/corp/|title=Secretariat of the Pacific Community|last=Unattributed|date=8 August 2008|work=Pacific Community Website|language=en, fr|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a means to stem erosion of traditional cultural practices by sharing and exchanging culture at each festival.  The major theme of the festival is traditional song and dance.  The 2008 Festival of Pacific Arts was hosted by [[American Samoa]] from 20 July to 2 August 2008; it was the 10th Festival of Pacific Arts.&lt;ref name="DOIrelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/oia/press/2007/04302007.html|title=2008 Festival of the Pacific Arts|last=Unattributed|date=1 May 2007|publisher=Office of Insular Affairs, United States Department of the Interior|language=|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AMSAMfestival"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacartsas.com/|title=10th Festival of Pacific Arts -- American Samoa -- July 20 - August 2, 2008|last=Unattributed|work=10th Festival of Pacific Arts|publisher=American Samoa Office for the 10th Festival of Pacific Arts|language=|accessdate=2008-08-09}} The official web site of the 10th Festival of Pacific Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pdnfpaclosing"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guampdn.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080802/NEWS01/808020320|title=Festival of Pacific Arts holds closing ceremonies|last=Unattributed|date=2 August 2008|work=Guampdn.com|publisher=Pacific Daily News|language=|accessdate=2008-08-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pacific Cultural Council (former "''Pacific Arts Council''" or "''Council of Pacific Arts''," originally "''South Pacific Arts Festival Council''")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=130/focusContentID=12874/tableName=mediaRelease/overideSkinName=newsArticle-full.tpl|title=Festival of Pacific Arts changes name|last=Unattributed|date=26 July 2008|work=Islands Business|publisher=Islands Business International|language=|accessdate=2008-08-10}} This mis-titled article describes adoption of name change, not by the Festival of Pacific Arts, but by its overseeing body, from "Council of Pacific Arts" to "Pacific Cultural Council."&lt;/ref&gt; selects the host country and recognizes that each participating country desires the opportunity to showcase its unique indigenous culture by hosting the festival.  Host selection is based on principles of equity and preference is given to countries which have not yet hosted.  The festival host country pays participants' costs of local travel, accommodation, meals, and other forms of hospitality. Entry to all artistic events is free to the public thereby maximizing cultural outreach and inclusion.

By its vastness, the [[Pacific Ocean]] inhibits social and cultural interchange between the inhabitants of its mostly [[Island country|island countries]].  The festival, not a competition but a cultural exchange, reunites people and reinforces regional identity and mutual appreciation of Pacific-wide culture.  Participating countries select artist-delegates to represent the nation at this crossroads of cultures, considered a great honour.

About 2,000 artists attended&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/07/21/pacific-arts-festival-hours-away-from-opening|title=Pacific Arts Festival Hours Away From Opening|last=Secretariat of the Pacific Community|date=21 July 2008|work=Pacific Magazine|publisher=Trans-Oceanic Media|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2008 Festival of Pacific Arts from these participating countries:&lt;ref name="AMSAMfestival" /&gt; American Samoa, [[Australia]], [[Cook Islands]], [[Easter Island]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Fiji]], [[French Polynesia]], [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], [[Kiribati]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Nauru]], [[New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Niue]], [[Norfolk Island]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Palau]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Pitcairn Islands]], [[Samoa]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tokelau]], [[Tonga]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Wallis and Futuna]].&lt;ref name="DOIrelease" /&gt; [[Taiwan]] was allowed to send a delegation of 80 performers and artists, most of whom were [[Taiwanese aborigines]], to the Festival of Pacific Arts for the first time in 2008.&lt;ref name=rnzi&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Taiwan gets go ahead to attend Pacific Arts Festival in American Samoa |url= http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=40355 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |publisher= |date=2008-06-15 |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Standard Theatre''', now known as the '''Folly Theater''' and also known as the '''Century Theater''' and '''Shubert's Missouri''', is a former [[vaudeville]] hall in downtown [[Kansas City, Missouri]].  Built in 1900, it was designed by Kansas City architect [[Louis Curtiss|Louis S. Curtiss]]. The theater was associated with the adjoining Edward Hotel (known later as the Hotel Missouri), which was also designed by Curtiss; the hotel was demolished in 1965.

==History==
The Standard Theatre opened with 2,400 seats on September 23, 1900, featuring [[burlesque]] and vaudeville.&lt;ref name="follystan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.follytheater.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t4.asp?docid=578&amp;DocName=Standard%20Theatre|title=Standard Theatre (September 1900-August 1901)|year=2004|work=Folly Theater History|publisher=Folly Theater|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built by Colonel Edward Butler of [[St. Louis, Missouri]], at a cost of $250,000, for his son to present shows on the Empire vaudeville circuit.&lt;ref name="folly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.follytheater.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t4.asp?docid=516&amp;DocName=Folly%20History.|title=Folly Theater History|year=2004|publisher=Folly Theater|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, a fire at the nearby Coates Opera House caused opera and comic opera performances to be moved to the Standard, featuring such performers as [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Richard Mansfield]], and [[Maude Adams]]. The theater's name changed to the "Century" in 1902. The Century featured acts from the Empire burlesque circuit, including  [[Al Jolson]], [[Fannie Brice]], and [[Eddie Foy, Sr.|Eddie Foy]]. In addition to theater acts, the Century featured prizefighting and wrestling, with appearances by [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] and [[Jack Dempsey]].

The [[Shubert brothers]] bought the Century in 1923 and renamed it "Shubert's Missouri" after extensive renovations by Shubert architect [[Herbert J. Krapp]].&lt;ref name="follyshub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.follytheater.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t4.asp?docid=561&amp;DocName=Shubert's%20Missouri%20Theatre|title=Shubert's Missouri Theater (September 1923-September 1932)|year=2004|work=Folly Theater History|publisher=Folly Theater|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shuberts booked dramatic productions including [[Shakespeare]] and [[Eugene O'Neill|O'Neill]] plays. The [[Marx Brothers]] performed ''I'll Say She Is'' for three weeks in 1923-24, the long run convincing the Shuberts to continue operating the theater.&lt;ref name="follyshub"/&gt; After 1928, business began falling off and the theater was used for touring shows on an intermittent basis until it closed in 1932. After a tax sale it eventually reopened in 1941 as "The Folly", featuring [[striptease]]. Performers included [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] and [[Tempest Storm]], and before the Folly closed in January 1974, [[Chesty Morgan|Chesty Gabor]]. The theater began showing "adult" movies in 1969, apparently prompting an unknown person to plant a dynamite stick in a drainpipe on December 29, 1969.&lt;ref name="follyburl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.follytheater.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t4.asp?docid=563&amp;DocName=Folly%20Burlesque|title=Folly Burlesque (1941-1974)|year=2004|work=Folly Theater History|publisher=Folly Theater|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 the theater's then owners, Annbar Associates and Elk Realty of New York announced that if a new buyer could not be identified by the end of the year, the theater would be demolished to make way for a parking lot.&lt;ref name="APReprieve"&gt;{{cite news |last=Associated |first=Press |date=February 15, 1975 |title=Historic Showhouse Gets Reprieve |newspaper=The Evening Standard |location=Uniontown, Penn. |publisher=Uniontown Newspapers, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of local historic preservation activists, including [[Joan Dillon (historic preservation activist)|Joan Dillon]] and [[William N. Deramus III]], formed a nonprofit, the Performing Arts Foundation, to raise the money to purchase and restore the theater. The theater was offered for sale for $950,000. Performing Arts Foundation raised $350,000 in contributions and through negotiation convinced Annbar Associates to offer the remaining $600,000 of the purchase price as a donation.&lt;ref name="APReprieve" /&gt; Following the Folly's listing on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974,&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; a "Strip the Folly" fundraiser was held featuring [[Sally Rand]], who had performed at the Folly. After seven years a full renovation was completed in 1981, including the construction of an annex on the site of the former Edward Hotel.&lt;ref name="follyreno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.follytheater.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t4.asp?docid=564&amp;DocName=Restoration%20&amp;%20Renovation|title=Restoration/Renovation (1974-November 1981)|year=2004|work=Folly Theater History|publisher=Folly Theater|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Folly's centennial year of 2000, a new lobby, restrooms, and second-floor Shareholders' Room were added.  In 2005, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Folly's reopening, the auditorium's original color scheme was restored.  Plans are now under way, and approval has been granted by the Kansas City Landmarks Commission, to install a marquee sign that closely mimics the original Folly signage.

The Performing Arts Foundation of Kansas City, d.b.a. The Folly Theater, is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit corporation whose mission is "to preserve Kansas City's oldest historic theater as a premier performance venue by presenting, producing, and hosting a wide range of quality events for the community".  The Folly produces a Jazz Series, a Kids Series, and "Cyprus Avenue Live!" performances by artists ranging from blues to rock and country.  It hosts the Harriman-Jewell Series of classical performers, the Friends of Chamber Music series, and the [[Heartland Men's Chorus]].

==Description==
The Neo-Palladian facade uses Carthage [[limestone]] and red pressed brick, with an adapted  [[Palladian window]] centered in the facade. Rather than a fully glazed infill within the limestone Palladian framework, the lower portion of the unit uses three arched windows with an entablature over the center window dividing it from the lunette under the principal arch. The street level is heavily rusticated limestone with three arched entrances and wrapping a short way around the right (east) side to form an additional arch. The east wall contains small limestone-framed ventilation openings near the top, as well as emergency exits and a {{convert|19|ft|m|adj=on}} high opening for stage scenery. The building is {{convert|125|ft|m}} deep, {{convert|70|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|65|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt;

The interior structure mixes steel and wood construction. There is a basement under the stage, housing mechanical systems and backstage service spaces. The main floor is entered through a lobby and a box office area. The house contains three sections of seats facing a highly decorated proscenium arch. The house is flanked by balcony-level boxes, with the main balcony to the rear. The stage is provided with a [[fly loft]], fly balconies, a scenery workshop, and ten dressing rooms. Interior decoration is predominantly red and gold.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt;

The exterior is largely unaltered, but the interior has been substantially renovated. In 1923, the lobby was reduced in size, moving the box office and eliminating a secondary box office for the balcony, while the balcony itself and a gallery level were replaced by a single larger balcony, reducing [[seating capacity]].  Plasterwork in the upper levels was replaced at this time, and a manager's apartment was removed.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt;

Current [[seating capacity]] is 1,078 seats.&lt;ref name="follyrent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.follytheater.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t4.asp?docid=518&amp;DocName=Facility%20Rental.|title=Folly Theater Rental|year=2012|publisher=Folly Theater|accessdate=2009-05-04}} {{Live link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]] suffered badly during the period of the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. The Depression began  with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and rapidly spread worldwide. As in other nations, Australia suffered years of high unemployment, poverty, low profits, [[deflation]], plunging incomes, and lost opportunities for economic growth and personal advancement.

The Australian economy and foreign policy largely rested upon its place as a primary producer within the [[British Empire]], and Australia's important [[export]] industries, particularly primary products such as [[wool]] and [[wheat]], suffered significantly from the collapse in international demand. [[Unemployment]] reached a record high of around 30% in 1932,&lt;ref name="australia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/great-depression |title=The Great Depression |publisher=australia.gov.au |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABS1933&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1301.01933?OpenDocument |title=Year Book Australia 1933 - Chapter 24: Labour, Wages &amp; Prices |author=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |year=1933 |accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/greatdepression/ |title=The Great Depression - australia.gov.au |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gross domestic product]] declined by 10% between 1929 and 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Siriwardana |first=Mahinda |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=June 1998 |title=Can Policy-Makers Learn from History?

There were also incidents of [[civil unrest]], particularly in Australia's largest city, [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Leviathan: The unauthorised biography of Sydney |author=[[John Birmingham]] |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-09-184203-1 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Australian Communist and far right movements were active in the Depression, they remained largely on the periphery of Australian politics, failing to achieve the power shifts obtained in Europe, and the democratic political system of the young Australian Federation survived the strain of the period.

The [[James Scullin]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Government had just assumed power with the commencement of the [[Scullin Ministry]] on 22 October following the [[Australian federal election, 1929|1929 federal election]], however just a couple of days later, "Black Thursday" would mark the start of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the subsequent global onset of the Great Depression. From the outset the government was buffeted by the effects of the global economic crisis. With the government unable to implement the [[deflationary]] [[Premiers' Plan]], [[Australian Labor Party split of 1931|Labor had split by 1931]] over how to deal with the crisis, with [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Ted Theodore]] failing to implement his [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] [[inflationary]] plans, and [[Premier of New South Wales|New South Wales Premier]] [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]] losing office over his plans to boost the budget through a temporary cessation of interest repayments on debts to Britain and that interest on all government borrowings be reduced by 3% to free up money for injection into the economy. Labor defector [[Joseph Lyons]] helped to form the [[United Australia Party]] through the ending of the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] and succeeded Scullin as [[Prime Minister of Australia]] from the [[Australian federal election, 1931|1931 federal election]] until his death in 1939.

Thus Australia, unlike the United States, did not embark on a significant [[Keynesian]] program of spending to recover from the Depression. Nevertheless, the Australian recovery began around 1932.  Australians took consolation from sporting achievements through the Depression, with cricketer [[Don Bradman]] and race horse [[Phar Lap]] achieving long-lasting fame.

==1920s: The calm before the storm==
The Great War ([[World War I]]) had depleted Britain's savings and foreign investments, and wartime [[inflation]] had upset the United Kingdom's [[terms of trade]]. A sluggish economy in Britain naturally reduced British demand for imports from Australia throughout the 1920s and this had affected Australia's balance of payments. Throughout the 1920s the Australian unemployment rate floated between 6% and 11%.&lt;ref name=ABS1933/&gt;

The Great War had also caused many necessary [[infrastructure]] projects to be delayed or abandoned, many of which began in the 1920s, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/harbourbridge/ |author=Commonwealth Department of Environment, Heritage and the Arts |title=Sydney's Harbour Bridge - Australia's Culture Portal |date=14 August 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515020410/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/harbourbridge/ |archivedate=15 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sydney's underground railway system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nswrail.net/lines/show.php?name=NSW:city_circle&amp;mode=history |title=City Circle |author=Bozier, Rolfe |accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth government]] beginning to fund major highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auslink.gov.au/publications/reports/history.aspx |author=Commonwealth Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government |title=A History of Australian Road and Rail |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=28 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121202527/http://www.auslink.gov.au/publications/reports/history.aspx |archivedate=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New [[dam]]s and [[grain elevator]]s were built, and the rural railway network was expanded in nearly every state. Large sums of government money were made available to provide returned First World War servicemen with farmland and agricultural equipment under [[Soldier settlement (Australia)|soldier settlement]] schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/featurearticlesbyCatalogue/72BB159FA215052FCA2569DE0020331D?OpenDocument |author=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |title=1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 1925 - Settlement of Returned Soldiers and Sailors 1914-18 |year=1925 |accessdate=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these publicly funded projects were paid for by loans raised by both state and federal governments. Most of these loans were raised on capital markets in the [[City of London]] at an average of £30 million per annum.&lt;ref name=Giblin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/giblin/australi.htm |title=Australia, 1930: An inaugural lecture |author=L.F. Giblin |date=1930-04-28 |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1929: The storm erupts==
In 1910, the federal government introduced a national currency, the [[Australian pound]], which it pegged to the [[pound sterling]]. In effect, Australia was on the [[gold standard]] through the [[United Kingdom|British]] peg. In 1914, Britain removed the pound sterling from the gold standard, creating [[inflation]] pressures. Britain returned the pound sterling to the gold standard in 1925 at pre-1913 parity, effectively [[Revaluation|revaluing]] both currencies significantly and unleashing crushing [[deflation]]ary pressures and falling export demand. This had the immediate effect of making British and Australian exports far less competitive in non-British markets, and affected Australia's terms of trade.

In 1929, as an emergency measure during the Great Depression, Australia left the gold standard, resulting in a devaluation relative to sterling. A variety of pegs to sterling applied until December 1931, when the government set a rate of £1 Australian = 16 shillings sterling. This was intended to ease entry of Australian goods into the British and other linked markets.

Falling export demand and commodity prices placed massive downward pressures on wages, particularly in industries such as [[coal]] mining. Due to falling prices, bosses were unable to pay the wages that workers wanted. The result was a series of crippling strikes in many sectors of the economy in the late 1920s. Coal miners' strikes in the winter of 1929 brought much of the economy to its knees. A riot at a [[picketing (protest)|picket line]] in the [[Hunter Region]] mining town of [[Rothbury, New South Wales|Rothbury]] saw police shoot one teenage coal miner dead.

The conservative [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Stanley Bruce]], wished to dismantle the [[Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904|conciliation and arbitration system]] of judicially supervised [[collective bargaining]] which had been the cornerstone of Australia's [[industrial relations]] system since the 1900s, which would allow employers alone to increase or decrease employee wages in response to economic and market conditions.

The opposition [[Australian Labor Party]], led by [[James Scullin]], successfully depicted Stanley Bruce as wanting to destroy Australia's high wages and working conditions in the [[Australian federal election, 1929|1929 federal election]]. Scullin was elected Prime Minister in a landslide which saw Stanley Bruce voted out as the Member for [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]], the only time until the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] that a sitting Prime Minister lost his seat.

The [[James Scullin]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Government had just assumed power with the commencement of the [[Scullin Ministry]] on 22 October following the [[Australian federal election, 1929|1929 federal election]], however just a couple of days later, [[Black Thursday]] would mark the start of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the subsequent global onset of the Great Depression. From the outset the Scullin administration was buffeted by the effects of the global economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/scullin/ |title=James Scullin - Australia's PMs - Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date=1929-10-21 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Scullin's term, commodity prices continued to fall, unemployment rose, and Australia's big cities were depopulated as thousands of unemployed men took to the countryside in search of menial agricultural work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The stagnant economy had reduced economic activity and therefore tax revenues. However, the debt commitments of both state and federal governments remained the same. Australia became severely at risk of defaulting on its foreign debt which had been accumulated during the relative prosperity and infrastructure-building frenzy of the 1920s.

The Great Depression in Australia saw huge levels of unemployment and economic suffering amid plummeting export income.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/scullin/in-office.aspx#section2 |title=In office - James Scullin - Australia's PMs - Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the economic downturn was a product of international events, Australian governments grappled with how to respond. Conventional economists said governments should pursue deflationary policies. Radicals proposed inflationary responses and increased government spending. Division emerged within the Labor Party over how to respond.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1992"&gt;K J Mason; ''Experience of Natiohood''; 3rd Edition; McGraw Hill; 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1930, Scullin invited Sir [[Otto Niemeyer]] of the Bank of England to come to Australia to advise on economic policy. Niemeyer met with Federal and State leaders at a conference in Melbourne where he recommended a traditional deflationary response of balanced budgets to combat Australia's high levels of debt and insisted that interest on loans be met.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1992"/&gt; It entailed the balancing of the budget through expenditure and wage cuts, without additional overseas borrowing, necessitating reductions in social welfare programs, defence spending and other sweeping cutbacks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/scullin/in-office.aspx |title=In office - James Scullin - Australia's PMs - Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Premiers and Prime Minister Scullin agreed to this ''Melbourne Plan'', which would go on to form the basis of the [[Premiers' Plan]]. [[Ted Theodore]], Treasurer in Scullin's Government, supported an ''inflationary'' policy of increased government spending in times of a recession, a view espoused in 1936 by [[John Maynard Keynes]]. The Senate and Commonwealth Bank (then also acting as the country's central bank) rejected Theodore's spending plans. The Labor Premier of New South Wales meanwhile announced the [[Lang Plan]] in February 1931, which included a temporary cessation of interest repayments on debts to Britain and that interest on all government borrowings be reduced to 3% to free up money for injection into the economy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1992"/&gt;

In 1929, as an emergency measure, Australia took the [[Australian pound]] off the gold standard, resulting in a devaluation relative to sterling. Starting in September 1930, the Australian banks began to slowly devalue the Australian pound, and a year later it had been devalued 30% against the Pound Sterling.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} This had the economic effect of increasing the cost of imported goods and increasing the cost of servicing government overseas debts, which were denominated in the overseas currency, typically in sterling. 

[[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], the Labor Party [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]] in [[New South Wales]] and a fiery left-wing [[populism|populist]], campaigned vigorously against the provisions of the Melbourne Agreement. He was elected in a landslide in the [[New South Wales state election, 1930|NSW state election of 1930]].

Scullin departed for an Imperial economic conference in London, necessitating an absence of five months, during which time he managed to secure reduced interest payments for Australia. With James Fenton as acting Prime Minister and Joseph Lyons as acting treasurer in his absence, Labor continued to negotiate Australia's economic response, with Fenton and Lyons advocating a more conservative fiscal approach and the unions and caucus calling for repudiation of debts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

In 1931 at an economic crisis conference in [[Canberra]], Jack Lang issued his own programme for economic recovery.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The ''Lang Plan'' advocated the repudiation of interest payments to overseas creditors until domestic conditions improved, the abolition of the Gold Standard to be replaced by a ''Goods Standard'' where the amount of money in circulation was linked to the amount of goods produced, and the immediate injection of £18 million of new money into the economy in the form of [[Commonwealth Bank|Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] credit. The Prime Minister and all other state Premiers refused.

With the rejection of the Theodore and Lang inflationary plans, the governments of Australia met to negotiate a compromise in 1931. The resulting [[Premiers' Plan]] required the Australian Federal and State governments to cut spending by 20%, including cuts to wages and pensions and was to be accompanied by tax increases, reductions in interest on bank deposits and a 22.5% reduction in the interest the government paid on internal loans.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1992"/&gt;

The policy contrasted with the approach put forward by the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] and which was pursued by the United States, which held that governments needed to ''spend'' their way out of the Depression. The plan was signed by New South Wales Labor Premier [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], but he was a notable critic of its underlying philosophy and went on to pursue his own policy of defaulting on debt repayments, which led to confrontation with the Federal Scullin and [[Lyons Government]]s and resulted in the [[Lang Dismissal Crisis]] of 1932.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/lyons/ |title=Joseph Lyons - Australia's PMs - Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Labor Party soon split into three separate factions. Jack Lang and his supporters, mainly in New South Wales, were expelled from the party and formed a left-wing splinter party officially known as the [[Australian Labor Party (NSW)|New South Wales Labor Party]], commonly known as [[Lang Labor]]. The Minister for Public Works and Railways, [[Joseph Lyons]], led a conservative faction, which believed in the deflationary approach of balanced budgets and cuts in spending and opposed defaulting on debt repayments.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; When the more radical Ted Theodore was reinstated as Treasurer by Scullin on 29 January, Joseph Lyons and James Fenton along with three others resigned from the government, joining the opposition Nationalist Party to form the [[United Australia Party]]. The Australian Labor Party would remain in government through the parliamentary term however, with Scullin as Prime Minister, and except for a brief stint by Scullin, Theodore as Treasurer.

==Lyons Government==
{{Main|Lyons Government}}

[[File:Joseph Lyons.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Lyons]], popular [[United Australia Party]] Prime Minister from 1932-1939. The [[Lyons Government]] supported the Premiers Plan and blocked Lang's efforts to avoid debt repayments.]]

The stance of Joseph Lyons and James Fenton against the more radical proposals of the Labor movement to deal with the Depression had attracted the support of prominent Australian conservatives, known as "the Group", whose number included future prime minister [[Robert Menzies]]. In parliament on 13 March 1931, though still a member of the ALP, Lyons supported a [[no confidence motion]] against the Scullin Labor government.  The [[United Australia Party]] was then formed from a coalition of citizens’ groups and with the support of the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]]. Lyons quit the ALP to become parliamentary leader of the newly established United Australia Party, with John Latham, Nationalist Leader of the Opposition,  becoming the new party's deputy leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/lyons/before-office.aspx |title=Before office - Joseph Lyons - Australia's PMs - Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1931, [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Lang Labor]] dissidents chose to challenge the Scullin Labor government and align with the United Australia Party Opposition to pass a ‘no confidence’ and the government fell. At the [[Australian federal election, 1931|1931 federal election]], the ALP were left with just 14 seats after losing 32 seats, though an extra 4 seats were won by NSW Lang Labor. The Lyons-led United Australia Party in [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] with the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] commenced its first term of government in January 1932.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Before being voted out of office, the Scullin government had covered NSW's debt default. The federal government had paid NSW's bond installments and intended to recoup this money from the NSW Government.  A dramatic episode in Australian history followed Lyons first electoral victory. When NSW Premier Jack Lang refused to pay interest on overseas State debts, the Lyons government stepped in and paid the debts and then passed the Financial Agreement Enforcement Act to recover the money it had paid. In an effort to frustrate this move, Lang ordered State departments to pay all receipts directly to the Treasury instead of into Government bank accounts. The [[Governor of New South Wales|New South Wales Governor]], Sir [[Philip Game]], intervened on the basis that Lang had acted illegally in breach of the state Audit Act and [[Lang Dismissal Crisis|sacked the Lang Government]], who then suffered a landslide loss at the subsequent [[New South Wales state election, 1932|1932 state election]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Carroll; ''[[From Barton to Fraser]]''; Cassell Australia; 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia would recover relatively quickly from the global financial downturn, with recovery beginning around 1932. Lyons pursued an orthodox fiscal policy, favouring the deflationary economic measures of the [[Premiers' Plan]], and refused to accept NSW Premier Jack Lang's proposals to default on overseas debt repayments. Australia entered the Depression with a debt crisis and a credit crisis. According to author [[Anne Henderson]] of the conservative&lt;ref&gt;Price, Susan and Boyle, Peter. Abbott's 'stronger', 'happier' Australia means more pain for the poor [online]. Green Left Weekly, No. 1007, 07 May 2014: 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sydney Institute]][https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Sydney_Institute], Lyons held a steadfast belief in "the need to balance budgets, lower costs to business and restore confidence" and the Lyons period gave Australia "stability and eventual growth" between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War. A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained, which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy - a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture. Lyons saw restoration of Australia's exports as the key to economic recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Henderson]]; ''Joseph Lyons: The People's Prime Minister''; NewSouth; 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A devalued Australian currency assisted in restoring a favourable balance of trade.

==Varying experiences of the Great Depression==

During the Great Depression, different parts of Australian society experienced different hardships, challenges and opportunities. There was increased movement of many people to and from country areas in search of work. City and urban people planted gardens to produce fruit and vegetables. In some urban areas co-operatives were formed based on barter systems to share what was available. Shacks were built on the outskirts of large cities to house some who lost their homes, for example near the beach at Garie in the Royal National Park south of Sydney. There has been anecdotal evidence of families resorting to living in caves with authorities turning a blind eye as there were no other accommodation available.

===Unemployed Australians===

For Australians, the decade of the 1930s began with problems of huge unemployment, because the fall of the stock markets on Wall Street reduced confidence throughout the world. Most governments reacted to the crisis with similar policies, aimed at slashing back government spending and paying back loans. The Australian government could do little to change the effects of the slump and the tough economic times ahead. This affected the country in many ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skwirk.com/p-c_s-56_u-418_t-1062_c-4093/VIC/10/The-Commonwealth-Governments-Response-to-the-Depression/The-Great-Depression/Australia-between-the-Wars/SOSE-History/ |title=The Commonwealth Government's Response to the Depression, The Great Depression, Australia between the Wars, SOSE: History Year 10, VIC &amp;#124; Online Education Home Schooling Skwirk Australia |publisher=Skwirk.com |date=1999-03-26 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of economic downturn, people’s lives changed drastically. Australia had supplied huge amounts of wool for uniforms during World War 1, and many exports helped Australia achieve a high standard of living in the 1920s. The majority of the people of Australia lived very well prior to the fall, so they felt the effects of the depression strongly. Because of the severe economic contraction, the reduction of purchasing goods, employers couldn’t afford to keep excessive workers. A five-year unemployment average for 1930-34 was 23.4%, with a peak of approximately 30% of the nation being unemployed in 1932. This was one of the most severe unemployment rates in the industrialised world, exceeded only by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kelly "100 years, The Australian Story" ABC Books 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Many hundreds of thousands of Australians suddenly faced the humiliation of poverty and unemployment. This was still the era of traditional social family structure, where the man was expected to be the sole bread winner. Soup kitchens and charity groups made brave attempts to feed the many starving and destitute. The suicide rates increased dramatically and it became clear that Australia had limits to the resources for dealing with the crisis. The depression's sudden and widespread unemployment hit the soldiers who had just returned from war the hardest as they were in their mid-thirties and still suffering the trauma of their wartime experiences. At night many slept covered in newspapers at Sydney’s Domain or at Salvation Army refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Retro Active Series 2 by Maureen Anderson, Anne Low, Jeffery Conroy and Ian Keese&lt;/ref&gt;

The limited jobs that did arise were viciously fought for. The job vacancies were advertised in the daily newspaper, which formed massive queues to search for any job available. This then caused the race to arrive first at the place of employment (the first person to turn up was usually hired.) This is depicted in the Australian film ''[[Caddie (film)|Caddie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timelines of the Great Depression|url=http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/Timeline.htm|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture and society===

[[File:Bradman chaired.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Don Bradman]] is chaired off the cricket pitch in 1930.]]

Extraordinary sporting successes did something to alleviate the spirits of Australians during the economic downturn. In a [[Sheffield Shield]] cricket match at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in 1930, [[Don Bradman]], a young New South Welshman of just 21 years of age wrote his name into the record books by smashing the previous highest batting score in first-class cricket with 452 runs not out in just 415 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/donbradman/ |title=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=7 April 2008 |accessdate=2011-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040101185143/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/donbradman/ |archivedate=1 January 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising star's world-beating cricketing exploits were to provide much needed joy to Australians through the emerging [[Great Depression]] and Post World War One recovery.

Between 1929 and 1931 the racehorse [[Phar Lap]] dominated Australia's racing industry, at one stage winning fourteen races in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum Victoria |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/pharlap/horse/winner.asp |title=Museumvictoria.com.au |publisher=Museumvictoria.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous victories included the 1930 [[Melbourne Cup]], following an assassination attempt and carrying 9 stone 12 pounds weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum Victoria |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/pharlap/horse/cup.asp |title=Museumvictoria.com.au |publisher=Museumvictoria.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phar Lap sailed for the United States in 1931, going on to win North America's richest race, the [[Agua Caliente Handicap]] in [[Tijuana]], Mexico, in 1932. Soon after, on the cusp of US success, Phar Lap developed suspicious symptoms and died. Theories swirled that the champion race horse had been poisoned and a devoted Australian public went into shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum Victoria |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/pharlap/leaving/death.asp |title=Museumvictoria.com.au |publisher=Museumvictoria.com.au |date=6 April 1932 |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1938 British Empire Games]] were held in Sydney at the Cricket Ground from 5–12 February, timed to coincide with Sydney's sesqui-centenary (150 years since the foundation of British settlement in Australia).

==1932–1939: A slow recovery==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2011}}

Unlike the United States, where [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s inflationary [[New Deal]] attempted to stimulate the American economy, New Zealand where [[Michael Joseph Savage|Michael Savage]]'s pioneering [[welfare state]] tried to reduce hardship, or the United Kingdom where rearmament (from 1936) increased deficit spending, there was no significant mechanism for inflationary Keynesian economic policy responses in Australia.

Australia's recovery during the 1930s was led by the manufacturing sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics (1938). |url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/BB4B53E36314F93CCA2573AD002005D0/$File/13010_1938%20section%2024.pdf |title=Year Book Australia, 1938 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=February 1939 |accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federation in 1901 had granted only limited power to the federal government. For example, income taxes were collected by the State governments. Some argued that Australia's [[protectionist]] high tariffs worked to hurt the economy and that influential interest groups sought no change in this aspect of policy. Additionally, there was no significant banking reform or [[nationalisation]] of private businesses.

The devaluation of the Australian pound, abandonment of the Gold Standard, recovery of major trading partners like the United Kingdom and [[public works]] projects instituted by State and [[local government]]s led to a slow recovery. Unemployment, which peaked at 32% in 1932, was 11% at the start of the [[Second World War]] compared to 17.2% in the United States.

==Legacy of the Great Depression in Australia==
Following Lyons' death in 1939, [[Robert Menzies]] assumed the United Australia Party leadership and the prime ministership, however the [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. A year later, Menzies' [[minority government]] was brought down in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] when the two independents [[Crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] and switched their support to Labor, bringing [[John Curtin]] to power during [[World War II]]. At the [[Australian federal election, 1943|1943 federal election]], Curtin led Labor to their greatest House of Representatives victory both in terms of proportion of seats and their strongest national two-party vote. Curtin died in 1945 however, and was succeeded as Labor leader and prime minister by [[Ben Chifley]], who would lead Labor to their first successful federal re-election attempt at the [[Australian federal election, 1946|1946 federal election]], before their defeat at the [[Australian federal election, 1949|1949 federal election]] by the Menzies-led [[Liberal Party of Australia]] in [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] with the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]]. The [[Ben Chifley#Legislative achievements|comprehensive economic and social reforms]] and reformist nature of the Chifley Labor government was such that between 1946 and 1949, the Australian Parliament passed 299 [[Act of Parliament|Acts]], a record until then, well beyond Labor's [[Andrew Fisher]]'s 113 Acts from 1910 to 1913.

Curtin and Chifley, who often used the spectre of another depression in their campaign rhetoric, utilised emergency wartime powers to introduce a [[command economy]] in Australia based on [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynesian]] principles. Unemployment was virtually eliminated in this period, being reduced to a record low of 1.1%.&lt;ref name="acoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/1301.0Feature%20Article142001 |title=A Century Of Change In The Australian Labour Market |date=3 October 2007 |work=Year Book Australia, 2001 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=29 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, income tax became federally controlled with the states conceding that the war effort needed a centrally controlled financial basis.

In 1944, Curtin announced the plan for a white paper on full employment. This white paper served a variety of roles; to establish the priority of full employment; to ensure the depression would not recur; and to propose ways to make these objectives possible. Dr H C 'Nugget' Coombs as director-general of the Reconstruction Ministry had major input into this policy. The economic theories proposed by J M Keynes in 1936 were a major influence on the white paper.

Between 1947 and 1949 Chifley also attempted to [[nationalization|nationalise]] the banking sector, arguing that public control over the finance industry would assist in preventing further depressions.&lt;ref name="apmchif"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/chifley/in-office.aspx |title=In office - Ben Chifley |work=Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=National Archives of Australia |accessdate=29 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans saw bitter and protracted opposition from the media, conservative parties and the banks themselves. The [[High Court of Australia]] ruled that the proposed nationalisation of banks was unconstitutional. The government [[Commonwealth v Bank of New South Wales|unsuccessfully appealed the decision in the Privy Council]].

In 1949, the combined perceived threats of international and domestic communism and industrial unrest along with the public's waning support for extended rationing and intervention following the close of the War saw the return of Menzies to the prime ministership. Though Menzies was a conservative, his sixteen subsequent years in power saw the government continue the use of [[Keynesian]] methods in economic policy as well as further expansion of the [[John Curtin#Legacy|Curtin]] and [[Ben Chifley#Legislative achievements|Chifley economic and social legacies]].

'''Presidential elections''' were held in [[Guinea-Bissau]] on 18 March 2012 following the death of [[President of Guinea-Bissau|President]] [[Malam Bacai Sanhá]] on 9 January. A run-off was set to be held on 29 April after being postponed by a week as announced by electoral commission chief Desejado Lima Dacosta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africareview.com/News/Bissau+run+off+delayed+to+April+29/-/979180/1384960/-/jvdir1/-/index.html |title=Africa Review – Guinea Bissau presidential run off vote delayed to 29 April |publisher=Africareview.com |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="postpone"/&gt; However, after a [[2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état|military coup]], the leading candidates were arrested and the election was cancelled. The junta's spokesman then announced plans to hold an election in two years, despite condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/23/bissau-angola-bauxite-idUSL6E8JNHFM20120823 | work=Reuters | title=Bissau government to review Angola Bauxite deal, calls it unfair | date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guinea-Bissau general election, 2014|General elections]] were subsequently held in April 2014.

==Background==
Following the death of [[Malam Bacai Sanhá]] on 9 January 2012, an early presidential elections were scheduled to be held within 90 days, in accordance with the [[constitution of Guinea-Bissau|constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jQ_g50A9P12C5ScvEpONCJS7PTZQ?docId=CNG.f8db5baad7ae448fa2cbc149e29e6ae8.01 |title=AFP: Guinea-Bissau leader Malam Bacai Sanha dies in Paris |publisher=Google |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

No president in the history of independent Guinea-Bissau has completed his term in office: Three presidents have been ousted, [[João Bernardo Vieira|one was assassinated]], and [[Malam Bacai Sanhá|another died in office]].&lt;ref name="news24"/&gt;

==Campaign==
[[Prime Minister of Guinea-Bissau|Prime Minister]] [[Carlos Gomes Júnior]] resigned on 10 February to run for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/content/un-mission-pleased-with-peaceful-election-in-guinea-bissau---143271766/180374.html UN Mission Pleased With Peaceful Election in Guinea Bissau] VOA News, 17 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A total of nine candidates contested the elections,&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/gw.html Elections in Guinea Bissau] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; five of whom ran in the [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2009|previous elections]] in 2009. Their campaign literature was said to be "largely recycled." Carlos Gomes Júnior and Kumba Ialá were said to be the frontrunners in the election.&lt;ref name="aljaz"/&gt;

Ialá's support base was primarily based on his [[Balanta people|Balanta]] ethnic group. Gomes Júnior had indicated he wanted to reform the armed forces, with which he had a tense relationship.&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/03/201231844554576763.html |title=Guinea-Bissau counts presidential poll votes – Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campaigning for the second round was due to start on 13 April and end on 27 April.&lt;ref name="postpone"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gvbgLiOwMBZ7IjjF0ZAVFJ31-qhw?docId=CNG.4950c0f67e13086fe38f02331e0333bb.6b1 |title=AFP: Guinea-Bissau second round vote delayed to 29 April |publisher=Google |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conduct==
[[UNIOGBIS]] spokesman Vladimir Monteiro said: "The election was held in a very peaceful manner. In the morning, participation was relatively weak but, all day long, leaders of the electoral body encouraged the people to go and vote, and it seems that people listened and went to vote because the participation finally increased." He also added that the election commission is mandated by the constitution to release the result within 10 days of the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Clottey |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/UN-Mission-Pleased-With-Peaceful-Election-in-Guinea-Bissau---143271766.html |title=UN Mission Pleased With Peaceful Election in Guinea Bissau |publisher=Voanews.com |date=18 March 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same night fears of military-linked violence increased with the assassination of the former head of military intelligence, Colonel Samba Diallo, just before midnight at a bar in the national capital of [[Bissau]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported witnesses as saying that soldiers had fired at him and then taken his body away, possibly to a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Afua Hirsch, west Africa correspondent, and agencies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/18/guinea-bissau-vote-president-military-coup |title=Guinea-Bissau votes to elect president but military overthrow feared &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian  |accessdate=15 April 2012 |location=London |date=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
No candidate was able to attain a 50% majority in the first round. The leading two candidates, Carlos Gomes Júnior and Kumba Ialá were set to face each other in a runoff election to be held on 22 April.

Five of the first round candidates complained that the poll had been fraudulent despite independent, international observers stating that it was conducted fairly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17462109 |title=BBC News – Guinea-Bissau set for presidential run-off |publisher=BBC |date=21 March 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Despite a peaceful campaign, there were fears of possible violence or a coup d'état if the army did not approve of the winner. UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] called for a "peaceful, orderly and transparent" election.&lt;ref name="news24"&gt;{{cite web|author=Location Settings |url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Guinea-Bissau-wraps-up-poll-campaign-20120316 |title=Guinea-Bissau wraps up poll campaign |publisher=News24 |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition leaders, led by Ialá, called for a boycott of the second round because they considered the election fraudulent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/Mar/22/guinea-bissau-candidate-says-wont-do-vote-runoff/ Guinea-Bissau candidate says won't do vote runoff] Associated Press, 22 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;with Ialá calling for new voter registration to take place and warned against campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17492067 |title=BBC News – Kumba Yala boycotts Guinea-Bissau presidential run-off |publisher=BBC |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/120413/guinea-bissau-army-seizes-parts-capital-attempted-coup |title=Guinea-Bissau: Soldiers arrest Prime Minister in apparent coup bid |publisher=GlobalPost |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20935">'''Happy slapping''' was a [[Fads and trends|fad]] originating in the [[United Kingdom]] around 2005, in which one or more people out of [[boredom]] attack a victim for the purpose of recording the assault (commonly with a [[camera phone]] or a [[smartphone]]). Though the term usually refers to relatively minor acts of violence such as hitting or slapping the victim, more serious crimes such as the [[manslaughter]] of a pensioner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10331547|title='Happy slapping' gang members admit killing Ekram Haque|work=[[BBC News]]|date=16 June 2010|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexual assault]] have been classified as "happy slapping" by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name=sexattack&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6970516.stm|title=Sex attack phone girls detained|work=BBC News|date=30 August 2007|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use with video technology==
The ease and general availability of video cameras in mobile phones means that such attacks need not be planned carefully beforehand and are more easily watched and circulated for entertainment. Some political and media commentators claim the craze was inspired by such television shows as ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'', ''[[Dirty Sanchez (TV series)|Dirty Sanchez]]'' and ''[[Bumfights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/tv-to-blame-for-happy-slapping-craze-1069006|title=TV to blame for 'happy slapping' craze |date=30 June 2005|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4539861.stm|title='Don't ban' slap attack TV shows|work=BBC News|date=12 May 2005|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=1972548|title='Happy Slapping' Spreads in London|first=Nick|last=Watt|date=17 May 2006|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"Happy slapping" started in the [[South London]] [[London Borough of Lewisham|Borough of Lewisham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4539913.stm|title=Does 'happy slapping' exist?|last=Akwagyiram|first=Alexis|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1620568,00.html|title=Happy-slap link to TV shows |last=Johnston|first=Chris|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=1 September 2016|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a format known as "Slap Happy TV", where a happy-slapping video would be recorded, and then watched by dozens of people like a TV show, but in the form of a montage. Videos of Happy Slapping were commonly circulated via Bluetooth on mobile phones. The first newspaper article to use the phrase "happy slapping" was "Bullies film fights by phone", published in The ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' on 21 January 2005, in which reporter Michael Shaw described teachers' accounts of the craze in London schools.

Gary Martin, writing on "The Phrase Finder" website described the phenomenon as: "Unprovoked attacks on individuals made in order to record the event, and especially the victim's shock and surprise, on video phones."&lt;ref name=phrases&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/170890.html|title=Happy slapping|first=Gary|last=Martin|work=phrases.org.uk|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin wrote that happy slapping "began as a youth craze in the UK in late 2004. Children or passers by are slapped or otherwise mugged by one or more of a gang while others record the event on video and then distribute it by phone or Internet. Initially the attacks were, as the phrase would have us believe, fairly minor pranks ... As the craze spread the attacks became more vicious – often serious assaults known in legal circles as grievous bodily harm."&lt;ref name=phrases/&gt;

==Legal consequences==

===Denmark===
When the international media attention surrounding attacks abroad reached a high point, a girl was sentenced to eight months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netavisen-sjaelland.dk/news.php?item.326 "8-måneders fængsel for 'happy slapping'"], ''Netavisen Sjaelland'', 9 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced on a number of counts including previous crimes. {{clarify|date=September 2016}}

A common punishment in 2007 was a fine or up to 40 days in prison, suspended if the attacker has no previous record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigsadvokat.dk/media/bilag/RI_17-2007_Bilag_til_redegorelse____244-246.pdf Oversigt over straffene i voldssager efter ændringen af straffelovens §§ 244–246], Prosecutor General of Denmark (Overview of punishments in cases of violence after change of §244–246); accessed 1 September 2016.{{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Banke [http://www.bt.dk/article/20060419/krimi/104190023 "Slap med bøde for 'happy slapping'"], BT.dk, 19 April 2006.{{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacker shall be liable to a fine or imprisonment for any term which does not exceed 3 years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislationline.org/documents/section/criminal-codes/country/34/javascript:void();|title=Criminal codes - Legislationline|website=www.legislationline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Happy slapping is judged as "simple battery" as defined by section 244 of the Danish Criminal Code.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===France===
In February 2007, an amendment aimed at criminalising "happy slapping" was added to a law "on the prevention of delinquency" by the [[Parliament of France]] based on a proposal from then [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/dossiers/prevention_delinquance.asp Legislative file], assemblee-nationale.fr; accessed 1 September 2016. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=INTX0600091L Law #2007-297], legifrance.gouv.fr; accessed 1 September 2016. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the anti-happy-slapping clause appears as the last part of Article 44, which also deals with ambushing law enforcement personnel. The law equates filming or photographing certain classes of violent crimes, including severe beatings and rape, with being an [[accomplice]] of such crimes. The law makes it illegal to broadcast the images of such crimes, punishable by up to 5 years in prison and/or a €75,000 fine.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The law does not apply to those who took the above actions in order to obtain evidence in court, or as professional [[journalism]]. Professional journalism is delimited in France by the "press card", which is awarded by a commission representing journalist unions and press organizations.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ccijp.net/ Commission de la carte d'identité des journalistes professionnels]''&lt;/ref&gt; As defined by law,&lt;ref&gt;Work Code, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CTRAVAIL.rcv&amp;art=L761-2 article L761-2], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CTRAVAIL.rcv&amp;art=L761-15 article L761-15], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CTRAVAIL.rcv&amp;art=L761-16 article L761-16]&lt;/ref&gt; a professional journalist is one whose main activity is professional paid journalism.

The bill was signed into law on 5 March 2007, despite some organizations, including [[Reporters Without Borders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21237|title=Communiqué|work=Reporters Without Borders|accessdate=30 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503213819/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21237|archivedate=3 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French chapter of [[Wikimedia France|Wikimedia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikimedia.fr/index.php/Communiqu%C3%A9s_de_presse/Projet_de_loi_prevention_delinquance Communiqué] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that this clause created a legal discrimination in criminal law between professional journalists and ordinary citizens practicing journalism. Specifically, it was argued that citizens filming incidents of [[police brutality]] and publishing such information online could be intimidated by law enforcement into remaining silent, or prosecuted for their actions. This criticism was relayed by the international media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1490130.ece Criticism of anti-"happy slapping" law], timesonline.co.uk, 9 March 2007.&lt;br&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07070/767887-96.stm Criticism of anti-"happy slapping" law], post-gazette.com, 11 March 2007.&lt;br&gt; [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/013/410gvlul.asp Criticism of anti-"happy slapping" law], WeeklyStandard.com, 14 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[French presidential election, 2007|French President]] Nicolas Sarkozy declared to Reporters Without Borders that "the spirit of the law is not to infringe of freedom of information. However, if the least doubt subsisted, then I'm in favour of a clarification of the law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/imprimer.php3?id_article=21704 Communiqué] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930225940/http://www.rsf.org/imprimer.php3?id_article=21704 |date=2007-09-30 }}, [[Reporters without Borders|rsf.org]], 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Reponse_Sarkozy.pdf Nicolas Sarkozy comments on "happy slapping" legislation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181146/http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Reponse_Sarkozy.pdf |date=2007-09-30 }}, rsf.org; accessed 1 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In March 2008, a teenage girl who filmed the fatal beating of a man on her mobile phone was sentenced to two years' detention in the first prosecution of its kind in the United Kingdom. The judge stated that the courts had to make an example of such youths. She had pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court in February 2008 to [[aiding and abetting]] the [[manslaughter]] of Gavin Waterhouse, 29, from [[Keighley]], [[West Yorkshire]]. Mark Masters, 19, from Keighley, and Sean Thompson, 17, from Bradford, were sentenced to seven and six years respectively after admitting to manslaughter. Waterhouse died from a ruptured spleen after being beaten in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7244782.stm?lsm|title=Happy slap attack girl guilty|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=14 February 2008|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_yorkshire/7244782.stm|title='Happy slap' death girl convicted|work=BBC News|date=14  February 2008|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/mar/18/happyslap.killing|title=Girl jailed for filming 'happy-slap' killing|work=The Guardian|date=18 March 2008|accessdate=1 September 2016|location=London, UK|first=Angela|last=Balakrishnan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before the attack, the girl was handed a mobile phone by one of the attackers and told to "video this", prosecutors said. She approached Waterhouse, asked for money, and recorded the subsequent attack. She was sentenced to serve a two-year [[Sentencing in England and Wales#Detention and training orders|detention training order]]. Police said they were satisfied with the court's decision. The Crown Prosecutor said "this is the first time a suspect in England and Wales has been successfully prosecuted for aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter, for the filming of an inaptly called 'happy slapping' incident".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-slapping-idUKL1884088120080318 "Suspect sentenced for aiding and abetting a 'happy slapping' incident"], news.com.au; accessed 1 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer''' ('''IXPE''') is a future [[space observatory]] with three identical telescopes designed to measure the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of [[X-ray astronomy|cosmic X-rays]].&lt;ref name='NASA News'&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-mission-to-study-black-holes-cosmic-x-ray-mysteries NASA Selects Mission to Study Black Holes, Cosmic X-ray Mysteries]. Karen Northon, ''NASA News''. January 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The mission will study exotic astronomical objects and permit mapping the magnetic fields of [[black hole]]s, [[neutron star]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova remnant]]s, [[magnetar]]s, [[quasar]]s, and [[active galactic nuclei]]. The high-energy [[X-ray]] radiation from these objects' surrounding environment can be polarized – vibrating in a particular direction. Studying the polarization of X-rays reveals the physics of these objects and can provide insights into the high-temperature environments where they are created.&lt;ref name='Foust2017'&gt;[http://spacenews.com/nasa-selects-x-ray-astronomy-mission/ NASA selects X-ray astronomy mission]. Jeff Foust, ''Space News''. January 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The IXPE mission was announced on January 3, 2017.&lt;ref name='NASA News'&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-mission-to-study-black-holes-cosmic-x-ray-mysteries NASA Selects Mission to Study Black Holes, Cosmic X-ray Mysteries]. Karen Northon, ''NASA News''. January 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is being developed by NASA's [[Small Explorer program]] (SMEX) and is slated for launch in 2021.&lt;ref name='SPIE 2017'/&gt; The estimated cost of the mission and its two-year operation is $188 million.&lt;ref name='Foust2017'/&gt;  The goal of the IXPE mission is to expand understanding of high-energy [[Astrophysics|astrophysical processes]] and sources, in support of NASA's first science objective in astrophysics: "Discover how the universe works."&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt; By obtaining X-ray polarimetry and polarimetric imaging of cosmic sources, IXPE addresses two specific science objectives: to determine the radiation processes and detailed properties of specific cosmic X-ray sources or categories of sources; and to explore general relativistic and quantum effects in extreme environments.&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt;&lt;ref name='NASA News'/&gt;

During IXPE's two-year mission, it will study targets such as [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]], [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[pulsar wind nebula]]e, [[magnetar]]s, [[X-ray binary|accreting X-ray binaries]], [[supernova remnant]]s, and the [[Galactic center]].&lt;ref name='Weisskopf 2016'/&gt; 

The spacecraft is being built by [[Ball Aerospace]].&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt; The Principal Investigator is [[Martin Weisskopf]] of NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]; he is the chief scientist for [[X-ray astronomy]] at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and project scientist for the [[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]] spacecraft.&lt;ref name='Foust2017'/&gt;

===International collaboration===

The IXPE mission is an international collaboration signed on June 2017.&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt; The X-ray [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] detectors will be provided by the [[Italian Space Agency]] (ASI).&lt;ref name='Foust2017'/&gt;  Brian Ramsey is leading the effort to produce the grazing-incidence X-ray mirrors at NASA/MSFC. Other partners include the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], [[Stanford University]], [[McGill University]] in Canada, and MIT ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]).&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt;

==Objectives==

The technical and science objectives include: &lt;ref name=&lt;'IXPE home'&gt; [https://ixpe.msfc.nasa.gov/index.html IXPE: Expanding the X-ray View of the Universe]. NASA. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*improving polarization sensitivity by two orders of magnitude over the X-ray [[polarimeter]] aboard the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory|Orbiting Solar Observatory 8]]
*providing simultaneous spectral, spatial, and temporal measurements
*determining the geometry and the emission mechanism of Active Galactic Nuclei and microquasars 
*finding the magnetic field configuration in magnetars and determining the magnitude of the field 
*finding the mechanism for X ray production in pulsars (both isolated and accreting) and the geometry 
*determining how particles are accelerated in [[pulsar wind nebula]]

The space observatory features three identical telescopes designed to measure the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of [[X-ray astronomy|cosmic X-rays]].&lt;ref name='NASA News'/&gt; The system was invented and developed by Italian scientists and refined over the past 15 years  by the Italian [[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare]] (INFN).&lt;ref name='Weisskopf 2016'&gt; [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221137971630448X The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE)]. Martin C. Weisskopf, Brian Ramsey, Stephen L. O’Dell, et al. ''Results in Physics.'' Volume 6, 2016, Pages 1179-1180. {{doi|10.1016/j.rinp.2016.10.021}} &lt;/ref&gt; 
;Principle
IXPE's payload is a set of three identical imaging X-ray polarimetry systems mounted on a common optical bench and co-aligned with the pointing axis of the spacecraft.&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt; Each system operates independently for redundancy, and comprises a 4-meter focal length mirror module assembly that focuses X-rays onto a polarization-sensitive imaging [[X-ray astronomy detector|detector]] developed in Italy.&lt;ref name=eoPortal/&gt; The focal length is achieved using a deployable boom. 

The Gas Pixel Detectors (GPD) utilize the [[anisotropy]] of the emission direction of [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectrons]] produced by polarized photons to gauge with high sensitivity the polarization state of X-rays interacting in a gaseous medium.&lt;ref name='Weisskopf 2016'/&gt; Position- and energy-dependent polarization maps of such synchrotron-emitting sources will elucidate the magnetic field structure of the X-ray emitting regions. X-ray polarimetric imaging better indicates the magnetic structure in regions of strong electron acceleration. The system is capable to resolve point sources from surrounding [[Emission nebula|nebular emission]] or from adjacent point sources.&lt;ref name='Weisskopf 2016'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6183">'''Interserie''' is the name of a [[Europe]]an-based motorsport series started in 1970 that allows for a wide variety of racing cars from various eras and series to compete with less limited rules than in other series.

Created in 1970 by German Gerhard Härle, it is inspired by English races of the 1960s for [[Group 7 (racing)|Group 7]] machinery and by the [[Nordic Challenge Cup]] which had run in 1969 in Finland and Sweden. Initially using the [[Group 7 (racing)|Group 7]] formula similar to that used by [[Can-Am]] in [[North America]], the series would evolve to include [[open-wheel racing|open-wheel]] cars with sports-car style full bodywork from [[Champ Car|CART]], [[Formula One]], [[Formula 3000]], [[Formula 3]] and various other series, as well as [[Group C]] sports cars.

Although the teams are not as limitless in their modifications or powerplants, the series continues to run today, mostly with various open-wheel cars without full bodywork that became obsolete in current championship series.

Starting from 1999, the Interserie lost its international status and became a Central European championship with sprint races organised by the [[Automobilclub von Deutschland]], mostly for modified formula cars.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Komagata Maru'' incident}}
[[File:Komogata Maru LAC a034014 1914.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Sikhs aboard ''Komagata Maru'' in Vancouver's [[Burrard Inlet]], 1914]]
{{History of Vancouver}}
The '''''Komagata Maru'' incident''' involved the Japanese [[steamship]] ''[[Komagata Maru]]'' on which a group of citizens of the [[British Raj]] attempted to emigrate to Canada in 1914 but were denied entry and forced return to Calcutta (present day Kolkata), India. There they were fired upon by British police resulting in the deaths of 20 Sikhs.

''Komagata Maru'' sailed from [[British Hong Kong]], via Shanghai, [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]], and [[Yokohama]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], to [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, in 1914, carrying 376 passengers from [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]], [[British Raj|British India]]. Of them, 24 were admitted to Canada, but the other 352 passengers were not allowed to disembark in Canada, and the ship was forced to return to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Voyage of the Komagata Maru: the Sikh challenge to Canada's colour bar|year=1989|publisher=University of British Columbia Press| location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-7748-0340-3|pages=81, 83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passengers comprised 340 [[Sikh]]s, 24 Muslims, and 12 Hindus, all [[British subject]]s. This was one of several incidents in the early 20th century in which exclusion laws in Canada and the United States were used to exclude immigrants of Asian origin.

==Immigration controls in Canada==
{{main|Continuous journey regulation}}
Within the British Empire, the main class of people who were not British subjects were the rulers of native states formally under the protection of the British Crown, and their subjects. Many such smaller states, especially in India, were for most practical purposes administered by the imperial government, but sovereignty rested in their rulers and not in the British Crown, and all such persons were (and still are) considered to have been born outside the sovereignty and allegiance of the Crown, and are known as British Protected Persons.

The Canadian government's first attempt to restrict immigration from India was an [[Order in Council]] passed on January 8, 1908, that prohibited immigration of persons who "in the opinion of the Minister of the Interior" did not "come from the country of their birth or citizenship by a continuous journey and or through tickets purchased before leaving their country of their birth or nationality". In practice this [[continuous journey regulation]] applied only to ships that began their voyage in India, as the great distance usually necessitated a stopover in Japan or Hawaii. These regulations came at a time when Canada was accepting huge numbers of immigrants, almost all of whom came from Europe. More than 400,000 arrived in 1913, an annual figure that has not been equaled since.

==Gurdit Singh's initial idea==
{{cquote|The visions of men are widened by travel and contacts with citizens of a free country will infuse a spirit of independence and foster yearnings for freedom in the minds of the emasculated subjects of alien rule.|x|x|Gurdit Singh}}

[[File:Baba Gurdit Singh.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Portrait of Baba Gurdit Singh, Komagata Maru Memorial, [[Budge Budge]]]]
[[Baba Gurdit Singh|Gurdit Singh Sandhu]], from [[Sarhali]] (not to be confused with Gurdit Singh Jawanda from [[Haripur Khalsa]], a 1906 Indo-Canadian immigration pioneer), was a [[British Singapore|Singaporean]] fisherman who was aware that Canadian exclusion laws were preventing Punjabis from immigrating there. He wanted to circumvent these laws by hiring a boat to sail from [[Calcutta]] to Vancouver. His aim was to help his compatriots whose previous journeys to Canada had been blocked.

Though Gurdit Singh was apparently aware of regulations when he chartered the ship ''Komagata Maru'' in January 1914,&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, H., op. cit., p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; he continued with his enterprise to challenge the continuous journey regulation in the hopes of opening the door for immigration from India to Canada.

At the same time, in January 1914, he publicly espoused the [[Ghadar Party|Ghadarite]] cause while in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, H., op. cit., pp. 24 and 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ghadar Party was an organization founded by Indian residents of the United States and Canada in June 1913 with the aim of liberating India from British rule. It was also known as the Hindi Association of the Pacific Coast.

===Passengers===
The passengers consisted of 340 [[Sikh]]s, 24 Muslims, and 12 Hindus, all [[British subject]]s. One of the Sikh passengers, Jagat Singh Thind, was the youngest brother of [[Bhagat Singh Thind]], an Indian-American Sikh writer and lecturer on "spiritual science" who was involved in an important legal battle over the rights of Indians to obtain U.S. citizenship ([[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhagatsinghthind.com/Komagata_maru.php |title=Komagata Maru |work=www.bhagatsinghthind.com |accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Government made claims that amongst the passengers were a number of Indian nationalists intent on creating disorder (see [[Ghadar conspiracy]], [[Annie Larsen arms plot]], and [[Christmas Day Plot]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000272/19140721/056/0004;|title=Register – British Newspaper Archive|first=The British Newspaper|last=Archive|website=www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However this was a public relations cover for its real motive for turning back the ship – a dislike of and discrimination against Indian nationals due to their ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Hugh J. M. The Voyage of the Komagata Maru: the Sikh Challenge to Canada's Colour Bar. Delhi: Oxford University Press. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voyage==
===Departure from Hong Kong===
Hong Kong became the point of departure. The ship was scheduled to leave in March, but Singh was arrested for selling tickets for an illegal voyage. After several months he was released on bail and given permission by [[Francis Henry May]], the Governor of Hong Kong, to set sail. The ship departed on April 4 with 165 passengers. More passengers joined at Shanghai on April 8, and the ship arrived at Yokohama on April 14. It left Yokohama on May 3 with its complement of 376 passengers and sailed into [[Burrard Inlet]], near Vancouver, on May 23. The [[Indian nationalism|Indian Nationalist]] revolutionaries [[Maulavi Barkatullah|Barkatullah]] and [[Bhagwaan Singh Giani (priest)|Bhagwaan Singh Giani]] met with the ship en route. Bhagwaan Singh Giani was head priest of the [[Gurdwara]] in Vancouver and had been one of three delegates sent to London and India to represent the case of [[Indo-Canadians|Indians in Canada]]. [[Ghadar Party|Ghadarite]] literature was disseminated on board and political meetings took place on board. A passenger told a British officer: {{where|date=May 2016}}"This ship belongs to the whole of India, this is a symbol of the honour of India and if this was detained, there would be [[Indian Mutiny|mutiny]] in the armies".{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Arrival in Vancouver===
[[File:Komagata Maru and Rainbow.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Komagata Maru'' (furthest ship on the left) being escorted by {{HMCS|Rainbow|1891|6}} and a swarm of small boats]]

When '' Maru'' arrived in Canadian waters, first at Coal Harbour in Burrard Inlet some 200 meters off CPR Pier A, it was not allowed to dock. The first immigration officer to meet the ship in Vancouver was [[Cyclone Taylor|Fred "Cyclone" Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, E., ''Cyclone Taylor: A Hockey Legend'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Robert Borden]] decided what to do with the ship, the [[British Columbia Conservative Party|Conservative]] [[Premier of British Columbia]], [[Richard McBride]], gave a categorical statement that the passengers would not be allowed to disembark. Conservative MP [[H. H. Stevens]] organized a public meeting against allowing the ship's passengers to disembark and urged the government to refuse to allow the ship to remain. Stevens worked with immigration official Malcolm R.J. Reid to keep the passengers off shore. Reid's intransigence, supported by Stevens, led to mistreatment of the passengers on the ship and prolonged its departure date, which was not resolved until the intervention of the federal Minister of Agriculture, [[Martin Burrell]], MP for [[Yale—Cariboo]].{{when|date=May 2016}}

Meanwhile, a "shore committee" had been formed with [[Hassan Rahim]] and [[Sohan Lal Pathak]]. Protest meetings were held in Canada and the United States. At one, held in [[Dominion Hall]], Vancouver, the assembly resolved that if the passengers were not allowed off, Indo-Canadians should follow them back to India to start a rebellion or ''[[Ghadar Mutiny|Ghadar]]''. A British government agent who infiltrated the meeting wired government officials in London and Ottawa to tell them that supporters of the [[Ghadar Party]] were on the ship.
 
The shore committee raised $22,000 as an installment for chartering the ship. They also launched a lawsuit under [[J. Edward Bird]]'s legal counsel on behalf of Munshi Singh, one of the passengers. On July 6, the full bench of the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] delivered a unanimous judgement that under new orders-in-council it had no authority to interfere with the decisions of the Department of Immigration and Colonization.&lt;ref&gt;Re Munshi Singh (1914), 20 B.C.R. 243 (B.C.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; Angry passengers relieved the Japanese captain of control of the ship, but the Canadian government ordered the harbour tug ''Sea Lion'' to push the ship out to sea. On July 19, the angry passengers mounted an attack. The next day the Vancouver newspaper ''[[The Vancouver Sun|The Sun]]'' reported: "Howling masses of Hindus showered policemen with lumps of coal and bricks&amp;nbsp;... it was like standing underneath a coal chute".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Departure from Vancouver===
[[File:Inspector Reid, H.H. Stevens and Capt. Walter J. Hose on board the "Komagata Maru".jpg|left|thumb|Inspector Reid, [[H. H. Stevens]] and [[Walter Hose]] on board ''Komagata Maru''.]]
The government also mobilized {{HMCS|Rainbow|1891|6}}, a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] ship &lt;!--standing idle in [[Esquimalt]].!--&gt; under the command of Commander Hose, with troops from the [[The Irish Fusiliers of Canada (The Vancouver Regiment)|11th Regiment "Irish Fusiliers of Canada"]], [[72nd Regiment "Seaforth Highlanders of Canada"]], and the [[6th Regiment "The Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles"]]. In the end, only twenty passengers were admitted to Canada, since the ship had violated the exclusion laws, the passengers did not have the required funds, and they had not sailed directly from India. The ship was turned around and forced to depart for Asia on July 23.

During the controversy, Punjabi residents of Canada had supplied information to [[W. C. Hopkinson]], a British immigration official. Two of these informants were murdered in August 1914. Hopkinson was gunned down at the Vancouver courthouse while attending the Punjabi trials in October 1914.

===Firing at harbour on return to India===
''Komagata Maru'' arrived in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] on September 27. Upon entry into the harbour, the ship was stopped by a British gunboat, and the passengers were placed under guard. The government of the British Raj saw the men on ''Komagata Maru'' not only as self-confessed lawbreakers, but also as dangerous political agitators. The British government suspected that white and South Asian radicals were using the incident to create rebellion among South Asians in the Pacific Northwest. When the ship docked at [[Budge Budge]], the police went to arrest Baba Gurdit Singh and the twenty or so other men that they viewed as leaders. He resisted arrest, a friend of his assaulted a policeman, and a general riot ensued. Shots were fired and nineteen of the passengers were killed. Some escaped, but the remainder were arrested and imprisoned or sent to their villages and kept under village arrest for the duration of the First World War. This incident became known as the [[Budge Budge riot]].

Ringleader Gurdit Singh Sandhu managed to escape and lived in hiding until 1922. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] urged him to give himself up as a "true patriot". When he did so he was imprisoned for five years.

==Significance==

The ''Komagata Maru'' incident was widely cited at the time by Indian groups to highlight discrepancies in Canadian immigration laws. Further, the inflamed passions in the wake of the incident were widely cultivated by the Indian revolutionary organisation, the [[Ghadar Party]], to rally support for its aims. In a number of meetings ranging from California in 1914 to the Indian diaspora, prominent Ghadarites including [[Maulavi Barkatullah|Barkatullah]], [[Tarak Nath Das]], and [[Sohan Singh Bhakna|Sohan Singh]] used the incident as a rallying point to recruit members for the Ghadar movement, most notably in support of [[Hindu–German Conspiracy|promulgating plans]] to coordinate a massive uprising in India. Their efforts failed due to lack of support from the general population.

==Legacy==
===India===
[[File:Komagata.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Komagata Maru Memorial'' at [[Budge Budge]]]]
In 1952 the Indian government set up a memorial to the ''Komagata Maru'' martyrs near the [[Budge Budge]]. It was inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. The monument is locally known as the ''Punjabi Monument'' and is modelled as a [[kirpan]] (dagger) rising up toward the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chakraborti Lahiri|first1=Samhita|title=Ship of Defiance| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100926/jsp/calcutta/story_12979265.jsp|accessdate=February 28, 2015|publisher=The Telegraph| date=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tripartite agreement was signed between the Kolkata Port Trust, Union Ministry of Culture and the ''Komagata Maru'' Trust for the construction of a G + 2 building behind the existing memorial. The building will house an administrative office and library in the ground floor, a museum in the first floor and auditorium in the second. The total cost of the construction will amount to 24&amp;nbsp;million [[Indian rupee]]s (INR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Gurvinder|title=New building to honour Komagata Maru martyrs|url=http://www.thestatesman.com/news/bengal/new-building-to-honour-komagata-maru-martyrs/71895.html|accessdate=June 28, 2015|issue=Kolkata|publisher=The Statesman|date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 government of India issued two special coins, INR&amp;nbsp;5 and INR&amp;nbsp;100, to mark the centenary of the ''Komagata Maru'' incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=IANS|title=India commemorating 100 years of Komagata Maru|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/india-commemorating-100-years-of-komagata-maru/article6458812.ece|accessdate=November 3, 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
A plaque commemorating the 75th anniversary of the departure of ''Komagata Maru'' was placed in the Sikh [[gurdwara]] (temple) in Vancouver on July 23, 1989.

A plaque commemorating the 80th anniversary of the arrival of ''Komagata Maru'' was placed in the Vancouver harbour in 1994.

A monument in remembrance of the ''Komagata Maru'' incident was unveiled in July 23, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hager|first=Mike |title=Komagata Maru passengers remembered with Vancouver monument |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Komagata+Maru+passengers+remembered+with+Vancouver+monument/6978053/story.html |work=Vancouver Sun |date=July 24, 2012 |accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located near the steps of the seawall that lead up to the [[Vancouver Convention Centre#West Building|Vancouver Convention Centre West Building]] in Coal Harbour.

A stamp commemorating the 100th anniversary of the arrival of ''Komagata Maru'' was released by [[Canada Post]] on May 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Komagata Maru: Booklet of 6 International Stamps|url=https://www.canadapost.ca/shop/collect-stamps/all-details-2014/details-3-arpil-2014/p-413932111.jsf?execution=e1s1 |publisher=Canada Post |accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental apologies ===
In response to calls for the government of Canada to address historic wrongs involving immigration and wartime measures, the Conservative government in 2006 created the community historical recognition program to provide grant and contribution funding for community projects linked to wartime measures and immigration restrictions and a national historical recognition program to fund federal initiatives, developed in partnership with various groups. The announcement was made on June 23, 2006, when Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] apologized in the House of Commons for the [[Head tax (Canada)|head tax against Chinese immigrants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pch.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&amp;DocIDCd=CS060471]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502054401/http://pch.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&amp;DocIDCd=CS060471|date=May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2006, Prime Minister Harper made a speech at the Ghadri Babiyan da Mela (Festival of the [[Ghadar Party]]) in Surrey, B.C., where he stated that the government of Canada acknowledged the ''Komagata Maru'' incident and announced the government's commitment to "undertake consultations with the Indo-Canadian community on how best to recognize this sad moment in Canada's history".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/multi/pubs/ichr/annexes_e.cfm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129040305/http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/multi/pubs/ichr/annexes_e.cfm|date=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 3, 2008, [[Ruby Dhalla]], MP for [[Brampton—Springdale]], tabled motion 469 (M-469) in the House of Commons which read, "That, in the opinion of the House, the government should officially apologize to the Indo-Canadian community and to the individuals impacted in the 1914 ''Komagata Maru'' incident, in which passengers were prevented from landing in Canada."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=Journals&amp;doc=70&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=2 |author= Government of Canada |title=Journals |number=70 |date=April 2, 2008 |accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, 2008, [[Jason Kenney]], Secretary of State (Multiculturalism and Canadian Identity), announced the Indo-Canadian community would be able to apply for up to $2.5&amp;nbsp;million in grants and contributions funding to commemorate the ''Komagata Maru'' incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/minstr/arc_disc-spch/kenney/2008/20080510-eng.cfm] [http://www.pch.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&amp;DocIDCd=CJK073475]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129040258/http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/minstr/arc_disc-spch/kenney/2008/20080510-eng.cfm|date=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following further debate on May 15, 2008, Dhalla's motion was passed by the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=Journals&amp;doc=96&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=2 |author=Government of Canada |number=96 |title=Journals |date=May 15, 2008 |accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2008, the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia unanimously passed a resolution "that this Legislature apologizes for the events of May 23, 1914, when 376 passengers of the ''Komagata Maru'', stationed off Vancouver harbour, were denied entry by Canada. The House deeply regrets that the passengers, who sought refuge in our country and our province, were turned away without benefit of the fair and impartial treatment befitting a society where people of all cultures are welcomed and accepted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.leg.bc.ca/38th4th/votes/v080523.htm |title=Votes and Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia |publisher=Legislative Assembly of British Columbia |date=May 23, 2008 |accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2008, Harper appeared at the 13th annual Ghadri Babiyan Da Mela (festival) in Surrey, B.C., to issue an apology for the ''Komagata Maru'' incident. He said, in response to the House of Commons motion calling for an apology by the government, "On behalf of the government of Canada, I am officially conveying as prime minister that apology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Prime Minister of Canada |date=August 3, 2008 |url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=4&amp;id=2205 |title=PM apologizes for 1914 ''Komagata Maru'' incident |accessdate=November 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222071738/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=4&amp;id=2205 |archivedate=February 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=CP |date=August 4, 2008 |url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Politics/2008/08/03/6345366-cp.html |publisher=CANOE.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080806093424/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Politics/2008/08/03/6345366-cp.html |archivedate=August 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the Sikh community were unsatisfied with the apology because they expected it to be made in Parliament. Secretary of State Jason Kenney said: "The apology has been given and it won't be repeated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080803/komogata_maru_080803/20080803?hub=Canada |title=Sikhs unhappy with PM's ''Komagata Maru'' apology |publisher=CTV News |date=August 3, 2008 |accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own), which was involved in the expulsion of the ''Komagata Maru'', was commanded by a Sikh, [[Harjit Sajjan]], from 2011 until 2014. He later became Minister of National Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/bc-regiment-that-once-forced-out-the-komagata-maru-is-now-commanded-by-a-sikh/article18832286/ |title=B.C. regiment that once forced out the Komagata Maru is now commanded by a Sikh |last=Roberts |first=Nadine |work=The Globe and Mail |date=May 24, 2014 |accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 2016, Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] gave a formal "full apology" for the incident in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/pm-to-offer-full-apology-for-komagata-maru-incident-1.2854117|title=PM to offer full apology for Komagata Maru incident|date=April 11, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justin Trudeau apologizes in House for 1914 Komagata Maru incident|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/komagata-maru-live-apology-1.3587827|website=CBC News|publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Canadian play based on the incident is ''The Komagata Maru Incident'', written by [[Sharon Pollock]] and presented in January 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=The%20Komagata%20Maru%20Incident |title=The Komagata Maru Incident |publisher=Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia |date=July 24, 2011 |accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented again in 2017 by the [[Stratford Festival]], directed by Keira Loughran, starring [[Kiran Ahluwalia]].

The first Canadian novel based on the incident is ''Lions of the Sea'', written by [[Jessi Thind]] and published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Lions_of_the_Sea.html?id=Okk452lbaDsC |title=Lions of the Sea |publisher=Nalanda University Press|isbn=9781412217385 |date=2003-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 [[Diana Lobb]] cited ''Lions of the Sea'' as one of the first fictionalized South Asian perspectives on the ''Komagata Maru'' in her philosophical dissertation presented to the University of Waterloo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/5819/Diana%20Lobb%20Dissertation%203.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Canadian Literatures Beyond the Colour Line |publisher= University of Waterloo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several friends of the author suggested the title of the novel for the Sikh Heritage Museum of Canada Komagata Maru exhibition in 2014 which was subsequently titled "Lions of the Sea: The National Komagata Maru Exhibition." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Lions of the Sea Exhibition|url=http://shmc.ca/work/52/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Lions of the Sea'' is being adapted into a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salman Khan Films &amp; First Take Entertainment announce "Lions of the Sea" a feature film based on the "Komagata Maru incident"|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/salman-khan-films--first-take-entertainment-announce-lions-of-the-sea-a-feature-film-based-on-the-komagata-maru-incident-601101895.html|website=PR Newswire|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ajmer Rode]] wrote the play ''Komagata Maru'' based on the incident in 1984. In 1989, when Indo-Canadian community of British Columbia commemorated the 75th anniversary of the ''Komagata Maru'', Sadhu Binning and Sukhwant Hundal wrote a play Samundari Sher Nal Takkar (''The Battle with the Sealion'') and co-edited and produced first issue of Punjabi literary magazine ''Watan'' on the ''Komagata Maru'' incident.

[[Phinder Dulai]] wrote A Letter To The Maru - 1914-1994. The letter was a fictionalized narrative utilizing both public record documentation and archival material; the piece ran in 1998 in an issue of Rungh Magazine.

In 2004, [[Ali Kazimi]]'s feature documentary ''Continuous Journey'' was released. This is the first in-depth film to examine the events surrounding the turning-away of the ''Komagata Maru.'' The primary source research done for the film led to the discovery of rare film footage of the ship in Vancouver harbour. Eight years in the making, ''Continuous Journey'' has won over ten awards, including the Most Innovative Canadian Documentary at DOXA, Vancouver 2005, and a Golden Conch at the Mumbai International Film Festival, 2006. Also in 2006, Kazimi assisted broadcaster [[Jowi Taylor]] in obtaining a piece of red cedar from Jack Uppal's Goldwood Industries, the first Sikh-owned timber mill in British Columbia, as a way of bringing the ''Komagata Maru'' story and the story of Sikhs in Canada into the [[Six String Nation]] project. Parts of this wood now serve as kerfing strips on either side of the end block in the interior of ''Voyageur'', the guitar at the heart of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Six string nation : 64 pieces, 6 strings, 1 Canada, 1 guitar|last=Jowi.|first=Taylor|date=2009|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|isbn=9781553653936|location=Vancouver|oclc=302060380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] radio play ''Entry Denied'', by the Indo-Canadian scriptwriter [[Sugith Varughese]] focuses on the incident.

In early 2006, [[Deepa Mehta]], a film director, said she would produce a film about the incident titled ''[[Komagata Maru (film)|Komagata Maru]]''. On October 9, 2008, it was announced that she had recast the lead role in favour of [[Akshay Kumar]] and [[Shriya Saran]] with a budget of $35&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theindianstar.com/index.php?udn=2008-10-12&amp;uan=8042]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723090604/http://www.theindianstar.com/index.php?udn=2008-10-12&amp;uan=8042|date=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, filmmaker Ali Kazimi's book ''Undesirables: White Canada and the Komagata Maru'' was published by Douglas &amp; McIntyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/undesirables|title=Douglas &amp; McIntyre Publishers|website=www.dmpibooks.com|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [http://talonbooks.com/books/dream-arteries dream / arteries], written by Phinder Dulai, was published by Talon Books. The poetry book begins with a suite of poems that utilize archival records, public repositories, and online uploaded material never published before, including new photographs of the Komagata Maru from the Vancouver Public Library.

[[Simon Fraser University]] Library launched a website ''Komagata Maru: Continuing the Journey'' in 2012 funded by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada under the auspices of the Community Historical Recognition Program (CHRP). This website contains information and documents related to the ''Komagata Maru'' incident and a timeline that unfolds the details and supports teaching, research and knowledge about the ''Komagata Maru'' for school-aged, post-secondary and general audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://komagatamarujourney.ca/|title=Komagata Maru Journey|website=komagatamarujourney.ca|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claimed coincidences connecting [[U.S. President]]s  [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[John F. Kennedy]] are a piece of American [[Urban Legend|folklore]] of unknown origin. The list of [[coincidence]]s appeared in the mainstream [[Media of the United States|American press]] in 1964, a year after the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], having appeared prior to that in the ''G.O.P. Congressional Committee Newsletter.''&lt;ref name=Time640821&gt;[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,876021,00.html A Compendium of Curious Coincidences], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', August 21, 1964   {{cite web |url=http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/archive/preview/0%2C10987%2C876021%2C00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-16 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129101525/http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/archive/preview/0%2C10987%2C876021%2C00.html |archivedate=January 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsweek640810&gt;''[[Newsweek]]'', August 10, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Gardner]] examined the list in an article in ''[[Scientific American]],'' later reprinted in his book, ''The Magic Numbers of [[Dr. Matrix]]''.&lt;ref name=Dr_Matrix&gt;''The Magic Numbers of Dr. Matrix'' By [[Martin Gardner]]. 1985. [[Prometheus Books]]. Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 84-43183, {{ISBN|0-87975-281-5}} (cloth), 0-87975-282-3 (paper) (This was previously titled ''The Numerology of Dr. Matrix.''  It contains all of ''The Incredible Dr. Matrix'' plus four more chapters.)&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's version of the list contained 16 items; many subsequent versions have circulated much longer lists. The list is still in circulation today, having endured in the popular imagination for over 50 years. In 1992, the ''[[Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal|Skeptical Inquirer]]'' ran a "Spooky Presidential Coincidences Contest." One winner found a series of sixteen similar coincidences between Kennedy and former [[Mexico|Mexican]] President [[Álvaro Obregón]], while the other came up with similar lists for twenty-one pairs of US Presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/coincidences_remarkable_or_random/ | title=Coincidences: Remarkable or Random? | author=Martin, Bruce | journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=September–October 1998 | volume=22 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The list==
An example of the list is presented here for illustration. Some urban folklorists have postulated that the list provided a way for people to make sense of two tragic events in American history by seeking out patterns.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{Snopes | link=http://www.snopes.com/history/american/lincoln-kennedy.asp | title=Linkin' Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner and others have said that it is relatively easy to find seemingly meaningful patterns relating any two people or events.

&lt;!-- Please DO NOT expand this list. This is an article *about* the list, not a place to compile an even larger list. This short list is meant to be illustrative of the more common elements found in the various circulating versions of the list. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Please DO NOT fact tag this list. The sources are listed in the References section. Many of the items on the list are untrue - this is noted in the text. The list is here to illustrate the nature of the Lincoln/Kennedy Coincidences urban legend. This is an article about folklore; these items are no more expected to be verifiable than the plot of a fictional movie would be, yet it is perfectly acceptable to include a movie synopsis in Wikipedia. --&gt;

Coincidence (not part of the above list) - Both Lincoln and Kennedy were carried in coffins with no pallbearer's handles. Lincoln's body was placed in a plain pine box with no handles. It was carried out of the Petersen house with hands underneath the bottom of the box. Kennedy was placed in a bronze coffin, which wouldn't fit through the Eastern Airlines aircraft door; the pallbearer's handles were forcibly removed to board the plane (Lyndon Johnson boarded Air Force One as the newly sworn President).  Esquire Magazine; Manhunt, Swanson (2006).

==Musical legacy==
[[Buddy Starcher]] wrote a song recounting many of these coincidences and parallels between the two presidents' careers and deaths entitled "[[History Repeats Itself]]." It became a U.S. Top 40 hit for him during the spring of 1966,&lt;ref&gt;''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached number two on the [[Hot Country Songs|Country]] chart. [[Cab Calloway]] also scored a minor chart hit with the song that same year.

The '''Neuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festival''' ('''NIFFF''') is a Swiss film festival dedicated to fantastic movies. It was created in 2000 and is now renowned internationally as one of the foremost film festivals in the world for genre cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenanarchy.com/2016/06/the-neuchatel-international-fantastic-film-festival-announces-jam-packed-lineup-for-2016.html|title=The Neuchatel International Fantastic Film Festival Announces Jam Packed Lineup For 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIFFF defines itself through a rich and diversified programming, constructed around three central axes: Fantastic cinema, Asian cinema and Digital images. The films shown at the Festival are very diversified, ranging from major works by renowned directors to unknown and underground ''films d'auteurs''. Famous fantastic film directors have already honored the NIFFF with their presences, including [[George A. Romero]], [[Joe Dante]], [[John Landis]], [[Terry Gilliam]], [[Hideo Nakata]].

The NIFFF offers five competitions: an international competition, an Asian competition, a Best Swiss Short Film Competition, a Best European Short Film Competition and a Swiss Video Art Competition entitled Actual Fears and inaugurated in 2008.

Since its creation, the NIFFF has been programmed each year during the first week of July, except in 2001. In 2008, the NIFFF celebrates its eighth edition and counts amongst the major cinematographic events in Switzerland, supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Culture.

The '''Opiconsivia''' (or '''Opeconsiva''' or '''Opalia''') was an [[Roman festival|ancient Roman religious festival]] held August 25 in honor of [[Ops]] ("Plenty"),&lt;ref&gt;Sarolta A. Takács, ''Vestal Virgins, Sibyls, and Matrons: Women in Roman Religion'' (University of Texas Press, 2008), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as Opis, a goddess of agricultural resources and wealth. The festival marked the end of harvest, with a mirror festival on December 19 concerned with the storage of the grain.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Rufus Fears]], "The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), p. 838.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin word ''consivia'' (or ''consiva'') derives from ''conserere'' ("to sow"). Opis was deemed a [[chthonic]] (underworld, inside the earth) goddess who made the vegetation grow. Since her abode was inside the earth, Ops was invoked by her worshipers while sitting, with their hands touching the ground, according to Macrobius (Saturnalia, I:10). 

Although Ops is a consort of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], she was closely associated with [[Consus]], the protector of grains and subterranean storage bins (silos). Consus is therefore thought to be an alternate name of Saturn in the chthonic aspect as consort. The festival of Consus, the [[Consualia]], was celebrated twice a year, each time preceding that of Ops: once on August 21, after the harvest, and once on December 15, after the sowing of crops was finished. 

The Opiconsivia festival was superintended by the [[Vestals]] and the [[Flamen Quirinalis|Flamines]] of [[Quirinus]], an early [[Sabine]] god said to be the deified [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]].  Quirinus was absorbed by, and included in, the first and earliest [[Capitoline Triad]], along with Mars—then an agriculture god—and Jupiter. The main [[priest|priestess]] at the [[regia]] wore a white veil, characteristic of the [[vestal virgins]]. A [[chariot race]] was performed in the [[Circus Maximus]]. [[Horse]]s and [[mule]]s, their heads crowned with chaplets made of flowers, also took part in the celebration.

&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Lammas Fair.jpg|thumb|200px|The Auld Lammas Fair]] --&gt;
The '''Auld Lammas Fair''' is a traditional [[fair]] held in [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]], [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]] every year on the last Monday and Tuesday of August. It is associated with the [[Lammas]] [[harvest festival]]. 

The fair has been running for nearly 400 years, dating back to the 17th century.

Various goods are traditionally sold at the fair. These include livestock and traditional foods such as [[Yellowman (confectionery)|Yellowman]], a local variant of [[Honeycomb toffee|honeycomb]] and [[dulse]], a type of edible seaweed.

A [[ballad]] written by local shopkeeper and [[bog]]-[[oak]] carver John Henry MacAuley enhanced the local fame of the fair. MacAuley was also a well known [[fiddle]]r, but died in 1937 before his song became famous. 

On 28 August 2001 a [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] officer discovered a large [[incendiary bomb]] in the centre of Ballycastle whilst the fair was running. After the area was cleared [[British Army]] [[bomb disposal]] experts defused the device. The attempted attack was initially claimed by the [[Red Hand Defenders]]. However, the RUC later suggested that it was carried out by the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pilgrimage of the Relics''' or '''Maastricht Septennial Pilgrimage''' ({{lang-nl|Heiligdomsvaart van Maastricht}}) is a seven-yearly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] event in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] city of [[Maastricht]]. Originating in the Middle Ages, it developed from a [[pilgrimage]] to the grave of [[Saint Servatius]] into the present-day religious, historical, cultural and commercial enterprise. Highlights in the programme are the displaying or unveiling of the [[relic]]s in the main churches and secondly, the processions with the town's main relics. The next pilgrimage will take place in 2025.

== History ==
=== Maastricht as a pilgrimage town ===
[[File:20180531 Maastricht Heiligdomsvaart 15.jpg|thumb|The crypt of Saint Servatius in the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius|Basilica of St Servatius]]. The Frankish sarcophagus was added later]]
[[File:Toningsformulier relieken, OLV-kerk, Maastricht (begin 17e eeuw).jpg|thumb|Relics form issued by [[Basilica of Our Lady, Maastricht|Our Lady's]]. In the centre the Byzantine double cross]]
Maastricht had been an important destination for pilgrims centuries before the first recorded septennial pilgrimage. The first to mention pilgrims paying tribute at the grave of Saint Servatius was [[Gregory of Tours]] in the late 6th century. It was at that time that bishop [[Monulph]] replaced the wooden grave chapel with a stone basilica.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory of Tours]] (587): ''Liber in gloria confessorum'' ("The Glory of the Confessors"), chapter 71 ([http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/02m/0538-0594,_Gregorius_Turonensis_Episcopus,_Liber_De_Gloria_Beatorum_Confessorum,_MLT.pdf online text in Latin]).&lt;/ref&gt; Calendars of saints from the 8th and 9th century make mention of miracles happening at the saint's grave.&lt;ref&gt;Koldeweij (1990), pp. 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of pilgrims increased, the original church became too small. It was replaced by ever larger structures, until the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius|current church]] was built in the 11th century. Throughout the centuries the Church of Saint Servatius acquired many relics, which were housed in precious [[Reliquary|reliquaries]]. The [[indulgence]]s connected to these relics brought in more pilgrims. A French pilgrim calculated in 1453 that in one year in Maastricht one could earn about 800 years reduction of [[Purgatory|purgatorial]] punishment. At the same time, it was assumed that a completed Maastricht pilgrimage was rewarded with a plenarary indulgence (full remittance of punishment).&lt;ref&gt;Koldeweij (1990), pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other [[collegiate church]] in Maastricht, the [[Basilica of Our Lady, Maastricht|Church of Our Lady]], possessed important relics too. After the [[First Crusade]] (1096-99), two major [[True Cross|relics of the True Cross]] were acquired from [[Constantinopel]]. One was the so-called Pectoral Cross of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], which was set in a small golden [[triptych]]. The other was the Byzantine double cross or [[Patriarchal cross]], presented to the church by [[Philip of Swabia]]. Both reliquaries were donated to the pope by a former [[Canon (priest)|canon]] in 1837. They are now in the Treasury of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]]. Another reason for pilgrims to visit Our Lady's was the relic of the girdle of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], which remains in the church today.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The nowadays much venerated 15th-century statue of [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] only arrived in this church in 1837, and thus prior to that date had no role in attracting pilgrims to Our Lady's. Koldeweij (1990), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was great rivalry between the two principal churches when it came to attracting pilgrims. More pilgrims meant more income. The [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] of St Servatius, considering itself the oldest and more powerful institution, made sure that no relics were shown in the open air at Our Lady's. It has been suggested that the ambulatory gallery in the choir of Our Lady's was used for this purpose. Whichever way they showed their relics, it was almost certainly less effective than the spectacular open-air displays at St Servatius'. Over the centuries several disputes arose from this, some were fought at the highest level at the [[Roman Curia|Papal Tribunal]].&lt;ref name=delahaye116&gt;{{aut|R. de la Haye}}, 'Geschiedenis van de Maastrichtse Heiligdomsvaart'. In: Van Rensch/Koldeweij/De la Haye/De Kreek (1990), pp. 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt; The differences culminated in 1495, when the Chapter of Saint Servatius commissioned a copy of the Patriarchal Cross of Our Lady's.

For the benefit of the pilgrims two [[hospitium]]s were built on the south-west corner of [[Vrijthof]]. The Hospitium of Saint Servatius is first mentioned in the 11th century. Next to it stood the Hospitium of Saint James, which was specifically built for pilgrims on their way to [[Santiago de Compostella]]. Due to dwindling numbers of pilgrims, both institutions took on other tasks in the 17th century. They were demolished in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Koldeweij (1990), pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages: Apogee of the Maastricht pilgrimage ===
[[File:Toningsformulier heiligdomsvaarten Maastricht, Aken &amp; Kornelimünster (Midden-Rijn, 1468).jpg|thumb|Relics form of the 1468 pelgrimages of Maastricht, [[Aachen]] and [[Kornelimünster Abbey]]]]
The Dutch word ''heiligdomsvaart'' ([[German language|German]]: ''Heiligtumsfahrt'') means "journey to the holy relics". It is probably derived from the older German terms ''Römerfahrt'' and ''Aachener Fahrt'', the medieval journeys or pilgrimages to [[Rome]] and [[Aachen]]. The Maastricht ''heiligdomsvaart'' as of long was held simultaneously with Aachen and [[Kornelimünster Abbey]]. Together they offered some of the best relics to be seen in Europe. A [[papal bull]] of 1249 is the oldest document referring to the Maastricht pilgrimage around the traditional dates in mid-July, although the name ''heyldomsvaert'' is not mentioned until 1440. The term used in 1391 was ''heiligdomskermis'' ("fair of the holy relics"). The popularity of the Maastricht-Aachen-Kornelimünster pilgrimage reached its zenith in the 15th century when up to 140,000 pilgrims visited these towns in mid-July.&lt;ref&gt;De la Haye (1990), pp. 107-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The septennial pilgrimage in medieval Maastricht was centred around the Church of Saint Servatius, although Our Lady's and other churches undoubtedly benefitted with their indoors activities. The traditional date was one week before and one week after the 16th of July, the feast of the holy bishops Monulph and [[Gondulph]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In Aachen the pilgrimage centred around the 17th July, the dedication of [[Aachen Cathedral]]. It remains unclear whether this was a coincidence or planned. It was certainly hugely beneficial to both. Later Kornelimünster joined in.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known when this date became the focal point of the Maastricht pilgrimage but in 1289 [[auxiliary bishop]] Bonaventura of [[List of bishops and prince-bishops of Liège|Liège]] offered an indulgence to pilgrims visiting the grave of Saint Servatius around this time of the year. The year in which a septennial pilgrimage took place was a [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee]], which meant that extra indulgences were granted. The majority of pilgrims aimed to earn indulgences by visiting the grave of Saint Servatius, drinking holy water from the cup of Saint Servatius and attending at least one of the daily relics displays. No indulgences could be obtained without going to [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and doing [[penance]]. After fulfilling the requirements pilgrims received a pre-printed confessional certificate. A [[chaplain]] would fill in the name of the pilgrim and attach the seal of the church.&lt;ref&gt;De la Haye (1990), pp. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Maastricht the Collegiate Church of Saint Servatius had the sole right of showing relics in the open air. During the septennial pilgrimage this took place once a day at [[Vrijthof]] Square. In the 15th-century so many pilgrims gathered there, that the walls around the square had to be taken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Mischa Spel}}: [https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2003/09/12/het-graf-blijft-warm-7653684-a287065 'Het graf blijft warm'] on website ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 12 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; After celebrating an open-air [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]], a selection of the church's relics were shown from the [[dwarf gallery]], the arcaded gallery just below the [[apse]]'s roof. The dwarf gallery was decorated for the occasion with cloths printed with angels and Saint Servatius' keys.

The showing of the relics must have been a theatrical event during which many pilgrims were overcome with emotion. Throughout the ceremony loud cries could be heard.&lt;ref&gt;Van Os (2000), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Some pilgrims were sitting on rooftops around Vrijthof to get a better view of the relics and to benefit from their exposure.&lt;ref name=nrc90&gt;{{aut|Jacques Herraets}}: [https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1990/08/24/maastricht-in-de-ban-van-de-sint-servaas-6938837-a1061096 'Maastricht in de ban van de Sint Servaas'] in ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 24 August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Many took bread, meat and personal objects with them in order to be blessed by the relics. The relics were shown in four groups. Each group was announced with a formula that started with: "Thou shall be shown...", followed by a brief description of the objects and a prayer. The fixed order was: 1. the [[sudarium]] of Saint Servatius (one of the three "heavenly cloths", lost during the [[Siege of Maastricht (1579)|Siege of Maastricht of 1579]]) along with his [[crozier]]; 2. the red [[shroud]] of Saint Servatius along with his [[pilgrim's staff]]; 3. the white cloth that covered the [[sarcophagus]] of Saint Servatius, along with his [[chalice]] and [[paten]]; 4. the reliquary bust of Saint Servatius, the reliquary arm of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]] and the silver pectoral cross made by [[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke]] for the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name=kroos353&gt;Kroos (1985), pp. 353-355.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrims were then invited to visit the grave inside the church and see the other relics on display there.&lt;ref group= notes&gt;Many did visit the tomb of Saint Servatius, some lying on top of it and confessing their sins, as described by a pilgrim from [[Geraardsbergen]] in 1433. Koldeweij (1990), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was concluded by bell ringing and pilgrims blowing their pilgrim horns.&lt;ref&gt;De la Haye (1990), pp. 116, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pelgrimsinsignes Sint-Servaas, Maastricht3.jpg|thumb|[[Pilgrim badge]]s of Saint Servatius]]
Throughout the Middle Ages tens of thousands visited Maastricht during the septennial pilgrimage.&lt;ref group= notes&gt;There are no exact visitor numbers available. In Aachen 142.000 pilgrims visited in 1496. It is assumed that most of them visited Maastricht as well. De la Haye (1990), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Monasteries, hospitals, alms houses and individual citizens offered shelter, as only a limited number could be admitted to the town's official pilgrims' hospitiums.&lt;ref&gt;Koldeweij (1990), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilgrims came from all over Europe, notably from the [[Low Countries]], [[France]] ([[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] in particular, where Saint Servatius was venerated much), [[England]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (Germany, Austria and Bohemia), [[Hungary]] and [[Scandinavia]]. After visiting Maastricht many carried on to Aachen and Kornelimünster, or to other pilgrimage sites.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Maastricht [[pilgrim badge]]s have been found in most of the afore-mentioned countries. Five badges from Maastricht as well as French and Italian sites, stuck together as a result of oxidation, were found in a grave at [[Selje Abbey]] in Norway. It may be assumed that all five were collected during a single pilgrimage. Koldeweij (1990), pp. 90-91, 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrims were vital for the town's medieval economy. During the septennial pilgrimage the usually strict rules for trading were relaxed. Every citizen could sell food and drink or change currency.&lt;ref&gt;Ubachs/Evers (2005), p. 566: 'Vrijheid van Sint Servaas'.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilgrims were offered a range of religious souvenirs: pilgrim horns made of clay, pilgrim flasks made of [[white pipe clay]] and, most of all, [[pilgrim badge]]s made of tin or lead. In the 16th and 17th century these were gradually replaced by printed images, pilgrim's forms, booklets, medals and flags. The objects were often decorated with images of relics from Maastricht, Aachen and Kornelimünster, which made it easy to sell them in all three places.&lt;ref&gt;Koldeweij (1990), pp. 102-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourteen days of the Maastricht pilgrimage were known as the "Freedom of Saint Servatius". It was a period when normal rules did not apply, resulting in more freedom for citizens and visitors but also in more crime. The start of this period was announced by the town [[Watchman (law enforcement)|watchmen]] blowing their [[buisine]]s. From that moment on no-one could be tried for past offences. There was always a number of pilgrims who had been sent on a pilgrimage as part of a penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Koldweij (1990), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking the rules during this time was punished with forced pilgrimages (e.g. to Santiago de Compostella) or fines. [[Magistrate]]s and guilds formed [[militia]] that patrolled the streets, especially in areas where many pilgrims gathered. The large concentration of people in the relatively small city of around 15,000 also posed threats of fire and disease. Citizens were obliged to have a bucket of water on their doorstep to help prevent major [[conflagration]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ubachs/Evers (2005), p. 219: 'Heiligdosmvaart'.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 16th-17th century: Decline of the Maastricht pilgrimage ===
[[File:Bedevaartsouvenirs St-Servaaskerk Maastricht (16e-17e eeuw).jpg|thumb|Pilgrim's booklet and confessional certificates, 16th-17th century]]
The decline of the Maastricht pilgrimage in the 16th century was a result of the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]], as well as the ensuing [[European wars of religion|wars of religion]] and outbreaks of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. This affected Maastricht as much as many other places in north-western Europe.&lt;ref name=kroos353/&gt; The 1489 and 1552 pilgrimages were cancelled due to threat of war.&lt;ref&gt;Kroos (1985), p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De la Haye (1990), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Siege of Maastricht (1579)]] the three "heavenly cloths" went missing, whereas the reliquary bust of Saint Servatius was largely destroyed. Maastricht became a heavily defended Catholic bulwark. By 1608 attendance to the pilgrimage had dropped to 13,000. After the [[Capture of Maastricht]] by the Protestant [[Dutch Republic]] in 1632, a ban on processions and other religious manifestations in public was issued, meaning the end of the traditional ''Heiligdomsvaart''.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Processions inside the church or on church grounds were permitted. The 1629 ''Heiligdomsvaart'' had been the last pilgrimage with open-air displaying of the relics. Ubachs/Evers (2005), pp. 423-424: 'processie'.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrimages of 1655 and 1662 took place inside the Church of Saint Servatius. After 1706 no septennial pilgrimages took place until the revival of the tradition in the 19th century.

During the [[War of the First Coalition|French Annexation]] (1794-1814) the religious chapters in Maastricht were abolished. For some years both collegiate churches were used as military arsenals and horse stables. The church treasures suffered great losses in this period. Many objects of gold and silver were melted down in order to pay for war taxes. After the French period neglect continued. Some of the medieval reliquaries were sold to collectors or just given away. The church of Saint Servatius lost the four panels that belonged to the chest of Saint Servatius, as well as its ''[[Vera Icon (van Eyck)|Vera Icon]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]]. Our Lady's lost its Byzantine Cross and various other objects (see above). Few regretted these losses at the time. With the disappearance of the pilgrimages and the religious institutions that had guarded these objects for centuries, they had become meaningless to most.

=== 1874: Revival of the septennial pilgrimage ===
[[File:Bock &amp; Willemsen, Maestricht (1872) 14.jpg|thumb|Woodcut in [[Franz Bock|Bock]] &amp; Willemsen's ''Die mittelalterlichen Kunst- und Reliquienschätze zu Maestricht'' (1872)]]
[[File:Reliekenprocessie bij opening schatkamer St-Servaaskerk Maastricht, 1873 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Procession with relics at the opening of the [[Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius|Treasury]] (detail of a print, 1873)]]
[[File:Uilenspiegel, 16 augustus 1873, Heiligdomsvaart Maastricht.jpg|thumb|Caricature mocking the "cortège of relics" (''Uilenspiegel'', 16 August 1873)]]
From the mid-19th century Catholicism began to flourish once again in Maastricht and elsewhere in the Netherlands. Catholics' self-esteem was boosted by the [[reestablishment of the episcopal hierarchy in the Netherlands]] in 1853. Catholics now wanted to express their faith in public. In 1867 Joannes Paredis, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Roermond|bishop of Roermond]], reinstated the feast of the [[List of bishops and prince-bishops of Liège|holy bishops of Maastricht]]. Four years later he introduced the feast in honour of the relics of all saints.&lt;ref name=ss77&gt;{{aut|B. van Hellenberg Hubar}} (1983): 'Het omstreden herstel van de heiligdomsvaart in 1874'. In: ''De Sint Servaas'', pp. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; Many relics that had lost their containers during the French period were given new reliquaries, predominantly in the [[Gothic Revival]] style. At the same time, a renewed interest in medieval art became apparent. An important step in the reassessment of Maastricht's religious patrimony was the publication of [[Franz Bock|Bock]] and Willemsen's illustrated catalogue of the church treasures in 1872. The French edition of 1873 moreover contained additional texts about the medieval pilgrimages, which may have contributed to the revival of the tradition one year later. Also in 1873, the [[Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius|Treasury of the Basilica of St Servatius]], after extensive restoration works led by Dutch architect [[Pierre Cuypers]], opened to the public. Part of the opening ceremony was a short procession with several reliquaries that went from the old treasury via Vrijthof to the new treasury. The procession with three bishops and over 50 priests was illegal as it clearly ignored the ban on processions that was included in the 1848 [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Dutch Constitution]].&lt;ref name=ss77/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kroos (1985), pp. 396-397.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics in the Netherlands were impressed; others made fun of the "Maastricht cortège of relics".

The success of the 1873 procession stimulated  F.X. Rutten, [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of St Servatius', to reinstate the septennial pilgrimage in 1874. Papal permission was obtained from [[Pope Pius IX]], who also revived the medieval plenarary indulgence for those who completed the pilgrimage. The medieval custom of showing the relics from the dwarf gallery was not revived; instead the relics were exhibited in the church and during a procession. The relics remained on view for two weeks on a pedestal in the choir of St Servatius'. The route of the procession was the same as the previous year: leaving the church from the south-east portal, via Vrijthof and Keizer Karelplein to the north portal and the treasury in the cloisters. This time judicial action was taken against dean Rutten. The case went on for years; the dean persisted despite losing every single case.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Peter Jan Margry}} (2000): ''Teedere quaesties: religieuze rituelen in conflict. Confrontaties tussen katholieken en protestanten rond de processiecultuur in 19e-eeuws Nederland'', pp. 311-317. Uitgeverij Verloren, Hilversum. {{ISBN|90-6550-065-0}} ([https://pure.knaw.nl/ws/files/484520/Teedere_Quaesties.pdf online tekst op ''pure.knaw.nl'']).&lt;/ref&gt; This and similar cases led to heated discussions in Dutch Parliament. It did not stop the Catholics taking to the streets: in 1878 six processions were held in Maastricht and in 1881 the second 'modern' pilgrimage went ahead.&lt;ref name=ss77/&gt;

=== 20th century: Towards a modern pilgrimage ===
In the course of the 20th century Catholics were no longer regarded as a threat in the Netherlands, partly due to the fact that they had evolved from being a religious minority to a majority. Whereas processions and pilgrimages were previously regarded by non-Catholics as "catholic superstition" and "folklore", there was now a certain curiosity in this sensual approach to faith. Some Catholics regarded this new 'acceptance' with scepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Kroos (1985), p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Limburger Koerier vol 085 no 103 Heiligdomsvaart Maastricht 12-27 Juli.jpg|thumb|Announcement in the ''Limburger Koerier'', 1930]]
During the 1909 pilgrimage displaying of relics took place in the two main churches, as well as in the parish church of Wyck, where the so-called Black Christ of Wyck could be venerated. Masses were celebrated by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht|archbishop of Utrecht]] and the [[List of bishops and prince-bishops of Liège|bishop of Liège]], indicating the high profile the pilgrimage by then had achieved within the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Kroos (1985), p. 404, note 227.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 the Saint Servatius Play, a musical piece that intended to visualise the ancient legend, was performed in the open-air in Vrijthof. The play or variations on it were performed until recently.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The play ''The Golden House'' performed in 1983 led to criticism by the German art historian Renate Kroos, author of an important publication on the Shrine of Saint Servatius: "Höchst bedenklich dagegen scheint mir, daß bei diesem Aufzug (mit ca. 1200 Mitwirkenden und Kostümen von den Salzburger Festspielen) Reliquien 'mitspielen' mußten: der Thomas-Arm, die Staurothek von 1490, die Servatiusbüste und der Servatiusschrein. Einmal verbietet konservatorische Vorsicht, die gefährdeten Goldschmiedewerke von Schauspielern traktieren zu lassen." Kroos (1985), p. 406. Kroos' criticism did not have much effect; in the play ''Echo of a Pilgrim'' from 1990 relics were again being carried around. {{aut|J. van Term}} (1990): 'Heiligdomsvaart 1990: een terugblik'. In: ''De Sint Servaas'', pp. 422-425.&lt;/ref&gt; Another pre-19th-century element of the pilgrimage that was revived in the 20th century was the playful spectacle The Storming of the Castle, which took place on the river [[Meuse]] in 1930, 1937 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|B. Dohmen}} (1983): 'Maastricht gaat weer burcht op Maas bestormen'. In: ''De Sint Servaas'', pp. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ubachs/Evers (2005), pp. 103-104: 'burcht bestormen'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1937 the task of organising the septennial pilgrimage lies with the ''Vereniging Het Graf van Sint Servaas'' (Society of the Grave of Saint Servatius). The society aims to promote the city of Maastricht as a catholic centre and a pilgrimage site. Also in 1937, an old tradition was reintroduced to allow the statues of Our Lady, Star of the Sea and the Black Christ of Wyck in the procession. Several other non-reliquary objects (mainly statues of saints) have been admitted since.&lt;ref&gt;Kroos (1985), pp. 405-406.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1944 pilgrimage was cancelled because of [[World War II]]. It was postponed until 1948, thus breaking the seven-yearly cycle as well as no longer being synchronized with Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;Kroos (1985), p. 397, note 160.&lt;/ref&gt; It also meant that participants from Aachen were able to join the Maastricht procession. In 1955 the [[Bust of Charlemagne]] came over from Aachen, accompanied by many German pilgrims (among them cardinal [[Josef Frings]]). In 1969 the reliquary chest of [[Remaclus|Saint Remaclus]] was brought in from [[Stavelot]] and that of [[Gummarus|Saint Gummarus]] from [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]]; in 1976 [[Lambert of Maastricht|Saint Lambert]]'s bust visited from [[Liège]], [[Saint Ursula]]'s shrine from [[Cologne]] and other reliquaries from [[Oldenzaal]], [[Visé]], Aachen and [[Burtscheid]].&lt;ref&gt;Kroos (1985), p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1969 the traditional dates around mid-July were abandoned because too many people were away on holiday. Initially the dates were changed to late August, early September; later to late May, early June.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|J. van term}} (1989): 'Kom, wij gaan naar het huis van de Heer'. In: ''De Sint Servaas'', p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 a partnership with other pilgrimage sites within the [[Meuse–Rhine Euroregion|Euregion Meuse-Rhine]] was initiated. Unlike the medieval partnership with Aachen and Kornelimünster, the pilgrimages are scheduled in such a way that there is no competition between the towns. 1990 saw a dip in numbers of visitors, possibly a result of tensions in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Roermond|Diocese of Roermond]] under bishop [[Joannes Gijsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Bart A. Wiekart}}: 'De betekenis van de Katholieke Kerk', in: ''Vijftig jaar jaarboeken Maastricht'', p. 149 ([http://www.zichtopmaastricht.nl/pdf/VJJ-de_betekenis_van_de_katholieke_kerk.pdf online tekst] on website ''zichtopmaastricht.nl'').&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the theme was ''Where are you?'' with around 100,000 visitors. In 2004 the theme was ''We are the time''. It was the first time an extensive cultural programme was added to the pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kro.nl/katholiek/abc/heiligdomsvaart 'Heiligdomsvaart'] on website ''kro.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 theme was ''Towards the Light''.

The next Maastricht pilgrimage takes place in 2025.

The modern ''Heiligdomsvaart'' usually lasts 11 days. The centre of most activities is the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius|Basilica of St Servatius]]. The entrance to the church and treasury is free of charge at this time (normally there is a fee). During the pilgrimage the church can be accessed via three [[Portal (architecture)|portals]], two of which are generally not in use. The small [[crypt]], providing access to the grave of Saint Servatius, is also open at certain hours. The reliquary chest of Saint Servatius, locally known as the ''Noodkist'' ('Chest of Distress'), is permanently exhibited on the choir stairs. A secondary focal point during the pilgrimage is the [[Basilica of Our Lady, Maastricht|Basilica of Our Lady]]. To a lesser degree involved are the other churches in central Maastricht, as well as a number of (Catholic) schools, senior citizens homes and cultural institutions. The administrational centre of the pilgrimage doubles as an information point for both pilgrims and tourists.&lt;ref name=programma&gt;[http://www.heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl/nl/programma-c 'Programme Heiligdomsvaart 2018'] on website ''heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Masses and other services ===
The opening ceremony begins with a short service in the open air at the Spring of Saint Servatius in the [[Jeker]] valley, a few miles south of Maastricht. The service includes drinking water from the spring that, according to legend, sprung where Saint Servatius tapped his crozier on the ground. The opening ceremony continues at the Basilica of St Servatius, where the bust of Saint Servatius is carried around the church in procession, after which it makes its grand entry via the South Portal (''Bergportaal''), normally reserved for royal visitors. This is followed by a [[Pontifical High Mass]], celebrated by the bishop of Roermond, the dean of Maastricht and other priests. During this mass the ''Noodkist'' is brought into the church and placed on a platform on the choir steps, where it remains for the entire period.&lt;ref&gt;Fotoboek (2011), pp. 24-39, and [http://www.heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl/nl/impressies-hdv-2018/hdv-2018-processie-en-openingsmis-24-mei-2018 'Impressies HDV 2018: Processie en Openingsmis 24.05.2018'] on website ''heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt; During the next 11 days, high masses are celebrated every day, often aimed at certain groups. In 2018 masses and services were held for members of the [[Taizé Community]], the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]], the Community of the Crucified and Risen Love, the [[Society of St Gregory]], the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]] and the monks of [[St. Benedictusberg Abbey]]. Other groups that received a special welcome in the church included pilgrims to the shrine of [[Saint Gerlach]] in [[Houthem, Netherlands|Houthem]], pilgrims from [[Sint Oedenrode]] and [[Hasselt]], members of the [[Armenia]]n, [[Philippines|Philippine]] and [[Netherlands Antilles|Antillian]] communities in Maastricht, as well as children of primary schools in Maastricht. Furthermore, prayer services, [[Liturgy of the Hours|Liturgies of the Hours]], lectures and other spiritual activities are organised, some of which take place in the crypt, the Keizerzaal, or other unusual locations. Throughout the 11-day pilgrimage there are priests available for [[confession]] or personal counsel.&lt;ref name=programma/&gt;

=== Displaying of the relics ===
The ceremonies of the displaying of the relics in the two main churches constitute the spiritual highlight of the pilgrimage and refer – more so than the processions or other activities – to its medieval origin.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The Dutch novelist [[Nicolaas Matsier]] visited the Maastricht pilgrimage in 1997 and was most impressed by the relics display ("theatrically spoken, brilliant"). The procession, which had been his main goal, he considered disappointing. {{aut|Nicolaas Matsier}}: [https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1997/06/20/relieken-en-de-heiligdomsvaart-in-maastricht-een-hot-10448373-a998719 'Relieken en de Heiligdomsvaart in Maastricht; Een hot line met gene zijde']. In: ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 20 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern way of showing the relics is not from the dwarf gallery but inside the churches, first in the Basilica of Our Lady, followed by the Basilica of St Servatius.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Before 1990 the Basilica of St Servatius had no ceremony for displaying the relics; they were just on show in the church after the processions. In 1990 the relics display took place in both churches simultaneously. From 1997 on they take place at different times, so people can attend both events. Cf. the programmes of 'Heiligdomsvaart 1983' and 'Heiligdomsvaart 1990'. In: ''De Sint Servaas'', p. 84 &amp; pp. 408-409.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the medieval practice, more relics (also, different ones) are shown nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;De la Haye (1990), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relics display in the Basilica of Our Lady ====

The relics display in the Basilica of Our Lady starts with a liturgical entrance procession in which the main relics from the treasury are brought into the church. While groups of carriers walk up the central aisle toward the choir stairs, the ''[[Litany of the Saints]]'' is sung. The carriers position themselves in a semicircle in the [[chancel]] area in front of the [[ambulatory]]. The service starts with a reading from the [[Gospel]], after which the priest announces the relics with the medieval formula "Thou shall be shown..." The relics are shown in five groups. Each time a group has been announced the carriers step forward near the edge of the choir steps, then lifting up the reliquaries for a few seconds, so they can be seen by all. At no point are the relics taken out of their containers. A prayer is said and the carriers return to their position in the semicircle, after which the next group of relics is announced. In 2018 the order of showing was:
# relics of [[Christian martyrs]]: the reliquary of the apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]], the reliquary bust of the apostle [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]], a Scandinavian reliquary horn with relics of the apostles [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]] and [[Jude the Apostle|Judas Thaddeus]], and the reliquary arm of Saint Tranquillus (a saint associated with the [[Theban Legion]]);
# relics of the [[List of bishops and prince-bishops of Liège|holy bishops of Maastricht]]: the reliquary busts of [[Servatius of Tongeren|Servatius]], [[Monulph]], [[Gondulph of Maastricht|Gondulph]] and [[Hubertus|Hubert]];
# relics of holy women: the reliquary of the girdle of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]], Mary's wedding ring, relics of [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[Bernadette Soubirous]];
# relics of holy men: a reliquary with oil from the grave of [[Saint Nicholas]], a relic of [[Saint Roch]] and a relic of [[Saint Giles]];
# relics of [[Jesus]]: a ''staurothèque'' (cross reliquary) with relics of the [[True Cross]] (a papal present in gratitude of the donation of the Byzantine double cross).
After the blessing, given with the cross reliquary, a procession is formed once more, taking the relics to the north transept where they are exhibited for about an hour. Members of the congregation can then approach the relics, touch them, take photographs and venerate them.&lt;ref name=toningolv&gt;'Reliekentoning Heiligdomsvaart 2018 Basiliek van Sterre der Zee', booklet handed out at the relics display in the Basilica of Our Lady, 2 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relics display in the Basilica of St Servatius ====
[[File:20180602 Maastricht Heiligdomsvaart, reliekentoning St-Servaasbasiliek 61.jpg|thumb|Adoration of relics in the Chapel of Saint Joseph (after the displaying ceremony)]]
More or less the same procedure is followed in the Basilica of St Servatius, with some differences. The formula "''Thou shall be shown...''" is sung here by a [[Cantor (Christianity)|cantor]]. Each time a group of relics is shown, a short [[fanfare]] sounds from the west choir of the church, adding to the dramatic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Nicolaas Matsier}}: [https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1997/06/20/relieken-en-de-heiligdomsvaart-in-maastricht-een-hot-10448373-a998719 'Relieken en de Heiligdomsvaart in Maastricht; Een hot line met gene zijde']. In: ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 20 juni 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, after having been shown, the relics do not return to the chancel area, but are immediately taken down the choir steps into the side chapels. Here they remain, guarded by members of confraternities. This means that, unlike at Our Lady's, the chancel is virtually empty at the end of the service. It is remarkable that the arm reliquary of Saint Thomas and most of the Servatiana (see below: 'List of devotional objects/Servatiana'), which were so pivotal in the medieval relics display, are no longer shown. The current order of showing is:
# relics of Jesus: the patriarchal cross of 1490 with relics of the True Cross;
# relics of holy men:&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In 1955 this group of relics was subdivided into: apostles, martyrs and confessors. See: {{aut|R. de la Haye}}, 'Geschiedenis van de Maastrichtse Heiligdomsvaart'. In: Van Rensch/Koldeweij/De la Haye/De Kreek (1990), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; reliquaries of [[Marcellinus and Peter]], [[Saint Blaise]], [[Livinus|Saint Livinus]], [[Amor of Aquitane|Saint Amor]] and [[Saint Gerlach]];
# relics of holy women: reliquaries of [[Agnes of Rome|Saint Agnes]], [[Saint Barbara]], [[Saint Cecilia]], [[Amelberga of Susteren|Saint Amelberga]] and the blessed [[Clara Fey]];
# relics of holy bishops of Maastricht: the reliquary busts of Monulph, Gondulph and [[Lambert of Maastricht|Lambert]], and the reliquary horn of Hubert;
# relics of Saint Servatius: the key of Saint Servatius, his pectoral cross, the reliquary bust and the reliquary chest (which remains immobile).
After the conclusion of the ceremony the relics are exhibited in the side aisles and chapels, in order to be admired and venerated. Members of various confraternities and guilds keep watch over them.&lt;ref&gt;'Heiligdomsvaart 1990'. In: ''De Sint Servaas'', pp. 408-409.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Processions ===
The two outdoor processions – not to be confounded with the liturgical processions inside the churches – are perhaps the most iconic aspect of the Maastricht pilgrimage. The colourful parades on both Sundays are watched by ten thousands of people, as well as being televised. Additionally, there are a number of smaller processions, such as the opening procession, the 'Star Procession' (departing from various parish churches), and the children's procession (with self-made reliquary shrines).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl/nl/impressies-hdv-2018/hdv-2018-processie-en-openingsmis-24-mei-2018 'Processie en Openingsmis 24.05.2018'], [http://www.heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl/nl/impressies-hdv-2018/hdv-2018-sterprocessie-25-mei-2018 'Sterprocessie 25.05.2018'] and [http://www.heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl/nl/impressies-hdv-2018/hdv-2018-mini-heiligdomsvaart-28-mei-2018 'Mini Heiligdomsvaart 28.05.2018'] on website ''heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:20180527 Maastricht Heiligdomsvaart 230 (cropped).jpg|thumb|260px|Spectator stand and TV filming at [[Vrijthof (Maastricht)|Vrijthof]] during the first procession, 27 May 2018]]
The route of the main procession on the first Sunday starts in [[Wyck (Maastricht)|Wyck]] and passes over the [[Sint Servaasbrug|Saint Servatius Bridge]]. A week later the starting point is in [[Jekerkwartier]] from where it goes to [[Onze Lieve Vrouweplein]] and along the [[Meuse]]. Both routes continue via Markt towards [[Vrijthof]]. Here, in the Basilica of St Servatius, a short service is held, ending with the singing of the ''Hymn of Saint Servatius''.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;First mentioned in 1923 as being part of the pilgrimage. [https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010530712:mpeg21:pdf 'Kerknieuws. De zevenjaarlijksche Heiligdomsvaart te Maastricht'] in ''[[De Tijd (Netherlands)|De Tijd]]'', 23 July 1923 (on website ''resolver.kb.nl'').&lt;/ref&gt; In Vrijthof, and sometimes in Markt or Sint Pieterstraat, the procession can be watched from a [[Bleacher|spectator stand]]. The first rows at the Vrijthof stand are usually reserved for guests such as bishops, cabinet ministers, the [[List of King's and Queen's Commissioners of Limburg|governor of Limburg]], the [[List of mayors of Maastricht|mayor of Maastricht]] and other dignitaries. Television recordings usually take place at Vrijthof.&lt;ref name=ommegangen&gt;[http://www.heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl/application/files/4115/2699/1969/Flyer_Ommegang_27_mei.pdf 'Flyer procession 27 May 2018'], [http://www.heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl/application/files/2515/2699/2184/Flyer_Ommegang_3_juni.pdf 'flyer procession 3 June 2018'] and photos of previous processions on website ''heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, the organizers of the processions have found it increasingly difficult to involve local participants, especially children and young adults. As a result, traditional groups of [[altar server]]s, [[choir boy]]s, [[scouting]] groups and 'brides' (young women dressed in white) have largely disappeared. The same has happened to Catholic women's associations and workers' associations. Their place has now been taken by non-religious, historical and folkloristic groups, or in some cases by religious groups from elsewhere (e.g. the Singing Virgins of [[Tongeren]]).&lt;ref name=ommegangen/&gt;

==== Carrier groups ====
About half of the participants in the processions are members of [[confraternity| confraternities]], carriers guilds or other groups that are involved in carrying and escorting the holy objects assigned to them. The Confraternity of Saint Servatius for instance is responsible for the safety of the reliquary chest of Saint Servatius (or ''Noodkist''), while the Saint Servatius Guild is concerned with the bust of Saint Servatius. Other groups take care of the bust of Saint Lambert, the busts of Saint Monulph and Saint Gondulph, the statue of Our Lady, Star of the Sea, or other statues. The larger objects are carried on a processional [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] (comparable to a ''[[paso]]'' in Spanish processions but usually smaller), decorated with flowers. The carriers are dressed formally (in [[morning dress]] or [[white tie]]) or wear pseudo-liturgical [[tunic]]s. In order to move the larger litters usually two teams of 12 or 16 carriers are needed. Other members carry processional lanterns or poles decorated with confraternity medals. Smaller objects are carried by single participants, previously often by priests or nuns, nowadays mostly by seminarists or other laymen. They usually wear white gloves and/or hold the objects with the wide sleeves of their gowns.&lt;ref name=ommegangen/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Theme groups ====
Since the 1960s or 70s a theme is chosen for each edition of the pilgrimage. In the processions, the theme provides a guideline for those groups that attempt to present the Gospel to an increasingly non-religious audience. In 2018 the theme ''Do good and do not look back'' was presented by several local amateur theatre groups. Some participants [[Historical reenactment|reenacted]] themes from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]], others focussed on Catholic themes like Saint Servatius, [[Pope Francis]] and the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Holy Sacraments]]. A group of students from the [[List of Catholic seminaries|Roman Catholic seminaries]] of [[Rolduc]] and Liège carried reproductions of a painting by the [[Master of Alkmaar]], illustrating the [[Works of mercy|Seven Works of Mercy]]. As an answer to this, members of the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]] carried drawings by school children with the same theme in a contemporary context.&lt;ref name=ommegangen/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Representational groups ====
As there have been less participants from local churches in recent years, there is more room for other groups, from other denominations, from other cultural backgrounds or from other towns. In 2018 there were local representatives of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (see above), the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Philippines|Philippine]] community (with an ''[[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]]'' theme), the [[Netherlands Antilles|Antillian]] community (with a [[gospel]] group), the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]], the [[Order of Saint Lazarus]], the [[Knights Templar|OSMTH Order of the Knights Templar]], the Bund der St. Sebastianus Schützenjugend (with the ''Aachener Friedenskreuz'' or Aachen Peace Cross) and the [[Sisters of the Poor Child Jesus]] (with a banner commemorating the [[beatification]] of their founder, [[Clara Fey]]).&lt;ref name=ommegangen/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Music and folklore groups ====
[[Church choir]]s, [[marching band]]s, [[fanfare orchestra]]s, [[Corps of drums|drum bands]], guilds of [[Flag throwing|flag throwers]] and folkloristic [[militia]]s (Dutch: ''schutterijen'') have been part of religious processions in this part of Europe for a long time. In the ''Heiligdomsvaart'' processions the Basilica Choir (the main choir of Our Lady's) accompanies the statue of the Star of the Sea, while the Cappella Sancti Servatii (the choir of St Servatius') walks in front of the bust of Saint Servatius. A position of honour is given to the marching band that walks behind the ''Noodkist'', thus closing the procession. On the first Sunday in 2018 this was the [[Royal Harmonie Sainte Cécile Eijsden|Royal Harmonie Sainte Cécile]] of [[Eijsden]]; on the second Sunday it was the Harmonie Sint Petrus en Paulus from the Maastricht neighbourhood of Wolder.&lt;ref name=ommegangen/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Cultural programme ===
Readings, concerts, theatre performances, film screenings and exhibitions take place at various locations around the city throughout the pilgrimage. Most of these activities are connected to the over-all theme. In 2018 there were plays and concerts in various churches: Saint John's, [[Sint-Lambertuskerk (Maastricht)|Saint Lambert's]], Saint Theresia's, the Sacred Heart Church (Church of the Dome) as well as the cloisters of St Servatius'. Films were shown in the open air in front of the church of St. Peter-Beneden. Theme exhibitions took place in the cloisters of the basilicas, the east crypt of Our Lady, the Dominican Church, the Centre Céramique cultural centre, the Vrijthof Theatre and the [[Bonnefantenmuseum]]. The exhibition ''[[Cope]]s'' in the Bonnefantenmuseum showed historical copes, as well as contemporary designs by local designers of Fashionclash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl/application/files/1515/0417/3959/Brochure_HDV_Cultuur_www.pdf 'Brochure Cultuurprogramma'] on website ''heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of devotional objects in the pilgrimage ==
[[File:2018 Schatkamer St-Servaasbasiliek, entree.jpg|thumb|Half-empty showcases in the [[Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius|Treasury of the Basilica of St Servatius]] during the 2018 pilgrimage]]
In the septennial pilgrimages a range of [[Catholic devotions|devotional objects]] take centre stage, foremost the [[relic]]s of Saint Servatius. Some objects are very old and are part of the local or [[national patrimony]]. Not every [[relic]], [[reliquary]] or [[statue]] of a [[Christian saint|saint]] is shown during the ''Heiligdomsvaart'' pilgrimage. There are hundreds of objects in the treasuries of the main churches, which requires selection. For conservational reasons some fragile objects that traditionally have been part of the pilgrimage are no longer shown.

=== Servatiana ===
Since the earliest records the so-called '[[Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius#Servatiana|Servatiana]]' have played a pivotal role in the Maastricht pilgrimage. These are objects believed to be the personal belongings of Saint Servatius. In the septennial pilgrimage they were shown from the dwarf gallery. Some of the Servatiana were lost over time. Remaining in the treasury are: the key of Saint Servatius, the [[pectoral cross]] of Saint Servatius, his [[Seal (emblem)|seal]], his cup, his [[pilgrim's staff]], his [[crozier]], his [[chalice]], his [[paten]] and his portable altar. Due to their size and frailty their role has diminished in recent years. An additional reason for this could be that art historians have argued that, with the exception of the cup of Saint Servatius, none of these objects are old enough to have been the personal belongings of someone who lived in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Koldeweij (1985), pp. 55-56, 283-286.&lt;/ref&gt; These days only the key and the pectoral cross are shown during the relics display in the church; none of the Servatiana are included in the processions.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl/nl/impressies-oudere-jaren/hdv-2011-02072011 Photos of the relics display in St Servatius', 02.07.2011]' on website ''heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the pilgrim's staff is on permanent display in the small crypt which gives access to the grave of Saint Servatius.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Maastricht Devotions ===
The four major devotional statues in Maastricht, locally known at the City or Municipal Devotions (Dutch: ''stadsdevoties''), are religious objects that have been venerated in Maastricht for a long time. They are: the statue of Our Lady, Star of the Sea, the Black Christ of Wyck, the bust of Saint Servatius and the bust of Saint Lambert. During the Maastricht pilgrimage they take part in processions and various other religious activities.&lt;ref name=programma/&gt;

==== Star of the Sea ====
The statue of [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] (usually referred to as: the Star of the Sea) is probably the best known and most popular of the Maastricht devotions. It is a 15th-century statue of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] with the baby child [[Jesus]] in the style of the German ''schöne Madonnen''. It has a long tradition of being included in processions, first with the Maastricht [[Minorites]], after 1837 with the parish of [[Basilica of Our Lady, Maastricht|Our Lady]]. Even now it participates in around ten processions each year. For the shorter processions a small processional [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] is used that requires four carriers. For the longer processions, as in the septennial pilgrimage, a much larger steel structure is used. Twelve carriers are required to take this litter on their shoulders. The larger structure is covered in white [[damask]] and decorated with flowers. The carriers are members of the Carriers Guild of the Star of the Sea (Dutch: ''Dragersgilde Sterre der Zee''). The guild members wear [[tunic]]s, some dark-blue and red, others light-blue and white, decorated with guild medals. They all wear white gloves. At regular intervals one team of carriers replaces the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sterre-der-zee.nl/dragersgilde/ 'Dragersgilde Sterre der Zee'] on website ''sterre-der-zee.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Confraternity]] of the Star of the Sea (Dutch: ''Broederschap Sterre der Zee'') escort the processional litter, wearing [[white tie]] and a black [[cloak]] with a six-pointed star on it. Some carry processional lanterns or processional poles with fraternity plaques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sterre-der-zee.nl/broederschap-sterre-der-zee/ 'Broederschap Sterre der Zee'] on website ''sterre-der-zee.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue of the Star of the Sea has no role in the relics display in the church, although this ceremony is traditionally concluded by the hymn ''O Star of the Sea''.&lt;ref name=toningolv/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Black Christ of Wyck ====
The 'Black Christ of Wyck' is a large 13th-century corpus of dark [[walnut]] that was once part of a [[crucifix]]. For centuries it was kept in the monastery of the [[Order of St Mary Magdalene|White Nuns]] (Dutch: ''Wittevrouwenklooster'') in [[Vrijthof]], where it attracted pilgrims mainly from Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ubachs/Evers (2005), p. 600: 'Zwarte Christus'.&lt;/ref&gt; After the dissolution of the monasteries the statue was given to the parish church of St Martin in [[Wyck (Maastricht)|Wyck]]. In 1813 the Confraternity of the Holy Cross (Dutch: ''Broederschap van het Heilig Kruis'') was founded, which in 1963 had around 2,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Ubachs/Evers (2005), p. 98: 'Broederschap van het H. Kruis'.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the confraternity carry the Black Christ in processions on a large processional litter similar to the one used for the Star of the Sea. Their tunics are red and black, matching their processional banner.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Bust of Saint Servatius ====
[[File:20180527 Maastricht Heiligdomsvaart 008.jpg|thumb|Banners showing the bust of Saint Servatius]]
The reliquary bust of [[Saint Servatius]] as we know it presumably is the second or third bust of Maastricht's patron saint. A previous bust dating back to around 1400 was shown from the dwarf gallery to pilgrims in Vrijthof square. It was largely destroyed during the [[Siege of Maastricht (1579)|Siege of 1579]]. The new bust was commissioned by the besieger, [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]], whose coat of arms is on the pedestal. The silver-coated and partly gilded bust is a major artistic work in the Treasury of Saint Servatius. It contains a large fragment of the skull of the saint.&lt;ref name=delahaye116/&gt; The bust is also a [[cultural icon]] of the Maastricht pilgrimage. Images of the bust appear on flags, banners and printed material. The bust takes central stage at the opening ceremony of the pilgrimage (see: 'Programme/Masses and other services'). Until the 1970s, the brothers of the Beyart Monastery (Brothers of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, or Brothers of Maastricht) carried the bust in processions; since 1976 members of the Saint Servatius Guild have taken that task (literally) upon their shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sintservaas.nl/Gemeenschap/sint-servaasgilde 'Sint Servaasgilde'] on website ''sintservaas.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the guild wear two-part dark blue tunics, white gloves and a green ribbon around their neck with a guild medal. As is the case with the Star of the Sea statue, two processional litters are used, one for short or indoor processions, the other one for longer trips. A plastic slip-over is used to protect the bust in bad weather.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Bust of Saint Lambert ====
The reliquary bust of [[Lambert of Maastricht|Saint Lambert]] is relative young in comparison to the afore-mentioned objects. It was made by the [[Utrecht]] [[silversmith]]s Edelsmidse Brom for the [[Sint-Lambertuskerk (Maastricht)|parish church of St Lambert]] in 1938-40. This happened after an ambitious parish priest obtained a relic of Saint Lambert, Maastricht's last bishop and the only one who was born there. The relic was picked up in Liège and brought back in triumph by 2,000 parishioners in two extra trains in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Ubachs/Evers (2005), p. 300: 'Lambertus, h'.&lt;/ref&gt; The new bust was clearly modelled after the bust of Saint Servatius. It instantly gained popularity, to such a degree that it was included in the Maastricht Devotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|J. van Term en J. Nelissen}} (1979): ''Kerken van Maastricht'', p. 94. Vroom &amp; Dreesmann, Maastricht&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Lambert's church closed in 1985 due to constructional problems and the parish merged with that of Saint Anne. Since 2004 the bust is kept in the modern church of Saint Anne, where in 2018 it was given a separate chapel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annalambertus.nl/Rondleiding.html 'Rondleiding'] on website ''annalambertus.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt; The bust of Saint Lambert is carried in processions on either one of two processional litters, depending on the occasion, much like the previously-mentioned objects. The small litter is dressed in green; the larger litter in white damask and decorated with flowers. Members of the Carriers Guild of Saint Lambert (Dutch: ''Dragersgilde St. Lambertus'') wear green and yellow tunics; around their neck a chain with an embroidered medallion with an image of the bust and the [[Coat of arms of Maastricht|five-pointed star of Maastricht]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annalambertus.nl/Groeperingen.html 'Groeperingen'] on website ''annalambertus.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reliquaries and statues ===
Despite the fact that the emphasis in modern pilgrimages has somewhat shifted away from saints and relics worship, the historical and religious significance of the objects concerned makes their presence paramount. Showing the reliquaries remains a central feature of the Maastricht pilgrimage. Apart from the main reliquary of Saint Servatius (the ''Noodkist''), these include a number of reliquary busts of apostles and bishops, as well as reliquaries and statues of other locally venerated saints. As mentioned before, many reliquaries are considered too fragile to leave their protected environment. This applies to most of the Servatiana, the [[alb]] of Saint Servatius, the cloak of Saint Lambert, several ''staurothèques'' (cross reliquaries), all the reliquary horns in the treasuries (except for the Viking horn in Our Lady's), all the ivory and enamelled caskets, as well as the silver reliquary arm of Saint Thomas.

==== Reliquary chest of Saint Servatius ====
[[File:20180602 Maastricht Heiligdomsvaart, reliekentoning St-Servaasbasiliek 64.jpg|thumb|The ''Noodkist'', firmly positioned on the choir steps for the duration of the pilgrimage, guarded by members of the Confraternity of Saint Servatius]]
The reliquary chest of Saint Servatius, often – incorrectly – referred to as the [[Shrine]] of Saint Servatius,&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The use of the word 'shrine' is an incorrect translation of the German and Dutch term [[:de:Schrein|Schrein]]' or '[[:nl:Schrijn|schrijn]]', meaning simply 'box' or 'chest'. In German it has come to mean 'reliquary chest'.&lt;/ref&gt;, in Dutch usually referred to as the ''Noodkist'' ('Chest of Distress'), is a 12th-century chest that contains the bodily remains of bishop [[Servatius of Tongeren|Servatius]] of Maastricht-[[Tongeren]]. The wooden chest with elaborate [[Gilding|gilded]] copper reliefs, [[champlevé]] enamels and [[Gemstone|precious stones]] is the main treasure of the Basilica of St Servatius and arguably the most important medieval object in the Netherlands. Its significance as a major product of [[Mosan art|Mosan]] [[metalwork]] has been recognised internationally.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The ''Noodkist'' was one of the few objects from Dutch collections that was included in the grand exhibition ''Rhine and Meuse. Art and Culture 800-1400'', held in [[Brussels]] and [[Cologne]] in 1972. {{aut|H. Schnitzler, J. Lejeune, and others (eds.)}} (1972): ''Rijn en Maas. Kunst en Cultuur 800-1400'' (exhibition catalogue), pp. 245-246. [[Schnütgen Museum]] &amp; Belgian Ministries of Dutch and French Culture, Cologne/Brussels.&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries the ''Noodkist'' was the centre of veneration of Saint Servatius in Maastricht, receiving its nickname from the custom of taking it out in procession in times of distress (first mentioned in 1409).&lt;ref&gt;Ahsmann (2017), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Not much is known about its role in the medieval pilgrimage practices. For obvious reasons it could not be shown from the dwarf gallery. Normally it stood on a stone altar behind the [[Altar in the Catholic Church|high altar]], covered by a ''capsa'', a painted wooden box. During the pilgrimage the capsa was removed and pilgrims were given access to the [[chancel]]. They were even allowed to touch the chest.&lt;ref&gt;Kroos (1985), p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the revival of the pilgrimage in the 19th century, the chest has been part of most festivities. Nowadays, it is permanently exhibited on the choir stairs (which in fact are situated in the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]]). When the church is open to the public, the chest is permanently guarded by two or four members of the Confraternity of Saint Servatius. This association was founded in 1916 and currently has around 50 members. Inside the church they wear tunics, either yellow and red, or black and red. The fraternity members also escort the chest when it leaves the church in processions, which normally only happens once a year (Saint Servatius Day, 13 May). The brotherhood then wears [[morning dress]] with red and white [[Rosette (politics)|rosettes]] and fraternity medals. The processional litter is custom-designed featuring a steel structure with flexible parts that can be adjusted on the shoulders of the carriers. There are normally two teams of sixteen fraternity brothers involved in carrying the chest. The lower part of the frame is covered with grey fabric. A [[perspex]] box in the shape of the ''Noodkist'' covers it, regardless of the weather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broederschapsintservaas.nl Website Confraternity of Saint Servatius].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reliquary busts ====
Amongst the many reliquaries and devotional objects in Maastricht are a dozen reliquary busts. The busts discussed here predominantly date from the 19th century, made of wood and then [[polychrome]]d. They replace the silver or gilded busts that were lost in the French Period. There are a few remarkable 'doubles'. Both the Basilica of Our Lady and the Basilica of St Servatius own busts of Monulph and Gondulph, the 6th-century bishops of Maastricht often associated with one another. All four busts are shown during the relics display in the churches but only one set joins the outdoor processions (the set owned by St Servatius'). They are carried on relatively small litters by members of the Guild of Saint Monulph and Saint Gondulph, which also is a [[bell-ringer]]s guild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sintservaas.nl/htm/7e.htm 'Klokkenluidersgilde'] on website ''sintservaas.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, both churches own a bust of Saint Servatius. The one in Our Lady's is merely used for the relics display in the church. The same goes for Saint Batholomew's and Saint Hubert's busts, also in Our Lady's. St Servatius' Basilica has two busts of Saint Lambert (one silver bust is on loan from the [[Rijksmuseum]] and never leaves the treasury), which in fact makes three, together with the bust in St Anne's. St Servatius' also owns a bust of [[Amandus|Saint Amandus]], another bishop of Maastricht. Regular 'visiting' busts from other churches and other towns are the bust of [[Saint Anthony of Padua]] (from the Maastricht parish of Scharn), the bust of [[Amelberga of Susteren|Saint Amelberga]] (from [[Susteren Abbey]]), the silver bust of [[Saint Gerlach]] (from the parish of [[Houthem, Netherlands|Houthem-Sint Gerlach]]).&lt;ref name=ommegangen/&gt;

Note: the gilded and silver-coated busts of Saint Servatius and Saint Lambert are discussed in detail above (see: 'Maastricht Devotions').

==== Other reliquaries ====

A few reliquaries do not fit into the categories above but are nevertheless important enough to be included in the pilgrimage. A distinguished piece – even though it is a 15th-century copy of a much older cross – is the Patriarchal Cross of the Basilica of St Servatius. It contains several large pieces of the [[True Cross]]. It is carried by a priest as a [[processional cross]] at the entrance procession during the ceremony of the relics display. It is however too fragile to participate in any other processions. That would perhaps also apply to the reliquary with the girdle of Saint Mary in Our Lady's Basilica, were it not that this relic is considered too vital to be excluded. The core of the reliquary is medieval (first mentioned in 1286) but the outer case was replaced in the 19th century. Both inside the church and in the outdoor processions it is carried and escorted by a group of women in light-blue dresses. Two women carry the processional litter; the others hold red roses.

Since the Second World War, a number of important relics have 'visited' Maastricht (see: 'History/20th century'). In 2018 there were busts from Houthem and Susteren (mentioned above), a cross reliquary from [[Dordrecht]], a reliquary of [[Lidwina|Saint Lidwina]] from [[Schiedam]], and a reliquary of Saint Cassius and Florentius (martyrs of the [[Theban Legion]]) from [[Bonn]].&lt;ref name=ommegangen/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Other statues ====
Besides the four main devotional statues (see: 'Maastricht Devotions'), there are a few other statues of saints that are included in the Maastricht pilgrimage. Some Maastricht parishes are represented in the pilgrimage processions with their [[patron saint]], each with their own carriers guild. A 15th-century statue of Saint Peter hails from the parish of [[Sint Pieter]] (in fact two parishes: one at the bottom of [[Sint-Pietersberg]], the other one halfway up the hill). The parish of [[Saint Anthony of Padua]] in Scharn is represented both with a bust (mentioned above) and a 17th-century(?) statue of the saint. Nearby [[Amby]] participates with a statue of [[Saint Walpurga]]. A special guest in 2018 was the statue of [[Titles of Mary|Our Lady, Cause of Our Joy]], from the Basilica of Our Lady in [[Tongeren]].&lt;ref name=ommegangen/&gt;

'''''Plane Daffy''''' is a 1944 [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon directed by [[Frank Tashlin]], starring [[Daffy Duck]]. It's a [[World War II]] propaganda short that depicts Daffy as a messenger battling a female Nazi spy and eventually being confronted with [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Hermann Göring]].

==Synopsis==
One after another of a company of [[carrier pigeon]]s fall prey to the seductive wiles of "Queen of the Spies": Hatta Mari. The alarm is raised at pigeon headquarters when Pigeon 13 (a [[Mortimer Snerd]]-esque yokel similar to [[Beaky Buzzard]]) goes [[AWOL]] with the female [[Nazi]] spy bird. He reveals all his secrets (after she slipped him a [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|mickey]]). In shame, Pigeon 13 departs to commit suicide, although after an off-screen gunshot is heard, he briefly returns to note "I ''missed''."

Later, self-described woman-hater Daffy Duck volunteers for the next mission. Hatta tries to seduce him by hiking up her skirt to reveal her shapely leg and kissing him full on the lips twice. The first kiss electrocutes Daffy and melts him like butter, but the second kiss electrocutes Hatta Mari having the same effect on her. Daffy ultimately resists her charms, but swallows his secret message when the temptress corners him. After a frenetic battle, she [[x-ray]]s Daffy and broadcasts the supposed secret ("Hitler is a stinker") to Hitler himself. Outraged, Hitler declares "Dat ist no military secret!" Goebbels and Göring concur -- "Ja. Everybody knows ''dat''!"—then shoot themselves in the heads after receiving Hitler’s angry glare. Daffy Duck then concludes the cartoon by saying "They lose more darn ‘Nutzis’ that way," and then going into one of his famous bouncing fits whooping.

Police are often a significant source of abuse for sex workers, particularly poor sex workers. Greater exposure to the police often means more experience of police abuse; one study found that sex workers with greater police oversight were more likely to be obliged to provide free sexual services to the police than sex workers with less police oversight.&lt;ref name="levittChicago"/&gt; For some groups of sex workers in some locations in the U.S., police are the primary source of violence.&lt;ref name="torrezChicago"/&gt; Police may be the most abusive towards sex workers who have experienced the most victimization from other sources; a study found that sex workers who had been manipulated, coerced, or forced into sex work were more likely to suffer police abuse than sex workers who chose to enter sex work.&lt;ref name="burnsAlaska"/&gt; 

Police abuse can have long lasting consequences; when police falsely arrest someone for prostitution, the resulting criminal record may make it difficult for that person to find jobs or get housing. Incarceration and court attendance for false charges can disrupt efforts to pursue careers outside of sex work, as when a student misses classes.&lt;ref name="viceNYC"/&gt; Seemingly innocuous actions can affect safety; when officers tell sex workers to "move along", the workers often end up in areas where they feel less safe.&lt;ref name="arringtonDC"/&gt; When police target an HIV+ person for repeated arrests, they may prevent the person from going to scheduled appointments with health care providers, and jail disrupts medication routines.&lt;ref name="hrwNewOrleans"/&gt; And sometimes abuse creates physical harm that is immediate and intentional, as when police officers physically assault a sex worker without evidence of crime and without making an arrest.&lt;ref name="thukral0NYC"/&gt;

This article lists government investigations, research reports, and news articles that describe police abuse of sex workers in the United States, and gives a description of the relevant information from each document.

Excerpt from a sex worker story:

{{ quote
| text= One of [the police officers] put his hand up my skirt and ripped my underwear off. He slammed me down on the car, he injured me. Um, left me with some broken fingertips, broken toes, fractured cheekbone... I was bleeding, I had my skirt ripped... people were just mortified because they'd seen a teenage girl get assaulted by a police officer...
| author= study respondent
}}

The general trend of the study statistics was that the sex workers who had suffered the worst victimization in the past were the ones most likely to be abused by the police.

The following tables compare the experiences of three groups: all the respondents in the study, the respondents where were manipulated or coerced into sex work, and the respondents who were forced into sex work.

Respondents who were manipulated or coerced into sex work were more likely to attempt to report a crime, but the police were less likely to take their report and more likely to threaten or arrest them.

The DOJ found "indications that the BCPD disregards reports of sexual assault by people involved in the sex trade..." Investigators heard from the community that officers were coercing sexual favors from sex workers. Internal records indicated that this was true and the officers weren't being punished. Prior to the DOJ investigation, an internal investigation by the BCPD found an officer receiving sex from a sex worker in exchange for money and immunity from arrest. The case was closed without any attempt to gather more evidence, interview the police officer, or prosecute the officer. Cases were opened for the same officer a second and third time for the same offense. The witness for the third case died before she could be interviewed, and only then did the BCPD review the officer's phone records and discover that he had sent sexually explicit messages to a number of female sex workers. The officer was allowed to retire. The DOJ found similar cases involving other officers.

The primary form of police abuse was coercive sex, through the threat of arrest. In some cases the officer received the sexual service and arrested the sex worker anyway.

This is a working paper that was never published, as far as I know. However, the PDF file is freely available and some of the results are discussed in Levitt and Dubner's book ''SuperFreakonomics''. 

The study compared two neighborhoods, one where none of the women had pimps, and one where all the women had pimps. The women without pimps were more likely to be arrested and three percent of all sexual services were provided to police officers free of charge. The women with pimps were less likely to be arrested and didn't provide free sexual services. Sex workers were more likely to have sex with a police officer than be arrested by one.

Twenty four percent of street-based sex workers had been raped by a police officer. Twenty percent had experienced other sexual assault from police officers. Women doing survival sex and women in drug houses experienced a lot of violence from police. Thirty percent of exotic dancers who had been raped were raped by police, and twenty percent of the sexual violence they experienced was committed by police. Twenty five percent of escorts had been robbed by a police officer. Eighteen percent of escorts had been forced to masturbate a police officer.

2012

This is a survey of bad encounters experienced by young people in the sex trade and street economy. Bad encounters were divided into three categories: violence, harassment, and refusal to help. The largest source of both harassment and violence was the category of police, which included the Chicago Police Department, the FBI, and security guards in schools. Sexual violence by police made up 11% of all bad encounters.

One of the main findings was that institutional violence made individual violence worse. When girls suffered harm and sought help, the system they were seeking help from often did more harm. An example was a girl being arrested when she tried to file a report for rape. Or this:

{{ quote
| text= I went to the hospital for a rape kit and when I got there the police officer accused me and my advocate of not cooperating. The officer started yelling at us both and said I was going to jail for lying. The officer never filed a report but called Child Services and I got sent to a group home but nothing ever happened with the rape.
}}

Another finding was that bad encounters increase when institutions work together. In over 40% of bad encounters with police, another institution was involved. Young people run away from hospitals, foster care, and other service systems because they are physically, emotionally, or sexually harmed or neglected. When police forcibly return someone to one of these settings, they place the young person back in the harmful situation they were escaping from.

An example of police working with another institution to scare a person away from getting help:

{{ quote
| text= I got hit on the head by someone on the train. The police took me to the hospital. The hospital tried to put me in the psych ward because I was transgender. They said I couldn't leave the hospital even though I didn't want to stay. They called the policeman back to try to force me to stay because they said I was a minor. I went to the bathroom then hid and left before they got there.
}}

The result was that the person never got the medical help they needed because of gender discrimination and fear of being put in a psych ward.

The researchers found that police frequently sexually assaulted youth in the sex trade. The following story, sex followed by arrest, was repeated many times:

{{ quote
| text= I was solicited by a police officer who said that if I had sex with him he wouldn't arrest me. So I did. Then afterwards he cuffed me and pressed charges anyway.
}}

Sometimes it was worse.

{{ quote
| text= I was going to meet a new john, it turned out to be a sting set up by the cops. He got violent with me, handcuffed me and then raped me. He cleaned me up for the police station and I got sentenced to four months in jail for prostitution.
}}

Young trans women profiled as prostitutes was another common story.

{{ quote
| text= I keep being arrested in Rogers Park just for standing still. They keep taking me in for prostitution even though I'm not doing anything at all. It's the same white cop doing it too.
}}

From the point of view of the young people in the study, the transition to an anti-trafficking regime hasn't made much difference.

{{ quote
| text= When being held in protective custody [because they said I was a victim of human trafficking] they started withholding my sheets, then towels, then pillows, then food because they said I wasn't telling them everything I could&amp;mdash;when in fact I was.
}}

And this:

{{ quote
| text= I was receiving a rape kit after a trafficking experience and the detective was questioning me and my advocate. The officer physically wouldn't let me out of the room. She threatened to send me and my advocate to jail unless we reported what happened [but I didn't want to tell her about my experience.] The officer got loud and in our faces, swore at us and made a big scene. I got between the officer and my advocate to get her out of my advocate's face. As soon as I could I ran out the door but the officer grabbed my arm so I pushed away and hid until I could get out of the hospital.

One respondent was given the choice between arrest and doing something "disgusting". She wouldn't tell the researcher what she was asked to do, but she told the other police officers at the station about it and they laughed at her.

A respondent was asked by an officer to show her breasts in order to avoid arrest. Another respondent had charges dropped because of police misconduct; the officer who arrested her had her perform oral sex on him.

Survey respondents said that police profiled transgender people as sex workers and subjected them to verbal abuse and sexual misconduct, including demands for sex in exchange for leniency. Police were arresting people for solicitation if they carried condoms. Even trans sex workers who weren't arrested for carrying condoms saw it happen to others and where afraid to carry condoms. Some police officers used possession of condoms to coerce trans sex workers into providing free sexual services. 

People who tested positive for HIV while in jail were visited by an HIV task force that scheduled appointments at a clinic. However, many people were rearrested before their scheduled appointment. One woman was arrested ten times in three years, preventing her from going to any scheduled appointments to receive care for her HIV infection during that period. Jail interrupts taking medication on a regular basis.

Transgender youth reported being picked up for prostitution or loitering for prostitution when they weren't working. One eighteen year old transgender youth reported being extorted for sex by police officers eight times. Once arrested, transgender youth were more likely to be sexually exploited by jail staff than cisgender youth were. 

Two quotes from cisgender respondents:

Abuse varied by location and police officer. Women were more likely to be arrested or ticketed in Brooklyn. Interactions with police in the Bronx were more likely to involve off-duty officers. However, a white woman in the Bronx reported that the police targeted her because she was white, telling her that she was making white people look bad. In Bushwick police harassment was so bad that a service organization was forced to change its location to protect its outreach staff. Latinas reported the worst harassment, including name-calling, stalking, and throwing food. A couple of women based in Bushwick reported daily harassment that caused them to avoid leaving their homes.

Examples of police language: 

{{ quote
| text= bitch

ho

slut

you're not dead yet?

we gotta go clean up the trash

why should we help you?
}}

A transwoman said she was subjected to constant harassment, and the officers who harassed her were the ones who wanted "oral sex on the side."

Thirty percent of the respondents reported threats of violence from the police, and twenty seven percent reported experiencing violence. One respondent said "I've seen cops get out of a car and beat a girl, and then get back in the car and leave." Another said that her greatest fear during arrest was "not coming home at all." The white woman from the Bronx said "... they throw you on the floor and they step on you..."

Another respondent reported seeing officers injure a women in the pelvic area to prevent her from working.
{{ quote
| text= ... it was like he was squeezing a handball or something, but really really hard... it was two guys in a car and they drove up on the sidewalk. He pushed her against the wall and then he pushed her against the wall after he finished that and then he said "now get off the street"...

One respondent reported that an officer followed her for thirty blocks in his civilian car. Another reported that an officer followed her and warned off clients with his bullhorn. Another reported that an officer felt her breasts and made her expose them as cars were driving by while he wrote a ticket. Some statements made by police officers to sex workers:

{{ quote
|text= It's hot tonight, it's a sweep, you should get out of here, now what can you do for me?

You wanna get arrested or you wanna give up some head?

I gave you two cigarettes, you want anything else, you know what you can do for me.

Can I rub against you for $10? [said during arrest]

Either you give me a blow job or I'm going to lock you up.

}}

Several respondents reported having money stolen while being searched or arrested.

A sampling of the false arrest stories:

*A respondent reported getting a summons while waiting to have her hair done. 

*A transwomen who was first arrested for prostitution at age fifteen reported that "I got arrested for prostitution long before I knew what prostitution was." She also said "... they just snatch you coming out of the subway, just because you're a tranny." 

*A ciswoman was approached in a park by an officer who checked and discovered that she had no outstanding warrants. He walked away and another officer approached her and arrested her. She was held for five hours before being released. By way of explanation, a police officer said "See this sheet? All these warrants aren't yours.[sic]"

*Another woman reported being stopped coming out of a grocery store. The police spilled her groceries on the ground and arrested her for prostitution.

This is an article from the Vice website. It opens with an ex-sex worker's story of false arrest; when she turned down an undercover officer's offer of money for sex, the police arrested her anyway. Because of being locked up, she missed a day of classes she needed to start a career outside of sex work. She informed the reporter that it's common for new officers to arrest women walking to the park where she was arrested, even though they're not working. One woman was arrested because the police said she was waving while wearing a low cut top and a miniskirt. Her attorney took pictures of her at arraignment wearing a jacket and pants and got the charges dropped. Another woman was arrested while wearing a peacoat and jeans that "outlined her legs."

A transwoman named Ryhannah Combs was picked up on prostitution charges while running errands. She was carrying no condoms but the arresting officer said she was carrying nine. Instead of being put in a cell, she was chained to a wall. The city settled when she sued.

A staff attorney at the Trafficking Victims Advocacy Project said that the police frequently verbally abused her clients when arresting them, and on multiple occasions have engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior.

Women who are addicted and becoming dope sick are targeted for sex. This was described as "a deal with the Devil," because the police officer will keep coming back for information, sex, or an easy arrest.

Study data was drawn from 1,400 client records from the Legal Aid Society's Exploitation Intervention Project. The researchers also interviewed twenty EIP clients who had had prostitution-related offenses cleared from their record.

Some of the study respondents had positive or neutral experiences with the police, but most of them had overwhelmingly negative experiences: verbal abuse, intimidation, humiliation, sexual harassment, and profiling.

Verbal abuse included slurs, derogatory comments, and refusal to use the person's native language, even when able to do so. Police used humiliation to extract cooperation. One trans woman described particularly intense humiliation, recurring with each arrest.

Some respondents had been propositioned by the police or had police as clients. One respondent described an officer who started off as a client. After their last session he came back the next day in his uniform and arrested her.

Some respondents reported repeated prostitution arrests by the same officer, even when the women weren't working. One woman was arrested while going to the store in pajamas and bedroom slippers. She described another arrest that occurred while she was meeting a cousin for dinner. She was charged even though the cousin came to the police station and told the police what they had been doing. One respondent described a police officer stating that he would lock her up if he saw her on the street.

Some respondents who were trafficked or victims of violence sought help from the police, only to be ridiculed or ignored.

The study sample was fifty two indoor sex workers.

63% of the respondents had police-initiated contact with the police, but 63% of those said the contact was rare. Only one person, a trans woman, had police-initiated contact as often as a couple of times a week. The police in her neighborhood knew her because she had previously worked outdoors. They harassed her, honking at her as she was walking down the street, telling her to go home or they would arrest her, and calling her "Mr." or "homeboy". Another trans woman said the police harassed her because she was transgender.

Several respondents said that during arrests, police took their pictures with personal cameras. They believed the pictures were for the officers' personal use. 12% of respondents had been falsely arrested at least once.

29% of respondents had been taken into custody but released without arrest. The researchers believe the lack of police follow up indicates that there was no basis for taking the people into custody.

14% of respondents had experienced police violence and felt they had no recourse. One woman said she was beaten twice, both times because she refused to give police officers free oral sex. The first time, after she bit the officer's penis, he beat her until she passed out. Another woman was having problems with a particularly violent officer:

{{ quote
| text= One likes to beat me now and then, or he wants me to suck his dick. I mean, it's crazy. He hits me with his gun and gives me these marks on my legs and my back. I don't know what to do...

I can't call the other cops. I did that once and they asked this guy to stop beating me. But he got so mad that he came around and beat me up even worse. So I really have to get out of here. Now he wants me to give him 25% of what I make...

I had to go to the hospital because I got beat so bad.

Four respondents said that police had stolen money. One said that police steal from her about once a year. Two respondents had $4,000 and a laptop stolen from them during an arrest.

16% of respondents said they had been in sexual situations with the police. Some had sex with the police for protection or because the officers were customers, but others were picked up by the police and given the choice between sex and arrest.

Some of the Latinos reported regular police harassment.

The study sample was two hundred eighty three young people selected through RDS.

Most of the respondents had been profiled, but only a small number were profiled for sex work. White and black youth were more likely to be profiled than Latinx. A black Dominican trans woman described moving into Manhattan and talking a walk around her new neighborhood. A police officer stopped her and told her she had better not be "on a stroll." At the time, she didn't know what a stroll was.

For interactions initiated by the police, 38.5% of survey respondents reported being humiliated or verbally abused by police during relatively minor interactions such as checking ID. One respondent said the officer called her a whore, prostitute, and trick. During 8.6% of these interactions, officers confiscated or destroyed safe sex supplies, including condoms. 17.3% of respondents said that police-initiated interactions involved the officer asking for sexual services, or demanding sexual services to avoid arrest. 9.1% of respondents reported being assaulted by police officers. 3 respondents reported strip searches.

Seventy eight respondents were profiled as sex workers and ordered to "move along." The most common result of this was that they ended up in an area where they felt less safe.

75% of trans people and 82.4% of Latinos said they were treated worse than others when they were in lock up.

When the survey respondents initiated contact with the police, usually to report a crime, in a number of cases the police tried to have sex with them. This seemed to be particularly true of trans Latinas.

This is an overview of the literature available at the time of publication on law enforcement abuse of various groups of women. There's a short discussion of sex workers at the end.

Police abuse of sex workers includes verbal insults, coerced sex, brutal beatings, and rape. When police know that a woman is a sex worker, they may harass her when she is not working. 

The most common abuses are verbal abuse and threats to arrest sex workers if the police don't receive sexual services. Police often assume that sex workers don't care who they will have sex with and will do anything to avoid arrest. But experienced street-based sex workers often refuse to provide free services. They are resigned to frequent arrests, including arrests for questionable charges. What they want to avoid are fear and indignity forced on them by bad officers.

One observer describes Chicago police picking up sex workers when the workers are on their way to and from work, and asking for sexual services. New York City police have threatened to shut down sex parlors if they didn't get free sexual services. Women picked up in raids have been taken away in their underwear and had their possessions confiscated.

Trans female sex workers face these and other more complex forms of abuse. If their official documentation doesn't match their gender presentation, they may face verbal abuse and cruel jokes centered around the difference. They may be subjected to unnecessary and illegal strip searches, ostensibly to determine their gender.

Police use sex work to profile people, stop them on the street, intimidate and question them, check for warrants, and often arrest them.

The discussion of sex work ends with the description of two rapes suffered by Mary Barr. In the first, a police officer chased off her client and then told her she might as well have sex with him because the client had already paid. In the second, an officer ordered her into the back seat of his car, told her "do what you do best," and then raped her.

During arrest or taking someone into custody, police often degrade or humiliate sex workers, including removing wigs or clothing, confiscating or destroying property, making homophobic, anti-transgender, and racists slurs, and engaging on sexual harassment. Organizations working with sex workers have documented a pattern of police practice that includes assault, sexual harassment, public strip searches for the purpose of viewing genitalia, and rape. This pattern of practice is supported by the difficulty or impossibility of obtaining justice in these cases. 

Police are able to extend this abuse from sex workers to trans women and women of color by profiling them as sex workers. A study in Los Angeles of Latina trans women found that 42% reported being solicited for sex by law enforcement and 24% reported being sexually abused by police officers.

When sex workers try to report crimes against them, officers don't take their complaints seriously, refuse to file a report, and may arrest them, physically assault them, or pressure them for sex. When a sex worker tried to bring charges against a security guard who handcuffed and raped her, the police referred to the guard as "a big teddy bear", and added exculpatory statements to her report that she didn't make. This refusal to deal with crimes against sex workers leads serial killers to target sex workers and people profiled as sex workers.

While most witnesses who are in danger because of their testimony are put in witness protection programs, sex workers are pressured to testify by putting them in jail, exposing them to witness intimidation and denying them their right to liberty. An African-American trans female sex worker was placed in the mens' jail in Baltimore in an effort to compel her to testify in a violent crime case. Police in some areas force sex workers to participate in drug stings, exposing them to violence from the people targeted by the stings.

In New York, transgender and gender non-conforming people are often profiled as sex workers and arrested. They then have to decide whether to request being held as a "special category" prisoner. If they make the request, police are often harsh, holding them alone in a back cell longer than usual or assaulting them. If no empty cells are available, police chain them to a desk or metal bar, often for hours at a time. If they don't make the request, they may be put in a cell where they aren't safe, or the police may incite trouble with the other prisoners by saying "here's another [anti-LGBT slur] for you."

Police discourage the use of condoms by using condoms as evidence, or they destroy condoms and safe sex supplies. This encourages the spread of HIV and STIs. Carrying condoms may also be a signal for sexual harassment, cuing police to ask intrusive questions about sexual orientation and gender identity, touch inappropriately, and make disparaging comments. Police particularly target young women of color and trans youth and gender non-conforming youth of color.

Sex workers with severe injuries from violent attacks are often belittled and blamed for the attacks, and police often don't escort them or refer them to medical care. People in medical facilities seeking care for injuries from attacks have been accusingly questioned by police officers when they were profiled as sex workers.

The study sample consisted of fifteen woman who were sex workers, trafficked victims, or both.

Six of the twelve women who had been trafficking victims left their trafficking situation without help from law enforcement, through the help of a coworker or an attorney they met through a coworker or friend. Nationwide, it appears that the majority of trafficking victims escape without the involvement of law enforcement. One supervisor in a national organization said that 90% of their cases were not produced by raids or identified by law enforcement.

(N.b. Most people who fit the legal definition of trafficking victim seem to exit trafficking without any organizational help. In a study of underage sex workers in NYC, only 2% said they would ever go to a service organization if they were in trouble.&lt;ref name="curtisNYC"/&gt; On the whole, they age out of sex work rather than being "rescued." Young sex workers studied in NYC and Atlantic City experienced greater control over their work over time, regardless of whether they had pimps.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Overall, it appears that the majority of people who fall under the category of trafficking victim exit the category through their own efforts. Only a minority of trafficking victims exit trafficking with help from organizations created to help them. Of that minority, only a further minority, perhaps 10%, are identified by law enforcement. And this study suggests that most of the people picked up in raids could have been rescued or self-rescued in other, less traumatic ways, had they been aware of the help available to them.)

Of the six trafficking victims picked up in law enforcement raids, one would have left her situation in a few days if she had not been picked up in a raid and arrested. As a result of the raid, she was pistol-whipped by a police officer and incarcerated. Her conclusion:

{{ quote
| text= A better way to help leave my situation would be anything that didn't involve the police.
}}

Another would have left on her own if she had known where to go, and another said that she would have preferred leaving with a coworker rather than being picked up in a raid. One didn't know another way to escape, but still thought the raid was "terrible." Had these women known of the resources available to trafficked people, they very likely could have left on their own and gotten the assistance they needed without the trauma or injury of a raid.

Raids often involve intimidation, verbal abuse, excessive force, and sexual harassment. Raids result in detention and deportation of trafficking victims who are afraid to come forward, or who come forward and aren't believed. Victims who aren't detained or deported are often terrorized into silence. 

The respondents who experienced raids didn't know which government agency was raiding them, and in one case initially knew only that they were being attacked by people carrying guns. They didn't know what purpose the raids had, other than to detain and deport them, and they didn't know what was going to happen to them.

The women who left trafficking situations on their own, without being traumatized by a law enforcement raid, were better able to cooperate in the prosecution of their traffickers.

[[File:Qurban in Pekanbaru (1).JPG|thumb|Qurban in [[Indonesia]].]]
'''''Qurbanī''''' ({{lang-ar|قربانى}}), '''''Qurban''''', or '''''uḍḥiyyah''''' ({{lang|ar|أضحية}}) as referred to in [[Islamic law]], is the sacrifice of a livestock animal during [[Eid al-Adha]]. The word is related to the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|קרבן}} ''[[Qorban|qorbān]]'' "offering" and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''qurbānā'' "sacrifice", etymologised through the cognate Arabic [[triliteral]] as "a way or means of approaching someone" or "nearness".&lt;ref&gt;Ambros, Arne Amadeus. 2004. A Concise Dictionary of Koranic Arabic. Wiesbaden: Reichert. P. 2Gg22 [Q-R-B]&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic law, udhiyyah would refer to the sacrifice of a specific animal, offered by a specific person, on specific days to seek [[God in Islam|God]]'s pleasure and reward. The word qurban appears thrice in the [[Quran]]: once in reference to animal sacrifice and twice referring to &lt;span lang="pt" dir="ltr"&gt;sacrifice&lt;/span&gt; in the general sense of any act which may bring one closer to God. In contrast, ''[[dhabīḥah]]'' refers to normal Islamic slaughter outside the day of udhiyyah.

== &lt;span lang="pt" dir="ltr"&gt;Origins&lt;/span&gt; ==
{{one source|section|date=November 2016}}
[[Islam]] traces the history of sacrifice back to [[Abel]] and [[Cain]] ([[Habil and Qabil]]), whose story is mentioned in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|5|27|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abel]] was the first human being to sacrifice an animal for [[God in Islam|God]]. [[Ibn Kathir]] narrates that Abel had offered a sheep whilst his brother Cain offered part of the crops of his land. The ordained procedure of God was that a fire would descend from the heavens and consume the accepted sacrifice. Accordingly, a fire came down and enveloped the animal slaughtered by Abel thus accepting the sacrifice of Abel while Cain's sacrifice was rejected. This led to jealousy on the part of Cain resulting in the first human death when he murdered his brother [[Abel]]. After not seeking repentance for his actions, Cain was not forgiven by God.

=== Ibrahim's sacrifice ===
The practice of qurbani can be traced back to  [Ibrahim], who dreamt that God ordered him to sacrifice his son. Ibrahim agreed to follow God's command and perform the sacrifice, however, God intervened and informed him that his sacrifice had been accepted. Unlike the Bible, there is no mention in the Qur'an of an animal (ram) replacing the boy, rather he is replaced with a 'great sacrifice'. Since the sacrifice of a ram cannot be greater than that of ibrahim's son (and a prophet in Islam at that), this replacement seems to point to either the religious institutionalisation of sacrifice itself, or to the future self-sacrifices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions (who were destined to emerge from the progeny of Ishmael) in the cause of their faith. From that day onward, every Eid al-Adha once a year, Muslims around the world slaughter an animal to commemorate Ibrahim's sacrifice and to remind themselves of abnegation.

=== Wisdom of sacrifice ===
The philosophy behind ''udhiyyah'' is that it is a demonstration of submission to God, complete obedience to God's will or command and sacrificing everything for his pleasure. Ibrahim demonstrated this spirit of submission and sacrifice in the best possible manner. When confronted with the challenge of love and allegiance, he chose to submit unconditionally to God and suppressed personal desire and love for his family and child. Qurbani calls for the slaughter of one's innate desires by placing the knife of courage and resistance on hatred, jealousy, pride, greed, animosity, love for the world and other such maladies of the heart.

== Ritual sacrifice ==
{{unsourced|section|date=November 2016}}
In [[Islam]], the sacrifice of an animal is legal from the morning of the 10th to sunset of the 13th ''[[Dhu al-Hijjah|Dhu l-Hijjah]]'', the 12th lunar month of the [[Islamic calendar]]. On these days [[Muslims]] all over the world offer Qurbani which means a sacrifice/ slaughter of an animal on specific days for the pleasure of [[Allah]]. It is understood as a symbolic repetition of [[Ibrahim]]'s sacrifice of a ram in place of his son, a crucial notion in [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]] alike. Islamic preachers would use the occasion to comment on the fact that [[Islam]] is a religion of sacrifice and use this opportunity to remind [[Muslim]]s of their duty of serving mankind with their time, effort and wealth.

Most schools of ''[[fiqh]]'' accept that the animal must be slaughtered according to the laws of ''[[dhabihah]]''  and that the animal in question must be a domesticated goat, sheep, cow or camel.

The '''SS ''Columbia Eagle'' incident''' refers to a [[mutiny]] that occurred aboard the U.S. flagged merchant vessel ''Columbia Eagle'' in March 1970 when two crewmembers seized the vessel with the threat of a bomb and forced the master to sail to [[Cambodia]]. The ship was under contract with the [[Military Sea Transportation Service]] to carry [[napalm]] bombs to be used by the [[U.S. Air Force]] during the Vietnam War and was originally bound for [[Sattahip]], [[Thailand]]. During the mutiny, 24 of the crew were forced into two lifeboats and set adrift in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] while the remainder of the crew were forced to take the ship to a bay near [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]], Cambodia. The two mutineers requested political asylum from the Cambodian government which was initially granted but they were later arrested and jailed. ''Columbia Eagle'' was returned to U.S. control in April 1970.&lt;ref name="six_famous_naval _mutinies_2012_11_06_history_com"&gt;Andrews, Evan, [http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/6-famous-naval-mutinies "6 Famous Naval Mutinies,"] November 6, 2012, ''History in the Headlines'' newsletter, retrieved March 1, 2018 from '''History.com''' .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia_eagle_mutiny_1970_03_16_cbs"&gt;[[Walter Cronkite|Cronkite, Walter,]] and [[Nelson Benton]], [https://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/programs/208706 "Columbia Eagle / Mutiny / Cambodia," segment #208707], in transcript: ''[[CBS Evening News]] for 1970-03-16,'' from the [[Vanderbilt Television News Archive]], [[Vanderbilt University]], retrieved March 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="us_bomb_ship_1970_03_16_san_berdo_sun"&gt;Hoffman, Fred S., [[Associated Press]], [https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SBS19700316.1.2 "U.S. Bomb Ship Seized in Mutiny: Anchored Off Cambodia"], March 16, 1970, ''San Bernardino Sun,'' [[San Bernardino, California]], Volume 76, Number 137, pp.1-2, photocopy at retrieved March 1, 2018 from [[optical character recognition|OCR transcription]] in '''[https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SBS19700316.1.2 California Digital Newspaper Collection]'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mutiny_involved_five_1970_03_19_tennesseean"&gt;[https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SBS19700316.1.2 "Mutiny Involved 5: Captain,"], March 19, 1970,  ''[[The Tennessean|Nashville Tennessean]],'' Page 13 retrieved March 1, 2018 from [[optical character recognition|OCR transcription]] in '''Newspapers.com''' .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="us_asks_return_of_ship_1970_03_25_nytimes"&gt; [https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/26/archives/two-who-say-they-support-sds-tell-how-they-hijacked-ship.html "U.S. Asks Return of Ship,"] March 25, 1970, (appended to end of subsequent March 26, 1970 article "Two Who Say They Support S.D.S.

==Background==

===''Columbia Eagle''===
The ''Columbia Eagle'' was a [[Victory ship|Victory-type]] cargo ship constructed by [[Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation]] of Portland, Oregon in 1945 for the U.S. Navy and originally christened ''Pierre Victory''. She was designed to carry all types of dry supplies and munitions to both the European and Pacific theaters of World War II. Like most of the ships of the Victory-type, ''Pierre Victory'' was decommissioned after the war and either mothballed or sold to commercial shipping companies. In 1968, she was purchased by the Columbia Steamship Company, renamed ''Columbia Eagle'' and contracted out to the Military Sea Transportation Service for the purpose of hauling supplies and ammunition to Southeast Asian ports in South Vietnam and Thailand during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=Linnett67&gt;Linnett, pp 67–68&lt;/ref&gt; Because ''Columbia Eagle'' was a U.S. flagged ship, she was a part of the Merchant Marine and therefore eligible under government contracting rules to haul military supplies to the war zone.&lt;ref name=Cutler142&gt;Cutler, p 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Clyde William McKay, Jr.===
Clyde McKay was born on 20 May 1944 near [[Hemet, California]]. His father was in the military at the time and often had duty away from the family. While a teenager, he suffered a misdiagnosed bowel obstruction and was seriously ill for a year. Because of this, he lost a year in school and never finished high school and decided to join the merchant marine. McKay received his [[Merchant Mariner's Document|merchant marine documents]] on 23 October 1963 and joined the [[Seafarers International Union]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=Linnett13&gt;Linnett, pp 13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alvin Leonard Glatkowski===
Alvin Glatkowski was born on 11 September 1949 at [[Augusta, Georgia]]. His father was also in the military at the time of his birth but shortly after Glatkowski was born, his father abandoned the family. His mother married a Navy third-class machinist mate named Ralph Hagan when Glatkowski was three. Hagan was abusive to Glatkowski when he was home, but was often on duty or cruises and Glatkowski learned to be independent at an early age. As a teenager, Glatkowski assumed the role of head of the household when Hagan was at sea and this made Hagan very angry when he returned home. He often took out his frustrations on Glatkowski violently, which led him to leave home at eighteen. Glatkowski went to New York and enrolled in the [[Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship]] operated by the [[Seafarers International Union]]. Lundeberg School taught the skills needed to get deck, engine and steward jobs on merchant marine ships. On 17 April 1967, Glatkowski received his merchant mariner papers stating he was eligible for entry-level jobs on U.S. flagged ships.&lt;ref name=Linnett43&gt;Linnett, pp 43–56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutiny===
On 14 March 1970, McKay and Glatkowski used guns they had smuggled aboard to seize control of their ship, SS ''Columbia Eagle'', in the first armed [[mutiny]] aboard an American ship in 150 years.  The ship had been sailing on a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] supply charter carrying napalm to the [[U.S. Air Force]] bases in [[Thailand]] for use in the [[Vietnam War]].

The mutineers claimed that there was a live bomb on board the ship, and forced the captain to order 24 of the crewmen to abandon ship in the lifeboats.  The ship's cargo, 3,500 500-pound bombs and 1,225 750-pound bombs, gave this threat credibility.

When the crewmen departed in lifeboats, a [[SOS]] was transmitted.  Lieutenant Commander Bob Scalf and his VP-1 Crew 6, the famed "Scalf Hunters", operating their P-3B from Utapao, Thailand, were directed to launch on a search and rescue (SAR) mission to find the SS ''Columbia Eagle'' and assist as needed.  Upon arrival at the ship and noticing a small crew and the presence of small arms, Crew 6 immediately reported the hijacking and their assessment that the ship was heading for Cambodia. Communications and status reporting was maintained until they were relieved on station. Crew 6 was awarded a well-done from CTF-72 for their actions.

Other P-3 Orion aircrews relieved VP-1 Crew 6 and each other to keep the Columbia Eagle under constant surveillance while events unfolded.  Among them was VP-22 Crew 3, piloted by Lieutenant Commander Norman "Chips" Koehler, which launched on short notice from Sangley Point in the Philippines.

The merchant ship ''Rappahanock'' picked up the lifeboats and crew members and broadcast the news of the mutiny.  The [[United States Coast Guard]] cutter {{USCGC|Mellon|WHEC-717|2}} was the first US military vessel on station, pursuing the ''Columbia Eagle''.  The [[amphibious transport dock]] {{USS|Denver|LPD-9|6}} was diverted to relieve ''Mellon'' in its pursuit.  The destroyer, USS Turner Joy, DD951, was detached from station at I Corps to pursue the Columbia Eagle at flank speed and to intervene. However, the ''Columbia Eagle'' reached Cambodian waters before any U.S. naval assets could intercept.&lt;ref name="NHHC2"&gt;{{cite web|title=1970 Command History of USS ''Denver'' (LPD-9)|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/d/lpd-9/1970.pdf|work=Command Operations Reports|publisher=US Navy Naval History and Heritage Command|pages=2–3|format=pdf|accessdate=31 May 2013}}{{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With only 13 crewmen remaining aboard besides themselves, the mutineers sailed into Cambodian waters, where they assumed they would be welcomed as heroes. They anchored within the 12-mile (22.2&amp;nbsp;km) territorial limit claimed by [[Cambodia]] on the afternoon of 15 March.

At 0951 on 16 March, ''Denver'' anchored 15.6 miles (28.9&amp;nbsp;km) from the coast in the [[Gulf of Siam]], remaining outside Cambodian waters.  ''Mellon'' joined shortly thereafter with Commander, Amphibious Squadron Seven, as the senior officer present.  Two [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] [[helicopter]]s landed on ''Denver'' from bases in [[Vietnam]] to assist in visual surveillance.  Meanwhile, the mutineers had turned the ship over to Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]]'s government, declared themselves anti-war revolutionaries, and were granted asylum.&lt;ref name="NHHC2" /&gt;

On 17 March, the helicopters were detached and ''Denver'', with Commander, Amphibious Squadron Seven, departed for Singapore, passing on-scene command to ''Mellon''.&lt;ref name="NHHC2" /&gt;
"Turner Joy" remained on station in a cruising pattern within shipping lanes and in sight of the harbor channel.

On 18 March at 0636, ''Denver'' reversed her course; Prince Sihanouk had been [[Cambodian coup of 1970|deposed by a coup]] led by the pro-U.S. [[Sirik Matak]] and [[Lon Nol]].  If the Cambodians could be persuaded to release ''Columbia Eagle'', ''Denver'''s flight deck could help the rescued crew members rejoin their ship. The coup was unfortunate for McKay and Glatkowski; they had hoped to find asylum in a pro-Communist country; instead, they became prisoners of the new Cambodian government.  At 2359 on 18 March, ''Denver'' anchored in the Gulf of Siam 17.0 miles (31.5&amp;nbsp;km) from the coast of Cambodia.&lt;ref name="NHHC2" /&gt;

Sihanouk, now in exile, charged that the CIA had masterminded the mutiny to deliver weapons to Lon Nol. Both the mutineers and U.S. officials denied his charges, but the damage was done; no Communist forces would shelter the mutineers after they were labeled as CIA stooges.

When it became clear that ''Columbia Eagle'''s release was not imminent, ''Denver'' was detached to proceed to [[Da Nang]].&lt;ref name="NHHC2" /&gt;

On 8 April, ''Columbia Eagle'' was permitted to leave Cambodian waters. She rendezvoused with {{USCGC|Chase|WHEC-718|6}} where a Navy [[explosive ordnance disposal]] team inspected the ship while ''Chase'' departed to [[Phu Quoc|An Thoi]] to pick up the ''Columbia Eagle'' crew and return them to the ship. With the crew and ship reunited, ''Chase'' escorted her to [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay]] arriving 12 April.&lt;ref name=CNFVMHS0470&gt;{{cite web|title=Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam (April 1970)|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/ar/docs/comnavforv/1970/April1970.pdf|work=Monthly Historical Summary, April 1970|publisher=Naval Historical Center, U.S. Navy|pages=31–32|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
McKay and Glatkowski were held by the post-coup Cambodian government for several months after their capture.  A United Press newspaper interview from August 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manson Hero to Hijackers|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VwsrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D5oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6829%2C3027306|accessdate=20 June 2014|work=Reading Eagle|date=26 August 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes them as living under guard in "a rusting World War II landing ship moored in the Mekong River," regularly using marijuana supplied by their guards, and making statements supporting the [[Manson Family]] and violent overthrow of the United States government.

After months of imprisonment, Glatkowski was extradited to the United States to face trial. He was charged with mutiny, kidnapping, assault and neglect of duty, convicted, and served his sentence. He has admitted to mistakes in the hijacking but remains unapologetic about their goal of interrupting the napalm shipment.

McKay escaped from his captors along with U.S. Army deserter Larry Humphrey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pownetwork.org/bios/h/h139.htm Biography of L. Humphrey in pownetwork.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and sought out the [[Khmer Rouge]].&lt;ref name=Linnett228&gt;Linnett, pp 228–232&lt;/ref&gt; He was officially declared missing on 4 November 1970 and has never been located by the authorities.  However, Richard Linnett and Roberto Loiederman, co-authors of ''The Eagle Mutiny'', wrote an article, entitled "The Last Mutineer",&lt;ref&gt;Richard Linnett and Roberto Loiederman, [https://richardlinnett.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/the-last-mutineer.pdf "The Last Mutineer"], ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''. February 2005. Retrieved on 22 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; for the February 2005 issue of ''[[Penthouse magazine|Penthouse]]'' in which they report that remains brought back from Cambodia were positively identified as Clyde McKay's at the Central Identification Laboratory - Hawaii (CILHI), the U.S. Navy's forensic lab in Hawaii. Subsequently, the remains were cremated and the ashes were buried in the family plot in Hemet, California, where McKay had spent his youth.

'''''Speech of Universal History''''' or '''''Discours sur l'histoire universelle''''' in original French (1681) is a work of theology and philosophy from French Roman Catholic bishop [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]]. It is regarded by many Catholics as a continuation or actualization of [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]’s the ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' (''[[De Civitate Dei]]''). It proposes, much like the ''City of God'', a metaphysical appreciation of universal history as an actual war between God and the Devil.

==Spiritual warfare==
In this war, God moves (by divine intervention/ [[Divine providence]]) those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Catholic Church (the City of God)  in order to oppose by all means (including military) those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Devil (the City of the Devil). While the City of God is always the Church and those movements or governments that support it, the City of the Devil changes significantly with the centuries.

==In Catholic doctrine==
This concept of universal history is actual part of the official doctrine of the [[Catholic Church]] as was most recently stated in the [[Second Vatican Council|Second Vatican Council']] s ''[[Gaudium et Spes]]'' document: "The Church ... holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key, the focal point and the goal of man, as well as of all human history...all of human life, whether individual or collective, shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good and evil, between light and darkness...The Lord is the goal of human history the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization, the center of the human race, the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings" (GS 10, 13, 45).

==Key points==
The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Thomas Oestreich (1913). Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company.&lt;/ref&gt;depicts the key point of ''Speech of Universal History'' as follows:

“…This is why the idea of Providence is at the same time the law of history. If the crash of empires "falling one upon another" does not in truth express some purpose of God regarding humanity, then history, or what is called by that name, is indeed no longer anything but a chaotic chronology, the meaning of which we should strive in vain to disentangle. In that case, fortune, or rather chance, would be the mistress of human affairs; the existence of humanity would be only a bad dream, or phantasmagoria, whose changing face would be inadequate to mask a void of nothingness. We should be fretting ourselves in that void without reason and almost without cause, our very actions would be but phantoms, and the only result of so many efforts accumulated through so many thousands of years would be the conviction, every day more clear, of their uselessness, which would be another void of nothingness.

And why, after all, were there Greeks and Romans? Of what use was [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]]? [[Battle of Actium|Actium]]? [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]]? [[Battle of Lepanto|Lepanto]]? Why was there a [[Caesar]], and a [[Charlemagne]]? Let us frankly own, then, that unless something Divine circulates in history, there is no history.

Nations like individuals, live only by maintaining uninterrupted communication with God, and it is precisely this condition of their existence which is called by the name of [[Divine providence|Providence]]. Providence is the condition or the possibility of history, as the stability of the laws of nature is the condition of the possibility of science. ..It was Providence that made of the Jewish people a people apart, a unique people, the chosen people, charged with maintaining and defending the worship of the true God throughout the pagan centuries, against the prestige of an idolatry which essentially consisted in the deification of the energies of nature. It was Providence that, by means of Roman unity and of its extension throughout the known universe, rendered not only possible but easy and almost necessary, the conversion of the world to Christianity .It was Providence, again, that developed the features of the modern world out of the disorder of barbarous invasions and reconciled the two antiquities under the law of Christ. If the action of Providence is manifest anywhere, it is in the sequence of the history of Christianity. And what is more natural under the circumstances than to make of its history the demonstration of its truth?"

The '''Stenborg theatre''', also called '''Svenska Komiska Teatern''', '''Komiska Teatern''' and '''Munkbroteatern''', was a historical Swedish 18th century theatre, active between 1784 and 1799 in [[Gamla stan]] in [[Stockholm]]. It was the second theatre of Stockholm during the Gustavian age. In 1784-87, before the inauguration of the theatre of Ristell in [[Bollhuset]], it was the only dramatic theatre of the native language in Stockholm.   

== History ==

===Background===
The Stenborg theatre was a continuation of the famous [[Stenborg Troupe]]; when the first Swedish national theatre at [[Bollhuset]] was closed in 1753–54, half of the troupe performed in various localities in the city under the leadership of [[Petter Stenborg]]. When the national stage was re-established by king [[Gustav III of Sweden]] in 1773, it did not include the old Stenborg troupe. In 1780, the troupe had finally acquired a proper house to perform in; Eriksbergsteatern, (The Eriksberg Theatre), and in 1781, the leadership was taken over by Petter Stenborg son, Carl Stenborg. In 1780–84, the Eriksberg Theatre was the only permanent theatre on the native language in Stockholm.        

The Erikberg Theatre was uncomfortably outside of town, and the Stenborg troupe under Carl Stenborg searched for a new building. They made a partnership with the rich brewer [[Christina Nyman]], who wanted to establish a theatre in Gamla stan and had obtained a permission to do so. The theatre was housed in a large building erected in Gamla Stan in 1782; the first floor housed four taverns and several apartments, while the second floor was reserved for the Stenborg troupe. From 1784, it was formally named ''Svenska komiska Teatern'' (Swedish Comical Theatre) or ''Svenska Teatern'' (Swedish Theatre) and from 1788 ''Komiska Teatern'' (Comedy Theatre). It was also known as ''Munkbroteatern'' (The Munkbro Theatre), after its location. The common name for it was always the Stenborg Theatre. 

===Activity===
The theatre was luxuriously decorated and was in 1784 called the biggest theatre in the country. The theatrically interested king was present at its premier and gave away gifts to its performers. However, it did not have the same status as the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] and [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] and was considered much less formal: it was a place for less formal and solemn performances, a place for satirical comedy and such, and foreigners sometimes compared it to a boulevard-theatre of the kind that was popular in [[Paris]].    I also performed less formal opera and musicals. ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' had its Swedish premiere here in 1785, as well as ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' in 1792.    Also foreign guest-artists and [[circus]]-performances were given here; in the autumn of 1793, the English circus-company of Peter and James Price performed acrobatics and tight-rope-dancing here, were the four-year-old Louise Price danced on a rope. The theater's status as a less serious theatre did not stop actors from the Royal Swedish Opera and the Royal Dramatic Theatre to appear there; even [[Elisabeth Olin]] had performed here, and it was in fact used by actors and singers to work in during their conflicts with the managements with their regular stages.   

The director Carl Stenborg, who was a celebrated [[opera singer]] at the Royal Swedish Opera, resided in one of the apartments, where he and his wife, the singer Betty Olin, hosted gatherings and parties for the cultural elite of the city. The theatre often took their staff from the choir at the Royal Opera, but it also took in its own students. An advertisement in 1786 read as follows: 
:"If some common parents, who own children of a beautiful appearance and a good voice, would like to have them educated, for their own benefit, in a talent which may be beneficial to their future, they may have an education and a reward answering to their ability, when they enlist at the royal secretary Stenborg at the New Swedish theatre house at Munkbron".&lt;ref&gt;Johan Flodmark : Stenborgska skådebanorna (The Stenborg Stages) {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closure===
In 1798, the new monopoly of the royal theaters was proclaimed in the city of Stockholm, and the Stenborg theatre was closed the year after (the monopoly was in effect until 1842). The building itself was torn down in 1899.

'''Stumptown Comics Fest''' was a [[comic book convention]], held annually in [[Portland, Oregon]] from 2004–2013. In the model of the [[Alternative Press Expo]] and the [[Small Press Expo]], Stumptown was a forum for artists, writers and publishers of comic art in its various forms to expose the public to comics not typically accessible through normal commercial channels.

== History ==
The Stumptown Comics Fest originated in early 2004 with a small group of Portland-area cartoonists (led by Indigo Kelleigh)&lt;ref name=Hallet2013&gt;Hallett, Alison. [http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/10-year-itch/Content?oid=9145182 "10-Year Itch: Checking in with the Stumptown Comics Fest,"] ''Portland Mercury'' (Apr. 24, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; who yearned for a convention that focused on the art of comics instead of the business of comics. In a space of four months they were able to put on the first comics fest on June 6, 2004, at the Old Church, a non-profit organization whose goal was to preserve an old church. The first show featured 22 exhibitor tables, and attracted 150 attendees.

In 2005 the show moved to  [[Portland State University]]'s Smith Memorial Ballroom, and grew to 80 exhibitor tables and 450 attendees.

In 2006 the event moved to the [[Oregon Convention Center]] and expanded to two days.

In 2007, the event began hosting the Stumptown Comics Fest Trophy Awards and Comic Art Battle. The awards honored outstanding small creators and comics, while the Comic Art Battle was described as "a cross between [[Pictionary]] and wrestling."&lt;ref name=Turnquist2010 /&gt;

In 2012 the show changed hands, with Kelleigh passing on the reins to Shawna Gore;&lt;ref name=Hallet2013 /&gt; in addition, the new organizers achieved nonprofit status.&lt;ref name=Hallett2 /&gt;

After the 10th annual show in 2013, Stumptown went "on hiatus" and entered an operating agreement with [[Rose City Comic Con]].&lt;ref name=Hallett2&gt;Hallett, Alison.

The '''Taiwan Miracle''' ({{zh|t=台灣奇蹟 or 臺灣奇蹟|p=Táiwān Qíjì}}) or '''Taiwan Economic Miracle''' refers to the rapid [[industrialization]] and [[economic growth]] of [[Taiwan]] during the latter half of the twentieth century. As it has developed alongside [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]] and [[Hong Kong]], Taiwan became known as one of the "[[Four Asian Tigers]]".

==Background==
After a period of [[hyperinflation]] in the late 1940s when the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) military regime of [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] overprinted the new Taiwan Yuan against the previous Japan Taiwan Yen, it became clear that a new and stable currency was needed. Along with the $4 billion in financial aid and soft credit provided by the US (as well as the indirect economic stimulus of US food and military aid) over the 1945-1965 period, Taiwan had the necessary capital to restart its economy. Further, the KMT government instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted on [[mainland China]].

A [[land reform]] law, inspired by the same one that the Americans were enacting in occupied [[Japan]], removed the landlord class (In a similar manner as Japan), and created a higher number of peasants whom, with the help of the [[sovereign state|state]], increased the agricultural output dramatically. This was the first excedent accumulation source.&lt;ref name="historycooperative.org"&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/85/minns.html#FOOT16 Minns, John and Robert Tierney, The Labour Movement in Taiwan. Labour History 85 (Nov 2003): 92 pars. 27 Dec. 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; It inverted capital creation, and liberated the agricultural workforce to work in the urban sectors. However, the government imposed on the peasants an unequal exchange with the industrial economy, with credit and fertilizer controls and a non monetary exchange to trade agrarian products (machinery) for rice. With the control of the banks (at the time, being the property of the [[government]]), and import licenses, the state oriented the Taiwanese economy to import substitutive industrialization, creating initial capitalism in a fully protected [[Market (economics)|market]].

It also, with the help of [[USAID]], created a massive industrial infrastructure, communications, and developed the educational system. Several government bodies were created and four-year plans were also enacted. Between 1952 and 1982, economic growth was on average 8.7%, and between 1983 and 1986 at 6.9%. The [[gross national product]] grew by 360% between 1965 and 1986. The percentage of global exports was over 2% in 1986, over other recently industrialized countries, and the global industrial production output grew a further 680% between 1965 and 1986. The social gap between the rich and the poor fell (Gini: 0.558 in 1953, 0.303 in 1980), even lower than some Western European countries, but it grew a little in the 80's. Health care, education, and  quality of life also improved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwan.com.au/Polieco/History/ROC/report04.html The Story of Taiwan, Economy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202032138/http://www.taiwan.com.au/Polieco/History/ROC/report04.html |date=2010-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of that was made possible through US economic aid, subsidizing the higher cost of domestic production. The flexibility of the productive system and the industrial structure meant that Taiwanese companies had more chances to adapt themselves to the changing international situation and the global economy.

In 1959, a 19-point program of Economic and Financial Reform, liberalized market controls, stimulated exports and designed a strategy to attract foreign companies and foreign capitals. An exports processing area was created in [[Kaohsiung]] and in 1964, [[General Instrument]]s pioneered in externalizing electronic assembly in Taiwan. Japanese companies moved in to benefit of low salaries, the lack of environmental laws and controls, a well-educated and capable workforce, and the support of the [[Government]]. But the nucleus of the industrial structure was national, and it was composed by a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises, created within families with the family savings, and savings cooperatives nets (會 [[Pinyin]]: [[Hui (secret society)|Huì]]). They had the support of the government in the form of [[subsidies]] and [[Credit (finance)|credits]] loaned by the banks.

Most of this Huì appeared for the first time in rural zones near metropolitan areas, where families shared work (in the parcels they owned and in the industrial workshops at the same time). For instance, in 1989 in [[Changhua County|Changhua]], small enterprises produced almost 50% of the world's umbrellas. The State attracted foreign companies in order to obtain more [[Financial capital|capital]] and to get access to foreign markets, but the big foreign companies got contracts with this huge net of small sized, familiar and national companies, which were a very important percentage of the industrial output.

Foreign investment never represented an important component in the Taiwanese economy, with the notable exception of the electronic market. For instance, in 1981, direct foreign investment was a mere 2% of the [[GNP]], foreign companies employed 4.8% of the total workforce, their production was 13.9% of the total production and their exports were 25.6% of nationwide exports. Access to the global markets was facilitated by the Japanese companies and by the American importers, who wanted a direct relationship with the Taiwanese brands. No big [[multinational corporation]]s were created (like in [[Singapore]]), or huge national conglomerates (like [[South Korea]]n [[chaebol]]s), but some industrial groups, with the support of the government, grew, and became in the 90's huge companies totally internationalized.

Most of the development was thanks to the flexibility of family businesses which produced for foreign traders established in Taiwan and for international trade nets with the help of intermediaries. But the state was the central organism which coordinated the industrialization process, it created the infrastructures, it attracted foreign investment, it decided the strategic priorities and, when necessary, recurred to impose its conditions.

==Era of globalization==
In the 1970s, protectionism was on the rise, and the [[United Nations]] switched recognition from the [[Republic of China]] to the [[People's Republic of China]] as the sole legitimate representative of all [[China]]. It was expelled by [[General Assembly Resolution 2758]] and replaced in all UN organs with the PRC. The [[KMT]] began a process of enhancement and modernization of the industry, mainly in high technology (such as [[microelectronics]], [[personal computers]] and [[peripheral]]s). One of the biggest and most successful Technology Parks was built in [[Hsinchu]], near [[Taipei]].

Many Taiwanese brands became important suppliers of worldwide known firms such as DEC or [[IBM]], while other established branches in [[Silicon Valley]] and other places inside the [[United States]] and became known. The government also recommended the textile and clothing industries to enhance the quality and value of their products to avoid restrictive import quotas, usually measured in volume. The decade also saw the beginnings of a [[Labor movement in Taiwan|genuinely independent union movement]] after decades of repression. Some significant events occurred in 1977, which gave the new [[trade union|unions]] a boost.

One was the formation of an independent union at the Far East Textile Company after a two-year effort discredited the former management-controlled union. This was the first union that existed independently of the KMT in Taiwan's post-war history (although the KMT retained a minority membership on its committee). Rather than prevailing upon the state to use [[martial law]] to smash the union, the management adopted the more cautious approach of buying workers' votes at election times. However, such attempts repeatedly failed and, by 1986, all of the elected leaders were genuine unionists.&lt;ref name="historycooperative.org"/&gt; Another, and, historically, the most important, was the now called "[[Zhongli incident]]".

In the 1980s, Taiwan had become an economic power, with a mature and diversified economy, solid presence in international markets and huge [[foreign exchange reserves]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://investintaiwan.nat.gov.tw/en/env/stats/foreign_exchange.html Foreign Exchange Reserves, Taiwan and other major countries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040920012854/http://investintaiwan.nat.gov.tw/en/env/stats/foreign_exchange.html |date=2004-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its companies were able to go abroad, internationalize their production, investing massively in Asia (mainly in [[People's Republic of China|China]]) and in other [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] countries, mainly in the [[United States]].

Higher salaries and better organized [[trade unions]] in [[Taiwan]], together with the reduction of the Taiwanese [[export quota]]s meant that the bigger Taiwanese companies moved their production to [[China]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The [[civil society]] in a now developed country, wanted democracy, and the rejection of the KMT [[dictatorship]] was bigger day by day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwan.com.au/Polieco/History/ROC/report02.html The Story of Taiwan, Politics]&lt;/ref&gt; A major step occurred when [[Lee Teng-hui]], a native from [[Taiwan]], became [[President]], and the KMT started a new path searching for democratic legitimacy.

Two aspects must be remembered: the KMT was on the center of the structure and controlled the process, and that the structure was a net made of relations between the enterprises, between the enterprises and the State, between the enterprises and the global market thanks to trade companies and the international economic exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Castells: Information Age, Third Volume, The End of The Millennium, page 303, Alianza Editorial, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Native Taiwanese were largely excluded from the mainlanders dominated government, so many went into the business world.

In 1952, Taiwan had a per capita gross national product (GNP) of $170, placing the island's economy squarely between Zaire and Congo. But, by 2010 Taiwan's per capita GNP, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), had soared to $35,227, similar to that of developed West European economies and Japan.

According to economist [[Paul Krugman]], the rapid growth was made possible by increases in capital and labor but not an increase in efficiency. In other words, the savings rate increased and work hours were lengthened, and many more people, such as women, entered the work force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=Nov 1994|title=Paul Krugman |work=The Myth of Asia's Miracle |url=http://www.pkarchive.org/trade/myth.html |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrelevant citation|date=September 2018|reason=This article does not mention Taiwan}}

[[Dwight H. Perkins (economist)|Dwight Perkins]] and others cite certain methodological flaws in Krugman and Alwyn Young's research, and suggest that much of Taiwan's growth can be attributed to increases in productivity. These productivity boosts were achieved through land reform, structural change (urbanization and industrialization), and an economic policy of export promotion rather than import substitution.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Future growth==
Economic growth has become much more modest since the late 1990s. A key factor to understand this new environment is the rise of China, offering the same conditions that made possible, 40 years ago, the Taiwan Miracle (a quiet political and social environment, cheap and educated workers, absence of independent trade unions). To keep growing, the Taiwanese economy must abandon its workforce intensive industries, which cannot compete with [[China]], [[Vietnam]] or other sub-developed countries, and keep innovating and investing in [[information technology]]. Since the 1990s, Taiwanese companies have been permitted to invest in [[China]], and a growing number of Taiwanese businessmen are demanding easier communications between the two sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]].

One major difference with Taiwan is the focus on [[English language|English]] education. Mirroring [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]], the ultimate goal is to become a [[country]] fluent in three languages ([[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]]; [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], the national language of both the [[Communist Party of China|communist]] [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] and the [[Democratic Party (Taiwan)|Democratic]] [[industrialized]] [[Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan)]]; and [[English language|English]], becoming a bridge between East and West).

According to western financial markets, [[consolidation (business)|consolidation]] of the [[financial market|financial sector]] remains a concern as it continues at a slow pace, with the market split so small that no [[bank]] controls more than 10% of the market, and the Taiwanese government is obligated, by the [[WTO]] accession treaty, to open this sector between 2005 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/4-oa/wto/wto01.htm Trade and Investment Opportunities Presented by Taiwan's Accession to the World Trade Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many financial analysts estimate such concerns are based upon mirror-imaging of the Western model and do not take into account the already proven Asian Tiger model. Yet, recently, [[credit card debt]] has become a major problem, as the ROC does not have an individual [[bankruptcy]] law.  Taiwan also remains undeveloped in some sectors, such as the lack of a [[bond (finance)|bond]] market, a role that has been filled by small entrepreneur-oriented investment or direct investment by foreign persons.

Generally, [[transport]]ation [[infrastructure]] is very good and continues to be improved, mainly in the west side of the island.  Many infrastructure improvements are currently being pursued, such as the first [[rapid transit]] lines opening in Kaohsiung in 2008 and a doubling in size of Taipei's rapid transit system by 2013 now underway; the country's [[highways]] are very highly developed and in good maintenance and continue to be expanded, especially on the less developed and less populated east coast, and a controversial electronic [[toll road|toll]] system has recently been implemented.

The completion of the [[Taiwan High Speed Rail]] service connecting all major cities on the western coast, from [[Taipei]] to [[Kaohsiung]] is considered to be a major addition to Taiwan's transportation infrastructure. The ROC government has chosen to raise private financing in the building of these projects, going the build-operate-transfer route, but significant public financing has still been required and several [[scandal]]s have been uncovered.  Nevertheless, it is hoped that the completion of these projects will be a big economic stimulus, just as the subway in Taipei has revived the real estate market there.

=== Technology sector ===
Taiwan continues to rely heavily on its [[technology]] sector, a specialist in [[manufacturing]] [[outsourcing]]. Recent developments include moving up the [[food chain]] in [[brand]] building and design. [[LCD]] manufacturing and [[LED]] lights are two newer sectors in which Taiwanese companies are moving. Taiwan also wants to move into the [[biotechnology]] sector, the creation of [[fluorescent]] pet [[fish]] and a research-useful [[fluorescent pig]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hsiao | first1 = F.

Taiwan is also a leading grower of [[orchid]]s.

Taiwan’s information technology (IT) and electronics sector has been responsible for a vast supply of products since the 1980s. The [[Industrial Technology Research Institute]] (ITRI) was created in the 1973 to meet new demands from the burgeoning tech industry. This led to start-up companies like [[TSMC|Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company]] (TSMC) and the construction of the [[Hsinchu Science Park|Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park]] (HSP), which includes around 520 high-tech companies and 150,000 employees.&lt;ref name="投資組投資服務科"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sipa.gov.tw/english/home.jsp?serno=201003210015&amp;mserno=201003210003&amp;menudata=EnglishMenu&amp;contlink=content/introduction_2_1.jsp&amp;serno3=201003210021|title=Introduction|last=投資組投資服務科|date=2017-03-10|website=www.sipa.gov.tw|language=English|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, a bulk of the global market share of motherboards (89.9 percent), Cable CPE (84.5 percent), and Notebook PCs (83.5 percent) comprise both offshore and domestic production.

This is due to Taiwan’s unique trend of export-oriented small and medium enterprises (SME) – a direct result of domestic-market prioritization by state-owned enterprises (SOE) in its formative years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Political Explanation of Economic Growth|last=Wu|first=Yongping|publisher=Harvard University Asia Center|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the development of SMEs allowed better market adaptability and inter-firm partnerships, most companies in Taiwan remained original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and did not – other than firms like [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] and [[Asus]] – expand to original design manufacturing (OBM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CHEVALÉRIAS|first=PHILIPPE|date=2010|title=Taiwanese Economy After the Miracle: An Industry in Restructuration, StructuralWeaknesses and the Challenge of China|url=|journal=China Perspectives|volume=3|pages=40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These SMEs provide “incremental innovation” with regard to industrial manufacturing but do not, according to Dieter Ernst of the East-West Centre, a think-tank in Honolulu, surpass the “commodity trap,” which stifles investment in branding and R&amp;D projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16220584|title=Hybrid vigour: Taiwan’s tech firms are conquering the world—and turning Chinese|last=|first=|date=27 May 2010|work=The Economist|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the inauguration of the new Taiwanese president [[Tsai Ing-Wen]], the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) enacted policies building on the continued global influence of Taiwan’s IT industry. To revamp and reinvigorate Taiwan’s slowing economy, her “5+2” innovative industries initiative aims to boost key sectors such as biotech, sustainable energy, national defense, smart machinery, and the “Asian Silicon Valley” project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Taiwan and China: Fitful Embrace|last=Dittmer|first=Lowell|publisher=University of California Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=Oakland, California|pages=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Tsai herself was the chairperson for TaiMed Biologics, a state-led start-up company for biopharmaceutical development with Morris Chang, the CEO of TSMC, as an external adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Betting on Biotech: Innovation and the Limits of Asia's Developmental State|last=Wong|first=Joseph|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=U.S.A.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 November 2016, the Executive Yuan formally endorsed a biomedical promotion plan with a budget of NT$10.94 billion (US$346.32 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nspp.mofa.gov.tw/nsppe/content_tt.php?post=104459|title=Biomedical plan fast-tracks Taiwan for top spot in Asia - New Southbound Policy Portal|website=New Southbound Policy|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the opening ceremony for the Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency (ASVDA) in December 2016, Vice President Chen Chien-jen emphasized the increasing importance of enhancing not only local R&amp;D capabilities, but also appealing to foreign investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nspp.mofa.gov.tw/nsppe/content_tt.php?post=106453&amp;unit=346)|title=Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency launches in Taoyuan|last=|first=|date=Dec 27, 2016|website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the HSP now focuses 40 percent of its total workforce on “R&amp;D and technology development.”&lt;ref name="投資組投資服務科"/&gt; R&amp;D expenditures have been gradually increasing: In 2006, it amounted to NT$307 billion, but it increased to NT$483.5 billion (US$16 billion) in 2014, approximately 3 percent of the GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx?n=607ED34345641980&amp;sms=B8A915763E3684AC&amp;s=3CE82CC912356116|title=National Development Council-Taiwan Statistical Data Book|last=Council|first=National Development|date=2016-11-09|website=National Development Council|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018 profiled up to 140 countries, listing Taiwan as 16th place in university-industry collaboration in R&amp;D, 10th place in company spending on R&amp;D, and 22nd place in capacity for innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GCR2017-2018/05FullReport/TheGlobalCompetitivenessReport2017%E2%80%932018.pdf|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017–2018|last=Schwab|first=Klaus|date=|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approved overseas Chinese and foreign investment totaled US$11 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eng.dgbas.gov.tw/public/data/dgbas03/bs2/yearbook_eng/Yearbook2016.pdf|title=Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of China 2016|last=|first=|date=October 2017|website=Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, Republic of China|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016, a massive increase from US$4.8 billion in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eng.dgbas.gov.tw/public/data/dgbas03/bs2/yearbook_eng/Yearbook2016.pdf|title=Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of China 2016|last=|first=|date=October 2017|website=Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, Republic of China|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Investment Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs’ (MOEAIC) monthly report from October 2017 estimated a decline in total foreign direct investment (between January and October 2017) to US$5.5 billion, which is a 46.09 percent decrease from the same time period of 2016 (US$10.3 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moeaic.gov.tw/news.view?do=data&amp;id=1201&amp;lang=en&amp;type=new_ann)|title=INVESTMENT COMMISSION, MOEA -|website=www.moeaic.gov.tw|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cross-strait relations ===
Debate on opening "[[Three Links]]" with the [[People's Republic of China]] were completed in 2008, with the security risk of economic dependence on mainland China being the biggest barrier. By decreasing transportation costs, it was hoped that more money will be repatriated to Taiwan and that businesses will be able to keep operations centers in Taiwan while moving manufacturing and other facilities to mainland China.

A law forbidding any firm investing in the [[People's Republic of China]] more than 40% of its total assets on the mainland was dropped in June 2008, when the new [[KMT]] government relaxed the rules to invest in [[Mainland China]]. Dialogue through semi-official organisations (the SEF and the ARATS) reopened on 12 June 2008 on the basis of the 1992 Consensus, with the first meeting held in Beijing. Taiwan hopes to become a major operations center in East Asia.

=== Regional free trade agreements ===
While China already has international [[free trade agreement]]s (FTA) with numerous countries through bilateral relations and regional organizations, the “Beijing factor” has led to the deliberate isolation of Taiwan from potential FTAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=T.J.|date=July 2015|title=Global Opportunities, Local and Transnational Politics: Taiwan's Bid for FTAs|url=|journal=American Journal of Chinese Studies|volume=22|pages=145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In signing the [[Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement]] (ECFA) with China on 29 June 2010 – which permitted trade liberalization and an “early harvest” list of tariff cuts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncharted Strait: The Future of China-Taiwan Relations|last=Bush|first=Richard C.|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; – former president Ma Ying-jeou wanted to not only affirm a stable economic relationship with China, but also to assuage its antagonism towards Taiwan’s involvement in other FTAs.

[[File:Cordoba-teatrolibertador.JPG|thumb|240px|Libertador San Martín Theatre]]
[[File:Teatro Libertador, Córdoba (interior).jpg|thumb|240px|View of the concert hall]]
The '''Teatro del Libertador General San Martín''' (or more commonly, '''Teatro del Libertador''' or '''Teatro Libertador''') is the premier stage [[theatre]], [[opera house]] and [[concert hall]] in [[Córdoba, Argentina]].

==Overview==
Noting the absence of a concert hall in his native Córdoba, Provincial Justice Minister [[Ramón J. Cárcano]] proposed the establishment of one to Governor [[Ambrosio Olmos]] in 1887. Securing the project's approval and funding from the Córdoba Legislature, Cárcano commissioned a fellow [[Italian Argentine]], architect [[Francesco Tamburini]], for the project's design. Creating an eclectic [[Italianate]] theatre, Tamburini's design was juxtaposed with Arturo Nembrini Gonzaga's interior [[verdigris]] accents, façade [[reliefs]] and [[quadriga]], all nods to the [[Beaux Arts architecture]] so in demand in Argentina at the time. The entirety of the theatre's materials, fabrics and machinery was imported for the purpose from [[Europe]].

The landmark institution was inaugurated on April 26, 1891, as the Rivera Indarte Theatre. Popularly known as the ''Teatro de la Calle Ancha'' ("Broad Street Theatre") during the early 20th century (Broad Street was later renamed [[Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield|Vélez Sársfield]] Avenue), the grand concert hall was designed for a capacity of 1,000 spectators. Its concert hall featured a rising floor to stage level, made available during the many social balls held there since then. Among the first prominent drama theatre directors to stage productions there was [[María Guerrero]], who popularized the [[Spanish literature|theatre of Spain]] in Argentina after 1897. Subsequent years saw numerous internationally renowned classical performers, as well, notably [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Titta Ruffo]], [[Tito Schipa]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]].

The theatre additionally houses the Luis de Tejeda and Rafael Grisolía halls, each with capacities of around 100 and mainly reserved for seminars, as well as for the theatre's Youth Orchestra. A museum of the institution's extensive [[stagecraft]] collection was organized into the Cristóbal de Aguilar Musical and Theatre Museum in 1970.

The institution was renamed in honor of General [[José de San Martín]] in 1950 by order of President [[Juan Perón]] on the occasion of the centennial of the Liberator's death. It was renamed ''Rivera Indarte'' in 1956 (following Perón's overthrow), and regained the San Martín denomination in 1973.

'''''Videogame Nation''''' was a UK exhibition looking at the history of British videogames.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitnorthwest.com/blog/videogame-nation-urbis/ visitnorthwest.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930130937/http://www.visitnorthwest.com/blog/videogame-nation-urbis/ |date=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It showed how videogames have progressed over more than 30 years. Visitors were able to play a wide selection of games including [[Jet Set Willy]], [[Sensible Soccer]], [[Tomb Raider]] and [[Grand Theft Auto]]. The exhibition highlighted the key people and companies which have contributed to British gaming since its inception.

Curated by videogame journalist [[The Bolton News|''David Crookes'']],&lt;ref&gt;GamesTM [http://www.nowgamer.com/news/508/videogame-nation-interview] ''NowGamer'', Monday, 18 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Videogame Nation'' made its debut at the arts centre [[Urbis]] in [[Manchester]] on 14 May 2009. It ran until 19 September 2009. It visited Woodhorn Museum and Northumberland Archives, on the outskirts of Ashington in the North East of England, in February 2011 for seven months.

==Overview==
''Videogame Nation'' was split into a number of sections. It started in a bedroom setting, complete with a bed, showcasing games made by small teams, predominantly in the 1980s. It was possible to play [[Elite (video game)|Elite]], Jet Set Willy, [[Jetpac]] and ''[[Head over Heels (video game)|Head over Heels]]'', look at original posters, view a display cabinet packed with retro computer items and see the first issues of [[Crash magazine]]. The area explored the work of current retro programmer [[Jonathan Cauldwell]] as well as [[Introversion Software]], an indie developer which used to call itself the "Last of the Bedroom Programmers". Visitors were able to create their own pixel art.

Visitors were also able to play a range of driving games and discover more about their evolution. Games include [[Burnin' Rubber]] on the [[Amstrad GX4000]], [[Micro Machines]] on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Ferrari Challenge]] on a [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Burnout (series)|Burnout]] on a [[Xbox 360]].

An arcade section followed, looking at the popularity of arcades in the late 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. It concentrated on home computer versions of arcade classics including [[Ghouls 'n Ghosts]] and [[Pac-Man World 3]]. Two arcade cabinets for [[Rainbow Islands]] and Ghouls n Ghosts were provided by collector Jonathan Thompson and were the only parts of the exhibition which visitors had to pay extra to use.

An office setting allowed players to see how game development teams have increased in size. There was a display looking at the various jobs carried out by people working in gaming as well as examples of games produced in the late 1980s and 1990s. Among them were [[Broken Sword]], [[Theme Park]] and [[Dizzy (series)|Dizzy]]. This area also included a Dizzy map, a large display cabinet of original game development documents and posters. There was a particular emphasis on PC games among them [[Populous (video game)|Populous]].

A mocked-up stadium allowed gamers to play ''[[FIFA International Soccer]]'', ''[[Sensible Soccer]]'' and ''[[Kick Off (video game)|Kick Off]]'' while reclining in seats taken from [[Manchester City]]'s [[Maine Road]] stadium. Astroturf from Manchester City's training ground was also used. The sports section included [[Virtua Tennis]] and there was audio from [[Sensible Software]]'s [[Jon Hare]].

A section which looked at gaming on the go had an area dominated by a bus stop on to which [[PlayStation Portable]]s were attached. Bus seats opposite had [[Nintendo DS]]s attached. The idea was that games could be played anywhere and were not restricted to the home. There was an emphasis on exploration with titles from [[TTGames]]' [[LEGO]] series and there was a [[Star Wars]] [[Yoda]] created out of LEGO. [[Tomb Raider]] and [[WipEout]] were also playable and the area had a sofa and pixellated fire to show the transition from bedroom to living room. Three Elite spacecraft were placed on the wall in a similar manner to the flying ducks in [[Hilda Ogden]]'s house in [[Coronation Street]]. [[LostWinds]] was playable on a [[Nintendo Wii]].

A cinema allowed visitors to watch a selection of films including re-runs of [[GamesMaster]] and documentaries. There was an 18-rated section looking at [[Bully (video game)|Bully]] and [[Grand Theft Auto]]. This also explored controversies including the argument between [[Manchester Cathedral]] and [[Sony]] over the game [[Resistance: Fall of Man]].

One of the most popular sections allowed visitors to draw their own videogame covers. Many videogame developers including [[Blitz Games]]' [[Oliver Twins|Philip Oliver]] contributed.

==Events==
During its run at Urbis, ''Videogame Nation'' had a programme of events which ran throughout the Summer of 2009.

'''Voskhod&amp;nbsp;2''' ({{lang-ru|Восход-2||Sunrise-2}}) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] manned space mission in March 1965. The [[Vostok programme|Vostok]]-based [[Voskhod 3KD]] spacecraft with two crew members on board, [[Pavel Belyayev]] and [[Alexey Leonov]], was equipped with an inflatable airlock. It established another milestone in space exploration when Alexey Leonov became the first person to leave the spacecraft in a specialized spacesuit to conduct a 12-minute "[[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burgess|first1=Colin|last2=Hall|first2=Rex|title=The first Soviet cosmonaut team their lives, legacy, and historical impact|date=2009|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=038784824X|page=252|edition=Online-Ausg.|url=https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=rrdVPtCNL9AC&amp;pg=PA252#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grayzeck|first1=Dr. Edwin J.|title=Voskhod 2|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1965-022A|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|publisher=National Space Science Data Center|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liftoff took place at 11:00 AM on the morning of 18 March. As with Voskhod 1, a [[Launch escape system|launch abort]] was not possible during the first few minutes, until the [[Payload fairing|payload shroud]] jettisoned around the 2-1/2 minute mark.

[[Image:Voskhod spacecraft diagram.png|thumb|left|220x220px|Voskhod&amp;nbsp;2 spacecraft, with inflatable airlock deployed]]The Voskhod 3KD spacecraft had an inflatable [[airlock]] extended in orbit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spaceflight mission report: Voskhod 2|url = http://www.spacefacts.de/mission/english/voskhod-2.htm|website = www.spacefacts.de|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmonaut [[Alexey Leonov]] donned a [[space suit]] and left the spacecraft while the other cosmonaut of the two-man crew, [[Pavel Belyayev]], remained inside. Leonov began his spacewalk 90 minutes into the mission at the end of the first orbit. Cosmonaut Leonov's spacewalk lasted 12 minutes and 9 seconds (08:34:51–08:47:00hrs UTC), beginning over north-central Africa (northern Sudan/southern Egypt), and ending over eastern Siberia.

The Voskhod&amp;nbsp;2 spacecraft was a Vostok spacecraft with a backup, solid fuel [[retrorocket]], attached atop the descent module. The ejection seat was removed and two seats were added, (at a 90-degree angle relative to the Vostok crew seats position). An inflatable exterior airlock was also added to the descent module opposite the entry hatch. After use, the airlock was jettisoned. There was no provision for crew escape in the event of a launch or landing emergency. A solid fuel [[braking rocket]] was also added to the parachute lines to provide for a softer landing at touchdown. This was necessary because, unlike the Vostok, the crew landed with the Voskhod descent module.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Though Leonov was able to complete his spacewalk successfully, both that task and the overall mission were plagued with problems. Leonov's only tasks were to attach a camera to the end of the airlock to record his spacewalk and to photograph the spacecraft. He managed to attach the camera without any problem. However, when he tried to use the still camera on his chest, the suit had ballooned and he was unable to reach down to the shutter switch on his leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Rex|last2=Shayler|first2=David J.|title=The rocket men : Vostok &amp; Voskhod, the first Soviet manned spaceflights|date=2001|publisher=Springer [u.a.]|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-1852333911|page=246|url=https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=zndYLKa26wAC&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his 12&amp;nbsp;minutes and 9&amp;nbsp;seconds outside the Voskhod, Leonov found that his suit had stiffened, due to ballooning out, to the point where he could not re-enter the airlock. He was forced to bleed off some of his suit's pressure, in order to be able to bend the joints, eventually going below safety limits.{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|456}} Leonov did not report his action on the radio to avoid alarming others, but Soviet state radio and television had earlier stopped their live broadcasts from the spacecraft when the mission experienced difficulties. The two crew members subsequently experienced difficulty in sealing the hatch properly due to thermal distortion caused by Leonov's lengthy troubles returning to the craft, followed by a troublesome [[re-entry]] in which malfunction of the automatic landing system forced the use of its manual backup.&lt;ref name="leonov20050101"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/voskhod.html?c=y&amp;page=5 | title=The Nightmare of Voskhod 2 | work=Air &amp; Space | date=2005-01-01 | accessdate=April 15, 2011 | last=Leonov |first=Alexei | authorlink=Alexei Leonov |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft was so cramped that the two cosmonauts, both wearing spacesuits, could not return to their seats to restore the ship's [[center of mass]] for 46&amp;nbsp;seconds after orienting the ship for reentry{{r|siddiqi2000}}{{rp|457–459}} and a landing in [[Perm Krai]]. The orbital module did not properly disconnect from the landing module, not unlike [[Vostok 1]], causing the spherical return vehicle to spin wildly until the modules disconnected at 100&amp;nbsp;km.{{r|leonov20050101}}

[[File:TP-82.jpg|thumb|Triple-barreled [[TP-82 Cosmonaut survival pistol]] pistol in Saint-Petersburg Artillery museum]]

The delay of 46&amp;nbsp;seconds caused the spacecraft to land 386&amp;nbsp;km from the intended landing zone, in the inhospitable forests of [[Upper Kama Upland]], somewhere west of [[Solikamsk]]. Although flight controllers had no idea where the spacecraft had landed or whether Leonov and Belyayev had survived, the cosmonauts' families were told that they were resting after having been recovered. The two men were both familiar with the harsh climate and knew that bears and wolves, made aggressive by [[mating season]], lived in the ''[[taiga]]''; the spacecraft carried a pistol and "plenty of ammunition", but the incident later drove the development of a dedicated [[TP-82 Cosmonaut survival pistol]]. Although aircraft quickly located the cosmonauts, the area was so heavily forested that helicopters could not land. Night arrived, the temperature dropped to {{convert|-5|C|F|abbr=off}}, and the spacecraft's hatch had been blown open by [[explosive bolts]]. Warm clothes and supplies were dropped and the cosmonauts spent a freezing night in the capsule or ''Sharik'' in Russian. Even worse, the electrical system completely malfunctioned so that the heater would not work, but the fans ran at full blast. A rescue party arrived on skis the next day as it was too risky to try an airlift from the site.&lt;ref name="Springer u.a"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Rex|last2=Shayler|first2=David J.|title=The rocket men : Vostok &amp; Voskhod, the first Soviet manned spaceflights|date=2001|publisher=Springer [u.a.]|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-1852333911|page=250|url=https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=zndYLKa26wAC&amp;pg=PA250#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grahn|first1=Sven|title=The Voskhod 2 mission revisited|url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Voskhod2/Voskhod2.htm|website=SvenGrahn.pp.se|publisher=Sven Grahn|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advance party chopped wood and built a small log cabin and an enormous fire. After a more comfortable second night in the forest the cosmonauts skied to a waiting helicopter several kilometers away and flew first to Perm, then to [[Baikonur]] for their mission debriefing.&lt;ref name=siddiqi2000&gt;{{cite book | last = Siddiqi | first = Asif A | url = https://history.nasa.gov/printFriendly/series95.html | title = Challenge To Apollo: The Soviet Union and the Space Race, 1945–1974 | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|457–459}}{{r|leonov20050101}}

General [[Nikolai Kamanin]]'s diary later gave the landing location of the Voskhod 2, about {{convert|75|km|mi|abbr=off}} from Perm in the Ural mountains in heavy forest at 59:34 N 55:28 E on March 19, 1965 9:02 GMT. Initially there was some confusion and it was believed that Voskhod 2 landed not far from Shchuchin (about {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off}} south-west of Bereznikov, north of Perm), but no indication was received from the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wade|first1=Mark|title=Kamanin Diaries - 1965 March 19 - Landing of Voskhod 2|url=http://www.astronautix.com/articles/kamaries.htm|website=Astronautix.com|publisher=Mark Wade Astronautix.com|accessdate=20 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817172305/http://astronautix.com/articles/kamaries.htm|archivedate=17 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently a commander of one of the search helicopters reported finding Voskhod 2, "On the forest road between the villages of Sorokovaya and Shchuchino, about 30&amp;nbsp;kilometers southwest of the town of [[Berezniki]], I see the red parachute and the two cosmonauts. There is deep snow all around&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Springer u.a"/&gt;

The capsule is currently on display at the [[RKK Energiya museum|museum]] of [[RKK Energiya]] in [[Korolyov (city)|Korolev]], near Moscow.

==Spacewalk==
[[File:Voskhod 2 EVA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexey Leonov]] performs the first spacewalk during Voskhod&amp;nbsp;2]]

On reaching orbit in Voskhod&amp;nbsp;2, Leonov and Belyayev attached the EVA backpack to Leonov's [[Berkut spacesuit|Berkut (“Golden Eagle”) space suit]], a modified Vostok Sokol-1 intravehicular (IV) suit. The white metal EVA backpack provided 45 minutes of oxygen for breathing and cooling. Oxygen vented through a relief valve into space, carrying away heat, moisture, and exhaled carbon dioxide. The space suit pressure could be set at either {{convert|40.6|kPa|psi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|27.40|kPa|psi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="portree"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph7.pdf |title=Walking to Olympus: An EVA Chronology |accessdate=2008-01-05 |last=Portree |first=David S. F. |author2=Robert C. Treviño  |date=October 1997 |work=Monographs in Aerospace History Series #7 |publisher=NASA History Office |format=PDF |pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belyayev then deployed and pressurized the Volga inflatable airlock. The airlock was necessary for two reasons: first, the capsule's [[avionics]] used [[vacuum tube]]s, which required a constant atmosphere for air cooling. Also, supplies of nitrogen and oxygen sufficient to replenish the atmosphere after EVA could not be carried due to the spacecraft's weight limit. By contrast, the American [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] capsule used [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] avionics, and an atmosphere of oxygen only, at a low pressure of {{convert|10|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}, which could easily be replenished after EVA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Rex|last2=Shayler|first2=David J.|title=The Rocket Men: Vostok &amp; Voskhod, the First Soviet Manned Spaceflights|date=2001|publisher=Springer [u.a.]|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-1852333911|page=236|url=https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=zndYLKa26wAC&amp;pg=PA236#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Volga airlock was designed, built, and tested in nine months in mid-1964. At launch, Volga fitted over Voskhod&amp;nbsp;2's hatch, extending {{convert|74|cm|in|abbr=on}} beyond the spacecraft's hull. The airlock comprised a {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} wide metal ring fitted over Voskhod 2's inward-opening hatch, a double-walled fabric airlock tube with a deployed length of {{convert|2.50|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and a {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} wide metal upper ring around the {{convert|65|cm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}} wide inward-opening airlock hatch. Volga's deployed internal volume was {{convert|2.50|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}.

The fabric airlock tube was made rigid by about 40&amp;nbsp;airbooms, clustered as three, independent groups. Two groups sufficed for deployment. The airbooms needed seven minutes to fully inflate. Four spherical tanks held sufficient oxygen to inflate the airbooms and pressurize the airlock. Two lights lit the airlock interior, and three 16mm cameras&amp;nbsp;— two in the airlock, one outside on a boom mounted to the upper ring&amp;nbsp;— recorded the historic first spacewalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Rex|last2=Shayler|first2=David J.|title=The rocket men : Vostok &amp; Voskhod, the first Soviet manned spaceflights|date=2001|publisher=Springer [u.a.]|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-1852333911|page=240|url=https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=zndYLKa26wAC&amp;pg=PA240#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belyayev controlled the airlock from inside Voskhod&amp;nbsp;2, but a set of backup controls for Leonov was suspended on bungee cords inside the airlock. Leonov entered Volga, then Belyayev sealed Voskhod&amp;nbsp;2 behind him and depressurized the airlock. Leonov opened Volga's outer hatch and pushed out to the end of his {{convert|5.35|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} umbilicus. He later said the umbilicus gave him tight control of his movements&amp;nbsp;— an observation purportedly belied by subsequent American spacewalk experience. Leonov reported looking down and seeing from the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] to the [[Caspian Sea]].

After Leonov returned to his couch, Belyayev fired pyrotechnic bolts to discard the Volga. [[Sergei Korolev]], Chief Designer at OKB-1 Design Bureau (now [[RKK Energia]]), stated after the EVA that Leonov could have remained outside for much longer than he did, while [[Mstislav Keldysh]], “chief theoretician” of the Soviet space program and President of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]], said that the EVA showed that future cosmonauts would find work in space easy.

The government news agency, [[TASS (USSR)|TASS]], reported that, "outside the ship and after returning, Leonov feels well"; however, post-Cold War Russian documents reveal a different story&amp;nbsp;— that Leonov's Berkut space suit ballooned, making bending difficult. Because of this, Leonov was unable to reach the shutter switch on his thigh for his chest-mounted camera. He could not take pictures of Voskhod&amp;nbsp;2, but was able to recover the camera mounted on Volga which recorded his EVA for posterity but only after it stuck and he had to exert considerable effort to push it down in front of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Rex|last2=Shayler|first2=David J.|title=The rocket men : Vostok &amp; Voskhod, the first Soviet manned spaceflights|date=2001|publisher=Springer [u.a.]|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-1852333911|page=247|url=https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=zndYLKa26wAC&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 12&amp;nbsp;minutes walking in space Leonov re-entered Volga.

Later accounts report Cosmonaut Leonov violated procedure by entering the airlock head-first, then became stuck sideways when he turned to close the outer hatch, forcing him to flirt with [[decompression sickness]] (the “bends”) by lowering the suit pressure so he could bend to free himself. Leonov said that he had a [[suicide pill]] to swallow had he been unable to re-enter the Voskhod&amp;nbsp;2, and Belyayev been forced to abandon him in orbit.&lt;ref name="portree" /&gt;

Doctors reported that Leonov nearly suffered heatstroke&amp;nbsp;— his core body temperature increased by 1.8&amp;nbsp;°C (3.2&amp;nbsp;°F) in 20&amp;nbsp;minutes; Leonov said he was up to his knees in sweat, which sloshed in the suit. In an interview published in the Soviet Military Review in 1980, Leonov downplayed his difficulties, saying that "building manned orbital stations and exploring the Universe are inseparably linked with man's activity in open space. There is no end of work in this field."

==In popular culture==
* Part of the Voshkod 2 (identified as "Vostock 2") spacecraft is seen in the ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' episode "Conflict" as an abandoned space wreckage, before its destruction caused by a powerful International Astrophysical Commission bomb.
* In 2015, the mission was depicted in the "Space" episode of [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Drunk History]]'', created by [[Derek Waters]]. [[Blake Anderson]] and [[Adam DeVine]] played Leonov and Belyayev.
* The mission is depicted in the 2017 Russian film ''[[The Age of Pioneers]]'' ({{lang-ru|Время первых|Vremya Pervykh}}), also known as ''Spacewalk'', starring [[Yevgeny Mironov (actor)|Yevgeny Mironov]] as [[Alexey Leonov]] and [[Konstantin Khabensky]] as [[Pavel Belyayev]].

The current festival is named after the English [[Christian]] missionary [[Saint Walpurga]] ({{circa}} 710–777/9).

The Germanic term ''{{lang|de|Walpurgisnacht}}'' is recorded in 1668 by [[Johannes Praetorius (writer)|Johannes Praetorius]]&lt;ref name=praet&gt;{{cite book |last=Praetorius |first=Johannes |title=Blockes-Berges Verrichtung oder ausführlicher geographischer Bericht von den hohen trefflich alt- und berühmten Blockes-Berge: ingleichen von der Hexenfahrt und Zauber-Sabbathe, so auff solchen Berge die Unholden aus gantz Teutschland Jährlich den 1.

The 17th-century German tradition of a meeting of sorcerers and witches on May Day eve (''{{lang-de|Hexennacht}}'', ''{{lang-nl|Heksennacht}}'' "Witches' Night") is influenced by the descriptions of [[Witches' Sabbath]]s in 15th- and 16th-century literature.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Given that witches gathered on this Hexennacht, the [[Western Christian Church]] established the Feast of Saint Walpurga on the same night in order to counteract witchcraft, given that the intercession of Saint Walpurga was efficacious against evil magic.&lt;ref name="Canaday2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapru1977"/&gt; Across Christendom, people continue to light bonfires on Saint Walpurga's Eve, now dedicated to this Christian saint, in order to ward off [[unclean spirit|evil spirits]] and [[Christian views on witchcraft|witches]].&lt;ref name="Galván2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stark1998"/&gt; Many Christians also make [[Christian pilgrimage|religious pilgrimages]] to Saint Walburga's tomb in [[Eichstätt]] on Saint Walburga's Day; in the 19th century, the number of pilgrims travelling to the Church of St. Walpurgis was described as "many thousand".&lt;ref name="Murray1843"/&gt;

30 April is ''{{lang|cs|Pálení čarodějnic}}'' ("Burning of the witches") or ''{{lang|cs|čarodějnice}}'' ("The witches") in the [[Czech Republic]]. Huge bonfires up to {{convert|8|m}} tall with a witch figure are built and burnt in the evening, preferably on top of hills. Young people gather around. Sudden black and dense smoke formations are cheered as "a witch flying away". An effigy of a witch is held up and thrown into a bonfire to burn.&lt;ref name="2014Galván"&gt;{{cite book|last=Galván|first=Javier A.|title=They Do What?

It is still a widespread feast in the Czech Republic, practiced since the pagan times. The feast is sometimes associated with [[Slavic paganism|Slavic goddess]] [[Marzanna]], which represents winter and death.

As evening advances to midnight and fire is on the wane, it is time to go search for a cherry tree in blossom. This is another feast, connected with the 1st May. Young women should be kissed past midnight (and during the following day) under a cherry tree. They "will not dry up" for an entire year. The First of May is celebrated then as "the day of those in love".

=== Estonia ===

In [[Estonia]], ''{{lang|et|Volbriöö}}'' is celebrated throughout the night of 30 April and into the early hours of 1 May, where 1 May is a public holiday called "Spring Day" (''{{lang|et|Kevadpüha}}''). Volbriöö is an important and widespread celebration of the arrival of spring in the country. Influenced by German culture, the night originally stood for the gathering and meeting of witches. Modern people still dress up as witches to wander the streets in a carnival-like mood.

The Volbriöö celebrations are especially vigorous in [[Tartu]], the university town in southern Estonia. For Estonian students in student corporations (fraternities and sororities), the night starts with a traditional procession through the streets of Tartu, followed by visiting each other's corporation houses throughout the night.

[[File:Kaivopuisto Vappu picnic 2008.jpg|thumb|People at a Vappu picnic in [[Kaivopuisto]] in 2008]]

In [[Finland]], Walpurgis night (''{{lang|fi|Vappu}}'') ("{{lang|sv|Vappen}}") is one of the four biggest holidays along with Christmas Eve, [[New Year's Eve]], and [[Midsummer]] (''{{lang|fi|Juhannus - Midsommar}}'').&lt;ref name="Williams2016"/&gt; Walpurgis witnesses the biggest [[carnival]]-style festival held in Finland's cities and towns. The celebration, which begins on the evening of 30 April and continue on 1 May, typically centre on the consumption of [[Sima (mead)|sima]], [[sparkling wine]] and other [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Student traditions, particularly those of engineering students, are one of the main characteristics of ''{{lang|fi|Vappu}}''. Since the end of the 19th century, this traditional upper-class feast has been appropriated by university students. Many ''{{lang|fi|[[gymnasium (school)|lukio]]}}'' (university-preparatory high school) alumni wear the black and white [[student cap]] and many higher education students wear [[Student boilersuit|student coveralls]]. One tradition is to drink [[sima (mead)|sima]], a home-made low-alcohol [[mead]], along with freshly cooked tippaleipä, [[funnel cakes]] in English.

In the capital, [[Helsinki]], and its [[Greater Helsinki|surrounding region]], fixtures include the capping (on 30 April at 6 pm) of [[Havis Amanda]], a nude female statue in [[Helsinki]], and the biennially alternating publications of ribald matter called ''{{lang|fi|[[Äpy]]}}'' and ''{{lang|fi|[[Julkku]]}}'', by engineering students of [[Aalto University]]. Both are [[sophomoric]]; but while ''{{lang|fi|Julkku}}'' is a standard [[magazine]], ''{{lang|fi|Äpy}}'' is always a gimmick. Classic forms have included an ''{{lang|fi|Äpy}}'' printed on [[toilet paper]] and a [[bedsheet]]. Often, Äpy has been stuffed inside standard industrial packages, such as sardine cans and milk cartons. For most university students, ''{{lang|fi|Vappu}}'' starts a week before the day of celebration. The festivities also include a picnic on 1 May, which is sometimes prepared in a lavish manner, particularly in Ullanlinnanmäki in central Helsinki.
In [[Turku]], it has become a tradition to cap the Posankka statue.

''Vappu'' coincides with the socialist [[May Day]] parade. Expanding from the parties of the left, the whole of the [[Politics of Finland|Finnish political scene]] has adopted ''{{lang|fi|Vappu}}'' as the day to go out on stumps and agitate. This isn’t limited only to political activists; many institutions, such as the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Lutheran Church of Finland]], have followed suit, marching and making speeches. Left-wing activists of the 1970s still party on May Day. Carnivals are arranged, and many radio stations play leftist songs, such as [[The Internationale]].

Traditionally, 1 May is celebrated by the way of a picnic in a park. For most, the picnic is enjoyed with friends on a blanket with food and [[sparkling wine]]. Some people arrange extremely lavish picnics with pavilions, white tablecloths, silver [[candelabra]]s, [[european classical music|classical music]] and extravagant food. The picnic usually starts early in the morning, where some of the previous night's party-goers continue their celebrations from the previous night.

Some student organisations reserve areas where they traditionally camp every year. [[Student cap]]s, [[mead]], streamers and balloons have their role in the picnic and the celebration as a whole.

On the Feast of Saint Walburga, "many thousand" people have made [[Christian pilgrimage]]s to Saint Walburga's tomb in [[Eichstätt]] on the Feast of Saint Walburga, often obtaining vials of [[Oil of Saints|Saint Walburga's oil]].&lt;ref name="Murray1843"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wunderli1992"/&gt;

In Germany, ''{{lang|de|Hexennacht}}'' ("Witches' Night"), the night from 30 April to 1 May, is the night when [[witch]]es are reputed to hold a large celebration on the [[Brocken]] and await the arrival of spring and is held on the same night as Saint Walpurgis Night (''{{lang|de|Sankt Walpurgisnacht}}'').

{{quote|Walpurgisnacht Night (in German folklore) the night of 30 April (May Day's eve), when witches meet on the [[Brocken]] mountain and hold revels with the Devil...

Brocken is the highest of the Harz Mountains of north central Germany. It is noted for the phenomenon of the [[Brocken spectre]] and for witches' revels which reputedly took place there on Walpurgis night.

The Brocken Spectre is a magnified shadow of an observer, typically surrounded by rainbow-like bands, thrown onto a bank of cloud in high mountain areas when the sun is low. The phenomenon was first reported on the Brocken.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford]] Phrase &amp; Fable.&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete short citation|date=October 2018}}}}

A scene in [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Faust, Part 1|Faust Part One]]'' is called "{{lang|de|Walpurgisnacht}}," and one in ''[[Faust, Part 2|Faust Part Two]]'' is called "Classical {{lang|de|Walpurgisnacht}}."  The last chapter of book five in [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'' is also called "{{lang|de|Walpurgisnacht}}."  In [[Edward Albee]]'s 1962 play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]],'' Act Two is entitled "{{lang|de|Walpurgisnacht}}."

From [[Bram Stoker]]'s short story, ''[[Dracula's Guest]]'', an Englishman (whose name is never mentioned) is on a visit to [[Munich]] before leaving for Transylvania. It is Walpurgis Night, and in spite of the hotelier's warning not to be late coming back, the young man later leaves his carriage and wanders toward the direction of an abandoned "unholy" village. As the carriage departs with the frightened and superstitious driver, a tall and thin stranger scares the horses at the crest of a hill.

In some parts of northern coastal regions of Germany, the custom of lighting huge fires is still kept alive to celebrate the coming of May, while most parts of Germany have a derived Christianized custom around Easter called "Easter fires" (''{{lang|de|Osterfeuer}}'').

In rural parts of southern Germany, it is part of popular youth culture to play pranks such as tampering with neighbours' gardens, hiding possessions, or spraying graffiti on private property.

In [[Berlin]], traditional [[Leftism|leftist]] May Day riots usually start at Walpurgis Night in the {{lang|de|[[Mauerpark]]}} in {{lang|de|[[Prenzlauer Berg]]}}. There is a similar tradition in the {{lang|de|Schanzenviertel}} district of [[Hamburg]], though in both cases, the situation has significantly calmed down in the past few years.

Walpurgis celebrations are not a family occasion but rather a public event, and local groups often take responsibility for organising them to encourage community spirit in the village or neighbourhood. Celebrations normally include lighting the bonfire, choral singing and a speech to honour the arrival of the spring season, often held by a local celebrity.

[[File:Valborgsbrasa-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Walpurgis Night [[bonfire]] in [[Sweden]]]]
In the Middle Ages, the administrative year ended on 30 April. Accordingly, this was a day of festivity among the merchants and craftsmen of the town, with trick-or-treat, dancing and singing in preparation for the forthcoming celebration of spring. Sir [[James George Frazer]] in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' writes, "The first of May is a great popular festival in the more midland and southern parts of Sweden. On the eve of the festival, huge bonfires, which should be lighted by striking two flints together, blaze on all the hills and knolls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frazer |first=James G. |title=The New Golden Bough |publisher=Anchor Books |year=1961 |page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walpurgis bonfires are part of a Swedish tradition dating back to the early 18th century. At Walpurgis (''{{lang|sv|Valborg}}''), farm animals were let out to graze and bonfires (''{{lang|sv|majbrasor}}'', ''{{lang|sv|kasar}}'') lit to scare away predators. In [[Götaland|Southern Sweden]], an older tradition, no longer practiced, was for the younger people to collect greenery and branches from the woods at twilight. These were used to adorn the houses of the village. The expected reward for this task was to be paid in [[egg (food)|eggs]].

Choral singing is a popular pastime in Sweden, and on Walpurgis Eve virtually every choir in the country is busy. Singing traditional songs of spring is widespread throughout the country. The songs are mostly from the 19th century and were spread by students' spring festivities. The strongest and most traditional spring festivities are also found in the old university cities, such as [[Uppsala]] and [[Lund]], where undergraduates, graduates, and alumni gather at events that last most of the day from early morning to late night on April 30, or ''{{lang|sv|siste april}}'' ("The Last Day of April") as it is called in Lund, or ''{{lang|sv|sista april}}'' as it is called in Uppsala. For students, Walpurgis Eve heralds freedom. Traditionally the exams were over and only the odd lecture remained before term ends. On the last day of April, the students don their characteristic white caps and sing songs of welcome to spring, to the budding greenery and to a brighter future.

More modern Valborg celebrations, particularly among Uppsala students, often consist of enjoying a breakfast including champagne and strawberries. During the day, people gather in parks, drink considerable amounts of alcoholic beverages, barbecue, and generally enjoy the weather, if it happens to be favorable.

In Uppsala, since 1975, students honor spring by rafting on {{lang|sv|[[Fyrisån]]}} through the center of town with rickety, homemade, in fact quite easily wreckable, and often humorously decorated rafts.
Several [[nation (university)|nations]] also hold "Champagne Races" ({{lang-sv|Champagnegalopp}}), where students go to drink and spray champagne or somewhat more modestly priced sparkling wine on each other. The walls and floors of the old nation buildings are covered in plastic for this occasion, as the champagne is poured around recklessly and sometimes spilled enough to wade in. Spraying champagne is, however, a fairly recent addition to the Champagne Race. The name derives from the students running down the downhill slope from the [[Carolina Rediviva]] library, toward the Student Nations, to drink champagne.

In {{lang|sv|[[Linköping]]}} many students and former students begin the day at the park {{lang|sv|[[Trädgårdsföreningen, Linköping|Trädgårdföreningen]]}}, in the field below [[Belvederen]] where the city laws permits alcohol, to drink champagne breakfast in a similar way to Uppsala. Later at 15:00 o'clock the students and public gather at the courtyard of [[Linköping Castle]]. Spring songs are sung by the [[Linköping University Male Voice Choir]], and speeches are made by representatives of the students and the university professors.

In [[Gothenburg]], the carnival parade, [[The Cortège]], which has been held since 1909 by the students at [[Chalmers University of Technology]], is an important part of the celebration. It is seen by around 250,000 people each year. Another major event is the gathering of students in {{lang|sv|[[Trädgårdsföreningen]]}} to listen to student choirs, orchestras, and speeches. An important part of the gathering is the ceremonial donning of the student cap, which stems from the time when students wore their caps daily and switched from black winter cap to white summer cap.

In {{lang|sv|[[Umeå]]}}, there is a tradition of having local bonfires. During recent years, however, there has been a tradition of celebrating Walpurgis at the [[Umeå University]] campus. The university organizes student choir songs, there are different types of entertainment and a speech by the president of the university. Different stalls sell hot dogs, candies, soft drinks, etc.

=== The Netherlands ===
[[File:Mensen bekijken paasvuur in Eibergen.jpg|thumb|Walpurgis night bonfires]]

As in all Germanic countries, ''{{lang|de|Walpurgisnacht}}'' was celebrated in areas of what is now the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/archief/article/detail/1778613/2003/04/19/Pasen-in-het-Finkersgebergte.dhtml |title=Pasen in het Finkersgebergte |last=Hielkema |first=Haro |date=19 April 2003 |work=[[Trouw]] |language=Dutch |accessdate=8 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has not been celebrated recently due to the national ''{{lang|nl|[[Koninginnedag]]}}'' (Queen's Day) falling on the same date, though the new ''{{lang|nl|koningsdag}}'' (King's Day) is on 27 April. The island of [[Texel]] celebrates a festival known as the '{{Interlanguage link multi|Meierblis|nl}}' (roughly translated as 'May-Blaze') on that same day, where bonfires are lit near nightfall, just as on Walpurgis, but with the meaning to drive away the remaining cold of winter and welcome spring. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Occasional mentions to the ritual occur, and at least once a feminist group co-opted the name to call for attention to the position of women (following the example of German women's organizations&lt;ref name="Ferree2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferree |first=Myra |title=Varieties of Feminism: German Gender Politics in Global Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNZiDYlOUeYC&amp;pg=PA90 |year=2012 |publisher=Stanford UP |isbn=9780804757607 |page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), a variety of the [[Take Back the Night (organization)|Take Back the Night]] phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roggeband |first=Cornelia Maria |title=Over de grenzen van de politiek: een vergelijkende studie naar de opkomst en ontwikkeling van de vrouwenbeweging tegen seksueel geweld in Nederland en Spanje|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FlY6u_5WSCsC&amp;pg=PA172 |year=2002 |publisher=Van Gorcum |language=Dutch |isbn=9789023238300 |page=172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, in recent years a renewed interest in pre-Christian religion and culture has led to renewed interest in Heksennacht (Witch's Night) as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.frieschdagblad.nl/index.asp?artid=14728 |title=Theoloog Henk Vreekamp: ik ben een heiden; 'Kerk moet terug naar heidense wortels'|date=27 September 2003 |work=[[Friesch Dagblad]] |language=Dutch |accessdate=8 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, suspicions were raised among local [[Reformed Political Party|Reformed party]] members in [[Putten]], [[Gelderland]] of a Heksennacht festival celebrated by [[Satanist]]s. The party called for a ban. That such a festival even existed, however, and that it was 'Satanic' was rejected by most others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.verhalenbank.nl/items/show/30204 |title=RPF/GPV staat alleen in geloof in heksenfeest|date=23 June 1999 |work=[[Utrechts Nieuwsblad]] |language=Dutch |accessdate=8 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The local Church in [[Dokkum]], [[Friesland]] organized a Service in 2003 to pray for the [[Holy Spirit]] to, according to the church, counter the Satanic action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvnof.nl/?page=1&amp;id=363?page=1&amp;id=363 |title=Rennie Schoorstra te gast in Geloven en Beleven |date=2 January 2003 |publisher=[[RTV Noordoost Friesland]] |language=Dutch |accessdate=8 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
In [[Lincolnshire]] Walpurgis Night was observed in rural communities until the second half of the 20th century, with a tradition of hanging [[Primula veris|cowslips]] to ward off evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The other Halloween is coming up and it has history here|url=https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/nostalgia/halloween-coming-up-walpurgis-night-1510490|accessdate=30 April 2018|work=grimsbytelegraph|date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Wendell Gee'''" is a song by the American [[alternative rock]] band [[R.E.M.]], released as the third and final [[Single (music)|single]] from the group's third studio album ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'' in 1985. It was released in [[Europe]] only, in two [[Gramophone record|7"]] and two [[12-inch single|12"]] formats.

Instrumentally, the song was almost entirely composed and performed by [[Mike Mills]], with [[Michael Stipe]] supplying the lyric and vocal. (Mills' backing vocal is ''"Gonna miss you, boy"''.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/m_millsey/status/557311649200496641 "Mills' explanation on Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Buck]] hated the song when it was initially recorded, claiming its only redeeming feature was his [[banjo]] solo, and it was only included on the album at the last minute. With Buck's objections being such, the song was very rarely played live, even on the European leg of the Reconstruction tour where it had been released as a single. Buck has since revised his view of the song, saying "I must admit, I was wrong. I don't love it, but I like it." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The subject of the song died just after R.E.M. completed their 1995 world tour in support of the previous year's ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]''. He was 69.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Athens Banner-Herald]]'', November 26, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svs.com/rem/other/real_people.faq&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Scrabble Championship 2007''' was held in the [http://www.tajhotels.com/Business/Taj%20President%20Hotel,MUMBAI/ Taj President Hotel], [[Mumbai]], India between 9 November and 12 November. The winner was [[Nigel Richards (Scrabble)|Nigel Richards]] of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=wsc2007&gt;http://www.wscgames.com/2007/prizes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The tournament began with a 24-round [[Swiss tournament]], whose top two players contested a best-of-five final.

==Results==
The preliminary stage involved 104 players, the largest number of players in WSC history, over 24 rounds, using the "[[Swiss_draw#Scrabble|Chew Pairing]]" system to select the draw for each round.

Nigel Richards beat [[Ganesh Asirvatham]] of [[Malaysia]] 3-0 in the final. This was the first time either of them had reached the final. Ganesh was the number 1 rated player in the world at the time, and Nigel the form player had always been knocking on the door in majors and was a multiple winner of the [[Brand's Crossword Game King's Cup]] including 2007.

Nigel won the first game 412-316.&lt;ref name=game1&gt;http://www.wscgames.com/cgi-bin/showgcg.cgi?id=/2007/f1;turn=0&lt;/ref&gt; He [[bingo (Scrabble)|bingoed]] [[wikt:varsity|VARSITy]]; Ganesh bingoed [[wikt:seringa|sERINGA]]. Nigel's [http://www.wscgames.com/cgi-bin/showgcg.cgi?id=/2007/f1;turn=1 opening play] was [[wikt:gavot|GAVOT]] with the '''V''' on the centre star. During the game Ganesh [http://www.wscgames.com/cgi-bin/showgcg.cgi?id=/2007/f1;turn=10 missed the bingo] [[wikt:outcrawl|OUTCRAWL]].

Nigel won the second game 400-371.&lt;ref name=game2&gt;http://www.wscgames.com/cgi-bin/showgcg.cgi?id=/2007/f2;turn=0&lt;/ref&gt; Ganesh took an early lead with [[wikt:aether|AETHERS]] but had to exchange tiles twice, and although he caught up again with ANTIENTS and a late-game bingo [[wikt:duplied|DUPLiED]], and Nigel only bingoed once with [[wikt:odonate|ODONAtE]], Nigel won on the strength of the value he got out of the J, Q and X with [[wikt:jerbil|JERBIL]], [[wikt:quohog|QUOHOG]] and FAX.

Nigel wins the third game 499-470&lt;ref name=game3&gt;http://www.wscgames.com/cgi-bin/showgcg.cgi?id=/2007/f3;turn=0&lt;/ref&gt; and becomes New Zealand's first world champion. This game was a bingo-fest with Nigel's [[wikt:recopy|RECOPIES]], [[wikt:equinias|EQuINIAS]] and OVERAPT to Ganesh's [[wikt:treck|TRECKING]], [[wikt:adnation|ADNATION]], DIrTIEST and a [[Scrabble#Scoring|triple-triple]] [[wikt:tailleur|TAILLEUR]].  However, once again, Nigel's luck with drawing the high scoring letters saw him have the edge in a fitting finale.

'''Wyndham's Theatre''' is a [[West End theatre]], one of two opened by actor/manager [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]] (the other is the [[Criterion Theatre]]). Located on [[Charing Cross Road]] in the [[City of Westminster]], it was designed c.1898 by [[W.G.R. Sprague]], the architect of six other London theatres between then and 1916.  It was designed to seat 759 patrons on three levels; later refurbishment increased this to four seating levels. The theatre was [[listed building|Grade II*]] listed by [[English Heritage]] in September 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|209091 |date= |accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Wyndham had always dreamed of building a theatre of his own, and through the admiration of a patron and the financial confidence of friends, he was able to realise his dream. Wyndham's Theatre opened on 16 November 1899, in the presence of the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]]. The first play performed there was a revival of [[Thomas William Robertson|T. W. Robertson]]'s ''[[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]]''.

In 1910, [[Gerald du Maurier]] began an association with the theatre which lasted 15 years and to include the stage debut of the screen actress [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. Du Maurier's small daughter, [[Daphne du Maurier|Daphne]], often watched her father's performance from the wings. Thirty years later she presented her own play, ''[[The Years Between (Daphne du Maurier play)|The Years Between]]'', on the same stage.

In April 1953 the theatre premiered [[Graham Greene]]'s first play, ''[[The Living Room (play)|The Living Room]]'', with a cast including [[Dorothy Tutin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Samantha Ellis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/nov/12/theatre.grahamgreene |title=The Living Room, London, April 1953 &amp;#124; Stage |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1954, a small-scale musical pastiche, [[Sandy Wilson]]'s ''[[The Boy Friend (musical)|The Boy Friend]]'', which had premiered at the much smaller [[Players' Theatre]], was moved to the Wyndham stage. It ran for 2,078 performances, before eventually transferring to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. During the 60s and early 70s, the theatre continued to provide a setting for stars such as [[Alec Guinness]] (''[[Wise Child]]''), [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and [[Diana Rigg]].

The blockbuster of the 1970s decade – ''[[Godspell]]'' –  opened at Wyndham's in January 1972 and ran to October 1974. The original cast included [[David Essex]], [[Marti Webb]] and [[Jeremy Irons]]. 
[[File:Wyndhams Theatre 1900.jpg|thumb|250px|Wyndham's Theatre just before its opening on 16 November 1900.]]

Among more recent distinguished productions were the world premiere of ''[[The Ride Down Mt. Morgan]]'' by American playwright [[Arthur Miller]] and the British premiere of [[Edward Albee|Edward Albee's]] ''[[Three Tall Women]]'', starring [[Maggie Smith]]. Twenty-five years after making her debut there, Diana Rigg returned to play a hugely successful season as [[Medea (play)|Medea]]. The critically acclaimed comedy, ''[['Art' (play)|'Art']]'', by [[Yasmina Reza]], began its record-breaking run at Wyndham's in 1996 with [[Albert Finney]], [[Tom Courtenay]] and [[Ken Stott]] in the cast. It opened in October 1996, and transferred to the [[Whitehall Theatre]] in October 2001.

[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] made her West End debut there in 2002, performing in a sell-out production of ''Up For Grabs''.  This was followed by many other dramatic productions, including ''Dinner'' and the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]]'s ''[[Democracy (play)|Democracy]]'' during 2004, [[Holly Hunter]] in ''By The Bog Of Cats'', American TV star [[Ruby Wax]] in a children's stage version of ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'', which ran during March 2005; followed by a controversial limited season of [[Eve Ensler]]'s ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', which ran without the stars – [[Sharon Osbourne]] and her daughter Aimee, who dropped out the night before the production opened.  Since then, theatre patrons have seen [[Sienna Miller]] star alongside [[Helen McCrory]], [[Reece Shearsmith]] and [[Clive Rowe]] in a new production of Shakespeare's ''[[As You Like It]]''.

A large-scale replica of the facade of the theatre was constructed at the [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] theme park in [[Orlando, Florida]] as part of the park's London-themed area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201402/3894/ |title=On the Road to Diagon Alley: The London Embankment |website=Themeparkinsider.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delfont Mackintosh era==
In May 2005, the theatre was taken over by [[Cameron Mackintosh]]'s Delfont-Mackintosh Ltd., which began operations of the venue in September 2005. In October 2005 the theatre presented [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''Heroes'', a translation of the French play ''Le vent des peupliers'' by [[Gérald Sibleyras]], which starred [[Richard Griffiths]] and [[John Hurt]].&lt;ref&gt;Aleks Sierz, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/3647137/Sir-Tom-in-the-doghouse.html "Sir Tom in the doghouse"], ''The Telegraph'', 10 October 2005. Retrieved 2012-12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year the theatre hosted a new production of [[Joanna Murray-Smith]]'s play ''[[Honour (Murray-Smith play)|Honour]]'' starring Diana Rigg, [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] and [[Natascha McElhone]], which ran between 7 February and 6 May 2006.  It later hosted the West End transfer of the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]]'s hit production of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s musical ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'', which starred Daniel Evans and [[Jenna Russell]] and ran till September. Between December 2006 and April 2007, the theatre presented the West End commercial transfer of [[Alan Bennett]]'s National Theatre hit ''[[The History Boys]]'' which played to sell-out houses during its run until April 2007.

[[Bill Kenwright]]'s production of [[W. Somerset Maugham|Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[The Letter (play)|The Letter]]'' played through summer 2007. There was a short hiatus after [[Chita Rivera]] was forced to postpone a scheduled London return.  ''Shadowlands'', based on the life story of [[C.S. Lewis]] opened in October 2007, starring [[Charles Dance]] and [[Janie Dee]], before another return of [[Alan Bennett]]'s ''[[The History Boys]]'' from December 2007.

The theatre closed temporarily for refurbishment works, before reopening in September 2008 with [[Kenneth Branagh]] starring in [[Michael Grandage]]'s production of [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]''. This new version by [[Tom Stoppard]] was the opening play in the [[Donmar Warehouse|Donmar West End]] twelve-month season at Wyndham's, with tickets at Donmar Warehouse prices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080919124058/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/shenton/2008/09/patron-saint-of-ladies-loos/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Donmar West End season also included  [[Derek Jacobi]] starring in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', Judi Dench in [[Yukio Mishima]]'s ''[[Madame de Sade]]'', and [[Jude Law]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'', all staged by Grandage.

The '''YOGTZE case''' ({{lang-de|YOGTZE-Fall}}, also '''''BAB-Rätsel''''', "[[Autobahn]] Riddle") refers to the death of unemployed German food engineer Günther Stoll, which occurred on 26 October 1984. 

It is one of the most mysterious unsolved cases in German criminal history. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Background ==

In 1984, Günther Stoll, an unemployed food engineer from {{ill|Anzhausen|de}}, was suffering from a moderate case of [[paranoia]]. Prior to his death, he occasionally spoke to his wife of "them," unknown people who supposedly intended to harm him. He mentioned "them," specifically, on the evening of 25 October 1984 (at approximately 23:00), before suddenly shouting "Jetzt geht mir ein Licht auf!" ("Now I've got it!"). He then wrote the six letters "YOG'TZE" (it is not conclusive if the third letter was intended to represent a '6' or a 'G') on a sheet of paper before instantly crossing them out.

Shortly thereafter, Stoll went to his favorite pub in [[Wilnsdorf]], where he ordered a beer and fell on the ground, injuring his face. Witnesses stated that he was not under the influence of alcohol and that he suddenly lost consciousness.

He awoke and drove away in his [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|VW Golf I]]. It is not known what he did in the next two hours. At around 01:00 on 26 October 1984, he went to {{ill|Haigerseelbach|de|Seelbach (Haiger)}}, where he grew up. There, he talked to a woman he knew from his childhood and mentioned a "horrible incident." Since it was so late at night, the woman advised him to go to his parents' place, and talk to them instead. He then left.

== Discovery ==

At approximately 3:00am, two truck drivers discovered Stoll's crashed vehicle in a trench adjacent to the [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]], near the [[Hagen|Hagen-Süd]] exit, {{convert|100|km|-1}} from Haigerseelbach.

Both truck drivers testified to having seen an injured person in a white jacket walking near the car. After calling law enforcement, the drivers found the severely injured Günther Stoll naked in his car. He was conscious and mentioned four male persons who had been with him in the car, and had run away. When asked if the men were his friends, Stoll denied it. He died on the way to hospital.

== The investigation ==

The criminal investigation showed that Stoll was injured before the crash, and must have been hit by a car elsewhere, and subsequently positioned in the passenger's seat of his car and driven to the location where he was discovered.

It was also concluded that he was naked at the time he was run over. Other drivers reported seeing a hitchhiker at the Hagen-Süd exit. Neither the hitchhiker nor the person in the white jacket were identified. Suspicions regarding Stoll's holiday trips to the [[Netherlands]], where he was thought to have made contact with drug dealers, proved unfounded.

The meaning of the letters "YOG'TZE" remains unknown, however, some{{who|date=March 2017}} suggest it may be properly read upside-down.

== Television coverage ==
On 12 April 1985, the case was presented on the popular German television program ''[[Aktenzeichen XY … ungelöst]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzx4Zicfmus |title=Aktenzeichen XY YOGTZE BAB RÄTSEL Mord an Günther Stoll 12.04.1985 |website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
