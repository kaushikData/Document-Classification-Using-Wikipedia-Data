== Abortion care for refugees and asylum seekers ==

=== African refugee S99 ===
In 2016, a young African [[refugee]] in Nauru, identified in the courts only as "S99," was [[rape]]d while semi-conscious during an [[epileptic seizure]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/refugee-battles-for-abortion-after-rape-on-nauru-20160414-go67o6.html|title=First she was raped on Nauru.

=== Proposed abortion laws ===
In November 2016, Nauru's Border Protection Minister [[David Adeang]] introduced a bill to allow abortion services for refugees and asylum seekers, rather than sending them to Papua New Guinea or Australia.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-11/nauru-scraps-abortion-laws-for-refugees-asylum-seekers/8018504|title=Nauru scraps proposed abortion laws for refugees and asylum seekers|date=2016-11-11|newspaper=ABC News|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was opposed by members of [[Parliament of Nauru|Parliament]] on both sides of the aisle.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Critics of the bill cite the Nauruan community's staunch [[Christianity]] as one reason for opposition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Symptom Checklist''' is a self-reported [[questionnaire]] used to assist in the diagnosis of adult [[ADHD]]. The [[PhenX Toolkit]] uses ASRS as its adult protocol for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Protocol Overview: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms - Adult |website=PhenX Toolkit, Ver 19.0 |date=17 January 2017 |publisher=RTI International |url=https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/index.php?pageLink=browse.protocoldetails&amp;id=121501 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The ASRS was developed in conjunction with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), and the Workgroup on Adult [[ADHD]] which included researchers from [[New York University School of Medicine|New York University Medical School]] and [[Harvard Medical School]]. The ASRS has eighteen questions, which are consistent with the [[DSM-IV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., Text Revision
|location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |date=2000 |pages=85-93 |oclc=43483668 }}&lt;/ref&gt; criteria and address ADHD symptoms in adults. The six question ASRS Screener was later developed  as a subset of the WHO's eighteen question ASRS. At least one study has found that the six question ASRS Screener outperformed the eighteen question ASRS in diagnosing ADHD in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kessler |first1=Ronald C. |last2=Adler |first2=Lenard |last3=Ames |first3=Minnie |last4=Demler |first4=Olga |last5=Faraone |first5=Steve |last6=Hiripi |last7=Eva |last8=Howes |first8=Mary J. |last9=Jin |first9=Robert |last10=Secnik |first10=Kristina |last11=Spencer |first11=Thomas |last12=Ustun |first12=T.

ASRS has been adapted to other languages including Spanish and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yeh |first1=Chin-Bin |last2=[[Susan Shur-Fen|Gau]] |first2=[[Susan Shur-Fen]] |last3=Kessler |first3=Ronald C. |last4=Wu |first4=Yu-Yu |date=March 2008 | title = Psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the adult ADHD Self-report Scale | url = | journal=International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 45-54 | pmid = 18286465 | doi=10.1002/mpr.241 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramos-Quiroga |first1=JA |last2=Daigre |first2=C |last3=Valero |first3=S |last4=Bosch |first4=R |last5=Gómez-Barros |first5=N |last6=Nogueira |first6=M |last7=Palomar |first7=G |last8=Roncero |first8=C |last9=Casas |first9=M | pmid = 19396760 | volume=48 | issue=9 |title=Validación al español de la escala de cribado del trastorno por déficit de atención/hiperactividad en adultos (ASRS v. 1.1): una nueva estrategia de puntuación  | trans-title=Validation of the Spanish version of the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adult screening scale (ASRS v. 1.1): a novel scoring strategy |date=1 May 2009 | journal=Revista de Neurología | pages=449-52 |language=Spanish |url=http://www.neurologia.com/articulo/2008677/eng |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conducted research proved that the scale is a valid and useful tool for the [[Medical screening|screening]] of adult ADHD.&lt;ref name=Adler2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adler |first1=Lenard A. |last2=Spencer |first2=Thomas |last3=Faraone |first3=Stephen V. |last4=Kessler |first4=Ronald C. |last5=Howes |first5=Mary J. |last6=Biederman |first6=Joseph |last7=Secnik |first7=Kristina |date=July 2006 |title=Validity of Pilot Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) to Rate Adult ADHD Symptoms |journal=Annals of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=145-148 |doi=10.1080/10401230600801077 |pmid=16923651 |url=https://triggered.clockss.org/ServeContent?url=http://tandfonline.stanford.clockss.org%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fdoi%2Fpdf%2F10.1080%2F10401230600801077 |format=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ASRS was externally validated on approximately 60 adult patients, and showed high internal consistency and high concurrent validity with the physician-administered ADHD rating system.&lt;ref name=Adler2006/&gt;

==Scoring==
Each question can be answered on a five item [[Likert scale]], based on a scale of frequency ranging from "Never" to "Very Often". Answers are scored as either positive or negative and the threshold is different for individual questions. Answers of "Never" and "Rarely" are always scored negative, answers of "Often and Very Often" are always scored positive, and answers of "Sometimes" are scored positively in only seven of the eighteen questions. Four or more positive answers in Part A is indicative of ADHD symptoms.

'''Beronda Montgomery''' is a [[Michigan State University]] Foundation Professor in the Departments of Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology and of Microbiology &amp; Molecular Genetics. She is also a member of the MSU-[[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] Plant Research Laboratory. Her research group investigates how photosynthetic organisms adapt to changes in their environment. Her scholarship extends beyond biology and into studying mentorship and faculty development to develop evidence-based strategies to foster equity and inclusion in academia.

== Education and early career ==
Montgomery received her Bachelor's degree in biology from [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and her Master's degree in biology from [[University of Central Arkansas]]. She then went on to complete her PhD in Plant Biology at the [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | degree = Ph.D. | url = https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01UCD_ALMA51269127720003126&amp;context=L&amp;vid=01UCD_V1&amp;search_scope=everything_scope&amp;isFrbr=true&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US |title=Regulation of Distinct Aspects of Photomorphogenesis in Transgenic Plants|last=Montgomery|first=Beronda La-Kaye | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=University of California, Davis|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later became a postdoctoral fellow in Microbial Biology at [[University of Indiana]] with the support of a [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0102084&amp;HistoricalAwards=false|title=NSF Award Search: Award#0102084 - Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2001|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, she joined the research faculty at [[Michigan State University]].

== Research ==
Montgomery's research centers on the dynamic molecular mechanisms that allow [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms—from [[cyanobacteria]] to plant species—to adapt and respond to changes in their photoenvironment. These organisms must respond to changes in light sources in order to continue photosynthesis, so they've developed finely tuned growth and developmental responses. Montgomery's lab studies a number of molecules that play an important role in this process, including light-absorbing pigments and light-sensing receptors, or [[Phytochrome|phytochromes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oh S, Montgomery BL | title = Phytochrome-dependent coordinate control of distinct aspects of nuclear and plastid gene expression during anterograde signaling and photomorphogenesis | journal = Frontiers in Plant Science | volume = 5 | pages = 171 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24817873 | pmc = 4012200 | doi = 10.3389/fpls.2014.00171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oh S, Montgomery BL | title = Phytochrome-induced SIG2 expression contributes to photoregulation of phytochrome signalling and photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 64 | issue = 18 | pages = 5457–72 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24078666 | pmc = 3871806 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/ert308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, her group works to better understand how these molecules regulate cell morphology and physiology in response to different environments and stressors, focusing their attention on ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabadopsis]]'' organ systems and cyanobacteria as model organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agostoni M, Logan-Jackson AR, Heinz ER, Severin GB, Bruger EL, Waters CM, Montgomery BL | title = Homeostasis of Second Messenger Cyclic-di-AMP Is Critical for Cyanobacterial Fitness and Acclimation to Abiotic Stress | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 9 | pages = 1121 | date = 2018 | pmid = 29896182 | pmc = 5986932 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2018.01121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agostoni M, Waters CM, Montgomery BL | title = Regulation of biofilm formation and cellular buoyancy through modulating intracellular cyclic di-GMP levels in engineered cyanobacteria | journal = Biotechnology and Bioengineering | volume = 113 | issue = 2 | pages = 311–9 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26192200 | doi = 10.1002/bit.25712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Busch AW, Montgomery BL | title = The Tryptophan-Rich Sensory Protein (TSPO) is Involved in Stress-Related and Light-Dependent Processes in the Cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 6 | pages = 1393 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26696996 | pmc = 4677103 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2015.01393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her research contributions have been recognized by the [[American Academy of Microbiology]] when she was elected as a fellow in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2018/msu-professors-elected-fellows-of-the-american-academy-of-microbiology/|title=MSU professors elected fellows of the American Academy of Microbiology|last=University|first=Michigan State|work=MSUToday|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As of 2016, Montgomery holds the title of MSU Foundation Professor in recognition of her scholarly accomplishments, disciplinary development, commitment to creativity, and teaching excellence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msufoundation.org/msuprofessorship/|title=Michigan State University Foundation – MSU Foundation Professorships|last=Richard|first=Aaryn | name-list-format = vanc |website=www.msufoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mentorship ==
Montgomery also conducts scholarship and training initiatives on mentoring, particularly around issues relating to mentoring and retaining students and junior scientists from underrepresented backgrounds. She has published extensively on evidence-based strategies to nurture and retain talent in academia, developing strategies for effective mentorship that center on the individual and their specific needs and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asbmb.org/asbmbtoday/201602/Diversity/Voices/|title=Evidence-based Training and Mentoring Practices: Practical Implications for Improving Diversity in STEM Education and Training|last=Montgomery|first=Beronda | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016|website=www.asbmb.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montgomery|first=Beronda L. | name-list-format = vanc |date=April 2017|title=Mapping a Mentoring Roadmap and Developing a Supportive Network for Strategic Career Advancement |journal=SAGE Open|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=215824401771028|doi=10.1177/2158244017710288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whittaker JA, Montgomery BL | title = Cultivating Diversity and Competency in STEM: Challenges and Remedies for Removing Virtual Barriers to Constructing Diverse Higher Education Communities of Success | journal = Journal of Undergraduate Neuroscience Education | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = A44-51 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23493445 | pmc = 3592737 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery has also worked with her colleagues to create sustainable opportunities for career development and enhancement.

Production of Bocasan appears to have ceased by 2003. A similar product, [[Amosan]] was available for a period before also ceasing production in 2010. As of 2013, a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] pharmacy offers the same formulation under the name Bikosan&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bik-bik.com/info/14/bikosan-replaces-bocasan&lt;/ref&gt;

It was used to aid treatment, in adults or children over 5 years old, of [[periodontal]] conditions such as [[canker sores]], [[denture irritation]], orthodontic irritation, or after dental procedures.

Bocasan was packaged in a 1.7 gram envelope, and contained 69.72% sodium perborate monohydrate and 29.68% sodium hydrogen tartrate anhydrous. To use, the contents were dissolved in 30 cubic centimetres of warm water. Half the amount was swilled around the mouth for two minutes and discarded, and the procedure repeated with the remainder. Treatment was recommended three times a day after meals.

'''Clarence Cook "C.C." Little''' (October 6, 1888 – December 22, 1971) was an [[Americans|American]] [[genetics]], [[cancer]], and [[tobacco]] researcher and [[academic administrator]].

==Early life==
C. C. Little was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] and attended [[Harvard University]] after his secondary education at the [[Noble and Greenough School]]. While studying under [[W. E. Castle]], Little began his work with [[mouse|mice]], focusing on inheritance, transplants, and grafts. He also was an assistant dean and secretary to the president. His most important research occurred at Harvard, including what some call his most brilliant work, "A [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] explanation for the inheritance of a trait that has apparently non-Mendelian characteristics". His observations on transplant rejection became codified into the "five laws of transplant immunology" by [[George Davis Snell|George Snell]]. Little developed the "DBA ([[Dilute, Brown and non-Agouti]])" [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of mice while at Harvard. For his research, he received posthumously the 1978 Cancer Research Institute [[William B. Coley Award]].

Little received an A.B. from [[Harvard University]] in 1910, an M.S. in 1912, and D.Sc. in 1914 in zoology, with special focus in the new science of genetics.

During [[World War I]] Little served in the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]], attaining the rank of Major. Following the war he spent three years at the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]]. In 1921 he helped found the [[American Birth Control League]] with [[Margaret Sanger]] and [[Lothrop Stoddard]].

==Career==
Little accepted the post of President of the [[University of Maine]] in 1922, becoming at age 33 the youngest university president in the country. While there he started a summer laboratory in [[Bar Harbor, Maine|Bar Harbor]]. In 1925 he left to become the President of the [[University of Michigan]]. His tenure at the university was controversial due to his outspokenness in favor of [[eugenics]], [[birth control]], and [[euthanasia]]. He left Michigan in 1929 in order to devote himself to his research at Bar Harbor. With funding from Detroit car manufacturers he was able to improve the facility for year-round use. He renamed it the "Jackson Laboratory" in honor of one donor, Roscoe B. Jackson of the [[Hudson Motor Car]] Corporation.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Also in 1929 he took on a part-time job as managing director of the American Society for the Control of Cancer (later became the [[American Cancer Society]] (ACS)) and served as President to the [[American Eugenics Society]].

Funding for the [[Jackson Laboratory]] was extremely limited during the [[Great Depression]], but it received one of the first grants from the newly formed [[National Cancer Institute]] in 1938. Little energetically developed both the lab and the ACS, and by 1944 they were shipping 9000 mice a week to other laboratories. The laboratory and all of the livestock were destroyed in the Great Bar Harbor Fire in the Fall of 1947.  The lab was quickly rebuilt and most mouse strains were recovered from other labs around the world. By 1950 the lab was maintaining 60 inbred strains, and had developed the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid that became widely used for chemical testing. Little resigned in 1954.

His last major post, from 1954 to 1969, was as the Scientific Director of the Scientific Advisory Board of the [[Tobacco Industry Research Committee]] (renamed [[Council for Tobacco Research]] in 1964). In that role he was a leading scientific voice of the [[tobacco industry]] and oversaw a USD 1 million research budget that gave grants to hundreds of scientists. [http://tobaccodocuments.org/bliley_pm/22809.html#images][http://tobaccodocuments.org/tplp/ATMXPRIV0009047-9049.html#images] In 1959 he refuted his earlier assertion, made as Director of the ACS, that inhaling fine particles is unhealthy, and stated that smoking does not cause lung cancer and is at most a minor contributing factor. [http://tobaccodocuments.org/tplp/ATMXPRIV00013038-3041.html#images]. A decade later he said, "there is no demonstrated causal relationship between smoking or any disease."[https://web.archive.org/web/20070320105418/http://tobaccodocuments.org/nysa_ti_s1/TI55842608.html] In keeping with his earlier research he believed that the main cause of cancer was genetic, not environmental.

==Death and legacy==
Little died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1971 in [[Ellsworth, Maine]] at the age of 83.

The C. C. Little Science Building at the [[University of Michigan]] was named in his honor. In 2017, five faculty members and an undergraduate student submitted a formal request to University of Michigan President [[Mark Schlissel]] to change the building's name because of Little's previous support of eugenics. The building’s sign without Little’s name was replaced on March 29, 2018.&lt;ref name="themichigandailygroupsubmitsofficialrequesttorenamecclittlebuilding"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Basha|first1=Riyah|title=Group Submits Request to Rename C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2394">A '''chipper''' is an occasional drug user who does not use drugs with the regularity or frequency that is typical of [[Substance dependence|addicts]]. It is used particularly to refer to [[opiate]] users and [[tobacco]] smokers.

It can also refer to people who use various recreational drugs, but none particularly habitually.

== "Social" smokers ==
Such occasional users of tobacco are sometimes thought of as ''social smokers'' which is similar in meaning to ''[[Drinking culture#Social drinking|social drinkers]]''. However, evidence indicates that this only characterizes a minority of chippers.&lt;ref&gt;Shiffman, S. &amp; Paty, J.A. (2006). Smoking patterns of non-dependent smokers: Contrasting chippers and dependent smokers. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 115, 509-523. &lt;/ref&gt;  The prevalence of non-daily smoking in the U.S. has increased by 40% between 1996 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt; Centers for Disease Control (2003). Prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults and changes in prevalence of current and some day smoking -- United States, 1996-2001. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 52, 303-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tipping point ==
Chippers are given as an example in ''[[The Tipping Point]]''; if chippers begin smoking above a certain threshold (or tipping point), then they will develop regular cravings and become addicted.

== History ==
The term dates at least to the 1970s, where it is used in reference to opiate use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/133/1/37 The natural history of "chipping"], Am J Psychiatry 1976; 133:37-40, NE Zinberg and RC Jacobson&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was notably used in reference to tobacco by psychologist Dr. Saul Shiffman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Shiffman, S. (1989). Tobacco "Chippers": Individual differences in tobacco dependence. Psychopharmacology, 97, 539-547.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Consejo de Salud Rural Andino''' (CSRA) is a [[non profit]], [[non-governmental]] organization that specializes in administering health networks and it offers services in designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating health projects with a community-based model. CSRA was established in 1983 by its parent organization, then known as Andean Rural Health Care in the [[United States]] and now known as Curamericas Global, Inc. Curamericas Global was founded in 1983 by [[Duke University]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] graduate Henry Perry III, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H. and Alice Weldon, Ph.D. The organization’s work was initially based in [[Bolivia]] and has since expanded its services to [[Haiti]], [[Liberia]] and [[Guatemala]]. Currently, Consejo de Salud Rural Andino in Bolivia has its headquarters in the city of [[La Paz]], a regional office in [[El Alto]], and a regional office in the city of [[Montero]].

Curamericas Global and CSRA are known for their development of the [http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAC582.pdf Census-Based, Impact-Oriented] Methodology. The CBIO is a community-based primary health care model that allows to better understand, effectively treat and accurately measure outcomes and impacts for the most common found causes of unnecessary suffering, sickness, including mortality reduction using census information and having collaboration from the community. CBIO implementation will first identify the entire programm population through visits at least biannually to all homes and then target selected high-impact services to those at highest risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perry|first=H.|last2=Robison|first2=N.|last3=Chavez|first3=D.|last4=Taja|first4=O.|last5=Hilari|first5=C.|last6=Shanklin|first6=D.|last7=Wyon|first7=J.|date=June 1998|title=The census-based, impact-oriented approach: its effectiveness in promoting child health in Bolivia|journal=Health Policy and Planning|volume=13|issue=2|pages=140–151|issn=0268-1080|pmid=10180402}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBIO approach incorporates:

A community census of households and a health assessment of the project area, a drawing of maps and numbering of households, and the development of a program plan with community members that includes both epidemiologically driven health objectives as well as community perceived health priorities.

Native doctors, nurses, community health workers, and volunteers then conduct regularly scheduled home visits to targeted households whose census information reveals a high risk of illness or death. During these home visits, health knowledge and practices are measured and vital events are recorded so that families’ illnesses, health experiences, deaths, births, and migrations are tracked. This information is entered into a health information system so; program interventions can be measured and then analyzed with the participation of local people and leaders of the community.

'''Curiosity quotient''' is a term put forth by [[author]] and [[journalist]] [[Thomas L. Friedman]] as part of an illustrative formula to explain how individuals can be powerfully motivated to learn about a personally interesting subject, whether or not they possess a particularly high intelligence quotient (IQ).  The non-mathematical and fictitious formula is CQ + PQ &gt; IQ; where CQ is "curiosity quotient" and PQ is "passion quotient."  Thomas Friedman states that when curiosity is paired with passion in the exploration of a subject of interest, an individual may be able to acquire an amount of knowledge comparable that of a person who is exceptionally intelligent, because of the vast amount of information resources available through the Internet.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Thomas L.|title=The world is flat : a brief history of the twenty-first century|year=2007|publisher=Picador/Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-42507-4|pages=314|url=http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/bookshelf/the-world-is-flat|edition=1st Picador ed., Further updated and expanded, [Pbk. ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This formula is not meant to be taken in a literal sense, nor is it a measurement tool for assessing or predicting the intelligence, productivity or success of a student, employee or individual.

==Proposed formula==
[[Image:Thomas Friedman CQ Formula.png|thumb|240px|right|Thomas Friedman's formula for CQ]]

Friedman's claim is that Curiosity quotient plus [[Passion quotient]] is greater than [[Intelligence Quotient]].  

There is no evidence that this inequality is true. Friedman may believe that curiosity and passion are 'greater' than intelligence, but there is no evidence to suggest that the sum of a person's curiosity and passion quotients will always exceed their IQ. Indeed, given the ordinal nature of psychometric quotients, it is not clear whether it makes sense to add the curiosity and passion quotients or even if they can have numerical values attributed to them.

According to Friedman, [[curiosity]] and [[Passion (emotion)|passion]] are key components for education in a world where information is readily available to everyone and where [[global market]]s reward those who have learned how to learn and are self-motivated to learn.

Friedman states, "Give me the kid with a passion to learn and a curiosity to discover and I will take him or her over the less passionate kid with a huge IQ every day of the week." IQ "still matters, but CQ and PQ ... matter even more." Friedman further states that "it is more important to be passionate and curious than to be merely smart."

==No viable test==
To date, there are no existing [[university]] tests or [[accredited]] testing evaluations which will produce a [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] CQ or PQ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45211">'''Dental emergency''' is a broad, umbrella term used to describe an issue involving the teeth and supporting tissues that is of high importance to be fixed/treated by the relevant professional. Dental emergencies do not always involve pain, although this is a common signal that something needs to be looked at. Pain can originate from the tooth, surrounding tissues or can have the sensation of originating in the teeth but be caused by an independent source ([[orofacial pain]] and [[toothache]]). Depending on the type of pain experienced an experienced clinician can determine the likely cause and can treat the issue as each tissue type gives different messages in a dental emergency. Many emergencies exist and can range from bacterial/fungal/viral infections to a fractured tooth or [[dental restoration]], each requiring an individual response and treatment that is unique to the situation. Fractures ([[dental trauma]]) can occur anywhere on the tooth or to the surrounding bone, depending on the site and extent of fracture the treatment options will vary. [[Dental restoration]] falling out or fracturing can also be considered a dental emergency as these can impact on function in regards to aesthetics, eating and pronunciation and as such should be tended to with the same haste as loss of tooth tissue. All dental emergencies should be treated under the supervision or guidance of a dental health professional in order to preserve the teeth for as long as possible.

==Definition==

There is no widely accepted definition of what constitutes a dental emergency. By contrast, a [[medical emergency]] is often more precisely defined as an acute condition which presents an immediate threat to life, limb, vision or long term health. Consequently, dental emergencies can rarely be described as medical emergencies in these terms.

Some define a dental emergency in terms of the individual's willingness to attend for emergency dental treatment at any time at short notice, stating that persons who are fussy about when they are available for treatment are not true emergency cases.&lt;ref name = "Mitchell_2009"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = Laura | last2 = McCaul | first2 = David A. Mitchell | name-list-format = vanc | title = Oxford Handbook of Clinical Dentistry | date = 2009 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-955330-3 | edition = 5th | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bF3DvBjvC0EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=oxford+handbook+of+clinical+dentistry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L8OmU-GNIIvy7AaVuoDQCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=emergency&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|702}}

There are often divergent opinions between clinicians and patients as to what constitutes a dental emergency. E.g. a person may suddenly lose a filling, crown, bridge, etc. and although they are completely pain-free, still have great cosmetic concerns about the appearance of their teeth and demand an emergency treatment on the basis of perceived social disability.

==Dental Pain==
{{Hatnote|See also [[Orofacial pain]] and [[Toothache]]}}

===What is pain?===
Pain is described as 'an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.&lt;ref name="Greenwood_2012"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Greenwood M, Corbett I | year = 2012 | title = Dental Emergencies | location = Chicester, West Sussex | publisher = Blackwell Publishing Ltd. | isbn = 978-0-470-67396-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most common reasons patients seek dental treatment and many diseases or conditions may be responsible for the cause.&lt;ref name="pmid16416713"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hargreaves K, Abbott PV | title = Drugs for pain management in dentistry | journal = Australian Dental Journal | volume = 50 | issue = 4 Suppl 2 | pages = S14–22 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16416713 | doi = 10.1111/j.1834-7819.2005.tb00378.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Odontogenic pain===
Odontogenic pain is pain associated with the teeth, originating in the dental pulp and/or the peri-radicular tissues.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"&gt;{{ cite book | vauthors = Hargraves K, Cohen S | year = 2011 | title = Pathways to the Pulp | edition = 10th | location = St Louis | publisher = Elsevier Mosby | isbn = 978-0-323-06489-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following table shows the different classifications of pulp status.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Classification of pulp status !! Features
|-
| Healthy pulp || 
* Asymptomatic with mild and transient responses to various stimuli e.g. hot, cold pressure 
* Histologically no inflammation is present 
* Can include dentine hypersenitivity 
|-
| Reversible pulpitis || 
* Area of exposed dentine or pathway to exposed dentine 
* Stimulated by hot, cold, sweet, touch, biting   
* Mild sharp pain of short duration   
* “Sharp” “shooting” pain   
* Well-localised   
*  No spontaneous or nocturnal pain   
*  Histologically the pulp would show a superficial zone of inflammation 
|-
| Irreversible pulpitis || 
* Area of exposed dentine 
* Stimulated by hot, cold, sweet, touch, biting  
* Moderate to severe pain that lingers  
* Poorly localised 
* Spontaneous and nocturnal pain  
* Histologically the pulp is vital and exhibits an intense inflammatory response 
|-
| Pulpal necrosis || 
* Area of exposed dentine that has resulted in pulp exposure to the oral environment 
* Usually no true symptoms as the pulpal sensory nerves have been destroyed  
* Histologically the pulp is non-vital and usually is heavily infiltrated with bacteria 
|-
| Pulp necrobiosis || 
* Phenomenon that occurs in multirooted teeth where one part of the pulp is vital and irreversibly inflamed and the other parts are necrotic 
|}

====Peri-radicular pain====
Peri- radicular pain can be of pulpal origin, most commonly due to disease in the pulp extending into the peri-radicular tissues but can also be of periodontal origin due to [[periodontal disease]].&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt; [[Apical periodontitis]] is a term used to describe acute inflammation of the periodontal ligament surrounding the tooth. This can be caused by inflammatory mediators from irreversibly inflamed pulp, bacterial toxins from necrotic pulp, restorations that have not been property contoured and in some cases, from treatments such as [[endodontic treatment]].&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt; There is both an acute and chronic form of this condition.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt; Acute apical periodontitis features include moderate to severe pain, usually stimulated by touch and pressure and may also include spontaneous pain.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt; The chronic form of the condition can be asymptomatic but may also include pain from surrounding tissues when stimulated.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt; Apical abscess is a term used to describe an extension of apical periodontitis where the bacteria have infiltrated the peri radicular tissues and are causing a severe inflammatory response; there is also an acute and chronic form of this condition.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt; An acute apical abscess can cause facial swelling and can cause other systemic consequences such as a high temperature and feelings of malaise.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt; In some cases this condition can be life-threatening when the inflammation compromises the airway; this is termed Ludwig’s Angina.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt; A chronic apical abscess can be asymptomatic as the pressure from the inflammation is being drained through a sinus tract; a draining sinus can usually be seen clinically.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt; A [[periodontal abscess]] is a localised inflammation affecting the periodontal tissues.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt; It is caused by bacteria pre-existing in a periodontal pockets, traumatic insertion of bacteria or foreign body or can occur after periodontal treatment.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt; This condition has a rapid onset, is stimulated by touch and involves spontaneous pain.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt; It is important to note that an apical abscess may drain through the periodontal pocket giving a false interpretation of periodontal abscess or a periodontal abscess may appear at the apex of the tooth giving a false interpretation of apical abscess; a tooth may also have both lesions at one point in time.&lt;ref name="Hargraves_2011"/&gt;

==Dental Trauma==
{{Main|Dental trauma}}
Dental trauma refers to an injury on hard and soft tissues of the oral cavity and face. This includes the teeth and surrounding tissues, the periodontium, tongue, lips and cheeks. It is more prevalent with children between 8– 12 years of age but can still happen to anyone. The prognosis of the tooth is worse the longer it is out of the mouth.&lt;ref name="pmid14998408"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Jundi SH | title = Type of treatment, prognosis, and estimation of time spent to manage dental trauma in late presentation cases at a dental teaching hospital: a longitudinal and retrospective study | journal = Dental Traumatology : Official Publication of International Association for Dental Traumatology | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14998408 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-4469.2004.00218.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of dental trauma affecting different surfaces of the teeth and periodontium.

===Injuries to the hard dental tissues and the pulp&lt;ref name="Greenwood_2012"/&gt;===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Description !! Clinical status !! Treatment !! Deciduous tooth
|-
| '''Enamel/ crown infraction''' || Incomplete crack limited to the enamel with no loss of tooth structure  || Visible fracture or craze line/s, no tender to percussion, no mobility, positive to vitality testing, no radiographic abnormalities || No immediate treatment required and no follow-up needed if no associated dental injuries || No treatment required
|-
| '''Enamel fracture''' || Loss of tooth surface confined at the enamel  || Loss of enamel, not TTP, no mobility, positive vitality testing || Smooth edges, restore tooth or attach tooth fragment if available. Dependent on the size of the fracture. Follow up radiograph in a year || Restore or smoothen tooth. Review 4–6 months until exfoliation 
|-
| '''Crown and root fracture''' || Involves dentin and cementum but not necessarily pulp || TTP, mobile, positive vitality testing, pain on biting and sensitivity to air temperature. Apical extension of fracture is visible radiographically || There are a number of treatment options for crown and root fracture depending on the clinical findings. Initial treatment is to stabilise loose segments by cementing into place if fragment is still available. If it has been lost then a supragingival restoration is done. Monitor tooth 3, 6,  12 months to 2 years with radiographs || Extract tooth and monitor potential damage to permanent successor tooth 
|-
| '''Root fracture''' || Fracture involving the cementum, dentin and pulp, with coronal portion of root displaced and apical portion of pulp remains vital || Coronal segment may be mobile and sometimes displaced, tender, vitality testing usually negative. Root fracture is visible radiographically appearing horizontally or diagonally planed || Splint to stabilise loose fragment for 4– 4 months depending location of fracture and then root canal treatment. Clinical and radiographic analysis after 8 weeks, 4, 6, 12 months and yearly for 5 years || Extract tooth and monitor for potential damage to permanent successor
|-
| '''Uncomplicated crown fracture''' || Fracture of the enamel with/ without dentin involvement, with no disturbance to the pulp || Visible loss of enamel and dentine, not TTP, normal mobility, positive to vitality testing || Tooth fragment is bonded on or restoration. Follow-up 6–8 weeks and 1 year || Smoothen sharp edges and/ or restore tooth. Review with radiographs after 6– 8 weeks. Monitor until exfoliation
|-
| '''Complicated crown fracture''' || Involves the enamel, dentin and pulp || Loss of enamel and dentine with exposure of pulp, no TTP, normal mobility, pulp sensitive to touch || Pulp capping, partial pulpotomy or coronal pulpotomy if root of tooth still forming or root canal treatment. Review and monitor every 3 months and then yearly || Extract tooth or pulp treatment if patient is cooperative. Monitor signs for symptoms and pathology
|}

=== Injuries involving periodontal tissues &lt;ref name="Greenwood_2012"/&gt;===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Description !! Clinical status !! Treatment - permanent tooth !! Deciduous tooth
|-
| '''Concussion''' || Injury to tooth supporting structures with no displacement of tooth || Visually no displacement of tooth, TTP, no mobility, usually a positive vitality test and no abnormalities radiographically || No immediate treatment required. Monitor pulpal condition for a year || Same treatment as permanent teeth
|-
| '''Sublaxation''' || Injury to tooth supporting structures with loosening of the tooth however with no displacement || Tender to percussion and increased mobility but no displacement of tooth as injury limited to the tooth supporting structures. Bleeding at gingival crevice || No immediate treatment required. Monitor pulpal condition for a year || Same treatment as permanent teeth
|-
| '''Extrusion''' || Loosening and partial displacement of the tooth out of its socket. Alveolar bone is still intact however may result in a partial or total separation of periodontal ligament || Tooth appears elongated, TTP, excessively mobile, vitality testing inconclusive || Reposition tooth back into tooth socket after surface has been cleaned with saline. Splint is applied and to be monitored after two weeks for further treatment. Root canal treatment where signs of pulpal necrosis || Extract tooth. If minimal extrusion then leave and monitor
|-
| '''Lateral Luxation''' || Displacement of tooth in a lateral position – labially, lingually, distally or mesially. Most seen case is crown towards the palate with the apex going labially. Sensitivity to touch is present as well as sulcular bleeding || Tooth displaced usually at a  palatal/ lingual or labial direction, sensitive to touch, sulcular bleeding, tooth locked into bone. Radiographically the tooth shows a widened periodontal ligament space || Tooth is repositioned into its original location and is splinted for 4 weeks  || If crown displaced towards the palate and is not in traumatic occlusion then no treatment is required as apex of the tooth is away from the developing tooth germ. If apex of tooth is displaced towards the palate and making contact with the tooth germ then tooth is extracted
|-
| '''Intrusive Luxation''' || Displacement of tooth into the alveolar bone (pushed into the socket) causing fracture of the alveolar bone. It is the most damaging injury to the tooth and supporting tissues as ankylosis and pulp necrosis can occur. In severe cases, 100% of the crown is not visible || Tooth displaced axially into alveolar bone, no mobility, negative to vitality testing. Periodontal ligament space may be absent radiographically || Depending on severity of displacement, tooth may be left to allow for spontaneous eruption. If severe then orthodontic reposition or surgical repositioning is needed. Root canal treatment after 12 weeks || Tooth is extracted if apex of the root is in the developing tooth bud
|-
| '''Avulsion''' || Tooth is completely displaced out of the socket. Desiccation of periodontal ligament can not occur, as well as pulpal necrosis if no immediate action is taken place || Tooth is absent from socket || Depends on the maturity of the tooth, how the tooth was stored and patient cooperation. If tooth has been kept in favourable conditions and periodontal ligament is not necrotic, then tooth is replanted || Tooth is not replanted to avoid damage to developing tooth germ

==Restorative emergencies==

===Lost or broken filling===
A fractured, ditched or dislodged filling that is broken or lost may cause discomfort or sharp pain due to jagged edges. There can be aesthetical concerns if the filling is in a visible area. Patients need to be aware of the sharp edges and ensure their tongue does not constantly apply pressure around that area, as it can cause cuts to the tongue. However, in some cases the result of the loss of a filling can cause irritation to the side of the cheek and potentially lead to an [[ulcer]]. Sharp edges can easily be dealt with by levelling the filling or tooth edges from your local dentist during the emergency appointment. [[Hypersensitivity]] issues may also arise, short sharp pain caused by exposed underlying dentine, after the deterioration of the filling material.&lt;ref name="Greenwood_2012"/&gt;

Reasons for the deterioration of a restoration vary in different cases, the cause may be underlying caries or it could be occlusal trauma, caused from natural dentition during mastication. The longevity of restorative materials could also be a factor; the survival rates of amalgam are usually 10–15 years, composite 7 years, while gold and ceramic fillings have over a 20-year longevity.&lt;ref name="Greenwood_2012"/&gt;

During the emergency appointment the dentist will need to take a set of radiographs to assess for any underlying [[caries]], bone loss or possible [[abscess]]. The clinical examination will detect the reasons behind the failure of the restoration. Upon treatment the dentist will provide options on the tooth’s prognosis, these may include a new restoration, extraction, root canal or placement of a crown. The tooth prognosis includes the tooth’s vitality and restorability.

* '''Crack, fracture and mobility'''
 
A crack, fracture and the mobility of a tooth are all interrelated as the pain and symptoms experienced from a tooth that has been cracked are very similar to that of a tooth that has been fractured.&lt;ref name="Greenwood_2012"/&gt;
A tooth crack is defined as an incomplete fracture of enamel or dentine and therefore is not usually associated with noticeable mobility.&lt;ref name="Darby_2010"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Darby ML, Walsh MM | year = 2010 | title = Dental Hygiene Theory and Practice | edition = 3rd | location = St Louis, Missouri | publisher = Saunders Elsevier | isbn = 978-1-4160-5357-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The cause of a tooth crack can be by excessive force applied to a healthy tooth or physiologic forces applied to a weakened tooth. The teeth most commonly involved are usually the lower molars, followed by the upper premolars and molars. The condition is extremely common in the age range of 30–60 years.&lt;ref name="Greenwood_2012"/&gt;

A diagnosis of a cracked tooth is extremely difficult. Careful history and assessment of the symptoms presented needs to be taken into account; radiographs and certain tests will be conducted in the dental office. Most common symptoms are cold sensitivity, sharp pain when using force to chew, these pain results from the release of pressure and are very important indicators of a cracked tooth. However, the symptoms may differ from various patients, subject to the depth and orientation of the crack.

===Broken crown===
Crowns can become broken by a fracture, non-retentive preparation, secondary caries, weak cement, excessive occlusal forces, decementation or loosening of the crown.&lt;ref name="Darby_2010"/&gt; The consequences of a crown becoming loose include the risk of ingestion and less likely, inhalation. The management of the loose crown includes immediate recementation or a replacement crown, depending on the assessment conducted by the dentist.

The factors that are taken into consideration in making this decision include the strength of the temporary crown to be placed and occlusal forces. Thus, a thorough occlusal examination is of paramount importance, strength of the cement, a strong alternative of cement should be considered. The occlusion assessment should also include the static and functional occlusion as well as the possible presence of Para functional habits, such as clenching or bruxism.

Management includes cleaning all the cement and residues, to carefully inspect for any underlying caries or fractures. Details that need to be assessed include margins, gingivae and contact points; occlusion needs to be checked in both ICP and in lateral and protrusive excursions, before the crown can be re-cemented. Stronger cement should be used than the original such as resin cements, especially in cases of heavy occlusal forces.

In some cases, immediate reconstruction of the abutment may be deemed inappropriate, if the underlying structure is deemed deficient due to caries or a fracture then this issue needs to be addressed. The treatment plan may vary with the addition of a root canal treatment or a temporary crown for the reconstruction of a new crown.

* '''Fracture of a porcelain veneer or a porcelain-fused-to-metal crown'''
Immediate management includes a chair side repair of the fractured veneer with composite material. Bonding composite to the exposed metal will involve achieving macro mechanical retention by making grooves and notches or abrading the surface. 
Bonding material back onto exposed porcelain involves abrading, hydrofluoric acid etching and silanating then followed by a conventional bonding procedure. Composite patch will remain a temporary solution as the longevity of composite restorations is not predictable as well as the colour of composite is not as stable as porcelain for aesthetical reasons.&lt;ref name="Greenwood_2012"/&gt;

===Broken denture===

A fracture can involve any damage to the denture. Any type of repair to the denture is much less ideal then making a new one. The ratio of fracture to a denture is a 1:3 ratio of the upper to lower.&lt;ref name="Darby_2010"/&gt;

The most common reason for fracture in a denture; is accidental dropping of the denture in the case of the lower denture, and improper fitting and stability of the denture in the upper denture.

* '''Techniques to prevent denture from being broken:'''

# Use a basin of water in the sink, to help prevent the denture from breaking if happens to fall on a hard surface.
# Hold the denture in non-dominant hand with a firm, but gentle grasp.
# Do not use any powdered or abrasive cleaners, including most regular toothpastes, they are too abrasive and produce scratches on the denture surface.
# Avoid excessive scrubbing as this can damage the denture.
# Dry denture and place in a plastic container stored some where safe over night.

===Broken or loose implants===
Implant success is relatively high, the rate of implant survival is between 85-95%,&lt;ref name="pmid3527955"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Albrektsson T, Zarb G, Worthington P, Eriksson AR | title = The long-term efficacy of currently used dental implants: a review and proposed criteria of success | journal = The International Journal of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Implants | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–25 | date = 1986 | pmid = 3527955 | doi = | url = http://www.idis.academy/pdf/articles/5.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not uncommon for emergency management of a failing implant or one of its components. The failure is most likely due to infection of the implant. It is highly recommended to visit or refer patient to the specialist who provided the implant. 
 
Late failures that occur with implants are usually due to moderate to severe bone loss, mostly located in the posterior areas of teeth and involve a multi-unit prosthesis. A fracture or decementation of a post or loosening of the abutment screw of an implant could be the result of dissolved cement, secondary caries, use of a weak post, or excessive occlusal forces.&lt;ref name="Darby_2010"/&gt;
Oral home care needs to remain at a high standard, brushing twice a day for the duration of two minutes with the use of fluoridated tooth paste. Interdental cleaning once a day using either floss, interdental brushes, wood sticks. Regular dental appointments every 6 months to maintain gingival health, professional cleans, radiographs to examine the bone loss and the implant status. All the following is needed to prolong the longevity of the implant and reduce the risk of [[peri-implantitis]].

== Acute oral medical and surgical conditions ==
[[File:Abces dentaire.jpg|thumb|right|An abscess originating from a tooth which has spread to involve the [[buccal space]]. Above, deformation of the cheek on the second day. Below, deformation on the third day.]]
An acute condition may be defined as a suddenly presenting disorder, usually with only a short history of symptoms, but with a degree of severity that causes significant disruption to the patient.&lt;ref name="Greenwood_2012"/&gt;

Types of acute conditions

=== Orofacial swelling ===
A [[swelling (medical)|swelling]] is a transient abnormal enlargement of a body part or area not caused by proliferation of cells but by accumulation of fluid in tissues. It can occur throughout the body (generalized), or a specific part or organ can be affected (localized). A swelling may arise intra-orally or externally around the face, jaws and neck and can be caused by trauma (hematoma, swelling due to fracture, [[TMJ]] dislocation), infection or inflammation. Swelling can occur in the gums, palate, lips, buccal space, etc. It can happen due to periodontal problems, infection, abscess, cysts, allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock), salivary gland tumour, inflammation or obstruction of salivary gland.

=== Cellulitis ===
Bacterial infection in the oro-facial region can lead to abscess and swelling. The rapid spread of this infection through connective tissue spaces, is often referred to as cellulitis. The clinical features of cellulitis are a painful, diffuse, brawny swelling. The overlying skin is red, tense and shiny. There is usually an associated trismus, cervical lymphadenopathy, malaise and pyrexia. Cellulitis usually develops
quickly, over the course of hours, and may follow an inadequately managed or ignored local dental infection. If the infection spreads to involve the floor of mouth and pharyngeal spaces, then the airway can be compromised. Initially, the floor of the mouth will be raised and the patient will have difficulty in swallowing saliva; this
pools and may be observed running from the patient’s mouth. This sign indicates the need for urgent management. Cellulitis involving the tissue spaces on both sides of the floor of mouth is described as Ludwig’s angina &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Coulthard P, Horner K, Sloan P, Theaker E | year = 2008 | title = Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Radiology, Pathology and Oral Medicine | location = Philadelphia, PA | publisher = Elsevier Limited | isbn = 978-0-443-06896-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such presentations require immediate attention.

Localised dental abscesses may be appropriately treated by intra-oral drainage via tooth extraction, opening of root canals and/or intra-oral incision and drainage. Wherever there are signs of spreading cervico-facial infection or significant systemic disturbance, however, patients should be referred urgently further management.

=== Pericoronitis ===
Pericoronitis is defined as inflammation in the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The acute form is characterised by severe pain, often referred to adjacent areas, causing loss of sleep, swelling of the pericoronal tissues, discharge of pus, trismus, regional lymphadenopathy, pain on swallowing, pyrexia, and in some cases spread of the infection to adjacent tissue
spaces.&lt;ref name="pmid19753908"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moloney J, Stassen LF | title = Pericoronitis: treatment and a clinical dilemma | journal = Journal of the Irish Dental Association | volume = 55 | issue = 4 | pages = 190–2 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19753908 | doi = | url = http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/234813/1/PericoronitisAugSept09.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Blistering disorders of oral mucosa (see [[vesiculobullous disease]])
* [[oral ulceration]]
* Disturbed orofacial sensory or motor function

=== Trismus ===

[[Trismus]] may be defined as inability to open the mouth due to muscle spasm, but the term is frequently used for limited movement of the jaw from any cause and usually refers to temporary limitation of movement.&lt;ref name="Darby_2010"/&gt; Trismus can occur as a result of temporomandibular joint disorder, infection, cancer therapy, complicated extraction, arthritis, complication from a mandibular block and fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Cawson RA, Odell EW | year = 2002 | edition = 7th | title = Oral Pathology and Oral Medicine | publisher = Elsevier Science Limited | isbn = 978-0-443-07106-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hemorrhage ===

Whilst [[haemorrhage]] from the oro-facial region may present spontaneously, particularly from gingival tissue as a result of a bleeding diathesis or a haematological abnormality such as leukaemia, the most common cause is in response to trauma or a post-operative haemorrhage following dental extraction.&lt;ref name="Greenwood_2012"/&gt;

=== Bony pathology, e.g. Infection of an odontogenic cyst ===
[[Cysts of the jaws|Cysts]] can be common lesions found in the jaw. They are defined as cavities filled with fluid or semi-fluid content, created from the resorption of bone. They can wholly or partly be lined by epithelium and connective tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nuñez-Urrutia S, Figueiredo R, Gay-Escoda C | title = Retrospective clinicopathological study of 418 odontogenic cysts | journal = Medicina Oral, Patologia Oral Y Cirugia Bucal | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = e767-73 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20383117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not to be confused with [[abscess]]es, which are cavities filled with pus. Cysts can cause root resorption of adjacent teeth, tooth mobility and can be associated with mandibular fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Struthers P, Shear M | title = Root resorption by ameloblastomas and cysts of the jaws | journal = International Journal of Oral Surgery | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 128–32 | date = June 1976 | pmid = 820661 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlsen A, Marcussen M | title = Spontaneous fractures of the mandible concept &amp; treatment strategy | journal = Medicina Oral, Patologia Oral Y Cirugia Bucal | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = e88-94 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26636905 | pmc = 765750 | doi = 10.4317/medoral.20716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kouhsoltani M, Mesgarzadeh AH, Moradzadeh Khiavi M | title = Mandibular Fracture Associated with a Dentigerous Cyst: Report of a Case and Literature Review | journal = Journal of Dental Research, Dental Clinics, Dental Prospects | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 193–8 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26697153 | pmc = 4682017 | doi = 10.15171/joddd.2015.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyst would usually require surgical management if indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Contemporary Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery | date = 2008 | publisher = Mosby Elsevier | last1 = Hupp | first1 = James R. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = Edward | last3 = Tucker | first3 = Myron R. | name-list-format = vanc | isbn = 978-0-323-04903-0 | edition = 5th | location = St. Louis, Mo. | oclc = 187293319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-extraction pain and infection, or dry socket ===

Following a tooth extraction, if a blood clot forms inadequately in the socket or it is broken down, a painful infection may develop which is often referred to as a ‘[[dry socket]]’. It is clinically characterized by a putrid odor and intense pain that radiates to the ear and neck. Pain is considered the most important symptom of dry socket. It can vary in frequency and intensity, and other symptoms, such as headache, insomnia, and dizziness, can be present.&lt;ref name="pmid20537783"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cardoso CL, Rodrigues MT, Ferreira Júnior O, Garlet GP, de Carvalho PS | title = Clinical concepts of dry socket | journal = Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery | volume = 68 | issue = 8 | pages = 1922–32 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20537783 | doi = 10.1016/j.joms.2009.09.085 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pre-disposing factors to dry socket include smoking, traumatic extraction, history of radiotherapy and bisphosphonate medication.
A dry socket can be managed by irrigating the socket with chlorhexidine or warmed saline to remove debris followed by dressing of the socket with bismuth iodoform paraffin paste and lidocaine gel on ribbon gauze to protect the socket from painful stimuli.&lt;ref name="Greenwood_2012"/&gt;
If pus is seen in the socket and there is localised swelling and possibly lymphadenopathy, it has become infected and can often be managed as in dry
socket, but usually antibiotics should be prescribed. A radiograph is useful to see if there is a retained root or bony sequestrum, which could be the cause of the infection. Clearly, if one or both is present, further treatment is indicated.&lt;ref name="Greenwood_2012"/&gt;

=== Postoperative swelling ===

Mild inflammatory swelling may follow dental extractions but is unusual unless the procedure was difficult and significant surgical trauma occurred. More significant swelling usually indicates postoperative infection or presence of a [[Hematoma|haematoma]]. Management of infection may require systemic antibiotics or drainage. A large haematoma may need to be drained.

== Orthodontic emergencies ==
Orthodontic emergencies can be classified as urgent problems relating to the maintenance of orthodontic appliances, or excessive pain caused by orthodontic appliances. General dental practitioners should be able to manage orthodontic emergencies, including referral to an orthodontist when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones K, Popat H, Johnson IG | title = Dental students' experiences of treating orthodontic emergencies - a qualitative assessment of student reflections | journal = European Journal of Dental Education | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 156–60 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27404001 | pmc = 5033032 | doi = 10.1111/eje.12155 | url = http://orca.cf.ac.uk/89329/1/Jones_et_al-2016-European_Journal_of_Dental_Education.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loose removable appliance ===

Removable active appliance are used by dentist to tip teeth using screws, springs and bows of various types  to correct malocclusion. The appliance can be taken out for cleaning  and for adjustments made by orthodontists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = An introduction to orthodontics | first1 = Laura | last1 = Mitchell | first2 = Nigel E. | last2 = Carter | first3 = Bridget | last3 = Doubleday | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2001 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-263184-8 | edition = 2nd | location = New York | oclc = 44927149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the appliance is loose in an emergency situation,  the dentist can adjust the retentive component of the appliance to increase the retention of the appliance by using Adams pliers.

=== Fractured removable appliance ===

Suppose the appliance  breaks,  the orthodontist should be alerted  as soon as possible. The wearer should not  use the appliance as it could cause trauma  and could pose a  significant risk of airway obstruction if the wearer accidentally inhales.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.orthodontics.ie/patient-information/orthodontic-emergencies/ | title = Orthodontic Emergencies | publisher = Orthodontic Society of Ireland | access-date = 2018-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loose or fractured fixed appliance (wire or band) ===

There are many components to the fixed appliance  which have a potential to break off if the patient chews on hard or crunchy food.  Wearers should   wear a mouth  guard over the appliance if  when playing contact sports.  If one of the components is loose or comes off,  the user must call the orthodontist right away.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the component  is loose the dentist as an emergency  treatment can  cover the  component with orthodontic relief wax.  If the component  breaks off,then the dentist can use   a pair of tweezers to  remove it  making sure to protect the  airway   at all times.

=== Loose or Lost Ligature ===

[[Elastics (orthodontics)|Ligatures]] are small elastics or wires which aim to secure the [[Orthodontic archwires|archwire]] firmly within the brackets on the teeth. If a ligature becomes loose or lost, this can render the appliance less effective as the forces on that particular tooth are reduced. In this case, a loose elastic can be re-positioned with tweezers, ideally by an orthodontist however general dental practitioners are also able to do so. If a wire ligature becomes loose, it should be secured or replaced only by a trained orthodontist and in the meantime, if causing irritation, orthodontic relief wax should be used over any sharp ends. The patient should avoid replacing the wire ligature themselves if it is lost and should seek an appointment with their orthodontist.&lt;ref name="Sodipo_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sodipo I, Birdsall J | title = Orthodontic First Aid for General Dental Practitioners | journal = Dental Update | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 461–2, 465–6, 469–71 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27529914 | doi = | url = https://www.dental-update.co.uk/issueArticle.asp?aKey=1540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lost separator/spacer ===

[[File:Orthodontic spacer removal.jpg|thumb|Separator found between posterior teeth]]
[[Orthodontic spacer|Separators]], also known as orthodontic spacers, are usually placed between posterior teeth to open up contact point prior to placing metal orthodontic bands. The separators should ideally be kept in place until the patient's next appointment in order for the orthodontic band to fit. If the separator is lost, the orthodontist should be informed and he/she can advise for a next appointment for the patient.

=== Protruding archwires ===

The [[Orthodontic archwires|archwire]] in fixed orthodontic appliances should be flat against the tooth, however if the wire is protruding it can cause irritation to the surrounding soft tissues. Wire benders or a dental flat plastic can be used to bend the wire into place, or if this is not possible, the protruding wire can be covered with wax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aso.org.au/troubleshooting-possible-orthodontic-issues|title=Troubleshooting possible orthodontic issues - Australian Society of Orthodontists|website=www.aso.org.au|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there are significant problems, the wire can be clipped using distal end cutters, being careful to avoid inhaling or ingesting wire fragments. As a last resort measure, the whole wire and [[Elastics (orthodontics)|ligatures]] can be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsu.edu/asdoh/programs/orthodontics/pdfs/Orthodontic_Emergencies.pdf|title=AAO: Handling Orthodontic Emergencies|last=|first=|date=2018-02-28|website=|publisher=American Association of Orthodontics.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== De-bonded bracket ===

De-bonded brackets, if left untreated, can result in irritation of lip and cheek in short term. If a bracket de-bonds from the tooth, the de-bonded bracket can be removed from the archwire by initially removing the ligature holding it in place. Alternatively, orthodontic wax relief can be used to secure the de-bonded bracket to the adjacent bracket as a temporary measure to prevent irritation of lip and cheek. However, it is essential to inform the orthodontist as soon as possible so that appropriate actions are taken to address the de-bonded brackets immediately.

=== Allergic/hypersensitivity reactions ===

The most common allergy in orthodontics is to nickel. Nickel is found in multiple orthodontic components, such as nickel-titanium (NiTi) archwires and stainless steel brackets. If patients are previously exposed to nickel, for example with nickel-containing jewellery, the re-exposure with orthodontic components are more likely to lead to a Type IV delayed hypersensitivity immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerosuo H, Kullaa A, Kerosuo E, Kanerva L, Hensten-Pettersen A | title = Nickel allergy in adolescents in relation to orthodontic treatment and piercing of ears | journal = American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics | volume = 109 | issue = 2 | pages = 148–54 | date = February 1996 | pmid = 8638560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This response is usually delayed for a few days or weeks. In this case, the orthodontist must be informed immediately to make arrangements for patient to receive nickel-free components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakravarthi S, Padmanabhan S, Chitharanjan AB | title = Allergy and orthodontics | journal = Journal of Orthodontic Science | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 83–7 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 24987632 | pmc = 4072366 | doi = 10.4103/2278-0203.105871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such immune response to nickel is rare, as it is believed that the oral mucosa requires a much higher concentration to illicit a response compared to the skin.

=== Airway obstruction ===

When a small removable appliance or a loose component obstructs a patients airway a true medical emergency arises. If the object is visible, recline the patient and attempt to remove it while otherwise encouraging the patient to cough the object out. If this is not immediately successful call for help and an ambulance.&lt;ref name="Sodipo_2016" /&gt; Follow the guidelines for 'choking/aspiration' in the 'Medical Emergencies and Resuscitation' document provided by the Resuscitation Council UK.

=== Ingested or aspirated component ===

It is not unheard of to ingest an orthodontic component or appliance, usually being asymptomatic causing no harm to the patient. No treatment is required except for monitoring stools to ensure the component has passed safely. If however the patient is having symptoms of pain or vomiting, the component may be lodged in the oesophagus or oropharynx. In such situations the patient must be sent to hospital.

If the component is more than 5&amp;nbsp;cm long the patient should always be sent to A&amp;E as there is a higher risk of obstruction or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract so removal may be advised instead of allowing the component to pass naturally.&lt;ref name="Sodipo_2016" /&gt; When sending a patient to hospital the referral letter must contain details regarding the components size, shape, flexibility, radio-opacity as well as information about the incident for example when it was swallowed.&lt;ref name="Sodipo_2016" /&gt;

Aspiration of an orthodontic component which was unable to be removed must be referred to A&amp;E for chest radiographs and subsequent removal of the component. The referral letter again must include details as described above.&lt;ref name="Sodipo_2016" /&gt;

==Treatments==
The treatment is cause-related. For example, [[oil of cloves]], which contains [[eugenol]], can be used to treat dental pain; a drop  can be applied with a cotton swab as a [[palliative]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergencies at Missouri City Dentistry|url=https://www.missouricitydentistry.net/emergencies/|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[wisdom teeth|wisdom tooth]] extraction, for example, a condition known as [[dry socket]] can develop where nerve endings are exposed to air.  A piece of sterile gauze or cotton soaked in oil of cloves may be placed in the socket after careful cleaning with [[saline (medicine)|saline]] to relieve this form of pain .{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[Over-the-counter drug|Over-the-counter]] [[topical anesthetic]]s containing [[active ingredient]]s such as [[benzocaine]] or [[choline]] [[salicylate]] may be applied directly to the gum in order to deaden sensation.

[[Analgesics]] such as  [[aspirin]], [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) and [[ibuprofen]] are also commonly used; aspirin and ibuprofen have the additional benefits of being [[anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatories]].  Ice and/or heat are also frequently applied .{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  A [[dentist]] may prescribe an anti-inflammatory [[corticosteroid]] such as  Dexameth for pain relief prior to treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1652">'''Eforia Spitalelor Civile''' ({{lang-en|Board of Civil Hospitals}}) was a non-profit organization which managed hospitals in [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]. Created by general [[Pavel Kiselyov]] in 1832, the organization survived until 1948, when it was abolished by the communist authorities. Initially, by General Kiselyov's decree of April 2, 1832, the board had the authority of managing the Colţea, Pantelimon and Filantropia hospitals in Bucharest. In the course of time, it created and managed other hospitals, mainly in Walachia, but also in Moldova.

The Board was reorganized on October 2, 1864, when new legislation required the board's budget to be submitted to [[parliament]]'s approval and that the accounting be done according to government regulations and subject of the control of the [[Court of Accounts]] ("Curtea de conturi").

To finance the hospitals, the board had been endowed with land property, a significant part located in the territories of the former Turkish [[raya (country subdivision)|raya]]s. By 1921 it had a property of tens of thousands hectares of farm land and over 50,000 hectares of forests. After the agrarian reform of the 1920s, the Board retained its right on the payments for oil extraction from its former properties. The board also owned several important buildings in Bucharest and several hotels in Sinaia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capital.ro/articole/eforia-spitalelor-civile/106097 Adrian Majuru - ''Eforia Spitalelor Civile'' - Capital, December 5, 2007 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6979">The '''Ferber method''', or '''Ferberization''', is a technique invented by Dr. [[Richard Ferber]] to solve infant [[insomnia|sleep problems]]. It involves "baby-training" children to self-soothe by allowing the child to cry for a predetermined amount of time before receiving external comfort.

=="Cry it out"==
The "Cry It Out" (CIO) approach can be traced back to the book "The Care and Feeding of Children" written by Dr. [[Emmett Holt]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15484 The Care and Feeding of Children: A Catechism for the Use of Mothers and Children's Nurses] (1907 edition) by Dr. Holt, L. Emmett, MD&lt;/ref&gt; CIO is any sleep-training method which allows a baby to cry for a specified period before the parent will offer comfort. "Ferberization" is one such approach.  Ferber does not advocate simply leaving a baby to cry. More extreme methods, such as Dr. [[Marc Weissbluth]]'s extinction method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weissbluth|first1=Marc|title=Healthy sleep habits, happy child : a step-by-step program for a good night's sleep|date=2005|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=9780345486455|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} are often mistakenly referred to as "Ferberization", though they fall outside of the guidelines Ferber recommended. Some pediatricians,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nospank.net/fleiss2.htm Mistaken Approaches to Night Waking Excerpt from Sweet Dreams: A pediatrician's secrets for your child's good night sleep] Lowell House, 22–28 By Paul M. Fleiss, MD, MPH, FAAP, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; however, feel that any form of CIO is unnecessary and damaging to a baby.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, William MD, et al., ''The Baby Sleep Book'', Little, Brown and Company, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dangers of ‘Crying It Out’ |date=December 11, 2011 |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201112/dangers-crying-it-out }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

==Ferberization summarized==
Dr. [[Richard Ferber]] discusses and outlines a wide range of practices to teach an infant to sleep. The term ''ferberization'' is now popularly used to refer to the following techniques:

* Take steps to prepare the baby to sleep. This includes night-time rituals and day-time activities.
* At bedtime, leave the child in bed and leave the room.
* Return at progressively increasing intervals to comfort the baby (without picking him or her up). For example, on the first night, some scenarios call for returning first after three minutes, then after five minutes, and thereafter each ten minutes, until the baby is asleep.
* Each subsequent night, return at intervals longer than the night before. For example, the second night may call for returning first after five minutes, then after ten minutes, and thereafter each twelve minutes, until the baby is asleep.

The technique is targeted at infants as young as four months of age. A few babies are capable of sleeping through the night at three months, and most are capable of sleeping through the night at six months. Before six months of age, the baby may still need to feed during the night and it is probable that the baby will require a night feeding before three months.

Ferber made some modifications in the 2006 edition of his book ''Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems''. He is now more open to [[co-sleeping]] and feels different approaches work for different families, children &amp; situations.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Seabrook]]. Sleeping with the baby. [[The New Yorker]], November 8, 1999. [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1999/11/08/1999_11_08_056_TNY_LIBRY_000019468 abstract The New Yorker archive], [http://www.booknoise.net/johnseabrook/stories/self/baby/ full article booknoise.net] – includes interview with Dr. Ferber. "There's plenty of examples of co-sleeping where it works out just fine. My feeling now is that children can sleep with or without their parents.

Crying is associated with physiological stress in the baby in the short term, and some pediatricians do not recommend techniques like "controlled crying" and "camping out" as a result, based on possible long-term psychological and physical problems.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=NHS /&gt;--&gt; A study that looked at long-term consequences in children older than seven months concluded that there were no beneficial nor negative effects.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=NHS /&gt;--&gt; However, there are no data on children younger than seven months.&lt;ref name=NHS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2012/09September/Pages/Controlled-crying-safe-for-babies.aspx|title=Controlled crying 'safe for babies'|author=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Co-sleeping]], a common alternative, has its own benefits but also risks if not breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=NHSsharedbeds&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2009/10october/pages/cot-death-and-shared-beds.aspx|title=Cot death and shared beds|author=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving babies to cry without comfort causes a rise in a hormone called cortisol, a stress hormone. Prolonged increases in this hormone inhibit brain and emotional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parents Misled by Cry-It-Out Sleep Training Reports |date=July 20, 2014 |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201407/parents-misled-cry-it-out-sleep-training-reports }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause of most cases is unclear.&lt;ref name=WCR2014,5.16&gt;{{cite book|title=World Cancer Report 2014|date=2014|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-9283204299|chapter=Chapter 5.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncommon risk factors include [[genetic disorder]]s such as [[neurofibromatosis]] and [[Li–Fraumeni syndrome]], and previous [[radiation therapy]].&lt;ref name=WCR2014,5.16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal2015/&gt; Glioblastomas represent 15% of [[brain tumor]]s.&lt;ref name=Young2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=RM|last2=Jamshidi|first2=A|last3=Davis|first3=G|last4=Sherman|first4=JH|title=Current trends in the surgical management and treatment of adult glioblastoma.|journal=Annals of Translational Medicine|date=June 2015|volume=3|issue=9|page=121|pmid=26207249|doi=10.3978/j.issn.2305-5839.2015.05.10|pmc=4481356}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can either start from normal brain cells or develop from an existing [[low-grade astrocytoma]].&lt;ref name=WCR2014,3.8&gt;{{cite book|title=World Cancer Report 2014|date=2014|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-9283204299|chapter=Chapter 3.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis typically is made by a combination of [[CT scan]], [[MRI scan]], and [[tissue biopsy]].&lt;ref name=Young2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention, treatment and prognosis --&gt;
There is no clear way to prevent the disease.&lt;ref name=Gal2015/&gt; Typically, treatment involves [[surgery]], after which [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation therapy]] are used.&lt;ref name=Gal2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallego|first1=O|title=Nonsurgical treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.|journal=Current Oncology (Toronto, Ont.)|date=August 2015|volume=22|issue=4|pages=e273–81|pmid=26300678|doi=10.3747/co.22.2436|pmc=4530825}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medication [[temozolomide]] is used frequently as part of chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=Gal2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="RTG1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=MG|last2=Garside|first2=R|last3=Rogers|first3=G|last4=Stein|first4=K|last5=Grant|first5=R|title=Temozolomide for high grade glioma.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=30 April 2013|volume=4|issue=4|pages=CD007415|pmid=23633341|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007415.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; High dose [[corticosteroids|steroids]] may be used to help reduce swelling and decrease symptoms.&lt;ref name=Young2015/&gt; It is unclear whether trying to remove all or simply most of the cancer is better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3322/caac.20069 |title=Exciting New Advances in Neuro-Oncology: The Avenue to a Cure for Malignant Glioma |year=2010 |last1=Van Meir |first1=E.

&lt;!-- Prognosis, epidemiology, and research --&gt;
Despite maximum treatment, the cancer usually recurs.&lt;ref name=Gal2015/&gt; The most common length of survival following diagnosis is 12 to 15 months, with fewer than 3% to 5% of people surviving longer than five years.&lt;ref name=WCR2014,5.16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal2015/&gt; Without treatment, survival is typically three months.&lt;ref name=Sch2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schapira|first1=Anthony H.V.|title=Neurology and clinical neuroscience|date=2007|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780323070539|page=1336|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=EwajBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1336|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729005047/https://books.google.ca/books?id=EwajBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1336|archivedate=2017-07-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most common cancer that begins within the brain and the second most common brain tumor, after [[meningioma]].&lt;ref name=Ble2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mc2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McNeill|first=Katharine A.|title=Epidemiology of Brain Tumors|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0733861916300366|journal=Neurologic Clinics|volume=34|issue=4|pages=981–98|doi=10.1016/j.ncl.2016.06.014|pmid=27720005|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 3 per 100,000 people develop the disease a year.&lt;ref name=Gal2015/&gt; It most often begins around 64 years of age and occurs more commonly in males than females.&lt;ref name=WCR2014,5.16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal2015/&gt; [[Immunotherapy]] is being studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With Immunotherapy, Glimmers of Progress against Glioblastoma|url=http://www.cancer.gov/types/brain/research/immunotherapy-glioblastoma|website=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=23 December 2015|date=9 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224103950/http://www.cancer.gov/types/brain/research/immunotherapy-glioblastoma|archivedate=24 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Common symptoms include [[seizure]], [[headache]]s, [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[memory loss]], changes to personality, mood or concentration; and localized neurological problems.&lt;ref name=Al2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alifieris|first1=C|last2=Trafalis|first2=DT|title=Glioblastoma multiforme: Pathogenesis and treatment.|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|date=August 2015|volume=152|pages=63–82|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2015.05.005|pmid=25944528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kind of symptoms produced depends more on the location of the tumor than on its pathological properties. The tumor can start producing symptoms quickly, but occasionally is an [[asymptomatic condition]] until it reaches an enormous size.

==Risk factors==
The cause of most cases is unclear.&lt;ref name=WCR2014,5.16&gt;{{cite book|title=World Cancer Report 2014|date=2014|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-9283204299|chapter=Chapter 5.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 5% develop from another type brain tumor known as a low-grade [[astrocytoma]].&lt;ref name=Al2015/&gt;

===Genetics===
Uncommon risk factors include [[genetic disorder]]s such as [[neurofibromatosis]], [[Li–Fraumeni syndrome]], [[tuberous sclerosis]], or [[Mismatch repair cancer syndrome|Turcot syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Al2015/&gt; Previous [[radiation therapy]] is also a risk.&lt;ref name=WCR2014,5.16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal2015/&gt; For unknown reasons, GBM occurs more commonly in males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15977639 |year=2005 |last1=Ohgaki |first1=Hiroko |last2=Kleihues |first2=Paul |title=Population-Based Studies on Incidence, Survival Rates, and Genetic Alterations in Astrocytic and Oligodendroglial Gliomas |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=479–89 |journal=Journal of Neuropathology &amp; Experimental Neurology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===
Other associations include exposure to [[smoking]], [[pesticide]]s, and working in [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]] or [[Synthetic rubber|rubber manufacturing]].&lt;ref name=Al2015/&gt;

==Pathogenesis==

The cellular origin of glioblastoma is unknown.  Because of the similarities in [[immunostaining]] of [[glial cell]]s and glioblastoma, it has long been assumed that gliomas such as glioblastoma originate from glial type cells.  However more recent studies suggest that [[astrocyte]]s, [[oligodendrocyte]] progenitor cells and [[neural stem cell]]s could also serve as the cell of origin.&lt;ref name="Zong_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zong H, Verhaak RG, Canoll P | title = The cellular origin for malignant glioma and prospects for clinical advancements | journal = Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 383–94 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22616703 | pmc = 3368274 | doi = 10.1586/erm.12.30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zong_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zong H, Parada LF, Baker SJ | title = Cell of origin for malignant gliomas and its implication in therapeutic development | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = a020610 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25635044 | pmc = 4448618 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a020610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glioblastoma multiforme tumors are characterized by the presence of small areas of [[Necrosis|necrotizing]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] that are surrounded by [[anaplastic]] cells. This characteristic, as well as the presence of [[hyperplastic]] blood vessels, differentiates the tumor from Grade 3 [[astrocytomas]], which do not have these features.

GBMs usually form in the cerebral white matter, grow quickly, and can become very large before producing symptoms. Fewer than 10% form more slowly following degeneration of [[Fibrillary astrocytoma|low-grade astrocytoma]] or [[anaplastic astrocytoma]]. These are called secondary GBMs and are more common in younger patients (mean age 45 versus 62 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01308.x |title=Genetic alterations and signaling pathways in the evolution of gliomas |year=2009 |last1=Ohgaki |first1=Hiroko |last2=Kleihues |first2=Paul |journal=Cancer Science |volume=100 |issue=12 |pages=2235–41 |pmid=19737147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tumor may extend into the meninges or [[Ventricular system|ventricular]] wall, leading to high protein content in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) (&gt; 100&amp;nbsp;mg/dL), as well as an occasional [[pleocytosis]] of 10 to 100 cells, mostly [[lymphocyte]]s. [[Malignant]] cells carried in the CSF may spread (rarely) to the [[spinal cord]] or cause meningeal gliomatosis. However, [[metastasis]] of GBM beyond the [[central nervous system]] is extremely unusual. About 50% of GBMs occupy more than one lobe of a hemisphere or are bilateral. Tumors of this type usually arise from the [[cerebrum]] and may  exhibit the classic infiltration across the [[corpus callosum]], producing a butterfly (bilateral) [[glioma]].

The tumor may take on a variety of appearances, depending on the amount of hemorrhage, [[necrosis]], or its age. A CT scan will usually show an inhomogeneous mass with a hypodense center and a variable [[Ring-enhancing lesion|ring of enhancement]] surrounded by [[edema]]. [[Mass effect (medicine)|Mass effect]] from the tumor and edema may compress the ventricles and cause [[hydrocephalus]].

===Molecular alterations===
Four subtypes of glioblastoma have been identified:&lt;ref name=Roel2010&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Roel G.

* Classical: Ninety-seven percent of tumors in the 'classical' subtype carry extra copies of the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR) gene, and most have higher than normal expression of [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR), whereas the gene [[TP53]] (p53), which is often mutated in glioblastoma, is rarely mutated in this subtype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/463278a |title=Genomics boosts brain-cancer work |year=2010 |last1=Hayden |first1=Erika Check |journal=Nature |volume=463 |issue=7279 |pages=278 |pmid=20090720}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loss of heterozygosity]] (LOH) in chromosome 10 is also frequently seen in the classical subtype alongside chromosome 7 amplification.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sasmita|first=Andrew Octavian|last2=Wong|first2=Ying Pei|last3=Ling|first3=Anna Pick Kiong|date=2018-02-01|title=Biomarkers and therapeutic advances in glioblastoma multiforme|journal=Asia-Pacific Journal of Clinical Oncology|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=40–51|doi=10.1111/ajco.12756|pmid=28840962}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The Proneural subtype often has high rates of alterations in TP53 (p53), and in PDGFRA, the gene encoding a-type [[platelet-derived growth factor receptor]], and in IDH1, the gene encoding [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]]-1. 
*The Mesenchymal subtype is characterized by high rates of mutations or other alterations in NF1, the gene encoding [[Neurofibromin 1]] and fewer alterations in the EGFR gene and less expression of EGFR than other types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.236 |title=Genomics Illuminates a Deadly Brain Cancer |year=2010 |last1=Kuehn |first1=Bridget M. |journal=JAMA |volume=303 |issue=10 |pages=925–27 |pmid=20215599}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The Neural subtype was typified by the expression of neuron markers such as [[NEFL]], [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1|GABRA1]], [[synaptotagmin|SYT1]] and [[Chloride potassium symporter 5|SLC12A5]], while often presenting themselves as normal cells upon pathological assessment.&lt;ref name=Roel2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many other genetic alterations have been described in glioblastoma, and the majority of them are clustered in two pathways, the [[retinoblastoma protein|RB]] and the [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway|PI3K/AKT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bleeker|first1=FE |last2=Lamba|first2=S |last3=Zanon|first3=C |last4=Molenaar|first4=RJ |last5=Hulsebos|first5=TJ |last6=Troost|first6=D|last7=van Tilborg|first7=AA |last8=Vandertop|first8=WP|last9=Leenstra|first9=S|last10=van Noorden|first10=CJ|last11=Bardelli|first11=A|title=Mutational profiling of kinases in glioblastoma.|journal=BMC Cancer|date=26 September 2014|volume=14|page=718|pmid=25256166|pmc=4192443 |doi=10.1186/1471-2407-14-718|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glioblastomas have alterations in 68–78% and 88% of these pathways, respectively.&lt;ref name=Ble2012/&gt;

Another important alteration is methylation of [[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|MGMT]], a "suicide" DNA repair enzyme. Methylation is described to impair DNA transcription and therefore, expression of the MGMT enzyme. Since an MGMT enzyme can repair only one DNA alkylation due to its suicide repair mechanism, reverse capacity is low and methylation of the [[MGMT promoter|MGMT gene promoter]] greatly affects DNA-repair capacity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Molenaar|first1=RJ |last2=Verbaan|first2=D |last3=Lamba|first3=S |last4=Zanon|first4=C |last5=Jeuken|first5=JW|last6=Boots-Sprenger|first6=SH |last7=Wesseling|first7=P |last8=Hulsebos|first8=TJ|last9=Troost|first9=D|last10=van Tilborg|first10=AA |last11=Leenstra|first11=S |last12=Vandertop|first12=WP|last13=Bardelli|first13=A|last14=van Noorden|first14=CJ|last15=Bleeker|first15=FE|title=The combination of IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation status predicts survival in glioblastoma better than either IDH1 or MGMT alone.|journal=Neuro-oncology|date=September 2014|volume=16|issue=9|pages=1263–73|pmid=24510240|doi=10.1093/neuonc/nou005|pmc=4136888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molenaar|first1=RJ|last2=Radivoyevitch|first2=T|last3=Maciejewski|first3=JP|last4=van Noorden|first4=CJ|last5=Bleeker|first5=FE|title=The driver and passenger effects of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 mutations in oncogenesis and survival prolongation.|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date=28 May 2014|volume=1846|issue=2|pages=326–41 |pmid=24880135 |doi=10.1016/j.bbcan.2014.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, MGMT methylation is associated with an improved response to treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, such as temozolomide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa043331 |title=''MGMT'' Gene Silencing and Benefit from Temozolomide in Glioblastoma |year=2005 |last1=Hegi |first1=Monika E. |last2=Diserens |first2=Annie-Claire |last3=Gorlia |first3=Thierry |last4=Hamou |first4=Marie-France |last5=De Tribolet |first5=Nicolas |last6=Weller |first6=Michael |last7=Kros |first7=Johan M. |last8=Hainfellner |first8=Johannes A. |last9=Mason |first9=Warren |last10=Mariani |first10=Luigi |last11=Bromberg |first11=Jacoline E.C. |last12=Hau |first12=Peter |last13=Mirimanoff |first13=René O. |last14=Cairncross |first14=J.

===Glioblastoma stem-like cells===
Cancer cells with properties similar to stem cells have been found in glioblastomas (this may be a cause of their resistance to conventional treatments, and high recurrence rate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1200/JCO.2007.15.7164 |title=Stem Cell-Related 'Self-Renewal' Signature and High Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Expression Associated with Resistance to Concomitant Chemoradiotherapy in Glioblastoma |year=2008 |last1=Murat |first1=A. |last2=Migliavacca |first2=E. |last3=Gorlia |first3=T. |last4=Lambiv |first4=W.

===Metabolism===
The ''IDH1'' gene encodes for the enzyme [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]] 1 and is frequently mutated in glioblastoma (primary GBM: 5%, secondary GBM &gt;80%).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; By producing very high concentrations of the "oncometabolite" D-2-hydroxyglutarate and dysregulating the function of the wild-type IDH1-enzyme it induces profound changes to the metabolism of ''IDH1''-mutated glioblastoma, compared with ''IDH1'' wild-type glioblastoma or healthy astrocytes. Among others, it increases the glioblastoma cells' dependence on [[glutamine]] or [[glutamate]] as an energy source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Lith|first1=SA|last2=Navis|first2=AC|last3=Verrijp|first3=K|last4=Niclou|first4=SP|last5=Bjerkvig|first5=R|last6=Wesseling|first6=P|last7=Tops|first7=B|last8=Molenaar|first8=R|last9=van Noorden|first9=CJ|last10=Leenders|first10=WP|title=Glutamate as chemotactic fuel for diffuse glioma cells: are they glutamate suckers?|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date=August 2014|volume=1846|issue=1|pages=66–74|pmid=24747768|doi=10.1016/j.bbcan.2014.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized that ''IDH1''-mutated glioblastoma are in a very high demand for glutamate and use this amino acid and neurotransmitter as a chemotactic signal. Since healthy astrocytes excrete glutamate, ''IDH1''-mutated glioblastoma cells do not favor dense tumor structures but instead migrate, invade and disperse into healthy parts of the brain where glutamate concentrations are higher. This may explain the invasive behaviour of these ''IDH1''-mutated glioblastoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Lith|first1=SA|last2=Molenaar|first2=R|last3=van Noorden|first3=CJ|last4=Leenders|first4=WP|title=Tumor cells in search for glutamate: an alternative explanation for increased invasiveness of IDH1 mutant gliomas.|journal=Neuro-oncology|date=December 2014|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1669–70|pmid=25074540|doi=10.1093/neuonc/nou152|pmc=4232089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ion channels===
Furthermore, glioblastoma multiforme exhibits numerous alterations in genes that encode for ion channels, including upregulation of gBK potassium channels and ClC-3 chloride channels. It has been hypothesized that by upregulating these ion channels, glioblastoma tumor cells can facilitate increased ion movement over the cell membrane, thereby increasing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O movement through osmosis, which aids glioblastoma cells in changing cellular volume very rapidly. This is helpful in their extremely aggressive invasive behavior, because quick adaptations in cellular volume can facilitate movement through the sinuous extracellular matrix of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5402/2011/590249 |title=Ion Channels in Glioblastoma |year=2011 |last1=Molenaar |first1=Remco J. |journal=ISRN Neurology |volume=2011 |pages=1–7 |pmid=22389824 |pmc=3263536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:BrainCAConMark.png|thumb|GBM in the frontal right lobe as seen on CT scan]]
[[File:Glioblastoma  - MR sagittal with contrast.jpg|thumb|Sagittal [[MRI]] with contrast of a glioblastoma WHO grade IV in a 15-year-old boy.]]
[[File:Glioblastoma (1).jpg|thumb|Glioblastoma (histology slide)]]
When viewed with [[MRI]], glioblastomas often appear as ring-enhancing lesions.  The appearance is not specific, however, as other lesions such as [[abscess]], [[metastasis]], [[tumefactive multiple sclerosis]], and other entities may have a similar appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1148/rg.272065155 |title=From the Archives of the AFIP: Patterns of Contrast Enhancement in the Brain and Meninges |year=2007 |last1=Smirniotopoulos |first1=J. G. |last2=Murphy |first2=F. M. |last3=Rushing |first3=E. J. |last4=Rees |first4=J. H. |last5=Schroeder |first5=J. W. |journal=Radiographics |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=525–51 |pmid=17374867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definitive diagnosis of a suspected GBM on CT or MRI requires a [[stereotactic biopsy]] or a [[craniotomy]] with tumor resection and pathologic confirmation.  Because the tumor grade is based upon the most malignant portion of the tumor, biopsy or subtotal tumor resection can result in undergrading of the lesion. Imaging of tumor blood flow using perfusion MRI and measuring tumor metabolite concentration with [[In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy|MR spectroscopy]] may add value to standard MRI in select cases by showing increased relative cerebral blood volume and increased choline peak respectively, but pathology remains the gold standard for diagnosis and molecular characterization.

It is important to distinguish primary glioblastoma from secondary glioblastoma. These tumors occur spontaneously (''de novo'') or have progressed from a lower-grade glioma, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bleeker|first1=FE|last2=Molenaar|first2=RJ|last3=Leenstra|first3=S|title=Recent advances in the molecular understanding of glioblastoma.|journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology|date=May 2012|volume=108|issue=1|pages=11–27|pmid=22270850|doi=10.1007/s11060-011-0793-0|pmc=3337398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary glioblastomas have a worse prognosis, different tumor biology and may have a different response to therapy, which makes this a critical evaluation to determine patient prognosis and therapy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Over 80% of secondary glioblastoma carries a mutation in ''IDH1'', whereas this mutation is rare in primary glioblastoma (5–10%). Thus, ''IDH1'' mutations are a useful tool to distinguish primary and secondary glioblastomas  since histopathologically they are very similar and the distinction without molecular biomarkers is unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=24880135 | doi=10.1016/j.bbcan.2014.05.004 | volume=1846 | issue=2 | title=The driver and passenger effects of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 mutations in oncogenesis and survival prolongation. | date=Dec 2014 | journal=Biochim Biophys Acta | pages=326–41 | last1 = Molenaar | first1 = RJ | last2 = Radivoyevitch | first2 = T | last3 = Maciejewski | first3 = JP | last4 = van Noorden | first4 = CJ | last5 = Bleeker | first5 = FE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
It is very difficult to treat glioblastoma due to several complicating factors:&lt;ref name = "pmid12672279"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11060-006-9303-1 |title=Interstitial chemotherapy for malignant gliomas: The Johns Hopkins experience |year=2006 |last1=Lawson |first1=H. Christopher |last2=Sampath |first2=Prakash |last3=Bohan |first3=Eileen |last4=Park |first4=Michael C. |last5=Hussain |first5=Namath |last6=Olivi |first6=Alessandro |last7=Weingart |first7=Jon |last8=Kleinberg |first8=Lawrence |last9=Brem |first9=Henry |journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology |volume=83 |pages=61–70 |pmid=17171441 |issue=1 |pmc=4086528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The tumor cells are very resistant to conventional therapies.
* The brain is susceptible to damage from conventional therapy.
* The brain has a very limited capacity to repair itself.
* Many drugs cannot cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] to act on the tumor.

Treatment of primary brain tumors and brain metastases consists of both symptomatic
and palliative therapies.

===Symptomatic therapy===
Supportive treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and improving the patient’s
neurologic function. The primary supportive agents are [[anticonvulsant]]s and
[[corticosteroid]]s.

*Historically, around 90% of patients with glioblastoma underwent anticonvulsant treatment, although it has been estimated that only approximately 40% of patients required this treatment. Recently, it has been recommended that neurosurgeons not administer anticonvulsants prophylactically, and should wait until a seizure occurs before prescribing this medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11910-006-0024-9 |title=Antiepileptic therapy in patients with central nervous system malignancies |year=2006 |last1=Stevens |first1=Glen H. J. |journal=Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=311–18 |pmid=16822352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those receiving [[phenytoin]] concurrent with radiation may have serious skin reactions such as [[erythema multiforme]] and [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]].
*Corticosteroids, usually [[dexamethasone]] given 4 to 8&amp;nbsp;mg every 4 to 6 h, can reduce peritumoral edema (through rearrangement of the blood–brain barrier), diminishing mass effect and lowering intracranial pressure, with a decrease in headache or drowsiness.

===Palliative therapy===
Palliative treatment usually is conducted to improve quality of life and to achieve a longer survival time. It includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A maximally feasible resection with maximal tumor-free margins is usually performed along with external beam [[radiation]] and [[chemotherapy]].  Gross total resection of tumor is associated with a better prognosis.

====Surgery====
Surgery is the first stage of treatment of glioblastoma. An average GBM tumor contains 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; cells, which is on average reduced to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cells after surgery (a reduction of 99%).
Benefits of surgery include resection for a pathological diagnosis, alleviation of symptoms related to mass effect, and potentially removing disease before secondary resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy occurs.

The greater the extent of tumor removal, the better. Removal of 98% or more of the tumor has been associated with a significantly longer healthier time than if less than 98% of the tumor is removed in retrospective analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3171/jns.2001.95.2.0190 |title=A multivariate analysis of 416 patients with glioblastoma multiforme: Prognosis, extent of resection, and survival |year=2001 |last1=Lacroix |first1=Michel |last2=Abi-Said |first2=Dima |last3=Fourney |first3=Daryl R. |last4=Gokaslan |first4=Ziya L. |last5=Shi |first5=Weiming |last6=Demonte |first6=Franco |last7=Lang |first7=Frederick F. |last8=McCutcheon |first8=Ian E. |last9=Hassenbusch |first9=Samuel J. |last10=Holland |first10=Eric |last11=Hess |first11=Kenneth |last12=Michael |first12=Christopher |last13=Miller |first13=Daniel |last14=Sawaya |first14=Raymond |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |volume=95 |issue=2 |pages=190–98 |pmid=11780887|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chances of near-complete initial removal of the tumor may be increased if the surgery is guided by a fluorescent dye known as [[5-aminolevulinic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(06)70665-9 |title=Fluorescence-guided surgery with 5-aminolevulinic acid for resection of malignant glioma: A randomised controlled multicentre phase III trial |year=2006 |last1=Stummer |first1=Walter |last2=Pichlmeier |first2=Uwe |last3=Meinel |first3=Thomas |last4=Wiestler |first4=Otmar Dieter |last5=Zanella |first5=Friedhelm |last6=Reulen |first6=Hans-Jürgen |journal=The Lancet Oncology |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=392–401 |pmid=16648043 |last7=Ala-Glioma Study |first7=Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; GBM cells are widely infiltrative through the brain at diagnosis, and so despite a "total resection" of all obvious tumor, most people with GBM later develop recurrent tumors either near the original site or at more distant locations within the brain. Other modalities, typically radiation and chemotherapy, are used after surgery in an effort to suppress and slow recurrent disease.

====Radiotherapy====
Subsequent to surgery, radiotherapy becomes the mainstay of treatment for people with glioblastoma. It is typically performed along with giving [[temozolomide]] (TMZ).&lt;ref name="RTG1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khosla|first1=D|title=Concurrent therapy to enhance radiotherapeutic outcomes in glioblastoma.|journal=Annals of Translational Medicine|date=February 2016|volume=4|issue=3|page=54|pmid=26904576|doi=10.3978/j.issn.2305-5839.2016.01.25|pmc=4740000}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pivotal clinical trial carried out in the early 1970s showed that among 303 GBM patients randomized to radiation or nonradiation therapy, those who received radiation had a median survival more than double those who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.3171/jns.1978.49.3.0333 |title= Evaluation of BCNU and/or radiotherapy in the treatment of anaplastic gliomas |year= 1978 |last1= Walker |first1= Michael D. |last2= Alexander |first2= Eben |last3= Hunt |first3= William E. |last4= MacCarty |first4= Collin S. |last5= Mahaley |first5= M.

On average, [[radiotherapy]] after surgery can reduce the tumor size to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Whole-brain radiotherapy does not improve when compared to the more precise and targeted three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.03.045 |title= Multifocal Glioblastoma Multiforme: Prognostic Factors and Patterns of Progression |year= 2007 |last1= Showalter |first1= Timothy N. |last2= Andrel |first2= Jocelyn |last3= Andrews |first3= David W. |last4= Curran |first4= Walter J. |last5= Daskalakis |first5= Constantine |last6= Werner-Wasik |first6= Maria |journal=International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics  |volume= 69 |issue= 3 |pages= 820–24 |pmid= 17499453}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total radiation dose of 60–65 Gy has been found to be optimal for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 1335044 |year= 1992 |last1= Fulton |first1= DS |last2= Urtasun |first2= RC |last3= Scott-Brown |first3= I |last4= Johnson |first4= ES |last5= Mielke |first5= B |last6= Curry |first6= B |last7= Huyser-Wierenga |first7= D |last8= Hanson |first8= J |last9= Feldstein |first9= M |title= Increasing radiation dose intensity using hyperfractionation in patients with malignant glioma.

GBM tumors are well known to contain zones of tissue exhibiting [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] which are highly resistant to radiotherapy.  Various approaches to chemotherapy radiosensitizers have been pursued with limited success {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}}. {{As of | 2010}} newer research approaches included preclinical and clinical investigations into the use of an [[oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound]] such as [[trans sodium crocetinate]] (TSC) as [[radiosensitizer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.2217/fon.10.123 |title= Improving the radiosensitivity of radioresistant and hypoxic glioblastoma |year= 2010 |last1= Sheehan |first1= Jason P |last2= Shaffrey |first2= Mark E |last3= Gupta |first3= Brinda |last4= Larner |first4= James |last5= Rich |first5= Jeremy N |last6= Park |first6= Deric M |journal= Future Oncology |volume= 6 |issue= 10 |pages= 1591–601 |pmid= 21062158}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{as of | 2015| lc = on}} a clinical trial was underway.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boron neutron capture therapy]] has been tested as an alternative treatment for glioblastoma multiforme but is not in common use.

====Chemotherapy====
Most studies show no benefit from the addition of chemotherapy. However, a large clinical trial of 575 participants randomized to standard radiation versus radiation plus [[temozolomide]] chemotherapy showed that the group receiving temozolomide survived a median of 14.6 months as opposed to 12.1 months for the group receiving radiation alone.&lt;ref name="RTG1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa043330 |title=Radiotherapy plus Concomitant and Adjuvant Temozolomide for Glioblastoma |year=2005 |last1=Stupp |first1=Roger |last2=Mason |first2=Warren P. |last3=Van Den Bent |first3=Martin J. |last4=Weller |first4=Michael |last5=Fisher |first5=Barbara |last6=Taphoorn |first6=Martin J.B. |last7=Belanger |first7=Karl |last8=Brandes |first8=Alba A. |last9=Marosi |first9=Christine |last10=Bogdahn |first10=Ulrich |last11=Curschmann |first11=Jürgen |last12=Janzer |first12=Robert C. |last13=Ludwin |first13=Samuel K. |last14=Gorlia |first14=Thierry |last15=Allgeier |first15=Anouk |last16=Lacombe |first16=Denis |last17=Cairncross |first17=J.

==Prognosis==
The most common length of survival following diagnosis is 12 to 15 months, with fewer than 3% to 5% of people surviving longer than five years.&lt;ref name=WCR2014,5.16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal2015/&gt; Without treatment survival is typically 3 months.&lt;ref name=Sch2007/&gt;

Increasing age (&gt; 60 years of age) carries a worse prognostic risk. Death is usually due to widespread tumor infiltration with [[cerebral edema]] and increased [[intracranial pressure]].&lt;ref name="doi101093brainawm204"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/brain/awm204 |title=Long-term survival with glioblastoma multiforme |year=2007 |last1=Krex |first1=D. |last2=Klink |first2=B. |last3=Hartmann |first3=C. |last4=Von Deimling |first4=A. |last5=Pietsch |first5=T. |last6=Simon |first6=M. |last7=Sabel |first7=M. |last8=Steinbach |first8=J.

A good initial [[Karnofsky score|Karnofsky Performance Score]] (KPS) and [[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|MGMT]] [[methylation]] are associated with longer survival.&lt;ref name="doi101093brainawm204"/&gt; A DNA test can be conducted on glioblastomas to determine whether or not the [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] of the ''MGMT'' [[gene]] is [[methylated]]. Patients with a methylated MGMT promoter have longer survival than those with an unmethylated MGMT promoter, due in part to increased sensitivity to temozolomide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11060-006-9292-0 |title=Frequent hypermethylation of the DNA repair gene MGMT in long-term survivors of glioblastoma multiforme |year=2006 |last1=Martinez |first1=Ramon |last2=Schackert |first2=Gabriele |last3=Yaya-Tur |first3=Ricard |last4=Rojas-Marcos |first4=Iñigo |last5=Herman |first5=James G. |last6=Esteller |first6=Manel |journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology |volume=83 |pages=91–3 |pmid=17164975 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This DNA characteristic is intrinsic to the patient and currently cannot be altered externally. Another positive prognostic marker for glioblastoma patients is mutation of the ''[[IDH1]]'' gene,&lt;ref name=Ble2012/&gt; which can be tested by DNA-based methods or by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against the most common mutation, namely IDH1-R132H.&lt;ref name="P2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Preusser M, Wöhrer A, Stary S, Höftberger R, Streubel B, Hainfellner JA | title = Value and limitations of immunohistochemistry and gene sequencing for detection of the IDH1-R132H mutation in diffuse glioma biopsy specimens | journal = J.

More prognostic power can be obtained by combining the mutational status of ''IDH1'' and the methylation status of ''MGMT'' into a two-gene predictor. Patients with both ''IDH1'' mutations and ''MGMT'' methylation have the longest survival, patients with an ''IDH1'' mutation or ''MGMT'' methylation an intermediate survival and patients without either genetic event have the shortest survival.&lt;ref name="pmid24510240"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Molenaar RJ, Verbaan D, Lamba S, Zanon C, Jeuken JW, Boots-Sprenger SH, Wesseling P, Hulsebos TJ, Troost D, van Tilborg AA, Leenstra S, Vandertop WP, Bardelli A, van Noorden CJ, Bleeker FE|display-authors = 6 | title = The combination of IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation status predicts survival in glioblastoma better than either IDH1 or MGMT alone | journal = Neuro-oncology | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 1263–73 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24510240 | pmc = 4136888 | doi = 10.1093/neuonc/nou005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term benefits have also been associated with those patients who receive surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy.&lt;ref name="doi101093brainawm204"/&gt; However, much remains unknown about why some patients survive longer with glioblastoma. Age of under 50 is linked to longer survival in glioblastoma multiforme, as is 98%+ resection and use of temozolomide chemotherapy and better Karnofsky performance scores. A recent study confirms that younger age is associated with a much better prognosis, with a small fraction of patients under 40 years of age achieving a population-based cure. The population-based cure is thought to occur when a population's risk of death returns to that of the normal population, and in GBM, this is thought to occur after 10 years.&lt;ref name="pmid22776797"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smoll NR, Schaller K, Gautschi OP | title = The cure fraction of glioblastoma multiforme | journal = Neuroepidemiology | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–9 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22776797 | doi = 10.1159/000339319  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
About 3 per 100,000 people develop the disease a year.&lt;ref name=Gal2015/&gt; It most often begins around 64 years of age and occurs more commonly in males than females.&lt;ref name=WCR2014,5.16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal2015/&gt; It is the second most common [[central nervous system]] cancer after [[meningioma]].&lt;ref name=Mc2016/&gt;

==History==
The term glioblastoma multiforme was introduced in 1926 by [[Percival Bailey]] and [[Harvey Cushing]], based on the idea that the tumor originates from primitive precursors of [[glial cell]]s ([[glioblast]]s), and the highly variable appearance due to the presence of necrosis, hemorrhage and cysts (multiform).&lt;ref&gt;Bailey &amp; Cushing: ''Tumors of the Glioma Group''. JB Lippincott, Philadelphia, 1926.{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===MicroRNA===
As of 2012, RNA interference, usually microRNA, was under investigation in tissue culture, pathology specimens and in preclinical animal models of glioblastoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12035-012-8349-7 |title=A Systematic Review of MicroRNA in Glioblastoma Multiforme: Micro-modulators in the Mesenchymal Mode of Migration and Invasion |year=2012 |last1=Møller |first1=Heidi G. |last2=Rasmussen |first2=Andreas P. |last3=Andersen |first3=Hjalte H. |last4=Johnsen |first4=Kasper B. |last5=Henriksen |first5=Michael |last6=Duroux |first6=Meg |journal=Molecular Neurobiology |volume=47 |pages=131–44 |pmid=23054677 |issue=1 |pmc=3538124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gene therapy===

==About==
Help Remedies differ from many other over-the-counter drugs in that each product is made with a single [[active ingredient]], for example, the medicine used to help with a headache only contains [[acetaminophen]]. Help Remedy's products also contain less dyes and coatings than many other drugs. Help Remedies' products are intended to exemplify simplicity. All of their products they offer are named based on the specific symptom which it's intended to treat so that customers know what they are taking.&lt;ref name=Help&gt;{{cite web|title=Help Remedies|url=http://www.helpineedhelp.com/#/thinking|publisher=Help|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2011, the company reached $4 million in sales and plans to expand to [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Portland, Oregon]], [[Austin, Texas]], [[Chicago]], and [[Miami]].&lt;ref name=founders /&gt;

==Remedies==
Help Remedies products treat medical conditions such as [[nausea]], [[headache]] or [[insomnia]].&lt;ref name=founders /&gt;

A '''hospital ship''' is a [[ship]] designated for primary function as a floating [[healthcare|medical treatment]] facility or [[hospital]].  Most are operated by the [[military]] forces (mostly [[navy|navies]]) of various countries, as they are intended to be used in or near war zones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=hospital%20ship Hospital Ship]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (definition via [[WordNet]], [[Princeton University]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Although attacking a hospital ship is a [[war crime]], belligerent navies have the right to board such ships for inspections.

In the nineteenth century redundant warships were used as moored hospitals for seamen.

==History==

===Early examples===
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Part of Tangier from above (State 3).jpg|thumb|Tangier circa 1670. Hospital ships were used during the evacuation of the port in the 1680s.]]
Hospital ships possibly existed in ancient times. The [[Athenian military|Athenian Navy]] had a ship named ''Therapia'', and the [[Roman Navy]] had a ship named ''Aesculapius'', their names indicating that they may have been hospital ships.

The earliest British hospital ship may have been the vessel ''Goodwill'', which accompanied a [[Royal Navy]] squadron in the Mediterranean in 1608 and was used to house the sick sent aboard from other ships.&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sutherland Shaw|first=J.J.|title=The Hospital Ship, 1608{{ndash}}1740|journal=The Mariner's Mirror|volume=22|issue=4|year=1936|doi=10.1080/00253359.1936.10657206|pages=422–426}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this experiment in medical care was short-lived, with ''Goodwill'' assigned to other tasks within a year and her complement of convalescents simply left behind at the nearest port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oppenheim|first=M.|title=A History of the Administration of the Royal Navy and of Merchant Shipping in Relation to the Navy|page=188|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofadminis00oppe#page/188/mode/2up|volume=1|publisher=The Bodley Head|year=1896|oclc=506062953}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the mid-seventeenth century that any Royal Navy vessels were formally designated as hospital ships, and then only two throughout the fleet. These were either hired merchant ship or elderly [[sixth rate]]s, with the internal [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] removed to create more room, and additional ports cut through the deck and hull to increase internal ventilation.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt;

In addition to their sailing crew, these seventeenth century hospital ships were staffed by a surgeon and four surgeon's mates. The standard issue of medical supplies were bandages, soap, needles and [[bedpan]]s. Patients were offered a bed or rug to rest upon, and given a clean pair of sheets. These early hospital  ships were for the care of the sick rather than the wounded, with patients quartered according to their symptoms and infectious cases quarantined from the general population behind a sheet of canvas. The quality of food was very poor. In the 1690s the surgeon aboard ''Siam'' complained that the meat was in an advanced state of [[putrefaction]], the biscuits were weevil-ridden and bitter, and the bread was so hard that it stripped the skin off patient's mouths.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt;

Hospital ships were also used for the treatment of wounded soldiers fighting on land. An early example of this was during an English operation to evacuate [[English Tangier]] in 1683. An account of this evacuation was written by [[Samuel Pepys]], an eyewitness. One of the main concerns was the evacuation of sick soldiers "and the many families and their effects to be brought off". The hospital ships ''Unity'' and ''Welcome'' sailed for England on 18 October 1683 with 114 invalid soldiers and 104 women and children, arriving at [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]] on 14 December 1683.&lt;ref name="McCallum"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5BXB9QtUfFQC|title=Military Medicine: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century|author=Jack Edward McCallum|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of medical personnel aboard Royal Navy hospital ships was slowly increased, with regulations issued in 1703 requiring that each vessel also carry six [[landsman (rank)|landsmen]] to act surgical assistants, and four washerwomen. A 1705 amendment provided for a further five male [[nurse]]s, and requisitions from the era suggest the number of sheets per patient was increased from one to two pairs.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt; On 8 December 1798, unfit for service as a warship, {{HMS|Victory}} was ordered to be converted to a hospital ship to hold wounded French and Spanish prisoners of war. According to [[Edward Hasted]] in 1798, two large hospital ships (also called [[lazaretto]]s), (which were the surviving hulks of forty-four gun ships) were moored in [[Lower Halstow|Halstow]] Creek in [[Kent]]. The creek is an inlet from the [[River Medway]] and the [[River Thames]].  The crew of these vessels watched over ships coming to England, which were forced to stay in the creek under [[quarantine]] to protect the country from infectious diseases including the [[Plague (disease)|plague]].&lt;ref name=hasted&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hasted |first=Edward |year=1799 |title=Parishes |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=62945 |journal=The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |volume=6 |pages=34–40 |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1821 to 1870 the [[Seamen's Hospital Society]] provided [[HMS Grampus (1802)|HMS ''Grampus'']], [[HMS Dreadnought (1801)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] and [[HMS Caledonia (1808)|HMS ''Caledonia'']] (later renamed ''Dreadnought'') as successive hospital ships moored at [[Deptford]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research guide A6: Greenwich and the National Maritime Museum|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/researchers/research-guides/research-guide-a6-greenwich-and-national-maritime-museum|website=Royal Museums Greenwich|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 [[HMS Hamadryad (1823)|HMS ''Hamadryad'']] was moored in [[Cardiff]] as a seamen's hospital, replaced in 1905 by the [[Royal Hamadryad Hospital|Royal Hamadryad Seamen's Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Phil Carradice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6DOIAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Ships of Pembroke Dockyard |publisher=Amberley Publishing |pages=52–53 |year=2013 |format=e-book |ISBN=978-1-4456-1310-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other redundant warships were used as hospitals for convicts and prisoners of war.

===Modern hospital ships===
[[File:HMS Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|300x300px|HMS ''Melbourne'', the first modern hospital ship, served during the [[Second Opium War]]. Excerpt from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' about the ship (click to read).]]
The institutionalization of the use of hospital ships by the [[Royal Navy]] occurred during the first half of  the nineteenth century. By the standard of the medical provision available at the time for convalescent soldiers, hospital ships were generally superior in their standard of service and sanitation. It was during the [[Crimean War]] in the 1850s that the modern hospital ship began to emerge. The only military hospital available to the British forces fighting on the [[Crimean Peninsula]] was at [[Shkodër|Scutari]] near the [[Dardanelles]]. Over the course of the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|Siege of Sevastopol]], almost 15,000 wounded troops were transported there from the port at [[Balaklava]] by a squadron of converted hospital ships.&lt;ref name="McCallum" /&gt;

The first ships to be equipped with genuine medical facilities were the [[steamship]]s HMS ''Melbourne'' and HMS ''Mauritius''. These hospitals were manned by the Medical Staff Corps and provided services to the [[Second Opium War|British expedition to China in 1860]]. The ships provided relatively spacious accommodation for the patients and were equipped with an operating theatre. Another early example of a hospital ship was {{USS|Red Rover|1859|6}} in the 1860s, which aided the wounded soldiers of both sides during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="McCallum" /&gt;

During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]], the [[British Red Cross]] supplied a steel-hulled ship, equipped with modern surgery equipment including [[chloroform]] and other [[anaesthetic]]s and [[carbolic acid]] for [[antisepsis]]. Similar vessels accompanied the [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)|1882 invasion of Egypt]] and aided American personnel during the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name="McCallum" /&gt;

Hospital ships were used by both sides in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–05). It was the sighting by the Japanese of the Russian hospital ship ''Orel'', correctly illuminated in accordance with regulations, that led to the decisive naval [[Battle of Tsushima]].  ''Orel'' was retained as a prize of war by the Japanese after the battle.

===World Wars===
[[Image:HMHS Mauretania.jpg|thumb|right|[[RMS Mauretania (1906)|RMS ''Mauretania'']] as hospital ship HMHS ''Mauretania'' during [[World War I]].]]
[[File:HMHS Aquitania.jpg|thumb|250px|left|HMHS ''Aquitania'' in World War I service as a hospital ship.]]
During World War I and World War II, hospital ships were first used on a massive scale. Many [[ocean liner|passenger liners]] were converted for use as hospital ships. {{RMS|Aquitania}} and {{HMHS|Britannic}} were two famous examples of ships serving in this capacity. By the end of the First World War, The British Royal Navy had 77 such ships in service. During the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], hospital ships were used to evacuate over 100,000 wounded personnel to [[Egypt]].

[[Canada]] operated hospital ships in both world wars. In World War I these included SS ''Letitia'' (I) and {{HMHS|Llandovery Castle}} which was deliberately sunk by a German [[U-boat]] with great loss of life, despite the hospital ship's clearly marked status. In World War II, Canada operated the hospital ship {{RMS|Lady Nelson}} and [[SS Letitia|SS ''Letitia (II)]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas N. W. Smith, "Bringing Home the Wounded", ''Canadian Rail Passenger Yearbook 1996–1997 Edition'', Trackside Canada, Ottawa, p. 49-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMHS Britannic.jpg|thumbnail|right|{{HMHS|Britannic||2}} (youngest sister of {{RMS|Titanic||2}} and {{RMS|Olympic||2}}) after conversion to a hospital ship during World War I.]]
The last British [[royal yacht]], the post World War II {{ship|HMY|Britannia}}, was ostensibly constructed in a way as to be easily convertible to a hospital ship in wartime. After her decommissioning, [[Peter Hennessey]] discovered that this was a cover story: her actual role would have been as [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Operation Candid|refuge from nuclear weapons]], hiding amidst the [[loch]]s ([[fjord]]s) of western Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A development of the [[Lun-class ekranoplan]] was planned for use as a mobile field hospital for rapid deployment to any ocean or coastal location at a speed of 297 knots (550&amp;nbsp;km/h, 341.8 mph). Work was 90% complete on this model, ''Spasatel'', but Soviet military funding ceased and it was never completed.

Some hospital ships, such as {{SS|Hope}} and ''[[Esperanza del Mar]]'', belong to civilian agencies, and as such are not part of any navy. [[Mercy Ships]], an international charity, do not belong to any government.

==International law==
[[File:SLE1102 SHIPARRIVE LC07.jpg|thumb|right|Non-government hospital ship {{MV|Africa Mercy}}]]
Hospital ships were covered under the [[Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Convention X of 1907]].&lt;ref name="hague10"&gt;{{cite web |date= October 18, 1907|url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague10.asp|title = Convention for the adaptation to maritime war of the principles of the Geneva Convention|publisher = [[Yale University]]| accessdate = August 2, 2009 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Article four of the Hague Convention X outlined the restrictions for a hospital ship:
* Ship must be clearly marked and lighted as a hospital ship
* The ship should give medical assistance to wounded personnel of all nationalities
* The ship must not be used for any military purpose
* The ship must not interfere with or hamper enemy combatant vessels
* Belligerents, as designated by the Hague Convention, can search any hospital ship to investigate violations of the above restrictions
* Belligerents will establish the location of a hospital ship

According to the [[San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea]], a hospital ship violating legal restrictions must be duly warned and given a reasonable time limit to comply. If a hospital ship persists in violating restrictions, a belligerent is legally entitled to capture it or take other means to enforce compliance. A non-complying hospital ship may only be fired on under the following conditions:
* Diversion or capture is not feasible
* No other method to exercise control is available
* The violations are grave enough to allow the ship to be classified as a military objective
* The damage and casualties will not be disproportionate to the military advantage.

In all other circumstances, attacking a hospital ship is a [[war crime]].

Modern hospital ships display large [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Cross|Red Crosses]] or [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Crescent|Red Crescents]] to signify their [[Geneva Convention]] protection under the [[laws of war]]. Even so, marked vessels have not been completely free from attack. Notable examples of hospital ships deliberately attacked during wartime are {{HMHS|Llandovery Castle}} in 1915, the {{ship|Soviet hospital ship|Armenia}} in 1941 and {{ship|AHS|Centaur}} in 1943.

It is common for naval ships, especially large ships such as [[aircraft carrier]]s and [[amphibious assault ship]]s to have on-board hospitals. However, they are only one small part of the vessel's overall capability, and are used primarily for the ship's crew and its amphibious forces (and occasionally for relief missions). They do not qualify as "hospital ships", as they are not marked and designated as such, and as armed vessels they are disqualified from protection as a hospital ship under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/hospital-ships.htm|title=World Wide Hospital Ships|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of these ships from various navies include;

;{{flagicon|USA}} [[United States Navy]]
Several classes of US Navy ships are equipped with on-board hospitals;
* {{sclass-|Gerald R. Ford|aircraft carrier|1}} – USS ''Gerald R. Ford'', first in the class, has an on-board hospital that includes a full lab, pharmacy, operating room, 3-bed intensive care unit, 2-bed emergency room, and 41-bed hospital ward, staffed by 11 medical officers and 30 hospital corpsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ussgeraldrford.wordpress.com/2016/08/08/meet-the-gerald-r-ford-senior-medical-officer/|title=Meet ''Gerald R. Ford''{{'}}s Senior Medical Officer|publisher=ussgeraldrford.wordpress.com|date= 8 August 2016|accessdate= 5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|1}} – Each carrier has a 53-bed hospital ward, a three-bed [[Intensive care unit|ICU]], and acts as the hospital ship for the entire [[carrier strike group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/carrier/the_ship.htm|title=CARRIER . The Ship – PBS|work=pbs.org|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one year, the medical department of {{USS|George Washington|CVN-73|6}} handled over 15,000 out-patient visits, drew almost 27,000 labs, filled almost 10,000 prescriptions, took about 2,300 x-rays and performed 65 surgical operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harwood|first=Jared L.|last2=Pothula|first2=Viswanadham|date=April 2011|title=The USS George Washington medical department: Medicine in motion|url=http://www.facs.org/fellows_info/bulletin/2011/harwood0411.pdf|dead-url=|journal=Bulletin of the American College of Surgeons|volume=96|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519103740/http://facs.org/fellows_info/bulletin/2011/harwood0411.pdf|archive-date=19 May 2011|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not much variation among the ships of the class. The first ship, {{USS|Nimitz}} has 53 beds, plus 3 ICU beds, and the last ship, {{USS|George H.W. Bush}} has 51 beds, plus 3 ICU beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/airfor/cvn77/Pages/Departments.aspx|title=Departments|work=navy.mil|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:USS Bataan (LHD-5);10080504.jpg|thumb|150px|USS ''Bataan'', a ''Wasp''-class amphibious assault ship]]
* {{sclass-|Wasp|amphibious assault ship|1}} (LHD) – These ships have 6 operating rooms, 14 ICU beds, 46 hospital beds, 4 battle dressing stations, [[medical imaging]] (i.e.:X-ray), a fully functional laboratory, and a blood bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/surflant/lhd1/Pages/Departments.aspx|title=USS WASP|work=navy.mil|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship can expand its medical complement to 600 beds, making it the second largest hospital at sea, second only to actual hospital ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/lhd-1.htm|title=LHD-1 Wasp class|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{sclass-|America|amphibious assault ship|0}} amphibious assault ship (LHA) – This is the newest and largest class both in the USN and the world. However, the first two ships of the class, {{USS|America|LHA-6|6}} and {{USS|Tripoli|LHA-7|6}}, had the size of their medical facilities reduced, in favour of larger aviation facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2008/pdf/navy/2008lha6.pdf |format=PDF |title=LHA 6 (formerly LHA(R)) : New Amphibious Assault Ship |website=Dote.osd.mil |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The on-board hospitals of these first two vessels will have 2 operating rooms and 24 beds.&lt;ref name="imef.marines.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imef.marines.mil/Portals/68/Docs/IMEF/PAO/ARG-MEU%20Overview%20Pamphlet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Amphibious Ready Group and Marine expeditionary Unit Overview |website=Imef.marines.mil |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown if this design change will affect the expanded capability for additional beds, nor what size the medical facilities of future ships of the class will be.
* {{sclass-|San Antonio|amphibious transport dock}} (LPD) – 24 hospital beds.&lt;ref name="imef.marines.mil"/&gt;
* {{sclass-|Harpers Ferry|dock landing ship}} (LSD) – 11 hospital beds.&lt;ref name="imef.marines.mil"/&gt;
* {{sclass-|Whidbey Island|dock landing ship|2}} (LSD) – 8 hospital beds.&lt;ref name="imef.marines.mil"/&gt;

;{{flagicon|UK}} [[Royal Navy]]
* [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] ship {{ship|RFA|Argus|A135|6}} – This ship would be a hospital ship were it not for its armaments. However, it is instead designated as a 'Primary Casualty Receiving Ship' (PCRS).

;{{flagicon|China}} [[People's Liberation Army Navy]]
* Several armed {{sclass2-|Qiongsha|cargo ship|1}}s are fitted out as "ambulance transports".
* ''[[Type 0891A training ship|Shichang]]'' – a multi-role training ship built in 1997. Deck space can accommodate modular medical units and can be used as a medical treatment facility, but the primary role is aviation training. The layout is very similar to RFA ''Argus'' (see above).

[[File:BPC Dixmude.jpg|thumb|150px|''Dixmude'', a ''Mistral''-class amphibious assault ship]]
;{{flagicon|France}} [[French Navy]]
* {{sclass-|Mistral|amphibious assault ship|2}} – On board [[Mistral-class amphibious assault ship#Hospital|hospital]] is [[NATO]] Echelon level-3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/logi-en/1997/lo-1610.htm|title=NATO Logistics Handbook: Chapter 16: Medical Support|work=nato.int|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 69 hospital beds, 7 ICU beds, and an additional 50 beds if needed. The ship also has [[medical imaging]] capabilities, such as X-ray, CT-scan and ultrasound.

;{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Italian Navy]]
* {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Cavour|550|2}} aircraft carrier – Has an on-board hospital with 2 operating room, 1 intensive care unit, laboratory, pharmacy and a 32-bed hospital ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marina.difesa.it/uominimezzi/navi/Pagine/Cavour.aspx|title=Marina Militare » Uomini e mezzi » Cavour|work=marina.difesa.it|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course can be measured out either in meters or feet (10 m long by 5 m wide or 30&amp;nbsp;ft long by 15&amp;nbsp;ft wide)
The world record for the test was formerly held by Nick Wald (AUS) who completed the course in 10.28 seconds on 9 December 2011, until he was stripped of his title after an investigation conducted by WADA (World Anti Doping Agency) in late 2011 as he was found to have "an above average level of MDMA within his blood stream". WADA's investigation of Nick Wald led to the arrest of Dr. Henry Sestak and Dr. Dominic Mallia, for possessing and administering excessive amounts of MDMA into the bloodstream of numerous athletes.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

The world record is currently held by Miltiadis Papachatzakis (Greece). Miltiadis completed the course in 10.14 seconds on October 14 2016, in Athens, Greece. Miltiadis is believed to currently be on two strikes under the sports illicit drugs policy. Miltiadis was awarded a second strike in early 2016 for testing positive to an illicit substance during his visit to Colombia. 

Former world record holder Dan Kerr has declared that he will return to the sport when his current drug ban expires. WADA handed down Kerr a four-year ban from the sport in 2012, for administering and possessing high levels of diuretic tablets.

An '''impulse''' is a wish or urge, particularly a sudden one. It can be considered as a normal and fundamental part of [[human]] [[thought]] processes, but also one that can become problematic, as in a condition like [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acting on Impulse|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/short-history-mental-health/201210/acting-impulse|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} [[borderline personality disorder]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].

The ability to control impulses, or more specifically control the desire to act on them, is an important factor in [[Personality psychology|personality]] and [[socialization]]. [[Delayed gratification|Deferred gratification]], also known as [[Impulse control disorder|impulse control]] is an example of this, concerning impulses primarily relating to things that a person wants or desires.
{{quote|Many psychological problems are characterized by a loss of control or a lack of control in specific situations. Usually, this lack of control is part of a pattern of behavior that also involves other maladaptive thoughts and actions, such as [[substance abuse]] problems or sexual disorders like the [[paraphilia]]s (e.g. [[pedophilia]] and [[exhibitionism]]). When loss of control is only a component of a disorder, it usually does not have to be a part of the behavior pattern, and other symptoms must also be present for the diagnosis to be made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2519">The '''Jakarta Declaration on Leading Health Promotion into the 21st Century''' is the name of an international agreement that was signed at the [[World Health Organization]]'s 1997 Fourth International Conference on Health Promotion held in [[Jakarta]].&lt;ref name=DeclarationWHO&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthpromotion/conferences/previous/jakarta/declaration/en/index.html Jakarta Declaration on Leading Health Promotion into the 21st Century.] Accessed 2009 Jan 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration reiterated the importance of the agreements made in the [[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]], and added emphasis to certain aspects of [[health promotion]].

==About the Declaration==
The Jakarta Declaration included the following five "priorities for health promotion in the 21st century":&lt;ref name=DeclarationWHO/&gt;
:1. "Promote social responsibility for [[health]]"
:2. "Increase investments for health development"
:3. "Consolidate and expand partnerships for health"
:4. "increase community capacity and empower the individual"
:5. "Secure an infrastructure for health promotion"

The declaration recognizes that":&lt;ref name=DeclarationWHO/&gt; 
* Participation is necessary for change.
* Health literacy is essential for participation - emphasizes the need for access to [[education]] and information and hence, the empowerment of individuals and communities.
* Combinations of five strategies for health promotion -- "build healthy [[public policy]]", "create supportive environments", "strengthen community action", "develop personal skills", and "reorient [[health care|health services]]"—are more effective than "single-track approaches".

==Promotion of the Declaration==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the central message of the Jakarta declaration is similar to the government's current [[health policy]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. That is the emphasis on infrastructure and investment, with the hope of empowering the service user with choice.

'''Jermuk''' ({{lang-hy|Ջերմուկ}}) is a bottled [[mineral water]] originating from the town of [[Jermuk]] in [[Vayots Dzor Province]], [[Armenia]]. The water is being bottled since 1951.

Currently, the brand is bottled and produced by the Jermuk Group CJSC, founded in 1999 in [[Jermuk]], classified into 2 categories: ''Jermuk Classic'' mineral carbonated water, and ''Jermuk Millennium'' mineral mildly carbonated water. In 2015-16 the factory of "Jermuk Mayr Gortsaran" founded in 1951 was acquired by the Jermuk Group. 

==History==
Jermuk mineral water has been used for its medicinal properties since centuries, as is clear from primitive stone basins, one of which has survived as a reminder of the past. Jermuk was first mentioned in writing in 189 AD, when Jermuk fortress was built, with the eponymous town being founded some time later. According to historical records, Jermuk was the summer residence of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] princes of the neighbouring province of [[Syunik (historic province)|Syunik]].

The first surveys of the area around Jermuk (including the composition and properties of its mineral waters) were made in 1830 by the [[Russians|Russian]] geologist and engineer G. Dzoyokoyev-Boykikov; these did not result in the commercial exploitation of "Jermuk" mineral water, however. Only in 1925-1935 did well-known scientists like V. Alexandrov S. Nalbandov, V. Dikin and A. Melik-Aramyan and others subject Jermuk's mineral waters to scientific examination, in the process confirming its unquestionable medicinal properties. In 1945 the Soviet government took the decision to turn Jermuk town into a health resort of nationwide significance, in view of the mineral water's extraordinary healing properties. By the 1970s the visitors to [[Jermuk]]'s sanatoria numbered 25-30,000 people yearly.

==Features==
[[File:Producing Jermuk Mineral Water (Armenia).jpg|thumb|Jermuk Group CJSC]]
[[File:Jermuk mineral water.jpg|thumb|Jermuk mineral water from the Jermuk Group company]]
In its chemical composition, it is similar to the waters of Jeleznovodsk and Karlovy Vary, but in its taste it has no equal.

Production is organized in the town of Jermuk itself, at source nr. 30/62, from where both Jermuk mineral water and natural [[carbon dioxide]] gas enter the factory's production cycle and are bottled and packaged using the latest automated technology. The constantly high quality of Jermuk mineral water is assured by the use of contemporary machinery, through the efforts of capable experts, and thanks to the continuous supervision of the factory's central laboratory. Jermuk mineral water is produced in 0.5 litre standard and company glass bottles, as well as in 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 litre plastic (PET) bottles, all made out of materials suitable for foodstuffs and hermetically sealed. Its expiration date is 12 months from production, provided it is stored in a cool and dark place. Jermuk mineral water has been certified by the state standards' authorities in both the Republic of Armenia and the Russian Federation, according to Armenian standard nr. 191-2000.

On a daily basis, the company's central lab supervises its microbiological purity and its chemical composition's main elements, which have to correspond to the following standard, mentioned on international labels.

Chemical composition:
* Ca=200
* Mg=50-80
* Na+K=900-1100
* HCO3=1800-2150
* SO4=630-780
* Cl=300-360
* Total Mineralization=3900-4800

==Packaging==

==FDA warning==
May 31, 2007: the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is warning consumers in the West Chester, Pennsylvania area not to drink any Jermuk brand mineral water due to the risk of exposure to arsenic, a toxic substance and a know cause of cancer in humans. Jermuk Classic Medicinal Table Natural Sparkling Mineral Water in 0.5 liter green translucent glass bottles under the Jermuk Group brand label was recalled on 5/1/07 by AA Impex Group, Philadelphia, PA. Approximately, 200 bottles of the product were sold at the Great Pumpkin Corporation, 607 East Market Street, West Chester, PA, a retail store. FDA has sampled the product and found that it contains 536-539 micrograms of arsenic per liter of water. FDA's standard of quality for bottled water allows no more than 10 micrograms per liter. Product can be returned to the Great Pumpkin for a refund. There have been no illnesses reported at this time. Consumers who drank this water and have concerns are encouraged to contact their health care provider.

June 12, 2017: the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) sampled products in California and found that Jermuk brand mineral water, along with Arpi Mineral Water, contained levels of arsenic above 450 micrograms. This is a 17% decrease from the amount found 10 years before, but is still 4500% more than the maximum allowable amount (10 micrograms per liter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Import Alert 29-02|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_97.html|website=FDA|publisher=FDA|accessdate=17 October 2017|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hockey and Lacrosse career==
Jim Moss played both ice hockey and lacrosse his entire early life and ultimately earned the opportunity to represent team Canada in three sports - Ice Hockey, Field Lacrosse, and Indoor Lacrosse.

Growing up, he played hockey in Brampton, Ontario, Canada starting at the age of seven, where he is now a member of the [[Brampton Sports Hall of Fame]]. He began playing Junior A tier 2 for the Brampton Capitals at the age of 15 and then went on to become a member of the [[London Knights]] [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]] hockey club for the 96-97 season and the 97-98 season. He was named team captain of the 97-98 squad. Following the Ontario Hockey League, he played for the Western Mustangs University team in the CIAU and represented Team Canada at the FISU World Games in Slovakia, where the team earned a bronze medal. He finished his hockey career off with the Huntington Blizzards of the [[ECHL]] after suffering a number of concussions he was forced to take a season off and decided at that time to return to professional lacrosse in NLL.

Jim's lacrosse career also began in Brampton Ontario, playing in the Ontario Minor Lacrosse Association. He was called up to play Junior for the Brampton Excelsiors in 1992, and then represented Canada with the Jr Men's National Lacrosse team in 1996. Jim served as Team Captain in their silver medal winning effort. Jim was also selected to represent Team Canada in the first ever [[World Indoor Lacrosse Championship]] where he won his first gold medal. Jim also played for the [[Brampton Excelsiors (MSL)|Brampton Excelsiors]] Sr. Lacrosse team where he won his first [[Mann Cup]] in 2005, scoring the series winning goal against the [[Victoria Shamrocks]]. While living and playing lacrosse in San Jose California, Jim coached children at all ages and competitive classes, both men's and women's lacrosse, and including an assistant coaching role with the [[Stanford Cardinal women's lacrosse|Stanford]] NCAA Division 1 Women's lacrosse program.

==Personal life==

Jim has been married to his wife Jennifer Leigh Moss (formerly Jennifer Young) since July 9, 2005. The couple has one son, Wyatt, and two daughters, Olivia and Lyla. Wyatt is a high potential competitive dancer finishing in the top 10 for boys his age in North America.

In September 2009, Jim Moss contracted what was believed to be [[Guillain-Barré syndrome|
Guillane-Barre Syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilindoor.com/2010/11/18/jim-moss-lacrosse-comeback-cut-short-by-additional-health-issues-calgary-goes-xtreme-doyle-back-in-k-w-plus-the-links/ Jim Moss lacrosse comeback cut short by additional health issues, Calgary goes ‘Xtreme’, Doyle back in K-W, plus the links]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then this diagnosis has been rescinded, leaving his diagnosis as an undefined post-viral neuro-muscular disease. The Auto-immune disease ended Jim's professional sports career. After keeping a private gratitude journal in the hospital and while he learned to walk again, he began to share this publicly which garnered much support. By simply writing what made him smile or that he was grateful for on a piece of paper above an image of a smile, his current project, The Smile Epidemic, was born.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.therecord.com/living/healthfitness/article/782452--lacrosse-player-s-illness-leads-to-a-smile-epidemic&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Smile Epidemic==

Experiencing [[Posttraumatic growth|Post Traumatic Growth]] Jim began The Smile Epidemic, an update on the classic concept of a gratitude journal, which capitalizes on the popularity and capacities of Internet sharing and social network technologies. In its simplest format, users interface digitally, capturing and sharing photos of what made them smile throughout their day.

The campaign garnered significant momentum, including a feature on CTV and CBC News.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=790037&amp;playlistId=1.1006480&amp;binId=1.811496&lt;/ref&gt; Jim was also featured on the Oprah Winfrey Network's Life Story Project in February 2013. The Smile Epidemic was selected to present at the SXSW 2013 festival in Austin, Texas in March, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://sxsw.com/interactive/sessions/programming&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smile Epidemic has since blossomed into a B2B Software company, called Plasticity Labs building research-based applications to improve people's health happiness and performance in the workplace. [http://PlasticityLabs.com Plasticity] is a [[Social innovation|Social Innovation]] company where they charge companies and organisations to use their software and give it away for free to individuals and school aged children.

With a deeply held belief that research is the key to understanding human happiness, Plasticity continuously contributes to the academic understanding of human flourishing. [http://www.plasticitylabs.com/hero-generation/ The HERO Generation] is the research and technology solution that focuses on giving school-aged children the character traits they need to thrive at school, and in life.

Moss's personal lifelong mission is to create the world's leading international research facility to understand and improve the happiness of people of all ages, genders, races, and cultures around the world.

The '''Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] which establishes statutory public rights of access to land and makes provisions under which bodies representing rural and [[crofting]] [[community ownership|communities may buy land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 asp 2|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2003/2/pdfs/asp_20030002_en.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==

The 2003 Act includes three main provisions: the creation of a legal framework for [[Freedom to roam|land access]], the community right to buy, and the crofting community right to buy. The first part of the act codifies into [[Scots law]] the right to universal access to land in Scotland.  The act specifically establishes a right to be on land for recreational, educational and certain other purposes and a right to cross land. The rights exist only if they are exercised responsibly, as specified in the [[Scottish Outdoor Access Code]]. Access rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming.

The second part of the act establishes the community right to buy, allowing communities with populations of up to 10,000 to register an interest in land, entitling them to first right of refusal should the owner put the land up for sale or intend to transfer ownership, provided a representative community body can be formed to carry out the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003: Part 2: Community Right to Buy: Guidance|url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/47251/0028902.pdf|publisher=The Scottish Executive|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the third part establish the crofting community right to buy which allows crofting communities to purchase [[Croft (land)|crofts]] and associated land from existing landowners. It differs from the community right to buy in that it can be exercised at any time, regardless of whether the land has been put on the market, allowing crofting communities to purchase land even in the absence of a willing seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crofting Community Right to Buy|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/farmingrural/Rural/rural-land/right-to-buy/crofting|publisher=The Scottish Government|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Morocco received its independence in 1956, the Jewish community held quite a few respectable political positions, including three parliamentarian seats and one cabinet post as mail and telegraph minister.&lt;ref name="JewishWoman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMarcNormStill"&gt;Norman Steilmann, "יהודי מדינות ערב בזמנים המודרניים" (2003), pp. 172–173 {{ISBN|0-8276-0370-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receiving its independence in 1956, the Sultan insisted upon the appointment of Leon Benzaquen, while the Jewish community was unable to reach a consensus on whom to send as a representative to the cabinet. coincident with his appointment Benzaquen expressed his favor opinion on the Jewish right to immigrate, pending it will not include pressure or propaganda. The problem at the time was the objection of various forces in Morocco to a mass Jewish immigration that will play into the hands of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], however the right to immigrate was in fact recognized on an individual basis. He also claimed that Morocco and [[Tunisia]] may play a role in mediating between the Arab states and Israel, and that despite not being able to express their opinion in public, the Moroccan leaders do not sense any sympathy towards [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] or other Arab dictators in the middle east.&lt;ref name="AJC_Interview"/&gt;

The prevailing view is that Benzaquen remained neutral during the Morocco's struggle for independence, due to an internal Jewish struggle among Jewish-Moroccan modernists, graduates of AIU, Zionists, and traditionalists (In 1944, he refused to sign the first Independence Manifesto of the "''Istiqlal''" group, who opposed the occupation but also the kingdom).&lt;ref name="JMarcWeb"/&gt;

Despite this gesture of good will towards the Jewish-Moroccan community, in appointing Leon Benzaquen to a ministerial post, Benzaquen did not survive in occupying the post when there was a government reshuffle for the first time in Morocco since it received its independence, and Jews in Morocco were no longer appointed to the cabinet&lt;ref name="AJC_Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMarcNormStill"/&gt; (until the '80s).&lt;ref name="JewishWoman"/&gt;

'''''Loveline''''' was a [[radio syndication|syndicated radio]] [[Talk show|call-in]] program in North America, offering medical and relationship advice to listeners, often with the assistance of guests, typically actors and musicians. Its host through most of its run was Dr. [[Drew Pinsky]], who would be paired with a radio personality.

''Loveline'' was broadcast live, Sundays through Thursdays at 10pm–midnight [[Pacific Time Zone|PT]] (Mondays through Fridays at 1am–3am [[North American Eastern Time Zone|ET]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://kroq.radio.com/shows/ KROQ-FM—The World Famous KROQ, show listing] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710032531/http://kroq.radio.com/shows/ |date=2012-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Flagship (radio)|flagship station]] was [[KROQ-FM]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Syndication was usually on rock, alternative, and adult talk radio stations. ''Loveline'' could also be heard online anywhere in the world, by streaming through the websites of affiliate stations.

The radio show was discontinued in April 2016. After a hiatus, the show was rebooted as a podcast with [[Amber Rose]] and social worker Chris Donaghue as hosts.  The reboot podcast ran from September 8, 2016 until March 17, 2018.
==History==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2013}}
''Loveline'' began in 1983 as a Sunday night dating and relationships segment on [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] radio station [[KROQ-FM]], hosted by [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Jim Trenton|Jim "Poorman" Trenton]], DJ Swedish Egil (Egil Aalvik), and [[Scott Mason (KROQ)|Scott Mason]]. After a traumatic break up, Mason announced that he would no longer be hosting the show.

In 1984, Trenton added a segment called "Ask a Surgeon," hosted by his friend [[Drew Pinsky]], who at the time, was a fourth-year medical student at the [[University of Southern California]]. The medical segment was pre-dated by an occasional legal segment in which a lawyer, known as "Lawyer Lee" would be present to answer legal questions. As ''Loveline'' developed and increased its audience, Pinsky became a public figure in his own right, and the show began referring to him informally as "Dr. Drew". He eventually came to co-host the show with Trenton. In February 1992, the show expanded from Sunday nights to five nights a week, Sunday through Thursday. In August 1993 Trenton was replaced by former [[MTV]] [[Video jockey|VJ]] [[Riki Rachtman]].

Pinsky and Rachtman were joined by [[Adam Carolla]] in October 1995, as the show was first being syndicated nationally. The trio hosted together for several months, but Carolla and Rachtman often competed for airtime, leading Rachtman to resign in January 1996.&lt;ref name="UMNDaily"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mndaily.com/sites/default/files/paper-pdfs/1996/08/09/1996-08-09.pdf |title=Laying it on the Loveline |last=Cowan |first=Michael |date=August 9, 1996 |accessdate=October 3, 2010 |publisher=[[Minnesota Daily]] |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/668iyAWfi?url=http://www.dolland.net/loveline/cache/laying/index.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolla and Pinsky would go on to host the show together until Carolla's departure in November 2005.

The popularity and reach of ''Loveline'' increased dramatically in the ten years during which it was hosted by Pinsky and Carolla. The two had a natural chemistry, in which Carolla's jocular tone emphasized Pinsky's reasoned expertise. Together, they refined the format of the show, and capitalized on their growing popularity with speaking tours, a television show on [[MTV]] (also titled ''Loveline''), a book, and cameo appearances on television series and movies. In November 2005, Carolla left ''Loveline'' to prepare for a new morning radio show, ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (radio)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'', which began airing in January 2006.

After Carolla's departure, he was substituted on a temporary basis by numerous celebrity guests, some of whom announced their desire to take the job permanently. During his first appearance on [[The Adam Carolla Show (radio)|Carolla's new morning show]], Pinsky revealed that the shortlist of candidates included [[Carson Daly]], [[Joel McHale]], [[Danny Bonaduce]], [[Steve-O]] and [[Daniel Tosh]].&lt;ref name="Blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/04/27/adam-and-anastasia-ashley-deborah-norville-dr-drew-william-shatner-kid-rock-peter-guber-and-the-gibson-contest/#comments|title=ADAM AND ANASTASIA ASHLEY, DEBORAH NORVILLE, DR. DREW, WILLIAM SHATNER, KID ROCK, PETER GUBER, AND THE GIBSON CONTEST|accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, 2006, KROQ-FM disc jockey [[Stryker (disc jockey)|Stryker]] was hired as Pinsky's co-host.

On April 22, 2009, Stryker announced that due to financial cutbacks at Westwood One, he would be leaving the show and it would be his last appearance that night. After Stryker's departure, a number of celebrities guest co-hosted opposite Drew. On March 11, 2010, it was announced that [[Michael Catherwood|Mike "Psycho Mike" Catherwood]] from ''[[Kevin and Bean|The Kevin and Bean Show]]'' would co-host ''Loveline'' with Dr. Drew.

After a long stint as a guest host, Simone Bienne was formally brought on as a co-host in December 2011. This followed Westwood One's merger with Dial Global. She was introduced to the show by Dr. Drew through ''Lifechangers'', and is the first female co-host of the radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/radio-330619-eye-red.html|title=‘Loveline' adds sex and relationship therapist as new co-host  - The Orange County Register|work=The Orange County Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2012 she is no longer a host.

On December 7, 2012, Adam Carolla rejoined Dr. Drew for a Loveline-style "Reunion Tour" of the US to promote their new podcast, The Adam &amp; Dr. Drew Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munoz|first=Matt|title=Carolla, Pinsky still feeling the love|url=http://www.bakersfield.com/news/carolla-pinsky-still-feeling-the-love/article_78f7b665-7b3c-5720-8195-6e27ddb268a5.html|publisher=Bakersfield.com|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 2015, Catherwood and Pinsky launched a new program, "Dr. Drew Midday Live with Mike Catherwood" on [[KABC (AM)|KABC]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabc.com/common/page.php?pt=Dr.+Drew+Midday+Live+with+Mike+Catherwood&amp;amp;id=36221&amp;amp;is_corp=0 KABC website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219215034/http://www.kabc.com/common/page.php?pt=Dr.+Drew+Midday+Live+with+Mike+Catherwood&amp;id=36221&amp;is_corp=0 |date=2014-12-19 }}; accessed December 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 2016, Catherwood announced that he would be leaving the show to focus more on raising his daughter. His final episode was March 31, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://www.podcastone.com/pg/jsp/program/episode.jsp?programID=519&amp;pid=1640871|title=Loveline|website=podcastone.com |publisher=Podcast One|host="Psycho Mike" Catherwood, Dr. Drew Pinsky|date=30 March 2016|time= |access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2016, Dr. Drew announced Loveline would wrap up on April 28, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kroq.cbslocal.com/2016/04/21/dr-drew-resigns-from-loveline-after-hosting-for-30-years/|title=Dr. Drew Resigns from Loveline, Ends Show|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Carolla re-joined him as co-host for the final show.

On September 8, 2016, the show was rebooted as a weekly podcast, with [[Amber Rose]] and Dr. Chris Donaghue serving as hosts.

==Format==
''Loveline'' follows the call-in question-and-answer model with the primary goal of helping youth and young adults with [[interpersonal relationship|relationship]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[drug addiction]] problems through the expertise of Pinsky, an [[internal medicine|internist]] and [[addiction medicine]] specialist, and the humorous context and insight provided by a comedic host. Adam Carolla explained his role as a "sheep in wolf's clothing".&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Carolla]] and [[Drew Pinsky]]. ''The Dr. Drew and Adam Book: A Survival Guide To Life and Love'' Dell Books, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the comedy is often necessary to keep spirits high, as the show frequently handles callers who are dealing with serious issues such as [[drug addiction]], [[sexual abuse]], and [[domestic violence]].

The show will occasionally answer calls of a general medical nature, especially on slow nights or if they seem peculiar. Also, listeners are encouraged to participate in Loveline's many games.

==Media tie-ins and cultural influence==
A [[television|TV]] version of ''Loveline'' ran on MTV from 1996–2000; which was produced by Stone Stanley Entertainment. It followed the same general format as the radio program but featured a live audience and a female co-host. The female co-host role was filled over the course of the series by MTV VJ [[Idalis DeLeón|Idalis]], actresses [[Kris McGaha]], [[Catherine McCord]], [[Diane Farr]] and comedian [[Laura Kightlinger]]. ''Loveline TV'' was filmed at [[Hollywood Center Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'', April 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Dr. Drew and Adam Book: A Survival Guide to Life and Love'', an advice book written in a tone similar to the radio show, was released in 1998.

The series has also spawned a number of [[List of Loveline games|''Loveline''-inspired games]] that have been mentioned on the show.&lt;ref&gt;''Loveline'' September 11, 2001—First Caller&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Loveline'' October 19, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Loveline'' October 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Loveline'' February 23, 2003—Third Caller&lt;/ref&gt;

A thinly-veiled reference to ''Loveline'' can be seen in the 1989 film [[Heathers]] in a scene featuring a radio call-in advice program called ''Hot Probs'' hosted by none other than [[Jim Trenton]], a former host of ''Loveline''.&lt;ref name="thew_Girl"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Girls on Film: Why no teen film compares to Heathers | author =  | work = theweek.com | date =March 28, 2014  | accessdate = 2016-06-23 | url = http://theweek.com/articles/448688/girls-film-why-no-teen-film-compares-heathers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female co-hosts on MTV's ''Loveline''===
* [[Kris McGaha]] (1996–1997)
* [[Laura Kightlinger]] (1997)
* Lou Thornton (1997)
* [[Carmen Electra]] (1997)
* [[Idalis DeLeon]] (1997)

The '''MAGIC foundation''' for children's growth is an American non-profit organization which helps families of children diagnosed with a wide variety of different growth impacting medical conditions through education, networking, physician referrals and numerous other services. It was founded in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |coauthors= |title=NORD Guide |year=1997 |publisher=[[National Organization for Rare Disorders]] |page= |quote= Established in 1989, the MAGIC Foundation for Children's Growth assists families of affected children through local support groups, public education and awareness, newsletters, specialty divisions, and programs for children, ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VftpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22MAGIC+foundation%22&amp;dq=%22MAGIC+foundation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X22NTeXGGeSQ0QG1mYGqCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=11&amp;ved=0CHAQ6AEwCg |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adelson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Betty M.

MAGIC is short for ''Major Aspects of Growth In Children''.&lt;ref name=magic/&gt;

The foundation has a membership network in excess of 25,000 families. The disorders MAGIC families have are grouped into primary categories. They include: [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], [[precocious puberty]], [[growth hormone deficiency]] (both adults and children), [[panhypopituitarism]], [[McCune-Albright syndrome]], [[Turner syndrome]], [[Russell-Silver syndrome]], thyroid disorders (both [[congenital hypothyroidism|congenital]] and acquired), [[optic nerve hypoplasia]], and other rare disorders.&lt;ref name=magic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magicfoundation.org/www |title=MAGIC Foundation |accessdate=2011-03-25 |quote= |publisher=MAGIC Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321101529/http://www.magicfoundation.org/www |archivedate=21 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational programs ==
MAGIC offers a national educational program every year for the families of affected children and another for affected adults. Physicians specialising in these disorders, from all over the world, volunteer to speak to and assist the children and affected adults. They also offer a weekly email with links to recently published medical information to parents of children impacted by Small for Gestational Age babies, Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, McCune-Albright Syndrome, Russell-Silver Syndrome (also known as Silver-Russell Syndrome), Optic Nerve Hypoplasia, Septo Optic Dysplasia, Hypophosphatasia, and others.

== Controversy ==
The MAGIC Foundation received significant funding from [[Genentech]] and [[Eli Lilly]]. It was thought that the money was to undertake [[case finding]] of children with [[short stature]] who might benefit from their [[human growth hormone]] treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Melody Petersen |coauthors= |title=Our Daily Meds: How the Pharmaceutical Companies Transformed Themselves Into Slick Marketing Machines and Hooked the Nation on Prescription Drugs |year=2009 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |page= |quote=In a campaign in the early 1990s the Magic Foundation, as well as another group, the [[Human Growth Foundation]], had measured the height of children in ...

None of the monies donated to either the Human Growth Foundation nor The Magic foundation were donated with any stipulations as to how the money was to be utilized. The donations were  support funds for the patients affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the 1930s echinacea became popular in both Europe and America as an herbal medicine. According to Wallace Sampson, MD, its modern-day use as a treatment for the common cold began when a Swiss herbal supplement maker was "erroneously told" that echinacea was used for cold prevention by Native American tribes who lived in the area of South Dakota.&lt;ref name="WebMD"&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20070626/study-echinacea-cuts-colds-by-half Study: Echinacea Cuts Colds by Half] WebMD Health News, June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Although Native American tribes didn't use echinacea to prevent the common cold, some Plains tribes did use echinacea to treat some of the symptoms that could be caused by the common cold: The [[Kiowa]] used it for coughs and sore throats, the [[Cheyenne]] for sore throats, the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] for headaches, and many tribes including the [[Lakota people|Lakotah]] used it as an analgesic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moerman|first=Daniel E.|title=Native American Ethnobotany|publisher=Timber Press|year=1998|page=205|isbn=978-0-88192-453-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXaQat5icHUC&amp;pg=PA205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans learned of ''[[Echinacea angustifolia|E. angustifolia]]'' by observing [[elk]] seeking out the plants and consuming them when sick or wounded, and identified those plants as elk root.&lt;ref name="Tilford"/&gt; The following table examines why various tribes use echinacea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christopherhobbs.com/library/articles-on-herbs-and-health/echinacea-from-native-american-pancea-to-modern-phytopharmaceutical/|title=Echinacea: From Native American Pancea to Modern Phytopharmaceutical – Dr. Christopher Hobbs|website=www.christopherhobbs.com|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Pinus quadrifolia]]'', used medicinally by the [[Cahuilla]] by taking the [[resin]] and making a face cream usually used by girls to prevent [[sunburn]]. The resin was also used as a glue for fixing pottery and reattaching arrowheads to the arrow shafts. The nuts were given to babies as an alternative for breast milk; were grounded then mixed with water as a drink; were roasted; were ground into mush; and were an important trade item. The pine needles and roots were materials for basketry and the bark was used as roofing material of houses. The wood was burnt as firewood because of high [[combustibility]] and incense for the pleasant smell it emitted when burnt.

*[[Salvia officinalis|Sage]] is a small evergreen shrub used to treat inflammation, bacterial or viral infection and chronic illness. Commonly treated conditions include abdominal cramping/pain, bloating, bleeding, bruising, skin disease, cough, excessive sweating, menstrual cramps and flu as well as depression, obesity heart disease and cancer. Sage can be administered in tea, food, as a poultice or in smoke. Sage contains multiple essential oils as well as tannins and flavonoids, which have "carminative, antispasmodic, antiseptic, and astringent properties".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition to being used in modern food preparation, sage is still utilized for herbal and pharmaceutical medicines with strong evidence supporting its impacts.

*''[[Senegalia greggii]]'', the fresh pods were eaten unripe by the [[Chemehuevi]], [[Pima people|Pima]], and the [[Cahuilla]]. The Cahuilla dried the pods then ground it for mush and cakes, the [[Havasupai]] ground it to make bread flour, and the [[Seri people|Seri]] ground it to meal to mix with water and sea lion oil for [[porridge]]. The [[Diegueno]] used it as food for domesticated animals. The Cahuilla and Pima used it for construction material and firewood. The Havasupai split the twigs to make as basket material and used bundles as a broom for dusting off [[metate]]s. The [[Tohono O'odham|Papago]] broke the twigs in half to make baskets, and were curved to make difficult weaves in the baskets. The Pima piled dried bushes for a brush fence, and used the branches for cradle frames too. The Papago deer hunters wore the branches as a disguise as a deer, and the buds and blossoms were dried for perfume pouches. The branches were used to dislodge [[saguaro]] fruits from the body, and the rods were used to remove flesh from animal skins. The Pima used the wood for bows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herb Search |url=http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl|website=herb.umd.umich.edu|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason for the vast differences in the use of the willow is that there are many ways to prepare it and these different preparations allow for it to be utilized in different ways. For example, the Thompson people would make a concoction of wood, willow, soapberry branches and "anything weeds" to treat broken bones. If they wanted to treat a cold, however, the Thompson people would make a decoction of red willow branches and wild rose roots.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6834">The '''Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON-2006''' is a [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] tool used for diagnosing personality dysfunctions  that contribute to the development of [[neurotic disorders]]. The use of the questionnaire may facilitate the diagnosis of neurotic disorder, as well as make it easier to differentiate between neurotic and [[pseudoneurotic]] syndroms, e.g. reaction to stress. Moreover, the questionnaire enables evaluation of changes occurring in the course of treatment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Aleksandrowicz JW, Klasa K, Sobański JA. Stolarska D.

The questionnaire has been created by Jerzy W. Aleksandrowicz, Katarzyna Klasa, Jerzy A. Sobański and Dorota Stolarska in the Department of Psychotherapy of the [[Jagiellonian University]] [[Jagiellonian University Medical College|Medical College]] in Kraków, Poland.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

== The content of the questionnaire ==
The questionnaire consists of 243 items that require positive or negative answer. They determine the values of 24 scales that describe areas related to the development of neurotic disorders, as well as the value of X-KON index that describes the global intensity of neurotic personality. Currently, only the Polish and Ukrainian versions of KON-2006 are available, however a number of studies based on the tool has been published in English.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Орлов|first=О|last2=Лобанов|first2=І|date=2016|title=Психологічна діагностика невротизації особистості (український переклад та апробація опитувальника невротичних особистісних рис KON-2006)|url=http://www.pj.kherson.ua/file/2016/psychology_02/ukr/part_1/20.pdf|journal=Вісник ХДУ Серія Психологічні науки|volume=1|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scales ==
The following working (approximate) names were given to KON-2006 scales:&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; 
# Feeling of being dependent on the environment 
# [[Asthenia]] 
# Negative self-esteem
# [[Impulsiveness]]
# Difficulties with decision making
# Sense of alienation
# [[Demobilization]]
# Tendency to take risks
# Difficulties in emotional relations
# Lack of vitality
# Conviction of own resourcelessness in life
# Sense of lack of control
# Deficit in internal locus of control
# Imagination. indulging in fiction
# Sense of guilt
# Difficulties in interpersonal relations
# Envy
# [[Narcissism|Narcissistic]] attitude
# Sense of being in danger
# Exaltation
# [[Irrationality]]
# Meticulousness
# Ponderings
# Sense of being overloaded

== Methodology of the questionnaire creation ==
Search for and selection of items that were used for the creation of the KON-2006 questionnaire were based on empirical methods. Analysis of usefulness of 779 items was conducted (including items drawn from scales belonging to various personality and temperament inventories e.g. [[16PF Questionnaire|16PF]], [[Mmpi-2|MMPI]], PTS, TTS, IPIP, TCI). Clarity, explicitness and comprehensiveness of each item was evaluated and appropriate improvements were implemented. Next, a comparison of answers was made between healthy individuals and the patients that were beginning treatment due to neurotic disorders. This allowed to select 243 items most useful in differentiation of the patients with neurotic disorders from the healthy individuals. These items were used for the creation of Neurotic Personality Questionnaire. The construction of 24 scales was based on cluster analysis conducted on the population of patients at the beginning of treatment and control groups.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

==Importance of obesity in causing cancer==

[[File:Preventable Causes of Cancer in US.png|thumb|300px|The approximate relative levels of the preventable causes of cancer in the United States, taken from the article [[Cancer prevention]].]]

About 75-80% of all cancers in the United States are preventable, if risk factors are avoided&lt;ref name=Doll&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doll R, Peto R |title=The causes of cancer: quantitative estimates of avoidable risks of cancer in the United States today |journal=J.

Obesity appears to be the third most important risk factor for cancer in the United States, just behind tobacco and diet (see Figure).  Obesity is the source of about 15% of all preventable cancers.&lt;ref name="pmid27458311"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Song M, Giovannucci E |title=Estimating the Influence of Obesity on Cancer Risk: Stratification by Smoking Is Critical |journal=J.

In 2018, Chinese researchers performed a systematic review and comprehensive quantitative meta‐analysis of cohort studies reporting [[body mass index]] (BMI) and the risk of 23 cancer types, providing epidemiological evidence supporting the association between BMI and cancer risk. The strongest positive association between BMI and cancer risk was found among patients in North America.&lt;ref name="WebMD China Obesity Cancer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancer risk linked to obesity by Chinese researchers|url=http://webmd.cn/en/obesity-cancer-risk/|publisher=WebMD China|date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
The mechanisms by which obesity may increase the risk of cancer are not well understood,&lt;ref name=annals/&gt; but it is believed that the combined effects of the adipose tissue environment and the endocrine alterations that accompany it among obese people both interact to promote tumor initiation and progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=J|last2=Morley|first2=TS|last3=Kim|first3=M|last4=Clegg|first4=DJ|last5=Scherer|first5=PE|title=Obesity and cancer--mechanisms underlying tumour progression and recurrence.|journal=Nature Reviews Endocrinology|date=August 2014|volume=10|issue=8|pages=455–65|doi=10.1038/nrendo.2014.94|pmid=24935119|pmc=4374431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adipose tissue also creates an inflammatory environment that enhances the ability of tumor cells to metastatize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Candace A.|last2=Slingerland|first2=Joyce M.|title=Cytokines, Obesity, and Cancer: New Insights on Mechanisms Linking Obesity to Cancer Risk and Progression|journal=Annual Review of Medicine|date=14 January 2013|volume=64|issue=1|pages=45–57|doi=10.1146/annurev-med-121211-091527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S National Cancer Institute indicates that one of the main ways in which obesity can cause cancer is by promoting chronic low-level inflammation, which can, over time, cause DNA damage that leads to cancer.&lt;ref name=NCI&gt;https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/obesity-fact-sheet&lt;/ref&gt;  Articles supporting this view were reviewed by Cerda et al.&lt;ref name="pmid25038989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cerdá C, Sánchez C, Climent B, Vázquez A, Iradi A, El Amrani F, Bediaga A, Sáez GT |title=Oxidative stress and DNA damage in obesity-related tumorigenesis |journal=Adv. Exp. Med.

Funct. |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=533–545 |year=2016 |pmid=27859423 |doi=10.1002/cbf.3229 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA damage appears to be the primary cause of cancer&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein C, Prasad AR, Nfonsam V, Bernstein H.  (2013). DNA Damage, DNA Repair and Cancer, New Research Directions in DNA Repair, Prof. Clark Chen (Ed.), {{ISBN|978-953-51-1114-6}}, InTech, http://www.intechopen.com/books/new-research-directions-in-dna-repair/dna-damage-dna-repair-and-cancer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18403632"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kastan MB | title = DNA damage responses: mechanisms and roles in human disease: 2007 G.H.A. Clowes Memorial Award Lecture | journal = Molecular Cancer Research | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 517–24 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18403632 | doi = 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Carcinogenesis#DNA damage|Carcinogenesis]]).  It is not clear which factor(s) altered by obesity are major source(s) of the DNA damages causing increased cancer risk in obese individuals.  However, both reduced DNA repair and increased DNA damage are observed in obese individuals.

===Reduced DNA repair===
As  first noted in 2005,&lt;ref name="pmid15657333"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berwick M, Vineis P |title=Measuring DNA repair capacity: small steps |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=84–5 |year=2005 |pmid=15657333 |doi=10.1093/jnci/dji038 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is evidence that overweight/obesity is associated with reduced DNA repair capacity.  This was shown, in particular, in women with breast cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid15657342"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kennedy DO, Agrawal M, Shen J, Terry MB, Zhang FF, Senie RT, Motykiewicz G, Santella RM |title=DNA repair capacity of lymphoblastoid cell lines from sisters discordant for breast cancer |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=127–32 |year=2005 |pmid=15657342 |doi=10.1093/jnci/dji013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lymphocytes from postmenopausal obese women also have reduced DNA repair capacity compared to non-obese postmenopausal women.&lt;ref name=Tafurt-Cardona&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tafurt-Cardona Y, Jaramillo-Ruiz LD, Muñoz-Ordóñez W, Muñoz-Benítez SL, Sierra-Torres CH |title=[High frequency of chromosome aberrations observed in lymphocytes in postmenopausal obese women] |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Biomedica |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=344–54 |year=2012 |pmid=23715183 |doi= 10.7705/biomedica.v32i3.412|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If DNA repair is reduced by obesity, this would allow DNA damages to accumulate.  Excess DNA damages, when present in replicating cells, can cause an increase in oncogenic mutations through error-prone [[DNA repair#Translesion synthesis|translesion synthesis]] during replication.

===Increased DNA damage===

An 8-fold and 5.6-fold increase in nuclear damage was observed in [[lymphocyte]]s of obese and overweight children respectively, compared to children of normal weight, evaluated by the gamma-H2AX focus assay.&lt;ref name=Scarpato&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scarpato R, Verola C, Fabiani B, Bianchi V, Saggese G, Federico G |title=Nuclear damage in peripheral lymphocytes of obese and overweight Italian children as evaluated by the gamma-H2AX focus assay and micronucleus test |journal=FASEB J. |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=685–93 |year=2011 |pmid=21068397 |doi=10.1096/fj.10-168427 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gamma-H2AX assay generally reflects the presence of double-strand breaks in DNA, though the assay may indicate other DNA damages as well.&lt;ref name="pmid25773265"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothkamm K, Barnard S, Moquet J, Ellender M, Rana Z, Burdak-Rothkamm S |title=DNA damage foci: Meaning and significance |journal=Environ. Mol. Mutagen. |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=491–504 |year=2015 |pmid=25773265 |doi=10.1002/em.21944 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there was a 2.7-fold and 2.5-fold increase in micronuclei in lymphocytes of obese and overweight children respectively, compared to children of normal weight.&lt;ref name=Scarpato /&gt;  Micronuclei are usually a sign of genotoxic events and chromosomal instability (see [[Micronucleus]]).

[[8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine|8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine]] (8-oxodG) concentration in peripheral blood lymphocytes is an index of nuclear DNA damage.  8-oxodG damages are mutagenic. The level of 8-oxodG was measured in 58 overweight and obese adult patients as well as in 20 normal weight individuals.   The level of 8-oxodG correlated positively with body mass, BMI, hip circumference and triglyceride concentration.&lt;ref name="pmid22936256"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karbownik-Lewinska M, Szosland J, Kokoszko-Bilska A, Stępniak J, Zasada K, Gesing A, Lewinski A |title=Direct contribution of obesity to oxidative damage to macromolecules |journal=Neuro Endocrinol. Lett. |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=453–61 |year=2012 |pmid=22936256 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study by Donmez-Altuntas et al.,&lt;ref name="pmid25308439"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Donmez-Altuntas H, Sahin F, Bayram F, Bitgen N, Mert M, Guclu K, Hamurcu Z, Arıbas S, Gundogan K, Diri H |title=Evaluation of chromosomal damage, cytostasis, cytotoxicity, oxidative DNA damage and their association with body-mass index in obese subjects |journal=Mutat. Res. Genet. Toxicol. Environ. Mutagenesis  |volume=771 |issue= |pages=30–6 |year=2014 |pmid=25308439 |doi=10.1016/j.mrgentox.2014.06.006 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 83 obese, 21 over-weight and 21 normal-weight subjects were tested. Frequencies of DNA damages as measured by frequencies of micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds were found to be significantly higher in lymphocytes of obese subjects than in normal-weight and over-weight subjects (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05) respectively.

Hofer et al.,&lt;ref name="pmid16983997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hofer T, Karlsson HL, Möller L |title=DNA oxidative damage and strand breaks in young healthy individuals: a gender difference and the role of life style factors |journal=Free Radic. Res. |volume=40 |issue=7 |pages=707–14 |year=2006 |pmid=16983997 |doi= 10.1080/10715760500525807|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the enzyme [[formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase]] (FPG) and gel electrophoresis  to measure levels of DNA damage (oxidized purines).  They found two factors that can affect DNA damage in a young healthy population.  These were fruit intake (high intake; lower DNA damage) and BMI (high BMI; higher DNA damage).

In the study by Tafurt-Cardona et al., described above, where they found reduced DNA repair in obese postmenopausal women, they also found increased DNA damages, as measured by frequencies of chromosome aberrations, in the obese  postmenopausal women.&lt;ref name=Tafurt-Cardona /&gt;

==Association by cancer site==

===Bladder cancer===
Obesity is associated with an increased risk of [[bladder cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sun|first1=JW|last2=Zhao|first2=LG|last3=Yang|first3=Y|last4=Ma|first4=X|last5=Wang|first5=YY|last6=Xiang|first6=YB|title=Obesity and risk of bladder cancer: a dose-response meta-analysis of 15 cohort studies.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0119313|pmid=25803438|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0119313|pmc=4372289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breast cancer===
Obesity has been found to decrease the risk of breast cancer among African and Caucasian women, but increase it among Asian women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amadou|first1=A|last2=Ferrari|first2=P|last3=Muwonge|first3=R|last4=Moskal|first4=A|last5=Biessy|first5=C|last6=Romieu|first6=I|last7=Hainaut|first7=P|title=Overweight, obesity and risk of premenopausal breast cancer according to ethnicity: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.|journal=Obesity Reviews|date=August 2013|volume=14|issue=8|pages=665–78|pmid=23615120|doi=10.1111/obr.12028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obesity is also associated with decreased survival among women with breast cancer, regardless of whether the cancer is pre- or post-menopausal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=DS|last2=Vieira|first2=AR|last3=Aune|first3=D|last4=Bandera|first4=EV|last5=Greenwood|first5=DC|last6=McTiernan|first6=A|last7=Navarro Rosenblatt|first7=D|last8=Thune|first8=I|last9=Vieira|first9=R|last10=Norat|first10=T|title=Body mass index and survival in women with breast cancer-systematic literature review and meta-analysis of 82 follow-up studies.|journal=Annals of Oncology|date=October 2014|volume=25|issue=10|pages=1901–14|pmid=24769692|doi=10.1093/annonc/mdu042|pmc=4176449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorectal cancer===
Both general and central obesity are associated with an increased risk of [[colorectal cancer]] (CRC). The [[relative risk]] among obese people relative to those of normal weight has been reported to be 1.334.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=Y|last2=Yang|first2=Y|last3=Wang|first3=F|last4=Zhang|first4=P|last5=Shi|first5=C|last6=Zou|first6=Y|last7=Qin|first7=H|title=Obesity and risk of colorectal cancer: a systematic review of prospective studies.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e53916|pmid=23349764|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053916|pmc=3547959}}&lt;/ref&gt; An association between increased BMI and risk of [[colorectal adenoma]] has been reported, as has a dose-response relationship between BMI and colorectal adenoma risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Okabayashi|first1=K|last2=Ashrafian|first2=H|last3=Hasegawa|first3=H|last4=Yoo|first4=JH|last5=Patel|first5=VM|last6=Harling|first6=L|last7=Rowland|first7=SP|last8=Ali|first8=M|last9=Kitagawa|first9=Y|last10=Darzi|first10=A|last11=Athanasiou|first11=T|title=Body mass index category as a risk factor for colorectal adenomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology|date=August 2012|volume=107|issue=8|pages=1175–85; quiz 1186|doi=10.1038/ajg.2012.180|pmid=22733302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hong|first1=S|last2=Cai|first2=Q|last3=Chen|first3=D|last4=Zhu|first4=W|last5=Huang|first5=W|last6=Li|first6=Z|title=Abdominal obesity and the risk of colorectal adenoma: a meta-analysis of observational studies.|journal=European Journal of Cancer Prevention|date=November 2012|volume=21|issue=6|pages=523–31|pmid=22343656|doi=10.1097/CEJ.0b013e328351c775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased BMI also increases all-cause mortality and mortality from CRC specifically among people diagnosed with CRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=J|last2=Meyerhardt|first2=JA|last3=Giovannucci|first3=E|last4=Jeon|first4=JY|title=Association between body mass index and prognosis of colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0120706|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0120706|pmid=25811460|pmc=4374868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding document is reproduced on Plates IIa, IIb and IIc.&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is to support advanced research and to provide innovative programs in basic and applied medical sciences, and production of biopharmaceuticals and diagnostic kits with special emphasis on infectious diseases. It meets the specialized and scientific health demands of the local community and tries to establish a link between applied research and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.pasteur.ac.ir/ |title=Pasteur Institute of Iran |publisher=En.pasteur.ac.ir |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur Institute is a leading regional facility in the development and manufacture of [[vaccine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nti.org/country-profiles/iran/biological/&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute has a total staff of 1300 in its 28 departments and 5 branches in different cities of Iran, which are active in different areas of medical and pharmaceutical [[biotechnology]]. There are about 50 PhDs and 200 M.Sc graduates. It produces 3.5 billion doses of different vaccines.&lt;ref name=UNCTAD&gt;{{Cite journal

In 1952 during a plague epidemic in western area of Iran, Pasteur Institute of Iran founded a health research center in [[Akanlu]], a village located between Zanjan, Kurdistan and Hamadan. As  a result of the foundation of this center, the various teams of Pasteur Institute of Iran were able to deal with the control of the [[plague (disease)|plague]] endemic in there via taken effective strategies. This research center is now called the [[Research Center for Emerging and Re emerging Infection Diseases]]. In it, Dr. [[Marcel Baltazard]] et al. conducted extensive research on plague and the Akanlu research center established itself as an international reference institution for plague. Since 2013 and in the period of renovation of this the center, the old buildings were renovated and laboratories and new buildings were completed. As of 2015, this center is the national reference center for plague, tularemia and Q fever and has conducted several studies on emerging and reemerging diseases.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Quebec cider''' is crafted in the apple-producing regions of [[Montérégie]], [[Eastern Townships]], [[Chaudière-Appalaches]], the [[Laurentides]], [[Charlevoix]] and [[Capitale-Nationale]], in Canada. The revival of cider is a relatively new phenomenon, since [[Quebec]]'s alcohol regulating body, the ''[[Régie des alcools, des courses et des jeux]]'' began issuing permits to produce craft cider only in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;ACAQ. "[http://www.cidreduquebec.com/Historique.htm Historique] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323183213/http://www.cidreduquebec.com/Historique.htm |date=March 23, 2008 }}", in the site of the ''Association des cidriculteurs artisans du Québec'', retrieved November 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, some 40 [[cider maker]]s were producing more than 100 apple-based alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;ACAQ. "[http://www.cidreduquebec.com/Route.htm La Route des cidres…suivez le guide!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819203702/http://www.cidreduquebec.com/Route.htm |date=August 19, 2008 }}", in the site of the ''Association des cidriculteurs artisans du Québec'', accessed November 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The honour of planting the first apple tree in the [[history of Quebec]] goes to [[Louis Hébert]], [[apothecary]] from [[Paris]] and New France's first settler. He did so around 1617 on the site where [[Quebec City]] was founded in 1608.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Paul-Louis, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GaOfezs1fxcC Les fruits du Québec. Histoire et traditions des douceurs de la table]'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; A good number of the first French settlers to the colony were [[Normans]] who brought over the apple cider craft. Sizable [[orchard]]s developed in the region of New France, particularly on [[Île d'Orléans]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sulpicians]], who settled on the [[Island of Montreal]] in 1657, possessed, beginning in 1666, a little orchard inside the fenced garden of the [[seminary]] on [[Notre-Dame Street]]. A bigger orchard was planted on the side of [[Mount Royal]], in the mid-1670s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; On this site, the ''mission de la Montagne'' where [[Marguerite Bourgeoys]] had her school, they erected a fort, in 1685, where they were using two [[cider press]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1705, the production of cider was about 30 barrels, and part was sold outside the religious community.

In 1731, the orchards covered {{convert|90|arpent|acre|lk=in|1}} on the Island of Montreal, on the side of the mountain and around town.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1731 to 1781, the surface area occupied by the orchards rose from {{convert|90|to|402|arpent|km2}}. The common cultivars at the time were the [[Calville blanc]], [[Calville rouge]], [[Famous (apple)|Famous]], [[Reinette]], [[Bourassa (apple)|Bourassa]], [[Pomme blanche]], [[Pomme grise]] of Montreal&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sauvageon.&lt;ref&gt;Suzel Brunel (dir.) ''[http://www.cbcq.gouv.qc.ca/mont_royal.html Étude de caractérisation de l'arrondissement historique et naturel du Mont-Royal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201110610/http://www.cbcq.gouv.qc.ca/mont_royal.html |date=December 1, 2008 }}'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; These cultivars have been supplanted by others since.

The [[British Conquest]] of 1760, confirmed by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|cession of 1763]], brought along all kinds of changes in the habits of French Canadians. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]'s protectionist trade policy, limiting exchanges within the British Empire, favoured the importation of alcohols from England ([[whisky]], [[gin]]) and [[Antilles]] ([[rum]]), and discouraged all the [[artisan]]al productions of the inhabitants. Only beer, produced by industrialists from Great Britain (or of British origin), expanded significantly in the 19th century.

On August 15, 1807, in ''[[Le Canadien]]'' of [[Quebec City]], there was an article in which the author deplored that more efforts were not made to encourage the cultivation of apples on Île d'Orléans and to export cider, which he judged "superior or at least equal to that of Europe and the United States". He suggested also that the production could serve to diminish the excessive consumption of rum, a "source of disastrous ruins in a lot of families."&lt;ref&gt;Brunel, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artisanal production of cider continued until the period of [[alcohol prohibition|prohibition]] on alcohol in the middle of the 1910s. In April 1919, a great majority of Quebecers (78.62%) voted yes in a [[Quebec referendum on the prohibition of alcohol|Quebec referendum]] asking them if "beer, ciders, and light wines" should be allowed, as excluded from the list of prohibited alcoholic beverages. However, in 1920, a legislative omission rendered cider illegal in the territory of Quebec. Indeed, the Canadian ''[[Alcoholic Beverages Act]]'' which ended prohibition and created the monopoly of the ''[[Société des alcools du Québec|Commission des liqueurs du Québec]]'', did not legislate on cider, which consequently found itself in a judicial void. It was only in 1970, half a century later, that the situation was corrected. During this period, cider continued to be produced by several apple growers, but they were not legally permitted to sell it.

When cider became legal again, Quebecers were served a cider produced industrially, which was disliked very much by many and gave it a bad reputation. Makers were unable to supply to the demand and inundated the market with products that had no maturity.&lt;ref name="Historique"&gt;ACAQ. "[http://www.cidreduquebec.com/Historique.htm Historique] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323183213/http://www.cidreduquebec.com/Historique.htm |date=March 23, 2008 }}", in the site of the ''Association des cidriculteurs artisans du Québec'', retrieved November 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A whole generation experienced the [[Grand Sec d'Orléans]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K65koh6er1U Pub Québec - Le grand sec d'Orléans&amp;nbsp;: bon comme c'est pas permis]", in ''YouTube'', November 13, 2008 (1975 TV advertising)&lt;/ref&gt; which to many, evoked what is most undrinkable when it comes to alcohol. Sales declined after a few years, and cider, barely gotten out of its "dark age", was plunged back into it. From about {{convert|1000000|impgal}} a year in 1971, the production dropped to {{convert|300000|impgal}} per year in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Gilles Jutras. "[http://www.planete.qc.ca/jutras/decouverte/decouverte-2242003-56109.html Jean-Gilles Jutras à la découverte : Le cidre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706201549/http://www.planete.qc.ca/jutras/decouverte/decouverte-2242003-56109.html |date=July 6, 2011 }}", in ''Planète Québec'', April 22, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It was only at the end of the 1980s when the first craft production permits were issued by the ''Régie des alcools, des courses et des jeux du Québec'', that Quebec cider was truly reborn, about the same time as beer and wine, for the same reason.&lt;ref name="Historique"/&gt;

The ciders crafted by small cider makers then multiplied, often avoiding to use the word ''cidre'' on the bottle to avoid alarming the consumers.&lt;ref&gt;VinoTV. "[http://www.vinotv.ca/spip/spip.php?page=chroniquearticle&amp;id_article=122 Christian Barthomeuf, du Clos Saragnat : un pionnier de la production de cidre de glace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212427/http://www.vinotv.ca/spip/spip.php?page=chroniquearticle&amp;id_article=122 |date=2011-07-06 }}" (a pioneer in production of ice cider), in ''VinoTV.ca'', September 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The first Quebec [[ice cider]] was crafted by [[Christian Barthomeuf]] in [[Dunham, Quebec|Dunham]] in the [[Eastern Townships]]&lt;ref&gt;Clos Saragnat. "[http://www.saragnat.com/french.html Un peu d'histoire...] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207083113/http://www.saragnat.com/french.html |date=December 7, 2008 }}", in the site of the ''Clos Saragnat'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt; during the winter of 1989–1990. The first bottles bear the "1990" ''[[millésime]]''. Ten years later, cider makers obtained the authorization to name their products ''cidre de glace'' (ice cider). A regulation on cider was finally adopted by the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;LaTerre.ca "[http://www.laterre.ca/?action=detailNouvelle&amp;menu=&amp;section=manchette&amp;idArticle=5732 Le Règlement sur le cidre adopté]", in ''LaTerre.ca'', November 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ANQ. ''[http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=3&amp;file=/S_13/S13R1.HTM Règlement sur le cidre. Loi sur la Société des alcools du Québec]'', Éditeur officiel du Québec, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Quebec cider makers prepare various types of ciders, which are categorized according to the production method, the percentage of alcohol, the [[Effervescence (chemistry)|effervescence]], or the residual sugar content.&lt;ref name="Terr"&gt;SAQ. "[http://www.saq.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/GeneralContentView?page=/nh/section5_parlons-vins-alcools/terroirs-du-quebec/pommes-z&amp;langId=-2&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10001 Terroirs du Québec. Pommes]" (apples), in ''SAQ.com'', retrieved October 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cider is said to be ''light'' when it contains 7% of alcohol or less, ''strong'' when it contains 7% to 13%, and ''[[apéritif]]'' when between 13% to 20%. ''Flavoured'' cider, perfumed with aromas of [[berries]], [[honey]] or [[sugar maple|maple]], generally contains less than 10% alcohol.

As it is with wine, cider can be ''[[Sparkling wine|still]]'' (without bubble) or ''[[Sparkling wine|sparkling]]'' (with bubbles).

Sparkling apple cider is crafted either by injecting [[carbon dioxide]], in ''closed vats'' using the [[Sparkling wine production|Charmat process]] or the traditional ''[[Sparkling wine production|champenoise]]'' method. The result is a cider said to be ''semi-sparkling'' when in impregnated naturally with carbon dioxide, under low pressure (less than {{convert|2|atm}}), ''carbonated semi-sparkling'' when impregnated artificially with carbon dioxide, also under low pressure. It is ''sparkling'' when impregnated naturally with carbon dioxide under a pressure between {{convert|3|to|5|atm}} and ''carbonated sparkling'', if artificially impregnated with carbon dioxide under of the same pressure of {{convert|3|to|5|atm}}.&lt;ref name=Terr/&gt;

Apple [[mistelle]] is a cider obtained from a [[must]] kept fresh, that is unfermented, to which alcohol is added.

[[Ice cider]], an innovation from Quebec,&lt;ref name=Terr/&gt; is crafted by pressing apples naturally frozen by winter's cold. Similar to the [[late harvest]] of grapes, apples picked during winter allow for a must with a high sugar content, when water, turned into ice, is separated from the apples. This step is called the ''cryoconcentration'' of sugar.&lt;ref&gt;La face cachée de la pomme. "[http://www.cidredeglace.com/cryoconcentration.html cryoconcentration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616081449/http://www.cidredeglace.com/cryoconcentration.html |date=2009-06-16 }}", in the site of ''La face cachée de la pomme'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The final result, after the fermentation of the must, is a [[liqueur]]-like and mellow liquid, containing between 9 and 13% of alcohol.

== Regions ==
Quebec counts six cider-producing regions, which correspond more or less with its apple-producing regions: the [[Montérégie]], [[Eastern Townships]], [[Chaudière-Appalaches]], the [[Laurentides]], [[Charlevoix]], and [[Capitale-Nationale]].

== Apples ==
Cultivation of apples is well developed in Quebec, which produces in quantity several cultivars of apples, the [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]], [[Paula Red]], [[Spartan (apple)|Spartan]], [[Cortland (apple)|Cortland]], [[Empire (apple)|Empire]], [[Vista Bella]] and [[Jersey Mac]] being among the most common.&lt;ref&gt;FPPQ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9487">'''Saw palmetto extract''' is an extract of the fruit of the  [[Serenoa|saw palmetto]]. It is marketed as a treatment for [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH), but reviews of clinical trials, including those conducted by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], found it ineffective for this purpose.&lt;ref name=Cochrane&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tacklind J, Macdonald R, Rutks I, Stanke JU, Wilt TJ |title=Serenoa repens for benign prostatic hyperplasia |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=12 |issue= |pages=CD001423 |year=2012 |pmid=23235581 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001423.pub3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical ==

=== Historical and folk medicine===
Saw palmetto is used in several forms of traditional [[herbal medicine]]. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] used the fruit for food and to treat a variety of [[Urinary system|urinary]] and [[reproductive system]] problems. The [[Maya civilization|Mayans]] drank it as a tonic, and the [[Seminole]]s used the berries as an [[expectorant]] and [[antiseptic]].&lt;ref name="Mayo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/saw-palmetto/NS_patient-sawpalmetto |title=Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens [Bartram] Small)] |accessdate=2011-12-15 |publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Although saw palmetto extract has been claimed to be a herbal remedy for [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH), it is an ineffective treatment.&lt;ref name=Cochrane/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16467543"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bent S, Kane C, Shinohara K, etal |title=Saw palmetto for benign prostatic hyperplasia |journal=N.

Limited ''in vitro'' and animal model studies have investigated potential for use in the treatment of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="pmid19059205"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scholtysek C, Krukiewicz AA, Alonso JL, Sharma KP, Sharma PC, Goldmann WH |title=Characterizing components of the Saw Palmetto Berry Extract (SPBE) on prostate cancer cell growth and traction |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=379 |issue=3 |pages=795–8 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19059205 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.11.114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16093232"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson ML |title=A preliminary investigation of the enzymatic inhibition of 5alpha-reduction and growth of prostatic carcinoma cell line LNCap-FGC by natural [[astaxanthin]] and Saw Palmetto lipid extract in vitro |journal=Journal of Herbal Pharmacotherapy |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=17–26 |year=2005 |pmid=16093232 |doi=10.1300/J157v05n01_03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the [[American Cancer Society]], "available scientific studies do not support claims that saw palmetto can prevent or treat prostate cancer in humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/herbsvitaminsandminerals/saw-palmetto|title=Saw Palmetto|date=28 November 2008|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Beta-sitosterol, a chemical present in saw palmetto extract, is chemically similar to cholesterol. In one trial, high levels of serum sitosterol correlated with increased risk of heart attack.&lt;ref name="Nutr"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Assmann G, Cullen P, Erbey J, Ramey DR, Kannenberg F, Schulte H |title=Plasma sitosterol elevations are associated with increased incidence of coronary events in men: results of a nested case-control analysis of the Prospective Cardiovascular Münster (PROCAM) study |journal=Nutrition, Metabolism, and Cardiovascular Diseases : NMCD |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=13–21 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16399487 |doi=10.1016/j.numecd.2005.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a meta-analysis of 17 trials saw no connection between serum sitosterol status and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Genser B, Silbernagel G, De Backer G, Bruckert E, Carmena R, Chapman MJ, Deanfield J, Descamps OS, Rietzschel ER, Dias KC, März W |title=Plant sterols and cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Eur.

==Precautions and contraindications==

===Children===
The use of saw palmetto extract is not recommended in children under 12 years old because it may affect the metabolism of [[androgen]] and [[estrogen]] hormones.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|title=Fructus Serenoae Repentis|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4927e/28.html|website=WHO Monographs on Selected Medicinal Plants|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Saw palmetto extract should not be used during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; The effects of saw palmetto extract on androgen and estrogen metabolism can potentially impair [[fetal genital development]].&lt;ref name="Natural Standard" /&gt; Saw palmetto extract should also be avoided during breastfeeding due to a lack of available information.&lt;ref name="Natural Standard" /&gt;

===Surgery and bleeding risk===
In a case report, a patient taking saw palmetto extract had increased bleeding time during surgery. Bleeding time returned to normal after stopping taking the herb.&lt;ref name=Anticoagulant&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheema|first1=P|last2=El-Mefty|first2=O|last3=Jazieh|first3=AR|title=Intraoperative haemorrhage associated with the use of extract of Saw Palmetto herb: a case report and review of literature|journal=J Intern Med|date=Aug 2001|volume=250|issue=2|pages=167–9|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2796.2001.00851.x|pmid=11489067}}&lt;/ref&gt; One clinical trial pre-treated prostate surgery patients with saw palmetto for five weeks prior to the surgery, because there was evidence from earlier literature that such pre-treatment reduced operative bleeding. The trial reported no improvement compared to placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tuncel A, Ener K, Han O, Nalcacioglu V, Aydin O, Seckin S, Atan A |title=Effects of short-term dutasteride and Serenoa repens on perioperative bleeding and microvessel density in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate |journal=Scand. J. Urol. Nephrol. |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=377–82 |year=2009 |pmid=19921983 |doi=10.3109/00365590903164498 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general rule surgeons should ask patients to discontinue dietary supplements prior to scheduled surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang CZ, Moss J, Yuan CS |title=Commonly Used Dietary Supplements on Coagulation Function during Surgery |journal=Medicines (Basel) |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=157–185 |year=2015 |pmid=26949700 |pmc=4777343 |doi=10.3390/medicines2030157 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interactions==
Saw palmetto extract may decrease the effectiveness of estrogen products by reducing estrogen levels in the body via its antiestrogenic effects.&lt;ref name="Natural Standard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saw Palmetto|url=https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/s/saw-palmetto/professional.aspx|website=Natural Standard: The Authority on Integrative Medicine|publisher=Natural Standard|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can interfere with the use of birth control pills that contain estrogen as an active ingredient. As a result, it is recommended that an additional form of birth control, such as a condom, be used to prevent pregnancy in patients taking birth control pills with saw palmetto extract. In addition, saw palmetto extract can also interfere with hormone replacement therapy by reducing the effectiveness of estrogen pills. The combination of saw palmetto extract with estrogen products should be used with caution.&lt;ref name="Natural Standard" /&gt;

When used in combination with an [[anticoagulant]] or [[Antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet]] drug, saw palmetto extract can increase the risk of bleeding by enhancing the anticoagulation or antiplatelet effects. Some examples of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs include aspirin, [[clopidogrel]], [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs|nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)]] and [[warfarin]]. Therefore, the combination of saw palmetto extract with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs should be used with caution.&lt;ref name="Natural Standard" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Scbb 134.jpg|thumb|right|SCBB lab technologist processing a cord blood unit]] --&gt;
The '''Singapore Cord Blood Bank''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''SCBB''') is [[Singapore]]’s only public [[cord blood bank]] that collects, processes and stores donated umbilical cord blood for use in stem cell transplants. Its cord blood units may be searched for use by qualifying transplant centers around the world.

== Public Cord Blood Banking ==
As a public cord blood bank, SCBB does not charge cord blood donors for its services. However, as the cord blood is donated altruistically, the donor relinquishes any claims to it after donation. This contrasts with a private cord blood bank where parents pay a fee for the cord blood banking services, but retain ownership over the use of their cord blood.

== Cord blood and its uses ==
[[Cord blood]] is the blood that circulates through the [[umbilical cord]] from the foetus to the placenta. After delivery, the placenta is almost always thrown away. Yet this humble umbilical cord has become a life saving and precious commodity, because cord blood is rich in blood [[stem cells]].

Blood stem cells are young or immature cells that can transform into other forms of essential blood cell types ([[pluripotent]]), such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. The use of blood stem cells has emerged as a potentially curative option for the treatment of several diseases, including blood cancers (such as [[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]]), and severe [[anaemia]] (such as [[myelodysplastic syndrome]], [[thalassemia major]] and severe [[aplastic anaemia]]).

== History ==
Officially opened in September 2005 by Health Minister Mr. Khaw Boon Wan, Singapore Cord Blood Bank was established in response to demands from Haematologists and Paediatricians in Singapore.

Singaporean patients who needed stem cell transplants were then facing difficulties in obtaining [[Human Leukocyte Antigen]] (HLA) matched stem cell units because of the relative scarcity of stem cell donors that matched Singapore’s main ethnic profiles i.e. Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnicities. SCBB was conceived as a solution to this problem. Donation of cord blood by Singaporeans would significantly increase the probability of obtaining matched cord blood units for the treatment of Singaporean patients.

Having joined the WMDA and NMDP network in 2006 and 2007 respectively, SCBB allows patients of Asian descent all over the world to search SCBB's inventory for a matching cord blood unit as well.

== Mission ==
The expressed mission of the SCBB is to provide placental cord blood units of high safety and quality, through the practice of internationally accredited techniques of collection, processing, banking and disposition, in order to support cord blood transplantations and related research in Singapore and around the world.

== Corporate Governance ==
SCBB is registered in Singapore as a [[company limited by guarantee]]. It has a not-for-profit charter and is governed by a non-executive board of directors. Chaired by ''Prof Tan Ser Kiat'' the board's members include ''Mr Gregory Vijayendran, Mr Markham Shaw, Dr Chong Tsung Wen, Dr Mary Rauff and A/Prof Allen Yeoh''.

== Management ==
Chief Executive Officer, ''Mrs Tan-Huang Shuo Mei'', leads the management team of SCBB, having taken over the reins from ''Mr Steven J Sobak'' in July 2015. ''Mr Sobak'' helmed as SCBB’s CEO from 2007 to 2015, and ''Dr Fidah Alsagoff'' was SCBB’s founding Executive Director from inception to early 2007. The Medical Director is ''Dr William Hwang'' and the Senior Manager-Operations who takes care of the daily operations is ''Mr Arun Prasath''.

== Location ==
The laboratory and cryo-storage area of SCBB is located at Basement 1 of the [[KK Women's and Children's Hospital]]. SCBB has an administrative office at Novena Specialist Centre.

== Collection Centres ==
SCBB currently collects cord blood from three public hospitals, namely [[KK Women's and Children's Hospital]], [[National University Hospital]] and [[Singapore General Hospital]], as well as all 7 of the private obstetric hospitals in Singapore, [[Gleneagles Hospital]], [[Mount Alvernia Hospital]], [[Mount Elizabeth Hospital]], [[Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital]], [[Parkway East Hospital]],  [[Raffles Hospital]] and [[Thomson Medical Centre]].

'''Somatic fusion''', also called '''protoplast fusion''', is a type of [[genetic modification]] in plants by which two distinct species of plants are fused together to form a new [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] plant with the characteristics of both, a '''somatic hybrid'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Somatic Cell Hybridization|first1=K.

Uses of somatic fusion include making potato plants resistant to [[Potato leafroll virus|potato leaf roll disease]].&lt;ref&gt;

#   The removal of the cell wall of one cell of each type of plant using [[cellulase]] enzyme to produce a [[somatic cell]] called a [[protoplast]]
#   The cells are then fused using electric shock (electrofusion) or chemical treatment to join the cells and fuse together the nuclei. The resulting fused [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] is called [[heterokaryon]].
#   The somatic hybrid cell then has its cell wall induced to form using [[hormone]]s
#   The cells are then grown into [[Callus (cell biology)|calluses]] which then are further grown to [[plantlet]]s and finally to a full plant, known as a somatic hybrid.

Different from the procedure for seed plants describe above, fusion of [[moss]] protoplasts can be initiated without electric shock but by the use of [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG). Further, moss protoplasts do not need [[phytohormone]]s for [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], and they do not form a [[Callus (cell biology)|callus]].&lt;ref&gt;Solvey Rother, Birgit Hadeler, José M.

==Applications in animal cells==

[[Somatic cell]]s of different types can be fused to obtain hybrid cells. Hybrid cells are useful in a variety of ways, e.g.,

(i) to study the control of [[cell division]] and [[gene expression]],

(ii) to investigate [[malignant transformation]]s,

(iii) to obtain [[viral replication]],

(iv) for [[Gene mapping|gene]] or [[chromosome map]]ping and for

(v) production of [[monoclonal antibodies]] by producing [[Hybridoma technology|hybridoma]] (hybrid cells between an immortalised cell and an [[antibody]] producing [[lymphocyte]]), etc.

Chromosome mapping through somatic cell hybridization is essentially based on fusion of human and [[mouse]] somatic cells. Generally, human [[fibrocyte]]s or [[White blood cells|leucocytes]] are fused with mouse continuous [[cell line]]s.

When human and mouse cells (or cells of any two [[mammal]]ian species or of the same species) are mixed, spontaneous [[cell fusion]] occurs at a very low rate (10-6). Cell fusion is enhanced 100 to 1000 times by the addition of [[ultraviolet]] inactivated [[Sendai virus|Sendai]] (parainfluenza) virus or [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG).

These agents adhere to the [[plasma membrane]]s of cells and alter their properties in such a way that facilitates their fusion. Fusion of two cells produces a heterokaryon, i.e., a single hybrid cell with two nuclei, one from each of the cells entering fusion. Subsequently, the two nuclei also fuse to yield a hybrid cell with a single nucleus.

A generalized scheme for somatic cell hybridization may be described as follows. Appropriate human and mouse cells are selected and mixed together in the presence of inactivated Sendai virus or PEG to promote cell fusion. After a period of time, the cells (a mixture of man, mouse and 'hybrid' cells) are plated on a [[selective medium]], e.g., [[HAT medium]], which allows the [[multiplication]] of hybrid cells only.

Several [[clone (cell biology)|clone]]s (each derived from a single hybrid cell) of the hybrid cells are thus isolated and subjected to both [[Cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] and appropriate [[Biochemical analysis|biochemical analyses]] for the detection of [[enzyme]]/ [[protein]]/[[trait (biology)|trait]] under investigation. An attempt is now made to correlate the presence and absence of the trait with the presence and absence of a [[human chromosome]] in the hybrid clones.

If there is a perfect [[correlation]] between the presence and absence of a human chromosome and that of a trait in the hybrid clones, the gene governing the trait is taken to be located in the concerned chromosome.

The HAT medium is one of the several selective media used for the selection of hybrid cells. This medium is supplemented with [[hypoxanthine]], [[aminopterin]] and [[thymidine]], hence the name HAT medium. [[Antimetabolite]] aminopterin blocks the cellular [[biosynthesis]] of [[purine]]s and [[pyrimidine]]s from [[simple sugar]]s and [[amino acid]]s.

However, normal human and mouse cells can still multiply as they can utilize hypoxanthine and thymidine present in the medium through a [[salvage pathway]], which ordinarily recycles the purines and pyrimidines produced from degradation of [[nucleic acid]]s.

Hypoxanthine is converted into [[guanine]] by the enzyme [[hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase]] (HGPRT), while thymidine is [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] by [[thymidine kinase]] (TK); both HGPRT and TK are enzymes of the salvage pathway.

On a HAT medium, only those cells that have active HGPRT (HGPRT+) and TK (TK+) enzymes can proliferate, while those deficient in these enzymes (HGPRr- and/or TK-) can not divide (since they cannot produce purines and pyrimidines due to the aminopterin present in the HAT medium).

For using HAT medium as a selective agent, [[human cell]]s used for fusion must be deficient for either the enzyme HGPRT or TK, while mouse cells must be deficient for the other enzyme of this pair. Thus, one may fuse HGPRT deficient human cells (designated as TK+ HGPRr-) with TK deficient mouse cells (denoted as TK- HGPRT+).

Their fusion products (hybrid cells) will be TK+ (due to the human [[gene]]) and HGPRT+ (due to the mouse gene) and will multiply on the HAT medium, while the man and mouse cells will fail to do so. Experiments with other selective media can be planned in a similar fashion.

==Characteristics of somatic hybridization and cybridization ==

# Somatic cell fusion appears to be the only means through which two different parental [[genome]]s can be [[Genetic recombination|recombined]] among plants that cannot [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]] (asexual or sterile).
# Protoplasts of sexually sterile ([[haploid]], [[triploid]], and [[aneuploid]]) plants can be fused to produce fertile [[diploid]]s and [[polyploid]]s.
# Somatic cell fusion overcomes sexual incompatibility barriers. In some cases somatic hybrids between two incompatible plants have also found application in [[industry]] or [[agriculture]].
# Somatic cell fusion is useful in the study of cytoplasmic genes and their activities and this information can be applied in [[plant breeding]] experiments.

'''Ṭam Dil''' is a [[reservoir]] lake situated 6&amp;nbsp;km from [[Saitual]], the nearest town, and 64&amp;nbsp;km from [[Aizawl]], the capital city of [[Mizoram]], [[India]]. In [[Mizo language]], the word ''Ṭam'' is a [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of ''anṭam'', which means a [[mustard plant]]; and ''Dil'' means "lake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=K. C.

==Origin==

The origin and [[etymology]] of Ṭam Dil are shrouded in [[myth]]. [[Folklore]] has it that a married couple had a [[Slash-and-burn|jhum plot]] in this small valley surrounded by small steep hills. The man unfortunately died leaving the wife to care for the crops alone. In the middle of the field  was a robust mustard plant, conspicuously bigger than any other plants. One night the widow has a [[Apparitional experience|visitation]] by her husband, who informed her to take special care of the giant mustard plant as it was a harbinger of immense blessing. On the wake, she did as told, and the plant thrived very well. As time went, the widow remarried but the new husband objected to any thing reminiscence of the deceased husband, and so he plucked the plant up by the roots and discarded it. The vast hole left in the ground was then soon filled by water (seeping from the plant, according to some versions; from the ground itself, in another version) to become an exquisite lake. Hence the name of Ṭam Dil, for the "lake of the mustard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Travel Adda |title= Mizoram attraction: Lakes|year= 2011| url= http://www.traveladda.com/east_india/mizoram/information/lakes.html  |work= traveladda.com |publisher= |accessdate= 2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Caper |title= Lakes in Mizoram|date= | url= http://www.capertravelindia.com/mizoram/lakes-mizoram.html  |work=  capertravelindia.com|publisher= CAPER TRAVEL COMPANY(P) LTD.|accessdate= 2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Department of Tourism|title=Tam Dil |year= 2012| url= http://tourism.mizoram.gov.in/page/tam-dil-13-01-08.html  |work= tourism.mizoram.gov.in |publisher= Government of Mizoram|accessdate= 2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tany Yao''' (born 1971) is a Canadian politician who was elected in the [[Alberta general election, 2015]] to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], representing the [[electoral district]] of [[Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/includes/provincialelections/albertavotes2015/dashboard/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/fresh-faces-in-the-wildrose-opposition|title=Fresh faces in the Wildrose Opposition|work=Edmonton Journal|date=May 9, 2015|accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015 election, Yao defeated Progressive Conservative candidate [[Mike Allen (Alberta politician)|Mike Allen]].

In July 2017, Yao remained the MLA for Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo under the establishment of The [[United Conservative Party]] (UCP). The UCP is a political party which forms the official opposition in Alberta, Canada. It was established in July 2017 as a merger between the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta and the Wildrose Party.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnews.ca/news/3623311/united-conservative-party-selects-interim-caucus-leadership-team/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Yao was born in [[Grand Falls, New Brunswick]] and moved to [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]] in 1977 at the age of six. His father, Joseph Yao, was originally from [[Cebu]] in the [[Philippines]] and eventually worked as a doctor in Fort McMurray.[https://www.dfa.gov.ph/dfa-news/news-from-our-foreign-service-postsupdate/14102-consul-general-torres-meets-mlas-nathan-cooper-and-tany-yao] His mother, Keiko, was a nurse within the community. 

Yao graduated from Fort McMurray Composite High School in 1989 and enrolled in the EMT program at [[Portage College]] in [[Lac La Biche, Alberta]]. Ultimately he went on to become a paramedic at [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology|NAIT]] in [[Edmonton]], Alberta. His first full-time job after graduating from NAIT was with the Alberta Central Air Ambulance in Lac La Biche. In 1997, Yao returned to Fort McMurray as a paramedic firefighter. He helped fight the House River Fire in 2002 and was the pump operator on the crew that saved the Abasand Apartment complex&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wildfirelessons.connectedcommunity.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=46169668-1577-4316-aae0-c2414fe542e7|title=House River Fire 2002|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2007, Yao was promoted to Assistant Deputy Chief of Operations - EMS for the region of Wood Buffalo.

== Provincial Politics ==
Yao has always been an advocate for his community. However, it wasn't until late 2014 that Yao considered running for office. The [[Wildrose Party|Wildrose party]] was in disarray after leader [[Danielle Smith]] and eight other MLAs crossed the floor to the ruling [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]]. A [[Wildrose Party leadership election, 2015|leadership election]] was organized and Yao's long time friend [[Brian Jean]] was elected as the official leader of the Wildrose Party&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/brian-jean-enters-wildrose-leadership-race|title=Brian Jean enters Wildrose leadership race|date=2015-02-26|work=Calgary Herald|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Yao decided to run along side his good friend as a member of the Wildrose party and together represent the electoral districts of [[Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo|Fort McMurray- Wood Buffalo]] and [[Fort McMurray-Conklin|Fort McMurray- Conklin]]. 

The [[Alberta general election, 2015|2015 Alberta election]] was held on May 5, 2015. Yao was elected to represent the electoral district of [[Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo|Fort McMurray- Wood Buffalo]], defeating  [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]] candidate [[Mike Allen (Alberta politician)|Mike Allen]]. The party retained its standing as Official Opposition in the legislature, growing its caucus from 17 in [[Alberta general election, 2012|2012]], and 5 at dissolution, to 21. For the first time in Alberta history, the [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] formed government, with [[Rachel Notley]] becoming Premier. This marked the end of 43 years of government by the Progressive Conservatives.

On May 18, 2017, the Wildrose and the Progressive Conservatives announced that their two parties had come to a merger agreement and on July 22, 2017 the merger was passed with 95% support from both the PCs and the Wildrose. The merger agreement formed the [[United Conservative Party (Alberta)|United Conservative Party]], a leadership election occurred on October 28, 2017, in which [[Jason Kenney]] was chosen as the leader of the UCP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/alberta-conservative-unity-one-step-closer|title=Wildrose-PC members to vote on new united party July 22|date=2017-05-19|work=Edmonton Journal|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yao is now the UCP's official critic on Health and Emergency Response Preparedness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucpcaucus.ca/members/tany-yao/|title=Tany Yao {{!}}|work=UCP Caucus|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He takes his job seriously, continuously meeting with public and private health institutions, community members and groups, local businesses and the municipal government. The first words he ever spoke in the Alberta Legislature were about his concerns on senior support in the Wood Buffalo Region &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Alberta Legislature|title=041 Maiden Speech - Tany Yao|date=2016-06-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjegP3knyv0|accessdate=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

'''Testicular trauma''' is an injury to one or both [[testicle]]s. Types of injuries include blunt, penetrating and degloving.

Because the testes are located within the [[scrotum]], which hangs outside of the body, they do not have the protection of muscles and bones. This makes it easier for a testes to be struck, hit, kicked or crushed, which occurs most often during [[contact sport]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} Testicles can be protected by wearing [[Protective cup#Protective cup|athletic cups]] during sports.

Trauma to the testes can cause severe pain, bruising, swelling, and/or in severe cases even possible infertility. In most cases, the testes—which is spongy—can absorb some impact without serious damage. A rare type of testicular trauma, called [[testicular rupture]], occurs when the testicle receives a direct blow or is squeezed against the hard bones of the pelvis. This injury can cause blood to leak into the scrotum and possibly even infertility and other complications. In severe cases, surgery to repair the rupture—and thus save the testicle—may be necessary.

In at least one case, testicular trauma was reported as the cause of a patient developing [[Systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] (SIRS) despite otherwise minor trauma.&lt;ref&gt;KC Okonkwo, KL Wong and L Gilmer. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2438311/ Testicular trauma resulting in shock and systemic inflammatory response syndrome: a case report]. ''PubMed'' Cases J. 2008; 1:4. {{doi|10.1186/1757-1626-1-4}}. {{PMC|2438311}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toxiferine''' (C-toxiferine I) is a [[curare]] [[toxin]].  It is a bisindole alkaloid derived from ''Strychnos toxifera'' and a [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] [[nicotinic antagonist|antagonist]]. This alkaloid is the main toxic component of Calabash curare, and one of the most toxic plant alkaloids known to man. The lethal dose (LD&lt;small&gt;50&lt;/small&gt;) for mice has been determined as 10 - 60 µg/kg by [[intravenous]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;https://roempp.thieme.de/roempp4.0/do/data/RD-20-02260 C-Toxiferine I, German&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a [[muscle relaxant]] that causes [[muscle paralysis|paralysis]] of [[skeletal muscle]], which takes approximately 2 hours to recovery for a moderate dose, and 8 hours of total paralysis with a 20-fold paralytic dose. The paralysis can be antagonized by [[Neostigmine]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R8BlpSvvSfwC&amp;pg=PA330 Page 330] in: {{cite book |author= |title=The Alkaloids: v. 1: A Review of Chemical Literature (Specialist Periodical Reports) |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |location=Cambridge, Eng |year=1971 |pages= |isbn=0-85186-257-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''uterine microbiome''' is the [[Commensalism|commensal]], [[nonpathogenic organisms|nonpathogenic]], [[bacteria]], viruses, yeasts/fungi present in a [[healthy]] [[uterus]], [[amniotic fluid]] and [[endometrium]] and the specific [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] which they inhabit. It has been only recently confirmed that the uterus and its [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] are not [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]].&lt;ref name="Per2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perez-Muñoz|first1=Maria Elisa|last2=Arrieta|first2=Marie-Claire|last3=Ramer-Tait|first3=Amanda E.|last4=Walter|first4=Jens|title=A critical assessment of the “sterile womb” and “in utero colonization” hypotheses: implications for research on the pioneer infant microbiome|journal=Microbiome|volume=5|issue=1|year=2017|issn=2049-2618|doi=10.1186/s40168-017-0268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to improved [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA gene]] [[sequencing]] techniques, detection of bacteria that are present in low numbers is possible.&lt;ref name="Verstrael6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstraelen|first1=Hans|last2=Vilchez-Vargas|first2=Ramiro|last3=Desimpel|first3=Fabian|last4=Jauregui|first4=Ruy|last5=Vankeirsbilck|first5=Nele|last6=Weyers|first6=Steven|last7=Verhelst|first7=Rita|last8=De Sutter|first8=Petra|last9=Pieper|first9=Dietmar H.|last10=Van De Wiele|first10=Tom|title=Characterisation of the human uterine microbiome in non-pregnant women through deep sequencing of the V1-2 region of the 16S rRNA gene|journal=PeerJ|volume=4|year=2016|pages=e1602|issn=2167-8359|doi=10.7717/peerj.1602|pmid=26823997|pmc=4730988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Using this procedure that allows the detection of bacteria that cannot be [[Microbiological culture|culture]]d outside the body, studies of [[microbiota]] present in the uterus are expected to increase.&lt;ref name="WassenaarPanigrahi2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wassenaar|first1=T.M.|last2=Panigrahi|first2=P.|title=Is a foetus developing in a sterile environment?|journal=Letters in Applied Microbiology|volume=59|issue=6|year=2014|pages=572–579|issn=0266-8254|doi=10.1111/lam.12334|PMID=25273890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

Bacteria, [[virus]]es and one [[genus]] of [[yeast]]s are a normal part of the uterus before and during [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="PayneBayatibojakhi2014"/&gt; The uterus has been found to possess its own characteristic microbiome that differs significantly from the [[List of microbiota species of the lower reproductive tract of women|vaginal microbiome]]. Despite its close spatial connection with the vagina, the microbiome of the uterus more closely resembles the commensal bacteria found in the [[Oral microbiology|oral cavity]]. 
In addition, the [[List of antimicrobial peptides in the female reproductive tract|immune system]] is able to differentiate between those bacteria normally found in the uterus and those that are pathogenic. [[Hormone|Hormonal]] changes have an effect on the microbiota of the uterus.&lt;ref name="YarbroughWinkle2014"/&gt;&lt;!--{{cite journal|last1=Yarbrough|first1=V.

== Clinical significance ==
Prophylactic antibiotics have been injected into the uterus to treat infertility. This has been done before the transfer of embryos with the intent to improve implantation rates. No association exists between successful implantation and antibiotic treatment.&lt;ref name="FranasiakScott2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Franasiak|first1=Jason M.|last2=Scott|first2=Richard T.|title=Reproductive tract microbiome in assisted reproductive technologies|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=104|issue=6|year=2015|pages=1364–1371|issn=0015-0282|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2015.10.012|pmid=26597628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infertility treatments often progress to the point where a microbiological analysis of the uterine microbiota is performed. Preterm birth is associated with certain species of bacteria that are not normally part of the healthy uterine microbiome.&lt;ref name="PayneBayatibojakhi2014" /&gt;

== Immune response ==

The immune response becomes more pronounced when bacteria are found that are not commensal.&lt;ref name="PayneBayatibojakhi2014" /&gt;

==History==
Investigations into reproductive-associated microbiomes began around 1885 by [[Theodor Escherich]]. He wrote that meconium from the newborn was free of bacteria. There was a general consensus at the time and even recently that the uterus was sterile and this was referred to as the ''sterile womb paradigm.'' Other investigations used sterile diapers for meconium collection. No bacteria were able to be cultured from the samples. Other studies showed that bacteria were detected and were directly proportional to the time between birth and the passage of meconium.&lt;ref name="Per2017"/&gt;

==Research==
Investigations into the role of the uterine microbiome in the development of the infant microbiome are ongoing.&lt;ref name = Per2017/&gt;

'''White Cane Safety Day''' is a national observance in the [[United States]], celebrated on October 15 of each year since 1964. The date is set aside to celebrate the achievements of people who are [[blindness|blind or visually impaired]] and the important symbol of blindness and tool of independence, the [[white cane]].

On October 6, 1964, a joint resolution of the [[U.S. Congress]], {{USBill|88|HR|753}}, was signed into law as {{USPL|88|628}}, and codified at {{USC|36|142}}. This resolution authorized the President of the United States to proclaim October 15 of each year as "White Cane Safety Day".

President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the first White Cane Safety Day proclamation within hours of the passage of the [[joint resolution]].

In 2011, White Cane Safety Day was also named '''Blind Americans Equality Day''' by President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;Presidential Proclamation -- Blind Americans Equality Day, 2011
