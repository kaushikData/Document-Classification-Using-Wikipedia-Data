{{History of Greater Iran}}
The '''Afrighids''' (from 305 to 995 AD) ({{lang-fa|آفریغیان - آل آفریغ}}) were a native [[Khwarezmian language|Chorasmian]] [[Iranian people|Iranian]]&lt;ref name="BosworthIranica"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosworth|first=C. E.|title=ĀL-E AFRĪḠ|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/al-e-afrig-afrighid-dynasty-the-name-given-by-the-khwarazmian-scholar-abu-rayhan-biruni-to-the-dynasty-of-rulers-in|work=Encyclopædia Iranica|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.E. Bosworth, “The Ghaznavids” in History of Civilization: Central Asia in History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Volume IV: The Age of Achievement : A.D. 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century : Part One : The Historical Social and Economic Setting/edited by M.S. Asimov and C.E. Bosworth. Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1999, 485 pages. (Vol. IV, Pt. I). {{ISBN|81-208-1595-5}}. Excerpt from page 101: “The ancient Iranian kingdom of Khwarazm had been ruled until 995 by the old established line of Afrighids of Kath, but control subsequently passed to the new line of Khwarazm Shahs, the [[Ma'munids]] of Gurganj”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MuslimDynasties"&gt;Clifford Edmund Bosworth, The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual, Columbia University, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; dynasty who ruled over the ancient kingdom of [[Chorasmia]] until 995 AD. Over time, they were under the suzerainty of the [[Sassanid Empire]], the [[Hephthalite Empire]], the [[Göktürks|Göktürk Khaganate]], the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and the [[Samanids|Samanid Empire]].

==Sources==
[[Al-Biruni]], the native [[Khwarezmian language|Chorasmian]] scholar, mentions twenty-two members of the Afrighid dynasty for a total span of 690 years with an average rule of 31 years for each ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Iranica, “ĀL-E AFRĪḠ (Afrighid dynasty)” by C. E. Bosworth&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the Afrighids ruled from 305 AD, through the Arab conquests under Qotayba b. Moslem in 93/712, and up to their overthrow in 385/995 by the rising rival family of [[Ma'munids]]. The main source on the Afrighids prior to Islam is also Al-Biruni. Part of the reason for the gap in information about this dynasty is mentioned by Al-Biruni.

Al-Biruni states:
{{cquote|When [[Qutaibah bin Muslim|Qutaibah bin Moslem]] under the command of Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf was sent to [[Khwarazmia]] with a military expedition and conquered it for the second time, he swiftly killed whoever wrote in the [[Khwarezmian language|Khwarazmian native language]] and knew of the Khwarazmian heritage, history, and culture. He then killed all their [[Zoroastrian]] priests and burned and wasted their books, until gradually the illiterate only remained, who knew nothing of writing, and hence the region's history was mostly forgotten.}}

==Etymology==
It has been suggested that 'Afrigh' is the Arabicized of 'Abriz' in Persian (آبریز where water flows, a reference to the geography of [[Khwarazm]] and its abundant water). However, Dr. Parviz Azkai, in his annotations on Al-Biruni's ''Chronology of Ancient Nations'', explains that this is a popular etymology. Azkai explains that Afrigh was originally Ap-Air-ig meaning ''from the Aryan descent'': ''ap'' or ''af'' is the same in 'afrashtan' (Persian: افراشتن) to raise; ''air'' is the root meaning Aryan as seen in Iraj, and Eran/Iran (land of Aryan); and ''-ig'' is the suffix of relation in [[Iranian languages]] and cognate to '-ic' in English or '-ique' in [[French language|French]].

==Kingdom==
The ancient [[Iranian people|Iranian]] kingdom of [[Chorasmia|Khwarazm]] had been ruled until 995 by the old established line of Afrighids of Kath. Khwarazm, or the classical Chorasmia, was the well irrigated and rich agricultural region of lower [[Oxus]]. Surrounded by all sides by steppe land and desert, it was geographically isolated from other areas of civilization. This isolation allowed it to maintain a separate distinctive [[Iranian people|Iranian]] language and culture.&lt;ref name="MuslimDynasties" /&gt; [[Chorasmia|Khwarazm]] was one of the early areas of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] civilization, and the local Chorasmian historian, Al-Biruni traces civilization there beyond the first millennium BC.&lt;ref name="MuslimDynasties" /&gt; Before the 8th century, there had only been few ineffectual Arab raids on the fringes of [[Chorasmia]] from the directions of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxania]]. But in 712&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] was able to intervene in a civil war between the Afrighid Shah and his brother Khorrazad. Two [[Arab]] invasions lead to much destruction as Al-Biruni notes. Once the Arabs withdrew from their raid, the Shahs recovered power in Chorasmia and they continued to adhere to their ancestral faith, which according to Al-Biruni was [[Zoroastrianism]]. The local shahs continued to ally with local Iranian princes, [[Soghdian]] merchants and even [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] in order to resist the [[Arabs]].&lt;ref name="BosworthIranica" /&gt;

It thus came vaguely under Muslim suzerainty, but it was not until the end of the 8th century or the beginning of the 9th century that an Afrighid was first converted to Islam appearing with the popular convert’s name of ‘Abdallah (slave of God). In the course of the 10th century, the local family of the [[Ma'munids]] who were based in Gurganj, on the left bank of the Oxus grew in economic and political importance due to trade caravans. In 995, they violently overthrew the Afrighids of Kath and themselves assumed the traditional title of the Khwarazm Shah. Briefly, the area was under [[Samanid]] suzerainty, before it passed to Mahmud of Ghazna. From then on, Turco-Mongolian invasions and long rule by Turco-Mongol dynasties supplanted the [[Iranian people|Iranian]] character of the region&lt;ref name="MuslimDynasties"/&gt; although the title of Khwarizm Shah was maintained well up to the 15th century.&lt;ref name="MuslimDynasties"/&gt;

==Religion==
It is generally agreed that the Afrighids were [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] until the reign of [[Abdallah ibn Torkasbatha]] during the 9th century. However, their Zoroastrian beliefs differed from those in [[Sasanian Empire|Iran]] and were a mix between a local form of Khwarazmian Zoroastrianism and [[paganism]]. The Khwarazmians, like their [[Sogdia]]n relatives, also made rituals and sacrifices dedicated to the Iranian mythological hero [[Siyavash]] whom they appeared to worship, according to Tolstov, with regards to vegetation.

==Name of Rulers==
Only consonants of the pre-Islamic names are known with long vowels, since in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] script, the short vowels are not written and diacritic signs are used to clarify when required. After the conversion of 'Abdallah, all the names except possibly 'Eraq are [[Arabic]] and their pronunciation is known. Unfortunately, the manuscripts that have also come down have also suffered some corruption due to scribal errors,&lt;ref name="BosworthIranica" /&gt; since the [[Chorasmian language|Chorasmian]] names were incomprehensible for most non-natives. Al-Biruni himself utilizes the extra letters of [[Chorasmian language|Chorasmian]] which were not used in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] writings.

More is known about the dynasty in the Islamic era after the beginning of the 8th century and their conversion to Islam.

Name of the rulers given by the native [[Chorasmian language|Chorasmian]] speaker Al-Biruni, and modern scholars.&lt;ref name="BosworthIranica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Massignon, "Al-Biruni et la valeur internationale de la science arabe" in Al-Biruni Commemoration Volume, (Calcutta, 1951). pp 217-219. excerpt: In a celebrated preface to the book of Drugs, [[Biruni]] says: ''It is through the Arabic language that the sciences have been transmitted by means of translations from all parts of the world. They have been enhanced by the translation into the Arabic language and have as a result insinuated themselves into men's hearts, and the beauty of this language has commingled with these sciences in our veins and arteries. And if it is true that in all nations one likes to adorn oneself by using the language to which one has remained loyal, having become accustomed to using it with friends and companions according to need, I must judge for myself that in my '''native''' [[Khwarezmian language|Chorasmian]], science has as much as chance of becoming perpetuated as a camel has of facing [[Kaaba]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Historic Cities Programme''' (HCP) of the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]] (AKTC)] promotes the conservation and re-use of buildings and [[public spaces]] in historic cities of the [[Muslim World]]. HCP undertakes the restoration and rehabilitation of historic structures and public spaces in ways that can spur [[social development|social]], [[economic development|economic]] and [[cultural development]]. Individual projects go beyond technical restoration to address the questions of the social and environmental context, [[adaptive reuse]], institutional sustainability and training. In several countries, local [[Aga Khan Cultural Service]] companies have been formed to implement projects under the supervision of the HCSP headquarters in [[Geneva]].

==Role of the HCP==
The HCP works closely with all project [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]], including the community. The Programme is able to provide planning assistance to government and local conservation bodies. It provides technical expertise and can help to secure funding and resources by defining opportunities and approaches, preparing feasibility studies, and shaping proposals for submission to local investors and [[international agency|international agencies]].

It also participates in urban conservation and development efforts that focus on building clusters, public spaces between and around buildings, a district, or a historic town. These projects aim to restore and maintain the [[socioeconomic]] and [[culture|cultural]] fabric of the designated area. The Programme also engages in restoring specific historic sites and buildings that include elements of urban landscape or single structures, for which appropriate new functions are developed to meet the social and [[economic]] needs of the respective communities.

The Programme is concerned with the long-term viability of its conservation projects and does support associated cultural initiatives in this regard. All enabling development factors – community support, innovative institutional structures, and commercial potential – are harnessed, whenever possible, to make conservation sustainable.

==Funding sources==
HCP plans and executes projects with funding from the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]] and other donors. Institutions, such as the [[Getty Grant Program]], [[World Monuments Fund]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation|Swiss]], [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation|Norwegian]] bilateral aid organisations, and the [[World Bank]] have sponsored or co-funded HCSP activities. HCSP establishes local service companies as partners in implementation and prepares them for autonomous operation as self-sustaining community organisations.

==Projects==
The Historic Cities Programme has been involved in nearly twenty distinct revitalisation projects in [[Afghanistan]], the [[Northern Areas]] of [[Pakistan]], [[Zanzibar]], [[Samarkand]], [[Cairo]], [[Mostar]] ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]), [[Mali]] and [[Syria]]. In all project locations, community participation, training of local professionals and local institution-building are essential components.

'''Altan Telgey''' is a [[Mongol]] earth goddess. Her relationship to [[Etugen]] is unclear. In Mongolian, Delkhey (Delkhi) literally means earth. In modern Mongolian songs, the term Altan Delkhi is commonly mentioned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="820">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Argyra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑːr|dʒ|ᵻ|r|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀργυρᾶ) was one of the [[Naiad]]s, a [[nymph]] who resided in a well. There was a city in ancient [[Achaea]], also named [[Argyra, Greece|Argyra]], that was the site of a spring. According to legend, the nymph Argyra was in love with a shepherd named [[Selemnus]] whom she visited frequently. But when he aged and his youthful beauty vanished, she forsook him. When the boy died of grief, the goddess [[Aphrodite]] out of pity changed him into a river. There was a popular belief in Achaia that a forsaken lover who bathes in this river will forget their pain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] ''Description of Greece'' 7.23&lt;/ref&gt;

==`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan==
[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention [[Latin America]]n regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"His Holiness [[Christ]] says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the [[Kingdom of God]]. ... the republic of Mexico...to be familiar with the [[Spanish language]]...[[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador|Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Panama]] and the seventh country [[Belize]]...Attach great importance to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population of America...Likewise the islands of ...[[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Jamaica]], ... [[Bahama]] Islands, even the small [[Watling Island]]...[[Haiti]] and [[Santo Domingo]]...the islands of [[Bermuda]]... the republics of the continent of South America—[[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], [[The Guianas]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Paraguay]], [[Venezuela]]; also the islands to the north, east and west of South America, such as [[Falkland Islands]], the [[Galápagos Islands|Galapagòs]], [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernandez]], [[Trinidad and Tobago|Tobago and Trinidad]]...."&lt;ref name="Tabs"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the release of these tablets and then `Abdu'l-Bahá's death in 1921, a few Bahá'ís began moving to or at least visiting Latin America. In 1927 [[Leonora Armstrong]] was the first Bahá'í to visit and give lectures about the religion in Colombia as part of her plan to compliment and complete [[Martha Root]]'s unfulfilled intention of visiting all the Latin American countries for the purpose of presenting the religion to an audience.&lt;ref name="memorium"/&gt; Aura Sanchez of Bogotá is credited as the first Colombian Bahá'í. She joined the religion in 1929 after hearing of the religion from an American who was in that country.&lt;ref name="BN577"/&gt;

==Early phase==
[[Shoghi Effendi]], who was named `Abdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bahá'í administration#National|Bahá'í Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;  In his cable he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |origyear =  |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America  |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc =  5806374 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal | page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the May 1st cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the United States and Canada was appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;  In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan''  (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]] began to form in 1938 across Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;

The permanent Colombian Bahá'í community dates from the arrival of Gerard Sluter in 1940.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-America Addresses|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1940 | number = 139 | page =5 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=02&amp;page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next pioneer to arrive was Ruth Shoock who arrived in November–December 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-America News|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1942 | number = 158 | page =2 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=02&amp;page=527}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed closely by Winifred Louise Baker in later January 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-America News|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1942 | number = 158 | page =2 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=02&amp;page=527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Nieto is credited with being the first convert - he was from Barranquilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = South America|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1944 | number = 169 | page =7 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=02&amp;page=624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1967 into 1968 Vicente Montezuma, a Panamanian [[Guaymí]] who had previously served in the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Panama, pioneered to the rural areas of Colombia and promulgated the religion especially among the [[Choco languages|Choco speaking]] Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Guaymi Teacher Wins Choco Indians of Colombia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1968 | number = 446 |pages=8–9| url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=07&amp;page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost overlapping his trip [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Ruhiyyih Khanum]] traveled through Venezuela and Colombia from February 1968.&lt;ref name="BN449"&gt;{{cite magazine| title = 'Amatu'l Baha Ruhfyyih Khanum Visits Venezuela and Colombia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1968 | number = 449 |pages=4–7, 10| url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=07&amp;page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of February 29 she arrived at the Villa Rahmat, the Guajiro Indian Institute. The next evening she showed slides of her trips to Panama, Bolivia, and Argentina Indian to about thirty Riohacha adult and children Bahá'ís. Soon she traveled with local Bahá'ís to the sea salt harvest sands at [[Manaure, La Guajira|Manaure]]. From there the group went to the homeland of the [[Yukpa]](Yuko) in the [[Cesar Department]] where she camped in a [[Plantain (cooking)|Plaintain]] grove. There she promulgated the religion indirectly, by being known as a Bahá'í who was interested in their craft work even among avowed Bahá'ís. From there she and her group ascended into a more remote region and a machete wounded foot of a Bahá'í was tended. Later she offered that though she was raised largely in "city life" she had served an example of travel in the remote regions.&lt;ref name="BN449"/&gt; From there she visited the Bahá'ís in Barranquilla and Bogotá where she also gave talks.

While in the area she met [[Leonora Armstrong]].&lt;ref name="BN449"/&gt; Meanwhile, in May one of the first Bahá'ís in San Andrés insisted on a Bahá'í funeral which in turn was covered by local radio and attended by some 500 people including civic and religious leaders and resulted in a large venue for the observance of the Bahá'í Holy Day, the [[Bahá'í calendar#Holy days|Declaration of the Báb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Passing of Baha'is Proclaims Faith|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1968 | number = 450 | page =18| url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=07&amp;page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for a ''Trail of Light'' occurred during preparations for the first Bahá'í Native Council (see [[Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans]]) in 1978. Another inspiration for the Trail of Light was the concept of promulgating the religion among the indigenous peoples in the [[Pacific Rim]] that was described by the [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Rahmátu'llah Muhájir]] in 1978. The Trail of Light, also known as ''Camino del Sol'', was defined as a process whereby native Bahá'ís engaged with diverse native peoples about a number of issues including promulgating their religion as well as organizing councils for the people and encouraged discovery of mutual cultural links across the native peoples. The first ''Trail of Light'' traveling trip by 22 members of the religion occurred spontaneously immediately after the council.&lt;ref name="BN594 Council"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = 'Trail of Light' Native American teaching effort follows North American Baha'i Native Council |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1980 | number = 594|ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=6–7 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=10&amp;page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Alaska - A Baha'i community grows, matures |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1981 | number = 607 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=1–6 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=10&amp;page=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 the Trail of Light project began its work in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = 'Train of Light' completes successful visit|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1985 | number = 656 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=1–3 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=11&amp;page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the participants were two youth from the Guaymi tribe in Panama; six members from the Guajiros, the Colombo-Venezuelan tribe, and two youth from the Paez, a tribe in southern Colombia. They first traveled to the Guajira region and re-affirmed the religion among the Bahá'ís there and the group performed dances which inspired the Guajiros to offer their own dance, the Chichamaya, which had been illegal. The group was invited to the local high school where the Guaymis shared the story of the impact of the religion among their people (see [[Bahá'í Faith in Panama]].) The group was then invited to the elementary school. From Guajira the group headed to [[Valledupar]] and then on to the homeland of the [[Arhuaco]] tribe in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]]. There the group met with the leadership, the Mamos, or elders of the community for permission to present the message they had come to give. Various of the group presented to the Mamos including the Guaymi and their interpretation of their own prophecies. An elder shared that the Arhuaco had a similar prophecy. The Trail of Light group was allowed to make their presentations and exchanges of dances and talks followed. From there the group traveled to see the [[Yukpa]](Yuko) tribe. With the Yuko the group was able to hold a unity feast and shared dances and stayed for three days before heading home.

Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web| last = Momen  | first = Moojan  | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran  | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith"  | publisher = Bahai-library.com  | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon  | first = Geeta Gandhi | title  = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | url =http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory"/&gt; Since the 1970s the Colombian Bahá'ís have developed a pair of important institutions - FUNDAEC, and the Ruhi Institute.

===FUNDAEC===
{{main|FUNDAEC}}
Against a backdrop of serious social disruption and violence across Colombia Bahá'ís turned to service to the people living in the countryside. In 1974 [[FUNDAEC]]&lt;ref&gt;FUNDAEC is different from [[FUNDESCU]] though there are many similarities. FUNDAEC is the Colombian NGO based on Bahá'í consultations with Colombians starting in the 1970s and developed a number of projects like a secondary curriculum centered on skill development for living in the countryside and minimized [[urbanization]] for example. FUNDESCU is an older (from the 1950s) NGO in Panama based on Bahá'í consultations with Panamanian Indians and developed a system of schools serving largely remote areas. An agricultural project was attempted in the 1990s and was in fact based on cooperation between the Panamanian and Colombian NGOs but it failed from differences.{{Citation|last=Rhodenbaugh |first=Molly Marie |title=The Ngöbe Baha'is of Panama |work=MA Thesis in Anthropology |publisher=[[Texas Tech University]] |date=August 1999 |url=http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272008-31295016514407/unrestricted/31295016514407.pdf |pages=119–123 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815213017/http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272008-31295016514407/unrestricted/31295016514407.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by group of professors at the [[University of Valle]].&lt;ref name="Club"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Baha'i-inspired educational system for the poor of the world honored by the Club of Budapest  | newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service  | location = Frankfurt, Germany   | publisher =  Bahá’í International Community  | date = 22 December 2002  | url =  http://news.bahai.org/story/185  | accessdate = 2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gustav Correa, director of FUNDAEC, it was originally inspired by a quotation from [[Bahá'u'lláh]]  -  "Baha'u'llah talks about man as 'a mine rich in gems of inestimable value.'

===Ruhi Institute===
{{main|Ruhi Institute}}
In Colombia the [[Ruhi Institute]], a [[Bahá'í study circle]], began as an initiative of the community with a commitment starting in 1970.&lt;ref name="1970s"/&gt;  In 1980 a Ruhi Institute was operating in the border area where Ecuador and Colombia meet.&lt;ref name="BN594"/&gt; About 1980 one of the Auxiliary Board members in Colombia entered into a process of consultation with several rural communities around the town of Puerto Tejada in order to help them identify steps. they could take to improve their own social conditions.&lt;ref name="1980s"&gt;{{Harv|The Ruhi Institute|July 1991|pp=46–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early aim was to establish nurseries and kindergartens.

Especially in recent years, its educational programs have been adopted by an increasing number of agencies worldwide.&lt;ref name="organized"/&gt;

If individuals developed interests in contributing to society beyond those of the formal Ruhi courses they were introduced to the opportunities provided by FUNDAEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|The Ruhi Institute|July 1991|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent situation==

===Demographics===
In 2000 the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]] estimated some 64,000 Bahá'ís in Colombia ranking it as among the top 20 Bahá'í communities of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_bahai.html The Largest Baha'i Communities; Top 20 Largest National Baha'i Populations] Adherents.com&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated there were 70,512 Bahá'ís (0.2% of the population) in the country in 2005,&lt;ref name="WCE-05"/&gt;  and about the same in 2010.&lt;ref name=ARDA2010/&gt; [[Wolfram Alpha]] estimated 0.1531% of Colombians or almost 69,000 people were Bahá'ís in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Colombia: population, capital, cities, GDP, map, flag, currency, languages, ... | encyclopedia = Wolfram Alpha | volume = Online | publisher = Wolfram - Alpha (curated data) | date = March 13, 2010 | url = http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/countries/colombia/5g/th/so | accessdate = 2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Banisteriopsis caapi''''', also known as '''ayahuasca''', '''caapi''' or '''yagé''', is a [[South America]]n [[liana]] of the family [[Malpighiaceae]]. It is used to prepare [[ayahuasca]], a [[decoction]] with a long history of its [[entheogen]]ic use and its status as a "plant teacher" among the [[indigenous peoples]] of the [[Amazon rainforest]].

According to ''The CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names'' by Umberto Quattrocchi, the naming of the [[genus]] ''[[Banisteriopsis]]'' was dedicated to [[John Banister (naturalist)|John Banister]], a 17th-century English clergyman and naturalist. An earlier name for the genus was ''Banisteria'' and the plant is sometimes referred to as ''Banisteria caapi''. Other names include: Banisteria quitensis, Banisteriopsis inebrians and Banisteriopsis quitensis.&lt;ref name="Christian" /&gt;

==Botany==
Caapi is a giant vine with characteristic 12 to 14 millimetres, white or pale pink, flowers which most commonly appear in January, but are known to bloom infrequently. It resembles Banisteriopsis membranifolia and Banisteriopsis muricata, both to whom caapi is related.&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt;
[[File:3209-Banisteriopsis caapi-Teplice BZ.jpg|right|thumb|Caapi flowering]]
This tropical vine can grow up to 30 meters in length, twining on other plants for support.&lt;ref&gt;http://tropical.theferns.info/viewtropical.php?id=Banisteriopsis+caapi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phytochemicals==
===Alkaloids===
Caapi contains the following [[harmala alkaloid]]s:

*[[Harmine]], 0.31–8.43%&lt;ref name="Callaway2005" /&gt;
*[[Harmaline]], 0.03–0.83%&lt;ref name="Callaway2005" /&gt;
*[[Tetrahydroharmine]], 0.05–2.94%&lt;ref name="Callaway2005" /&gt;

These alkaloids of the [[beta-Carboline|beta-carboline]] class act as [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOIs). The MAOIs allow the primary psychoactive compound, [[N,N-dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], which is introduced from the other common ingredient in ayahausca ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'', to be orally active.

The stems contain 0.11–0.83% beta-carbolines, with harmine and tetrahydroharmine as the major components.&lt;ref name="Callaway2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/02791072.2005.10399795 | last1 = Callaway | first1 = J.

Alkaloids are present in all parts of the plant.&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;{{cite book |last= Rätsch|first= Christian|date= 2005|title=The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants: Ethnopharmacology and Its Applications|url= |location= |publisher= Inner Traditions/Bear|page= |isbn=9780892819782|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polyphenols===
In addition to beta-carbolines, caapi is known to contain [[proanthocyanidins]], [[epicatechin]] and [[procyanidin B2]], which have [[antioxidant]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Composition, Standardization and Chemical Profiling of Banisteriopsis caapi, a Plant for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disorders Relevant to Parkinson’s Disease|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878139/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
A study from 2017, published in [[Scientific Reports]] journal, focused on the effects of caapi alkaloids harmine, harmaline and tetrahydroharmine, demonstrating an increase in adult [[neurogenesis]] [[in vitro]]. Moreover, the research concluded that, as the effects of caapi alkaloids stimulate [[neuroplasticity]], this may be one of the reasons for ayahuasca's anti-depressive effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/s41598-017-05407-9| pmid=28706205| pmc=5509699|title = The alkaloids of Banisteriopsis caapi, the plant source of the Amazonian hallucinogen Ayahuasca, stimulate adult neurogenesis in vitro| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=7| issue=1| pages=5309|year = 2017|last1 = Morales-García|first1 = Jose A.| last2=de la Fuente Revenga| first2=Mario| last3=Alonso-Gil| first3=Sandra| last4=Rodríguez-Franco| first4=María Isabel| last5=Feilding| first5=Amanda| last6=Perez-Castillo| first6=Ana| last7=Riba| first7=Jordi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, harmine has been found to stimulate proliferation of human [[Progenitor cell|neural progenitors]] in vitro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 5144684|year = 2016|last1 = Dakic|first1 = V.|title = Harmine stimulates proliferation of human neural progenitors|journal = PeerJ|volume = 4|pages = e2727|last2 = MacIel|first2 = R.

==History==
First mention of caapi comes from early Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries who visited South America in the 16th century, describing ayahuasca brews as “diabolic” and dangerous decoctions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ayahuasca.com/amazon/when-and-how-was-ayahuasca-discovered-by-the-world-outside-the-amazon/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although utilised among the indigenous tribes of South America for hundreds and perhaps even thousands of years, caapi was not identified by westerners until 1851. when [[Richard Evans Schultes|Richard Spruce]], an English botanist, described it as a new species. He observed how [[Guahibo]]s,
the indigenous people of Llanos (Venezuela), chewed the bark of caapi instead of brewing it as a drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultes|first=Richard Evans|date= 1977|title=Hallucinogenic Plants|url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn=0-307-24362-1|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

===Legality===
In the United States, caapi is not specifically regulated. A 2006 Supreme Court decision involving caapi-containing ayahuasca, which also contains other plants containing the controlled substance [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], introduced from the ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' component, ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', was found in favor of the [[União do Vegetal]], a Brazilian religious sect using the tea in their ceremonies and having around 130 members in the United States.

In Australia, the harmala alkaloids are scheduled substances, including harmine and harmaline; however, the living vine, or other source plants are not scheduled in most states. In the State of Queensland as of March 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/2008/08AC004.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806135415/http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/2008/08AC004.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; this distinction is now uncertain.  In all states, the dried herb may or may not be considered a scheduled substance, dependent on court rulings.

In Canada, harmala is listed under the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] as a schedule III substance. The vine and the ayahuasca brew are legal ambiguities, since nowhere in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act is it stated that natural material containing a scheduled substance is illegal, a position supported by the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/images/archive/ayahuasca_law_undcp_fax1.jpg International control of the preparation "ayahuasca"], letter from the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board&lt;/ref&gt;

Caapi, as well as a range of harmala alkaloids, were recently{{when|date=August 2018}} scheduled in France, following a court victory by the [[Santo Daime]] religious sect allowing use of the tea due to it not being a chemical extraction and the fact that the plants used were not scheduled.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Religious exceptions to narcotics laws are not allowed under French law, effectively making any use or possession of the tea illegal.{{Contradict-inline|date=August 2016}}

===Patent issues===
The caapi vine itself was the subject of a dispute between U.S. entrepreneur Loren Miller and the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA). In 1986, Miller obtained a U.S. [[patent]] on a variety of ''B. caapi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|PP5751}}&lt;/ref&gt; COICA argued the patent was invalid because Miller's variety had been previously described in the [[University of Michigan Herbarium]], and was therefore neither new nor distinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Situation of the patent for Ayahuasca|date=7 July 2003|url=http://www.coica.org.ec/ingles/ma_documents/patent_ayahuasca.html|accessdate=10 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421224307/http://www.coica.org.ec/ingles/ma_documents/patent_ayahuasca.html|archive-date=21 April 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patent was overturned in 1999; however, in 2001, the [[United States Patent Office]] reinstated the patent because the law at the time the patent was granted did not allow a third party such as COICA standing to object. The Miller patent expired in 2003. ''B. caapi'' is now being cultivated commercially in Hawaii.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Cultural references==
The 2011 novel ''[[Plant Teacher]]'' explores how the use of caapi transforms the life of one narcotourist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Alethia, Caroline | title = Plant Teacher | publisher = Viator| location = United States | date = 2011 | isbn = 1468138391 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilfred Allen "Bill" Subritzky''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSM|size=85%}} (20 November 1925 – 23 December 2015) was a New Zealand lawyer and property developer, active from the mid-1950s until the mid-1980s. His company, Universal Homes, mass-produced houses in standard designs, and sold 14,000 houses over the 30-year period of Subritzky's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;" The Cutting Edge : The Bill Subritzky Story " p 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doveministries.com/content/prominent-lawyer-developer-and-evangelist-bill-subritzky-dies-age-90 "Prominent lawyer, developer and evangelist Bill Subritzky dies age 90"] (retrieved October 6, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subritzky was born in 1925, and lived in [[Auckland]]. In 1971 he became involved in the [[charismatic movement]], and became an independent evangelist and healer. Subritzky's [[faith healing]] ministry, Dove Ministries, distributes pamphlets, books and videos of his teaching and his evangelistic healing meetings. He was a charismatic [[Anglican]] but the style of his ministry was more similar to [[Pentecostal]]s such as the late [[Derek Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Shaw| first = Bob| coauthors = | title = Evangelist plans to make Good Word his last word| work = | pages = | publisher = The Evening Post| date = June 29, 1998| url = http://www.lexisnexis.com.remote.slc.edu/lnacui2api/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T12248011812&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T12248011815&amp;cisb=22_T12248011814&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=155910&amp;docNo=2| accessdate = June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subritzky was a proponent of the [[Toronto Blessing]] and its introduction into New Zealand. He frequently attributes problems, whether physical, spiritual, emotional or psychological, to the influence of [[demon]]s, which he claims to "cast out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Brown| first = Andrew| coauthors = | title = Evangelist can find a demon for every ill| work = | pages = | publisher = The Independent| date = September 15, 1990| url = http://www.lexisnexis.com.remote.slc.edu/lnacui2api/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T12248011812&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T12248011815&amp;cisb=22_T12248011814&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=8200&amp;docNo=3| accessdate = June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims to have insight through the "[[word of knowledge]]" into people's sins, which have made them vulnerable to demonic influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Brown| first = Andrew| coauthors = | title = Evangelist delivers demon warning| work = | pages = | publisher = The Independent| date = February 14, 1990| url = http://www.lexisnexis.com.remote.slc.edu/lnacui2api/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T12247918801&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T12247918804&amp;cisb=22_T12247918803&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=8200&amp;docNo=5
| accessdate = June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics have questioned his claim that he has ability to cure ailments such as asthma, arthritis and cancer; stating that he uses [[psychological manipulation]] to make people feel as though they are healed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =  | first =  | coauthors =  | title = Sceptics question faith healing | work =  | pages =  | publisher = [[Television New Zealand]] | date = 2006-10-24 | url = http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411419/868561 | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Crewdson| first = Patrick| coauthors =  | title = Exorcism exercise for fired-up faithful | work =  | pages =  3| publisher =  The Dominion Post | date = May 21, 2007| url = http://www.lexisnexis.com.remote.slc.edu/lnacui2api/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T12248011812&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T12248011815&amp;cisb=22_T12248011814&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=256380&amp;docNo=10| accessdate = June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subritzky was a friend to the controversial Nigerian "prophet" [[T.B. Joshua]] and publicly supported him amidst criticism that Joshua's "miracles" were not of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Egwugum| first = Jackson| coauthors = | title = T.B.

In 1986, Subritzky and other conservative Christians helped establish the [[Coalition of Concerned Citizens]], a right-wing Christian pressure group formed to oppose the socially-liberal policies of the [[Fourth Labour Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jesson|first1=Bruce |authorlink1= |first2=Allanah |last2=Ryan |first3=Paul |last3=Spoonley |title=Revival of the Right: New Zealand Politics in the 1980s |edition=1st |publisher=Heinemann Reed |year=1988 |pages=56 |chapter=Chapter 4: Remoralising Politics |isbn=0-7900-0003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was married to Lucy Patricia (Pat), who died in 2011. Subritzky later married Kaylene.

In the [[1991 New Year Honours]] Subritzky was awarded the [[Queen's Service Medal]] for community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52383 |date=31 December 1990 |page=31 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subritzky published his autobiography ''On the Cutting Edge: The Bill Subritzky Story'' in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Published by Sovereign World Ltd (Kent, UK) {{ISBN|1 85240 107 9}} PB ; {{ISBN|1 85240 131 1}} HB.&lt;/ref&gt; Subritzky died on 23 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilfred Allen (Bill) Subritzky |url=http://notices.nzherald.co.nz/obituaries/nzherald-nz/obituary.aspx?n=wilfred-allen-subritzky-bill&amp;pid=177021622 |accessdate=26 December 2015 | publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|Bless}}
In [[Religion|religion]], a '''blessing''' (also used to refer to bestowing of such) is the infusion of something with [[Sacred|holiness]], spiritual [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]], or [[Will of God|divine will]].

== Etymology and Germanic paganism ==
The modern English language term ''bless'' likely derives from the 1225 term ''blessen'', which developed from the [[Old English]] ''blǣdsian'' (preserved in the [[Northumbria]]n dialect around 950 AD).&lt;ref name=BARNHART73&gt;Barnhart (1995:73).&lt;/ref&gt; The term also appears in other forms, such as ''blēdsian'' (before 830), ''blētsian'' from around 725 and ''blesian'' from around 1000, all meaning to make sacred or holy by a sacrificial custom in the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon pagan]] period, originating in [[Germanic paganism]]; to mark with blood.&lt;ref name=BARNHART73/&gt; Due to this, the term is related to the term ''blōd'', meaning ''[[blood]]''.&lt;ref name=BARNHART73/&gt; References to this indigenous practice, [[Blót]], exist in related [[Iceland]]ic sources.

The modern meaning of the term may have been influenced in translations of the Bible into Old English during the process of [[Christianization]] to translate the [[Latin]] term ''benedīcere'' meaning to "speak well of", resulting in meanings such as to "praise" or "extol" or to speak  of or to wish well.&lt;ref name=BARNHART73/&gt;

==Abrahamic religions==
[[File:Isaak zegent Jakob Rijksmuseum SK-A-110.jpeg|thumb|''[[Isaac]] Blessing [[Jacob]]'', painting by [[Govert Flinck]] ([[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]])]]
{{Main|Abrahamic religions}}
'To be blessed' means to be favored by [[YHWH|God]], the source of all blessing.&lt;ref name="Chinuch"/&gt; Blessings, therefore, are directly associated with, and are believed to come from, God. Thus, to express a blessing is like bestowing a wish on someone that they experience the favor of God, and to acknowledge God as the source of all blessing.

A biblical damnation, in its most formal sense, is a negative blessing.

In the [[Bible]], positive and negative blessings are related; the book of [[Deuteronomy]] prescribes that obedience to the [[Ten Commandments|Law of Moses]] brings God's blessing. One of the first incidences of blessing in the Bible is in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|12:1-2|HE}} where [[Abram]] is ordered by the [[YHWH|God]] to leave his country and is told:

{{Blockquote|"I will bless you, I will make your name great."}}

The [[Priestly Blessing]] is set forth at [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|6:24-26|HE}}:

: May [[Names_of_God_in_Judaism#Adonai|Adonai]] bless you, and guard you;
: May Adonai make His countenance shine upon you, and be gracious to you;
: May Adonai turn His countenance to you and grant you peace.

===Judaism===
[[File:Synagoge, Enschede, Mozaiek.jpg|thumb|right|Position in which a Jewish [[kohen]] places his hands and fingers during the [[Priestly Blessing]], detail of a mozaic in the Synagoge of Enschede, Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;The mosaic text reads "בשמאלה עשר וכבוד" ("in her left hand riches and honor"), which is a part of Proverbs 3:16.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[Rabbinic Judaism]], a blessing (or ''[[berakhah]]'') is recited at a specified moment during a prayer, ceremony or other activity, especially before and after partaking of food. The function of blessings is to acknowledge [[God in Judaism|God]] as the source of all blessing.&lt;ref name="Chinuch"&gt;[[Sefer ha-Chinuch]] 430&lt;/ref&gt; A ''berakhah'' of rabbinic origin typically starts with the words, "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe..." Rabbinic Judaism teaches that food ultimately is a gift of the one great Provider, God, and that to partake of food legitimately one should express gratitude to God by reciting the appropriate blessing of rabbinic origin prior, while torah mandates an informal blessing afterwards.&lt;ref name="Chinuch"/&gt; [[Jewish law]] does not reserve recitation of blessings to only a specific class of Jews; but it does mandate specific blessings to specific occasions, so that, for example since medieval times, Jewish women chiefly recite a rabbinic blessing after lighting two [[Shabbat candles]].

===Christianity===
[[File:First communion blessing.jpg|thumb|[[First Communion]]]]
Blessings and [[curse]]s of [[Christ]] appear in the [[New Testament]], as recounted in the [[Beatitudes]] of Luke 6:20-22. Within [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Lutheranism]], and similar traditions, formal blessings of the church are performed by [[bishop]]s, [[priest]]s, and [[deacon]]s. Particular formulas may be associated with [[episcopal blessing]]s and [[papal blessing]]s. In Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran churches blessings are bestowed by [[bishop]]s and [[priest]]s in a [[liturgy|liturgical]] context, raising their right hand and making the [[Sign of the Cross#Use of the sign|sign of the cross]] with it over persons or objects to be blessed. They also give blessings to begin [[daily office|divine services]] and at the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] at the end.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] liturgical blessings are performed over people, objects, or are given at specific points during divine services. A priest or bishop usually blesses with his hand, but may use a [[blessing cross]], [[candle]]s, an [[icon]], the [[chalice (cup)|Chalice]] or [[Gospel Book]] to bestow blessings, always making the [[Sign of the Cross]] therewith. When blessing with the hand, a priest uses his right hand, holding his fingers so that they form the Greek letters [[IC XC]], the monogram of Jesus Christ. A bishop does the same, except he uses both hands, or may hold the [[crozier]] in his left hand, using both to make the Sign of the Cross. A bishop may also bless with special candlesticks known as the [[dikirion and trikirion]]. When blessing an object, the [[rubrics]] often instruct Orthodox bishops and priests to make use of such substances as [[incense]] and [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|holy water]]. Also, formal ecclesiastical permission to undertake an action is referred to as a "blessing". The blessing may be bestowed by a bishop or priest, or by one's own [[spiritual father]]. When an Orthodox [[laity|layperson]] bestows a blessing, he or she will hold the thumb and first two fingers of the right hand together (the same configuration used when making the Sign of the Cross on themselved), and make the sign of the cross over the person or object they are blessing.

In the [[Methodist]] tradition, the minister blesses the congregation during the concluding part of the service of worship, known as the [[benediction]]. With regard to [[house blessing]]s, the Methodist ''[[Book of Worship for Church and Home (1965)|The Book of Worship for Church and Home]]'' (1965) contains "An Office for the Blessing of a Dwelling".&lt;ref name="BOW1964"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Worship for Church and Home: With Orders of Worship, Services for the Administration of the Sacraments and Other Aids to Worship According to the Usages of the Methodist Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ckw6vgAACAAJ|accessdate=25 March 2017|year=1964|publisher=Methodist Publishing House|language=English |pages=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic Church a priest or bishop blesses]] the faithful with the [[Blessed Sacrament]] in the [[monstrance]] during [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]]. According to the guidelines given by the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments]] that govern the procedures for liturgical ceremonies, if a Roman Catholic layperson (a lay acolyte or parish administrator, for example) or any non-ordained religious (who is not the superior of the congregation) leads a Sunday service (other than a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], which requires a priest to celebrate), such as [[Eucharist]]ic adoration, the [[Rosary]], or celebration of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]], he or she does not perform rites or sacraments reserved to the clergy and does not solemnly bless the people as a bishop, priest, or deacon would at the end of the service; an alternative format is used instead.

In the [[Lutheran Church]]es, priests are often asked to bless objects frequently used by or sacred to individuals, such as a [[cross necklace]]; in addition, Lutheran clergy also bless the homes of members of the congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/03/01/what-is-house-blessing-and-should-have-one.html|title=What is a house blessing and should you have one?|last=Jackson|first=Katie|date=1 March 2017|publisher=[[Fox News]]|language=English|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], blessings are given by worthy, male members who hold the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=00:00 |url=https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings?lang=eng |title=20.

===Islam===
Blessings in Islam has twofold aspect, according to major scholars of Islam Blessings are given by [[Allah]] as a trial for mankind. Scholars of Islam believe that having fear of being gradually misled by blessings is an attribute of the pious and not having fear from such even though one is constantly misbehaving is an attribute of the impious. In Islam, blessings can be a source of success in afterlife if one is grateful to [[Allah]] for them and the same blessings can be a source for damnation in afterlife if one doesn't constantly be grateful to God for them.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaning of Blessings in Islam|url=https://seekingthedivinecountenance.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/dual-nature-of-blessings-in-islam/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Islam]] has no clerical caste, and therefore no blessings reserved to specific individuals. Muslims will frequently pronounce "peace and blessings be upon him" when mentioning the name of [[Muhammad]] or indeed, any of the prophets. Muslims will also greet one another with a blessing every time they meet and depart (السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته  as-salāmu alaikum wa rahmatul-lāhi wa barakātuh (meaning "[[As-salamu alaykum|may peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you]]")).&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt;

==Dharma religions==
[[Indian religions]], which includes [[Hinduism]] and its offshoots [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], etc. are also called [[Dharma]] religions, all of which are based on the concept of dharma and [[karma]] and typical blessings are based on [[Adhiṣṭhāna]], [[Añjali Mudrā]], [[Darśana]] and [[Mudra]], etc.

===Hinduism===

[[File:Aarti-night.jpg|right|thumb|[[Aarti]].]]
In [[Hinduism]] [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] is a religious ritual performed by Hindus as an offering to various deities, distinguished persons, or special guests. It is modeled on the idea of giving a gift or offering to a deity or important person and receiving their approval (''"Ashirvād"''). During the Puja involves an '[[Aarti]] plate' or 'Aarti lamp' is circulating around a deity or person and is generally accompanied by the singing of songs in praise of that deity or person (many versions exist). In doing so, the plate or lamp is supposed to acquire the power of the deity. The priest circulates the plate or lamp to all those present. They cup their down-turned hands over the flame and then raise their palms to their forehead - the purificatory blessing, passed from the deity's image to the flame, has now been passed to the devotee.

During the [[naivedya]] ritual, a devotee makes an offering of a material substance such as flowers, fruits, or sweets. The deity then 'enjoys' or tastes a bit of the offering, which is then temporarily known as [[bhogya]]. This now-divinely invested substance is called [[prasāda]], and is received by the devotee to be ingested, worn, etc. It may be the same material that was originally offered, or material offered by others and then re-distributed to other devotees. In many temples, several kinds of prasada (e.g. nuts, sweets) are distributed to the devotees.

[[File:Hindu-priest-blessing.jpg|thumb|left|Hindu priest giving blessing.]]
[[Darśana|Darshan]] is a term meaning "sight" (in the sense of an instance of seeing or beholding; from a root ''dṛś'' "to see"), [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]], apparition, or glimpse. It is most commonly used for "visions of the divine," e.g., of a god or a very holy person or artifact. One could "receive darshana" of the deity in the temple, or from a great saintly person, such as a great [[guru]]. The touching of the feet (''pranāma'') is a show of respect and it is often an integral part of darshan. Children touch the feet of their family elders while people of all ages will bend to touch the feet of a great guru, [[murti]] (icon) of a [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]] (God) (such as [[Rama]] or [[Krishna]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siddhayoga.org.in/glossary.html Glossary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721180724/http://www.siddhayoga.org.in/glossary.html |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a special link between worshipper and guru during [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s, in which people may touch the guru's feet in respect ([[Pranāma]]), or remove the dust from a guru's feet before touching their own head.

Another tradition is "Vāhan pujā" (Hindi) or "Vāgana poojai" (Tamil வாகன பூஜை) 'vehicle blessing'. This is a ritual that is performed when one purchases a new vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

A ''blessing'' can also be a request for permission, as in "gaining your [[parent]]s' blessing" would consist of having been granted consent. Clergy will normally receive a blessing from their ecclesiastical superiors to begin their ministry. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] pious laymen would go to a [[starets]] ([[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]) to receive his or her blessing before embarking upon any important work or making a major decision in their life. In [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], a member may receive a special blessing, known as a [[patriarchal blessing]], as guidance.  In the U.S., there are sometimes ritual ceremonies to bless companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ritual blessings with companion animals|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296307002081|journal = Journal of Business Research|date = 2008-05-01|pages = 534–541|volume = 61|series = Animal Companions, Consumption Experiences, and the Marketing of Pets: Transcending Boundaries in the Animal-Human Distinction|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.07.026|first = Susan L.|last = Holak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], there is a blessing which can be used as a tender [[wiktionary:farewell|farewell]], especially from a parent: ''Vaya con Dios'' ("Go with God"), also [[wikt:adiós|Adiós]] (''A Dios'', "to God"), similar to the [[French language|French]] ''Adieu''.

'''Blessing''' is also a term used for marriage in the [[Unification Church]], ''see:'' [[Blessing Ceremony of the Unification Church]].

In [[Hawaii]] anything new (a new building, a new stretch of road to be opened, a new garden) receives a blessing by a
Hawaiian practitioner (or [[Kahuna]]) in a public ceremony (involving also the unwinding of e.g. a [[maile]] [[lei (Hawaii)|lei]]).{{cn|date= December 2017}}

In the [[Kyrgyz people]]'s tradition, the blessing (''bata'' or ''ak bata'', "the right blessing" or "white blessing") might be a good wish to somebody by the elderly person or the person with a best reputation before the travel or launch of some activity of the person who seeks such a blessing and moral support. The prosedure might be a trace of the pre-Islamic local nomadic traditions with deep family values.  Some times, elderly person(s) might give a negative blessing (so called "teskeri bata" - "the opposite blessing" or "the black blessing"). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.azattyk.org/a/kyrgyz_term_study_forum_soz_taanuu_sherinesi/2303052.html&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;br&gt;

'''Chief Rabbi''' is a title given in several countries to the recognised religious leader of that country's [[Jews|Jewish community]], or to a rabbinic leader appointed by the local secular authorities.  Since 1911, through a capitulation by [[Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel]], Israel has had two chief rabbis, one [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and one [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cameron Brown |url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2000/issue4/jv4n4a3.html |title=Rabbi Ovadia Yosef And His Culture War in Israel |publisher=Meria.idc.ac.il |date= |accessdate=9 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029213241/http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2000/issue4/jv4n4a3.html |archivedate=29 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities with large Jewish communities may also have their own chief rabbis; this is especially the case in Israel but has also been past practice in major Jewish centers in Europe prior to [[the Holocaust]]. North American cities rarely have chief rabbis. One exception however is [[Montreal]], with two—one for the Ashkenazi community, the other for the Sephardi.

Jewish law provides no support for the post of a "chief rabbi" since every rabbi has equal authority in principle.  The position arose in Europe in the Middle Ages from governing authorities largely for secular administrative reasons such as collecting taxes and registering vital statistics, and for providing an intermediary between the government and the Jewish community, for example in the establishment of the [[Crown rabbi (Iberia)|Crown rabbi]] in several kingdoms of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the ''rab de la corte'' in [[Kingdom of Castile]] or the ''arrabi mor'' in [[Kingdom of Portugal]], likely influenced by the expectations of their Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican governments and neighbors.&lt;ref name="Berlin-2011"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion |editor-last1=Berlin |editor-first1=Adele |editor-link=Adele Berlin |last=Himelstein |first=Shmuel |title=Chief Rabbinate |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&amp;pg=PA195 |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |volume= |isbn=978-0-19-973004-9 |pages=166 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the 19th century there was a ''[[Crown rabbi (Russia)|Crown rabbi]]'' of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe |editor-last1=Kaplan Appel |editor-first1=Tamar |editor-link1= |title=Crown Rabbi |last1= |first1= |author-link1= |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |edition= |series= |volume= |isbn=9780300119039 |oclc=170203576 |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327120806/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |archivedate=2015-03-27 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spanish and Portuguese Hahamim/Communal rabbis (not Sephardi Chief Rabbi)====
The Sephardi Anglo-Jewry in the United Kingdom is mainly made up of independent Sephardi communities and synagogues, with no unified body. Thus, there is no Sephardi Chief Rabbi. The Senior Rabbi of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]]' Congregation oversees the rabbis of the several synagogues which are affiliated with the congregation. The honorific title ''[[Hakham|haham]]'' (plural ''hahamim''), meaning wise, was given to each Senior Rabbi until Solomon Gaon. When Solomon Gaon retired, the congregation dropped such title and decided to separate the function of communal rabbi from the function of Dayan.

===Israel===
{{main|Chief Rabbinate of Israel}}
The position of chief rabbi of the [[Land of Israel]] has existed for hundreds of years. During the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandatory Period]], the British recognized the chief rabbis of the Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities, just as they recognized the [[Mufti of Jerusalem]]. The offices continued after statehood was achieved. [[Haredi]] Jewish groups (such as [[Edah HaChareidis]]) do not recognize the authority of the Chief Rabbinate. They usually have their own rabbis who do not have any connection to the state rabbinate.

Under current Israeli law, the post of Chief Rabbi exists in only four cities ([[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]], and [[Beersheba]]). In other cities there may be one main rabbi to whom the other rabbis of that city defer, but that post is not officially the "Chief Rabbi".

Many of Israel's chief rabbis were previously chief rabbis of Israeli cities.

===United States===
A chief rabbinate never truly developed within the United States for a number of different reasons. While Jews first settled in the United States in 1654 in [[New York City]], rabbis did not appear in the United States until the mid-nineteenth century. This lack of rabbis, coupled with the lack of official colonial or state recognition of a particular sect of Judaism as official effectively led to a form of [[Congregationalist polity|congregationalism]] amongst American Jews. This did not stop others from trying to create a unified American Judaism, and in fact, some chief rabbis developed in some American cities despite lacking universal recognition amongst the Jewish communities within the cities (for examples see below). However, [[Jonathan Sarna]] argues that those two precedents, as well as the desire of many Jewish immigrants to the US to break from an Orthodox past, effectively prevented any effective Chief Rabbi in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Judaism: A History|last=Sarna|first= Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Sarna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ujw_IawuIIgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=chief%20rabbi&amp;f=false|volume=|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-10976-8|page=105|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22926">The '''Persecution of paganism under [[Theodosius I]]''' began in 381, after the first couple of years of his reign as  [[Augustus (honorific)#Division of Empire|co-emperor]] in the eastern part of the Roman Empire. In the 380s, [[Theodosius I]] reiterated Constantine's ban on [[pagan]] sacrifice, prohibited [[haruspicy]] [[death penalty|on pain of death]], pioneered the criminalization of magistrates who did not enforce anti-pagan laws, broke up some pagan associations and destroyed pagan temples.

Between 389 and 391 he issued the "Theodosian decrees," which established a practical ban on paganism;&lt;ref name="TheodosianCode16.10.11"/&gt; visits to the temples were forbidden,&lt;ref name="Routery1997ch4"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "TheodosianCode16.10.10" /&gt; remaining pagan [[holidays]] abolished, the [[Sacred fire of Vesta|sacred fire]] in the Temple of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] in the [[Roman Forum]] extinguished, the [[Vestal Virgins]] disbanded, [[auspices]] and [[witchcraft]] punished. Theodosius refused to restore the [[Altar of Victory]] in the Senate House, as requested by pagan [[Roman Senate|Senators]].

In 392 he became emperor of the whole empire (the last one to be so). From this moment until the end of his reign in 395, while pagans remained outspoken in their demands for toleration,&lt;ref name="Zosimus4.59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SymmachusRelatio3" /&gt; he authorized or participated in the destruction of many temples, holy sites, images and objects of piety throughout the empire&lt;ref name="Grindle1892pp29-30" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "LifeStMartin" /&gt;{{Sfn | Gibbon | 1776–89 | loc = ch. 28}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}}{{Sfn | MacMullen | 1984}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}}&lt;ref name="CathEnc1912Theophilus"/&gt; in actions by Christians against major pagan sites.{{Sfn | MacMullen | 1984 | p = 90}}  He issued a comprehensive law that prohibited any public pagan ritual,&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt; and was particularly oppressive of [[Manicheans]].&lt;ref name = "FirstChristianTheologiansp68" /&gt; He is likely to have suppressed the [[Ancient Olympic Games]], whose last record of celebration is 393.&lt;ref name="KotynskiP3" /&gt;

==Initial tolerance (379–381)==
[[Theodosius I]], who reigned only in the east as co-emperor until 392, had been relatively tolerant towards pagans in the early part of his reign.&lt;ref name = "Th12.1.112"&gt;Theodosian Code 12.1.112.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" |Theodosius dealt harshly with Arians, heretics and Christian apostates. Early in his reign Theodosius was fairly tolerant of the pagans since he needed the support of the influential pagan ruling class and the percentage of non-Christians was still quite large, perhaps 50% overall, especially in the West where the Church was still largely an urban phenomenon except in North Africa. He voiced his support for the preservation of temples or pagan statues as useful public buildings. He is known to have appointed various pagans to office in the earlier part of his reign. For example, he appointed the pagan [[Eutolmius Tatianus]] as the praetorian prefect of Egypt.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Zosimus|p=4.45"&gt;{{harvnb|Zosimus|p=4.45}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first part of his rule, Theodosius seems to have ignored the semi-official standing of the Christian bishops. However, he issued a number of harsh laws directed at [[apostates]] which indicates some Christians were converting to paganism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Theodosian Code 16.7.1, 1.7.2, 16.7.2, 16.7.3, 16.7.4, 16.7.5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" |Theodosius also legislated against private divination.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.7, 16.10.9, 9.16.11, 9.38.7, 9.38.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sirm8"&gt;Constitutiones Sirmondianae 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, he tried to stamp out the last vestiges of paganism with great severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14577d.htm | contribution = Theodosius I | title = Catholic Encyclopedia | year = 1912 | publisher = New Advent}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However he did not succees in this. Even though deprived of State and municipal support, bereft of funds and property the followers of the old religions continued to survive visibly, though under pressure and weakening, into the early 6th century. Justinian waged a campaign against pagans in Asia Minor and it is said 80,000 were forcibly converted. During the 6th century the virulent Christian attacks lessened as the old gods became the subject of fables. 

Theodosius I's relative tolerance for other religions is also indicated by his later order (in 388) for the reconstruction of a Jewish synagogue at [[Raqqa|Callinicum]] in Mesopotamia.{{Refn | name = "Ambr" | group = "lower-alpha"}}

==Persecution==
===First attempts to inhibit paganism (381–388)===
His first attempt to inhibit paganism was in 381 when he reiterated Constantine's ban on sacrifice. In 384 he prohibited [[haruspicy]] [[death penalty|on pain of death]], and unlike earlier anti-pagan prohibitions, he made non-enforcement of the law by magistrates a crime.

Both Theodosius and [[Valentinian II]] formally recognized [[Magnus Maximus|Maximus]] in the year 384. For a time, the pagans enjoyed religious liberty once again and many distinguished pagans rose to important offices in the state.{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" |For example, in the year 384 [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] was Urban Prefect and [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]] held the post of [[Praefectus Praetorio Italiae Illyrici et Africae Iterum]]. These men were distinguished pagans.}}  The fact that the temples continued to be cared for and that pagan festivals continued to be celebrated is indicated by a law of 386, which declared that care for the temples and festivals were the exclusive prerogative of the pagans.&lt;ref name = "Th12.1.112" /&gt;  This law also confirms the right of the priests to perform the traditional pagan rites of the temples. In the year 387, Theodosius declared war on Maximus after Maximus had driven Valentinian II out of Italy. Maximus was defeated and executed and the anti-pagan regulations of Gratian were apparently reinstated by Valentinian II.

In 388 he sent a prefect to Syria, Egypt, and Asia Minor with the aim of breaking up pagan associations and the destruction of their temples. The [[Serapeum#Alexandria|Serapeum]] at Alexandria was destroyed during this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Socr., V, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theodosian decrees (389–391)===
In a series of decrees called the "Theodosian decrees" he progressively declared that those pagan [[festival|feast]]s that had not yet been rendered Christian ones were now to be workdays (in 389).

In 391, he reiterated the ban of [[Animal sacrifice|blood sacrifice]] and decreed "no one is to go to the sanctuaries, walk through the temples, or raise his eyes to statues created by the labor of man"&lt;ref name="Routery1997ch4"&gt;{{Citation |last=Routery |first=Michael |year=1997 |url=http://www.vinland.org/scamp/grove/kreich/chapter4.html |title=The First Missionary War.

Also in the year 391, [[Valentinian II]] which was emperor in the West under the aegis of Theodosius, under the advice of [[Ambrose]] issued a law that not only prohibited sacrifices but also forbade anyone from visiting the temples.&lt;ref name="TheodosianCode16.10.10"&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.10&lt;/ref&gt; This again caused turbulence in the West. Valentinian II quickly followed this law with a second one, which declared that pagan temples were to be closed, a law that was viewed as practically outlawing paganism.&lt;ref name = "TheodosianCode16.10.11"&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The emperor Theodosius, who had been reigning in the East, had been relatively tolerant towards pagans in the early part of his reign.&lt;ref name = "Th12.1.112" /&gt;  Theodosius dealt harshly with Arians, heretics and Christian apostates. Laws were directed against Christians who sought to convert back to the old religions&lt;ref name= "hughes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Theodosian Code 16.7.1, 1.7.2, 16.7.2, 16.7.3, 16.7.4, 16.7.5.&lt;/ref&gt; and against private divination.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.7, 16.10.9, 9.16.11, 9.38.7, 9.38.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sirm8" /&gt;  He is known to have appointed various pagans to office in the earlier part of his reign. For example, he appointed the pagan [[Tatianus]] as the praetorian prefect of Egypt.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Zosimus|p=4.45"/&gt;  His tolerance for other religions is indicated by his 388 order for the reconstruction of a Jewish synagogue at [[Raqqa|Callinicum]] in Mesopotamia, which had been destroyed by a bishop and his Christian flock.{{Refn | name = "Ambr" | group = "lower-alpha" |[[Ambrose]] was opposed to this reconstruction and paints a picture of all the dire consequences that he felt would result from this edict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ambrose | title = Epistles | at = 40, 41.27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the death of Maximus, Valentinian II, under the aegis of Theodosius, once again assumed the office of emperor in the West. Valentinian II, advised by Ambrose, and in spite of pleas from the pagans, refused to restore the Altar of Victory to the Senate House, or their income to the priests and Vestal Virgins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ambrose | title = Epistles | at = 17, 18, 57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentinian was murdered, possibly by agents of [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]] whom he had tried to dismiss, and [[Eugenius]], a professor of rhetoric, was proclaimed emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Valentian II | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition = Ultimate DVD | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancestral religious rites were once again performed openly and the Altar of Victory was restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = St. Ambrose | last = of Milan | title = Letters | year = 1881 | pages = 324–54 | volume = Letters 51–60 | chapter = Letter 57: To the emperor Eugenius | accessdate = 5 May 2007 | url = http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_06_letters51_60.htm | publisher = Tertullian}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|right|''Saint Ambrose and Emperor Theodosius'', [[Anthony van Dyck]].]]
The temples that were thus closed could be declared "abandoned", as Bishop [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus of Alexandria]] immediately noted in applying for permission to demolish a site and cover it with a Christian church, an act that must have received general sanction, for ''[[Mithraism|mithraea]]'' forming crypts of churches, and temples forming the foundations of 5th century churches appear throughout the former Roman Empire.

By decree in 391, Theodosius ended the subsidies that had still trickled to some remnants of Greco-Roman civic paganism too. In 394 the [[Sacred fire of Vesta|eternal fire]] in the Temple of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] in the [[Roman Forum]] was extinguished, and the [[Vestal Virgins]] were disbanded. Taking the [[auspices]] and practicing [[witchcraft]] were to be punished. When pagan members of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] in Rome appealed to him to restore the [[Altar of Victory]] in the Senate House, he refused.

The apparent change of policy that resulted in the "Theodosian decrees" has often been credited to the increased influence of [[Ambrose]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|bishop of Milan]]. In 390 Ambrose had excommunicated Theodosius, thereafter he had greater influence with a penitent Theodosius.{{Sfn | MacMullen | 1984}}

Only after what is commonly known as the "massacre" of [[Thessalonica]] (in 390) was Ambrose able to gain influence with Theodosius. Ambrose accomplished this by [[Excommunication#Roman Catholic Church|excommunicating]] Theodosius and thereby forcing him to obey him.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Ambrose had a council of the Church condemn this act. Theodosius submitted himself to Ambrose and agreed to do [[penance]]. Theodosius' penance apparently included his promise to adopt a new role as the champion of the Christian faith.{{citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The excommunication was due to Theodosius orders which resulted in the [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|massacre]] of 7,000 inhabitants of [[Thessalonica]],&lt;ref name="Nor"&gt;{{Citation | first = J | last = Norwich | title = Byzantium: The Early Centuries | page = 112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the assassination of his military governor stationed in the city, and that Theodosius performed several months of public penance.

Some modern historians question the consequences of the laws against pagans.&lt;ref&gt;R. Malcolm Errington, "Christian Accounts of the Religious Legislation of Theodosius I" (1997) 79:2 ''Klio'' 398.&lt;/ref&gt; The specifics of the decrees were superficially limited in scope, specific measures in response to various petitions from Christians throughout his administration{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. The punishment for venerating man-made pagan images was the forfeiture of an individual's house. An individual's punishment for sacrificing in temples or shrines was a fine of twenty-five pounds of gold&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Medieval Europe: A Short Sourcebook | last1 = Hollister | last2 = Leedom | last3 = Meyer | last4 = Spear | pages = 11–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 391 in Alexandria in the wake of the great anti-pagan riots "busts of Serapis which stood in the walls, vestibules, doorways and windows of every house were all torn out and annihilated..., and in their place the sign of the Lord's cross was painted in the doorways, vestibules, windows and walls, and on pillars."&lt;ref name="ramsey"&gt;{{Citation | first = R | last = MacMullen | title = Christianizing The Roman Empire A.D. 100–400 | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1984 | ISBN = 0-300-03642-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War on paganism by Theodosius (392–395)===
Rome was more pagan than Christian up until the 390s; [[Gaul]], [[Spain]] and northern [[Italy]], in all but the urban areas, were pagan, save Milan which remained half pagan.{{Sfn | MacMullen | 1984}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}}

In the year 392, Theodosius become Emperor of also the western part of the Roman Empire, the last emperor to rule over both. In the same year he officially began to [[proscribe]] the practice of paganism. This was when he authorized the destruction of many temples throughout the empire.&lt;ref name="Grindle1892pp29-30"&gt;Grindle, Gilbert (1892) ''The Destruction of paganism in the Roman Empire'', pp. 29–30: 'For example, Theodosius ordered Cynegius (Zosimus 4.37), the praetorian prefect of the East, to permanently close down the temples and forbade the worship of the deities throughout Egypt and the East. Most of the destruction was perpetrated by Christian monks and bishops...'&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian actions against major pagan sites====
Theodosius participated in actions by Christians against major pagan sites: the destruction of the gigantic [[Serapeum]] by soldiers in 391, according to the Christian sources authorized by Theodosius (''extirpium malum'') needs to be seen against a complicated background of less spectacular violence in the city: [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] mentions street-fighting in Alexandria between Christians and non-Christians as early as 249, and non-Christians had participated in the struggles for and against [[Athanasius]] in 341 and 356.  "In 363 they killed Bishop George for repeated acts of pointed outrage, insult, and pillage of the most sacred treasures of the city."{{Sfn | MacMullen | 1984 | p = 90}} In 391 riots broke out between supporters of Theodosius's Imperial Prefect and the supporters of the independent Patriarch of Alexandria as to who really governed in Alexandria; the rioters opposing the Patriarch took refuge in the Serapeum and used it as a fortress; when order was restored the prefect ordered it demolished so future rioters could not use it for the same purpose.

====Suppression of pagan rituals, religio illicita====
Theodosius issued a comprehensive law that prohibited the performance of any type of pagan sacrifice or worship.&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;{{Citation | title = A History of the Church | first = Philip | last = Hughes | publisher = Sheed &amp; Ward | edition = rev | year = 1949 | volume = I | chapter = 6 | url = http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/HUGHHIST.TXT}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.12&lt;/ref&gt; Theodosius prohibited imperial palace officers and magistrates from honoring their [[Lares]] with fire, their Genius with wine, or their [[Penates]] with [[incense]]. Theodosius also prohibited the practice of all forms of divination, even those forms of divination that were not considered harmful to the welfare of the Emperor, with this wide-ranging law. The laws were particularly hard against the [[Manicheans]] who were deprived of the right to make wills or to benefit from them. Manicheans could be sought out by informers, brought to court and in some cases executed.&lt;ref name="FirstChristianTheologiansp68"&gt;{{Citation | title = The First Christian Theologians: An Introduction to Theology in the Early Church | editor-first = Gillian Rosemary | editor-last = Evans | first = Clarence | last = Gallagher SJ | contribution = The Imperial Ecclesiastical Lawgivers | page = 68 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | year = 2004 | ISBN = 0-631-23187-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Paganism was now proscribed, a "religio illicita".{{Sfn | Hughes | 1957}}

====Suppression from 393 till 395====
In 393, Theodosius was ready to begin his war against [[Eugenius]] and [[Arbogastes]]. The battle that ensued became, in essence, a battle for the survival of paganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zosimus|pp=4.53–4.55, 4.58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defeat of Eugenius by Theodosius in 394 led to the final separation of paganism from the state. Theodosius visited Rome to attempt to convert the pagan members of the Senate.  Being unsuccessful in this, he withdrew all state funds that had been set aside for the public performance of pagan rites.&lt;ref name="Zosimus4.59"&gt;{{harvnb|Zosimus|p=4.59}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point forward, state funds would never again be made available for the public performance of pagan rites nor for the maintenance of the pagan temples. Despite this setback on their religion, the pagans remained outspoken in their demands for toleration.&lt;ref name="SymmachusRelatio3"&gt;Symmachus Relatio 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many pagans simply pretended to convert as an obvious instrument of advancement.

{{quote |Theodosius was not the man to sympathise with the balancing policy of the [[Edict of Milan]].  He set himself steadfastly to the work of establishing Catholicism and (Nicean Eastern Orthodox Christianity) as the privileged religion of the state, of repressing dissident Christians (heretics) and of enacting explicit legal measures to abolish paganism in all its phases.{{Sfn | Hughes | 1957}}

Examples of the destruction of pagan temples in the late fourth century, as recorded in surviving texts, are:
* [[Martin of Tours]]' attacks on holy sites in Gaul,&lt;ref name="LifeStMartin"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~eknuth/npnf2-11/sulpitiu/lifeofst.html#14 | title = Life of St. Martin | publisher = CSBSJU}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the destruction of temples in Syria by Marcellus,{{Sfn | Gibbon | 1776–89 | loc = ch. 28}}
* the destruction of temples and images in, and surrounding, Carthage,{{Sfn | MacMullen | 1984}}
* the ruination of the temple at Delphi,
* the desecration of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|mystery cult in Eleusis]],
* the Patriarch Theophilus who seized and destroyed pagan temples in Alexandria,&lt;ref name="CathEnc1912Theophilus"&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] | year = 1912 | contribution = Theophilus | publisher = New Advent}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the levelling of all the temples in Gaza{{Sfn | MacMullen | 1984}}
* and the wider destruction of holy sites that spread rapidly throughout Egypt.{{Sfn | MacMullen | 1984}}

This is supplemented in abundance by archaeological evidence in the northern provinces (for which written sources hardly survive) exposing broken and burnt out buildings and hastily buried objects of piety.{{Sfn | MacMullen | 1984}}  The leader of the Egyptian monks who participated in the sack of temples replied to the victims who demanded back their sacred icons: "I peacefully removed your gods... there is no such thing as robbery for those who truly possess Christ."{{Sfn | MacMullen | 1984}}

After the last [[Ancient Olympic Games]] in 393, it is believed that either Theodosius I, or his grandson [[Theodosius II]] in AD&amp;nbsp;435, suppressed them.&lt;ref name="KotynskiP3"&gt;{{harvnb|Kotynski|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the official records of the Roman Empire, the reckoning of dates by [[Olympiad]]s soon came to an end.

Subsequently Theodosius portrayed himself on his coins holding the ''[[labarum]]''.

According to a Christian historian "Paganism was now dead", though pagans survived and would continue to do so for another three centuries, mainly outwith the towns&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; "rustics chiefly&amp;nbsp;— pagani."&lt;ref name= "hughes" /&gt;{{Sfn | Hughes | 1957}} Edward Gibbon wrote: "The generation that arose in the world after the promulgation of the Imperial laws was attracted within the pale of the Catholic Church: and so rapid, yet so gentle, was the fall of paganism that only twenty-eight years after the death of Theodosius the faint and minute vestiges were no longer visible to the eye of the legislator."{{Sfn | Gibbon citation | 1776–89 | loc = ch. 28 | ps = quotes the decree (16.10.22): 'The pagans who remain, although we believe there are none, etc'; and adds [note 67] 'the younger Theodosius was afterwards satisfied that his judgement had been somewhat premature'.}}

The '''Cube of Space''' is an occult concept that was popularized by the prominent occultist [[Paul Foster Case]]. The Cube of Space associates the three axes of the cube, the center point of the cube, the six sides of the cube, and the twelve edges of the cube, with the 22 letters of the [[hebrew alphabet]]. The Cube of Space is based upon two verses in the proto-[[kabbalah|kabbala]] text called the [[Sepher Yetzirah]]. One of those verses is in chapter 4 and the other verse is in chapter 5. The verse in chapter 4 associates 6 hebrew letters with six cardinal directions (up, down, east, west, north, south). The verse in chapter 5 associates 12 hebrew letters with either 12 diagonal directional 'arms' or 12 diagonal boundaries (different translations contradict each other), which some interpret as referring to the 12 edges of an octahedron, though Paul Foster Case interpreted these as the 12 edges of a cube. In the most authoritative English translation of the Sepher Yetzirah, scholar Aryeh Kaplan interprets this verse (Chapter 5, Verse 2) as describing a cube. (Sefer Yetzirah Page 203) While occult author Kevin Townley explains a cosmology with an octahedron within a cube.

'''Dhutanga''' ([[Pali]] ''dhutaṅga'' "renunciation",&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.dhammadana.org/sangha/dhutanga.htm#ch-----1 The 13 ascetic practices] dhammadana.org&lt;/ref&gt; known in [[Thai language|Thai]] as "Thudong"; {{lang-si|ධුතාඞ්ග}}) is a group of thirteen austerities or ascetic practices most commonly observed by the practitioners of the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]. While the Buddha did not require these practices, they were recommended for those wanting to practice greater asceticism.
==Description==
All [[:Category:Theravada Buddhist monks|Forest Monk]]s will observe at least one of the dhutanga austerities. The dhutanga austerities are meant to deepen the practice of meditation and assist in living the Holy Life. Their aim is to help the practitioner to develop detachment with material things including the body.

==The thirteen dhutanga practices==
#Refuse-rag-wearer's Practice (pamsukulik'anga) — wearing robes made up from discarded or soiled cloth and not accepting and wearing ready-made robes offered by householders.
#Triple-robe-wearer's Practice (tecivarik'anga) — Having and wearing only three robes and not having additional allowable robes.
#Alms-food-eater's Practice (pindapatik'anga) — eating only food collected on pindapata or the almsround while not accepting food in the vihara or offered by invitation in a layman's house.
#House-to-house-seeker's Practice (sapadanik'anga) — not omitting any house while going for alms; not choosing only to go to rich households or those selected for some other reason as relations, etc.
#One-sessioner's practice (ekasanik'anga) — eating one meal a day and refusing other food offered before midday. (Those Gone Forth may not, unless ill, partake of food from midday until dawn the next day.)
#Bowl-food-eater's Practice (pattapindik'anga) — eating food from his bowl in which it is mixed together rather than from plates and dishes.
#Later-food-refuser's Practice (khalu-paccha-bhattik'anga) — not taking any more food after one has shown that one is satisfied, even though lay-people wish to offer more.
#Forest-dweller's Practice (Araññik'anga) — not dwelling in a town or village but living secluded, away from all kinds of distractions.
#Tree-root-dweller's Practice (rukkhamulik'anga) — living under a tree without the shelter of a roof.
#Open-air-dweller's Practice (abbhokasik'anga) — refusing a roof and a tree-root, the practice may be undertaken sheltered by a tent of robes.
#Charnel-ground-dweller's Practice (susanik'anga) — living in or nearby a charnel-field, graveyard or cremation ground (In ancient India there would have been abandoned and unburied corpses as well as some partially cremated corpses in such places.)
#Any-bed-user's Practice (yatha-santhatik'anga) — being satisfied with any dwelling allotted as a sleeping place.
#Sitter's Practice (nesajjik'anga) — living in the three postures of walking, standing and sitting and never lying down.

== Early Practitioners ==
# Maha Kassapa Thero (the greatest among Dhutanga Practitioners)
# Sariputta Thero (the greatest among the Wise and greater among Dhutanga Practitioners)
# Khadiravaniya Revata Thero (the greatest among Forest Dwellers)
# Bakkula Thero (the greatest among Sitters)
# Moghraja Thero (the greatest among Rough Robe Wearers)
# Nalaka Thero (the beginner of Nalaka Patipada)

The '''First Church in Roxbury''', also known as the '''First Church of Roxbury''' is the current headquarters of the [[Unitarian Universalist]] ("UU") Urban Ministry. The church has been in use since 1632 when early [[English people|English]] settlers built the first meetinghouse.{{sfnp|Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry, "The First Church in Roxbury"|2015}} Since then, the meetinghouse has been rebuilt four times,{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=xvii–xviii}} and its appearance today reflects how the meetinghouse looked in the late [[Nineteenth Century|Nineteenth]] and early [[Twentieth Century|Twentieth centuries]].{{sfnp|Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry, "The First Church in Roxbury"|2015}}

==History==

===The First Meeting House (1632–1674)===
The First Church of Roxbury was the sixth church to be gathered by the early English settlers. In 1631, settlers living in Roxbury, who belonged to the Church of Dorchester, were finally self-sufficient enough to create their own church—the First Church of Roxbury. The "official" beginning of the church is recognized as when the first meeting house was constructed the next year. The first meetinghouse served as a central part of the community from 1632–1674.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=1}} The first pastor, [[Thomas Weld (minister)|Reverend Thomas Weld]], was ordained in July 1632 (and it is presumed that that is also when the Church's covenant, a document stated the congregation was officially recognized by the church, was signed).{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=3–4}} There is no definitive record of what the first meeting house looked like,{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=5}} but based on the construction of the time, it was likely a simple, small building with a thatched roof.{{sfnp|Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry, "The First Church in Roxbury"|2015}} The first meeting house served as a central location for the budding community in Roxbury, as the church was a central part of the early settlers lives (many of whom were [[Pilgrim Fathers|fleeing to America for freedom from religious persecution]]). In August, 1645, the congregation decided to create the "Free Schoole in Roxburie" (now [[Roxbury Latin School]]).{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=9–10}} [[Samuel Danforth]], the second pastor of the church, was ordained September 24, 1650.{{sfnp|Thwing|1098|p=38}}

====John Eliot====
{{Main|John Eliot (missionary)}}
[[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] was ordained as the first teacher on November 5, 1632.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=5}} Eliot, as a [[Puritan]] [[missionary]] became known by many as "the apostle to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]"{{sfnp|Moore|1822}}{{sfn|English Bible History: John Eliot}} for learning the Algonquin language (the Native American language spoken in the area at the time). He used this knowledge to translate the ten commandments, the Lord's prayer, and other scriptures into the Algonquin language, to try converting the natives to Puritan [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Promoting and Propagating the Gospel}} Although unintentional, Eliot also introduced the concept of written language as the natives did not previously have a phonetic [[alphabet]]; they communicated primarily through spoken language with their written language being mainly pictorial images (such as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]).{{sfn|English Bible History: John Eliot}}

===The Second Meeting House (1674–1741)===
Due to a growth in population in Roxbury,{{sfnp|Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry, "The First Church in Roxbury"|2015}}{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=14}} as well as the inclusion of residents of [[Brookline, Mass|Muddy River]], who had no place of worship of their own until 1717, in the congregation,{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=69}} a new meeting house was built for the church. The first meeting in this new meeting house took place on November 15, 1674.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=70}} On October 17, 1688, Nehemiah Walter was ordained as a pastor.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=72}} Previously, the meeting house was full of just seats, but the first pews are built sometime around 1693.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=73}} In 1706, residents from "Jamaica End" (the westerly part of Roxbury) asked the general court for permission to be made their own precinct and for help with building their own meeting house, which was denied.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=74}} However, in 1711 they again made the same request signed by thirty-two people, and the request was granted; eighteen members from The First Church in Roxbury were sent off to form [[The Second Church in Roxbury]].{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=75}} Thomas Walter was ordained as a pastor on October 19, 1718.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=76}} The population of Roxbury continued to grow{{sfnp|Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry, "The First Church in Roxbury"|2015}} and finally, in March, 1736, the congregation once again brought up the subject of building a new meeting house; however they were unsure whether to build it on the same spot or to pick a new location. Finally, it was decided that the new meeting house would be built slightly north, and that the old meeting house was to be demolished once the new one began construction.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=83}}

===The Third Meeting House (1741–1744)===
Again due to growing population, a larger meeting house was necessary and in the summer of 1741, the third meeting house was completed; the first meeting was held in the new building on August 31, 1741.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=139}} However, a fire broke out in February 1743 (or 1744), and destroyed the meeting house. The congregation worshipped in the brick schoolhouse until a new meeting house was built.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=142}}{{sfnp|Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry, "The First Church in Roxbury"|2015}}

===The Fourth Meeting House (1744–1803)===
Following the destruction by fire, the fourth meeting house was built on the same location and of the same design{{sfnp|Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry, "The First Church in Roxbury"|2015}} as the former third meeting house and was completed in 1746.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=150}} It continued to serve the congregation as it always had until the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out.

====The Siege of Boston====
{{Main|Siege of Boston}}
From March 29, 1775 (a few weeks before the [[Siege of Boston]], the opening phase of the Revolutionary War, began) until April 8, 1776 (a few weeks after the Siege ended) there were no public meetings held in the meeting house. During the siege, no religious meetings could be held and the meeting house served as a signal station for the army. As such, it was also a target for British bombs, and by the time the British retreated from Boston in 1776, the meeting house had been damaged by bombs in several places.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=163}}{{sfnp|Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry, "The First Church in Roxbury"|2015}} As a result of the war, the members of the parish were scattered, and until 1782 there was no official minister for the church.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=164}}

====Following the American Revolutionary War====
{{Main|American Revolutionary War}}
Once the church named a new pastor in 1782, the church and meeting house largely went back to serving the community and congregation as it always had. Various efforts were made to restore the meeting house following the damage, and in 1787, a group of men who lived near the meeting house presented the church with a clock, which was placed on the bell tower. It was also around this time that the church began officially referring to itself as a parish, rather than a precinct.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=168}} On May 27, 1799, the church voted against building a new meeting house. However, in 1802, another vote was taken and it was decided that measures should be taken to start building a new meeting house for the congregation.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=170–171}} Three different plans were submitted, and after one was chose, it was decided that the old meeting house would be put up at auction.{{sfnp|Thwing|1908|p=177}} On April 17, 1803, the old meeting house was used by the congregation for the last time.

===The Fifth Meeting House===

===Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry===
The Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry is a [[Roxbury, Boston, MA]]-based [[social justice]] organization focused on providing [[nonsectarian]] programs that focus on providing the community with "academic and enrichment programming for children and youth, emergency shelter for individuals and families fleeing from domestic violence, affordable housing and intentional community for young women, including transitional housing for those leaving shelter, and volunteer-based capacity-building services for Roxbury-serving nonprofits."{{sfnp|Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry, "Who We Are"|2015}}

'''Gondophares I''' was the founder of the [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] in western [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Bivar_2003"&gt;{{citation |last=Bivar |first=A. D. H. |chapter=Gondophares |title=Encyclopaedia Iranica |volume=11.2 |year=2003 |location=Costa Mesa |publisher=Mazda |chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gondophares}}&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have ruled c. 20–10 [[Before Christ|BC]] according to modern research.&lt;ref&gt;See main [[Indo-Parthian]] page for references to Robert Senior's modern chronology&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Bopearachchi]] gives a later timeframe of 21–40 AD for his rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Osmund Bopearachchi]], 2007, [https://www.academia.edu/22821570/Some_observations_on_the_chronology_of_the_early_Kushans Some observations on the chronology of the early Kushans]&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally likely a relative or vassal of the [[Apraca]]s, ruling in Apracapura ([[Bajaur]], [[Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]]-[[Pakistan]]) and down in to [[Sistan]] ([[Balochistan]]).

==Rule==
Gondophares I has traditionally been given a later date; the reign of one king calling himself Gondophares has been established at 20 AD by the rock inscription he set up at  [[Takht-i-Bahi]] near [[Mardan]], [[Pakistan]], in 46 AD.,&lt;ref&gt;A. D. H. Bivar, "The History of Eastern Iran", in Ehsan Yarshater (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of Iran,'' Vol.3 (1), ''The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian Periods,'' London, Cambridge University Press, 1983, p.197.&lt;/ref&gt; and he has also been connected with the third-century ''[[Acts of Thomas]]''.

Gondophares I took over the [[Kabul]] valley and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]] region area from the [[Indo-Scythian|Scythian]] king [[Azes]]. In reality, a number of vassal rulers seem to have switched allegiance from the Indo-Scythians to Gondophares I. His empire was vast, but was only a loose framework, which fragmented soon after his death. His capital was the Gandharan city of [[Taxila]].&lt;ref&gt;B. N. Puri, “The Sakas and Indo-Parthians”, in A.H. Dani, V. M. Masson, Janos Harmatta, C. E. Boaworth, ''History of Civilizations of Central Asia,'' Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2003, Chapter 8, p.196&lt;/ref&gt; Taxila is located in Punjab to the west of the present Islamabad. [[Ernst Herzfeld]] claims his name is perpetuated in the name of the Afghan city [[Kandahar]], which he founded under the name Gundopharron.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Herzfeld, ''Archaeological History of Iran,'' London,  Oxford University Press for the British Academy, 1935, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name also occurs in Avestic [[Old Persian|Old Iranian]] as ''Vinda[[Khvarenah|farna]]'' "May he find glory."&lt;ref name="Bivar_2003"/&gt; In old [[Armenian language|Armenian]], it is "Gastaphar". “Gundaparnah” was apparently the Eastern Iranian form of the name.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Boyce and Frantz Genet, ''A History of Zoroastrianism,'' Leiden, Brill, 1991, pp.447–456, n.431.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
[[Image:GondopharesOnHorse.jpg|thumb|Gondophares on horse, from his coinage (Click image for reference).]]
On the coins of Gondophares, the royal names are Iranian, but the other legends of the coins are in Greek and [[Kharoṣṭhī]].

Ernst Herzfeld maintained that the dynasty of Gondophares represented the [[House of Suren]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Herzfeld, ''Archaeological History of Iran,'' London, Oxford University Press for the British Academy, 1935, p.63;  name="Bivar_2003"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt; ''cf.'' &lt;/sup&gt; name="Bivar_1983_51"&gt;{{citation |title=Cambridge History of Iran |volume=3.1 |year=1983 |publisher=Cambridge UP |location=London |editor-last=Yarshater |editor-first=Ehsan |chapter=The Political History of Iran under the Arsacids |last=Bivar |first=A. D. H. |pages=51&lt;!--21–100--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Biblical Magus "Gaspar"==
The name of Gondophares was translated in Armenian in "Gastaphar", and then in Western languages into "Gaspar[d]". He may be the "Gaspar[d], King of Persia", who, according to apocryphal texts and eastern Christian tradition, was one of the three [[Biblical Magi]] who attended the birth of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred von Gutschmid, Die Königsnamen in den apokryphen Apostelgeschichten, in the ''Rheinisches Museum für Philologie'' (1864), XIX, 161-183, nb p.162; Mario Bussagli, "L'art du Gandhara", p.207&lt;/ref&gt; Through this interaction and association, Gaspar[d] was adopted by the Europeans (and in Western tradition) as a male first name.

==Connection with Saint Thomas and Apollonius of Tyana==
[[File:Gondophares receives a letter from St, Thomas.jpg|thumb|Gondophares receives a letter from St. Thomas]]
The apocryphical ''[[Acts of Thomas]]'' mentions one king ''Gudnaphar''. This king has been associated with Gondophares I by many scholars, as it was not yet established that there were several kings with the same name. Richard N. Frye, Emeritus Professor of Iranian Studies at Harvard University, has noted that this ruler has been identified with a king called Caspar in the Christian tradition of the Apostle St Thomas and his visit to India.&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Frye, “The Fall of the Graeco-Bactrians: Sakas and Indo-Parthians”, in Sigfried J. de Laet, ''History of Humanity,'' London, New York and Paris, Routledge and Unesco, Volume III, 1996, Joachim Herrmann and Erik Zürcher (eds.), ''From the Seventh Century BC to the Seventh Century AD,'' p.455.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research by R.C. Senior shows with some certainty that the king who best fits these references was Gondophares-[[Sases]], the fourth king using the title Gondophares.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Senior, ''Indo-Scythian Coins and History,'' Volume 4: Supplement, London, Chameleon Press, (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

A. D. H. Bivar, writing in ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', said that the reign dates of one Gondophares recorded in the Takht-i Bahi inscription (20–46 or later AD) are consistent with the dates given in the ''Apocryphal Acts of Thomas'' for the Apostle's voyage to India following the Crucifixion in c. 30 AD.&lt;ref&gt;W. Wright (transl.), ''The Apocryphal Acts of Thomas,'' Leiden, Brill, 1962, p.146; cited in A. D. H. Bivar, "The History of Eastern Iran", in Ehsan Yarshater (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of Iran,'' Vol.3 (1), ''The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian Periods,'' London, Cambridge University Press, 1983, p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;India and the Apostle Thomas, A. E. Medlycott, fully reproduced with illustrations (including the coins of Gondaphares) in the Indian Church History Classics ed. George Menachery, Ollur, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; B. N. Puri, of the Department of Ancient Indian History and Archaeology, University of Lucknow, India, also identified Gondophares with the ruler said to have been converted by Saint Thomas the Apostle.&lt;ref&gt;B. N. Puri, “The Sakas and Indo-Parthians”, in János Harmatta, B. N. Puri and G.F. Etemadi (editors), ''History of civilizations of Central Asia,'' Paris, UNESCO, Vol.II, 1994, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; The same goes for the reference to an Indo-Parthian king in the accounts of the life of [[Apollonius of Tyana]]. Puri says that the dates given by Philostratus in his ''Life of Apollonius of Tyana'' for Apollonius' visit to Taxila, 43–44 AD, are within the period of the reign of Gondophares I, who also went by the Parthian name, Phraotes.&lt;ref&gt;Puri, “The Sakas and Indo-Parthians”, p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;
Saint Thomas was brought before King Gundaphar (Gondophares) at his capital, Taxila.&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Medlycott, India and the Apostle Thomas, London, David Nutt, 1905, Chapter 1, “The Apostle Thomas and Gondophares the Indian King”&lt;/ref&gt; "Taxila" is the Greek form of the contemporary Pali name for the city, “Takkasila”, from the Sanskrit “Taksha-sila”. The name of the city was transformed in subsequent legends concerning Thomas, which were consolidated into the ''Historia Trium Regum (History of the Three Kings)'' by John of Hildesheim (1364–1375), into "Silla", "Egrisilla", "Grisculla", and so on,&lt;ref&gt;Frank Schaer, The ''Three Kings of Cologne,'' Heidelberg, Winter, 2000, Middle English Texts no.31, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; the name having undergone a process of metamorphosis similar to that which transformed “Vindapharnah” (Gondophares) to “Caspar”. 
Hildesheim's ''Historia Trium Regum'' says: “In the third India is the kingdom of Tharsis, which at that time was ruled over by King Caspar, who offered incense to our Lord. The famous island Eyrisoulla [or Egrocilla] lies in this land: it is there that the holy apostle St Thomas is buried”.&lt;ref&gt;Joannes of Hildesheim, ''The Three Kings of Cologne: An Early English Translation of the "Historia Trium Regum" together with the Latin Text,'' London, Trubner, 1886; repr. Elibron Classics, 2001, cap.xi, pp.227–28; translation by F.H. Mountney, ''The Three Kings of Cologne,'' Gracewing Publishing, 2003, pp.31, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Egrisilla" appears on the globe made in Nuremberg by [[Martin Behaim]] in 1492, where it appears on the southernmost part of the peninsula of Hoch India, “High India” or “India Superior”, on the eastern side of the [[Sinus Magnus]] ("Great Gulf", the [[Gulf of Thailand]]): there Egrisilla is identified with the inscription, ''das lant wird genant egtisilla,'' (“the land called Egrisilla”). In his study of Behaim's globe, [[Ernst Georg Ravenstein|E. G. Ravenstein]] noted: “Egtisilla, or Eyrisculla [or Egrisilla: the letters “r” and “t” in the script on the globe look similar], is referred to in John of Hildesheim’s version of the ‘Three Kings’ as an island where St. Thomas lies buried".&lt;ref&gt;E. G. Ravenstein, ''Martin Behaim: His Life and His Globe,'' London, George Philip, 1908, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5825">Gudiya is the name of an [[Indian Muslims|Indian Muslim]] woman who was tragically affected by the [[Kargil war]] and whose plight was prominently highlighted by the [[print media|print]] and [[electronic media]].&lt;ref name = rediff1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.co.in/news/2004/sep/23spec.htm|title=Prisoner of woe: Private horror behind Gudiya's public trial|publisher=[[rediff.com]]|accessdate= March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was married to Arif in 1999, 10 days before the [[sapper]] was called on duty to [[Kargil war|Kargil]]. Arif failed to return from the war and was declared an [[desertion|army deserter]] until the authorities realised that he had been taken prisoner of war and was in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=60851|title=Gudiya's child is mine, I will keep him forever: Arif|publisher= [[The New Indian Express]]|accessdate = March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meanwhile, the 26-year-old woman, thinking Arif had died,  had been remarried by her relatives to another man, Taufiq in 2003, and was pregnant with his child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/19594.html| title = Gudiya's death upsets filmmaker|publisher = Indiaglitz.com|accessdate = March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A twist in Gudiya's life surfaced when the [[Pakistan]]is finally released Arif and he returned home to a warm welcome. Gudiya was then living with her parents in Kalunda village on the outskirts of [[Delhi]]. Gudiya then moved to Mundali village in [[Meerut]] district of [[Uttar Pradesh]] – about 75&amp;nbsp;km from [[Delhi]] at her [[inlaws]] house. She told the [[news media|media]] assembled at the Village [[Panchayati Raj|Panchayat]] that she wanted go with her first husband. The [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]] present in the audience at that point of time applauded her decision, proclaiming it to be in accordance with the [[Sharia]]t . The second marriage, they claimed, was illegal.&lt;ref name = rediff1/&gt;

However, an investigation by [[Rediff.com|Rediff]] revealed that Gudiya reverted to her first husband Arif under pressure from him, his family members, the villagers and most importantly, the religious leaders. In fact, Gudiya herself asserted dominant pressure in her decision by saying "It was everybody's decision". The entire process of Gudiya favouring her first husband over the second husband Taufeeq was done without informing the latter. Also, Gudiya's uncle Riyasat Ali said, "She was pressured by the people there. She was not allowed to speak. The clerics told her that she had to follow the Shariat and go to Arif. They said her son would become illegitimate if she did not. Taufeeq, on the other hand, said Gudiya had spoken to him on telephone five days before this incident. She had explained to him the pressure she was being under. Her father had even threatened to commit suicide if she did not go back to Arif.&lt;ref name = rediff1/&gt;
Arif, who had proclaimed that it was his love for Gudiya which brought him back, declared he was ready to take his wife back but not the step-child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-01-03/india/27805323_1_gudiya-painful-death-dilemma|title = Gudiya's mute story ends in death| publisher = [[Times of India]]|accessdate = March 23, 2013|date=January 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turbulent reunion with her first husband ==
Arif, after initial reluctance, had agreed to accept his wife with the unborn baby with a caveat that he might send the child back to Taufiq after he grew up. She gave birth a month later. She also developed [[anaemia]], suffered a miscarriage a couple of months later, underwent bouts of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and had many [[gynecology|gynecological]] problems. 15 months after the reunion, she succumbed to [[septicaemia]] in the Army Research and Referral Hospital in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060103/asp/frontpage/story_5675062.asp|title=Gudiya did not live happily ever after - Woman scarred by war, separation and reunion dies of miscarriage fallout|publisher = [[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|accessdate = March 23, 2013|location=Calcutta, India|date=January 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A probable cause of depression for Gudiya was the fact that her brother-in-law and his wife taunted her because they thought she was unlucky, for, within a few days of the marriage, Arif had gone to fight in the [[Kargil war|war]] and went missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.telegraphindia.com/1040921/asp/frontpage/story_3784649.asp| title = Father of unborn child counts his losses - Forsaken husband in shock, family blames girl's stepmother for separation|publisher = [[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|accessdate = March 23, 2013|location=Calcutta, India|first=Ayswaria|last=Venugopal|date=September 21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film on the life of Gudiya ==
Ad-filmmaker Prabhakar Shukla's first feature film, 'Kahaani Gudiya Ki' is based on the life of Gudiya. He said even though the lady died, the issue that the happenings raised is very much relevant. "My film is not only about what happened with Gudiya, but it's a panoramic view of the entire episode from Gudiya's point of view. That's besides paying homage to her," says Shukla, adding, "Gudiya died due to excessive mental trauma that led to multiple organ failure. Her death is the most tragic part of the entire episode, and the film questions why it happened to her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=488650|title= Film on Gudiya to be screened at Osian's film fest|publisher = [[Outlook India]]|accessdate = March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of Arabs in Afghanistan''' spans over one [[millennium]], from the 11th century [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Islamic conquest]] when [[Arabs]] arrived with their [[Islamic Missionary Activity|Islamic mission]]&lt;ref name="Ferishta"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=06901021&amp;ct=10|title=''History of the Mohamedan Power in India''|author=[[Firishta|Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah]] (1560–1620)|publisher=[[Packard Humanities Institute]]|work=Persian Literature in Translation|accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Owens"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arabic as a minority language|last1=Owens|first1=Jonathan|authorlink=|volume=|year=2000|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location=|isbn= 9783110165784|page=181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ih6b9iupT6oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Arabic%20As%20a%20Minority%20Language&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; until recently when others from the [[Arab world]] arrived to defend fellow [[Muslim]]s from the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Union]] followed by [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|NATO forces]]. Most of the early [[Arab people|Arabs]] gradually lost their Arabic [[hegemony]] and ultimately mixed with the [[Demography of Afghanistan|local population]], though they are still considered a cognizably distinct ethnic group according to the [[Constitution of Afghanistan]] and the [[Afghan National Anthem]]. Afghans who carry [[Sayed]] or [[Quraishi]] in their names usually claim Arab [[ancestry]].

==First wave==
{{Further|Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Siege of Herat (643 CE)|Battle of Oxus River}}
[[File:Ancient Khorasan highlighted.jpg|thumb|Names of territories during the [[Caliphate]]]]
[[File:Afghanistan 14.jpg|thumb|The [[Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque]] in [[Kabul]]]]
At the end of the 7th century, the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Arabs]] entered into the area now known as Afghanistan after decisively defeating the [[Sassanid Empire]] in [[Battle of Nahāvand|Nihawand]]. Following this colossal defeat, the last Sassanid Emperor, [[Yazdegerd III]], who became a hunted fugitive, fled eastward deep into [[Central Asia]]. In pursuing Yazdegerd, the route the Arabs selected to enter the area was from north-eastern [[Iran]] and thereafter into [[Herat]] where they stationed a large portion of their army before advancing toward eastern [[Name of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Owens"/&gt; Some Arabs settled in these new areas and married locals while adopting new customs. Other groups and contingents who elected not to settle gradually pushed eastwards but encountered resistance in areas surrounding [[Bamiyan Province|Bamiyan]].&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Afghanistan By Hafizullah Emadi, pg.27&lt;/ref&gt; When ultimately arriving at [[Kabul]], the Arabs confronted the [[Shahi|Kabul Shahan]] who had built a long defensive wall around the city. The bloodiest war in Kabul was in Chahardihi area where still tombs of Arabs killed in that war exist in DarulAman area. The most famous Arab character killed in that war was Shah-do Shamshira, whose tomb is located near Kabul river in Asmayee st. One of the most famous Commanders who fought against Arab invaders is known as ''Mazangi''. Mazangi was in command at the battle of ''Asmayee'' (Kohi-Sherdarwaza) where Shah-Do Shamshira was killed. There is a number sights where Arab invaders fought in Kabul, but the bloodiest battle after Asmayee was the battle of Alwoden in the area known as [[Darul Aman Palace|Darul Aman]] today. The historical details of this battle remains largely unknown, though the Arabs were nonetheless subdued in the long term. {{quote|''In the year [[Islamic calendar|44]] (664 AD), the Caliph Moavia Bin Aby Soofian nominated Zeead, the son of Oomya, to the government of Bussora, [[Sistan|Seestan]], and Khorassan. In the same year also [[Abdur Rahman|Abdool Ruhman Bin Shimur]], another Arab Ameer of distinction, marched from [[Merv|Murv]] to Kabul, where he made converts of upwards of twelve thousand persons... Saad was recalled in the year 59, and Abdool Ruhman, the son of Zeead, who formerly invaded Kabul, was nominated ruler of Khorassan... Shortly after his arrival in Khorassan, Sulim deputed his brother, Yezeed Bin Zeead, to Seestan. Not long after, Yezeed, having learned that the Prince of Kabul, throwing off his allegiance, had attacked and taken prisoner Aby Oobeyda, the son of Zeead, the late governor of Seestan, he marched with a force to recover that province, but was defeated in a pitched battle. When Sulim heard this news, he sent Tilla Bin Abdoolla, an officer of his court, as envoy to the court of Kabul, to ransom Aby Oobeyda; to obtain which object he paid 500,000 dirhems.  Tilla afterwards received the government of Seestan as a reward for his services on this occasion, where, having collected a large force, he subdued Kabul in the short term and [[Khalid (disambiguation)|Khalid Bin Abdoolla]] (said by some to be the son of [[Khalid (disambiguation)|Khalid Bin Wuleed]], and by others the son of Aboo Jehl) was nominated to its government.''&lt;ref name="Ferishta"/&gt;|[[Firishta|Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah]]|(1560–1620)}}

Despite the lack of much written accounts, another famous archaeological legacy of this battle remains standing in Kabul, notably the tomb of the [[Shah]]-e Do [[Shamshir]]a (translated into, ''The leader with the Two Swords'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]) next to the [[Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque]]. The site, located near Kabul's market district, was built near the area where an [[Ghazi (warrior)|Arab commander]] died. {{quote|''Despite fighting heroically with a sword in each hand, one of the Muslim head commanders fell in battle. It is his memory that is honored by the mosque today. The two-story edifice was built in the 1920s on the order of [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]]'s mother on the site of one of Kabul's first mosques.''}}

Following the Arab confrontation, the region was made part of Khorasan with its seat of power in Herat in the west. The Arabs later partially relinquished some of their territorial control though reasserted its authority approximately 50 years later in 750 when the [[Abbasid]] caliphs replaced the [[Ummayad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Afghanistan In A Nutshell By Amanda Roraback, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; By then, many Arabs increasingly blended with locals as the Arabic identity in the region began to undergo a significant change. Arab contingents settled throughout various parts of present-day Afghanistan including the [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]], [[Logar province|Logar]], [[Kabul]], [[Balkh]] and in the [[Sulaiman Mountains]]. Over time they adopted local customs and languages, some became [[Persianization|Persianized]] while others became [[Pashtunization|Afghanized]] who followed [[Pashtunwali]]. {{Quote|''Khalid being subsequently superseded, became apprehensive of returning to [[Arabia]] by the route of [[Persia]], on account of the enemies he had in that country, and equally so of remaining in Kabul, under his successor. He retired, therefore, with his family, and a number of Arab retainers, into the [[Sulaiman Mountains|Sooli-many mountains]], situated between [[Multan|Mooltan]] and [[Peshawar|Pishawur]], where he took up his residence, and gave his daughter in marriage to one of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] [[tribal chief|chiefs]], who had become a proselyte to [[Islam|Maho-medism]]. From this marriage many children were born, among whom were two sons famous in history. The one [[Lodi (Pashtun tribe)|Lody]], the other [[Sur (Pashtun)|Soor]]; who each, subsequently, became head of the tribes which to this day bear their name.''&lt;ref name="Ferishta"/&gt;|Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah|(1560–1620)}}

It was during the reign of the [[Yaqub Saffar|Ya'qub Saffari]] that Arabic began losing its influence in the region. Nevertheless, the Arabs attempted to re-exert their influence in the area by supporting the [[Samanid]] rulers of Balkh who in return, assisted the Abbasid Arabs against the defiant [[Saffarid dynasty]].

Despite maintaining some clothing customs and attire,&lt;ref&gt;Arabic As a Minority Language By Jonathan Owens, pg. 182&lt;/ref&gt; most the early Afghan-Arabs (or Arab-Afghans) gradually lost their original tongue of Arabic. This is confirmed in the 15th century work, [[Baburnama]], which notes that the Arabs of Afghanistan have virtually lost the [[Arabic language]] and instead speak [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Pashto language]].&lt;ref name="Owens"/&gt; Although the exact number of Arab-Afghans remains unknown, mostly due to ambiguous claims of descent, an 18th-century academic estimated that they number at approximately 60,000 families.&lt;ref name="Owens"/&gt;

==Second wave==
{{History of Afghanistan}}
{{Further|Arab diaspora|Persecution of Muslims}}
After the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], many [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Arabs residing in [[Bukhara]] and other areas of [[Central Asia]] ruled by Russians migrated to Afghanistan where they were better able to practice their religion without fear of religious persecution or discrimination.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0043)|title=Arab|author=|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|work=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan|year=1997|accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate indicated that approximately 30,000 Arabs lived in Bukhara during the mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires By James Stuart Olson, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabs who entered into Afghanistan during this time still retained some Arabic&lt;ref&gt;Arabic As a Minority Language By Jonathan Owens, pg. 183&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the Afghan Arabs who came during the first wave.

Some Arabs from the second wave intermarried with the local population as they adopted the languages of northern Afghanistan, namely [[uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], and Persian language.&lt;ref&gt;Arabic As a Minority Language By Jonathan Owens, pg. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Many settled in [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]], [[Takhar Province|Takhar]] and [[Sar-e Pol Province|Sar-e Pol]] provinces. Currently, while they still view themselves as Arab, all the Arabs from the second wave have, like those from the original wave, lost their language of Arabic, adopting Persian instead.&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt;

Although some tribal names, including [[Qureshi]] and [[Bani Shaiba|Shaiboni]] are still remembered,&lt;ref&gt;Islamic peoples of the Soviet Union, by Shirin Akiner, pg. 367&lt;/ref&gt; most of the Arabs view genealogies as unimportant.&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/EthnicityAndTribe.html|title=Ethnicity and Tribe|author=Luke Griffin|publisher=[[List of Illinois Institute of Technology buildings|Paul V. Galvin Library]]|work=[[Illinois Institute of Technology]]|date=January 14, 2002|accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these Afghan Arabs work in the agricultural industry, often growing cotton and wheat while others raise [[Karakul (sheep)|karakul sheep]].&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt; According to an academic, the [[Central Asian]] Arabs have not had any contact with [[Middle Eastern]] Arabs since the time of [[Tamerlane]] (circa 1400).&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

The main body of the Afghan Arabs are found in [[Shibarghan]] provinces. Afghan Arabs, however, are presently all [[Dari language|Dari-speaking]] and have been in their collective memories. However, they claim an Arab identity. There are other such Persian-speaking "Arabs" to the east, between Shebergan, [[Mazar-i Sharif]], [[Kholm, Afghanistan|Kholm]] and [[Kunduz]] living in pockets. Their self-identification as Arabs is largely based on their tribal identity and may in fact point to the 7th and 8th centuries migration to this and other Central Asian locales of many Arab tribes from Arabia in the wake of the Islamic conquests of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Barfield (1982), p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third wave==
{{Further|Afghan Arabs}}
During the 1980s [[Soviet–Afghan War]], many Arab Muslims arrived and volunteered to help Afghans fight [[Soviet Union]]. Some of these remained after the Soviets withdrew from the country and were granted citizenship. Others intermarried with local Afghans while some arrived with their families to Afghanistan. [[Kandahar]] is home to a small Arab cemetery where over 70 graves belong to Arab [[al-Qaeda]] functionaries who were killed as a result of the U.S. [[War on Terror]]. These Arabs are revered by the [[Taliban]] and the [[Salafist]] sympathizers as [[shahid]] ([[martyr]]s).&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7193579.stm|title=Kandahar's cemetery of 'miracles' |author=Dawood Azami|publisher=[[BBC News]]|work=BBC Pashto service|date=January 17, 2008|accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional groups==

===Balkh===
Around 900 families live in Khoshal Abad and Yakhdan villages of Dawlat Abad district of the province, the villagers can trace their lineage back to the third caliphate of Uthman, in the 7th century. These families are mainly engaged in agriculture and carpet weaving. Most Arabs in [[Balkh Province]], speak in [[Arabic]] as their mother tongue, and [[Dari language|Dari]] as a second language. While some of the older generation had never learned to speak either of Afghanistan’s two official languages, Dari and Pashto, many of the younger generation were being taught Dari in school and forgetting their Arabic; about 40 percent can no longer speak Arabic. Many of their customs have been forgotten, or are no longer relevant to a younger generation that identifies more with Afghanistan. Arabs who settled in northern Balkh province are worried that their culture is being wiped out as more people adopt the language and traditions of Afghanistan. [[Arabs]] form the smaller minorities in the town and district of [[Kholm, Afghanistan|Kholm]]; many identify themselves as ethnic Arabs although no one actually speaks Arabic.&lt;ref name="pajhwok"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/03/09/arabs-balkh-fear-language-culture-dying|title=Arabs in Balkh fear language, culture is dying |author=Zabiullah Ehsas|publisher=[[Pajhwok Afghan News]]|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jowzjan===
There are about 1,000 families living in Hassanabad of Shebarghan, capital of Jowzjan province, and in Sultan Arigh village of Aqcha district that identify themselves as Arabs.&lt;ref name="pajhwok" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtar News&lt;/ref&gt; None, however, has spoken Arabic in their collective memory, with [[Dari language|Dari]] forming their native language.

'''Hong Yi''' (23 October 1880 &amp;ndash; 13 October 1942; {{zh|c=弘一|p=Hóngyī}}), born '''Li Shutong''' (李叔同) was a [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] [[Buddhist monk]], artist and art teacher. He also went by the names Wen Tao, Guang Hou, and Shu Tong, but was most commonly known by his Buddhist name, Hong Yi. He was a master painter, musician, dramatist, calligrapher, seal cutter, poet, and Buddhist monk.

==Life==
[[File:LiShutong.jpg|left|thumb|Hong Yi]]
He was born in [[Tianjin]] to a banking family originating in [[Hongtong County]], [[Shanxi]], that migrated to Tianjin in the [[Ming Dynasty]], though his mother was from [[Pinghu]], [[Zhejiang]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phlst.cn/shutong/ |title=平湖市李叔同紀念館——李叔同簡介 |publisher=Phlst.cn |date=2008-08-18 |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 Li moved to [[Shanghai]] and joined the "Shanghai Painting and Calligraphy Association", and the "Shanghai Scholarly Society" while he was attending the [[Nanyang Public School]] (later became [[National Jiaotong University|Jiaotong University]]). In 1905 Li went to Japan to study at [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Tokyo School of Fine Art]] in [[Ueno Park]] where he specialized in Western painting and music, and met a lover by the name of Yukiko who was to become his concubine.&lt;ref&gt;[[C.C. Liu]] (2010) ''A Critical History of New Music in China''. The Chinese University Press, 2010 {{ISBN|962-996-360-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Micic |url=http://animperfectpen.blogspot.com/2009/02/li-shutong-and-writing-lifes-stories.html |title=Li Shutong and Writing Life's Stories |publisher=Animperfectpen.blogspot.com |date=2009-02-15 |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 Li returned to China and was appointed to Tianjin's Beiyang Advanced Industry School. The next year he was appointed as a music teacher in a girls' school in Shanghai. He went to [[Hangzhou]] in 1912 and became a lecturer in the Zhejiang Secondary Normal College (now [[Hangzhou Normal University]]). He taught not only Western painting and music but also art history. By 1915 [[Jiang Qian]] hired him as a teacher at Nanjing Higher Normal School (renamed in 1949 to [[Nanjing University]]), where he taught painting and music. He also taught at [[Zhejiang Secondary Normal School]] (浙江兩級師範學堂), the predecessor of the famous [[Hangzhou High School]].

During these later years, Li's reputation grew, as he became the first Chinese educator to use nude models in his painting classes, not to mention as the first teacher of Western music in China. Some of the students, like Singapore artist [[Chen Wen Hsi]] (陳文希）whom he personally groomed, went on to become accomplished masters of the arts in their later days. Li Shutong himself was also an accomplished composer and lyricist. Many of his compositions are still remembered and performed today.

In 1916, Li underwent a 21-day fast at a temple in Hangzhou, and experienced the benefit of a spiritual life. The following year, he took refuge in the [[Three Jewels]] of Buddhism. After spending another year there, Li began a new chapter in his life by choosing to be ordained as a monk, and thus began a holistic life dedicated to propagating Buddhism and its code of conduct. After becoming a monk he practised only calligraphy, developing a simple and unadorned, yet unique style, which was treasured by everyone who received a sample. He became known to all as Master Hong Yi. In 1942, Master Hong Yi died peacefully at the age of 61 in [[Quanzhou]], [[Fujian]] Province.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4626">The '''International Club for Psychical Research''' (ICPR) was a short-lived [[Parapsychology|psychical]] organization that was formed in May 1911 by [[Annie Besant]].&lt;ref name= "The Sun"&gt;Anonymous. (1911). [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1911-09-24/ed-1/seq-19/ ''A London Club For Ghosts: Accommodations for Spooks at the New Home of the International Club for Psychical Research'']. ''[[The Sun (New York)]]''. September 24, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Joseph E. (1989). ''Krotona of Old Hollywood, 1866–1913''. El Montecito Oaks Press. pp. 82–83. {{ISBN|978-0925943118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ICPR was considered a rival organization to the [[Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1911). ''Spooks Are Encouraged: London Club Invites Messages From the Spirit World''. ''[[The Washington Post]]''. June 11, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arno C. Gaebelein|Gaebelein, Arno C]]. (1914). [https://archive.org/stream/currenteventsinl00gaeb#page/104/mode/2up ''Current Events in the Light of the Bible'']. New York. pp. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the club were situated in [[Regent Street]], London near [[Piccadilly Circus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lilian Whiting|Whiting, Lilian]]. (1914). [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89098879273;view=1up;seq=204 ''The Lure of London'']. Little, Brown and Company. pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt;

The club held a [[séance]] room for testing spiritualist mediums, a lecture hall, library, dining room and two kitchens.&lt;ref name="The Sun"/&gt; Its membership was open to any belief system but mainly consisted of [[Occultism|occultists]], [[Spiritualism|spiritualists]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]]. The ''International Psychic Gazette'' was a monthly periodical founded in 1912 as the official organ of the ICPR but ceased after a few months. It was revived as an independent publication, the ''Psychic Gazette'' by Scottish businessman and editor John Lewis. It survived for over twenty years, 1913–1935.&lt;ref name="IAPSOP"&gt;[http://www.iapsop.com/archive/materials/international_psychic_gazette/ "Periodical: International Psychic Gazette"]. The International Association for the Preservation of Spiritualist and Occult Periodicals.&lt;/ref&gt; Continental editors were [[Pascal Forthuny]] and [[Felicia Rudolphina Scatcherd]].&lt;ref name="IAPSOP"/&gt;

The first westerner, Frank Humphreys met [[Ramana Maharshi]] in 1911 and wrote articles about him which were published in the ''International Psychic Gazette'' in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Osborne (writer)|Osborne, Arthur]]. (1959). ''The Mind of Ramana Maharshi''. Jaico Publishing House. pp. 106–111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton|Melton, J. Gordon]]. (2013). ''The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena''. Visible Ink. p. 16. {{ISBN|978-1578592098}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Arvind Sharma]] his account "has been widely viewed as an excellent summation of Ramana Maharshi's teachings."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arvind Sharma|Sharma, Arvind]]. (2006). ''Ramana Maharshi: The Sage of Arunachala''. Penguin Books. p. 81. {{ISBN|978-0670058303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributors to the ''Psychic Gazette'' included [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], Horace Leaf, [[James Martin Peebles]] and [[Lilian Whiting]].&lt;ref name="IAPSOP"/&gt; In 1911, the club was reported to have had six hundred members.&lt;ref name="The Sun"/&gt; Known members included [[Lyman J. Gage]], [[Lord Edward Gleichen]], [[Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick]], [[Alfred Edward Turner]] and [[Francis Younghusband]].&lt;ref name="The Sun"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1911). [https://archive.org/stream/secularthought37torouoft#page/254/mode/2up ''Union Of Theosophy and Spiritualism''].

'''[[Irreligion]]''' is common throughout all provinces and territories of '''[[Canada]]'''. Irreligious Canadians include  [[atheists]], [[agnostics]], and [[humanists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last =Zuckerman |first =Phil  |coauthor= |year =2010 |title =Atheism and Secularity: Issues, concepts, and definitions |url =https://books.google.ca/books?id=Z1hbaAHsAlUC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA10&amp;dq=atheists%20in%20Canada&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |publisher= Praeger|isbn=	9780313351815 |accessdate =2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surveys '''may''' also include those who are [[deists]],  [[spirtuality|spiritual]]  and [[pantheists]]. The [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Canadian census]] reported that 23.9% of Canadians declare [[Irreligion|no religious]] affiliation.&lt;ref name="census2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/130508/dq130508b-eng.htm?HPA |title=Religions in Canada—Census 2011 |publisher=Statistics Canada/Statistique Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]], among those estimated 4.9 million Canadians of no religion, an estimated 1.9 million would specify atheist, 1.8 million would specify agnostic, and 1.2 million humanist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/can_rel2.htm |title=Non-Christian religious data in Canada |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveys and public opinion polls==
In 2011, a survey conducted by [[Ipsos-Reid]] showed that 47% of the Canadian population believed religion does more harm in the world than good, while 64% believed that religion provides more questions than answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=5328 |title=Canadians Split On Whether Religion Does More Harm in the World than Good |date=Sep 12, 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 Canadian Press Harris-Decima telephone survey of just over 1,000 Canadians found 23% were willing to state they do not believe in any god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/06/03/f-religion-poll.html |title=Almost a quarter of Canadians don't believe in any god, new poll says |date=Jun 3, 2008|work=CBC News}}A sample of the same size has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Ipsos-Reid poll released September 12, 2011 entitled "Canadians Split On Whether Religion Does More Harm in the World than Good", sampled 1,129 Canadian adults and came up with 30% who do not believe in a god. The same poll found that 33% of respondents who identified themselves as Catholics and 28% Protestants said they didn't believe in a god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=5328 |title=Canadians Split On Whether Religion Does More Harm in the World than Good &amp;#124; Ipsos |publisher=Ipsos-na.com |date=Sep 12, 2011 |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 80-questions mail-in survey of 420 Canadians by Carleton University Survey Centre and the Montreal-based Association for Canadian Studies found 30% agreed with the statement "I know God really exists and I have no doubts", 20% acknowledged they "have doubts" but "feel that I do believe in God", 10% answered they believe in God "sometimes", 20% said they don't believe in a "personal God" but "do believe in a higher power", 12% adopted the classic agnostic position and said they "don't know whether there is a God and don't believe there is a way to find out", and 7% said no god exists. Slightly more than half believed in heaven, while less than a third believed in hell, with 53.5% saying they believed in life after death. About 27% said they believe in reincarnation, and 50% expressed belief in religious miracles.&lt;ref&gt;The results of this survey are considered accurate to within 4.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

==Associations==
Some non-religious Canadians have formed associations, such as the [[Humanist Association of Canada]], [[Centre for Inquiry Canada]], [[Toronto Secular Alliance]], or the [https://www.canadianatheists.ca/ Canadian atheists]. In 1999, some non-religious Canadians signed a petition to remove "God" from the preamble to the [[Canadian Constitution]]. [[Svend Robinson]], who tabled this petition in Parliament, was subsequently relegated to the backbenches by his party leader.&lt;ref name="Bowen2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kurt Bowen|title=Christians in a Secular World: The Canadian Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__38sGZLrvYC&amp;pg=PA287|year=2005|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |isbn=978-0-7735-2712-6|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the same group petitioned to remove "God" from the Canadian national anthem, "[[O Canada]]", but to no avail.

==Irreligion by province==
The Canadian provinces and territories ranked by percentage of population claiming no religion according to the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 Canadian Census]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census01/products/analytic/companion/rel/contents.cfm|title=Religions in Canada, 2001 Census|author=StatCan Staff|publisher=[[Statistics Canada]]|date=2003-05-13|accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Canadian Census]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/130508/dq130508b-eng.htm?HPA&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Ishvara Gita''' (Devanagari: ईश्वर गीता, IAST: {{IAST|Īśvara Gītā}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] text composed in India. It contains the teachings of the god [[Shiva]], also called [[Ishvara]], and is influenced by the [[Samkhya]] and [[Yoga]] schools of Indian philosophy. Bhagavat Gita was influenced by the Shiva Gita which was much more ancient than the Bhagavat Gita. It makes up the first 11 chapters of the second section (uttara vibhaga) of the [[Kurma Purana]].

Some verses of the Bhagavad Gita  are directly repeated from the Ishvara Gita but Ishvara Gita also contains many new themes, such as the worship of the [[linga]] and the idea that [[Shiva]], not [[Krishna]], is the ultimate god. The Ishvara Gita also shows the influence of the 8-fold (ashtanga) yoga of [[Patanjali]], and of the [[Pashupata]] sect of [[Shaivism]]. Several commentaries on this text are available in manuscript form, including one by [[Vijnanabhiksu]], a 16th-century Hindu [[polymath]].

The Ishvara Gita has been translated into English, French and Italian in stand-alone form, and into English as part of a complete translation of the [[Kurma Purana]].

Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; with various Islamic groups or thinkers espousing views on the matter which have been radically different throughout history.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis 1994, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html Ch.1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010401012040/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |date=2001-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was a mainstay of life in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] and surrounding lands.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt; It was in this social milieu that Islam emerged, whence the [[Quran]] and the ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) address slavery extensively, assuming its existence as part of society but viewing it as an exceptional condition and restricting its scope.&lt;ref name="eois"&gt;Brunschvig.

The sharīʿah (divine law) regarded as legal slaves only those non-Muslims who were imprisoned or bought beyond the borders of Islamic rule, or the sons and daughters of slaves already in captivity.&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt; In later [[Sharia|classical Islamic law]], the topic of slavery is covered at great length.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; Slaves, be they Muslim or those of any other religion, were equal to their fellow practitioners in religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;See: Martin (2005), pp.150 and 151; Clarence-Smith (2006), p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, slavery in Islamic law does not have a racial or color component, although this has not always been the case in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''Race and Color in Islam,'' Harper and Row, 1970, quote on page 38. The brackets are displayed by Lewis.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves played various social and economic roles, from domestic worker to high-ranking positions in the government like [[Emir]]. Moreover, slaves were widely employed in irrigation, mining, pastoralism, and the army. Some rulers even relied on military and administrative slaves to such a degree that they seized power. In some cases, the treatment of slaves was so harsh that it led to uprisings, such as the [[Zanj Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarence-Smith (2006), pp.2-5&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was an exception rather than the norm, as the vast [[Islamic economics in the world#Labour force|majority of labor]] in the medieval [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] consisted of free, [[Wage labour|paid labour]].&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery from Roman times to the early transatlantic trade|author=William D. Phillips|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=1985|isbn=0-7190-1825-0|page=76|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a variety of reasons, internal growth of the slave population was not enough to fulfill the demand in Muslim society. This resulted in massive importation, which involved enormous suffering and loss of life from the capture and transportation of slaves from non-Muslim lands.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran provides for [[manumission|emancipation]] of a slave as a means of religious atonement for sins.&lt;ref name="Holy Quran Exegesis by ibn Kathir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2426&amp;Itemid=79|title=Quran Tafsir Ibn Kathir - The Command to grant Slaves a Contract of Emancipation|first=Administrator|last=N|website=www.qtafsir.com|access-date=2014-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402031805/http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2426&amp;Itemid=79|archive-date=2015-04-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|reason=This is a dubious questionable interpretation of this verse|date=June 2017}}

The Arab slave trade was most active in West Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Africa. In the early 20th century (post [[World War I]]), slavery was gradually outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; For example, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]] only abolished slavery in 1962 under pressure from Britain; [[Oman]] followed suit in 1970, and [[Mauritania]] in 1905, 1981, and again in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Martin A. Klein (2002), Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition, Page xxii, {{ISBN|0810841029}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, slavery claiming the sanction of Islam is documented presently in the predominantly Islamic countries of [[Chad]], [[Mauritania]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]], and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;Segal, page 206. See later in article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segal, page 222. See later in article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early converts to Islam were the poor and former slaves. One notable example is [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]].&lt;ref&gt;The Qur'an with Annotated Interpretation in Modern English By Ali Ünal [https://books.google.com/books?id=DyuqdDIjaswC&amp;pg=PA1323 page 1323]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], Slaves and Slavery&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bilal b. Rabah, [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Islam'' (1977), p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery in pre-Islamic Arabia==
Slavery was widely practiced in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], as well as in the rest of the ancient and [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] world. The minority were white slaves of foreign extraction, likely brought in by Arab caravaners (or the product of [[Bedouin]] captures) stretching back to biblical times. Native [[Arab]] slaves had also existed, a prime example being [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], later to become Muhammad's adopted son. Arab slaves, however, usually obtained as captives, were generally ransomed off amongst nomad tribes.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; The slave population increased by the custom of [[child abandonment]] (see also [[infanticide]]), and by the kidnapping, or, occasionally, the sale of small children.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Lewis (1992) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; There is no conclusive evidence of the existence of enslavement for debt or the sale of children by their families; the late and rare accounts of such occurrences show them to be abnormal, Brunschvig states&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; (According to Brockopp, debt slavery was persistent.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;) Free persons could sell their offspring, or even themselves, into slavery. Enslavement was also possible as a consequence of committing certain offenses against the law, as in the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Two classes of slave existed: a purchased slave, and a slave born in the master's home. Over the latter the master had complete rights of ownership, though these slaves were unlikely to be sold or disposed of by the master. Female slaves were at times forced into [[prostitution]] for the benefit of their masters, in accordance with Near Eastern customs.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mendelsohn (1949) pp. 54—58
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito"&gt;John L Esposito (1998) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical accounts of the early years of Islam report that "slaves of non-Muslim masters ... suffered brutal punishments. [[Sumayyah bint Khayyat]] is famous as the first martyr of Islam, having been killed with a spear by Abū Jahl when she refused to give up her faith. [[Abu Bakr]] freed [[Bilal ibn Ribah|Bilal]] when his master, Umayya ibn Khalaf, placed a heavy rock on his chest in an attempt to force his conversion."&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;

==Slavery in the Quran==
{{Quran}}
[[File:Bilal.jpg|thumb|[[Bilal ibn Ribah]] (''pictured'', atop the [[Kaaba]]) an Ethiopian former slave, was appointed by Muhammad as the first official [[muezzin]]. He had been emancipated when [[Abu Bakr]] paid his ransom upon Muhammad's instruction. The image depicts an episode in January 630, when he became the first Muslim to proclaim [[adhan]] in [[Mecca]].]]

{{quote|The alms are only for the poor and the needy, and those who collect them, and those whose hearts are to be reconciled, and to free the slaves and the debtors, and for the cause of Allah, and (for) the wayfarer; a duty imposed by Allah. Allah is Knower, Wise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Quran|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=9&amp;verse=60|website=corpus.quran.com|accessdate=6 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113160912/http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=9&amp;verse=60|archive-date=2016-01-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mainstream view is that the Quran accepts the institution of slavery. It may be noted that the word 'abd' (slave) is rarely used, being more commonly replaced by some periphrasis such as ''[[ma malakat aymanukum]]'' ("that which your right hands own"). However the meaning and translation of this term has been disputed. W.G. Clarence-Smith has highlighted the [[Ideas of Ghulam Ahmed Pervez#Islam and Individual Liberty|point of view of Ghulam Ahmed Pervez on this issue]], who argued that the term is used in the past-tense in the Quran, thus signalling only those individuals who were already enslaved at the dawn of Islam. This slight change in tense is significant, as it allowed G.A. Parwez to argue that slavery was never compatible with the commandments of the Quran and is in fact outlawed by Quranic Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=William|title=Islam and the Abolition of Slavery|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195221516|page=198|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=slavery+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=slavery%20quran&amp;f=false|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream view; however, is that the Qur'an recognizes the basic inequality between master and slave and the rights of the former over the latter. The historian Brunschvig states that from a spiritual perspective, "the slave has the same value as the free man, and the same eternity is in store for his soul; in this earthly life, failing emancipation, there remains the fact of his inferior status, to which he must piously resign himself."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|16|71}}, {{Quran-usc|30|28}})&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lewis, the Quran urges kindness to the slave&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|4|36}}, {{Quran-usc|9|60}}, {{Quran-usc|24|58}})&lt;/ref&gt; and recommends their liberation by purchase or manumission. The freeing of slaves is recommended both for the expiation of sins&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|4|92}}, {{Quran-usc|5|92}}, {{Quran-usc|58|3}})&lt;/ref&gt; and as an act of simple benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|2|177}}, {{Quran-usc|24|33}}, {{Quran-usc|90|13}})&lt;/ref&gt; It exhorts masters to allow slaves to earn or purchase their own freedom ([[Mukataba|manumission contracts]])."&lt;ref name="L1"&gt;Lewis 1990, page 6. All Qur'anic citations are his.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves are mentioned in at least twenty-nine verses of the Qur'an, most of these are Medinan and refer to the [[legal status]] of slaves. The legal material on slavery in the Qur'an is largely restricted to manumission and [[Human sexual behavior|sexual relations]].&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; According to Sikainga, the Qur'anic references to slavery as mainly contain "broad and general propositions of an ethical nature rather than specific legal formulations."&lt;ref&gt;Sikainga (2005), p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran accepts the distinction between slave and free as part of the natural order and uses this distinction as an example of God's grace,&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|16|71}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding this discrimination between human beings as in accordance with the divinely established order of things.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EoI&lt;/ref&gt; "The Qur'an, however, does not consider slaves to be mere chattel; their humanity is directly addressed in references to their beliefs,&lt;ref name=q2221425&gt;({{Quran-usc|2|221}}, {{Quran-usc|4|25}})&lt;/ref&gt; their desire for manumission and their feelings about being forced into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|24|33}})&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, the Qur'an refers to master and slave with the same word, ''rajul''. Later interpreters presume slaves to be spiritual equals of free Muslims. For example, verse 4:25&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|4|25}}&lt;/ref&gt; urges believers to marry 'believing maids that your right hands own' and then states: "The one of you is as the other," which the Jalaalayn interpret as "You and they are equal in faith, so do not refrain from marrying them." The human aspect of slaves is further reinforced by reference to them as members of the private household, sometimes along with wives or children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|23|6}}{{Quran-usc|24|58}}{{Quran-usc|33|50}}{{Quran-usc|70|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; The Prophet ordered slave-owners to address their slaves by such euphemistic terms as "my boy" and "my girl" stemmed from the belief that God, not their masters, was responsible for the slave's status.&lt;ref&gt;Marmon in Marmon (1999), page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many common features between the institution of slavery in the Quran and that of neighboring cultures. However, the Quranic institution had some unique new features.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; [[Bernard Lewis]] states that the Qur'anic legislation brought two major changes to ancient slavery which were to have far-reaching effects: presumption of freedom, and the ban on the enslavement of free persons except in strictly defined  circumstances.&lt;ref name="L1"/&gt; According to Brockopp, the idea of using alms for the manumission of slaves appears to be unique to the Quran, assuming the traditional interpretation of verses {{Quran-usc|2|177}} and {{Quran-usc|9|60}}. Similarly, the practice of freeing slaves in atonement for certain sins appears to be introduced by the Quran (but compare Exod 21:26-7).&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; The forced prostitution of female slaves, a Near Eastern custom of great antiquity, is condemned in the Quran.&lt;ref name="Esposito" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|24|33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray Gordon notes that this ban is "of no small significance."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1989, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Brockopp writes: "Other cultures limit a master's right to harm a slave but few exhort masters to treat their slaves kindly, and the placement of slaves in the same category as other weak members of society who deserve protection is unknown outside the Qur'an. The unique contribution of the Qur'an, then, is to be found in its emphasis on the place of slaves in society and society's responsibility toward the slave, perhaps the most progressive legislation on slavery in its time."&lt;ref name="Brockopp"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], ''Slaves and Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maurice Middleberg, "[[Surat al-Balad|Sura 90 in the Quran]] states that the righteous path involves 'the freeing of slaves.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/22/opinions/faiths-unite-end-modern-slavery/index.html|title='All faiths can unite to end modern slavery|last=Middleberg|first=Maurice|date=2016-04-22|work=CNN|access-date=2018-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904052731/https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/22/opinions/faiths-unite-end-modern-slavery/index.html|archive-date=2018-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muhammad's traditions===
The most notable of Muhammad's slaves were: [[Safiyya bint Huyayy]], whom he freed and married; [[Maria al-Qibtiyya]], given to Muhammad by [[Muqawqis|a Sassanid official]], whom he freed and who may have become his wife;&lt;ref&gt;from "Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir" (Book of the Major Classes) by Ibn Sa'd's&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sirin (Islamic history)|Sirin]], Maria's sister, whom he freed and married to the poet [[Hassan ibn Thabit]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lastprophet.info/en/content/view/111/14/1/17/ Aydin, p.17 (citing Ibn Abdilberr, İstîâb, IV, p. 1868; Nawavî, Tahzib al Asma, I, p. 162; Ibn al Asîr, Usd al Ghâbe, VI, p. 160)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721220312/http://www.lastprophet.info/en/content/view/111/14/1/17/ |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], whom Muhammad freed and [[Islamic adoptional jurisprudence|adopted as a son]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (1996), p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic jurisprudence==

===Traditional Islamic jurisprudence===

====Principles====
In [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], slavery was an exceptional condition,{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} with the general rule being a presumption of freedom (''al-'asl huwa 'l-hurriya'' — "''The basic principle is liberty''") for a person if his or her origins were unknown.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} Lawful enslavement was restricted to two instances: capture in war (on the condition that the prisoner is not a Muslim), or birth in slavery. Islamic law did not recognize the classes of slave from [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] including those sold or given into slavery by themselves and others, and those indebted into slavery.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; Though a free Muslim could not be enslaved, [[Religious conversion|conversion to Islam]] by a non-Muslim slave did not require that he or she then should be liberated. Slave status was not affected by conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
In the instance of illness it would be required for the slave to be looked after. [[Manumission]] is considered a meritorious act. Based on the Quranic verse (24:33), Islamic law permits a slave to ransom himself upon consent of his master through a contract known as ''[[mukataba]]''.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]], a professor of Law specializing in Islamic jurisprudence, states that both the Qur'an and Hadith are repeatedly exhorting Muslims to treat the slaves well and that Muhammad showed this both in action and in words.&lt;ref name="Hibri"&gt;Azizah Y. al-Hibri, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Levy concurs, adding that "cruelty to them was forbidden."&lt;ref name="L77"&gt;Levy (1957) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hibri quotes the famous last speech of Muhammad and other hadiths emphasizing that all believers, whether free or enslaved, are siblings.&lt;ref name="Hibri"/&gt; Lewis explains, "the humanitarian tendency of the Qur'an and the early caliphs in the Islamic empire, was to some extent counteracted by other influences,"&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; notably the practice of various conquered people and countries Muslims encountered, especially in provinces previously under [[Roman law]]. In spite of this, Lewis also states, "Islamic practice still represented a vast improvement on that inherited from antiquity, from Rome, and from Byzantium."&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; Murray Gordon writes: "It was not surprising that Muhammad, who accepted the existing socio-political order, looked upon slavery as part of the natural order of things. His approach to what was already an age-old institution was reformist and not revolutionary. The Prophet had not in mind to bring about the abolition of slavery. Rather, his purpose was to improve the conditions of slaves by correcting abuses and appealing to the conscience of his followers to treat them humanely."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1987, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of slaves as members of the family was common, according to Levy. If a slave was born and brought up in the master's household he was never sold, except in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name="L77"/&gt;

====Sexual intercourse====
{{See also|Ma malakat aymanukum and sex}}
In Islamic law ([[Sharia]]), ''[[Ma malakat aymanukum]]'' is the term for slaves or captives of war. The purchase of female slaves for sex was lawful from the perspective of Islamic law, and this was the most common motive for the purchase of slaves throughout Islamic history.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Muminun]] 6 and [[Al-Maarij]] 30 both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and "those whom one's right hands possess", saying " أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ" (literally, "their spouses or what their right hands possess"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible.  Sayyid [[Abul Ala Maududi]] explains that "two categories of women have been excluded from the general command of guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in one's possession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?pagetitle=AL+-+MUMINOON&amp;sno=23&amp;tno=1324|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070311085024/http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?pagetitle=AL+-+MUMINOON&amp;sno=23&amp;tno=1324|deadurl=yes|title=Surah - AL - MUMINOON|date=11 March 2007|archivedate=11 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concubinage====
{{Slavery}}
{{see also|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}
Slave women were required mainly as concubines and menials. A Muslim slaveholder was entitled by law to the sexual enjoyment of his slave women. While free women might own male slaves, they had no such right.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The property of a slave was owned by his or her master unless a contract of freedom of the slave had been entered into, which allowed the slave to earn money to purchase his or her freedom and similarly to pay bride wealth. The marriage of slaves required the consent of the owner. Under the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools of jurisprudence male slaves could marry two wives, but the Maliki permitted them to marry four wives like the free men. According to the Islamic law, a male slave could marry a free woman but this was discouraged in practice.&lt;ref name="Sikainga"/&gt; Islam permits sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside marriage. This is referred to in the Qur'an as ''[[ma malakat aymanukum]]'' or "what your right hands possess".&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tahfeem ul Qur'an]] by [[Maududi|Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]], Vol. 2 pp. 112-113 footnote 44; Also see commentary on verses {{Quran-usc-range|23|1|6}}: Vol. 3, notes 7-1, p. 241; 2000, Islamic Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tafsir ibn Kathir]] 4:24&lt;/ref&gt; There are some restrictions on the master; he may not co-habit with a female slave belonging to his wife, neither can he have relations with a female slave if she is co-owned, or already married.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

In ancient Arabian custom, the child of a freeman by his slave was also a slave unless he was recognized and liberated by his father.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the recognition by a master of his offspring by a slave woman was optional in Islamic society, and in the early period was often withheld. By the [[High Middle Ages]] it became normal and was unremarkable in a society where the sovereigns themselves were almost invariably the children of slave concubines.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The mother receives the title of "umm walad" (''lit''. mother of a child)&lt;ref name="umm walad"&gt;''[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2424] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801050417/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2424 |date=2017-08-01 }}'' Umm al-Walad, "Mother of the son. Refers to a slave woman impregnated by her owner…", Oxford Islamic Studies Online&lt;/ref&gt;, which is an improvement in her status as she can no longer be sold. Among Sunnis, she is automatically freed upon her master's death, however for Shi'a, she is only freed if her child is still alive; her value is then deducted from this child's share of the inheritance.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; Lovejoy writes that as an ''umm walad'', they attained "an intermediate position between slave and free" pending their freedom, although they would sometimes be nominally freed as soon as they gave birth.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;

There is no limit on the number of concubines a master may possess. However, the general marital laws are to be observed, such as not having sexual relations with the sister of a female slave.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt; In Islam, "men are enjoined to marry free women in the first instance, but if they cannot afford the bridewealth for free women, they are told to marry slave women rather than engage in wrongful acts."&lt;ref&gt;Nashat (1999) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; One rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that "it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sikainga(1996), p.22&lt;/ref&gt; A slave master could have sex with his female slave only while she was not married. This attempt to require sexual exclusivity for female slaves was rare in antiquity, when female slaves generally had no claim to an exclusive sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Kecia  |last=Ali  | authorlink = Kecia Ali | year=2010 | title=Marriage and Slavery in Early Islam |publisher=Harvard University Press|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C229nbjq8TMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sikainga, "in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for members of their owners' household, their neighbors, and their guests."&lt;ref&gt;Sikainga (1996) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shiite jurisprudence it is unlawful for a master of a female slave to grant a third party the use of her for sexual relations.  The Shiite scholar Shaykh al-Tusi stated:ولا يجوز إعارتها للاستمتاع بها لأن البضع لا يستباح بالإعارة
"It is not permissible to loan (the slave girl) for enjoyment purpose, because sexual intercourse cannot be legitimate through loaning"&lt;ref&gt;
Shaykh al-Tusi stated in Al-Mabsut, Volume 3 page 57&lt;/ref&gt; and the Shiite scholars al-Muhaqiq al-Kurki, Allamah al-Hilli and Ali Asghar Merwarid made the following ruling: ولا تجوز استعارة الجواري للاستمتاع
"It is not permissible to loan the slave girl for the purpose of sexual intercourse"&lt;ref&gt;al-Muhaqiq al-Kurki in ''Jame'a al-Maqasid'', Volume 6 page 62, Allamah al-Hilli in ''Al-Tadkira'', Volume 2 page 210 and Ali Asghar Merwarid in ''Al-Yanabi al-Fiqhya'', Volume 17 page 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[legal doctrine]] of ''kafa'a''(lit."efficiency"), the purpose of which was to ensure that a man should be at least the social equal of the woman he marries, a freedman is not as good as the son of a freedman, and he in turn not as good as the grandson of a freedman. This principle is pursued up to three generations, after which all Muslims are deemed equally free.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 85&amp;ndash;86&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis asserts that since kafa'a "does not forbid unequal marriages", it is in no sense a "Muslim equivalent of [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nuremberg Laws]] of [[Nazi Germany]] or the apartheid laws of [[South Africa]]. His purpose, he states, is not to try to set up a moral competition - to compare castration and apartheid as offenses against humanity."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Joseph, Review of ''Race and Color in Islam'' by [[Bernard Lewis]], ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'', Vol. 5, No. 3. (Jun., 1974), pp. 368-371.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal status====
Within [[Islamic jurisprudence]], slaves were excluded from religious office and from any office involving jurisdiction over others.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Freed slaves are able to occupy any office within the [[Caliphate|Islamic government]], and instances of this in history include the [[Mamluk]] who ruled Egypt for almost 260 years and the [[eunuch]]s who have held military and administrative positions of note.&lt;ref name="schimmel"&gt;Schimmel (1992) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; With the permission of their owners they are able to marry.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002) p.148&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annemarie Schimmel]], a contemporary scholar on [[Muslim world|Islamic civilization]], asserts that because the status of slaves under Islam could only be obtained through either being a [[prisoner of war]] (this was soon restricted only to infidels captured in a [[jihad|holy war]])&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; or born from slave parents, slavery would be theoretically abolished with the expansion of Islam.&lt;ref name="schimmel" /&gt; [[Fazlur Rahman]] agrees, stating that the Qur'anic acceptance of the institution of slavery on the legal plane was the only practical option available at the time of Muhammad since "slavery was ingrained in the structure of society, and its overnight wholesale liquidation would have created problems which it would have been absolutely impossible to solve, and only a dreamer could have issued such a visionary statement."&lt;ref&gt;Fazlur Rahman, Islam, University of Chicago Press, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Islam's reforms stipulating the conditions of enslavement seriously limited the supply of new slaves.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; Murray Gordon does note: "Muhammad took pains in urging the faithful to free their slaves as a way of expiating their sins. Some [[List of Muslim scholars|Muslim scholars]] have taken this mean that his true motive was to bring about a gradual elimination of slavery. An alternative argument is that by lending the [[moral authority]] of Islam to slavery, Muhammad assured its legitimacy. Thus, in lightening the fetter, he riveted it ever more firmly in place."&lt;ref&gt;Murray Gordon, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=5l81hwFPvzYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Slavery in the Arab World]." New Amsterdam Press, New York, 1989. Originally published in French by Editions Robert Laffont, S.A. Paris, 1987. Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of Islam, a plentiful supply of new slaves were brought due to rapid conquest and expansion. But as the frontiers were gradually stabilized, this supply dwindled to a mere trickle. The prisoners of later wars between Muslims and Christians were commonly ransomed or exchanged.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

According to Lewis, this reduction resulted in Arabs who wanted slaves having to look elsewhere to avoid the restrictions in the Qur'an, meaning an increase of importing of slaves from non-Muslim lands,&lt;ref name="L9010"&gt;Lewis (1990) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; primarily from Africa. These slaves suffered a high death toll.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="L9010"/&gt; [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]] states that Islamic legislations against the abuse of the slaves convincingly limited the extent of enslavement in [[Arabian Peninsula]] and to a lesser degree for the whole area of the whole [[Umayyad|Umayyad Caliphate]] where slavery had existed since the most ancient times. He however notes that with the passage of time and the extension of Islam, Islam by recognizing and codifying slavery seems to have done more to protect and expand slavery than the reverse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Manning (1990) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory free-born Muslims could not be enslaved, and the only way that a non-Muslim could be enslaved was being captured in the course of holy war.&lt;ref name="Sikainga"&gt;Sikainga (1996) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; (In early Islam, neither a Muslim nor a Christian or Jew could be enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;John Esposito (1998) p.40&lt;/ref&gt;) Slavery was also perceived as a means of converting non-Muslims to Islam: A task of the masters was religious instruction. Conversion and assimilation into the society of the master didn't automatically lead to emancipation, though there was normally some guarantee of better treatment and was deemed a prerequisite for emancipation.&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;Paul Lovejoy (2000) p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of [[Sunni]] authorities approved the [[manumission]] of all the "[[People of the Book]]". According to some jurists -especially among the [[Shi'a]]- only Muslim slaves should be liberated.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis(1990) 106&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, traditional propagators of [[Islam in Africa]] often revealed a cautious attitude towards proselytizing because of its effect in reducing the potential reservoir of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Gordon, "Slavery in the [[Arab world|Arab World]]." [[New Amsterdam]] Press, New York, 1989. Originally published in French by Editions Robert Laffont, S.A. Paris, 1987, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Rights and restrictions=====
"Morally as well as physically the slave is regarded in law as an inferior being," Levy writes.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; Under Islamic law, a slave possesses a composite quality of being both a person and a possession.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; The slave is entitled to receive sustenance from the master, which includes shelter, food, clothing, and medical attention. It is a requirement for this sustenance to be of the same standard generally found in the locality and it is also recommended for the slave to have the same standard of food and clothing as the master. If the master refuses to provide the required sustenance, the slave may complain to a judge, who may then penalize the master through sale of her or his goods as necessary for the slave's keep. If the master does not have sufficient wealth to facilitate this, she or he must either sell, hire out, or manumit the slave as ordered. Slaves also have the right to a period of rest during the hottest parts of the day during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Khalil b. Ishaq, quoted in Levy (1957) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence from slaves is rarely viable in a court of law. As slaves are regarded as inferior in Islamic law, death at the hands of a free man does not require that the latter be killed in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Except according to Hanafis, who make a free man liable to retaliation in cases of murder&lt;/ref&gt; The killer must pay the slave's master compensation equivalent to the slave's value, as opposed to blood-money. At the same time, slaves themselves possess a lessened responsibility for their actions, and receive half the penalty required upon a free man. For example: where a free man would be subject to a hundred lashes due to pre-marital relations, a slave would be subject to only fifty. Slaves are allowed to marry only with the owner's consent. Jurists differ over how many wives a slave may possess, with the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools allowing them two, and the Maliki school allowing four. Slaves are not permitted to possess or inherit property, or conduct independent business, and may conduct financial dealings only as a representative of the master. Offices of authority are generally not permitted for slaves, though a slave may act as the leader (''[[Imam]]'') in the congregational [[salat|prayers]], and he may also act as a subordinate officer in the governmental department of revenue.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy (1957) pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; Masters may sell, bequeath, give away, pledge, hire out or compel them to earn money.&lt;ref name="L77" /&gt;

By the view of some [[madh'hab]] (but not others), a master may compel his/her slave(s) to marriage and determine the identity of their marriage partner(s)&lt;ref&gt;Khalil bin Ishaq, II, 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sachau, p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mahr]] that is given for marriage to a female slave is taken by her owner, whereas all other women possess it absolutely for themselves&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manumission====
The Qur'an and Hadith, the primary Islamic texts, make it a praiseworthy act for masters to [[manumission|set their slaves free]]. There are numerous ways in which a slave may become free. One way is through expiation for certain sins committed by the master, such as involuntary [[manslaughter]] or [[perjury]]. Other ways include emancipation through becoming an ''umm walad''&lt;ref name="umm walad" /&gt;, who is freed upon her master's death along with her children, or an independent act of piety by the master, as recommended by the Quran. It is also commendable to manumit a slave who demands his freedom and is considered worthy of it; however, [[Richard Francis Burton]] states in a footnote to the "Tale of the Second Eunuch", commenting on the proposed emancipation of a slave without employable skills, that "Here the slave refuses to be set free and starve. For a master so to do without ample reasons is held disgraceful. I well remember the weeping and wailing throughout Sind when an order from Sir Charles Napier set free the negroes whom British philanthropy thus doomed to endure if not to die of hunger."&lt;ref name="RFBurton"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method is the ''[[mukataba]]'' contract: Levy states that "the slave may redeem himself if his master agrees and contracts to let him go on payment of a stipulated sum of money, which may be paid in two or more instalments, or on the giving of stipulated services or other consideration. If the consideration is a sum of money, the master must grant the slave the right to earn and to own property."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L8081"&gt;Levy pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

If the master makes a declaration of the slave's freedom, whether in jest or earnest, in the presence of the slave or another, then such a declaration becomes legally binding. Similarly, the master may promise manumission (verbally or in writing) that the slave is to be freed upon the former's death. Lastly, a slave is also freed automatically if she or he comes into the possession of a master who is directly related to her or him.&lt;ref name="L8081"/&gt;

Gordon opines that the Quran in particular and Islamic jurisprudence in general have not placed a premium on manumission but held it out as one way for atonement of sin. He states that "Manumission was only one of several virtuous observances that the pious could avail themselves of and was by no means the most important,"&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Gordon 1987, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; noting that other options include reaffirming faith in God and giving food to the poor. He concludes that "there was no contradiction between being a devout Muslim and a slave-owing one as well."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1987, pages 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern interpretations==
=== Abolitionism ===
The abolition movement starting in the 19th century in England&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/antislavery_01.shtml|title=British Anti-slavery|last=Oldfield|first=John|date=2011-02-07|website=British History in depth|publisher=BBC History|access-date=2016-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925213603/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/antislavery_01.shtml|archive-date=2016-09-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in other Western countries influenced the slavery in Muslim lands both in doctrine and in practice.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; One of the first religious decrees comes from the two highest dignitaries of the Hanafi and Maliki rites in the Ottoman Empire. These religious authorities declared that slavery is lawful in principle but it is regrettable in its consequences. They expressed two religious considerations in their support for abolition of slavery: "the initial enslaving of the people concerned comes under suspicion of illegality by reason of the present-day expansion of Islam in their countries; masters no longer comply with the rules of good treatment which regulate their rights and shelter them from wrong-doing."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

According to Brunschvig, although the total abolition of slavery might seem a reprehensible innovation and contrary to the Qur'an and the practice of early Muslims, the realities of the modern world caused a "discernible evolution in the thought of many educated Muslims before the end of the 19th century."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; These Muslims argued that Islam on the whole has "bestowed an exceptionally favourable lot on the victims of slavery" and that the  institution of slavery is linked to the particular economic and social stage in which Islam originated. According to the influential thesis of [[Syed Ameer Ali|Ameer Ali]], Islam only tolerated slavery through temporary necessity and that its complete abolition was not possible at the time of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

According to  Brockopp, some modern interpreters have accused the medieval interpreters of having subverted the Qur'an's demand for manumission contracts (see [[Mukataba]]). They have used the dramatic change in the institution of slavery in the 7th and 8th centuries to argue that the Qur'an would not have condoned the slaving practices common in Islamic history. Others{{who|date=June 2017}} have argued that the original intent of the Qur'an, when understood properly, was to abolish slavery altogether.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

The idea that Islam only tolerated slavery due to necessity has to some extent found its way into the circle of the [[Ulema]].&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; It has been unable to gain support among the [[Wahhabi]]s.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

===Islamist opinions===
[[File:Sayyid Qutb.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sayyid Qutb]]]]

Earlier in the 20th century, prior to the "reopening" of slavery by [[Salafi]] scholars like Shaykh al-Fawzan, Islamist authors declared slavery outdated without actually clearly affirming and promoting its abolition. This has caused at least one scholar (William Clarence-Smith&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staffinfo.cfm?contactid=36] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417083811/http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staffinfo.cfm?contactid=36 |date=April 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to bemoan the "dogged refusal of [[Abul A'la Maududi|Mawlana Mawdudi]] to give up on slavery"&lt;ref name=CS-maududi&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=W.

[[Sayyid Qutb]], the scholar of the Islamist [[Muslim Brotherhood]] said in his exegesis (''[[Tafsir]]'') of the Quran:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And concerning slavery, that was when slavery was a world-wide structure and which was conducted amongst Muslims and their enemies in the form of enslaving of prisoners of war. And it was necessary for Islam to adopt a similar line of practise until the world devised a new code of practise during war other than enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;in [[Fi Zilal al-Qur'an]], Surah Tawbah (3/1669) also in Tafsir of Surah Baqarah (/230), tafsir of Surah Mu'minoon (4/2455), tafsir of Surah Muhammad (6/3285)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Qutb's brother [[Muhammad Qutb]] contrasted sexual relations between Muslim slave-owners and their female slaves with (in his view), the widespread and depraved practice of casual consensual sex in contemporary Europe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Islam made it lawful for a master to have a number of slave-women captured in wars and enjoined that he alone may have sexual relations with them ... Europe abhors this law but at the same gladly allows that most odious form of animalism according to which a man may have illicit relations with any girl coming across him on his way to gratify his animal passions.&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, Muhammad, ''Islam, the Misunderstood Religion'', Markazi Maktabi Islami, Delhi-6, 1992 p.50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Abul A'la Maududi]] of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] has said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Islam has clearly and categorically forbidden the primitive practice of capturing a free man, to make him a slave or to sell him into slavery. On this point the clear and unequivocal words of [[Muhammad]] are as follows:&lt;blockquote style="font-size:inherit; quotes:none"&gt;"There are three categories of people against whom I shall myself be a plaintiff on the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgement]]. Of these three, one is he who enslaves a free man, then sells him and eats this money" (al-Bukhari and Ibn Majjah).&lt;/blockquote&gt; The words of this Tradition of the Prophet are also general, they have not been qualified or made applicable to a particular nation, race, country or followers of a particular religion.&amp;nbsp;... After this the only form of slavery which was left in Islamic society was the prisoners of war, who were captured on the battlefield. These prisoners of war were retained by the Muslim Government until their government agreed to receive them back in exchange for Muslim soldiers captured by them&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;From "Human Rights in Islam" by 'Allamah Abu Al-'A'la Mawdudi. Chapter 3, subsection 5 [http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/slav3.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203193405/http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/slav3.htm |date=2007-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Taqiuddin Al Nabhani.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]].]]
[[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]], a shariah judge and founder of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] movement, gives the following explanation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When Islam came, for the situations where people were taken into slavery (e.g. debt), Islam imposed Shari’ah solutions to those situations other than slavery. ... It (Islam) made the existing slave and owner form a business contract, based upon the freedom, not upon slavery ...  As for the situation of war, ...  it clarified the rule of the captive in that either they are favoured by releasing without any exchange, or they are ransomed for money or exchanged for Muslims or non-Muslim citizens of the [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;''al-Shakhsiyah al-Islamiyyah'' (The Islamic Personality) by [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]], Volume 3, Slavery Section&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The website of the organization stresses that because sharia historically was responding to a contract, not the institution of slavery, a future Khilafah could not re-introduce slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khilafah.com/index.php/the-khilafah/foreign-policy/2764-the-islamic-view-on-slaves-and-slavery "The Islamic view on Slaves and Slavery"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111114656/http://www.khilafah.com/index.php/the-khilafah/foreign-policy/2764-the-islamic-view-on-slaves-and-slavery |date=2010-11-11 }}, khilafah.com 13 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salafi support for slavery===

In recent years, according to some scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Abou El Fadl and William Clarence-Smith&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a "reopening"&lt;ref&gt;Abou el Fadl, ''Great Theft'', HarperSanFrancisco, c2005. p.255&lt;/ref&gt; of the issue of slavery by some conservative [[Salafi]] Islamic scholars after its "closing" earlier in the 20th century when [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim countries]] banned slavery and "most Muslim scholars" found the practice "inconsistent with Qur'anic morality."&lt;ref&gt;Abou el Fadl, ''Great Theft'', HarperSanFrancisco, c2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/Research/GEHN/GEHNPDF/Conf3_WCSmith.pdf|title=Department of Economic History|first=London School of Economics and Political|last=Science|publisher=|access-date=2015-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603012804/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/Research/GEHN/GEHNPDF/Conf3_WCSmith.pdf|archive-date=2016-06-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial high-level Saudi jurist, Shaykh [[Saleh Al-Fawzan]], said in a lecture, "Slavery is a part of Islam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6305">In 2001–2002 several [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Wisconsin State Assembly|state representatives]] in [[Wisconsin]] objected to the hiring of Jamyi Witch, a [[Wicca]]n, as a prison chaplain.&lt;ref name="LAtimes"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jan/07/news/mn-20925 Simon, Stephanie. "Wiccan Chaplain Brews Storm: Religion: Some taxpayers want the Rev. Jamyi Witch removed from her state job counseling prisoners." ''Los Angeles Times'' January 7, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The objection to the hiring was led by [[Michael Huebsch]] and later joined by [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] who was then a state representative.&lt;ref name="LAtimes" /&gt;

==Genesis of issue==
In December 2001, Mike Huebsch began leading efforts to block the funding for Witch's $32,500-a-year position. He stated taxpayers "shouldn't be forced to accept this hocus-pocus."&lt;ref name="LAtimes"/&gt; The legislators had learned that [[Wisconsin Department of Corrections]] had recently hired Rev. Jamyi Witch as a [[prison]] [[chaplain]] at the [[Waupun Correctional Institution]] in [[Waupun, Wisconsin]]. Witch, who had volunteered for two years as a chaplain and had an extensive knowledge of alternative religions, had competed against nine other candidates for the civil service position and was hired as the most qualified candidate for the $32,500 per year job.&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes"&gt;Toosi, Nahal, "[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20011209&amp;slug=witch09 Wiccan Rev. Witch raises some brows at Wisconsin prison]", ''[[Seattle Times]]'', December 9, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chaplain was a practicing Wiccan and had, in fact, changed her last name to Witch in honor of her chosen religion.&lt;ref name="LAtimes" /&gt;

==Hiring controversy==
Huebsch and Walker objected publicly on the basis of her religion to the chaplain’s hiring,&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes" /&gt; saying: "Witch's hiring raises both personal and political concerns. Not only does she practice a different religion than most of the inmates – she practices a religion that actually offends people of many other faiths, including Christians, Muslims and Jews."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Wiccan+prison+chaplain+sparks+controversy+in+Wisconsin.+(Around+The...-a083794867 "Around the World: Wiccan prison chaplain sparks controversy in Wisconsin" ''Church &amp; State'' February 1, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huebsch and Walker threatened to launch a government investigation of the chaplain’s hiring,&lt;ref name="LAtimes" /&gt;  "Taxpayers shouldn't be forced to accept this hocus-pocus," Huebsch stated. Huebsch proposed to delete the state appropriation which funded Witch's position, even though in the past he had repeatedly advocated increasing state funding for prison chaplains.&lt;ref name="LAtimes" /&gt;

After several weeks of unwanted publicity, the chaplain began to receive calls and messages including a handful of death threats and reported that on one day alone she had received 432 emails and 76 phone messages at her home. She said the majority of the messages were strongly supportive.&lt;ref name="LAtimes" /&gt;

==Conclusion==
Walker and Huebsch, who had said they would draft legislation to prevent similar hirings by the state of Wisconsin, were ultimately unsuccessful in their efforts to terminate the employment of Witch, who was represented by the Wisconsin State Employees Union, founding body of the [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.org/media/church-and-state/archives/2002/02/aub.html "Wiccan prison chaplain sparks controversy in Wisconsin," ''Americans United Bulletin'', February 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512184102/http://www.au.org/media/church-and-state/archives/2002/02/aub.html |date=2009-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Witch and the prison's only [[Islam|Muslim]] chaplain were subsequently excluded from the longstanding Waupun Clergy Association, which declared that it was open only to Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Kottke, Colleen.

In 2011, Witch was taken hostage by an inmate who barricaded himself in her office.

'''Jebel Dosha''' is a sandstone promontory right beside the [[Nile]], on the western river bank between [[Soleb]] and [[Sedeinga]] in [[Northern, Sudan|Northern State]] in [[Sudan]]. It features a [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] chapel of [[Thutmose III]], similar to the contemporary [[Temple of Ellesyia]] as well as several [[stelae]] and rock inscriptions of [[New Kingdom]] date.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Green; ‘Creating a Virtual Reconstruction of the Seti I Inscription at Jebel Dosha’; Sudan &amp; Nubia 17 – 2013; pp. 18-23. &lt;/ref&gt;

==The chapel==
The rock-cut chapel, which overlooks the Nile, contains partly lost inscriptions and wall-decoration of Thutmose III. In the back wall of the chapel there are three largely disfigured seated statues.

==Rock inscriptions and  stelae==
[[File:JebelDosha2.jpg|thumb|left|Sunk relief with Amenemopet, offering to a Lunar God and to Satet]]
In the early [[Ramesside]] period several stelae, mostly commissioned by the [[Viceroy of Kush]] [[Amenemopet (Viceroy of Kush)|Amenemopet]], were added. One of the stelae shows [[Seti I]] making an offering to the gods [[Khnum]], [[Satet]] and [[Anket]]; another, done in [[sunk relief]], shows a kneeling Amenemopet offering to a lunar god and to the goddess Satet.
Several groups of striding figures are carved into the jebel rock.&lt;ref&gt;William Vivian Davies; The Egyptian Inscriptions at Jebel Dosha, Sudan.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Journey to Ixtlan''''' is the third book by [[Carlos Castaneda]], published as a work of non-fiction by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Castaneda, Carlos. ''Journey to Ixtlan.'' New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; It is about an alleged apprenticeship to the Yaqui "shaman," Don Juan.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei A. Znamenski, "General Introduction: Adventures of the Metaphor: shamanism and shamanism studies," Shamanism: Critical Concepts in Sociology, ed. Andrei A. Znamenski, (London: RoutledgeCurzon, 2004), xlv-xlvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of this book is taken from an allegory that is recounted to Castaneda by his "benefactor" who is known to Carlos as Don Genaro ( Genaro Flores ), a close friend of his teacher [[don Juan Matus]]. "Ixtlan" turns out to be a metaphorical hometown ( or Place / Position of Being ) to which the "sorcerer" or warrior or man of knowledge is drawn to return, trying to get home. After the work of "stopping", his changed perspective leaves him little in common with ordinary people, who now seem no more substantial to him than "phantoms." The point of the story is that a man of knowledge, or sorcerer, is a changed being, or a Human closer to his true state of Being, and for that reason he can never truly go "home" to his old lifestyle again.

In ''Journey to Ixtlan'' Castaneda essentially reevaluates the teachings up to that point.  He discusses information that was apparently missing from the first two books regarding stopping the world which previously he had only regarded as a metaphor.

He also finds that [[psychotropic plant]]s, knowledge of which was a significant part of his [[apprenticeship]] to [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] [[shaman]] don Juan Matus, are not as important in the world view as he had previously thought. In the introduction he writes:

{{quote|My basic assumption in both books has been that the articulation points in learning to be a sorcerer were the states of nonordinary reality produced by the ingestion of psychotropic plants ... 

My perception of the world through the effects of those psychotropics had been so bizarre and impressive that I was forced to assume that such states were the only avenue to communicating and learning what Don Juan was attempting to teach me.

That assumption was erroneous.}}

In the book don Juan takes Carlos on these various degrees of [[apprenticeship]], in response to what he believes are signals from the phenomenological world, "The decision as to who can be a warrior and who can only be a hunter is not up to us.  That decision is in the realm of the powers that guide men."&lt;ref&gt;''Journey to Ixtlan'', p107&lt;/ref&gt;

The book shows a progression between different states of learning, from [[hunter]], to [[warrior]], to man of knowledge or [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]], the difference said to be one of skill level and the type of thing hunted, "... a warrior is an impeccable hunter that hunts power.  If he succeeds in his hunting he becomes a man of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;''Journey to Ixtlan'', p123&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the book Castaneda portrays himself as skeptical and reserved in his explanations of the phenomena at hand, but by the end of the book Castaneda's rationalist worldview is seen to be breaking down in the face of an onslaught of experiences that he is unable to explain logically.

'''Mary Sue Hubbard''' (née '''Whipp'''; June 17, 1931 – November 25, 2002&lt;ref name="mshubbardwebsite"&gt;[http://marysuehubbard.com/deathcert.shtml Profile], marysuehubbard.com; accessed April 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;) was the third wife of [[L. Ron Hubbard]], from 1952 until his death in 1986. She was a leading figure in  [[Scientology]] for much of her life. The Hubbards had four children; Diana (born 1952), [[Quentin Hubbard|Quentin]] (born 1954), Suzette (born 1955), and Arthur (born 1958).

She became involved in Hubbard's [[Dianetics]] in 1952, while still a student at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], becoming a Dianetics [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditor]]. She soon became involved in a relationship with Hubbard and married him in March 1952. She accompanied her husband to [[Phoenix, Arizona]], where they established the [[Hubbard Association of Scientologists]] – the forerunner of the [[Church of Scientology]], which was itself founded in 1953. She was credited with helping to coin the word "Scientology". She played a leading role in the management of the Church of Scientology, rising to become the head of the Church's [[Guardian's Office]] (GO). In August 1978, she was indicted by the [[United States government]] on charges of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] relating to illegal covert operations mounted by the Guardian's Office against government agencies. She was convicted in December 1979 and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and the payment of a $10,000 fine. She was forced to resign her post in July 1981 and served a year in prison from January 1983, after exhausting her appeals against her conviction. In the late 1990s, she fell ill with [[breast cancer]] and died in 2002.&lt;ref name="mshubbardwebsite"/&gt;

==Early life and involvement in Dianetics==
Mary Sue Whipp was born in [[Rockdale, Texas]], to Harry and Mary Catherine (née Hill) Whipp.&lt;ref name="death certificate"&gt;{{cite book|title=Certificate of Death 3-052002-226587|publisher=State of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in [[Houston]], where she attended [[Rice University]] for a year before moving on to the [[University of Texas at Austin]], from which she graduated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]].&lt;ref name="Auditor21"&gt;[[#Auditor21|''The Auditor'', issue 21]].&lt;/ref&gt; She originally intended to work in petroleum research, but a friend persuaded her to travel with him to [[Wichita, Kansas]], in mid-1951 to take a Dianetics course at the Hubbard Dianetic Foundation. She soon began an affair with Hubbard, who had just been divorced from his second wife [[Sara Northrup Hollister|Sara]], and moved in with him within only a few weeks of arriving in Wichita. She obtained a Hubbard Dianetic Auditor's Certificate and joined the Foundation's staff.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

She became pregnant in February 1952 and married Hubbard the next month. By this time the Foundation had filed for bankruptcy, and Hubbard's erstwhile backer, Don Purcell, was left to deal with its substantial debts. A bitter dispute broke out between the men over the ownership of the Foundation's remaining assets, with Hubbard resigning to start a rival "Hubbard College" on the other side of Wichita. Mary Sue was given partial responsibility for running the new Dianetics establishment. After six weeks of operation&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; it was replaced in April 1952 by the Hubbard Association of Scientologists, established in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] to promote Hubbard's newly announced "science of certainty". {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==The establishment and expansion of Scientology==
The Hubbards traveled to England in September 1952 when Mary Sue was eight months pregnant. According to the Church of Scientology, the reason for the trip was that "amid the constant violence of the turncoat Don J. Purcell of [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] and his suits which attempted to seize Scientology, Mary Sue became ill and to save her life, Ron took her to [[England]] where several Dianetic groups had asked him to form an organization."&lt;ref name="Auditor21"/&gt; [[Russell Miller]] gives a different explanation: "Hubbard wanted to go to London to establish his control over the small Dianetics group which had formed there spontaneously and Mary Sue insisted on accompanying him."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, on September 24, 1952, she gave birth to her first child, Diana Meredith de Wolfe Hubbard. The Hubbards returned to the United States in November when their visa expired and moved into an apartment in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

They went back to London in December on a fresh visa and stayed there until the end of May 1953, before departing for an extended holiday in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1953 they  returned to the US where Hubbard gave a series of lectures in [[Camden, New Jersey]] and established the first Church of Scientology. By this time, Mary Sue was well advanced with her second pregnancy and remained largely confined to a rented house at [[Medford Lakes, New Jersey]]. They traveled to Phoenix for Christmas 1953 and it was there on January 6, 1954 that Mary Sue gave birth to her second child, [[Quentin Hubbard|Geoffrey Quentin McCaully Hubbard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hubbards lived at a house on Tatum Boulevard (now 5501 North 44th Street)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pela|first=Robert L.|title=Will the L.  Ron Hubbard House Turn a Camelback Neighborhood Into a Scientology Recruitment Mecca?|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2009-02-05/news/will-the-l-ron-hubbard-house-turn-a-camelback-neighborhood-into-a-scientology-recruitment-mecca/|date=2009-02-09|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the slopes of [[Camelback Mountain]] in Phoenix for the remainder of 1954. By this time, Mary Sue had become a key figure within the nascent Scientology movement. Although Hubbard himself was much admired by Scientologists, his wife was said to be much less popular. Russell Miller notes:

{{quote|They were indeed an unlikely couple – a flamboyant, fast-talking extrovert entrepreneur in his forties and a quiet, intense young woman twenty years his junior from a small town in Texas. But anyone who underestimated Mary Sue made a big mistake. Although she was not yet twenty-four years old, she exercised considerable power within the Scientology movement and people around Hubbard quickly learned to be wary of her. Fiercely loyal to her husband, brusque and autocratic, she could be a dangerous enemy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A family friend, Ray Kemp, later recalled: "their relationship seemed OK, but there never seemed to be a lot of love between them. She was not the affectionate type, she was more efficient than affectionate. They used to have fierce husband and wife domestic arguments."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Vidal, a friend of the sculptor Edward Harris, who was commissioned by Hubbard to create a bust of him, described Mary Sue as "a rather drab, mousy, nothing sort of person, quite a bit younger than him."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Urquhart, who worked for the Hubbards as their butler in the 1960s, commented that Mary Sue "could be very sweet and loving, but also very cold."&lt;ref name="Miller250-251"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 250-251.&lt;/ref&gt; Cyril Vosper, one of the Saint Hill staff at the time, noted the differing impressions left by the Hubbards: "I always had great warmth and admiration for Ron – he was a remarkable individual, a constant source of new information and ideas – but I thought Mary Sue was an exceedingly nasty person. She was a bitch."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:L. Ron Hubbard House - Dupont Circle.JPG|thumb|1812 19th Street, [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest]], [[Washington, D.C.]], where L. Ron and Mary Sue Hubbard lived and worked in the late 1950s. The building, now known as the [[L. Ron Hubbard House]], operates as a [[historic house museum]] in [[Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.|Dupont Circle]].]]
Mary Sue became pregnant again four months after Quentin's birth and on February 13, 1955, in [[Washington, D.C.]], she gave birth to her second daughter, Mary Suzette Rochelle Hubbard. Following the birth, the Hubbards moved into a house in [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], Maryland. A "Founding Church of Scientology" was established in Washington, D.C. and Mary Sue became its first Academy Supervisor.&lt;ref name="Auditor21" /&gt;

The Hubbards returned again to London at the end of September 1955, where they took over the day-to-day management of the Hubbard Association of Scientologists International.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; They remained there until 1957, when Hubbard returned to lecture at the Academy of Scientology in Washington, D.C., with Mary Sue and the children following later. By this time Mary Sue was pregnant for a fourth time and gave birth to her final child, Arthur Ronald Conway Hubbard, on June 6, 1958.&lt;ref name="Miller230"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

A change in the visa regime in the UK enabled foreigners to remain indefinitely if they had sufficient means to support themselves. The Hubbards moved back to London in February 1959, settling for a while in [[Golders Green]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long afterwards Hubbard bought [[Saint Hill Manor]] at [[Saint Hill Green]], near [[East Grinstead]], [[West Sussex]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;  The manor, a [[country house]] formerly owned by [[Sawai Man Singh II of Jaipur|Sawai Man Singh II]], the [[Maharajah]] of [[Jaipur]], became both the new home of the Hubbards and the world headquarters of Scientology.

The Hubbards continued to carry out auditing of each other and in February 1960 Mary Sue wrote to a friend to inform her that her husband had discovered that she had been the writer [[D.H. Lawrence]] in a past life. She intended to make use of this discovery by writing a book that would be "completely anti-Christ". The protagonist, "a bastard child", would be the son of the three most virile men in the town (a satire of the [[Holy Trinity]]). The mother had slept with all three men on the same night but as she did not know which had fathered the child, had "thereupon decided to call him Ali, son of ----, son of ----, and son of ---- which impressed the local inhabitants and created a stir throughout the country."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Mary Sue was working as the chief course supervisor at Saint Hill Manor.&lt;ref name="Miller230" /&gt; The Hubbards' relationship was unconventional, as their butler, Ken Urquhart, later recalled: "Neither Ron nor Mary Sue lived the way one might have expected in a house like that. They spent most of their time working; there was very little socializing. They would go to bed very late, usually in the small hours of the morning, and get up in the early afternoon ... [Mary Sue] had a separate bedroom, but usually had breakfast with him – scrambled eggs, sausages, mushrooms and tomatoes. After breakfast he would go into his office and I would rarely see him again until six-thirty when I had to have the table laid for dinner. At six-twenty-five I would go into his office with a jacket for him to wear to table and after dinner they would spend an hour or so watching television with the children and then he and Mary Sue would return to work in their separate offices."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 250-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 1967, Mary Sue was confirmed as a Scientology "[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]", a somewhat elite rank at that time. Her achievement was commemorated in a special tribute edition of the Scientology newspaper ''The Auditor'', titled simply: "Mary Sue Hubbard – Clear #208".&lt;ref name="Auditor21" /&gt; In it, she thanked her husband "for having given the most precious gifts of freedom and true beingness to me and my fellow man. Without him, none of this would have been possible; and so to Ron goes my everlasting gratitude for having provided for all of us the road to Clear."&lt;ref name="Auditor21" /&gt;

==Life at sea==
During the late 1960s, Scientology was faced by an increasingly hostile media and intensifying government scrutiny in a number of countries, notably Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Hubbard decided to take to the high seas in a bid to liberate Scientology from the attentions of hostile governments.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 22, 1966, the Hubbard Explorational Company Limited was formed with Hubbard and Mary Sue as directors – Hubbard being described as expedition supervisor and Mary Sue as company secretary. Several ships were purchased to serve as the quarters of the newly created "[[Sea Org]]". The flagship of the Scientology fleet was the 3,280 ton vessel {{HMS|Royal Scotsman||6}} – accidentally renamed the ''Royal Scotman'' due to a clerical error,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; a former cattle ferry on the [[Irish Sea]] run.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the vessel had been renovated by Scientologists, Mary Sue and the children moved into the upper-deck accommodation in November 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in the quality of living conditions between the Hubbards and the crew was stark:

{{quote|Most of the crew lived in cramped, smelly, roach-infested dormitories fitted with bunks in three tiers that left little room for personal possessions. Hubbard and Mary Sue each had their own state-rooms in addition to a suite on the promenade deck comprising an auditing-room, office, an elegant saloon and a wood-paneled dining-room, all off-limits to students and crew. Hubbard had a personal steward, as did Mary Sue and the Hubbard children, who all had their own cabins. Meals for the Commodore and his family were cooked in a separate galley by their personal chef, using ingredients brought by couriers from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In April 1969, Mary Sue was promoted by Hubbard to serve as the captain of the ''Royal Scotman'' and ordered to cruise up and down the coast of Spain to train the vessel's inexperienced crew of Scientologists, who had made a string of mistakes that infuriated Hubbard.&lt;ref name="Miller286"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; The trip had the air of a punishment detail and was dubbed the "liability cruise"; conditions on board were reportedly appalling. According to Russell Miller, "The crew worked to the point of exhaustion, the food was meager and no one was allowed to wash or change their clothes. Mary Sue enforced the rules rigidly but shared the privations, and was scrupulously fair and popular."&lt;ref name="Miller286"/&gt; The entire crew was forced to wear gray rags to symbolize their demotion; it was said that even Mary Sue's [[Welsh Corgi|corgi]] dog, Vixie, had a gray rag tied around her neck.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The "liability cruise" ended in June 1969.&lt;ref name="Miller286"/&gt; The ''Royal Scotman'' was later renamed the ''Apollo''.

Apart from captaining the ''Royal Scotman'' for a period, Mary Sue's duties included managing the sprawling empire of the Guardian's Office agency within the Church of Scientology and serving as the chair of an executive group known variously as the Commodore's Staff Aides, the Aides Council, and the International Board of Scientology Organizations. This body was responsible for overseeing each of the seven organizational subdivisions of the Church of Scientology. She played a central role in the financial management of the Church of Scientology's two principal corporations, the [[Church of Scientology of California]] and the United Kingdom Church of Scientology. She was a sole signatory to the Church of Scientology's trust accounts and was also a director of the Operation Transport Corporation (OTC), a company established in 1968 that served as a conduit for cash transfers from the Church of Scientology to L. Ron Hubbard personally; it was characterized by US Tax Court as a "sham corporation" whose role was the enrichment of the Hubbards. She personally handled large quantities of cash on Hubbard's behalf. In the summer of 1972, Hubbard ordered that around $2 million in cash be transferred from OTC bank accounts in [[Switzerland]] to the ''Apollo'', where it was stored for the next three years in a locked file cabinet to which Mary Sue Hubbard had the only set of keys. Her salary was relatively modest, amounting to $30,430 ($150,732 in 2007 prices) between 1970 and 1972, though she did also benefit from tens of thousands of dollars a year in living expenses paid for by the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;''Church of Scientology of California, Petitioner, v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Respondent. United States Tax Court Docket No. 3352-78'', September 24, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hubbards moved ashore in March 1972 after three years traveling aboard their ship from port to port in the Mediterranean. They set up home in a villa on the outskirts of the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] city of [[Tangier]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Their sojourn in Morocco ended abruptly in December 1972 when it became clear that the Church of Scientology was about to be indicted in France for fraud, and that Hubbard himself was potentially at risk of being extradited to appear in court if the case went to trial.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard returned to the United States, living under a false name in New York City while Mary Sue and the children remained aboard the ''Apollo''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 313-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  They were reunited in September 1973, when the possibility of extradition had passed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; When it became known in October 1974 that the FBI wished to interview Hubbard, Mary Sue persuaded her husband to avoid going ashore in the United States and the ''Apollo'' spent the next year sailing from port to port in the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scientology fleet was finally disbanded in 1975, when Hubbard decided to move ashore and establish a "land base" in [[Florida]]. He and Mary Sue moved initially to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] in August 1975. They lived there incognito for a few months before moving into an apartment in [[Dunedin, Florida|Dunedin]] on the west coast of Florida, a few miles north of the town of [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] where a Scientology front company had bought the old [[Fort Harrison Hotel]] to serve as Scientology's new headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 334-336.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the Hubbards was meant to be a secret, but in January 1976 he was recognized by a science fiction fan while on a shopping trip. Fearing arrest, he fled to Washington, D.C. with a handful of aides while Mary Sue was left behind in Florida continuing her day-to-day management activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 338-339.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1976, Hubbard's eldest son by Mary Sue, [[Quentin Hubbard|Quentin]], died by suicide at the age of 22. Mary Sue was grief-stricken, though she later attempted to persuade friends that Quentin had died from [[encephalitis]]. Her husband's reaction was one of fury, blaming Quentin for – in his eyes – letting him down.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Guardian's Office scandal==
[[File:IRS building on constitution avenue in DC.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The IRS building on [[Constitution Avenue]], Washington D.C., was infiltrated, bugged, and burglarized on Mary Sue Hubbard's orders.]]
{{Main|Operation Snow White}}
On July 8, 1977, 134 agents of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] simultaneously stormed the Church of Scientology's offices in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, seizing nearly 50,000 documents and other evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; The raids were in response to the federal government's discovery that the Church of Scientology had been carrying out a secret and highly illegal "dirty tricks" campaign against government agencies, individuals, and institutions deemed to be enemies of Scientology. A year later, on August 15, 1978, Mary Sue Hubbard was indicted by a [[grand jury]], accused of masterminding a conspiracy against the government in her capacity as head of the Church's Guardian's Office.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Sue was appointed by her husband as Guardian (later Controller) of the Guardian's Office (GO) in March 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 161, 165&lt;/ref&gt; Established in response to the battering that Scientology was receiving at the time from governments and the media, the GO was tasked with tackling any "threat of great importance" to Scientology. This work took a variety of forms, including public relations, legal actions, and the gathering of "intelligence" on perceived enemies. In the UK alone, it issued hundreds of writs against the media for publishing negative reports on Scientology. It carried out an international campaign against psychiatry, [[Interpol]], the US [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and various other government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Its eventual downfall was to result from the use of illegal methods, ordered and authorized by Mary Sue, to further its campaign.

Mary Sue was promoted to the position of Controller "for life" of the Guardian's Office in January 1969, with one of her subordinates, Jane Kember, being appointed to Mary Sue's old post of Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Sue continued to manage the GO from her various residences aboard the ''Apollo'', and the villa in Tangier. At the order of both of the Hubbards, the GO ran scores of operations against Scientology's enemies. The targets were not just external enemies but dissident Scientologists; in 1969, Mary Sue wrote an order directing the GO to cull information from the confessional folders of Scientologists, breaking a rule of confidence that was supposedly sacrosanct.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; L. Ron Hubbard was said to have been fully aware of the GO's actions; the US government would later declare him to be an "unindicted co-conspirator" in the GO's illegal activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of their primary targets was the IRS, with which Scientology was engaged in a bitter battle over tax exemptions. As part of a wider strategy codenamed [[Operation Snow White]], the GO succeeded in infiltrating a Scientologist into the IRS to steal files about the government's litigation strategy against Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Sue was closely involved in the strategy; a letter written by her, approving the thefts, was later used in evidence against her.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1976, she approved an illegal plan to obtain "non-FOI data" from the government, meaning classified documents not available through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]].&lt;ref name="Atack133"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The GO's agent in the IRS, Michael Meisner, was ordered to obtain all files concerning L. Ron and Mary Sue Hubbard from the IRS Office of International Operations, which he succeeded in infiltrating.&lt;ref name="Atack133"/&gt;

The espionage continued for another three months before Meisner's luck ran out and he was caught in June 1976. Although he bluffed it out initially, a warrant was issued for his arrest in August. The situation was potentially disastrous for the GO and caused panic among the leadership. Mary Sue conspired with her subordinates to concoct alibis for Meisner and work out how to keep him out of the hands of the authorities, keeping him in hiding under a series of false identities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Meisner became increasingly reluctant to cooperate with his GO handlers and in April 1977 he was forcibly taken by GO staff to a new hiding place. He succeeded in escaping in May and turned himself in to the FBI, making a full confession. The raids of July 1977 were the result.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case eventually came to trial in September 1979, following months of delay occasioned by a fierce rear-guard action by the Church of Scientology's lawyers. On October 8, a deal was struck between the government and the Church that the nine defendants – including Mary Sue – would each plead guilty to one charge of conspiracy if they agreed to sign a written stipulation by the government (essentially a public confession) of what they had done, thus avoiding a lengthy trial. They were formally found guilty on October 26, 1979. Mary Sue and two others received the heaviest penalties, a five-year prison sentence and a $10,000 fine. The other five defendants received lesser sentences and fines.&lt;ref name="Miller363"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], pp. 363-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband avoided being indicted but was extremely concerned that Mary Sue would betray him. One of his aides, David Mayo, was dispatched by Hubbard to suggest that Mary Sue might consider a divorce. According to Mayo:

{{quote|She was really offended and very upset. I thought she was going to blow my head off. I went back several times later to make sure that she wasn't going to rat on him. That's what he was really worried about, that she would reveal during the case that she was only relaying his orders. She had covered up for him so much, and there had been so many opportunities for her to betray him, that she couldn't believe he would think that. She kept saying to me, 'What is he worried about?' I thought to myself, 'My God, I can't tell her.'"&lt;ref name="Miller363" /&gt;}}

==Downfall==
[[File:Scientology building east hollywood los angeles.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The former Cedars of Lebanon hospital complex in Los Angeles, where the Guardian's Office was based.]]
Despite her conviction, Mary Sue remained in her post as Controller of the Guardian's Office (GO). There was no shortage of work for her to do; further legal difficulties were anticipated, as there was a New York grand jury investigating [[Operation Freakout]], the GO's campaign against New York author [[Paulette Cooper]], and a Florida grand jury looking into Scientology's activities in Clearwater.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Around the end of February 1980, Ron Hubbard went into hiding&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in seclusion in the small town of [[Creston, California]], for the remaining six years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 372-374&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Sue, who had last met with her husband a few months before his disappearance, never saw or heard from him again.&lt;ref name="Atack-265"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard nonetheless remained active in the management of Scientology. The criminal conviction of the GO's top executives triggered a lengthy power struggle at the top of the Church of Scientology, which would lead eventually to Mary Sue being forced into retirement. Under his doctrine he believed that "mistakes do not just happen, somebody causes them, always". A disaster on the scale of the GO criminal case was clearly the result of the activities of someone hostile to Scientology – a [[Suppressive Person]] – operating within the GO. He issued an internal directive in 1979 asserting that major failures must result from the presence of multiple Suppressives, who would need to be rooted out along with their "connections".&lt;ref name="Atack-265" /&gt; The downfall of the GO led Hubbard to distrust it, believing it to be riddled with Suppressives; he severed his communications with it&lt;ref name="Atack-247"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; and put his reliance instead on the [[Commodore's Messenger Organization]] (CMO), a group which he had formed in 1968 whose purpose was to relay messages to and from church staff as Ron's personal representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; The Messengers, who were mostly in their teens and early twenties, became Hubbard's sole means of communication with the Church.&lt;ref name="Atack-247" /&gt;

In 1981, the "All Clear Unit" was established within the CMO, tasked with the purpose of making it "All Clear" for Hubbard to come out of hiding. One of its principal figures was [[David Miscavige]], a 21-year-old Messenger who had worked as a cameraman for Hubbard.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1981, he met with Mary Sue to tell her that her position as Controller of the Guardian's Office was untenable.&lt;ref name="Atack-265" /&gt; She reacted angrily; in a 1992 trial in Canada, Miscavige told the court that she had called him "some pretty nasty names" and threatened him with a large ashtray held close to his face, but she had eventually agreed to step down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Small|first=Peter|title=Crimes outraged church trial told|work=The Toronto Star|date=1992-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently changed her mind, believing that she had been tricked, and wrote to her husband to complain but received no response. Numerous other Guardian's Office personnel were purged as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1981, all remaining GO staff were ordered to join the Sea Org, which would thus secure the CMO's control of the Guardian's Office, and the current Guardian, Jane Kember – who was one of those convicted on conspiracy charges – was to be removed. Mary Sue strongly opposed these changes and reappointed herself Controller, rescinding the CMO's permission to investigate the GO. CMO staff investigating the GO were physically expelled from the Church of Scientology's Los Angeles headquarters, and the Controller's files were guarded day and night. Mary Sue attempted to contact her husband to rescind the CMO's takeover bid but failed, and admitted defeat when the Messengers produced an undated dispatch from Hubbard instructing the GO to be put under the CMO when its senior executives went to prison.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; She stood down again, being replaced by a South African Scientologist named Gordon Cook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dart|first=John|title=Shake-up of Scientology agency told|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1981-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jane Kember was replaced by [[David Gaiman]], a British Scientologist.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Miscavige provided a first-hand account of these events, in an affidavit submitted in a case heard in 1994 in California, ''Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz''. He stated:

{{quote|In 1981, a Church investigation was begun into the activities of the GO.  That investigation was prompted by the existence of a number of civil law suits which had been filed at that time against Church of Scientology of California and Mr.  Hubbard, and which the GO was supposed to be responsible for handling.  Not only was the GO not handling these suits, the GO, and particularly Mary Sue Hubbard, even refused to answer our questions about the suits because they viewed themselves answerable only to persons within the GO...

Our attempts to get information were thwarted by Mary Sue Hubbard.  She informed us that she did not appreciate our investigation of the GO and that if one were needed she would do it.  In March 1981 she cut all of our communication lines to the GO, except through herself.  It must be noted that Mary Sue Hubbard believed her position as Controller and as the "Founder's wife" to be unassailable and beyond reproach by anyone but Mr.  Hubbard -- who was not around at the time, a fact that she was well aware of.  This, plus her absolute control of the GO, made it difficult for the Church missionaires [Sea Org staff dispatched to achieve a target or specific goal] to get anything done.

[It] was made clear that we had no choice but to overthrow the GO and dismiss everyone who had violated Church policy or the law. These activities ultimately led to a complete disband of the GO.  I gathered a couple of dozen of the most proven Church executives from around the world and briefed them on the criminal and other unethical conduct of the GO.  Together, we planned a series of missions to take over the GO, investigate it and reform it thoroughly.  On July 13, 1981, a matter of weeks after we had uncovered what was going on, and with no advance warning to the GO, a coordinated series of CMO missions were sent out concurrently to take over the GO.  However, there were a number of obstacles to overcome before the termination of the GO could be accomplished.  Mary Sue Hubbard was still asserting her authority over the GO from her position as Controller.

Mary Sue Hubbard was removed from her post before she went to jail.  I know, because I personally met with her and obtained her resignation...  At first, Mary Sue Hubbard was not willing to resign.  Eventually she did so.  Mary Sue Hubbard and the GO, however, did not simply capitulate.  Within a day of Mary Sue Hubbard's resignation, senior GO officials secretly met with Mary Sue Hubbard and conspired to regain control of the GO.  Mary Sue Hubbard signed a letter revoking her resignation and condemning the actions of the CMO.  Scores of GO staff responded, locking the missionaires out of their premises and were intending to hire armed guards to bar access by me and the other Church officials who had ousted them.  I then confronted the mutineers, and persuaded Mary Sue Hubbard to again resign, which ended the last vestige of GO resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clambake.org/archive/go/legal/poodle.htm Affidavit of David Miscavige], February 17, 1994. ''Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz'', case no. CV 91-6426 HLH(Tx)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Speaking several years later to the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' newspaper, Miscavige commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I knew if it was going to be a physical takeover we're going to lose because they had a couple thousand staff and we (the "messengers") had about 50. That is the amazing part about it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard himself did not find out about Mary Sue's resignation until five months later.&lt;ref name="The man"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tobin|first=Thomas|title=The man behind Scientology|url=http://www.sptimes.com/TampaBay/102598/scientologypart3.html|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=1998-10-05|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convictions of Mary Sue Hubbard and the other GO staff executives were upheld by a federal appeals court in October 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McMahon|first=Patrick|title=Court upholds convictions of 9 Scientologists|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZvoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FHsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6109%2C5886649|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=1981-10-06|accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November seven of those convicted dropped their appeals – but not Mary Sue, who continued to fight the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McMahon|first=Patrick|title=7 Scientologists drop appeals, face jail terms|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lost her final appeal in April 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mann|first=Jim|title=Scientology Founder's Wife Loses Final High Court Plea, Faces Prison |work=Los Angeles Times|date=1982-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ordered to begin a prison term in January 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kamen|first=Al|title=Scientology founder's wife gets prison term|work=Washington Post|date=1983-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original sentence of five years imprisonment was not carried out, and the court ordered a study of her claimed medical problems, before eventually replacing her sentence with a four-year term of imprisonment, with parole set at 40 months.&lt;ref name="LAT-1983-01-08"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology Founder's Wife Ordered to Prison|date=1983-01-08|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sent to the [[Federal Medical Center, Lexington|federal prison]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], to serve her sentence,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; though in the end, she was released after only a year of imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Sun-1984-05-08"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shelor|first=George-Wayne|title=L.

==Life after the Guardian's Office==

After her resignation from the GO, Mary Sue Hubbard ceased to have any involvement in the management of the Church of Scientology. She did, however, resurface on a few occasions during the remaining years of her life. In 1984 she acted as an "intervenor" in the Church of Scientology of California's lawsuit against [[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]]. He had worked as an archivist for the Church of Scientology, gathering source material for a planned biography of L. Ron Hubbard. He became disillusioned with Scientology and left the Church, taking with him copies of biographical material, including Hubbard's letters to Mary Sue over the years. The Church sued in 1982 and Mary Sue joined the suit, charging that Armstrong had committed an "invasion of privacy".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 330-332&lt;/ref&gt; When the case came to trial in May 1984, she told the [[Superior Court of Los Angeles County]] that she had been "mentally raped" and "emotionally distressed" knowing that others had seen the documents. She told the court that she had not seen her husband since January 1980, "but I've written him personal letters ... but I don't believe he's getting them" as he had not replied to them.&lt;ref name="Sun-1984-05-08" /&gt; In June 1984, Judge Paul G. Breckenridge ruled against the Church and Mary Sue Hubbard, criticizing her credibility as a witness:

{{quote|LRH's wife, Mary Sue Hubbard is also plaintiff herein. On the one hand she certainly appeared to be a pathetic individual. She was forced from her post as controller, convicted and imprisoned as a felon, and deserted by her husband. On the other hand her credibility leaves much to be desired. She struck the familiar pose of not seeing, hearing or knowing any evil. Yet she was the head of the Guardian Office for years and among other things, authored the infamous order "GO 121669" which directed culling of supposedly confidential P.C. files/folders for purposes of internal security ...{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

It is, of course, rather ironic that the person who authorized G.O. 121669 should complain about invasion of privacy. The practice of culling supposedly confidential "P.C. folders or files" to obtain information for purposes of intimidation and or harassment is repugnant. The Guardian Office was no respector of anyone's civil rights, particularly that of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breckenridge |first=Paul G. |title=Church of Scientology of California, Plaintiff, Mary Sue Hubbard, Intervenor, vs. Gerald Armstrong, Defendant – Memorandum of Intended Decision |url=http://lisatrust.freewinds.cx/legal/armstrong/decision.htm |publisher=Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles |date=1984-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115072318/http://lisatrust.freewinds.cx/legal/armstrong/decision.htm |archivedate=2007-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A month later, in the English [[High Court of Justice]], [[John Latey (judge)|Mr Justice Latey]] [[Scientology in the United Kingdom#The Latey judgement|declared in a case]] in which Scientology was a prominent issue that "Mr Hubbard is a charlatan and worse, as are his wife, Mary Sue Hubbard, and the clique at the top privy to the cult's activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knight|first=Maureen|title=Judge Raps 'Slave' Cult|work=Daily Express|date=1984-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1984, Mary Sue filed a $5 million lawsuit against her husband's first son, [[Ronald DeWolf]], accusing him of "massive fraud" for attempting to have his father declared legally dead or mentally incompetent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Son of Church Founder Is Sued by Stepmother|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/24/us/around-the-nation-son-of-church-founder-is-sued-by-stepmother.html|publisher=Associated Press|date=1984-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; L. Ron Hubbard died on January 24, 1986, at his ranch near [[Creston, California]].&lt;ref name="Atack, p. 351"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;

A Scientology spokesman informed the press that she had been left "a very generous provision" in her husband's will,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Welkos|first=Robert|author2=Sappel, Joel|title=Scientology Church Says Founder Hubbard Is Dead|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1986-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the details were kept secret.&lt;ref name="Atack, p. 351"/&gt; Mary Sue Hubbard continued to be active in Scientology well into the 1990s; in a 1994 Scientology magazine, she was listed as a "Patron" of the [[International Association of Scientologists]], indicating a donation of $40,000.&lt;ref&gt;IAS Patrons, Impact #53 (1994), pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1995, Hubbard had a [[mastectomy]] of her left breast. In 1998 she was diagnosed with metastatic [[breast cancer]] in addition to her existing [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). Mary Sue Hubbard died on November 25, 2002, aged 71, at her home in Los Angeles. Her body was cremated two days later and her ashes were scattered at sea off the California coast,&lt;ref name="death certificate" /&gt; where L. Ron Hubbard's ashes had similarly been scattered in January 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Founder's Spirit Lives On, Scientologists Proclaim|publisher=United Press International|date=1986-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narasimha iconography shows him with a human torso and lower body, with a lion face and claws, typically with a demon [[Hiranyakashipu]] in his lap whom he is in the process of killing.

He is known as ''Narasingh'', ''Narasingha'',''Nrusingha'', ''Narasimba'' and ''Narasinghar'' in derivative languages. His other names are ''Agnilochana'' (अग्निलोचन) - the one who has fiery eyes, ''Bhairavadambara'' (भैरवडम्बर) - the one who causes terror by roaring, ''Karala'' (कराल) - the one who has a wide mouth and projecting teeth, ''Hiranyakashipudvamsa'' (हिरण्यकशिपुध्वंस) - the one who killed Hiranyakashipu, ''Nakhastra'' (नखास्त्र) - the one for whom nails are his weapons, ''Sinhavadana'' (सिंहवदन) - the whose face is of lion and ''Mrigendra'' (मृगेन्द्र) - king of animals or lion.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

===Vedas===
The Vishnu hymn 1.154 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' (1500-1200 BCE) contains a verse with allusions to a "wild beast, dread, prowling, mountain-roaming",&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_1/Hymn_154 The Rigveda Mandala 1 Hymn 154], Ralph T.H. Griffith, Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; which has been interpreted by some to be the Narasiṃha legend. Another hymn 8.14 alludes to the Namuci legend with "waters' foam you tore off, Indra, the head of Namuci, subduing all contending hosts", but the hymns does not present details.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p37"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah A. Soifer|title=The Myths of Narasimha and Vamana: Two Avatars in Cosmological Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OoFDK_sDGHwC&amp;pg=PA37|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0799-8|pages=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more complete version of the Namuci legend is found in ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' of the ''[[Yajurveda]]'' in chapter 12.7.3.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p37"/&gt; Other references to Narasimha are found in the Vedic texts Vajaseneyi Samhita 10.34, Pancavimsa Brahmana 12.6.8 and Taittiriya Brahmana 1.7.1.6.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p37"/&gt;

====The Indra-Namuci legend====
Narasimha likely has roots in the metaphors filled Indra-Namuci legend in the Vedas.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p37"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bloomfield | first=Maurice | title=Contributions to the Interpretation of the Veda | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | publisher=American Oriental Society | volume=15 | year=1893 | doi=10.2307/592353 | pages=143-156}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indra]] is the [[dharma|dharmic]] leader of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] who commands lightning, thunder, rain and rivers, while Namuci is a deceptive demigod [[Asura]] in competition for power. Namuci suggests peace to Indra, which the latter accepts. He demands Indra to promise that he will neither try to slay him with his "palm of the hand nor with the fist", neither in day nor in night, neither "anything that the dry" nor "anything that is moist". Indra agrees.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p37"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fowler | first=Murray | title=The Role of Surā in the Myth of Namuci | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | publisher=American Oriental Society | volume=62 | issue=1 | year=1942 | doi=10.2307/594098 | pages=36-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the deal is done, Namuci carries away all that nourishes the Devas: the Soma drink, the essence of food and the strength of Indra. The leader of the gods finds himself conflicted, feels bound by his promise. Indra then meets [[Saraswati]] (goddess of knowledge) and Ashvins.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p37"/&gt;  They reply they will deal with Namuci, get it all back, if Indra agrees to share his powers, the essence of food and the Soma drink with them. Indra agrees. The gods and the goddess then come up with a creative plan. They pour out "foam of water" as a thunderbolt, which is neither dry nor moist, and the evil Asura Namuci is attacked and killed when it is neither day nor night.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p37"/&gt;

After Namuci is killed, the gods get all the powers back, but discover that Namuci had drunk the Soma already. The good was thus now mixed with his badness of his blood, which they did not want to drink. So, they extract the good out from the bad. Thus, good returns to the Devas, the bad is discarded.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p37"/&gt;

According to Deborah Soifer, the Vedic legend has many parallels with the Narasimha legend, it has the same plot, the same "neither-nor" constraints, and the same creative spirit that allows the good to vanquish the evil. Further, the Sanskrit words and phrasing such as "neither palm nor fist" and "neither day nor night" in the later Hindu texts is the same as in the Vedic texts. This suggests a link and continuity between the Vedic Namuci legend and the later Narasimha legend in the Puranas.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p37"/&gt; According to Walter Ruben, both versions along with several other legends in ancient and medieval texts reflect the Indian tradition against despots and tyrants who abuse power.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ruben (1968), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41694231 Fighting against despotes in old Indian literature], Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Vol. 48/49, Golden Jubilee, Volume 1917-1967 (1968), pp. 111-118&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Prahlāda legend===
[[File:Vishnu narasimha.JPG|thumb|Viṣṇu as Narasiṃha kills Hiraṇyakaśipu, stone sculpture from the [[Hoysaleswara Temple]] in [[Halebidu]], Karnataka]]
The Bhagavata Purāṇa describes that Vishnu, in his previous avatar as [[Varaha|Varāha]], killed the evil [[asura]] [[Hiranyaksha|Hiraṇayakṣa]]. The elder brother of [[Hiranyaksha|Hirṇayakṣa]], demon king [[Hiranyakashipu|Hiraṇyakaśipu,]] hated Vishnu and wanted revenge.&lt;ref name="dalal2010p148"/&gt; He undertook many years of austere penance to gain special powers. Thereafter, Brahma offered Hiraṇyakaśipu a boon. Hiraṇyakaśipu asked, "Grant me that I not die within any residence or outside any residence, during the daytime or at night, nor on the ground or in the sky. Grant me that my death not be brought about by any weapon, nor by any human being or animal. Grant me that I not meet death from any entity, living or nonliving created by you. Grant me, further, that I not be killed by any demigod or demon or by any great snake from the lower planets." Brahma granted him the boon, and Hiraṇyakaśipu gained these powers.&lt;ref name="dalal2010p262"/&gt;

{{double image|left|Relief of Lord Narasimha at Bhadrachalam Temple.jpg|200|Jwala yoganarasimhar.jpg|130|Narasimha at Bhadrachalam Temple and [[Alagar Koyil]] Temple respectively.}}
Hiraṇyakaśipu, once powerful and invincible with the new boon, began to persecute those who were devotees of Vishnu. Hiraṇyakaśipu had a son, Prahlāda, who disagreed and rebelled against his father. Prahlāda became a devotee of Vishnu. This angered Hiraṇyakaśipu, who tried to kill the boy -- but with each attempt, Prahlāda was protected by Viṣṇu's mystical power. When asked, Prahlāda refused to acknowledge his father as the supreme lord of the universe and claimed that Viṣṇu is all-pervading and [[omnipresent]].

[[File:Narasimha Disemboweling Hiranyakashipu, Folio from a Bhagavata Purana (Ancient Stories of the Lord) LACMA M.82.42.8 (1 of 5).jpg|thumb|right|Narasiṃha kills [[Hiranyakashipu|Hiraṇyakaśipu]], as [[Prahlāda]] and Lakshmi devi bow before Lord Narasiṃha]]
Hiraṇyakaśipu pointed to a nearby pillar and asked if 'his Viṣṇu' is in it and said to his son Prahlāda, "O most unfortunate Prahlāda, you have always described a supreme being other than me, a supreme being who is above everything, who is the controller of everyone, and who is all-pervading. But where is He? If He is everywhere, then why is He not present before me in this pillar?" Prahlāda then answered, "He was, He is and He will be."{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In an alternate version of the story, Prahlāda answered,&lt;blockquote&gt;''He is in pillars, and he is in the smallest twig''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hiraṇyakaśipu, unable to control his anger, smashed the pillar with his mace, and following a tumultuous sound, Viṣṇu in the form of Narasiṃha appeared from it and moved to attack Hiraṇyakaśipu in defense of Prahlāda. In order to kill Hiraṇyakaśipu and not upset the boon given by [[Brahma]], the form of Narasiṃha was chosen. Hiraṇyakaśipu could not be killed by human, deva or animal. Narasiṃha was none of these, as he is a form of Viṣṇu incarnate as a part-human, part-animal.  He came upon Hiraṇyakaśipu at twilight (when it is neither day nor night) on the threshold of a courtyard (neither indoors nor out), and put the demon on his thighs (neither earth nor space). Using his sharp fingernails (neither [[animate]] nor [[inanimate]]) as weapons, he disemboweled and killed the demon king.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The Kūrma Purāṇa describes the preceding battle between the [[Purusha|Puruṣa]] and demonic forces in which he escapes a powerful weapon called [[Pashupatastra|Paśupāta]]. According to Soifer, it describes how Prahlāda's brothers headed by Anuhrāda and thousands of other demons "were led to the valley of death (yamalayam) by the lion produced from the body of man-lion".&lt;ref&gt;Soifer, p.85: K.P.1.15.70&lt;/ref&gt; The same episode occurs in the ''Matsya Purāṇa'' 179, several chapters after its version of the Narasiṃha advent.&lt;ref name = "Soifer"/&gt;

==Iconography==
{{double image|right|Deshaavathaaram4 narasimham.jpg|110|7 La statue de Narasimha Hampi Vijayanagar Karnataka India April 2014.jpg|170|Various icons of Narasimha}}
Narasimha is always shown with a lion face with clawed fingers fused with a human body. Sometimes he is coming out of a pillar signifying that he is everywhere, in everything, in everyone. Some temples such as at [[Ahobilam]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], the iconography is more extensive, and includes nine other icons of Narasimha:&lt;ref name="dalal2010p262"/&gt;
*Prahladavarada: blessing Prahlada
*Yogānanda-narasiṃha: serene, peaceful Narasimha teaching yoga
*Guha-narasiṃha: concealed Narasimha
*Krodha-narasiṃha: angry Narasimha
*Vira-narasimha: warrior Narasimha
*Malola-narasiṃha or Lakshmi-narasimha: with [[Lakshmi]] his wife
*Jvala-narasiṃha: Narasimha emitting flames of wrath
*Sarvatomukha-narasimha: many faced Narasimha
*Bhishana-narasimha: ferocious Narasimha
*Bhadra-narasimha: another fierce aspect of Narasimha
*Mrityormrityu-narasimha: defeater of death aspect of Narasimha

The earliest known iconography of Narasimha is variously dated to between the 2nd and the 4th-century CE, and these have been found in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref name=merister292/&gt; Most images and temples of Narasimha are found in the peninsular region of India, but important ancient and medieval archeological sites containing Narasimha icons are also found as [[Vaikuntha Chaturmurti]] in Kashmir and [[Khajuraho temples]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexandra Anna Enrica van der Geer|title=Animals in Stone: Indian Mammals Sculptured Through Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ3quxh9gsgC |year=2008|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-16819-2|pages=404–407}}&lt;/ref&gt; while single face versions are found in [[Garhwa]] and [[Mathura]] (Uttar Pradesh) and in [[Ellora Caves]] (Maharashtra).&lt;ref name="dalal2010p262"/&gt; Other major temples with notable icons  of Narasimha are found in Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] ruins in Karnataka.&lt;ref name="dalal2010p262"/&gt; Some of the oldest surviving Hindu temples, such as those found in [[Tigawa]] and [[Eran]] (Madhya Pradesh), dated to early 5th-century, include Narasimha along with other avatars of Vishnu.&lt;ref name=merister292/&gt;

==Significance==
Narasimha is a significant iconic symbol of creative resistance, hope against odds, victory over persecution, and destruction of evil. He is the destructor of not only external evil, but also one's own inner evil of "body, speech, and mind" states Pratapaditya Pal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Pratapaditya Pal|title=Indian Sculpture: Circa 500 B.C.-A.D. 700|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=clUmKaWRFTkC |year=1986|publisher= University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05991-7|pages=42-43}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In South Indian art – sculptures, bronzes and paintings – Viṣṇu's incarnation as Narasiṃha is one of the most chosen themes and amongst [[Avatar|Avatāra]]s perhaps next only to [[Rama|Rāma]] and [[Krishna|Kṛṣṇa]] in popularity. Lord Narasiṃha also appears as one of [[Hanuman]]'s 5 faces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://indianastrology.co.in/1056-shri-panchmukhi-hanuman-story-behind-five-faces-lord-hanuman/ | title=Shri Panchmukhi Hanuman – The Story Behind The Five Faces of Lord Hanuman | work=Indian Astrology | date=24 October 2016 | accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is a significant character in the [[Ramayan|Rāmāyaṇa]] as Lord ([[Rama|Rāma's]]) devotee.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Narasimha is worshipped across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh States in numerous forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vemsani|first1=Lavanya|title=Narasimha, The Supreme Deity of Andhra Pradesh: Tradition and Innovation in Hinduism- An Examination of the Temple Myths, Folk Stories, and Popular Culture|journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion|date=2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=35–52|url=https://www.academia.edu/231458/Narasimha_The_Supreme_Deity_of_Andhra_Pradesh_Tradition_and_Innovation_in_Hinduism-_An_Examination_of_the_Temple_Myths_Folk_Stories_and_Popular_Culture_Journal_of_Contemporary_Religion_Vol.24.1_Jan_2009_35-52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, it is common that each of the temples contain depictions of Narasimha in more than one form, Ahobilam contains nine temples of Narasimha dedicated to the nine forms of Narasimha. It is also notable that the central aspect of Narasimha incarnation is killing the demon Hiranyakasipu, but that image of Narasimha is not commonly worshipped in temples, although it is depicted.

===Coins, inscriptions and terracotta===
The Narasimha legend was influential by the 5th-century, when various Gupta Empire kings minted coins with his images or sponsored inscriptions that associated the ethos of Narasimha with their own. The kings thus legitimized their rule as someone like Narasimha who fights evil and persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel E Bassuk|title=Incarnation in Hinduism and Christianity: The Myth of the God-Man|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=k3iwCwAAQBAJ |year=1987|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-08642-9|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the coins of the Kushan era show Narasimha-like images, suggesting possible influence.&lt;ref&gt;Emilia Smagur 92015), Vaishnavite Influences in the Kushan Coinage, ''Notae Numismaticae. Zapiski numizmatyczne'', Issue 10, pages 63-85&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the oldest Narasimha terracotta artworks have been dated to about the 2nd-century CE, such as those discovered in Kausambi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Los Angeles County Museum of Art|author2=Pratapaditya Pal|title=Indian Sculpture: Circa 500 B.C.-A.D. 700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=clUmKaWRFTkC |year=1986|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05991-7|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nearly complete, exquisitely carved standing Narasimha statue, wearing a ''pancha'', with personified attributes near him has been found at the Mathura archeological site and is dated to the 6th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Los Angeles County Museum of Art|author2=Pratapaditya Pal|title=Indian Sculpture: Circa 500 B.C.-A.D. 700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=clUmKaWRFTkC |year=1986|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05991-7|pages= 252-253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance arts===
The Narasimha legends have been a part of various [[Indian classical dance]] repertoire. For example, [[Kathakali]] theatre has included the Narasimha-Hiranyakasipu battle storyline, and adaptations of ''Prahlada Caritam'' with Narasimha has been one of the popular performances in [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Philip Zarrilly|title=The Kathakali Complex: Performance &amp; Structure|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CjwYysH2ZQIC |year=1984 |publisher= Abhinav Publications|isbn= 978-81-7017-187-4|pages=160–161, 202–212, xxxvi (Figure 12)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Bhagavata Mela]] dance-drama performance arts of Tamil Nadu traditionally celebrate the annual Narasimha jayanti festival by performing the story within regional Narasimha temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farley P.

===Prayers===
A number of prayers have been written in dedication to Narasiṃha avatāra. These include:{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Early images==
[[File:Narasimha statue at National Museum, New Delhi.jpg|thumb|Narasiṃha statue]]

In [[Andhra Pradesh]], a panel dating to third-fourth century AD shows a full theriomorphic squatting lion with two extra human arms behind his shoulders holding [[Vaishnav|Vaiṣṇava]] emblems. This lion, flanked by five heroes (''vīra''), often has been identified as an early depiction of Narasiṃha.&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Waheed Khan, ''An Early Sculpture of Narasiṁha'', Andhra Pradesh Government Archaeological Series 16, Hyderabad: Government of Andhra Pradesh, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Standing cult images of Narasiṃha from the early Gupta period, survive from temples at Tigowa and Eran.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of India, Annual Reports IX (1873-75), p.47&lt;/ref&gt; These sculptures are two-armed, long maned, frontal, wearing only a lower garment, and with no demon-figure of Hiraṇyakaśipu. Images representing the narrative of Narasiṃha slaying the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu survive from slightly later Gupta-period temples: one at Madhia and one from a temple-doorway now set into the Kūrma-maṭha at Nachna, both dated to the late fifth or early sixth century A.D.&lt;ref name="Michael W. Meiste 1996 pp. 291-301"&gt;Michael W. Meiste, ''Man and Man-Lion: The Philadelphia Narasiṁha'', Artibus Asiae, Vol. 56, No. 3/4 (1996), pp. 291–301&lt;/ref&gt;

An image of Narasiṃha supposedly dating to second-third century AD sculpted at [[Mathura]] was acquired by the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1987. It was described by Stella Kramrisch, the former Philadelphia Museum of Art's Indian curator, as "''perhaps the earliest image of Narasiṃha as yet known''".&lt;ref name="Michael W. Meiste 1996 pp. 291-301" /&gt; This figure depicts a furled brow, fangs, and lolling tongue similar to later images of Narasiṃha, but the idol's robe, simplicity, and stance set it apart. On Narasiṃha's chest under his upper garment appears the suggestion of an amulet, which Stella Kramrisch associated with Visnu's cognizance, the Kauṣtubha jewel. This upper garment flows over both shoulders; but below Hiranyakasipu, the demon-figure placed horizontally across Narasiṃha's body, a twisted waist-band suggests a separate garment covering the legs. The demon's hair streams behind him, cushioning his head against the man-lion's right knee. He wears a simple single strand of beads. His body seems relaxed, even pliant. His face is calm, with a slight suggestion of a smile. His eyes stare adoringly up at the face of Viṣṇu. There is little tension in this figure's legs or feet, even as Narasiṃha gently disembowels him. His innards spill along his right side. As the [[Matsya purana]] describes it, Narasiṃha ripped "apart the mighty Daitya chief as a plaiter of straw mats shreds his reeds".&lt;ref name="Michael W. Meiste 1996 pp. 291-301" /&gt; Based on the [[Gandhara]]-style of robe worn by the idol, Michael Meiste altered the date of the image to fourth century AD.&lt;ref name="Michael W. Meiste 1996 pp. 291-301" /&gt;

An image of Narasiṃha, dating to the 9th century, was found on the northern slope of Mount Ijo, at Prambanan, Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Fontein]], et al. (1990). The sculpture of Indonesia, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Images of Trivikrama and Varāha avatāras were also found at Prambanan, Indonesia. Viṣṇu and His avatāra images follow iconographic peculiarities characteristic of the art of central Java. This includes physiognomy of central Java, an exaggerated volume of garment, and some elaboration of the jewelry. This decorative scheme once formulated became, with very little modification, an accepted norm for sculptures throughout the Central Javanese period (circa 730–930 A.D.). Despite the iconographic peculiarities, the stylistic antecedents of the Java sculptures can be traced back to Indian carvings as the Chalukya and Pallava images of the 6th–7th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Debjani Paul (1978) ''Deity or Deified King? Reflections on a Unique Vaiṣṇavite Sculpture from Java', Artibus Asiae, Vol. 40, No. 4 (1978), pp. 311–333.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Painting of the Six Kings''''' is a [[fresco]] found on the wall of [[Qasr Amra]], a [[desert castles|desert castle]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] located in modern-day [[Jordan]]. It depicts six rulers standing in two rows of three.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=198}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} Four of the six have inscriptions in [[Arabic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] identifying them as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor, King [[Roderic]] of [[Hispania]], the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] emperor, and the [[Negus]] of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]].&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=205}} The painting, now substantially damaged, is thought to be from between 710 and 750,{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=121}} commissioned by the Umayyad [[caliphate|caliph]] or someone in his family.{{sfn|Grabar|1954|p=187}} It is one of the most famous frescoes in the Qasr Amra complex.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=197}}

==Location and history==
[[File:Qusayr Amra.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Qasr Amra]] complex, the site of the painting]]
[[File:AloisMusil1901.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Alois Musil, the first Westerner who encountered the painting.{{sfn|Khouri|1990}}]]
The painting is located in [[Qasr Amra]] (also transcribed "Quseir Amra", literally "little palace of Amra"), an Umayyad desert structure and a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Quseir Amra|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/327|author=UNESCO|work=World Heritage List}}&lt;/ref&gt; about {{convert|85|km|mi}} east of [[Amman]] and {{convert|21|km|mi}} southwest of the [[Azraq Wetland Reserve]], [[Jordan]].{{sfn|Khouri|1990}} The complex has several frescoes painted on its walls.{{sfn|Khouri|1990}} The remoteness and size of the structure suggest that it served as a desert retreat for Umayyad rulers at the time.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}

The painting is on the southern end of the west portion of the main wall.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=197}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} Along with other works in the complex, it was cleaned and preserved in the 1970s by a team from the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]].{{sfn|Khouri|1990}}

Historian Elizabeth Drayson estimated the earliest possible date for the painting to be 710, the year of the accession of Roderic{{snd}}one of the kings portrayed in the painting{{snd}}and the latest to be 750, the year of [[Abbasid Revolution]] that overthrew the Umayyads.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=121}} The artist who painted the fresco is unknown. The patron who commissioned the building, including the painting, was likely one of the caliphs [[al-Walid I]] (reigned 705–715), [[al-Walid II]] ({{r.}}{{nbsp}}743–744) or [[Yazid III]] ({{r.}}{{nbsp}}744).{{sfn|Baker|1980}} It might have been commissioned after the patron became caliph, or before, when the patron was a member of the caliph's family and held the position of governor or heir.{{sfn|Baker|1980}}

The complex, long familiar to local nomads, was discovered (to the West) by the Czech scholar [[Alois Musil]] in 1898.{{sfn|Khouri|1990}} Musil and his companion, Austrian artist [[Alphons Leopold Mielich]], tried to remove the painting from the site, causing permanent damage.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=198}} A fragment of the painting, containing labels and partial crowns of two of the figures, is now in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Museum of Islamic Art (Berlin)|de|3=Museum für Islamische Kunst (Berlin)|lt=Museum of Islamic Art}}, [[Berlin]].{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=12}}{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=203}}&lt;ref&gt;Museum für Islamische Kunst, Berlin, inv. no. I.1265&lt;/ref&gt;

Musil's 1907 publication ''Kusejr 'Amra''{{sfn|Musil|1907}} included a [[tracing (art)|tracing]] made by Mielich on the spot, Musil's interpretative copy made on the spot, Mielich's later reproduction, and Mielich's written description of the painting.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=12}}{{sfn|Fowden|2004|pp=203–204}} This publication included their observations made before much of the damage to the painting was done.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=204}}

==Description==
[[File:Amra5.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A 1907 reproduction of the damaged painting&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;]]
The painting is badly damaged, partly due to the efforts by Alois Musil to remove it.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=198}} Large portions of the figures and their garments are not clearly visible. There are six rulers, or kings, standing facing the viewer in two rows of three.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=198}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} Each king stretches out both hands with palms turned upwards. Inscriptions in Greek and Arabic above four of the figures, written in white letters on a blue background,{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=203}} identify them as:&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}
* ''Kaisar''/''Qaysar'' ("[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]"), the Byzantine emperor, face not visible, wearing imperial robes and tiara,{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=204}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} 
* ''Rodorikos''/''Ludhriq'', [[Roderic]], the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king of Hispania, barely visible, except for the tip of his helmet and robes,{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=204}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}
* [[Khosrow (word)|''Khosroes''/''Kisra'']], the Sasanian emperor, appearing young with curly hair, wearing a crown, a cloak, and shoes,{{sfn|Fowden|2004|pp=204–205}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} and
* ''[[Armah|Najashi]]'', the Negus of the Kingdom of Aksum, in a light garment with red [[stole (shawl)|stole]].{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=205}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}

The labels were already fragile when Musil found it, and many of the labels were lost when he and Mielich tried to clean the painting and remove it from the site.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=203}} However, Musil's 1907 publication provided his reproduction of the labels before the damage.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=204}} Apart from the four rulers, no identification remains visible for the other two rulers. Possible identities speculated for them include the [[emperor of China]],&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; a [[Khan (title)|Turkic leader]],&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; and an Indian ruler.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}

Alongside the painting of the six kings, on the same wall, is a painting of a woman with the Greek word [[Nike (mythology)|ΝΙΚΗ]] ''Nikē'' "Victory" above her.{{sfn|Baker|1980}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=119}} Opposite the painting, towards which the six rulers are gesturing, is a painting of a man seated on a throne. Above this man is an inscription containing a blessing on a person whose name is now invisible.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=119}}

==Interpretation==
The intent and meaning of the painting are unclear, and disputed by scholars.{{sfn|Grabar|1954|p=185}} The highly diverse interpretations of the painting are partly due to the loss of information from the damage.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}

According to Islamic art consultant Patricia Baker, the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "victory" appearing nearby suggests that the image was meant to suggest the caliph's supremacy over his enemies.{{sfn|Baker|1980}} Betsy Williams of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] suggested that the six figures are depicted in supplication, presumably towards the caliph who would be seated in the hall.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; Other scholars, including Arabic [[epigraphist]] [[Max van Berchem]] and architectural historian [[K. A. C. Creswell]], argued that the six rulers are a representation of the defeated enemies of Islam.{{sfn|Grabar|1954|p=185}} [[Iranologist]] and archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld]] argued that the painting is an Umayyad copy or version of the Sassanian "Kings of the Earth" located at [[Kermanshah]], as recorded by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] in his work ''[[Mu'jam al-Buldan]]'' (''Dictionary of Countries'').{{sfn|Grabar|1954|p=185}} Art historian [[Oleg Grabar]] interpreted the painting as an attempt to convey the idea that the Umayyad dynasty was the descendant and heir of the dynasties it had defeated.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=121}}{{sfn|Grabar|1954}}

The name '''poppy goddess''' was given to a large female figurine which is believed to represent a [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] goddess, discovered in a sanctuary of the Post-palace period ([[Minoan chronology|LM III]], 1400&amp;ndash;1100 BC) at [[Gazi, Crete]], and now in the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]]. The terracotta figurine has raised hands and seeds of opium poppies on her head. &lt;ref name=Her.Museum&gt;J.A. Sakellarakis. ''Herakleion Museum. Illustrated guide to the Museum''. Ekdotike Athinon. Athens 1987. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period, [[Mycenae|Mycenean]] influence particularly on art was strong over the island, showing that Crete was now little more than a province of the Mycenean world after the Mycenean invasion in 1450 BC. [[Minoan pottery]] figurines were found in public sanctuaries, not only in palace-sanctuaries as is usual in earlier periods.&lt;ref name=Her.Museum/&gt; Clay idols with raised hands were also found in the shrine of double axes in [[Knossos]], in [[Gournia]], in [[Myrtos]],&lt;ref name=Burkert30&gt; Walter Burkert (1985). ''Greek religion'', Harvard University Press. pp. 23, 30 &lt;/ref&gt; and also in the sanctuaries of [[Gortys]] and [[Prinias]].&lt;ref name=Her.Museum/&gt; On the heads of the figures there are various religious symbols, such as horns of consecration, diadems, birds and the seeds of opium poppies. The female figure known as the ''poppy goddess'' is perhaps a representation of the goddess as the bringer of sleep or death.&lt;ref name=Her.Museum/&gt;

The figures found at Gazi, which are larger than any previously produced on Minoan Crete, are rendered in an extremely stylized manner. The bodies are lifeless, the skirts simple cylinders, and the poses stereotyped.

==Religious significance==
The raised hands of the idol indicate that it is a deity who gazes toward the visitor, and the gesture of the two upraised hands with open palms is the [[Theophany|epiphany]] gesture of the goddess.&lt;ref name=Burkert30/&gt; It is possible that the goddess is giving a greeting, or a blessing, or is praying, or it may symbolize her appearance in earth in human form.&lt;ref name=Her.Museum/&gt;
 
Poppies were used in Greco-Roman myths as offerings to the dead.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum. ''The Annotated wizard of Oz''. p 173  {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation|date=February 2013}} [[Robert Graves]] believed that a second meaning of the depiction and use of poppies in the Greco-Roman myths is the symbolism of the bright scarlet colour as signifying the promise of resurrection after death &lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]]. ''The Greek myths''. 24.15, p 96 {{ISBN|0-14-001026-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] was the emblem of the goddess [[Demeter]]. According to [[Theocritus]] for the Greeks Demeter was still a poppy goddess bearing [[sheave]]s and poppies in both hands (''Idyll'' vii 157). &lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi, 1976 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cXL-QIIhn5gC&amp;pg=PA23 p.23]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Kerenyi]] asserted that poppies were connected with a Cretan cult which was transmitted to the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] in [[Classical Greece]]: "It seems probable that the Great [[Mother Goddess]] who bore the names [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and Demeter, brought the [[poppy]] with her from her Cretan cult to [[Eleusis]] and it is almost certain that in the Cretan cult sphere [[opium]] was prepared from poppies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kerenyi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19185">{{Unreliable sources|date=November 2016}}[[File:Krishna and Arjun on the chariot, Mahabharata, 18th-19th century, India.jpg|250px|thumb|Krishna and Arjun on the chariot, 18th-19th century painting]]
The '''Puranic chronology''' gives a timeline of Hindu history according to the Hindu scriptures. Two central dates are the [[Kurukshetra War|Mahabharata War]], which according to this chronology happened at 3138 BCE, and the start of the [[Kali Yuga]], which according to this chronology started at 3102 BCE. The Puranic chronology is referred to by proponents of Indigenous Aryans to propose an earlier dating of the Vedic period, and the spread of Indo-European languages out of India. 

==Hindu scriptures==
The Puranas contain stories about the creation of the world, and the [[yugas]]. [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]] and the [[Purana]]s also contain genealogies of kings,{{sfn|Trautman|2005|p=xx}} which are used for the traditional chronology of India's ancient history. [[Michael Witzel]] doubts the reliability of these texts, concluding that they "have clearly lifted (parts of) lineages, fragment by fragment, from the [[Vedas]] and have supplied the rest ... —from hypothetical, otherwise unknown traditions—or, as can be seen in the case of the ''Mahābhārata'', from poetical imagination."{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=70}}

[[Gavin Flood]] connects the rise of the written Purana historically with the rise of  devotional cults centering upon a particular deity in the Gupta era: the Puranic corpus is a complex body of material that advance the views of various competing [[Sampradaya|''sampradayas'']].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p =359}} [[Wendy Doniger]], based on the study of indologists, assigns approximate dates to the various Puranas. She dates [[Markandeya Purana]] to c. 250 CE (with one portion dated to c. 550 CE), [[Matsya Purana]] to c. 250&amp;ndash;500 CE, [[Vayu Purana]] to c. 350 CE, [[Harivamsa]] and [[Vishnu Purana]] to c. 450 CE, [[Brahmanda Purana]] to c. 350&amp;ndash;950 CE, [[Vamana Purana]] to c. 450&amp;ndash;900 CE, [[Kurma Purana]] to c. 550&amp;ndash;850 CE, and [[Linga Purana]] to c. 600&amp;ndash;1000 CE.{{sfn|Collins|1988|p=36}}

==Puranic chronology==
The Puranas, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana also contain lists of kings and genealogies,{{sfn|Trautman|2005|p=xx}} from which the traditional chronology of India's ancient history are derived. The Vedic Foundation, for example, gives the following chronology of ancient India:&lt;ref group=web name="VF-Chronology" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Vedic Foundation, ''Introduction'': "The history of Bharatvarsh (which is now called India)'is the description of the timeless glory of the Divine dignitaries who not only Graced the soils of India with their presence and Divine intelligence, but they also showed and revealed the true path of peace, happiness and the Divine enlightenment for the souls of the world that still is the guideline for the true lovers of God who desire to taste the sweetness of His Divine love in an intimate style.&lt;ref group=web name="VF-Intro" /&gt;}}{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}

==Mahabharata War==
{{Main|Kurukshetra War}}

The historicity of the Mahabharata War is subject to scholarly discussion and dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KkpdLnZpm78C&amp;pg|title=Delhi: Ancient History|last=Singh|first=Upinder|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2006|isbn=|location=|page=85|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Singh|2009||p=19}} The existing text of the ''Mahabharata'' went through many layers of development, and mostly belongs to the period between c. 500 BCE and 400 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8sYSPhSBEAC|title=The Sauptikaparvan of the Mahabharata: The Massacre at Night|page=13|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=18-21}} Within the [[frame story]] of the ''Mahabharata'', the historical kings [[Parikshit]] and [[Janamejaya II|Janamejaya]] are featured significantly as scions of the Kuru clan,{{sfn|Witzel|1995}} and [[Michael Witzel]] concludes that the general setting of the epic has a historical precedent in Iron Age ([[Vedic India|Vedic]]) India, where the [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] kingdom was the center of political power during roughly 1200 to 800 BCE.{{sfn|Witzel|1995}} According to Professor [[Alf Hiltebeitel]], the Mahabharata is essentially mythological.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2005|p=5594}} Indian historian [[Upinder Singh]] has written that:
 
{{quote|Whether a bitter war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas ever happened cannot be proved or disproved. It is possible that there was a small-scale conflict, transformed into a gigantic epic war by bards and poets. Some historians and archaeologists have argued that this conflict may have occurred in about 1000 BCE."{{sfn|Singh|2009||p=19}}}}

Despite the inconclusiveness of the data, attempts have been made to assign a historical date to the Kurukshetra War. Popular tradition holds that the war marks the transition to [[Kaliyuga]] and thus dates it to 3102 BCE.{{cn|date=August 2016}} A number of other proposals have been put forward:{{cn|date=August 2016}}
* P. V. [[Vartak]] calculates a date of October 16, 5561 BCE using planetary positions. 
* P. V. Holey states a date of 13 November 3143 BCE using planetary positions and calendar systems.

==Yugas==
The Puranas contain stories about the creation of the world, and the [[yugas]]. There are four yugas in one cycle:
* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'', a time of truth and righteousness;
* ''[[Treta Yuga]]''
* ''[[Dvapara Yuga]]''
* ''[[Kali Yuga]]'', a time of darkness and non-virtue.

According to the [[Manusmṛti|Manusmriti]], one of the earliest known texts describing the yugas, the length is 4800 years + 3600 years + 2400 years + 1200 years, for a total of 12,000 years for one arc, or 24,000 years to complete the cycle, which is one precession of the equinox). These 4 yugas follow a timeline ratio of (4:3:2:1).

According to [[Bhagavata Purana|Bhagavata]] Purana 3.11.19, which is dated at 500-1000 CE, the yugas are much longer, namely 1,728,000 years, 1,296,000 years, 864,000 years and 432,000 years

==Indigenous Aryans - '10,000 years in India' ==

===Indigenous Aryans===
{{Main article|Indigenous Aryans}}

The Vedic-Puranic chronology has been referred to by proponents of [[Indigenous Aryans]], putting into question the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryan migrations]] at ca. 1500 BCE and proposing older dates for the Vedic period. According to the "Indigenist position", the Aryans are indigenous to India,{{sfn|Trautman|2005|p=xxx}} and the Indo-European languages radiated out from a homeland in India into their present locations.{{sfn|Trautman|2005|p=xxx}} According to them, the Vedas are older than second millennium BCE,{{sfn|Trautman|2005|p=xxviii}} and scriptures like the Mahabaratha reflect historical events which took place before 1500 BCE. Some of them equate the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Saraswati Civilisation]] with the [[Vedic Civilization]],{{sfn|Trautman|2005|p=xxx}} state that the Indus script was the progenitor of the [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramasami|first1=Jeyakumar|title=Indus Script Based on Sanskrit Language|url=http://www.sci-news.com/othersciences/linguistics/science-indus-script-sanskrit-language-01777.html|website=Sci News|publisher=Sci News|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and state that there is no difference between the people living in (northern) Indo-European part and the (southern) Dravidian part.{{sfn|Trautman|2005|p=xxviii}} 

==='10,000 years in India'===
{{See also|8th millennium BC}}

The idea of "Indigenous Aryanism" fits into traditional Hindu ideas about their religion, namely that it has timeless origins, with the Vedic Aryans inhabiting India since ancient times.{{refn|group=note|The Vedic Foundation states: "The history of Bharatvarsh (which is now called India) is the description of the timeless glory of the Divine dignitaries who not only Graced the soils of India with their presence and Divine intelligence, but they also showed and revealed the true path of peace, happiness and the Divine enlightenment for the souls of the world that still is the guideline for the true lovers of God who desire to taste the sweetness of His Divine love in an intimate style."&lt;ref group=web name="VF-Intro" /&gt;}} 

[[M.S. Golwalkar]], in his 1939 publication ''[[We or Our Nationhood Defined]]'', famously stated that "Undoubtedly [...] we — Hindus — have been in undisputed and undisturbed possession of this land for over eight or even ten thousand years before the land was invaded by any foreign race."&lt;ref&gt;Gyanendra Pandey (2006), ''Routine Violence: Nations, Fragments, Histories'', Stanford University Press, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; Golwalkar was inspired by Tilak's{{refn|group=note|Carol Schaeffer: "Tilak, dubbed the “father of Indian unrest” for his advocacy of violent tactics against British colonialists and inspiration to later Indian Hindu nationalists".&lt;ref name="Schaeffer"/&gt;}} ''[[The Arctic Home in the Vedas]]'' (1903), who argued that the Aryan homeland was located at the North Pole, basing this idea on Vedic hymns and Zoroastrian texts.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer"/&gt; Gowalkar took over the idea of 10,000 years, arguing that the North Pole at that time was located in India.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer"&gt;Carol Schaeffer (2018), [http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/unholy-alliance-india-white-supremacy ''Alt-Reich.

[[Subhash Kak]], a main proponent of the "indigenist position," underwrites the Vedic-Puranic chronology, and uses it to recalculate the dates of the Vedas and the Vedic people.{{sfn|Kak|1987}}{{sfn|Kak|1996}}&lt;ref group=web name="Kak-Astronomy" /&gt; According to Kak, "the Indian civilization must be viewed as an unbroken tradition that goes back to the earliest period of the Sindhu-Sarasvati (or Indus) tradition (7000 or 8000 BC)."{{sfn|Kak|1987}} According to Sudhir Bhargava, the Vedas were composed 10,000 years ago, when [[Manusmriti|Manu]] supposedly lived, in ashrams at the banks of the [[Sarasvati river]] in Brahmavarta, the ancient home-base of the [[Aryans]]. According to Sudhir Bhargava, people from Brahmavarta moved out from Brahmavarta into and outside India after 4500 BCE, when seismic activities had changed the course of the Sarasvati and other rivers.&lt;ref&gt;sanskritimagazine.com, [https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/india/brahmavarta-land-aryans-located/ ''Brahmavarta,  the land of Aryans located'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pranab Saikia (May 7, 2018), [https://www.socialpost.news/lifestyle/exploring-the-brahmavarta-the-land-of-aryans/?fromNewsdog=1&amp;utm_source=NewsDog&amp;utm_medium=referral ''Exploring The Brahmavarta, The Land Of Aryans''], socialpost.news&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of 10,000 years of Hindu presence in South Asia stands in stark contrast to mainstream scholarship, according to which proto-Vedic culture entered India starting 1500 BCE with the [[Indo-Aryan migrations]], and Hinduism developed as a synthesis of Vedic-Brahmanic and indigenous religious traditions after 500 BCE.

The early relationship between Samaritans and Christianity is murky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meier|first1=John P.|title=The Historical Jesus and the Historical Samaritans: What can be Said?|journal=Biblica|date=2000|volume=81| issue =  2|page=217|url=http://jstor.org/stable/42614262|publisher=GBPress}}. It can be accessed freely online [https://www.bsw.org/biblica/vol-81-2000/the-historical-jesus-and-the-historical-samaritans-what-can-be-said/285/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the New Testament book of Acts, [[Philip the Evangelist]] conducted a mission in Samaria and significantly increased the number of Christian believers there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acts 8:4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the apostolic visitation of Peter and John, who were sent by the elders in Jerusalem to lay hands upon the baptized Samaritans so that they would receive the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acts 8:14-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the second century CE, the original Samaritan Christian community had disbanded and was lost to history. A few scholars, like Dr. Ze’ev Goldmann, believe that Samaritan Christianity continued on for some time thereafter, and argue that “Samaritan Neo-Christians” had moved to Capernaum and had adopted the use of the [[pelta]] (shield) symbol as a representative sign, having a function similar to the Jewish [[star of David]], which can be seen at several archaeological sites associated with them. 

== Role of Samaritans in Christianity ==
From the story of the [[Samaritan woman at the well]] to the [[parable of the Good Samaritan]], Samaritans were very much a part of [[Early Christianity]]. Jesus, however, championed the underdog. While he instructed his disciples not to go to the Samaritans, he dealt with the Samaritans directly, and referenced them in his teachings.

=== Prochorus ===
A nephew of Stephen and one of the original [[Seven Deacons]] of the Jerusalem Church, [[Prochorus]] played an important role in the development of early Christianity among Jewish and Samaritan converts. After his uncle's martyrdom, Roman and Jewish violence toward Christians increased and eventually led to the dispersion of the Christian community at Jerusalem. Christian tradition holds that Prochorus gave aid to the Apostle Peter in his mission work and went on to become a close companion and personal scribe for the Apostle John, penning various letters and books for him, including his Gospel and his Revelation. Prochorus met a martyr's death in Antioch at the end of the first century AD.

=== Later Samaritan Christians and modern revival efforts ===

Nothing of the original Samaritan Christian community remains, but Samaritans continued to convert to Christianity at different times during the centuries that followed the spread of Christianity throughout Rome. A great number of conversions were forced on account of persecution, which ultimately led to the assimilation and disappearance of the Byzantine Samaritan diaspora and the near annihilation of Samaritans in the Levant.

[[File:Our Lady of Lourdes Basilica.jpg|thumb|320px|right|The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]]

The '''Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes''' or the '''Domain''' (as it is most commonly known) is an area of ground surrounding the Catholic shrine ('''Grotto''') to [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in the town of [[Lourdes]], France. The Sanctuary is a destination for [[pilgrimage]]; [[Disease|sick]] pilgrims are reputed to be miraculously healed by Lourdes water. This ground is owned and administrated by the Roman Catholic Church, and has several functions, including devotional activities, offices, and accommodation for sick pilgrims and their helpers. The Domain includes the Grotto itself, the nearby taps which dispense the [[Lourdes water]], and the offices of the [[Lourdes Medical Bureau]], as well as several churches and basilicas. It comprises an area of 51 hectares, and includes 22 separate places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lourdes-france.org/index.php?goto_centre=ru&amp;contexte=en&amp;id=431&amp;id_rubrique=431|title=Lourdes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are six official languages of the Sanctuary: French, English, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and German.

Grottos intended as replicas of the one at Our Lady of Lourdes, and other grottos in honour of Our Lady of Lourdes, are often described as "[[Lourdes grotto]]s".

==History==
Beginning on 11 February 1858, a 14-year-old peasant girl named [[Bernadette Soubirous]] claimed to have experienced a series of apparitions of a girl dressed in white and with a blue belt around her waist, who eventually introduced herself as the [[Our Lady of Lourdes|Immaculate Conception]], a name by which the [[BVM(RC)|Virgin Mary]] was known.

On land bordered by a loop of the [[Gave de Pau]] river is an outcrop of rock called '''Massabielle''', (from ''masse vieille'': "old mass"). On the northern aspect of this rock, near the river bank, is a naturally occurring, irregularly shaped shallow cave or [[grotto]], in which the apparitions took place.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Harris, ''Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age'', Penguin Books, 1999, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the apparitions, the grotto lay well outside town, on common ground which was used by the villagers variously for pasturing animals, collecting firewood, and as a garbage dump, and it had a reputation for being an unpleasant place.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Harris, ''Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age'', Penguin Books, 1999, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Roman Catholic Mariology}}
The figure always appeared in one place, a [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] above the main cavity of the grotto, in which a wild rose bush was growing. Among the instructions from 'the Virgin' were "Go and drink from the spring", "Go and tell the priests to build a chapel here", and "Have the people come here in procession". These three instructions in particular were to prove pivotal in the development of the Domain and its ceremonies.

Public interest in the apparitions grew, and curious visitors began to be replaced by pilgrims from increasingly far away, drawn by compelling stories of apparitions and miracles.

A local [[Catholic priest|priest]], '''Abbé [[Dominique Peyramale]]''', together with his bishop, '''Monsignor Bertrand-Sévère Mascarou Laurence''', bought the grotto and the land around it from the [[commune in France|commune]] in 1861, 3 years after the apparitions. Immediately they set about modifying the area to make it more accessible to visitors, and started work to build the first of the churches, which is now known as the '''Crypt'''.

In 1864, the [[Lyon]]nais sculptor '''[[Joseph-Hugues Fabisch]]''' was commissioned to create a statue of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] based on Bernadette's descriptions. Although it has become an iconic symbol of Our Lady of Lourdes, it depicts a figure which is not only older and taller than Bernadette's description, but also more in keeping with orthodox and traditional representations of the Virgin Mary. The statue rests in the niche where the Virgin appeared to Bernadette. The original wild rose bush was destroyed shortly after the apparitions by pilgrims seeking relics, but a newer one has been planted nearby.&lt;ref name="OliverTodd"&gt;Oliver Todd, ''The Lourdes Pilgrim'', Matthew James Publishing, 2003, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to French political upheaval resulting in an enforced separation of Church and State, the property and grounds of the Domain were confiscated from the Church and returned to the ownership of the town in 1910. The then bishop, Mgr. François-Xavier Schoepfer, contested this confiscation and was permitted to rent the Domain from the town until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914.&lt;ref name="RuthHarris"&gt;Ruth Harris, ''Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age'', Penguin Books, 1999, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, a visit to Lourdes by [[Philippe Pétain|Marshal Pétain]] in 1941 provided official recognition of the Domain. Church officials successfully petitioned Pétain to allow the Church to reclaim ownership of the Domain.&lt;ref name="RuthHarris" /&gt;

==Administration==
[[Image:Lourdes ND Rosaire 03.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, commonly known as the Upper Basilica, Lourdes.]]
The [[Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes]] is responsible for the spiritual governance of the Domain. He appoints a local representative, who is called the Rector. The Domain is run independently of the parish of Lourdes, which is responsible for the spiritual needs of the Lourdais themselves.

Thirty full-time chaplains work in the Domain, from [[diocese]]s and religious communities worldwide. {{As of|2010|}} there were 292 full-time lay employees and a further 120 seasonal employees working in 63 different divisions, with an annual running budget of €18 million, 90% from donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lourdes-france.org/index.php?goto_centre=ru&amp;contexte=en&amp;id=431&amp;id_rubrique=431|title=Lourdes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Domain is open all year round. In winter there are many fewer visitors, a reduced timetable of services and devotional activity, and no processions. The winter season runs from 1 November (the feast of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]]) until Easter.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Todd, ''The Lourdes Pilgrim'', Matthew James Publishing, 2003, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February, the Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes, a full programme of activities usually takes place.

The Domain is fully active between Easter and All Saints each year, and has a programme of devotional activities including [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], processions (see below), [[Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament]], and the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Sacrament of Reconciliation]]. Many activities are carried out in several languages; in some services the [[liturgy]] is repeated in different languages.

The grounds are open daily from 5&amp;nbsp;am until midnight;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Todd, ''The Lourdes Pilgrim'', Matthew James Publishing, 2003, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; outside these times the Grotto is accessible via the Lacets Gate behind the Upper Basilica.

An estimated 200 million people have visited the shrine since 1860 [http://www.sacredsites.com/europe/france/lourdes.html]. The Roman Catholic Church has officially recognized 70 miracle healings, the 70th of which was the cure of Sister Bernadette Moriau, recognised on February 11, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.catholicherald.com/News/National___International/70th_official_miraculous_healing_at_Lourdes/&lt;/ref&gt;

About 800 tonnes of wax is burnt annually in devotional candles.&lt;ref name="OliverTodd" /&gt;

The Domain publishes the monthly ''Lourdes News'', with news and featured articles about the Domain and Lourdes generally.

==Lourdes water==
{{Main article|Lourdes water}}
Lourdes water flows from a [[spring (hydrology)|spring]] at the same spot where it was discovered by [[Bernadette Soubirous|Bernadette]]. The original spring can be seen within the Grotto, lit from below and protected by a glass screen. Pilgrims drink Lourdes water due to its reputed healing power. The water is accessed from individual tap located between the grotto and the baths, The water from Lourdes was thoroughly analysed by independent chemists in 1858 and 1859, and does not appear to have a latent power to cure and has no special [[Science|scientific]] or [[Medication|medicinal]] properties. Despite this, the water is itself a strong symbol of devotion for Lourdes pilgrims, and many buy statues and [[rosary beads]] containing small vials of it, and take home large plastic containers of it.

===Baths===
Each year about 350,000 pilgrims bathe in the water at the baths (''Piscines)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lourdes-france.org/index.php?goto_centre=ru&amp;contexte=en&amp;id=434|title=Lourdes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the pilgrimage season, the baths are open 8:30 am –12:30 pm / 1:30 – 6:00 pm on weekdays and 10.00 am-12.00 noon / 2.00 pm-4.00 pm Sundays and Holidays,

==Processions==
Processions are held in the Domain, with the Torchlight Procession being perhaps the best-known and most visually impressive

===Blessed Sacrament procession===
The '''Blessed Sacrament procession''' is held daily at 5:00 pm. The procession begins at the open-air altar on the prairie across the river from the grotto and is led by sick pilgrims followed by a priest, bishop or cardinal carrying a [[monstrance]] containing the [[Blessed Sacrament]]. Typically the bearer of the Blessed Sacrament is sheltered from the elements by a mobile awning/canopy, called a [[baldachin]], carried by four assistants. The Blessed Sacrament is accompanied by bearers carrying candles, incense burners or other devotional symbols. These bearers are lay helpers chosen from the pilgrimages. Following directly behind the Blessed Sacrament, both during the procession and the Blessing of the Sick, will be a representative group of doctors from the various pilgrimages. Lastly, there are groups of pilgrims, some following their parish or diocesan banner. The procession makes its way across the river, past the Crowned Statue, along the esplanade and down into the St. Pius X underground basilica where the sick pilgrims are placed at the front of the altar. During the procession there are meditations, prayers, hymns and chants, in several languages. When all the participants have assembled, there is a period of Eucharistic Adoration, followed by the Blessing of the Sick.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Todd, ''The Lourdes Pilgrim'', Matthew James Publishing, 2003, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During extreme weather conditions, the procession will take place inside the basilica.

===Torchlight Procession===
[[Image:Bas at night.jpg|right|thumb|210px|Rosary Basilica at night, looking across Rosary Square during the Torchlight Procession]]
The '''Torchlight Marian Procession''' takes place daily at 9.00pm. It begins near the Grotto and continues around the esplanade ending in the Rosary square. In extreme weather an indoor ceremony may be held in the Underground Basilica instead. The procession is led by sick pilgrims followed by volunteers carrying a replica of the '''Cabuchet Statue''' of the Virgin Mary. Most participants carry a candle.

The focus of this procession is the [[rosary]]. All five decades are recited, usually in a variety of languages. The Lourdes Hymn is also sung, with verses in different languages. Intercessions may be invoked followed by the ''Laudate Mariam''. There is a final blessing in Latin, and then an invitation to exchange the '''[[Sign of peace]]''' with fellow pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Todd, ''The Lourdes Pilgrim'', Matthew James Publishing, 2003, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main churches of the Domain==

===Crypt===
The '''Crypt''' was the first of the churches to be completed in the Domain, and is today among the smallest. Construction was started by Abbé Peyramale and Mgr. Laurence. Bernadette's father worked on its construction and was present at its official opening, on [[Pentecost]] Sunday, 1866.

The [[nave]] is small and a notable feature as are the enormous pillars which support the weight of the Upper Basilica, which was constructed on top of it.

The Crypt is entered along a corridor, whose entrance is dominated by a large bronze statue of [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]], holding the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. Opposite stands a statue of [[Pope Pius X|Pius X]]. The walls of the corridor and nave are lined with small marble plaques, known as ''ex voto'' plaques, donated in thanks of spiritual favours received.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Todd, ''The Lourdes Pilgrim'', Matthew James Publishing, 2003, p. 42-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper Basilica===
{{Main article|Notre-Dame de l’Immaculee-Conception, Lourdes|l1=Notre-Dame de l’Immaculee Conception}}
The '''[[Basilica]] of the Immaculate Conception''', known widely as the '''Upper Basilica''', was the second of the churches to be completed, consecrated in 1876. It is an impressive, elaborate building in Gothic style, designed by architect [[Hyppolyte Durand]], and on one side seems to emerge directly from the rock of Massabielle (the sanctuary is directly above the Grotto). The walls are lined with ''ex voto'' plaques, and banners from official National Pilgrimages of the past. It has a series of stained-glass windows depicting various events in the story of Lourdes; the [[clerestory]] windows depict Mary as the Second [[Eve]].

The exterior is dominated by a 70m [[spire]], and two lesser spires (not completed until 1908). Above the entrance is a [[mosaic]] depicting [[Pope Pius IX]], who defined the dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Todd, ''The Lourdes Pilgrim'', Matthew James Publishing, 2003, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosary Basilica===
{{Main article|Rosary Basilica}}
The '''Rosary Basilica''' is the third of the churches to be completed, in 1899 and designed by architect Leopold Hardy. It was consecrated in 1901 and has a capacity of 1,500 worshippers. Its style is influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]]. The nave is open and circular, surmounted by a dome. The exterior of the dome is surmounted by a dramatic gilded crown and cross, which were a gift from the people of Ireland in 1924.

The exterior facade of the basilica was modified in 2007 to include a depiction of the '''Luminous Mysteries''', which are not a part of traditional fifteen, but another rosary, by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2002.

===Crowned Statue and Rosary Square===
[[Image:RosarySquare.jpg|thumb|left|Looking out onto ''Rosary Square'' from the roof of the Basilica]]
The open space in front of the Rosary Basilica is known as '''Rosary Square'''.

The entrances to the Crypt and the Upper Basilica, both of which are built on top of Massabielle, are far above ground level. To facilitate access, two enormous ramps were constructed, which curve down either side of Rosary Square. The image of the entrance of the Rosary Basilica, flanked by the two ramps and surmounted by the spires of the Upper Basilica, has become one of the iconic symbols of Lourdes, and a stylised form of this image has been adopted by the Domain itself as its logo.

The '''Statue of the Crowned Virgin''', often known as the "Crowned Statue" (French: ''La Vierge Couronnée''), stands across Rosary Square from the Rosary Basilica and faces the entrance. This prominent statue is a familiar landmark and a traditional meeting point. The statue is 2.5m high and cast in [[bronze]], painted white and blue in the traditional colours. Her rosary is of the [[Birgittine]] style and incorporates six decades.&lt;ref name="OliverTodd" /&gt;

Behind the Crowned Statue is the '''Esplanade''', a large open walkway which is used for the processions.{{clear}}

===Underground Basilica===

{{Main article|Basilica of St. Pius X}}
The '''Basilica of St. Pius X''', known as the '''Underground Basilica''', is the largest and most controversial of the Domain's churches. It was designed by the architect [[Pierre Vago]] and completed in 1958 in anticipation of the enormous crowds expected in Lourdes for the centenary of the Apparitions. A modern, concrete building, it is almost entirely underground (part of the building lies beneath the Boulevard Père Rémi Sempé above). When full it can accommodate 25,000 worshippers.

===Church of St. Bernadette===
The most recent of the major centres of worship is the '''Church of St. Bernadette''', which was consecrated in 1988. It was built opposite the Grotto across the River, on the spot where Bernadette stood during the final (18th) [[Our Lady of Lourdes|Apparition]].

The Church of St. Bernadette is a modern building with comparatively little adornment. It was designed to allow as much natural light as possible into the nave, and light-coloured materials have been used, making it noticeably brighter than the Underground Basilica. It was designed by the architect [[Jean-Paul Felix]].

It is also a more versatile building. The nave has provision for 5,000 seated worshippers and 350 wheelchairs, but partitions can be drawn which divide the nave into smaller sections. In addition, it includes the '''Hemicycle''', a large lecture room which may be used for worship, and an assortment of conference rooms and smaller rooms which may be used for devotional or non-devotional activity.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Todd, ''The Lourdes Pilgrim'', Matthew James Publishing, 2003, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapel of Reconciliation===
The '''Chapel of Reconciliation''' formerly occupied a site slightly more remote, at the entrance of the Upper [[Stations of the Cross]]. It was moved several years ago into a more prominent position, into the building previously known as the '''Accueil Notre Dame''', near the Crowned Statue and facing the Esplanade.

The Chapel of Reconciliation is somewhat unusual in that no [[Mass (liturgy)|masses]] or other services take place there; instead it is given over entirely to the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Sacrament of Reconciliation]]. Priests from different countries observe a duty roster, which means that, at almost any time of day, pilgrims from Europe (and occasionally further away) can find a priest who will hear their confession in their own language.

===St. Joseph's Chapel===
'''St. Joseph's Chapel''' is situated at the far end of the Esplanade, near St. Michael's Gate. It is a modern, concrete church, mostly underground, with little natural light. It was also designed by [[Pierre Vago]], and was consecrated on 1 May 1968. It has provision for 450 seated worshippers and 80 wheelchairs.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Todd, ''The Lourdes Pilgrim'', Matthew James Publishing, 2003, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grotto ==
[[Image:Grotte Massabielle.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The Grotto of Massabielle]]
In contrast to the grandness of Rosary Square and the various basilicas, the grotto at Massabielle where St Bernadette's visions took place is very simple and stark. The recess of the grotto itself is undecorated, although a plain stone altar and lectern have been placed there so that Mass can be celebrated. Above the main recess is the niche where the apparitions took place and Fabisch's statue now stands. A large stand of candles next to the altar is kept burning throughout the year. During the pilgrimage season, 2 pilgrimage masses are usually celebrated each morning at the grotto.

The spring Bernadette is said to have dug can be seen at the rear of the grotto, shielded by a glass cover. When Mass is not being celebrated, pilgrims can process through the grotto where it is traditional to touch the rocks directly under the statue; indeed so many people have done this that the stones have become polished. Also at the rear of the grotto is a metal box into which written prayers or petitions may be deposited; they are collected daily and burnt.

Rows of benches allow visitors to sit and [[prayer|pray]] or contemplate. Pilgrims are asked to remain silent while in the vicinity to create an atmosphere of devotion. One of the spots where Bernadette prayed to the Virgin is marked by a special paving slab.

Some of the rock walls around the grotto bear clear signs of deliberate alteration, presumably to improve access for pilgrims. It is therefore no longer clear what the original configuration of the grotto was.

At least one contemporary account describes a series of chambers behind the statue's niche, which can only be reached by climbing "like a lizard" through clefts in the rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Harris, ''Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age'', Penguin Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accueils and hospitals==
[[Image:Accueil Notre Dame.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The Accueil Notre Dame]]
Across the river from the grotto and the churches is the '''Accueil Notre Dame''', a modern facility built in 1996 to house sick pilgrims during their time in Lourdes.

The Accueil Notre Dame was built to replace the two older Accueils that were present within the Domain. The old Accueil Notre Dame stood opposite the Underground Basilica, and has been extensively remodelled, being divided into two buildings by removing a section. One building now contains the Chapel of Reconciliation, which used to be the refectory, and also houses the convent of the [[Sisters of Charity of Nevers]]. The other section is now known as the '''Accueil John Paul II''', and contains several chapels (e.g. St Cosmos &amp; St Damien), the First Aid post and Dispensary, and the offices of the Hospitalité. The other was the '''Accueil St. Bernadette''', which stood across the river from the old Accueil Notre Dame, and was demolished to make way for the new one.

Since Easter 1997 sick pilgrims from all over the world have been housed in the Accueil Notre Dame, an airy modern building. The Accueil is organised into two wings, each consisting of six storeys, with the Reception area on the ground floor and the Transit Lounge on the fifth. Each floor from one to four is named after a specific saint, with female saints honoured on one side and male ones on the other. Each floor has a central [[refectory]] area where pilgrims congregate to eat.

The rooms, each with bathroom and shower, accommodate from one to six people. Each room has a window, with some fortunate ones having a view of the Grotto, and storage cupboards and a table and chairs. Each room opens onto a communal area.

Linking the two sides is the Administration Area, with two panoramic lifts bringing visitors to each floor. The administration offices are on the sixth and seventh floors, and there are kitchens for each side.

Typically, pilgrims arrive at the Accueil Notre Dame in specially adapted buses, either from Lourdes airport or train station, and will be welcomed in the transit lounge from where they are taken to their rooms. 

Another accueil, the '''Accueil Marie St. Frai''', is located a short distance outside the domain; it is similar in design and atmosphere to the Accueil Notre Dame.

==''Prairie''==
Across the Gave from the Grotto is a wide, open, uncluttered space covered with grass and known in French as the ''prairie'', or in English, the meadow.

In the corner of the ''prairie'' is the tent-like '''Chapel of Adoration''', consecrated in 1995 and given over entirely to [[veneration]] of the [[Blessed Sacrament]], There is also an open-air altar for outdoor ceremonies. 

Also on the prairie is a series of candle holders called 'brulières' where pilgrims can place candles of varying sizes. Some pilgrimages transport large candles from their respective parishes. The brulières are tended by ''feutiers'', attendants whose job is to ensure candles are burnt safely and evenly and to remove the trays of melted wax which collects under each brulière.
 
In 2002 the '''Water Walk''' was introduced, across the Gave and slightly downstream from the Grotto. It consists of a series of nine stations at which there is a small Lourdes water font.

[[Image:Bruliere.jpg|thumb|220px|right|A typical brulière full of devotional candles]]

==Scepticism and criticism==
Since the earliest of the Lourdes apparitions, there has been intense debate regarding their veracity. The earliest investigators, including the priest Abbé [[Dominique Peyramale]] and the Chief of Police, Dominique Jacomet, were both initially convinced they were dealing with a [[hoax]] (both later changed their minds), and several researchers have since called several aspects of the Lourdes phenomenon into question.

The apparitions at Lourdes took place against the backdrop of a rich network of popular piety, which was common throughout the Pyrenean region in the 19th century. In the decades leading up to 1858, several children in small Pyrenean villages (on both sides of the border) claimed to see apparitions of the Virgin Mary in remote locations. Many consider that Bernadette was simply repeating a well-tried trick to gain attention and notoriety. Believers argue that this is not likely, since Bernadette claimed the Lady called herself "the Immaculate Conception", referring to a doctrine formally established only four years previously, and which Soubirous may not have been familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Saint_Bernadette_Soubirous.html?id=h4Q9AAAAYAAJ |title=Saint Bernadette Soubirous:1844-1879 |author=Francis Trochu |publisher=Pantheon |pages=156–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Lourdes contains many souvenir shops. Some visitors may dislike the commercialism of parts of Lourdes, with neon-emblazoned shops overflowing with what [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], a supporter of the shrine, called "tawdry [[relic]]s, the bric-a-brac of piety".&lt;ref&gt;Muggeridge contrasts the ''"tawdry relics, the bric-a-brac of piety"'' with the spiritual phenomena he describes experiencing in Lourdes. (''Jesus Rediscovered'', A Visit To Lourdes, Fontana 1969.[http://www.worldinvisible.com/library/mugridge/jred/jredch14.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Lourdes has been called the "Disneyland of the Catholic Church". Critics argue that the Lourdes phenomenon is nothing more than a significant money-spinner for the town and the region, which therefore has a strong vested interest in keeping the pilgrims coming.&lt;ref&gt;''"Consuming Visions—Mass Culture and the Lourdes Shrine, Suzanne Kaufman"'', Book reviewed by Lawrence S. Cunningham [[University of Notre Dame]], Commonweal 23 September 2005.[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Religion+Booknotes-a0137089781]&lt;/ref&gt; The church, however, distances itself from commercialisation. The many [[wikt:trinket|trinket]] stalls are privately owned, and [[hawker (trade)|hawker]]s are strictly forbidden inside the sanctuary.

Many people remain sceptical about Lourdes and its supposed healing power, arguing that any improvement offered by the shrine is no more than the [[placebo effect]], and that the ceremonies and processions are no better than faith-healing on a grand scale.

==Similar history as Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico==
The origin of this large church complex inspired by a vision in France is similar to the origin of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in Mexico. [[Bernadette Soubirous]]'s vision of 1858 which gave rise to the growth of [[Lourdes]] is similar to the case of [[Juan Diego]]'s vision in 1531 in Mexico. Both saints reported visions in which a miraculous lady on a hill asked them to request that the local priests build a chapel at the site of the vision. Both visions had a reference to roses. Like [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in France, [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] is a major Catholic symbol in Mexico and the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] complex is one of the largest and most visited Catholic churches in the Americas, but does not have the specific reputation for healing that Lourdes has.

{{hinduism}}
'''Shyama Sangeet''' ({{lang-bn|শ্যামা সঙ্গীত }}) is a genre of [[Bengali language|Bengali]] devotional songs dedicated to the Hindu goddess Shyama or [[Kali]] which is a form of supreme universal mother-goddess Durga or parvati. It is also known as Shaktagiti or Durgastuti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shyamasangit|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shyamasangit|publisher=Banglapedia|accessdate=25 February 2012|last1=Khan|first1=Md Sayeed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shyama Sangeet appeals to the common man because it is a musical representation of the relationship of eternal and sublime love and care between the mother and her child. It is free of the common rituals of worship and also the esoteric practice of the [[Tantra]].

==Origin==

During the 12th-13th centuries when [[Shaktism]] grew in Bengal, it inspired a number of poets to compose poems on Kali.
Mukundarāma, known as Kavikaṅkaṇ or 'gem of poets, ' wrote his chief poem, the epic Chaṇḍī, in 1589. Towards the middle of the 18th century, the poet [[Ramprasad Sen]] instilled new life into it and turned it into a distinct genre of Bengali songs.

Ramprasad was succeeded by number of composers like Kamlakanta Bhattacharya (1772–1821), Rasikchandra Ray (1820–1893), Ramchandra Datta (1861–1899), and Nilakantha Mukhopadhyaya. In modern times both [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] have composed poems of Shyama Sangeet genre.

The term 'Shyama' refers to the skin color of Kali (usually depicted in black or deep blue.) Literally, it means dusky.

==Divisions==

Shyamasangeet can be divided into two streams: devotional or metaphysical and ''Durgastuti'', ''Umasangit'', ''Agamani'' or ''Vijaya'' songs. The first category of songs is inspired by devotion and spiritual thoughts. The second category which is based on themes of daily family matters or social events, is known as ''Padavali'', ''Umasangit'', ''Agamani'' or ''Vijaya'' songs.

==Popularity==

Shyama Sangeet conceptualizes Goddess Kali as a loving human mother and the singer is longing for The Mother’s love. The songs have become popular not only for its devotional side, but also for its human appeal.

The theme and occasion of Āgāmanī and Vijayā songs are as follows. Parvati (Umā or Gaurī), daughter of Himālaya and Menakā, was married to Śiva, the Lord of Kailāsa. Parvati as the form of  Goddess Durga (the supreme universal mother-goddess) comes to see her parents from her in laws every year. The goddess is portrayed here as an ordinary girl living far away from her mother and feels joyous to come back home after a long stay at her in laws’ place. These songs too are highly popular because of their human appeal and as they are easily identifiable with any married girl living far away from their parents.

What Edward Thompson wrote in 1923 is true even today.
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;
But the Śākta poems are a different matter. These have gone to the heart of a people as few poets' work has done. Such songs as the exquisite 'This day will surely pass, Mother, this day will pass,' I have heard from coolies on the road or workers in the paddy fields; I have heard it by broad rivers at sunset, when the parrots were flying to roost and the village folk thronging from marketing to the ferry. Once I asked the top class in a mofussil high school to write out a song of Rabindranath Tagore's; two boys out of forty succeeded, a result which I consider showed the very real diffusion of his songs. But, when I asked for a song of Rāmprasād's, every boy except two responded. Truly, a poet who is known both by work and name to boys between fourteen and eighteen, is a national poet. Tagore's songs are heard in Calcutta streets, and have been widely spread by the student community and the Brahmo Samaj; but in the villages of Bengal they are unknown, while Rāmprasād's are heard everywhere. 'The peasants and the paṇḍits enjoy his songs equally. They draw solace from them in the hour of despair and even at the moment of death. The dying man brought to the banks of the Ganges asks his companions to sing Rāmprasādī songs.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Edward. J. and Spencer, Arthur Marshman, Bengali Religious Lyrics, Śākta, Oxford University Press, London, 1923. p 19&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shayama sangeet become more popular at the time of Sri Ramkrishna Paramahansa, who was an ardent Kali bhakta/devotee. Ramprasad Sen, Rabindranath Thakur/Tagore, Girishchandra Ghosh, and Swami Vivekananda, among others, composed numerous Shyama Sangeet.  India's national song, 'Vande Maataram'/'Hail to the Mother', whose lyrics were written by Bankimchandra Chatterjee/Chattopadhyay and whose music was composed by Thakur/TagOre, is first and foremost a hymn to Ma [[Durga]] which hails the Indian motherland, "Bharat Mata", as being a form of the supreme goddess Durga. Rabindranath Thakur/Tagore's 'Jana Gana Mana', the Indian national anthem, contains a line, "Snehamayee tumi mata", which literally means India is a loving mother ("Bharat mata")... Rabindranath Thakur/Tagore also composed a song which was later picked to be the national anthem of Bangladesh ('[[Amar Sonar Bangla]]'/'My golden Bengal') in which he refers to the entirety of Bengal (undivided Bengal; the song was written before the partition of West Bengal and Bangladesh) as being a segment of the body of the supreme mother.

'''Tapestry crochet''' is sometimes called '''jacquard crochet''', '''intarsia''', '''mosaic''', '''fair isle''', and '''colorwork''', but today these terms usually describe different techniques. Since the yarns are switched back and forth to create motifs,&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Carol (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; tapestry crochet fabric looks more like it was woven on a loom than crocheted with a hook.

==Methods==

Just as there are several ways to produce a woven [[tapestry]], so there are different ways to do tapestry crochet. Most tapestry crochet is done with single [[crochet]] stitches, but the slip stitch, half double, and double crochet stitches are also used. Yarns not in play are either carried inside the stitches, dropped and picked up when needed (also called intarsia), or they run along the back of the stitches.

The crochet hook may be inserted under both top loops or under one loop (also called [[Fair Isle]] crochet); colors may be changed before the stitch is completed or afterwards, all of which produce different results. Tight stitches produce a stiff fabric with hidden carried colors, while loose stitches show the carried colors and produce a fabric with drape.

Some fibers may be loosely tapestry crocheted, then [[felt]]ed in a washing machine – resulting in a dense fabric patterned on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Ventura, Carol (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

With bead tapestry crochet, beads of the same color are strung onto individual yarns. To produce the motifs, yarns are switched and beads are placed on some or all of the stitches.&lt;ref&gt;Ventura, Carol (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Maya peoples|Maya]] men in [[Guatemala]] tapestry crochet shoulder bags with recognizable regional patterns for local use with single crochet stitches, inserting the hook under both top loops. Both women and men there tapestry crochet bags, hats, and hacky sacks for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;Ventura, Carol (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hats are tapestry crocheted by both men and women in [[Africa]], such as in [[Ghana]]. The shape, color, and design can denote social position or ethnic affiliation or may simply be a fashion statement. In order to make the fabric stiffer, extra fibers are sometimes carried along with the yarn or the hat may be starched.

Tapestry crocheted [[yarmulke]] (also called kippah) are worn by [[Jewish]] men. These skullcaps are usually decorated with either geometric or figurative motifs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13958">A '''Torah database''' (מאגר תורני or מאגר יהדות) is an electronic collection of classic [[Jewish]] texts in electronic form, the kinds of texts which especially in [[Israel]] are often called [[Judaism#Jewish literature|"The Traditional Jewish Bookshelf"]] (ארון הספרים היהודי); the texts are in their original languages ([[Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic]]). These databases contain either keyed-in digital texts or a collection of page-images from printed editions. Given the nature of traditional Jewish [[Torah study]], which involves extensive citation and cross-referencing among hundreds of texts written over the course of thousands of years, many Torah databases also make extensive use of [[hypertext]] links.

A '''Torah database''' usually refers to a collection of primary texts, rather than translations or secondary research and reference materials.

==Digital Text Software Packages==

===The Bar-Ilan Responsa Project===
The very first such database was the [[Bar Ilan Responsa Project]], which began in 1963 at the [[Weizmann Institute]] in Israel, migrated to [[Bar-Ilan University]] soon thereafter, and was up and running by 1967.  It became available in time-sharing mode from university terminals in 1979, was transferred to CD-ROM in 1990, and version 1.0 was offered for sale to the public in 1992.  The current version is number 25 or 25+ (the "plus" version contains an important secondary reference called the [[Encyclopedia Talmudit]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biu.ac.il/jh/Responsa/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Responsa Project tries to base its electronic texts on the most accurate printed editions (though it seems that it is sometimes prevented from doing so because of copyright considerations), and it has a reputation for relatively error-free electronic texts based upon those editions.  It also features approximately 360,000 hypertext links between the various collections within the database, as well as a topical halakhic index for the [[Shulchan Aruch]] and selected responsa.  Since its early years it has employed a sophisticated search-engine specifically designed for Hebrew language texts.

In recent years (at least since version 10 in 2002), the Responsa Project has made updates available once a year, between the [[Passover]] and [[Shavuot]] holidays.

In January, 2007, the responsa project became available in an online edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.responsa.co.il/|title=Online Responsa Project - vast Jewish sources|website=www.responsa.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2007 the Responsa Project won the [[Israel Prize]] for Jewish studies.

===DBS Master Library===
DBS rivals the Bar-Ilan Responsa project in size.  It has less in the overall area of [[Halakha]] and fewer [[responsa]], but it includes far more in the following areas: Jewish philosophy, Kabbalah, Hasidut, biblical commentaries, and late halakhic works.

DBS contains a good number of Hebrew texts with vowels ([[niqqud]]); see [[Torah database#Digital Hebrew Texts with Vowels (Niqqud)|below]].  Criticisms: It does not have extensive [[hypertext]] links between its various large collections.

=== Soncino Classics Collection ===

Produced by [[Davka|Davka corporation]], Soncino Classics Collection&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davka.com/cgi-bin/product.cgi?product=35&lt;/ref&gt; includes
# [[Soncino Press|Soncino]] English translations of the Tanach, Babylonian Talmud, Midrash Rabbah, and Zohar;
# Hebrew and Aramaic texts of the Tanach, Babylonian Talmud, Midrash Rabbah and Zohar, as well as Rashi's commentary on Talmud.

Soncino Classics Collection is a commercial software.

===The Torah Bookshelf ("Halamish")===
''Otzar ha-Poskim'' (also see [[Torah database#Otzar ha-Shut|below]]) produces "The Torah Bookshelf," a large digital collection of basic texts called "Halamish" (Ha-Sifriyah ha-Toranit) in Hebrew, currently in version 3.0.

===Ariel===
Ariel (currently version 2.1) uses the same software as Otzar ha-Poskim's "Torah Bookshelf" and is similar to it in scope (a large basic collection), but many of the titles in the two collections are not the same.

===Mikra'ot Gedolot Haketer===
[[Bar-Ilan University]]'s project to produce an entirely new critical edition of the Mikra'ot Gedolot is also being made available not only in printed volumes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biu.ac.il/Press/mikraot.html&lt;/ref&gt; but also in electronic form. The project contains four main elements:
*The biblical text (based on the [[Aleppo codex]] and a careful reconstruction of its missing parts) is keyed-in, including vowels and [[cantillation]] signs, allowing for sophisticated research on details of grammar.
*The [[Masoretic Text|masorah]] is also keyed in (also based on the [[Aleppo codex]] and supplemented by a special commentary).
*The [[Targum]] is included with vowels, based on the Yemenite ''Taj''.
*The biblical commentaries are also keyed-in as fresh new critical editions, including textual variants from manuscripts.

The CD-ROM is currently in version 2.0 (beta).

''(Note: Although also under the auspices of Bar-Ilan University, this project is unrelated to the Bar-Ilan Responsa Project.)''

===Digital Hebrew Texts with Vowels (Niqqud)===

====Tanakh====
[[Tanakh]] is available as a keyed-in digital Hebrew text with vowels ([[niqqud]]) in ''all'' of the above software packages.

The Mikra'ot Gedolot Haketer package includes not only the vowels, but also [[cantillation]] signs.  Tanakh with both vowels and cantillation is also available as online freeware from Mechon Mamre (see [[Torah database#Mechon Mamre|below]]).  Both versions are based on the [[Aleppo codex]], but Mechon Mamre's edition is based on the editing method of Rabbi Mordecai Breuer, which differs slightly from the Mikra'ot Gedolot Haketer edition in some small details.

====Targum====
Both [[Targum Onkelos]] on the [[Torah]] and [[Targum Jonathan]] on [[Nevi'im]] are vowelized (based on Yemenite manuscripts) in the digital texts of Mikra'ot Gedolot Haketer.  [[Targum Onkelos]] is vowelized in the Judaic Bookshelf package.

====Mishnah====
The Mishnah is included as a keyed-in digital Hebrew text with vowels in all of the general software packages above. The vowels in the "Halamish" package seem to be based upon the Albeck edition of the Mishnah (see [[Mishnah#Oral traditions and pronunciation|Mishnah]]).

====Siddur and liturgy====
[[Siddur]]: Digital ''siddurim'' with vowels (according to various customs) are included in DBS (Ashkenaz, Sefard, Sefaradi/Edot Mizrah), Judaic Bookshelf (Ashkenaz, Sefard), and Ariel (Ashkenaz, Sefard, Sefaradi/Edot Mizrah).  The latest version of DBS (version 10) also includes ''mahzorim'', ''selihot'', and the Passover [[Haggadah]].

====Popular ethical works (musar)====
Popular ethical works are normally vowelized in published editions. DBS's collection of such works includes vowels in the electronic editions.

====Popular halakhic works====
Some of these are also vowelized in DBS.

==Page-Image Software Packages==

===Otzar HaHochma===
This project is based on page-images of over 80,000 scanned Jewish books . The search engine allows to search in over 65,000 of these volumes. It is possible to add additional libraries (Mosad Harav Kook, Machon Yerushalayim Publications, Ahavat Shalom Publishers, and Kehot Publication Society). Additionally, the user can find books by topic. The system has features which turns it to a learning tool.[https://www.otzar.org/]

===Otzar ha-Shut===
''Otzar ha-Poskim'' produces "Otzar ha-Shut" (hyperlinked images of individual responsa indexed according to the order of the [[Shulhan Arukh]]).  This package also includes "Halamish" (see [[Torah database#The Torah Bookshelf ("Halamish")|above]]).

===The Steinzaltz Talmud on CD-ROM===
The [[Adin Steinsaltz|Steinsaltz]] Talmud is available as searchable PDF images on CD-ROM.  All material from the printed edition is included, but it can be copied and pasted only as images and not as digital text.

==Wikimedia Torah study projects==
Text study projects at '''[[:s:Wikisource|Wikisource]]''' allow contributors to help build [[free content]] Torah databases at Wikimedia through volunteer typing and editing. Please note that in most instances, these projects proceed much faster in Hebrew than in English.
*'''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]''' (Rabbinic Bible) in '''[[:s:he:מקראות גדולות|Hebrew]]''' [[:s:he:מ"ג איכה א א|(sample)]] and '''[[:s:Mikraot Gedolot|English]]''' [[:s:MG Numbers 1:1|(sample)]].
*'''[[Cantillation]]''' at the '''"Vayavinu Bamikra" Project''' in '''[[:s:he:ויבינו במקרא|Hebrew]]''' (lists nearly 200 recordings) and '''[[:s:Vayavinu Bamikra|English]]'''.
*'''[[Mishnah]]''' in '''[[:s:he:משנה|Hebrew]]''' and '''[[:s:Mishnah|English]]''' [[:s:Mishnah/Seder Zeraim/Tractate Berakhot/Chapter 1/1|(sample)]].
*'''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''' in '''[[:s:he:שולחן ערוך|Hebrew]]''' and '''[[:s:Shulchan Aruch|English]]''' (Hebrew text with English translation).
*'''[[Aruch HaShulchan]]''' is available in a [[:s:he:AHS|newly formatted, digital Hebrew version at Hebrew Wikisource]] (over 600 chapters are currently available). See also [[:s:he:AHS:OH|Orach Chaim index]].

==Free Torah Libraries Online==

[[File:Tuccia Wellcome L0063762.jpg|thumb|'The Vestal' by [[Joshua Reynolds]], showing Tuccia.]]
'''Tuccia''' was an ancient Roman [[Vestal Virgin]] whose chastity was questioned by a spurious accusation.  When the piety of holy men and women was doubted by sceptics, the gods could perform miracles to vindicate them. In Tuccia's case she utilized a flat perforated basket to carry water, without the water falling to the ground through the sieve.

Tuccia's decision to prove her innocence is recounted:
:''O Vesta, if I have always brought pure hands to your secret services, make it so now that with this sieve I shall be able to draw water from the Tiber and bring it to Your temple'' (Vestal Virgin Tuccia in [[Valerius Maximus]] 8.1.5 absol).

Tuccia proved her innocence by carrying a [[sieve]] full of water from the [[Tiber]] to the Temple of Vesta [Augustine, De Civitate Dei, X, 16, in Worsfold, 69].

The Vestal Tuccia was celebrated in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''Natural History'' (28: 12) and [[Petrarch]]'s ''Triumph of Chastity'' in ''[[Triumphs]]''. However, in [[Juvenal]]'s ''[[Satire VI]]'' (famously renamed 'Against Women') he references her as one of many lascivious women.

==Sieve Iconography==
By the late Middle Ages, the image of Tuccia and her sieve became associated with the virtue of chastity. Paintings of chaste women would often include a sieve and this symbol figures prominently in many depictions of England's "Virgin Queen" [[Elizabeth I]] in the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;'''Elizabeth I Then and Now''', compiled &amp; edited by Georgianna Ziegler (Folger Shakespeare Library: 2003); essay "Portraying Queens: the International Language of Court Portraiture in the Sixteenth Century", by Sheila ffolliott, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wojciech Gerson - Zjawa Barbary Radziwiłłówny.jpg|thumb|''The Ghost of [[Barbara Radziwiłł]]'' by [[Wojciech Gerson]]: ghosts are a common form of the undead in [[folklore]].]]
The '''undead''' are beings in mythology, legend, or fiction that are deceased but behave as if they were alive. A common example of an undead being is a corpse reanimated by [[supernatural]] forces, by the application of either the deceased's own [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]] or that of another being (such as a [[demon]]).

The undead may be [[Incorporeality|incorporeal]] like [[ghost]]s, or [[Human body|corporeal]] like [[vampire]]s and [[zombie]]s. The undead are featured in the belief systems of most cultures, and appear in many works of [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] and [[horror fiction]]. The term is also occasionally used for putative non-supernatural cases of re-animation, from early experiments like [[Robert E. Cornish]]'s to future sciences such as chemical brain preservation and [[cryonics]].

[[Bram Stoker]] considered using the title, ''The Un-Dead'', for his novel ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897), and use of the term in the novel is mostly responsible for the modern sense of the word. The word does appear in English before Stoker but with the more literal sense of "alive" or "not dead", for which citations can be found in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. In one passage, ''[[nosferatu (word)|Nosferatu]]'' is given as an "Eastern European" synonym for "un-dead".&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book
  | last = Stoker
  | first = Bram
  | editor = Leonard Wolf

  | year = 1975
  | origyear =1897
  | isbn = 978-0-517-52017-8
  | page= 193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stoker's use of the term "undead" refers only to [[vampires]]; the extension to other types of supernatural beings arose later. Most commonly, it is now taken to refer to supernatural beings which had at one point been alive and continue to display some aspects of life after death, but the usage is highly variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216141734/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=BieCans.sgm&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=1&amp;division=div1 | archive-date=2003-02-16 | url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=BieCans.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=1&amp;division=div1 | title=Can Such Things Be | publisher=Etext.virginia.edu | date= | accessdate=2012-07-31 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:Les amants trépassés, The deceased lovers.jpg|thumb|upright|''The deceased lovers'', ca. 1470 ([[Strasbourg]], [[Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame]])]]

In [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]'', [[Van Helsing]] describes the Un-Dead as the following:
{{quote|‘Before we do any-thing, let me tell you this. It is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the UnDead. When they become such, there comes with the  change  the  curse  of  immortality.  They  cannot  die,  but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiply-ing the evils of the world. For all that die from the preying of  the  Undead  become  themselves  Undead,  and  prey  on their  kind.  And  so  the  circle  goes  on  ever  widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water... But of the most blessed of all, when this now UnDead be made to rest as [[True death|true dead]], then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.|[[Van Helsing]], [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]]'s Diary, 29 September; ''[[Dracula]]'', Chapter 16}}

Later notable 19th-century stories about the avenging undead included [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s ''[[The Death of Halpin Frayser]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=BieCans.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=1&amp;division=div1 |title=Can Such Things Be |publisher=Etext.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various [[Gothic Romanticism]] tales by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Though their works could not be properly considered zombie fiction, the supernatural tales of Bierce and Poe would prove influential on later writers such as [[H. P. Lovecraft]], by Lovecraft's own admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/superhor.htm |title=SUPERNATURAL HORROR IN LITERATURE (1927, 1933 - 1935) by H.P.

[[File:Utagawa Yoshiiku Specter.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Utagawa Yoshiiku]], ''Specter frightening a young woman'']]

In the [[Harry Potter]] series, [[Lord Voldemort]] uses reanimated dead bodies that are placed under his control by his [[dark arts (Harry Potter)|dark magic]] powers as his [[wikt:guardian|guardian]]s. They are known as [[Inferi (Harry Potter)|Inferi]].

The '''urdhva lokas''' or upper spheres of the world are composed of seven lokas or "world" according to Hindu mythology. The detailed explanation of them is found in [[Vishnu Purana]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==List of lokas==
*Bhūloka-The sphere of the earth or Bhū-loka, comprehending its oceans, mountains, and rivers, extends as far as it is illuminated by the rays of the sun and moon; and to the same extent, both in diameter and circumference, the sphere of the sky (Bhuva-loka) spreads above it (as far upwards as to the planetary sphere, or Swar-loka). Wherever earthy substance exists, which may be traversed by the feet, that constitutes the sphere of the earth (Bhu Loka).‘Bhu’ means ‘Earth’ and ‘loka’ means the surface of planet Earth, where we live.
*Bhuva Loka-The region that extends from the earth to the sun, in which the [[Siddhas]] and other celestial beings move, is the atmospheric sphere (Bhuva Loka). Bhuva-loka is identified with Earth’s atmosphere and sometimes with the space which is in the immediate neighborhood of Earth.
*Suva Loka- The interval between the sun and [[Dhruva]], extending fourteen hundred thousand leagues, is called by those who are acquainted with the system of the universe the heavenly sphere (Suva Loka).Suva-loka (alternatively Swar-loka) is beyond Bhuvaloka.Some description makes it a planet inhabited by the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s with their king [[Indra]].Some references make it equivalent to the [[Swarga]].Some Puranic references equate Suvaloka to the Solar System.
*Mahaloka-Above Dhruva, at the distance of ton million leagues, lies the sphere of saints, or Maha-loka, the inhabitants of which dwell in it throughout a Kalpa, or day of Brahmá.
*Janaloka-At twice that distance is situated Janaloka, where Sanandana and other pure-minded sons of [[Brahma|Brahmá]], reside.
*Tapoloka- At four times the distance, between the two last, lies the Tapo-loka (the sphere of penance), inhabited by the deities called Vaibhrájas, who are unconsumable by fire.
*Satyaloka-At six times the distance (or twelve Crores, a hundred and twenty millions of leagues) is situated Satya-loka, the sphere of truth, the inhabitants of which never again know death

These three lower spheres are termed transitory: the three highest, Jana, Tapa, and Satya, are styled durable 4: Maharloka, as situated between the two, has also a mixed character; for although it is deserted at the end of the Kalpa, it was not destroyed yet.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

'''Walter Aldro Day, Jr.''' (born May 14, 1949) is an American businessman, historian, and the founder of [[Twin Galaxies]], an [[United States|American]] organization that tracks [[video game]] [[world record]]s and conducts a program of electronic-gaming promotions. Day is an authority on video game scorekeeping records,&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;(May 17, 2009) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8512395 Iowa town seeks status as video gamers' mecca]''The Guardian'', retrieved March 19, 2012. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928194116/http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8512395 |date=2015-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Inquirer"&gt;McKenna, Aaron (July 27, 2005)[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1042020/bitter-games-rivalry-erupts--between-france-and-england Bitter games rivalry erupts between France and England] ''The Inquirer'', retrieved March 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; who in 2010 retired from the industry to pursue a career in music.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ax6yU0rNtvY|Walter Day Retires}} Twin Galaxies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Day was born in [[Oakland, California]], on May 14, 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walter Day - Biography|url=http://walterday.com/biography|accessdate=May 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724053133/http://walterday.com/biography|archive-date=2013-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His father worked for the [[Federal government of the United States]] as a purchaser of [[jet engines]]. Day enrolled at [[Salem State College]] in 1967 and left the school in 1978 without obtaining a degree. He later moved to the city of [[Boston]] and pursued the practice of [[Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref name="DesMoines Register"/&gt;

==Career==
Day has had several professions and hobbies during his life, including being an oil trader, landlord, vintage-newspaper vendor, musician and video arcade owner.&lt;ref name="DesMoines Register"&gt;Finney, Daniel P. (March 16, 2012) [http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20120316/NEWS/303160032/Iowan-scores-a-place-in-video-game-history?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|Frontpage Iowan Scores a Place in Video Game History], ''Des Moines Register'', retrieved March 18, 2012{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to the town of [[Fairfield, Iowa]], Day sold commemorative newspapers for a living and in 1980 went to [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], to become an [[oil future]]s trader.&lt;ref name="DesMoines Register3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walterday.com/about|title=Walter Day - About|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discouraged, Day moved back to Fairfield and became a landlord and purchased the Twin Galaxies arcade in [[Ottumwa, Iowa]], in 1981.&lt;ref name="DesMoines Register3" /&gt; After reading the January 18, 1982 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', which featured video games on its cover, Day was inspired to create an international scoreboard database. According to Day's company web site, within six months he was receiving 50 to 75 phone calls per day from video game players around the world wanting to report their high scores. Later, Day became "known as the king of video game stats" and his scoreboard was published in Joystik and Video Games magazine every month.&lt;ref name="Guardian3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawkeye3"&gt;Smith, William (March 16, 2012) [http://www.thehawkeye.com/story/video-games-031612 Area gaming icon to be honored at Smithsonian], ''The Hawkeye'', retrieved April 2, 2012. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405055033/http://www.thehawkeye.com/story/video-games-031612 |date=2012-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Involvement with Guinness World Records ===
Beginning in the summer of 1983, Walter Day became the official supplier of verified video game scores to Guinness World Records. It was the first time that Guinness World Records had ever recognized video games as a valid category, citing the problems faced with the different versions of the games, as well as a myriad of bugs, and the inability to verify video game claims through the mail. Walter Day's organization Twin Galaxies was able to provide Guinness World Records with verified scores that were adjudicated in person during a series of annual contests held each summer during 1983-1985. David Boehm, then-publisher of Guinness World Records, named Day the Guinness ‘Assistant-Editor’ in charge of video game scores and records. The verified world records appeared in the 1984 to 1986 editions of the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]. Day closed his Ottumwa arcade in 1984 but continued his international score keeping activities through his company Twin Galaxies.Day represented Guinness World Records on July 2, 1985, in Victoria BC, Canada, when Mark Sutton was proclaimed the new world record pole-sitter after a successful 488-day stint perched atop a pole.

Day also verified competitive foosball records and conducted in 1985 the Twin Galaxies Iron Man Contest which saw 10 competitors attempt to keep a single game going for 100 hours on one quarter in hopes of winning $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Walter Day|title=Walter Day Interviewed on CHEK-TV, Victoria, BC, Canada July 8, 1985.|date=2017-03-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ1hfr2_BsU|accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004, Day joined forces with Guinness World Records science &amp; technology editor David Hawksett at Sweden's Dreamhack 2004 LAN event to verify a new world record on the largest number of separate computers connected in a single LAN network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liquipedia.net/rainbowsix/DreamHack|title=DreamHack|work=Liquipedia Rainbow Six Wiki|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Day's long-time work as a video game adjudicator and [[eSports]] pioneer inspired the creation of the [[Guinness World Records Gamer’s Edition|Guinness World Records - Gamer's Edition]].

On August 11, 2017, in Helsinki, Finland, Day took the stage during the science fiction Hugo Awards ceremonies to present a Guinness World Records citation that recognized the Hugo Awards as history's longest-running science fiction award. This same presentation was repeated the following year as Day presented this same award again on August 16, 2018, during the 2018 Hugo Awards festivities in San Jose, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ottumwacourier.com/news/iowa-man-does-the-honors-at-hugo-awards/article_d5eb76d8-8d0f-11e7-9f70-cb393ce961f7.html|title=Iowa man does the honors at Hugo Awards|last=Newman|first=Mark|work=Ottumwa Courier|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vendingtimes.com/articles/twin-galaxies-walter-day-does-honors-for-guinness-10978|title=Twin Galaxies' Walter Day Does Honors For Guinness At Hugo Awards Bash {{!}} Articles {{!}} Vending Times|website=www.vendingtimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, 2017, Day presented a Guinness World Records citation to the [[The Pinball Expo|Pinball Expo]] in Chicago, Illinois, recognizing the Pinball Expo, which was founded in 1985, as history's longest-running pinball event.&lt;ref name="Hawkeye3"/&gt;

=== Film and TV Career ===
Appearing in approximately 20 documentary films as himself, Day’s role as the first [[eSports]] pioneer has been thoroughly examined on the big screen. His historical projects using vintage newspapers, high school yearbooks, antique business cards and commemorative trading cards have also appeared on the silver screen as well as in more than 100 TV news broadcasts. A partial list of his appearances in documentary films includes: [[Icons (TV series)|Icons]] (2002), [[Coin-Op TV]] (2007), [[Chasing Ghosts: Beyond the Arcade]] (2007), [[The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters]] (2007), [[Frag (film)|Frag]] (2008), [[The Video Craze]] (2013), [[Gamer Age]] (2014), [[The King of Arcades]] (2015), [[Nintendo Quest]] (2015) and [[Man vs Snake]] (2015). He has also appeared on national TV shows like [[The Bob Braun Show]] (1982), ABC-TV’s [[That’s Incredible]] (1983), [[Entertainment Tonight]] (1985), [[PM Magazine]] (1987), [[CBS This Morning]] (1988), and [[Gary Collins’ Hour Magazine]] (1989).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2436615/?ref_=nv_sr_1&lt;/ref&gt; Documentary footage of Walter Day’s early video game career filmed by Lewis Wilson and John Sorflaten in 1982 and 1983 is considered the earliest known attempt to film a documentary on the burgeoning video game culture. That vintage footage was the original source material used widely throughout both [[Chasing Ghosts: Beyond the Arcade]] and [[The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxSIC2r92_Jmw0N7cIQonpA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://thewalterdaycollection.com/collection/gallery/item/0168-sorflaten-wilson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SxgdpudDW0&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amateur Ragtime Piano Career ===
Between 1973 and the early 1980s, Day enjoyed a brief career as an amateur ragtime pianist, publicly performing in Massachusetts (Beverly and Salem), New York State (Livingstone Manor and South Fallsburg), France (Avoriaz and Le Plagne), Switzerland (Brunnen, Leysin, St. Moritz and Arosa) and Fairfield, Iowa. He was self-taught and mastered the form by memorizing the songs, a feat that often took 8 hours of practice per day. His three most prominent performances were at Salem State College Music Festival, Salem, MA, October 22, 1975, the inaugural Spring Celebration, held on the MIU Campus (now [[Maharishi University of Management|MUM]]) in the new Maharishi Patanjali Golden Dome of Pure Knowledge, March, 1980, and the ‘Legendary Walter Day Plays Ragtime’ concert at the Barhydt Chapel, MUM Campus, Fairfield, Iowa, April 13, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;https://thewalterdaycollection.com/component/zoo/item/1980-ragtime-poster&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewalterdaycollection.com/component/zoo/item/04-10-1980-fairfield-ledger#|title=The Walter Day Collection - April 10, 1980 Fairfield Ledger, Fairfield, Iowa|work=The Walter Day Collection|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://thewalterdaycollection.com/component/zoo/item/04-09-1980-ottumwa-courier ''Ottumwa Courier'' April 9, 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Projects ===
[[File:Skyskipperreveal.jpg|thumb|right|Day at the reveal of a restored ''[[Sky Skipper]]'' cabinet in 2017. [[Billy Mitchell (video game player)|Billy Mitchell]] is at the far right.]]
In 1997, Day authored a 984-page volume of video game record scores and created a team of volunteers to verify scores nationwide. Day and his staff created the first book of rules for competitive electronic gaming, and his company Twin Galaxies produced an annual 1,000-page book of records and rules.&lt;ref name="Guardian2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DesMoines Register2" /&gt; A second edition, of 1000 pages was published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/ About TwinGalaxies - Our Unique History]&lt;/ref&gt; The publication has become the "official record book for the worldwide electronic gaming industry".&lt;ref name="Guardian2" /&gt; Day appeared at "hundreds" of video game gatherings and competitions wearing a black-and-white-striped referee shirt and became an "iconic" figure in video game record keeping.&lt;ref name="DesMoines Register2" /&gt;

In August, 2005, Day led a contingent of video game players to France to issue a formal video game challenge involving video game players in both London and Paris.&lt;ref name="Inquirer2" /&gt; Day was featured in a three-part documentary filmed by [[VBS.tv]] and published on the Internet in 2009, under the title ''Walter Day: Twin Galaxies and the Two Golden Domes''.&lt;ref name="DesMoines Register2" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; Day's contributions to the video game industry were portrayed in the 2007 documentaries ''[[The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters]]'' and ''[[Chasing Ghosts: Beyond the Arcade]]''.&lt;ref name="DesMoines Register2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawkeye2" /&gt;

Day retired from the video game industry in May 2010 to pursue a career in music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walter Day retires from Twin Galaxies, gaming hall of fame to be opened (March, 6th 2010)|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/03/06/walter-day-retires-from-twin-galaxies-gaming-hall-of-fame-to-be/|publisher=By Ben Gilbert of [[Joystiq]]|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Day has helped to establish the [[International Video Game Hall of Fame]] in Ottumwa and attended the video game art exhibition at the [[Smithsonian]] art museum.&lt;ref name="DesMoines Register"/&gt;

== Trivia ==
Day is widely recognized as the inspiration for Mr. Litwak, the beloved arcade owner in Disney's ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' animated film released in November 2012.

''[[Ready Player One]]'' author [[Ernest Cline]] says Walter Day (along with Twin Galaxies and [[Billy Mitchell (video game player)|Billy Mitchell]]) were the inspiration for writing his story in 2011, which was later turned into a [[Steven Spielberg]] science fiction [[Ready Player One (film)|film]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw_i9a0w0mg&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Western astrology''' is the system of [[astrology]] most popular in Western countries. Western astrology is historically based on [[Ptolemy]]'s  ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' (2nd century CE), which in turn was a continuation of [[Hellenistic astrology|Hellenistic]] and ultimately [[Babylonian astrology|Babylonian]] traditions.

Western astrology is largely [[horoscopic astrology|horoscopic]], that is, it is a form of [[divination]] based on the construction of a [[horoscope]] for an exact moment, such as a person's birth, in which various cosmic bodies are said to have an influence.
Astrology in western [[popular culture]] is often reduced to [[sun sign astrology]], which considers only the individual's date of birth (i.e. the "position of the Sun" at that date).

Astrology is generally regarded as [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. It has consistently failed objective tests.&lt;ref name= SvenOve/&gt;&lt;ref name= ASotP/&gt;

==Core principles==

[[File:Vitruvian macrocosm.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Robert Fludd]]'s 16th-century illustration of man the microcosm within the universal macrocosm]]
A central principle of astrology is integration within the cosmos. The individual, Earth, and its environment are viewed as a single organism, all parts of which are correlated with each other.{{efn|"the entire universe is alive in mutual concord of its elements and is driven by the pulse of reason, since a single spirit dwells in all its parts and, speeding through all things, nourishes it like a living creature".&lt;ref&gt;Manilius (77) p.87-89 (II.64-67)&lt;/ref&gt;}} Cycles of change that are observed in the heavens are therefore reflective (not causative) of similar cycles of change observed on earth and within the individual.{{Efn|[[Al-Kindi]] (9th century) is clarifying this point where he says in his text ''On the Stellar Rays'', ch.4:  "... we say that one thing acts with its elemental rays on another, but according to the exquisite truth it does not act but only the celestial harmony acts".}} This relationship is expressed in the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] maxim "as above, so below; as below, so above", which postulates symmetry between the individual as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] and the celestial environment as a macrocosm.{{efn|"The doctrine of the Pythagoreans was a combination of science and mysticism… Like Anaximenes they viewed the Universe as one integrated, living organism, surrounded by Divine Air (or more literally 'Breath'), which permeates and animates the whole cosmos and filters through to individual creatures… By partaking of the core essence of the Universe, the individual is said to act as a microcosm in which all the laws in the macrocosm of the Universe are at work".&lt;ref name="Houlding_28"&gt;{{harvp|Houlding|2000|p=28}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the heart of astrology is the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] principle that mathematical relationships express qualities or 'tones' of energy which manifest in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds – all connected within a pattern of proportion. [[Pythagoras]]  first identified that the pitch of a musical note is in proportion to the length of the string that produces it, and that intervals between harmonious sound frequencies form simple numerical ratios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Weiss|Taruskin|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a theory known as the [[Harmony of the Spheres]], Pythagoras proposed that the Sun, Moon and planets all emit their own unique hum based on their orbital revolution,{{efn|"…occasionally Pythagoras draws on the theory of music, and designates the distance between the Earth and the Moon as a whole tone, that between the Moon and Mercury as a semitone, .... the seven tones thus producing the so-called diapason,'' i.e''. a universal harmony".&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder (77) pp.277-8, (II.xviii.xx)&lt;/ref&gt;}} and that the quality of life on Earth reflects the tenor of celestial sounds which are physically imperceptible to the human ear.&lt;ref name="Houlding_28"/&gt; Subsequently, Plato described astronomy and music as "twinned" studies of sensual recognition: astronomy for the eyes, music for the ears, and both requiring knowledge of numerical proportions.{{efn|"As the eyes, said I, seem formed for studying astronomy, so do the ears seem formed for harmonious motions: and these seem to be twin sciences to one another, as also the Pythagoreans say".&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1901) p.252.{{full citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato's ''Republic'' VII.XII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later philosophers retained the close association between astronomy, optics, music and astrology, including Ptolemy, who wrote influential texts on all these topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smith|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mhLVHR5QAQkC&amp;pg=PA2 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Kindi]], in the 9th century, developed Ptolemy's ideas in ''De Aspectibus'' which explores many points of relevance to astrology and the use of planetary aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindberg|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gy3Vp7TurVUC&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;dq=Alkindi%20de%20aspectibus%20astrology&amp;pg=PA245#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 245]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smith|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mhLVHR5QAQkC&amp;pg=PA56 56]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zodiac is the belt or band of constellations through which the Sun, Moon, and planets move on their journey across the sky. Astrologers noted these constellations and so attached a particular significance to them. Over time they developed the system of twelve [[Astrological sign|signs]] of the zodiac, based on twelve of the constellations through which the sun passes throughout the year, those constellations that are "Enlightened by the mind". Most western astrologers use the [[tropical zodiac]] beginning with the sign of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] at the [[Northern hemisphere]] [[Vernal Equinox]] always on or around March 21 of each year.  The Western Zodiac is drawn based on the Earth's relationship to fixed, designated positions in the sky, and the Earth's seasons.  The Sidereal Zodiac is drawn based on the Earth's position in relation to the constellations, and follows their movements in the sky.

Due to a phenomenon called [[precession of the equinoxes]] (where the Earth's axis slowly rotates like a spinning top in a 25,700-year cycle), there is a slow shift in the correspondence between Earth's seasons (and calendar) and the constellations of the zodiac. Thus, the tropical zodiac corresponds with the position of the earth in relation to fixed positions in the sky (Western Astrology), while the sidereal zodiac is drawn based on the position in relation to the constellations (sidereal zodiac).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wood|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Western astrology the signs of the [[zodiac]] are believed to represent twelve basic personality types or characteristic modes of expression. The twelve signs are divided into four elements [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Air (classical element)|air]] and [[Water (classical element)|water]]. Fire and air signs are considered masculine, while water and earth signs are considered feminine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvp|Lofthus|1983|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve signs are also divided into three qualities, [[Cardinal sign (astrology)|Cardinal]], [[Fixed sign|fixed]] and [[Mutable sign|mutable]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{harvp|Pelletier|Cataldo|1984|pp=24–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{harvp|Pottenger|1991|pp=31–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Note: these are only approximations and the exact date on which the sign of the sun changes varies from year to year.
Zodiac sign for an individual depends on the placement of planets and the ascendant in that sign. If a person has nothing placed in a particular sign, that sign will play no active role in their personality. On the other hand, a person with, for example, both the sun and moon in Cancer, will strongly display the characteristics of that sign in their make up.

Newspapers often print astrology columns which purport to provide guidance on what might occur in a day in relation to the [[Astrological sign|sign]] of the zodiac that included the sun when the person was born. Astrologers refer to this as the "sun sign", but it is often commonly called the "star sign". These predictions are vague or general; so much so that even practising astrologers consider them of little to no value. Experiments have shown that when people are shown a newspaper horoscope for their own sign along with a newspaper horoscope for a different sign, they judge them to be equally accurate on the average.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paranormal-encyclopedia.com/f/forer-effect/ The Forer Effect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other tests have been performed on complete, personalized horoscopes cast by professional astrologers, and have shown similarly disappointing results,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skepsis.nl/astrot.html The AstroTest], An account of a test of the predictive power of astrology, with references to other experiments.&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the claims of professional astrologers.

In modern Western astrology the planets represent basic drives or impulses in the human psyche. These planets differ from the definition of a planet in [[astronomy]] in that the sun, moon, and recently, [[Pluto]] and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] (considered as [[dwarf planet]]s in [[astronomy]]), are all considered to be planets for the purposes of astrology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrologyclub.org/guide/planets/ |title=The Planets And Points |publisher=Astrologyclub.org |accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each planet is also said to be the [[Domicile (astrology)|ruler]] of one or two zodiac signs. The three modern planets have each been assigned rulership of a zodiac sign by astrologers and Ceres has been suggested as the ruler of Taurus or Virgo.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fenton|1991|pp=106–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pottenger|1991|pp=11–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally rulership of the signs was, according to [[Ptolemy]], based on seasonal derivations and astronomical measurement, whereby the luminaries being the brightest planets were given rulership of the brightest months of the year and Saturn the coldest furthest classical planet was given to the coldest months of the year, with the other planets ruling the remaining signs as per astronomical measurement. It is noteworthy that the modern rulerships do not follow the same logic.

The [[Planets in astrology|astrological 'planets']] are the seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients. The sun and moon, also known as 'the lights', are included as they were thought to act like the astronomical planets. Astrologers call Mercury, Venus and Mars the 'personal planets', as they represent the most immediate drives. The 'lights' symbolise respectively the existential and sensitive fundamentals of the individuality.

The following table summarizes the rulership by the seven classically known planets&lt;ref name=BitStreamPlanets&gt;[http://www2.bitstream.net/~bunlion/bpi/Planet.html Planet description]&lt;/ref&gt; of each of the twelve astrological signs,&lt;ref name=BitStreamSigns&gt;[http://www2.bitstream.net/~bunlion/bpi/Sign.html Signs description]&lt;/ref&gt; together with their effects on world events, people and the earth itself as understood in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1994|pp=105–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important in astrology are the [[Lunar node#Astrological significance|moon's nodes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parker|Parker|1990|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orbital node|nodes]] are where the [[moon (astrology)|moon]]'s path crosses the [[ecliptic]]. The North, or [[Orbital node|Ascending Node]] marks the place where the moon crosses from South to North (or ascends), while the South, or [[Orbital node|Descending Node]] marks where the moon crosses from North to South (or descends). While [[Lunar node#Astrological significance|Lunar nodes]] are not considered by Western astrologers to be as important a factor as each of the planets, they are thought to mark sensitive areas that are worth taking into account.

*[[File:Northnode-symbol.svg|20px]] - North or ascending [[Lunar node|Node]]. Also the ruler of Pathways and Choices.
*[[File:Southnode-symbol.svg|20px]] - South or descending Node. Also the ruler of Karma and the Past.

===Essential dignity===

In astrology, "essential dignity" is the strength of a planet or point's zodiac position, judged only by its position by sign and degree, what the pre-eminent 17th-century astrologer [[William Lilly]] called "the strength, fortitude or debility of the Planets [or] significators."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lilly|2005|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, essential dignity seeks to view the strengths of a planet or point as though it were isolated from other factors in the sky of the [[natal chart]]. Traditionally, there are five dignities: domicile and detriment, exaltation and fall, triplicity, terms, and face. However, the later two have diminished in usage. A planet's [[Domicile (astrology)|domicile]] is the zodiac sign over which it has rulership.

{{Main|Horoscope}}
Western astrology is based mainly upon the construction of a [[horoscope]], which is a map or ''chart'' of the heavens at a particular moment. The moment chosen is the beginning of the existence of the subject of the horoscope, as it is believed that the subject will carry with it the pattern of the heavens from that moment throughout its life. The most common form of horoscope is the [[natal chart]] based on the moment of a person's birth; though in theory a horoscope can be drawn up for the beginning of anything, from a business enterprise to the foundation of a nation state.
[[File:Thema Mundi.svg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Thema Mundi]]]]

===Interpretation===
In Western horoscopic astrology the interpretation of a horoscope is governed by:
*The position of the planets in the [[astrological sign]]s of the [[zodiac]],
*The position of the planets in the [[house (astrology)|houses]] of the horoscope,
*The position of the primary angles of the horoscope, namely the [[horizon]] line (called the [[ascendant]]/[[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]] axis), and the [[prime vertical]] line (called the [[zenith]]/[[midheaven]] and [[nadir]]/[[Imum Coeli|imum coeli]] axis),
*The angles formed by the planets relative to each other and the primary angles, called [[Astrological aspect|aspect]]s
*The position of deduced astronomical entities, such as the [[Lunar node]]s.

Some astrologers also use the position of various mathematical points such as the [[Arabic parts]].

===The primary angles===
&lt;!--
     HIDDEN EDITOR NOTE:
     DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE
     UNSOURCED ADDITIONS WILL BE REMOVED
--&gt;
There are [[Angle (astrology)|four primary angles]] in the horoscope (though the cusps of the [[House (astrology)|houses]] are often included as important angles by some astrologers).

*[[File:Ascendant-symbol.svg|20px]] - The [[ascendant]] or ''rising sign'' is the eastern point where the [[ecliptic]] and horizon intersect.  During the course of a day, because of the Earth's rotation, the entire circle of the ecliptic will pass through the ascendant and will be advanced by about 1°. This provides us with the term ''rising sign''', which is the sign of the zodiac that was rising in the east at the exact time that the horoscope or [[natal chart]] is calculated. In creating a horoscope the ascendant is traditionally placed as the left-hand side point of the chart. In most house systems the ascendant lies on the cusp of the 1st house of the horoscope.

The ascendant is generally considered the most important and personalized angle in the horoscope by the vast majority of astrologers. It signifies a person's awakening consciousness, in the same way that the Sun's appearance on the eastern horizon signifies the dawn of a new day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mayo|1991|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that the ascendant is specific to a particular time and place, it signifies the individual environment and conditioning that a person receives during their upbringing, and also the circumstances of their childhood. For this reason, the ascendant is also concerned with how a person has learned to present him or herself to the world, especially in public and in impersonal situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fenton|1989|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite point to the ascendant in the west is the [[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]], which denotes how a person reacts in their relationships with others. It also show the kind of person we are likely to be attracted to, and our ability to form romantic attachments. In most house systems the descendant lies on the cusp of the 7th house of the horoscope.

*[[File:Midheaven-symbol.svg|20px]]- The [[midheaven]] or ''medium coeli'' is the point on the ecliptic that is furthest above the plane of the horizon. For events occurring where the planes of the ecliptic and the horizon coincide, the limiting position for these points is located 90° from the ascendant. For astrologers, the midheaven traditionally indicates a person's career, status, aim in life, aspirations, public reputation, and life goal. In ''quadrant house'' systems the midheaven lies on the cusp of the 10th house of the horoscope.

The opposite point to the midheaven is known as the [[Imum Coeli|imum coeli]]. For astrologers the nadir or IC traditionally indicates the circumstances at the beginning and end of a person's life, their parents and the parental home, and their own domestic life. In ''quadrant house'' systems it lies on the cusp of the 4th house of the horoscope.

===The houses===

--&gt;
The horoscope is divided by astrologers into 12 portions called the houses. The houses of the horoscope are interpreted as being 12 different spheres of life or activity. There are various ways of calculating the houses in the horoscope or birth chart. However, there is no dispute about their meanings, and the 12 houses&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fenton|1991|pp=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern astrologers assume that the houses relate to their corresponding signs, i.e. that the first house has a natural affinity with the first sign, Aries, and so on.

===Aspects===
{{Main|Astrological aspects}}
&lt;!--
     HIDDEN EDITOR NOTE:
     DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE
     UNSOURCED ADDITIONS WILL BE REMOVED
--&gt;
The aspects are the angles the planets make to each other in the horoscope, and also to the ascendant, midheaven, descendant and nadir. The aspects are measured by the angular distance along the [[ecliptic]] in degrees and minutes of celestial longitude between two points, as viewed from the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mayo|1991|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; They indicate focal points in the horoscope where the energies involved are given extra emphasis. The more exact the angle, the more powerful the aspect, although an allowance of a few degrees each side of the aspect called an ''orb'' is allowed for interpretation. The following are the aspects in order of importance&lt;ref name="Pelletier_57_60"&gt;{{harvp|Pelletier|Cataldo|1984|pp=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton_137_139"&gt;{{harvp|Fenton|1991|pp=137–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[File:Conjunction-symbol.svg|20px]] - [[Astrological aspect#Conjunction|Conjunction]] 0° (orb ±8°). The conjunction is a major point in the chart, giving strong emphasis to the planets involved. The planets will act together to outside stimulus and act on each other.&lt;ref name="Pelletier_57_60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton_137_139"/&gt;
*[[File:Opposition-symbol.svg|20px]] - [[Astrological aspect#Opposition|Opposition]] 180° (orb ±8°).  The opposition is indicative of tension, conflict and confrontation, due to the polarity between the two elements involved. Stress arises when one is used over the other, causing an imbalance; but the opposition can work well if the two parts of the aspect are made to complement each other in a synthesis.&lt;ref name="Pelletier_57_60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton_137_139"/&gt;
*[[File:Trine-symbol.svg|20px]] - [[Trine (astrological aspect)|Trine]] 120°(orb ±8°). The trine indicates harmony, and ease of expression, with the two elements reinforcing each other. The trine is a source of artistic and creative talent, but can be a 'line of least resistance' to a person of weak character.&lt;ref name="Pelletier_57_60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton_137_139"/&gt;
*[[File:Square-symbol.svg|20px]] - [[Astrological aspect#Square|Square]] 90°(orb ±8°). The square indicates frustration, inhibitions, disruption and inner conflict, but can become a source of energy and activation to a person determined to overcome limitations.&lt;ref name="Pelletier_57_60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton_137_139"/&gt;
*[[File:Sextile-symbol.svg|20px]] - [[Astrological aspect#Sextile (abrv. SXT)|Sextile]] 60°(orb ±6°). The sextile is similar to the trine, but of less significance. It indicates ease of communication between the two elements involved, with compatibility and harmony between them.&lt;ref name="Pelletier_57_60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton_137_139"/&gt;
*[[File:Quincunx-symbol.svg|20px]] - [[Astrological aspect#Quincunx (abrv. INC.)|Quincunx]] 150°(orb ±3°). The quincunx indicates difficulty and stress, due to incompatible elements being forced together. It can mean an area of self-neglect in a person's life (especially health), or obligations being forced on a person. The quincunx can vary from minor to quite major in impact.&lt;ref name="Pelletier_57_60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton_137_139"/&gt;
*[[File:Semisextile-symbol.svg|20px]] - [[Astrological aspect#Semisextile (abrv. SSX)|Semisextile]] 30° (orb ±2°). Slight in effect. Indicates an area of life where a conscious effort to be positive will have to be made.&lt;ref name="Pelletier_57_60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton_137_139"/&gt;
*[[File:Semisquare-symbol.svg|20px]] - [[Astrological aspect#Semisquare (abrv. SSQ)|Semisquare]] 45°(orb ±2°).  Indicates somewhat difficult circumstance. Similar in effect to semisextile.&lt;ref name="Pelletier_57_60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton_137_139"/&gt;

===Sidereal and tropical astrology===

--&gt;
There are two camps of thought among western astrologers about the "starting point", 0 degrees Aries, in the zodiac. [[Sidereal astrology]] uses a fixed starting point in the background of stars, while [[tropical astrology]], used by the majority of Western astrologers, chooses as a starting point the position of the Sun against the background of stars at the Northern hemisphere vernal equinox (i.e. when the Sun position against the heavens crosses over from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere) each year.

As the Earth spins on its axis, it "wobbles" like a top, causing the vernal equinox to move gradually backwards against the star background, (a phenomenon known as the [[Precession of the equinoxes]]) at a rate of about 30 degrees (one Zodiacal sign length) every 2,160 years. Thus the two zodiacs would be aligned only once every 26,000 years. They were aligned about 2,000 years ago when the zodiac was originally established.

This phenomenon gives us the conceptual basis for the [[Age of Aquarius]], whose "dawning" coincides with the movement of the vernal equinox across the cusp from Pisces to Aquarius in the star background.

==Astrology and science==

The majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator's future.&lt;ref name=Cosmic&gt;{{harvp|Bennett|Donohue|Schneider|Voit|2007|pp=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so "in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary".&lt;ref name=Humanist&gt;{{cite web|title=Objections to Astrology: A Statement by 186 Leading Scientists |publisher=The Humanist, September/October 1975 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/astrology.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318140638/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/astrology.html|archivedate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehumanist.org/the-humanist-archive/ The Humanist], volume 36, no.5 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bok|Jerome|Kurtz|1982|pp=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Woodenfish Foundation''', previously known as "Woodenfish Project," is an international Buddhist educational [[NGO]]&lt;ref name="About-us"&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.woodenfish.org/about-us|website=The Woodenfish Foundation|publisher=The Woodenfish Foundation|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with operations in the [[United States]] and [[China]]. [[Yifa]] founded the "Woodenfish Project" in 2002 at [[Fo Guang Shan]] in [[Kaohsiung]], Taiwan. The initial flagship program, "Humanistic Buddhist Monastic Life Program" aims to allow students from around the world to authentically experience Humanistic Buddhism for one month each summer within a monastic context.

In the past 13 years, Woodenfish program alumni and Yifa have driven the organizational growth to expand into programming in the United States and mainland China. Woodenfish Foundation became a registered [[501(c)(3) organization]] in [[California]] in 2007. Between 2009 and 2015, Woodenfish has run 13 programs in mainland China. In 2015, Woodenfish opened [[New York City]] headquarters and hired its first full-time staff.

The Woodenfish Foundation was granted special consultative status with the [[United Nations]] through [[ECOSOC]] in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woodenfish Gains Special Consultative Status with United Nations' ECOSOC|url=http://www.woodenfish.org/single-post/2016/08/02/Woodenfish-Gains-Special-Consultative-Status-with-United-Nations-ECOSOC|website=Woodenfish website blog|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its second decade, Woodenfish continues to build its base within China and the United States, aiming to fulfill its mission to the greatest extent and offer opportunities for scholastic inquiry and collaboration, and contemplative and cross-cultural peace training.

The namesake comes from the [[wooden fish]] instrument, the most common religious musical instrument used in [[East Asian Buddhism]].

==Mission &amp; Programs==

Woodenfish Foundation aims to establish a global network of ethical and compassionate professionals, scholars, and leaders. Woodenfish cultivates ongoing exploration of one's inner life, and inspires meaningful engagement with the pressing global issues of modern times. As of one of the few Buddhist organizations with operations in New York and P.R. China, Woodenfish is uniquely positioned to further meaningful dialogue and mutual understanding within what may be considered the most significant bilateral relationship of the 21st century. Woodenfish Foundation envisions a world in which the actions of individuals and communities around the world cultivate peace, compassion, preservation of human dignity and sustainable living.

Woodenfish Foundation programs include Humanistic Buddhist Monastic Life Program (HBMLP), Buddhism in China Series, Sutra Translation Councils, Cultural peace training program, lay dharma teacher training program, and camps for Chinese youth.

The primary objective of the HBMLP program is to promote the understanding of [[Chinese Buddhism]] by exposing the participants to the daily practice of [[Humanistic Buddhism]] within a traditional Buddhist monastery. HBMLP provides students interested in the study of religion, [[Buddhism]] and/or Chinese culture and language first-hand experience in the lifestyle, training, and functions of contemporary Chinese Buddhist monastics. Classes taught on various levels by the knowledgeable monastics and staff, inform students on Buddhist history, doctrine and philosophy, as well as classes offered regarding the liturgical instruments, monastic etiquette, [[meditation]] practice and other functions and rituals. All instruction is given in English or is translated from Mandarin. Other key elements of the program include:
* Offering participants a chance to view and experience Buddhism as it is practiced in modern-day [[China]].
* Introducing participants to the concepts and practices of [[Humanistic Buddhism]].
* Communal activities within the monastery, such as vegetable gardening, kitchen duty, etc.
* Daily participation in many of the routine activities within a Buddhist monastery.
* A five- to seven-day silent [[meditation]] retreat.
* Cultivating spirituality through [[meditation]].
* A cultural tour.

Through the “Buddhism in China Series”, Woodenfish aims to aid the development of emerging scholars in the West with research interests in Chinese Buddhism or related fields by offering the opportunity for direct, intensive academic engagement with major historical centers of Buddhism in China. Each year, from 2009 to 2012 the program took groups of scholars to study religious sites in different regions of China. Through personal tours, participants gain on-the-ground knowledge of the history and diversity of Buddhism in China, its relationship to other cultural institutions, and its ongoing vitality. Special attention was given to introducing participants to potential sources and avenues for research, and promoting interaction with Chinese scholars and religious professionals. The program was also geared towards fostering international exchange and building networks among scholars of Chinese religion, history, and culture.

Starting from 2012, Woodenfish launched the “Buddhism in China—Connecting with the Source Program.” This is a semi-annual program that offers faculty, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates opportunities for direct and intensive engagement with important historical centers of Chinese Buddhism and culture. Previous programs have included a Platform Sutra Seminar in [[Nanhua Temple]] led by Peter Gregory ([[Smith College]]), a Guanyin Seminar on [[Mount Putuo|Mt. Putuo]] by Chün-fang Yü ([[Columbia University]]) and Bhikkhuni Vinaya Seminar by Ann Heirman (Ghent University) at Sichuan Nuns College. In the summer of 2014, renowned scholar Professor Daniel B. Stevenson was invited on Tiantai Study to lead a seminar at [[Tiantai Mountain|Mt. Tiantai]].

==Program Alumni==
With 14 years of programming since 2002, the Woodenfish network is global, and includes over 1,000 members pursuing a variety of professions. Participants hail from some of the best universities across the globe, with many alumni from [[Princeton University]], [[Stanford University]], [[Yale University]], and [[Harvard University]]. Participants are diverse in backgrounds but there is a concentration of Asian Studies, Buddhist Studies, and Comparative Religion majors.  The participants may be in their undergraduate years, may be working on their Ph.D., or working as young professionals across a variety of industries. The most popular career fields for Woodenfish alumni include academia/higher education, law, medicine, and international development/non-profit management.
