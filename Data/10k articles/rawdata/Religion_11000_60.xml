'''A Rocha''' is an international network of [[environmental organization]]s with a Christian ethos. A Rocha, which means "the rock" in Portuguese (see entry ''[[Rocha (surname)|Rocha]]''), was founded in Portugal in 1983&lt;ref name="elsdon"/&gt;

==Organization==

The organization network is constituted by A Rocha International (ARI), as a supporting body, and other organizations, which can be National Organizations or Associated Projects. Each organization is independent.&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt;

As of 2016, A Rocha is working in several countries: [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Ghana]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Lebanon]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]]/[[Aotearoa]], [[Nigeria]], [[Peru]], [[Portugal]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]], [[Uganda]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]].&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt; There are ongoing conversations with other potential groups around the world, particularly in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="intl-review-2017"/&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

A Rocha’s ''[[modus operandi]]'' is based on five guiding principles: Christian, Conservation, Community, Cooperation, and Cross-Cultural.&lt;ref name="meet"/&gt;

==Work==
A Rocha aims to protect the environment through local, community-based conservation, scientific research, and environmental education,&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt; and they have “a track record of successes”.&lt;ref name="cb-22-4"/&gt;

[[Image:Ringing 05 Determining characteristics.jpg|thumb|A [[bird ringing|bird ringer]] aging a [[Hoopoe]] at the Cruzinha field studies centre, Portugal]]
A Rocha operates [[field study]] centres in Canada (two centres), France (two centres), India, Kenya, Portugal&lt;ref name="centres"/&gt; and also in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="czech-centre"/&gt; These serve primarily as a base for A Rocha’s and other organizations’ field studies and for environmental education, and most also offer accommodation for visitors.

Areas of A Rocha’s work include:

* Species and landscape surveying and monitoring, such as [[Avian ecology field methods#Basic counts|raptor counts]] in [[Pembina Valley]], [[Canada]],&lt;ref name="mordentimes-raptors"/&gt; [[camera trap]]ping of mammals in India,&lt;ref name="camera-trapping"/&gt; the Kenya Bird Map,&lt;ref name="kenya-birdmap"/&gt; dry [[grassland]] biodiversity surveys in Switzerland&lt;ref name="switzerland-surveys"/&gt; and mapping tropical forests using [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s&lt;ref name="mapping-tropforests"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vagliolaurin-biodiv"/&gt;
* Habitat and species restoration projects, such as mangrove restoration projects in Ghana,&lt;ref name="ghana-mangrove"/&gt; and improving breeding chances for [[Grey-faced petrel]]s by eradicating invasive mammals, restoring habitats and deploying artificial nests in [[Raglan, New Zealand]]&lt;ref name="stuff-oi"/&gt;
* Reducing [[human–wildlife conflict]] in India, notably with elephants&lt;ref name="sluka-christians"/&gt;&lt;ref name="varma-elephant"/&gt; and leopards&lt;ref name="bangalore-leopard"/&gt;
* Setting up private or public parks and reserves such as the Kirosa Scott Reserve in Kenya,&lt;ref name="kenya-dakatcha"/&gt; and Foxearth Reserve&lt;ref name="uk-foxearth"/&gt; and [[Minet Country Park]] in the UK
* Enlarging and campaigning for the safeguarding of existing natural and protected areas, such as the [[Atewa Range|Atewa Forest]] in Ghana,&lt;ref name="saveatewa"/&gt; and the [[Alvor (Portimão)#Geography|Alvor Estuary]] in Portugal&lt;ref name="lapidomedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="portugal-resident"/&gt;
* Bridging biodiversity conservation and sustainable livelihoods, such as via sustainable agriculture and community garden projects across Canada;&lt;ref name="canada-sustainable-agriculture"/&gt; the Arabuko-Sokoke Schools and Eco-tourism Scheme in Kenya;&lt;ref name="sluka-christians"/&gt;&lt;ref name="assets-thesis"/&gt; the establishment of CREMAs ([[Environmental resource management|community resource management]] areas) around [[Mole National Park]]&lt;ref name="sluka-christians"/&gt; and [[Lake Bosumtwi]],&lt;ref name="crema-bosumtwi"/&gt; Ghana; and training community members in Uganda to construct bio-sand [[water filter]]s&lt;ref name="biosand-filters"/&gt;
* Environmental education activities and resources, such as the Wild Lebanon website in Lebanon&lt;ref name="wildlebanon"/&gt; and “[[creation care]] camps” in the USA&lt;ref name="us-ccc"/&gt;
* [[Carbon footprint]] reduction and mitigation projects, such as producing charcoal briquettes from waste in Uganda,&lt;ref name="uganda-briquettes"/&gt; the “Eco Church” church [[greening]] programme in the UK,&lt;ref name="stpauls-ecochurch"/&gt; and running “Climate Stewards”, a global programme which encourages people to reduce their carbon footprint, and accepts donations to offset emissions via community forestry and cookstove projects in Ghana, Kenya and Mexico&lt;ref name="climatestewards"/&gt;
* Cooperating worldwide for nature conservation, such as being a member of [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]]&lt;ref name="iucn-members"/&gt; and IUCN’s European Habitats Forum&lt;ref name="iucn-ehf"/&gt;
* Engaging Christian communities with the relevance of nature conservation to the Christian faith, through conferences,&lt;ref name="regent-conference"/&gt; speaking engagements,&lt;ref name="iucn-peter-talk"/&gt; books&lt;ref name="postcards-middle-east"/&gt; and papers,&lt;ref name="jubilee-bible-biodiversity"/&gt; and partnerships such as the [[Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization|Lausanne]]/[[World Evangelical Alliance|WEA]] Creation Care Network&lt;ref name="lwccn"/&gt;

A Rocha also serves as an [[Erasmus+]] / [[European Voluntary Service]] agency in France,&lt;ref name="erasmus-FR"/&gt; the Netherlands&lt;ref name="erasmus-NL"/&gt; and Portugal.&lt;ref name="erasmus-PT"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1943">'''Agbagli Kossi''' (1935-1991)  was a [[Togo]]lese sculptor, whose work was representative of the West African [[Vodun art]] tradition. He was born in [[Bè]], a district of [[Lomé]], and became an eminent figure among the vodou circles of Togo.&lt;ref name="Chesi1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chesi|first=Gert|title=Voodoo: Africa's Secret Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gY7XAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Perlinger|isbn=978-3-85399-013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly noted for his little wooden voodoo figures, painted mostly with pink lacquer, and occasionally white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caacart.com/pigozzi-artist.php?i=Kossi-Agbagli&amp;bio=en&amp;m=68|title= Agbagli Kossi|publisher=Caacart.com|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced many examples of statuettes of twins, and children with their mothers, known as ''venavi''.&lt;ref name="MagninSoulillou1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magnin|first1=André|last2=Soulillou|first2=Jacques|title=Contemporary Art of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLBPAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=H.N.

Kossi exhibited at the [[Magiciens de la terre]] exhibition at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]]  in Paris in 1989 and in 1991 his work was shown at an exhibition in [[Centro Atlántico de Arte Moderno]], in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], Spain. In 2008 his work appeared at the Mami Wata: Arts for Water Spirits in Africa and Its Diasporas showcasing at the [[Fowler Museum]] of [[UCLA]] in Los Angeles. Today, his work is represented in [[The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2531">'''Agents of Roman Congregations''' are persons whose business it is to look after the affairs of their patrons at the [[Roman Curia]].

The name is derived from the Latin [[Agens in Rebus]], corresponding to the Greek [[Apocrisiarius]] (both have specific historical secular uses in the Roman/ Byzantine empires).

We first meet these agents for ecclesiastical matters not at the court of Rome, but at the imperial palace of Constantinople. Owing to the close connection between Church and State under the early Christian emperors and the absence of canons concerning many matters of mixed jurisdiction, the principal bishops found it necessary to maintain agents to look after their interests at the imperial court. Until the [[French Revolution]], the prelates of France maintained similar agents at the royal court of St. Denis. (See [[Assembly of the French clergy]].)

In modern times the agents of the Roman Congregations are employed by bishops or private persons to transact their affairs in the pontifical courts. Such an agency is undertaken temporarily or perpetually. The principal business of the agents is to urge the expedition of the cases of their patrons. They undertake both judicial and extrajudicial business. If it is a question of papal favors, such as [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]]s or increased faculties, these agents prepare the proper supplications and call repeatedly on the officials of the proper congregation until an answer is obtained. They expend whatever money is necessary to pay for the legal documents or to advance in general the affairs of those who employ them.

The agents have a recognized position in the Roman Curia, and rank next in dignity before the [[apostolic notary|apostolic notaries]]. The money they expend and the pay they receive depend entirely on the will of their employers.

Some authors include under this name the [[solicitor]]s and [[apostolic expeditor]]s of the Roman Curia, whose business it is to assist the [[Procurator (Catholic Church)|procurators]] in the mechanical details of the preparation of cases for the congregational tribunals. Usually, however, these functionaries are considered as distinct from agents and as outranking them in dignity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2023">'''Al-hurra''' or '''al hurra''' (etymologically: 'Free Woman') was an Arabic title historically often given to, or used to referred to, women who exercised power or had a position of power or high status.

In a [[harem]], the title al-hurra was often used to refer to a legal wife of aristocratic birth, to distinguish her status from that of the [[concubine]] bought at the [[slave]] market, who was referred to as ''jarya'',&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Mernissi, Fatima; Mary Jo Lakeland (2003). The forgotten queens of Islam. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-579868-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and used to describe a Muslim aristocratic woman who was "free" in the sense that she was not a slave;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; it is related to the style ''[[Sayyida]]'' (Mistress or lady), the feminine word of ''[[sayyid]]'' (Master or Lord).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, while the title Al-hurra was given to women as an alternative to the titles ''[[Malika (given name)|malika]]'' (Queen), ''[[Sultana (title)|Sultana]]'' (female sultan) and ''Sitt'', (Lady), there was no exact male equivalent to the title of al-hurra.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The title Al-hurra was often granted to women who wielded political power, but did not necessarily mean they were sovereigns: [[Alam al-Malika]] and [[Sayyida al Hurra]], for example, bore this title.  Both had political offices; not as sovereigns, but as political adviser and governor respectively.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''''Amen''''' is an American [[sitcom]] produced by [[Carson Entertainment|Carson Productions]] that aired on [[NBC]] from September 27, 1986 to May 11, 1991. Set in [[Sherman Hemsley]]'s real-life hometown of [[Philadelphia]], ''Amen'' stars Hemsley as the [[deacon]] of a church and was part of a wave of successful sitcoms on [[NBC]] in the 1980s and early 1990s which featured predominantly [[Black people|black]] casts – others included ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[A Different World]]'', ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', and ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Look At New TV Season|journal=Ebony|date=October 1986|volume=41|issue=12|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeDIr9Ni0uAC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=amen+sherman+hemsley#v=onepage&amp;q=amen%20sherman%20hemsley&amp;f=false|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|issn=0012-9011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is often dishonest and frequently gets into trouble with his many harebrained schemes. Frye has a single daughter named Thelma. Reuben Gregory is the new, young pastor of the church, and also the object of Thelma's affection. The two get married during season four, despite the fact that Gregory and Frye often butt heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collier|first=Aldore|title=Clifton Davis and Anna Marie Horsford Tie Knot On TV's 'Amen'|journal=Jet|date=February 5, 1990|volume=77|issue=17|pages=60–61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=amen+sherman+hemsley#v=onepage&amp;q=amen%20sherman%20hemsley&amp;f=false|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the series finale, Thelma gives birth to the couple's first child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title="Deliverance" Episode Ends Fifth Season of "Amen"|journal=Jet|date=May 13, 1991|volume=80|issue=4|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QK8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=amen+sherman+hemsley#v=onepage&amp;q=amen%20sherman%20hemsley&amp;f=false|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frye's legal career is the subject of many jokes and storylines.  A few episodes deal with Frye defending the church or other main characters in legal battles.

==Exterior shot location==
During the 1980's, the beautiful stone Gothic walls of Mount Pisgah African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia appeared on prime time television as the fictional "First Community Church". Consequently, the Church became known to the nation as the "''Amen'' Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtpisgahamec.org/church_history1|title=Mt. Pisgah A.M.E.

'''Baodingshan''' [Ch. 宝顶山／ 寶頂山 also known as Mount Baoding, Precious Summit Mountain, and Summit of Treasures] is a Buddhist site in [[Chongqing]]. The site is located on a limestone outcropping at an elevation of 500 meters, fifteen kilometers north of the city of [[Dazu District|Dazu]], a market town that dates to 758 CE and the city is ringed by religious sites dating from 892 to 1249 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dazu xian zhi: Sichuan sheng (Dazu Gazetteer: Sichuan Province)|date=1976|publisher=Chengwen chuban she|location=Taibei}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary construction at Baodingshan took place during the [[Southern Song Dynasty]] (1127-1279 CE) but it remained largely unknown to the outside world until its reopening to the public in the 1980s, the earliest documented research on the site dating to 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Jialuo|title=The Discovery (1945) of 6216 Statues Carved on Rocks During the T'ang and Sung Dynasties at Ta Tsu|date=1968|publisher=Encyclopedia Sinica|location=Taibei}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has since been designated a World Heritage Site since 1999, falling within the collective grouping of [[Dazu Rock Carvings]], a reference to the district in which Baodingshan is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dazu Rock Carvings|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/912/|website=UNESCO World Heritage Sites|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dazu County covers 1400 square kilometers northwest of Chongqing on the road to [[Chengdu]]. During the [[Song Dynasty culture|Song Dynasty]] (960–1279 CE), this area of the Chengdu plain was considered one of the wealthiest regions in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lo|first1=Winston W.|title=Szechwan in Sung China: A Case Study in the Political Integration of the Chinese Empire|date=1982|publisher=University of Chinese Culture Press|location=Taibei|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consisting of a mile and a half of carvings, numbering over 6000 total, Baodingshan is an atypical Chinese Buddhist site for a variety of reasons: it includes both large scale iconic works as well as intricate narrative tableaux; it represents a variety of Buddhist schools of thought – [[Huayan school|Huayan]], [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]], [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]], and [[Esoteric Buddhism|Esoteric]]; it has copious amounts of Buddhist texts carved in conjunction with imagery; and it was constructed within 70 years under the supervision of one man, Zhao Zhifeng (赵智风).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Art Museum of Dazu Stone Carvings of Chongqing and the Institute of Dazu  Stone Carvings Art of Sichuan Provincial Academy of Social Science|title=Dazu shike mingwen lu. (The Collected Inscriptions from the Dazu Stone Carvings)|date=1999|publisher=Chongqing chubanshe|location=Chongqing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baodingshan consists of two main parts joined by a temple, Shengshousi [Sagacious Longevity Temple 圣手寺／ 聖壽寺]. Best known to the outside world is Great Buddha Bend [Dafowan大佛弯／大佛彎] due to its impressive collection of 31 tableaux featuring imagery such as the parinirvana of the historical Buddha, the hells scenes, the Peacock Queen and numerous other narrative tableaux, the most widely reproduced being the Taming the Wild Ox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kucera|first1=Karil J|title=Hoping for Heaven, Landing in Hell: Lessons Learned at a Medieval Chinese Grotto|journal=At the Interface: Probing the Boundaries|date=2006|volume=4|pages=261–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great Buddha Bend also claims some of the biggest Chinese versions of certain Buddhist works – in particular the Hell tableau and the 1000-Armed 1000-Eyed Avalokitesvara or Guanyin figure. This area of Baodingshan follows the natural contours of the landscape, a rocky semi-circle formed by the nearby river. At Great Buddha Bend, the carved works flow from one tableau into another—large, deeply cut reliefs reaching dimensions as great as 26 feet high by 66 feet wide. Visitors encounter an uninterrupted series of carvings totaling 30 connected tableaux punctuated by two caves, giving the illusion of a handscroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Buddha Bend Interactive Tour|url=http://www.baodingshan.org|website=Baodingshan|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several authors have even likened Baodingshan’s Great Buddha Bend to “an illustrated storybook."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paludan|first1=Ann|title=Enlightenment in stone: The buffalo carvings of Baodingshan,|journal=Apollo|date=February 1994|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Hua|title=The Splendour of the Grotto Arts of the Later Period in China,|journal=Oriental Art|date=Spring 1989|issue=n.s., 35|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kucera|first1=Karil J|title=Lessons in Stone: Baodingshan and its Hell Imagery|date=1995|publisher=MA thesis|location=University of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious difference between Great Buddha Bend and other Chinese cave sites is the lack of caves, or even cave-like niches, in which the statues would normally be positioned. Caves at Buddhist sites such as [[Dunhuang Grottoes|Dunhuang]] and [[Yungang Grottoes|Yungang]] were seen as a necessary part of the religious process. They were places where the worshipper entered into a “Buddha-world” and performed rites of circumambulation or made offerings to an icon.

The other area of Baodingshan is Little Buddha Bend [Xiaofowan 小佛弯／小佛彎], a smaller area situated above and behind the temple where some scholars have argued initiation rituals were carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howard|first1=Angela Falco|title=Summit of Treasures|date=2001|publisher=Weatherhill|location=Trumbull, CT|pages=77–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is within Little Buddha Bend that one finds the Founder’s Pagoda, a carved work on which is seen images of the Tang dynasty local layman Master Liu – famous for his ten austerities that are depicted at Baodingshan as well as at other sites in Sichuan - as well as an image of Zhao Zhifeng, the monk credited with Baodingshan’s creation. Equally important is the inclusion of a carved Buddhist scriptural catalogue on the lower levels of the pagoda, with some scholars noting that the catalogue’s presence points to perhaps a different function for the text seen at the site as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Kucera|first1 = Karil J|title = Ritual and Representation in Chinese Buddhism: Visualizing Enlightenment at Baodingshan from the 12th to the 21st Centuries|date = 2016|publisher = Cambria Press|location = Amherst, NY|pages = chapter 7|url = http://www.cambriapress.com/books/9781604979176.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of Baodingshan include the Vimalakirti Hall, situated at the pinnacle of the summit, and the Longevity Pavilion located just above the Oxherding sequence of texts and images in Great Buddha Bend.

Baodingshan has seen considerable growth in the last decade, with a new highway being built to Dazu from Chongqing to speed up access and new buildings and roads being constructed at Baodingshan itself. Scholarship on the site has also increased, from only minimal treatment of the site by Chinese scholars in the form of archaeological assessment being done up until the 1980s to volumes of essays being published annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liu|first1=Changjiu, ed.|title=Dazu shike yanjiu (Research on Dazu Rock Carvings)|date=1985|publisher=Sichuan sheng shehui kexueyuan chubanshe|location=Chengdu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Western language work by H. Sorensen, A. Howard and K.

The '''''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad''''' ({{lang-sa|बृहदारण्यक उपनिषद्}}, {{IAST|Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad}})  is one of the [[Mukhya Upanishads|Principal Upanishads]] and one of the oldest Upanishadic scriptures of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], [https://archive.org/stream/philosophyofupan00deus#page/22/mode/2up The Philosophy of the Upanishads], Motilal Banarsidass (2011 Edition), {{ISBN|978-8120816206}}, page 23&lt;/ref&gt; A key scripture to various schools of [[Hinduism]], the ''Brihadaranyaka Upanisad'' is tenth in the [[Muktikā]] or "canon of 108 Upanishads".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814691}}, pages 556-557&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' is estimated to have been composed about 700 BCE, excluding some parts estimated to have been composed after the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, Patrick . ''Upaniṣhads.'' Oxford University Press, 1998, pages 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sanskrit]] language text is contained within the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'', which is itself a part of the [[Yajurveda#Shukla Yajurveda|Shukla Yajur Veda]].&lt;ref name="EoH 93"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Constance|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0816073368|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' is a treatise on [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] (Soul, Self), includes passages on [[metaphysics]], ethics and a yearning for knowledge that influenced various [[Indian religions]], ancient and medieval scholars, and attracted secondary works such as those by [[Madhvacharya]] and [[Adi Shankara]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n0/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad with Adi Shankara's commentary] Swami Madhavananada (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brihadaranyaka Upanisad with the commentary of Madhvacharya, Translated by Rai Bahadur Sriśa Chandra Vasu (1933), {{oclc|222634127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
The chronology of ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'', like other Upanishads, is uncertain and contested.&lt;ref name=stephenphillips&gt;Stephen Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231144858}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; The chronology is difficult to resolve because all opinions rest on scanty evidence, an analysis of archaism, style and repetitions across texts, driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas, and on presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=stephenphillips/&gt; Patrick Olivelle states, "in spite of claims made by some, in reality, any dating of these documents (early Upanishads) that attempts a precision closer than a few centuries is as stable as a house of cards".&lt;ref name=olivelleintro/&gt;

The chronology and authorship of ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'', along with ''Chandogya'' and [[Kaushitaki Upanishad|''Kaushitaki Upanishads'']], is further complicated because they are compiled anthologies of literature that must have existed as independent texts before they became part of these Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2014), The Early Upanishads, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195124354}}, page 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact year, and even the century of the Upanishad composition is unknown. Scholars have offered different estimates ranging from 900 BCE to 600 BCE, all preceding Buddhism. ''Brihadaranyaka'' is one of the oldest Upanishads, along with that of [[Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana|''Jaiminiya Upanishad'']] and ''Chandogya Upanishads''.&lt;ref name=patricko&gt;Olivelle, Patrick (1998), Upaniṣads, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-282292-6}}, pages 10-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fujii, M. 1997, “On the Formation and Transmission of the Jaiminīya-Upaniṣad-Brāhmaṇa”, Inside the Texts, Beyond the Texts: New Approaches to the Study of the Vedas, ed. M. Witzel, [[Harvard Oriental Series]], Opera Minora, 2], Cambridge, 89–102&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' was in all likelihood composed in the earlier part of 1st millennium BCE, around 700 BCE, give or take a century or so, according to Patrick Olivelle.&lt;ref name=olivelleintro&gt;[[Patrick Olivelle]] (2014), The Early Upanishads, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195124354}}, page 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the text was a living document and some verses were edited over a period of time before the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref name=patricko/&gt;

==Etymology and structure==
[[File:Biogradska suma.jpg|left|thumb|Brihadaranyaka Upanishad literally means the "Upanishad of the great forests".]]
The title ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' literally means "great wilderness or forest Upaniṣhad". It is credited to ancient sage [[Yajnavalkya]], but likely refined by a number of ancient Vedic scholars. The Upanishad forms the last part, that is the fourteenth ''kānda'' of ''Śatapatha Brāhmana'' of "Śhukla Yajurveda".&lt;ref name=pauldeussen/&gt; The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad has six ''adhyayas'' (chapters) in total. There are two major recensions for the text - the Madhyandina and the Kanva recensions. It includes three sections: ''Madhu kānda'' (the 4th and 5th chapter of the fourteenth ''kānda'' of Satapatha Brahmana), ''Muni kānda'' (or ''Yajnavalkya Kanda'', the 6th and 7th chapter of 14th ''kānda'' of Satapatha Brahmana) and ''Khila kānda'' (the 8th and 9th chapter of the fourteenth ''kānda'' of Satapatha Brahmana).&lt;ref name=pauldeussen&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 389-397&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 80|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first and second chapters of the Upanishad's ''Madhu kānda'' consists of six [[brahmana]]ms each, with varying number of hymns per brahmanam. The first chapter of the Upanishad's ''Yajnavalkya kānda'' consists of nine brahmanams, while the second has six brahmanams. The ''Khila kānda'' of the Upanishad has fifteen brahmanams in its first chapter, and five brahmanams in the second chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 399-544&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
===First chapter===
The ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' starts by stating one of many Vedic theories of creation of the universe. It asserts that there was nothing before the universe started, then [[Prajapati]] created from this nothing the universe as a sacrifice to himself, imbued it with ''Prana'' (life force) to preserve it in the form of cosmic inert matter and individual psychic energy.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n41/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Chapter 1], Translator: S Madhavananda, pages 5-29&lt;/ref&gt; The world is more than matter and energy, asserts Brihadaranyaka, it is constituted also of Atman or Brahman (Soul, Self, Consciousness, Invisible Principles and Reality) as well as Knowledge.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen/&gt;

The Brahmana 4 in the first chapter, announces the Upanishad's non-dual, [[monism|monistic]] metaphysical premise that Atman and Brahman are identical Oneness, with the assertion that because the universe came out of nothingness when the only principle existent was "I am he", the universe after it came into existence continues as ''Aham brahma asmi'' (I am Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n41/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Chapter 1], Translator: S Madhavananda, pages 92-118&lt;/ref&gt; In the last brahmana of the first chapter, the Upanishad explains that the Atman (soul) inspires by being self-evident (name identity), through empowering forms, and through action (work of a living being). The Soul, states Brihadaranyaka, is the imperishable one that is invisible and concealed pervading all reality.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen/&gt;

===Second chapter===
The ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' starts the second chapter as a conversation between [[Ajatashatru]] and ''Balaki Gargya'' on theory of dreams, positing that human beings see dreams entirely unto themselves because mind draws, in itself, the powers of sensory organs, which it releases in the waking state.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen/&gt; It then asserts that this empirical fact about dreams suggests that human mind has the power to perceive the world as it is, as well as fabricate the world as it wants to perceive it. Mind is a means, prone to flaws. The struggle man faces, asserts Brihadaranyaka in brahmana 3, is in his attempt to realize the "true reality behind perceived reality". That is Atman-Brahman, inherently and blissfully existent, yet unknowable because it has no qualities, no characteristics, it is "neti, neti" (literally, "not that, not that").&lt;ref name=pauldeussen/&gt;

In fourth brahmana, the Upanishad presents a dialogue between a husband and wife, as Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi, on nature of love and spirituality, whether and how is Atman related to deep connection and bonds between human beings. Yajnavalkya states that one doesn't connect with and love forms, nor does one connect or love mind, rather one connects with the Self, the Soul of one's own and one's beloved. All love is for the sake of one's Self, and the Oneness one realizes in the Self of the beloved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n41/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Chapter 2 Section IV], Translator: S Madhavananda, pages 347-377&lt;/ref&gt; He then asserts that this knowledge of the Soul, the Self, the Brahman is what makes one immortal, the connection immortal. All longing is the longing for the Soul, because Soul is the true, the immortal, the real and the infinite bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 425-445&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth brahmana of the second chapter introduces the ''Madhu theory'', thus giving this section of the Upanishad the ancient name ''Madhu Khanda''.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen2/&gt; The ''Madhu theory'' is one of the foundational principles of [[Vedanta]] schools of Hinduism, as well as other [[Āstika and nāstika|āstika]] schools of Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=madhavanandamadhu/&gt; ''Madhu'' literally means "honey", or the composite fruit of numerous actions on the field of flowers. In the ''Madhu theory'', notes [[Paul Deussen]],&lt;ref name=pauldeussen2/&gt; the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad asserts that "Atman exists" (soul exists), that all organic beings (plants, animals, human beings and gods) are wandering souls yet One with each other and the Brahman (Cosmic Soul); it further asserts that inorganic nature (fire, air, earth, water, space) is the field where the beings act, and where their numerous actions create fruits that they separately and together experience. The Upanishad then states that everything is connected, beings affect each other, organic beings affect the inorganic nature, inorganic nature affects the organic beings, one is the "honey" (result, fruit, food) of the other, everyone and everything is mutually dependent, nourishing and nurturing each other, all because it came from one Brahman, because it is all one Brahman, because all existence is blissful oneness.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen2&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 437-443&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=madhavanandamadhu&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n41/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Chapter 2 Section IV], Translator: S Madhavananda, pages 377-404&lt;/ref&gt; This theory appears in various early and middle Upanishads, and parallels [[Immanuel Kant]]'s doctrine of "the affinity of phenomena" built on "the synthetic unity of [[apperception]]".&lt;ref name=pauldeussen2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Jacobs (1999), The Principal Upanishads: The Essential Philosophical Foundation of Hinduism, Watkins, {{ISBN|978-1905857081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last brahmanam of the Upanishad's first section is a ''Vamsa'' (generational line of teachers) with the names of 57 Vedic scholars who are credited to have taught the ''Madhu Khanda'' from one generation to the next.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe15/sbe15063.htm Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad] The [[Sacred Books of the East]], Volume 15, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third chapter===
The third chapter is a metaphysical dialogue between ten ancient sages, on the nature of Reality, Atman and [[Moksha|Mukti]]. Paul Deussen calls the presentation of ancient scholar Yajnavalkya in this chapter "not dissimilar to that of Socrates in the dialogues of Plato".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 443-445&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the chapter presents the theory of perceived empirical knowledge using the concepts of ''graha and atigraha'' (sensory action and sense). It lists 8 combinations of graha and atigraha: breath and smell, speech and name (ideas), tongue and taste, eye and form, ear and sound, skin and touch, mind and desire, arms and work respectively.&lt;ref name=maxmuller3/&gt; The sages debate the nature of death, asserts the third chapter of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, and whether any graha and atigraha prevails after one dies. They rule out six, then assert that one's ideas (name) and one's actions and work (karma) continues to affect the universe.&lt;ref name=maxmuller3&gt;Max Muller, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe15/sbe15065.htm Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad] The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 15, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 448-449&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth brahmana of the third chapter asserts, "it is your soul which is inside all", all souls are one, immanent and transcendent. The fifth brahmana states that profound knowledge requires that one give up showing off one's erudition, then adopt childlike curiosity and simplicity, followed by becoming silent, meditating and observant (''muni''), thus beginning the journey towards profound knowledge, understanding the soul of things where there is freedom from frustration and sorrow.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen5/&gt; In the sixth and eighth brahmana of the third chapter in Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad is the dialogue between [[Gargi Vachaknavi]] – the female Vedic sage, and Yajñavalka, on the nature of universe.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen5&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 450-457&lt;/ref&gt;

The seventh brahmana discusses how and why the soul interconnects and has the oneness through all organic beings, all inorganic nature, all of universe. It asserts that the soul is the inner controller of beings, conflated with the interaction of nature, psyche and senses, often without the knowledge of beings. It is the soul, nevertheless, that is the true and essence, states the Upanishad.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 457-465&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth brahmana, the longest of the third chapter, introduces the "neti, neti" principle that is discussed later, along with the analogical equivalence of physical features of a man and those of a tree, with the root of a man being his soul.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen475&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 466-475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n145/mode/2up Kausitaki Upanishad] Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, pages 125-127&lt;/ref&gt; The last hymns of chapter 3 in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad also attest to the prevalent practice of the renouncing [[sannyasa|ascetic]] life by the time Brihadaranyaka Upanishad was composed in Vedic age of India, and it is these ascetic circles that are credited for major movements such as [[Yoga]] as well as the [[śramaṇa]] traditions later to be called [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and heterodox [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel (2008), The Origins of Yoga and Tantra, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521695343}}, page 8, Quote: such (yogic) practices developed in the same ascetic circles as the early śramaṇa movements (Buddhists, Jainas and Ajivikas), probably in around the sixth or fifth BCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth chapter===
The fourth chapter of ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' starts as a dialogue between King Janaka and Yajnavalka. It explores various aspects of the "Soul exists" theory, its phenomenal manifestations, and its philosophical implications on [[soteriology]]. The Upanishad, in the first brahmanam of fourth chapter, states that the soul manifests in human life in six forms: ''Prajna'' (consciousness), ''Priyam'' (love and the will to live), ''Satyam'' (reverence for truth, reality), ''Ananta'' (endlessness, curiosity for the eternal), ''Ananda'' (bliss, contentness), and ''Sthiti'' (the state of enduring steadfastness, calm perseverance).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenc4b2&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 475-507&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second brahmanam, the Upanishad explores the question, "what happens to soul after one dies?", and provides the root of two themes that play central role in later schools of Hinduism: one, of the concept of soul as individual souls (dualism), and second of the concept of soul being One and Eternal neither comes nor goes anywhere, because it is everywhere and everyone in Oneness (non-dualism). This chapter discusses the widely cited "neti, neti" (नेति नेति, "not this, not this") principle towards one's journey to understanding soul. The second brahmanam concludes that soul exists is self-evident, soul is blissfully free, soul is eternally invulnerable, and soul is indescribable knowledge.&lt;ref name=pauldeussenc4b2/&gt;

The hymn 4.2.4 of ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' is one of many instances in the ancient Sanskrit text where the characters involved in philosophical debate greet each other with [[Namaste]] (नमस्ते), a practice in the [[culture of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n617/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka 4.2.4] S Madhavananda (Translator), pages 590-592&lt;/ref&gt;

The third brahmanam of the fourth chapter discusses the premises of [[moksha]] (liberation, freedom, emancipation, self-realization), and provides some of the most studied hymns of Brihadaranyaka. Paul Deussen calls it, "unique in its richness and warmth of presentation", with profoundness that retains its full worth in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 482&lt;/ref&gt; Max Muller translates it as follows,

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
But when he [Self] fancies that he is, as it were, a god,
or that he is, as it were, a king,
or "I am this altogether," that is his highest world,
This indeed is his (true) form, free from desires, free from evil, free from fear.

Now as a man, when embraced by a beloved wife,
knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within,
thus this person, when embraced by the ''Prajna'' (conscious, aware) Self,
knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within.
This indeed is his (true) form, in which his wishes are fulfilled,
in which the Self only is his wish, in which no other wish is left,
he is free from any sorrow.

Then a father is not a father, a mother not a mother,
the worlds not worlds, the gods not gods, the Vedas not Vedas.
Then a thief is not a thief, a murderer not a murderer,
a Sramana not a Sramana, a Tâpasa not a Tâpasa.
He is not affected by good, not affected by evil,
for he has then overcome all sorrows, all sufferings.
(...)
Thus did Yâgñavalkya teach him.
This is his highest Goal,
this is his highest Success,
this is his highest World,
this is his highest Bliss.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Chapter 4, Brahmanam 3, Hymns 20-32, Translated by Max Muller&lt;ref name=maxmullerc4b3&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe15/sbe15075.htm Brihadaranyaka Upanishad] Max Muller, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 15, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The fourth brahmanam continues to build the thematic description of Atman-Brahman (Self, Soul) and the state of self-realization as achieved. Yajnavalkya declares that Knowledge is Self, Knowledge is freedom, Knowledge powers inner peace. In hymn 4.4.22, the Upanishad states, "He is that great unborn Self, who consists of Knowledge, is surrounded by the Prânas (life-force), the ether within the heart. In it [Soul] there reposes the ruler of all, the lord of all, the king of all. He does not become greater by good works, nor smaller by evil works. He is the lord of all, the king of all things, the protector of all things. He is a bank and a boundary, so that these worlds may not be confounded. He who knows him [soul], becomes a Muni. Wishing for that world, mendicants leave their homes."&lt;ref name=maxmullerc4b3/&gt;

Max Muller and Paul Deussen, in their respective translations, describe the Upanishad's view of "Soul, Self" and "free, liberated state of existence" as, "[Self] is imperishable, for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail. He is beyond good and evil, and neither what he has done, nor what he has omitted to do, affects him. (...) He therefore who knows it [reached self-realization], becomes quiet, subdued, satisfied, patient, and collected. He sees self in Self, sees all as Self. Evil does not overcome him, he overcomes all evil. Evil does not burn him, he burns all evil. Free from evil, free from spots, free from doubt, he became Atman-Brâhmana; this is the Brahma-world, O King, thus spoke Yagnavalkya."&lt;ref name=pauldeussenc4b2/&gt;&lt;ref name=maxmullerc4b3/&gt;

The last brahmanam of the Upanishad's second section is another ''Vamsa'' (generational line of teachers) with the names of 59 Vedic scholars who are credited to have taught the hymns of ''Muni Khanda'' from one generation to the next, before its became part of Brihadaranyaka.&lt;ref name=pauldeussenc4b2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe15/sbe15078.htm Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad] The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 15, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fifth and sixth chapters===
The fifth and sixth chapters of ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' are known as ''Khila Khanda'', which literally means "supplementary section, or appendix".&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe15/sbe15079.htm Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad] The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 15, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Each brahmanam in the supplement is small except the fourteenth. This section, suggests Paul Deussen, was likely written later to clarify and add ideas considered important in that later age.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 507&lt;/ref&gt;

Some brahmanams in the last section of ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'', such as the second and third brahmanam in fifth chapter, append ethical theories, while fourth brahmanam in the fifth chapter asserts that "empirical reality and truth is Brahman".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 509-510&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth brahmanam of sixth chapter, sexual rituals between a husband and wife are described to conceive and celebrate the birth of a child.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 534-544&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
{{Hindu scriptures |expanded=Upanishads}}
The Brihadaranyaka text has been an important Upanishad to the Vedanta scholars, and discusses many early concepts and theories foundational to Hinduism such as Karma, Atman and others.&lt;ref name=tull28/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans Torwesten|title=Vedanta: Heart of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWptZtEa0hcC&amp;pg=PA55|year=1994|publisher=Grove |isbn=978-0-8021-3262-8|pages=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karma theory===
One of the earliest formulation of the [[Karma]] doctrine occurs in the ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad''.&lt;ref name=tull28&gt;Tull, Herman W. The Vedic Origins of Karma: Cosmos as Man in Ancient Indian Myth and Ritual. SUNY Series in Hindu Studies. P. 28&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
''Now as a man is like this or like that,
''according as he acts and according as he behaves, so will he be;
''a man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts, bad;
''he became pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds;

''And here they say that a person consists of desires,
''and as is his desire, so is his will;
''and as is his will, so is his deed;
''and whatever deed he does, that he will reap.

===Psychology===
The verses in the Upanishad contain theories pertaining to [[psychology]] and human motivations.&lt;ref&gt;Aron &amp; Aron (1996), Love and expansion of the self: The state of the model, Personal Relationships, 3(1), pages 45-58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Masek and Lewandowski (2013), The self expansion model of motivation and cognition, in The Oxford Handbook of Close Relationships (Editors: Simpson and Campbell), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195398694}}, page 111&lt;/ref&gt; Verse 1.4.17 describes the desire for progeny as the desire to be born again. The Upanishad states a behavioral theory, linking action to nature, suggesting that behavioral habits makes a man,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
According as one acts, so does he become.
One becomes virtuous by virtuous action,
bad by bad action.
— Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayanacademy.com/basics/fourf/ Four facts of Hinduism]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ancient and medieval Indian scholars have referred to ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' as a foundation to discuss psychological theories, the nature of psyche, and how body, mind and soul interact. For example, Adi Shankara in his commentary on the ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' explains the relation between consciousness, the mind and the body.&lt;ref&gt;KR Rao (2005), Perception, cognition and consciousness in classical Hindu psychology. Journal of Consciousness Studies, 12(3), pages 3-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RH Trowbridge (2011), Waiting for Sophia: 30 years of conceptualizing wisdom in empirical psychology. Research in Human Development, 8(2), pages 149-164&lt;/ref&gt;

Mind creates desire, asserts ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'', with its basis in pleasure.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Eye is the cause of material wealth, because it is through sight that wealth is created states the Upanishad, while ears are spiritual wealth, because it is through listening that knowledge is shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brhadaranyaka Upanisad with commentary of Sankaracarya|last=Swami Madhavananda|url=https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n219/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Upanishad suggests in the dialogue between Yajnavalkya and [[Maitreyi]], husband and wife, that one does not love an object for the sake of the object but for the sake of the subject, the Self (the soul of the other person).

===Metaphysics===
Verse 1.3.28 acknowledges that metaphysical statements in Upanishads are meant to guide the reader from unreality to reality. The metaphysics of ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' is non-dualism ([[Advaita]]). For instance, in verse 2.4.13 Yajnavalkya asserts that everything in the universe is the Self. The nature of reality or Self is described as consciousness-bliss in verse 3.9.28. Neti-neti or (not this—not this) is a method of emphasizing the discovery of the right, by excluding the wrong. The verse 5.1 states that the Universe, Reality and Consciousness is infinite.

:पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते ।
:पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥

:''pūrṇam adaḥ, pūrṇam idaṃ, pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate''
:''pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate''.

:"That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite. the infinite proceeds from the infinite.
: (Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe), it remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone."
:::::::::::::::::Translation by [[Swami Madhavananda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brhadaranyaka Upanisad with commentary of Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|quote=The Peace Chant|url=https://archive.org/details/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"From infinite or fullness, we can get only fullness or infinite". The above verse describes the nature of the Absolute or [[Brahman]] which is infinite or full, i.e., it contains everything. Upanishadic metaphysics is further elucidated in the [[Madhu-vidya]] (honey doctrine), where the essence of every object is described to be same to the essence of every other object. The ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' looks at reality as being indescribable and its nature to be infinite and consciousness-bliss. The cosmic energy is thought to integrate in the microcosm and in the macrocosm integrate the individual to the universe.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Different interpretations===
{{expand section|date=April 2017}}
The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad has attracted secondary literature and commentaries (''[[bhasya]]'') from many scholars. In these secondary texts, the same passages have been interpreted in different ways by the various sub-schools of Vedanta such as nondualistic [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] (monism), dualistic [[Dvaita]] (theism) and qualified nondualistic [[Vishistadvaita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6hwNAQAAIAAJ |year=1988| publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-1866-4|pages=39–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madhva|title=The Principal Upaniṣads: Chandogya-Brihadaranyaka|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DVUpAAAAYAAJ|year =1999|publisher= Dvaita Vedanta Studies and Research Foundation|pages=i–iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1894">The '''Buddhist Federation of Norway''' (Norwegian: '''Buddhistforbundet''') is an umbrella organization for the different [[Buddhist]] groups in [[Norway]].  It was founded in 1979 by two Buddhist groups (Rinzai Zen Senter and Karma Tashi Ling buddhistsamfunn) with the aim of creating an organization to deal with issues of common interest for all Norwegian Buddhists, and which could represent all the separate groups to the government. The main goal of Buddhistforbundet today is to foster communication and good relations between Buddhists of all traditions and groups, in order to promote Buddhist principles and practice in Norway.

[[File:Archives départementales de l'Oise cartulaire enchaîné de senlis 1.JPG|thumb|A cartulary]]
A '''cartulary''' or '''chartulary''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|tj|ʊ|l|ər|i}}; Latin: ''cartularium'' or ''chartularium''), also called ''pancarta'' or ''codex diplomaticus'', is a medieval manuscript volume or roll (''[[rotulus]]'') containing transcriptions of original documents relating to the foundation, privileges, and [[legal rights]] of ecclesiastical establishments, [[municipal corporations]], industrial associations, institutions of learning, or families. The term is sometimes also applied to collections of original documents bound in one volume or attached to one another so as to form a roll, as well as to custodians of such collections.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1971, "Chartulary".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Michael Clanchy]] defines a cartulary as "a collection of title deeds copied into a register for greater security".&lt;ref&gt;Clanchy, M.: "Cartularies", 1979, pp. 79–80; McCrank, "Discovery in the Archives of Spain and Portugal, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

A cartulary may take the form of a book or a ''[[codex]]''. Documents, chronicles or other kinds of handwritten texts were compiled, transcribed or copied into the cartulary.

In the introduction to the book ''Les Cartulaires'', it is argued that in the contemporary diplomatic world it was common to provide a strict definition as the organized, selective, or exhaustive transcription of diplomatic records, made by the owner of them or by the producer of the archive where the documents are preserved.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Cartulaires'', O. Guyotjeannin, L. Morelle, M. Parisse. Paris: ''École des chartes'', 1993; p. 7 of the ''Avant-propos''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Dictionary of Archival Terminology'' a cartulary is defined as "a register, usually in volume form, of copies of charters, title deeds, grants of privileges and other documents of significance belonging to a person, family or institution".&lt;ref&gt;Walne, P. (ed.): ''Dictionary of Archival Terminology''. Munich: K. G. Saur, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, the French historian, Emile Lesne, wrote: "Every Cartulary is the testimony of the statement of the Archives in a Church at the time when it was compiled".&lt;ref&gt;Geary, P.: "Entre ''gestion'' et ''gesta''", O. Guyotjeannin, L. Morelle, M. Parisse (eds.), ''Les Cartulaires''. Paris: École des chartes, 1993; pp. 13–24, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Related terms in other languages are: ''cartularium'' (Latin); ''Kopiar'', ''Kopialbuch'' ([[German language|German]]), ''Chartular'' (Oes.){{clarifyme|date=December 2015}}; ''cartolario, cartulario, cartario'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]); ''cartulario'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]).

In medieval [[Normandy]], a type of cartulary was common from the early 11th century that combined a record of gifts to the monastery with a short narrative. These works are known as ''[[pancartes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=van Houts, Elizabeth |title=Historical Writing |encyclopedia=A Companion to the Anglo-Norman World |editor=Harper-Bill, Christopher and Elizabeth van Houts |publisher=Boydell |location=Woodbridge, UK |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-84383-341-3 |pages=103–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and contents==
The allusion of [[Gregory of Tours]] to ''chartarum tomi'' in the 6th century is commonly taken to refer to cartularies. The oldest surviving cartularies, however, originated in the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://individual.utoronto.ca/emrecordkeeping/Pages/WorcesterCartulariesHome.html "J. Herold, 'The Earliest Records of Worcester Cathedral'"]: "Worcester Cathedral's pre-Conquest and Conquest-era archive is known to have included texts of over 200 acta ... in addition, there are transcripts of at least another 57 pre-conquest single-sheet acta now lost."&lt;/ref&gt; Those from the 10th to the 13th centuries are very numerous.

Cartularies frequently contain historical texts, known as cartulary chronicles, which may focus on the history of the monastery whose legal documents it accompanies, or may be a more general history of the world. This link between legal and historical writings has to be understood in the context of the importance of past events for establishing legal precedence.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Dunphy. "Cartulary chronicles and legal texts." Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle. Brill Online , 2012. Consulted 18 May 2012 [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-the-medieval-chronicle/cartulary-chronicles-and-legal-texts-SIM_01668]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Generally speaking, a cartulary attested by the signatures or marks of a number of prominent individuals ranks as a public document possessing greater value than a private letter or the narrative of an [[annalist]].
 
Sometimes the copyist of the cartulary reproduced the original documents with literal exactness. On the other hand, some copyists took liberties with the text, including modifying the phraseology, modernizing proper names of persons and places, and even changing the substance, so as to extend the scope of the privileges or immunities granted in the document. The value of a cartulary as a historical document depends not only on how faithfully it reproduces the substance of the original, but also, if edited, on the clues it contains to the motivation for those changes. These questions are generally the subject of scrutiny under well-known canons of [[historical criticism]].

==Publication and surveys==
Many cartularies of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] monasteries and churches have been published, more or less completely. A listing of all known medieval cartularies of the [[British Isles]], edited by Godfrey Davis, was published in 1958, and republished in a heavily revised and extended edition in 2010: the revised edition contains entries for about 2,000 cartularies, including those of both ecclesiastical establishments and secular corporations, dating from the 11th to 16th centuries, with details of dates, [[provenance]], current location, and (where appropriate) publication.&lt;ref&gt;Davis ''et al.'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Catalogue général des cartulaires des archives départementales'' (Paris, 1847) and the ''Inventaire des cartulaires'' etc. (Paris, 1878–9) were the chief sources of information regarding the cartularies of medieval France. There may be more recent developments in cataloguing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17475">'''Ceremonies of [[Ancient Greece]]''' encompasses those practices of a formal religious nature celebrating particular moments in the life of the community or individual in Greece from the period of the Greek dark ages (c. 1000 B.C) to the middle ages (c. 500 A.D). [[Ancient Greek religion]] was not standardised and had no formalised canon of religious texts, nor single priestly hierarchy, and practices varied greatly. However, ceremonial life in pre-Christian Greece generally involved offerings of a variety of forms towards gods and heroes, as well as a plethora of public celebrations such as weddings, burial rites, and festivals. 

== Offerings ==

=== Libation ===
[[File:Libation Macron Louvre G149.jpg|left|thumb|A man pours out a libation as depicted on an Attic terracotta cup]]
A [[libation]] is an offering involving the ritual pouring out of a liquid. In ancient Greece, such libations most commonly consisted of watered down wine, but also sometimes of pure wine, honey, olive oil, water or milk.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion in the Ancient Greek City|last=Zaidman &amp; Pantel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a basic aspect of religion in ancient Greece, and possibly the most common religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion in the Ancient Greek City|last=Zaidman &amp; Pantel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was common to perform libations at the beginning and end of every day, and also at the beginning of meals, and was customarily paired with prayer to the gods, which was performed while standing upright and sometimes with their arms raised up.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greek Religion|last=Burkert|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Libation commonly involved the pouring of wine from a handheld vessel. It was common to pour the substance from a wine jug into a bowl known as a phiale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Then, a part of the substance was poured from the phiale as an offering and the remainder is consumed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This ritual was repeated whenever wine was served. It was typical for libations from each bowl to be dedicated for a specific purpose. During a symposium, it was customary to serve three successive bowls of wine, where libations from the first bowl were usually dedicated either to the Olympians or to Agathos Daimon, libations from the second were usually dedicated to the heroes of Greek myth and libations from the third bowl were dedicated either to Zeus Teleios or to Hermes. Individuals could also make additional dedications to gods of their own choosing.    

It was common to also to perform libation as a part of animal sacrifices, where wine was poured onto the animal during the leadup to its sacrifice. Also, once the animal had been killed and burned, wine was poured onto the fire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;     

Libations were also poured into the dirt, as a ritual to honour both the humans and gods who reside in the underworld. The ''Odyssey'' explains one such offering, where a hole is dug by Odysseus in the earth, and water, honey and wine are spilled around it. Such libations could also be performed by tipping over a large vessel containing the substance to be offered. Libations would include blood in order to honour heroes who participated in war, while offerings at tombs would more commonly have involved milk or honey. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Greek Religion|last=Ogden|first=Daniel|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=88, 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

=== Animal Sacrifice ===

A key aspect of ceremonial life involved the [[Animal sacrifice|sacrificing of domestic animals]]. This was performed at an altar usually located outside of temples. Animal sacrifices were also accompanied with singing and with prayer. The animal was chosen, and should be of good stock and in good health, and bulls were preferred over other animals, though sacrifices could involve cows, sheep, goats, pigs and birds, however sheep were the most common animal that was sacrificed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://erenow.com/ancient/ancient-greece-and-rome-an-encyclopedia-for-students-4-volume-set/390.html|title=RITUAL AND SACRIFICE - Ancient Greece and Rome: An Encyclopedia for Students (4 Volume Set)|last=|first=|date=|website=erenow.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animal was adorned with garlands and led by a girl towards the altar. This girl concealed the sacrificial knife in a basket that she held over her head. Libations would also be poured over the animal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Various hymns were sung and prayers said as the animal was killed, and once the animal is slain, women were supposed to cry out loudly. The animal was butchered and its components were used for different purposes. The hide was usually bequeathed to the temple to sell, while the blood was poured over the altar.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The meat is prepared to be consumed by the celebrants while all the remaining inedible parts are gathered together and burned as an offering to the gods.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Libations might also be poured on the fire at this time. When honouring the gods of the underworld however, animal sacrifices were quite different, and the whole of the animal was burned as in a holocaust. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mycenaean World|last=Chadwick|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Animal sacrifices were practised at feasts in relation to the slaughtering of animals and the consumption of their meat. However, animal sacrifices were also used in order to win the favour of the gods, and so were used in times of disaster or before setting out upon some important mission, such as a military conflict. 

=== Pharmakos ===
[[Pharmakos]] refers to the ritualistic sacrifice of a human scapegoat. This practice was used especially during times of disaster in order to appease the gods and to purify the community. However, it was also practised on  a regular basis, such as on the first day of the [[Thargelia]] in Athens. Hipponax of Kolophon describes this process, where the two ugliest men that can be found were chosen to be sacrificed. Then, at the start of the Thargelia, the men were paraded around wearing fig-necklaces and beaten in the genitals using sticks from fig-trees. They were led to the seashore, where they were to be sacrificed, and killed by being stoned to death, then the corpses were burned and the ashes either cast into the sea or scattered onto the fields. Yet, there has been some contention about how reliable Hipponax's account was, especially given the time between when the ritual was performed and when Hipponax wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bremmer|first=J|date=1983|title=Scapegoat Rituals in Ancient Greece|url=|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=87|pages=299–320|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, this sacrificial ritual changed to a less severe form of atonement for a criminal act. So at sites like [[Lefkada]], criminals would sometimes be taken to be cast down from a cliff side, but he would be watched and caught underneath by men in boats, and his descent would be slowed by attaching birds or feathers to him. This reflected a distinctly non-lethal form of the scapegoat ritual which some scholars have used to support the idea that the pharmakos ceremony was never practised as an execution, and even in its earlier form, only involved stoning and severe beatings, but never to the point of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica|last=Chrisholm|first=Hugh|publisher=Cambrdige University|year=1911|isbn=|location=|pages=726–727}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Preparations for a wedding - ancient Greek ceramic painting.jpg|left|thumb|154x154px|Painting on ancient Greek ceramic depicting a bride preparing for her wedding.]]
== Weddings ==
There were smaller rituals that would be performed before the wedding itself, such as a bath of purification, offerings and sacrifices made at the temple and a prenuptial feast. Among the different city-states of Ancient Greece, it was most common to perform the wedding ceremony after dusk. And at that time, the bride would be escorted by her family on the back of a chariot as it moved slowly toward the groom's house.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://greece.mrdonn.org/weddings.html|title=Ancient Greek Weddings in Athens &amp; Sparta for Kids - Ancient Greece for Kids|website=greece.mrdonn.org|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of the bride leaving her father's house and joining her husband's was signified by the removal of the bride's veil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0129&amp;q1=Anacalyteria|title=History of Science: Cyclopædia: Alguazil - anagram|last=|first=|date=|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important ritual in the wedding ceremony was the offering up of an apple by the groom's family to be consumed by the bride.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The wedding ceremony was formalised by the bride moving in to her husband's house as well as by the bride's father giving a dowry to the groom. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Daily Life in Greece|last=Flaceliere|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Marriage ceremonies in Sparta differed greatly from the rest of the Greek city-states. Unlike in the rest of Greece, Spartan women had to consent for the marriage to be valid and not just her parents. The ceremony itself was also quite simple and short and would involve the bride and the groom engaging in hand-to-hand combat until the groom is able to overpower his bride and carry her back to his home. After the ceremony was complete, like in the other city-states, the families of the couple would celebrate over a feast.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Funeral Rites ==
[[File:Gela Painter - Black-Figure "Pinax" (Plaque) - Walters 48225.jpg|thumb|269x269px|A terracotta plaque depicting the dead body being displayed, surrounded by family with women tearing out their hair in mourning.]]
Prior to a person’s death, they would make arrangements for the care of their families and property, to say their final farewells and to pray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garland|first=Robert|date=|title=Death in Greek Literature|url=|journal=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome|volume=1|pages=371|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the person had died, the body was washed and anointed with oil and often a wreath would be put around the deceased person’s neck. Then, coins would be put on the person’s eyes, it was believed that this would allow the individual to pay [[Charon]], the ferryman of the dead, to transport them across the river Styx into the afterlife.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Death and Burial in the Ancient World|last=Toohey|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, an amulet would be put on the mouth instead, while in some mystery cults, they would use a golden ornament, sometimes known as a ‘passport of the dead,’ which carried important information for helping the deceased to find their way around in the underworld. 

The following day, the body was laid out for display. At this time, close female relatives of the deceased would lead the mourning by wailing loudly, hitting themselves and ripping their clothes and hair.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition|last=Alexiou|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early the following day, usually before sunrise, the body would be led in a procession to where it would be laid to rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Death and Burial in the Ancient World|last=Toohey|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; And at this point, mourners would cut off a piece of their hair and offer it alongside libations to the deceased.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Sometimes blood offerings were made also. Prayers were an important part of the burial process following the offerings. After the burial itself, the deceased person’s property would be cleansed with spiced saltwater, usually by their closest kinswomen and a feast would take place to honor all of the participants of the burial. And even after a person had been buried, it was important to continue to offer libations and cuttings of hair, as well as to regularly celebrate both recently deceased ancestors and the whole host of the dead at major ceremonies like the Genesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Death and Burial in the Ancient World|last=Toohey|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, funeral rites did vary both throughout the history of Ancient Greece as well as between the different city-states. For example, cremation was a common practice within the city-state of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Death and Burial in the Ancient World|last=Toohey|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mystery Cults ==
Mystery cults were a special aspect of religion in Ancient Greece, so named for the great level of secrecy associated with them. Unlike the rest of religious life in Ancient Greece, the rituals, practices and knowledge of mystery cults were only available to those people who had been initiated into them, known as ''Mystai'' and so to this day, not much is known about the mystery cults of Ancient Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Publishing|year=1995|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=|chapter=Mystery Religions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the major schools included the Eleusinian mysteries, the Dionysian mysteries and the Orphic mysteries.

=== Eleusinian Mysteries ===
Twice each year, initiates of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusinian mysteries]] travelled to Eleusis from Athens along the sacred way, once in the spring for the Lesser Mysteries and then again around September for the Greater Mysteries. During the journey, celebrants would re-enact Demeter's search for her daughter Kore.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/32/the-eleusinian-mysteries-the-rites-of-demeter/|title=The Eleusinian Mysteries: The Rites of Demeter|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the initiates stopped by a well, just as Demeter had, where they fasted and consumed a beverage made from mint and barley, which may have contained hallucinogenic properties.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After they had consumed the drink, the initiates would enter the underground theater, known as the Telesterion, where the Mysteries actually took place. This stage may have consisted of a ritual re-enactment of the story of Demeter and Kore, and Kore's death and transformation into the figure of Persephone, with which the whole of the Eleusinian Mysteries is concerned.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Many accounts and references to the Eleusinian mysteries describe them as having a profoundly powerful effect on the participants, and that many emerged from them without a fear of death.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Dionysian Mysteries ===
Less is known about the [[Dionysian Mysteries|Dionysian mysteries]] than the Eleusian mysteries, but it seems to share the same theme of seasonal death and rebirth.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.templeilluminatus.com/group/ancient-gods-and-goddesses/forum/topics/dionysian-mysteries|title=Dionysian Mysteries|website=www.templeilluminatus.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ceremonies within the Dionysian mystery involve the idea of losing control of one's body, of returning to a more primal world and abandoning civilized society.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Wine seems to have played a vital role to the Dionysian mysteries, but so did dancing and music, including the use of drums and bullroarers. A key aspect of the mysteries was the idea that by losing control of yourself in this way, the divine would come to inhabit your body.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The '''Communist Bund''' was a [[Jew]]ish [[political party]] in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. It was formed as the Russian [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] was split at its 12th conference in [[Gomel]] in April 1920. The Communist Bund was formed out of the leftwing majority section of the erstwhile Russian Bund (the rightwing minority formed the [[Social Democratic Bund]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brenner, Michael, and Derek Jonathan Penslar. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MnhJlFa0jd8C In Search of Jewish Community: Jewish Identities in Germany and Austria, 1918-1933]''.

The fourteen point of the resolution "On the Present Situation and the Tasks of Our Party" at the Gomel conference stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Summing up the experience of the last year, the Twelfth Conference of the Bund finds: 
# that the Bund, in principle, had adopted the communist platform since the Eleventh Conference, 
# that the Programme of the Communist Party, which is also the programme of the Soviet government, corresponds with the fundamental platform of the Bund, 
# that a ’united socialist front’ with principled opponents of Soviet power, who draw a line between the proletariat and its government, is impossible, 
# that the moment has come when the Bund can relinquish its official oppositional stand and take upon itself responsibility for the Soviet government’s policy.&lt;ref name="lenin1920"&gt;explanatory note to {{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/apr/18.htm|title=To Members of the Politbureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)|last= Lenin|first=Vladimir I.|date=between April 19 and May 6, 1920 |work=Marxists Internet Archive|publisher=Lenin Internet Archive (2003)|accessdate=2009-11-10}}, from documents archived at the Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.TJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The resolution on organisational questions at the Gomel conference stated that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The logical consequence of the political stand adopted by the Bund is the latter’s entry into the R.C.P on the same basis as the Bund’s membership of the R.S.D.L.P.. The conference authorised the C.C. of the Bund to see to it, as an essential condition, that the Bund preserve within the R.C.P. the status of an autonomous organisation of the Jewish proletariat.&lt;ref name="lenin1920"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On May 6, 1920, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolchevik) discussed the question of "The Conditions for the Bund’s Admission to Membership of the R.C.P." and resolved "that Kamenay, Stalin and Preobrazhensky be authorised to receive the representatives of the Bund and hear their proposals".&lt;ref name="lenin1920"/&gt;

On June 9, 1920, the communist faction of the ''[[United Jewish Socialist Workers Party|Fareynikhte]]'' party merged into the Communist Bund. It was also decided that the party would merge into the [[Russian Communist Party (bolshevik)]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinkus, Benjamin. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=52Ew77pZsNUC Jews of the Soviet Union: A History of a National Minority]''. [S.l.]: Cambridge, 1990. p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

At its 13th Conference in 1921 the Communist Bund decided to dissolve itself, and part of its membership joined the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) on the basis of the rules of admission.&lt;ref name="lenin1920"/&gt;

{{JewishMusic}}
For the purposes of this article, “contemporary” refers to the period from 1967 ([[Six-Day War|Israel’s Six-Day War]]) to the present day, “Jewish” refers to the various streams and traits of Judaism practiced.  Many Orthodox Jews use the term “religious” to refer to [[Torah Judaism|a strict adherence to Jewish law]]. For the purposes of this article, “religious” refers to the content and context of the music itself: liturgical or implicit references to the divine.

Jewish ethnomusicologist Mark Kligman notes, “The scope of contemporary Jewish music encompasses a wide range of genres and styles, including music for the synagogue, folk and popular music on religious themes, Yiddish songs, klezmer music, Israeli music, and art music by serious composers. Every sector of the Jewish community – from the most right-wing Orthodox to the most secular – participates in the Jewish music endeavor, creating, performing, and listening to the particular music that meets its taste and needs.”&lt;ref name="kligman"&gt;Kligman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of what is Jewish music and what makes music Jewish continues to be explored in academic and artistic circles alike. It may be seen in the work of [[Velvel Pasternak]], who has spent much of the late twentieth century as a preservationist committing what had been a strongly oral tradition to paper.  Also, [[John Zorn|John Zorn's]] record label, [[Tzadik Records|Tzadik]], features a "Radical Jewish Culture" series that focuses on exploring what contemporary Jewish music is and what it offers to contemporary [[Jewish culture]].

==History and influence==

===Hasidic influence===
Within the [[Orthodox judaism|traditional Jewish]] community, [[nigun|cantoral and chasiddic melodies]] were the musical standard.

In the 1950s and early 1960s recordings began to be made of noncantorial Jewish music, beginning with Benzion Shenker’s recording of the music of the [[Modzitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Modzitz]] chassidic sect &lt;ref name="kligman-96"&gt;Kligman, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cantor [[David Werdyger]]'s Gerrer recordings.  The annual Israeli Hasidic Song Festival, first held in 1969, became a stage which saw the premières of pieces like [[Nurit Hirsh|Nurit Hirsh’s]] ''Oseh Shalom;'' [[Svika Pick|Tzvika Pik’s]] ''Sh’ma Yisrael;'' and [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach’s]] ''Od Yishama'' and ''V’ha’eir Eineinu.''&lt;ref name="kligman"/&gt;

===Israeli influence===
With the founding of [[Israel|the State of Israel]] in 1948, American Jews showed increasing interest in Israeli music. This trend dramatically accelerated with the [[Six-Day War]]. “The practice of singing Israeli songs in American synagogues, camps, and at social gatherings, which spread in the 1950s, accelerated in the 1960s and 1970s as young American Jews looked to Israel as a positive model for Jewish identity, and the songs’ popularity also served as a Jewishly unifying factor.”&lt;ref name="kligman"/&gt;

An additional influence was in the pronunciation of Hebrew both in worship and song.  The Reform Movement, which previously had used [[Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation|Ashkenazic pronunciation]] of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] (reflecting a German-Polish tradition), switched to [[Sephardi Hebrew pronunciation|Sephardic pronunciation]] (reflecting the way Israelis spoke).&lt;ref name="schiller"/&gt;

===Folk music influence===
Largely influenced by the folk music revival of the time, in the 1960s and 1970s, a new genre of worship music grew out of the Reform summer camp movement.  From almost the beginning of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] worship, the music centered around the use of organ and choir.&lt;ref name="schiller"&gt;Schiller.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than the paradigm of organ and choir, the new music was composed for acoustic guitar and group singing.”&lt;ref name="dreyfus"&gt;Dreyfus.&lt;/ref&gt; This new style focused on making the music "simpler, thoroughly democratic in its singability, largely Hebrew, and playable on guitar."&lt;ref name="schiller"/&gt;

This influence is also clear in the music of Rabbi [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]].  Carlebach gained fame for bridging between the folk world and the traditional Jewish Hasidic tunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rock influence===
{{main|Jewish rock}}
At the same time as the folk revival made waves in Jewish worship, established composers like [[Gershon Kingsley]] and [[Ray Smolover]] utilized contemporary genres like jazz and rock in their compositions.&lt;ref name="schiller"/&gt; As in the broader world, the influence of rock music was debated and still is in some circles.  Influence of the rock world came to the Orthodox world with bands like the [[Diaspora Yeshiva Band]], founded in 1975 by American-born student-musicians at the [[Diaspora Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Besser, Yisroel. "We All Get Another Chance". ''[[Mishpacha]]'', March 12, 2014, pp. 48-58.&lt;/ref&gt; The founding members were Avraham Rosenblum on guitar, [[Ben Zion Solomon]] on fiddle and banjo, Simcha Abramson on saxophone and clarinet, Ruby Harris on violin, mandolin, guitar, and harmonica, [[Adam Wexler]] on bass, and Gedalia Goldstein on drums; other student-musicians also played with the group between 1973 and 1986.&lt;ref name="Diaspora"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishmag.com/114mag/band/band.htm|title=The Diaspora Yeshiva Band's impact on Jewish Music |last=Harris|first=Ruby|publisher=Jewish Magazine|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diaspora Yeshiva Band infused [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with Jewish lyrics, creating a style of music it called "Hasidic rock"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSO7AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=diaspora+yeshiva+band|title=Israel, a travel survival kit|first=Neil|last=Tilbury|year=1989|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|isbn= 0864420153|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Country and Eastern".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.diasporaband.com/biography/|title=Biography|publisher=Diaspora Yeshiva Band|year=2014|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://forward.com/articles/13320/a-jewish-pop-band-worth-the-wait-/|title=A Jewish Pop Band Worth the Wait|first=Alexander|last=Gelfand|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=8 November 2014|work=[[The Forward]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band was very popular on college campuses in the early to mid-1980s, and was famous in Jerusalem for its Saturday-night concerts at [[David's Tomb]]. It inspired later bands such as [[Blue Fringe]], Even Sh'siyah, [[Reva l'sheva]], [[Soulfarm]], the [[Moshav (band)|Moshav Band]], and [[Shlock Rock]].

Periodically Jewish music jumps into mainstream consciousness, with the [[reggae]] artist [[Matisyahu (musician)|Matisyahu]] being the most recent example. The 2007 Grammy Awards were a landmark in Jewish music, as the [[The Klezmatics|Klezmatics]] (a [[klezmer]]/[[folk music|folk group]]) became the first Jewish band to win a Grammy. Their music combines lyrics by [[Woody Guthrie]], the famous American lyricist, with classical klezmer tunes.

===Important figures===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
* [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]] is considered by many to be the most influential Jewish songwriter of the last half century.
* [[Michael Isaacson]] grew up in [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] summer camps and was the primary innovator in Jewish camp music. He has since established himself as a prominent composer of synagogue music.
* [[Tofa'ah]], founded in 1981, was the first all-women Jewish rock/jazz band. It sets traditional religious Jewish texts to its own compositions, as well as composes original Jewish inspirational songs. The band is unique in that it adheres strictly to the Jewish laws of [[kol isha]] and performs only for female audiences.  Its work is featured in the archives of [[Hebrew University]] and the [[Rubin Academy of Music and Dance]].
* [[Debbie Friedman]], another product of Reform Jewish summer camps, was the first woman to set religious Jewish texts in the [[American folk music revival|American folk genre]], rendering them easily accessible and popular across the denominations. Her settings of the prayers for the [[Havdalah]] ceremony and the "[[Yishtabach|Mi Shebeirach]]" prayer are ubiquitous in virtually every Jewish community. [[Julie Silver]] and Rabbi Shefa Gold have both followed in Debbie Friedman's footsteps as prolific female composers of contemporary Jewish religious music in their own right.
* Kol B'Seder, consisting of Cantor [[Jeff Klepper]] and Rabbi Daniel Freelander, also arose out of the Reform Jewish camp movement as one of the pioneering groups devoted to composing and fostering what is sometimes called “American [[Nusach]]: "the late 20th century refashioning of liberal Jewish worship to reflect the attitudes and beliefs of life in North America". Some of their well-known settings include "[[Modeh Ani]]", "Or Zarua",&lt;!-- [[Or Zarua]] is not correct target --&gt; and "[[Shalom Rav]]".
* [[Craig Taubman]] grew up in [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] camps and has also contributed a great deal of music to the genre, such as his settings of "[[L'cha Dodi]]" and "[[Hashkiveinu]]".
* [[Safam]], a six-man band founded in Boston in 1973, prides itself on a "Jewish-American Sound:" a wide breadth of American musical styles while maintaining a decidedly Jewish flavor. One of the group's founders, Robert Solomon, is a prominent cantor and composer in his own right.

==Modern trends==

===Trends in the Orthodox community===
In recent years, the time lag in style between the broad music world and its adoption by the Jewish music world had been decreasing.  Many groups and singers have released albums with noticeable influences from contemporary pop, rock music, etc. This is partly a result of a new wave of young Jewish musicians arriving out of [[yeshiva]]s and universities. Examples of this trend include The Chevra with clear pop-boy band overtones and dance moves and [[Blue Fringe]] with its extended jam sessions echoing [[Phish]] and the [[Dave Matthews Band]].  Other examples include acts such as [[Chaim-Dovid Saracik|Chaim Dovid]] or [[Shlomo Katz]] who echo Shlomo Carlebach's musical style.

One type of music that is very popular among Orthodox artists and their listeners usually consists of a formulaic mix including [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[French horn|horns]] and [[String instrument|strings]]. These songs are often a joint effort by a composer and an arranger with the singer having little to no input{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Many of the entertainers are former yeshiva students who perform in dress suits. Many have day jobs or are studying in [[kollel]] and sideline singing at [[Jewish wedding]]s. Musical background and training varies from no formal training to very high levels (though rarely academic).

Lyrics are most commonly short passages in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] from the [[Torah]] or the [[siddur]], with the occasional passage from the [[Talmud]]. Sometimes songs with original lyrics compiled in English, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] deal with central themes such as [[Jerusalem]], the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Judaism|Jewish identity]], and the [[Jewish diaspora]].

As a solution to the [[kol isha|Jewish law against men hearing women singing]], Jewish boys choirs became popular in the 1970s. Among the more notable of these groups are Pirchei London, the Toronto Boys Choir, the [[Miami Boys Choir]], and the Yeshiva Boys Choir. Currently the Miami Boys Choir led by Yerachmiel Begun is perhaps the most popular, with a number of albums amongst the top record sales in Orthodox Jewish circles. In addition, some female Orthodox musicians, including singers like [[Julia Blum]], [[Kineret (singer)|Kineret]], and [[Ruthi Navon]] and groups such as [[Tofa'ah]], [[Ashira (band)|Ashira]], and [[Bulletproof Stockings]], have found success performing for women only.&lt;ref name="Kligman-27"&gt;Kligman, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Roslyn Dickens|title=A Melody of Their Own: Orthodox Women and the Performing Arts|url=http://ou.org.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/ja/5767/fall67/38-43.pdf|website=[[Jewish Action]]|publisher=[[Orthodox Union]]|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Shepherd|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Volumes 3-7|date=2005|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5RUKAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=kineret+cohen+jewish+singer&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=kineret}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Matisyahu, some well-known Orthodox contemporary Jewish musicians include [[Yossi Green]], Martin Davidson, and [[Abie Rotenberg]]; well-known producers and arrangers  of this type of music are Yisroel Lamm, [[Ian Freitor]], [[Daniel Kapler]], [[Eli Leshinsky]].  Popular artists include [[Mordechai ben David|Mordechai Ben David]], [[Avraham Fried]], [[Lipa Schmeltzer]], [[Eli Gerstner]], [[Shloime Dachs]], [[Dedi Graucher]], and [[Yaakov Shwekey]].

===Trends in the Reform and Conservative communities===
The Reform Jewish summer camps continue to be a source of contemporary Jewish worship music, where artists like [[Craig Taubman]],&lt;ref&gt;Brown.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Nichols]],&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Observer, July 6, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rick Recht]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniels.&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Nelson,&lt;ref name="URJ"&gt;[[Union for Reform Judaism]], Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Goodis and others have shared their newest compositions with the latest generation of campers. Nichols and Recht are among the leading Jewish rock singers of the present day and remain extremely popular among Jewish summer campers.  [[Sam Glaser]], Sue Horowitz, Noam Katz, Beth Schafer, [[Julie Silver]], Peri Smilow and others have contributed significantly to modern Reform Jewish music and have been included in ''[[Ruach]]'', the biennial music compilation produced by the Union for Reform Judaism.&lt;ref name="URJ" /&gt;

===Children's music===
A large body of music produced by Orthodox Jews for children is geared toward teaching religious and ethical traditions and laws. The lyrics of these songs are generally written in English with some Hebrew or Yiddish phrases. [[Country Yossi]], [[Abie Rotenberg]], [[Uncle Moishy and the Mitzvah Men|Uncle Moishy]], and the producers of the [[613 Torah Avenue]] series are examples of Orthodox Jewish musicians/entertainers whose music teach children Jewish traditions.  Parallel performers exist in Israel with the lyric in Hebrew or Yiddish.

In the Reform and Conservative communities, there has been a body of contemporary children's music written in the last 20 years. Children's music tends to focus on teaching Jewish values and ethics, Hebrew alef-bet and vocabulary, and teaching about the holidays. Though well-known Jewish songwriters like Debbie Friedman and Craig Taubman have written many children's songs, there are some who focus almost exclusively on this genre, like [http://www.peterandellen.com Peter and Ellen Allard] and Shira Kline.

'''''De Otio''''' ('''''On Leisure''''') is a 1st-century [[Latin language|Latin]] work by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (4 BC–65 AD). It survives in a fragmentary state. The work concerns the rational use of spare time, whereby one can still actively aid humankind by engaging in wider questions about nature and the universe.

==Dating==
No absolute certainty about the date of writing is possible, but since the contents of the work parallel Seneca's own withdrawal into private life near the end of his life it is thought by a majority of critics to have been written around 62 AD or shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;G. D. Williams - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BwKvsrPvN_YC&amp;pg=PA2 Lucius Annaeus Seneca - De Otio - Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics (p.2)] (Cambridge University Press, 30 Jan 2003) {{ISBN|0521588065}} [Retrieved 2015-3-16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scotty"&gt;R Scott  Smith - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9jqOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147 Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist] (edited by Andreas Heil, Gregor Damschen) BRILL, 13 Dec 2013 {{ISBN|9004217088}} [Retrieved 2015-3-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title and contents==
''Otio'' is from ''[[otium]]'', this literally translates as leisure, vacant time, freedom from business.&lt;ref&gt;Perseus Digital Library - Latin Word Study Tool [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=otium&amp;la=la otium] - [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=otio&amp;la=la otio] [Retrieved 2015-3-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

''De Otio'' survives only in fragmentary form. The manuscript text begins mid-sentence, and ends rather abruptly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Howatson|first=M.|date=2013|title=The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature|page=519|isbn=0199548552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Shadi|editor-last=Bartsch|editor-first2=Alessandro|editor-last2=Schiesaro|title=The Cambridge Companion to Seneca|pages=79|isbn=1316239896}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Codex Ambrosianus]]'' (the main source for Seneca's essays) it is simply tacked onto the end of ''[[De Vita Beata]]'' suggesting a scribe missed a page or two.&lt;ref name="coopro"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seneca: Moral and Political Essays|author1-first=John M.|author1-last=Cooper|author2-first=J. F.|author2-last=Procopé|year=1995|page=167|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521348188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the essay, ''De Otio'', is known from the table of contents. The addressee has been erased but appears to have been seven letters long and is assumed to have been Seneca's friend [[Annaeus Serenus|Serenus]].&lt;ref name="coopro"/&gt; ''De Otio'' is thus one of a trio of dialogues addressed to Serenus, which also includes ''[[De Constantia Sapientis]]'' and ''[[De Tranquillitate Animi]]''.&lt;ref name="G Biagio Conte "/&gt; Chronologically, it is thought to be the last of the three.&lt;ref name="G Biagio Conte "/&gt;

==Themes==
Seneca understood the  word ''otio'' to represent something more than absolute free-time. He understood it to mean leisure used in service to the community by intellectual activity:&lt;ref&gt;T E Beck (editor) "Introduction" to [[Bartolomeo Taegio|B Taegio]] - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ATzugN-nHwEC&amp;pg=PA42 La Villa (first published 1559)] ''Penn Studies in Landscape Architecture'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 21 Sep 2011) {{ISBN|0812203801}} [Retrieved 2015-3-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... {{lang|la|hoc nempe ab homine exigitur, ut prosit hominibus}}

... this of course is required of a human, to benefit their fellow humans
}}

In ''De Otio'' Seneca debates the appropriate life for a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher. Seneca reports the standard position of the school that wise people will engage in public affairs, unless something prevents them. Seneca lists some arguments against engaging in public life such as if the state is too corrupt, or if the wise person's influence is too limited, or if they are ill. Seneca then shows that private life (''otium'') far from being a life of listless retirement can be active from a Stoic point of view. The wise person can choose to engage with the wider universe: by moving one's actions from the local to the cosmic perspective and engage with the fundamental questions of the universe, one can still aid all of humankind.&lt;ref name="scotty"/&gt;

The superior position [[Sage (philosophy)|the sage]] (''ho sophos'') inhabits of detachment from earthly (''terena'') concerns, and an according freedom from possibile future events of detrimental nature, is a unifying theme of the dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;R Bett - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lK_cXAXtyXoC&amp;pg=PA531 A Companion to Ancient Philosophy - p.531] (edited by Mary Louise Gill, Pierre Pellegrin)[Retrieved 2015-3-19] (ed. Bett was source of term ''ho sophos'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G Biagio Conte "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NJGp_dkXnuUC&amp;pg=PA411|author=Gian Biagio Conte -  professor of Latin literature in the Department of Classical Philology at the University of Pisa, Italy.

The '''Taishang dongyuan shenzhou jing''' ({{zh|s=太上洞渊神咒经|t=太上洞淵神咒經|p=Tàishàng dòngyuān shénzhòu jīng|w=''T'ai-shang shen-chou ching''|l=Most High Cavernous Abyss Divine Spells Scripture}}), or '''The Divine Incantations Scripture''', is the oldest known [[Chinese classic text]] that details an [[apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;DeBary &amp; Bloom, ''Sources of Chinese Tradition'', v.1, (1999), p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest portions of the book have been traced back to the beginning of the fifth century CE, with subsequent commentary attesting an origin in the early fourth; the book likely integrates older traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seiwert|first=Hubert Michael|title=Popular Religious Movements and Heterodox Sects in Chinese History|year=2003|page=84|isbn=978-9004131460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They offered a new route to [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] that was different from the [[Heavenly masters]] movement from which it branched.  The Divine Incantations Scripture sought to clarify the gods are, "in a word, merely the officials of the [[celestial bureaucracy]]."&lt;ref&gt;DeBary &amp; Bloom (1999), p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; The text was unique for the time in that it promised the aid of celestial "ghost troops" to those who upheld its teachings and acknowledged the dynamic obedience and simultaneous danger of various "daemon kings" that also existed in a fantastical version of the [[metaphysics|metaphysical world]].  These characteristics draw interesting parallels with the cosmic and celestial warfare depicted in the [[Book of Revelation]] from the Christian [[New Testament]] canon.  The book also urges Daoists to "assiduously convert the unenlightened," and demands scriptural exclusivity when receiving the Divine Incantations Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;DeBary &amp; Bloom, (1999), p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilgit''' ([[Shina language|Shina]]: {{Nastaliq|گلیت}}, [[Urdu]]: {{Nastaliq|گلگت}}), known locally as '''Gileet''', is the [[capital city]] of the [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] region, an administrative territory of [[Pakistan]]. The city is located in a broad valley near the [[confluence]] of the [[Gilgit River]] and [[Hunza River]]. Gilgit is a major tourist destination in northern Pakistan, and serves as a hub for mountaineering expeditions in the [[Karakoram Range]]. It was an important stop on the ancient [[Silk Road]], and today serves as a major junction along the [[Karakoram Highway]] with road connections to [[China]], [[Skardu]], [[Chitral]], [[Peshawar]], and [[Islamabad]].

==Etymology==
The city's ancient name was ''Sargin'', later to be known as ''Gilit'', and it is still referred to as ''Gilit'' or ''Sargin-Gilit'' by local people. In the [[Burushaski language]], it is named ''Geelt'' and in [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]] and [[Khowar language|Khowar]] it is called ''Gilt''.

==History==
===Early history===
[[Brokpa|Brogpas]] trace their settlement from Gilgit into the fertile villages of Ladakh through a rich corpus of hymns, songs, and folklore that have been passed down through generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Counterinsurgency, Democracy and the Politics of Identity in Pakistan]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dard people|Dards]] and Shinas appear in many of the old [[Puranas|Pauranic]] lists of people who lived in the region, with the former also mentioned in [[Ptolemy]]'s accounts&lt;ref&gt;[[Counterinsurgency, Democracy and the Politics of Identity in India]]&lt;/ref&gt; of the region.

===Buddhist era===
[[File:Kargah Buddha Gilgit Baltistan.jpg|thumb|The [[Kargah Buddha]] outside of Gilgit dates from around 700 [[Common era|C.E.]].]]
[[File:Henzal Stupa Gilgit.jpg|thumb|The ''Hanzal'' stupa dates from the Buddhist era.]]
Gilgit was an important city on the [[Silk Road]], along which [[Buddhism]] was spread from South Asia to the rest of [[Asia]]. It is considered as a Buddhism corridor from which many Chinese monks came to Kashmir to learn and preach [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=Drew /&gt; Two famous Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, [[Faxian]] and [[Xuanzang]], traversed Gilgit according to their accounts.

According to Chinese records, between the 600s and the 700s, the city was governed by a Buddhist dynasty referred to as ''Little Balur'' or ''Lesser Bolü'' ({{zh|c=小勃律}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In mid-600s, Gilgit came under Chinese suzerainty after the fall of [[Western Turkic Khaganate]] due to [[Tang campaigns against the Western Turks|Tang military campaigns in the region]]. In late 600s CE, the rising [[Tibetan Empire]] wrestled control of the region from the Chinese. However, faced with growing influence of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and then the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] to the west, the Tibetans were forced to ally themselves with the Islamic caliphates. The region was then contested by Chinese and Tibetan forces, and their respective vassal states, until the mid-700s. Chinese record of the region last until late-700s at which time the Tang's western military campaign was weakened due to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The control of the region was left to the Tibetan Empire. They referred to the region as Bruzha, a toponym that is consistent with the ethnonym "[[Burusho people|Burusho]]" used today. Tibetan control of the region lasted until late-800s CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

This corpus of manuscripts was discovered in 1931 in Gilgit, containing many Buddhist texts such as four [[sutra]]s from the Buddhist canon, including the famous [[Lotus Sutra]]. The manuscripts were written on [[birch bark]] in the Buddhist form of [[Sanskrit]] in the [[Sharada script]]. They cover a wide range of themes such as [[icon]]ometry, [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[philosophy]], [[medicine]] and several related areas of life and general knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-17935041 |title=BBC News – India: Rare Buddhist manuscript Lotus Sutra released |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=3 May 2012 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Trakhàn===
{{cquote|The former rulers had the title of ''Ra'', and there is a reason to suppose that they were at one time [[Hindu]]s, but for the last five centuries and a half they have been [[Moslems]]. The names of the [[Hindu]] Ras have been lost, with the exception of the last of their number, [[Shri]] Ba'dut. Tradition relates that he was killed by a Mohammedan adventurer, who married his daughter and founded a new dynasty, since called [[Trakhàn Dynasty|Trakhàn]], from a celebrated Ra named Trakhan, who reigned about the commencement of the fourteenth century. The previous rulers—of whom Shri Ba'dut was the last—were called [[Shahreis]].&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;}}

===Trakhàn Dynasty===
[[File:A Dance at Gilgit.jpg|thumb|A Dance at Gilgit by [[G. W. Leitner]], 1893|left|331x331px]]

Gilgit was ruled for centuries by the local [[Trakhàn Dynasty]], which ended about 1810 with the death of Raja Abas, the last Trakhàn Raja.&lt;ref name="Drew"&gt;[[Frederick Drew]] (1875) ''The Jummoo and Kashmir Territories: A Geographical Account'' E. Stanford, London, [http://worldcat.org/oclc/1581591 OCLC 1581591]&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] and [[Nagar Valley|Nager]] also claim origin with the Trakhàn dynasty. They claim descent from a heroic [[Kayanian dynasty|Kayani]] Prince of Persia, ''[[Azur Jamshid]]'' (also known as ''Shamsher''), who secretly married the daughter of the king ''Shri Badat''.

She conspired with him to overthrow her [[cannibal]] father. Sri Badat's faith is theorised as Hindu by some&lt;ref&gt;Amar Singh Chohan (1984) ''The Gilgit Agency, 1877–1935'', Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Charles (1976) ''Between the Oxus and the Indus'', Francis Schomberg, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; and Buddhist by others.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Osmaston, Philip Denwood (1995) ''Recent Research on Ladakh 4 &amp; 5: Proceedings of the Fourth and Fifth'', Motilal Banarsidass, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Hasan Dani (1989) ''History of Northern Areas of Pakistan'', Islamabad : National Institute of Historical and Cultural Research, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; However, considering the region's Buddhist heritage, with the most recent influence being [[Islam]], the most likely preceding influence of the region is Buddhism.

Prince Azur Jamshid succeeded in overthrowing King Badat who was known as the ''Adam Khor'' (literally "man-eater"),&lt;ref&gt;''Imperial Gazetteer of India. Provincial Series: Kashmir and Jammu'', {{ISBN|0-543-91776-2}}, Adamant, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Charles (1976) ''Between the Oxus and the Indus'', Francis Schomberg, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; often demanding a child a day from his subjects, his demise is still celebrated to this very day by locals in traditional annual celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/jneelis/dissertation/Chapter1.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the new year, where a Juniper procession walks along the river, in memory of chasing the cannibal king ''Sri Badat'' away.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Osmaston, Philip Denwood (1995) ''Recent Research on Ladakh 4 &amp; 5'', Motilal Banarsidass Publ., p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Azur Jamshid abdicated after 16 years of rule in favour of his wife ''Nur Bakht Khatùn'' until their son and heir ''Garg'', grew of age and assumed the title of [[Raja]] and ruled, for 55 years. The dynasty flourished under the name of the Kayani dynasty until 1421 when Raja Torra Khan assumed rulership. He ruled as a memorable king until 1475. He distinguished his family line from his stepbrother ''Shah Rais Khan'' (who fled to the king of Badakshan, and with whose help he gained Chitral from ''Raja Torra Khan''), as the now-known dynastic name of Trakhàn. The descendants of ''Shah Rais Khan'' were known as the ''Ra'issiya Dynasty''.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Hasan Dani (1999) ''History of Civilizations of Central Asia'', Motilal Banarsidass Publ, pp. 216–217&lt;/ref&gt;

===1800s===
{{cquote|The period of greatest prosperity was probably under the [[yashkun of Hindukush|Shin]] Ras, whose rule seems to have been peaceable and settled. The whole population, from the Ra to the poorest subject lived by agriculture. According to tradition, [[Shri]] Buddutt's rule extended over [[Chitral]], [[Yasin Valley|Yassin]], [[Tangir]], [[Darel]], [[Chilas]], [[Gor, Gilgit|Gor]], [[Astore Valley|Astor]], [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]], [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] and [[Haramosh]] all of which were held by tributary princes of the same family.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;John Bidduph (2004) ''Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh'',  Adamant Media Corporation, {{ISBN|1402152728}}, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Then, Azad Khan the cheater, Raja of [[Punial]], killed Sulaiman Shah, taking Gilgit; then Tahir Shah, Raja of Buroshall ([[Nagar Valley|Nagar]]), took Gilgit and killed Azad Khan.

Tair Shah's son Shah Sakandar inherited, only to be killed by Gohar Aman, Raja of Yasin of the Khushwakhte Dynasty when he took Gilgit. Then in 1842, Shah Sakandar's brother, Karim Khan, expelled Yasin rulers with the support of a [[Sikh Confederacy|Sikh]] army from Kashmir. The Sikh general, Nathu Shah, left garrison troops and Karim Khan ruled until Gilgit was ceded to [[Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir]] in 1846 by the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]],&lt;ref name="Drew"/&gt; and [[Dogra]] troops replaced the [[Sikh]] in Gilgit.

Nathu Shah and Karim Khan both transferred their allegiance to Gulab Singh, continuing local administration. When [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] attacked in 1848, both of them were killed. Gilgit fell to the Hunza and their Yasin and Punial allies but was soon reconquered by Gulab Singh's Dogra troops. With the support of Raja Gohar Aman, Gilgit's inhabitants drove their new rulers out in an uprising in 1852. Raja Gohar Aman then ruled Gilgit until his death in 1860, just before new Dogra forces from [[Ranbir Singh (Maharaja)|Ranbir Singh]], son of Gulab Singh, captured the fort and town.&lt;ref name=" Drew"/&gt;

In the 1870s Chitral was threatened by Afghans, Maharaja Ranbir Singh was firm in protecting Chitral from Afghans, the Mehtar of Chitral asked for help. In 1876 Chitral accepted the authority of Jammu Clan and in reverse get the protection from the Dogras who have in the past took part in many victories over Afghans during the time of Gulab Singh Dogra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Prakash Nanda|title=Rising India: Friends and Foes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_U55rXIijnsC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2007|publisher=Lancer Publishers|isbn=978-0-9796174-1-6|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Raj===
{{Main|Gilgit Agency}}
In 1877, in order to guard against the advance of Russia, the British India Government, acting as the [[suzerain]] power of the princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]], established the [[Gilgit Agency]]. The Agency was re-established under control of the British Resident in Jammu and Kashmir. It comprised the Gilgit [[Wazarat]]; the State of Hunza and Nagar; the Punial Jagir; the Governorships of Yasin, [[Kuh-Ghizr]] and [[Ishkoman]], and Chilas.

The [[Tajiks of Xinjiang]] sometimes enslaved the Gilgiti and Kunjuti Hunza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA56|title=Report of a mission to Yarkund in 1873, under command of Sir T.

[[File:100 years of the RAF MOD 45163719.jpg|thumb|British [[Westland Wapiti]]s based in Gilgit around 1930]]
In 1935, the British India government demanded from the Jammu and Kashmir state to lease them Gilgit town plus most of the Gilgit Agency and the hill-states Hunza, Nagar, Yasin and Ishkoman for 60 years.{{sfn|Bangash, Three Forgotten Accessions|2010|p=122}} The leased region was then treated as part of [[British India]], administered by a Political Agent at Gilgit responsible to Delhi, first through the Resident in Jammu and Kashmir and later a British Agent in [[Peshawar]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Jammu and Kashmir State no longer kept troops in Gilgit and a mercenary force, the [[Gilgit Scouts]], was recruited with British officers and paid for by Delhi.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} In April 1947, Delhi decided to formally retrocede the leased areas to Hari Singh’s Jammu and Kashmir State as of 15 August 1947. The transfer was to formally take place on 1 August. However, the Gilgit Scouts rebelled against this action, and under the guidance of Major WA 'Willie' Brown, ceded to the newly founded state of [[Pakistan]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[Abdullah Sahib]] was an [[Arain]] and belonged to Chimkor Sahib village of [[Ambala]] district [[Punjab, British India]]. Abdullah Sahib was the first Muslim governor of the Gilgit in [[British India|British]] time period and was close associate of Maharaja Partap Singh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdullah Sahib]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan Bahadur Kalay Khan, a Mohammed Zai Pathan, was the Governor of Gilgit Hunza and Kashmir before partition.

===1947 Kashmir war===
On 26 October 1947, [[Maharaja Hari Singh]] of Jammu and Kashmir, faced with a tribal invasion by Pakistan, signed the [[Instrument of Accession]], joining India.

Gilgit's population did not favour the State's accession to India.{{sfn|Bangash|2010|p=128|ps=: [Ghansara Singh] wrote to the prime minister of Kashmir: 'in case the State accedes to the Indian Union, the Gilgit province will go to Pakistan', but no action was taken on it, and in fact Srinagar never replied to any of his messages.}} The Muslims of the Frontier Districts Province (modern day Gilgit-Baltistan) had wanted to join [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0cPjAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14&amp;dq=muslims+in+jammu+province+and+frontier+province+wanted+to+join+pakistan+snedden&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdh8XLtZPRAhVGwLwKHc-kCngQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=muslims%20in%20jammu%20province%20and%20frontier%20province%20wanted%20to%20join%20pakistan%20snedden&amp;f=false|title=Kashmir-The Untold Story|last=Snedden|first=Christopher|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers India|year=2013|isbn=9789350298985|location=|pages=|quote=Similarly, Muslims in Western Jammu Province, particularly in Poonch, many of whom had martial capabilities, and Muslims in the Frontier Districts Province strongly wanted J&amp;K to join Pakistan.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensing their discontent, Major William Brown, the Maharaja's commander of the [[Gilgit Scouts]], mutinied on 1 November 1947, overthrowing the Governor Ghansara Singh. The bloodless ''coup d'etat'' was planned by Brown to the last detail under the code name "Datta Khel", which was also joined by a rebellious section of the Jammu and Kashmir 6th Infantry under [[Col Mirza Hassan Khan|Mirza Hassan Khan]]. Brown ensured that the treasury was secured and minorities were protected. A provisional government (''Aburi Hakoomat'') was established by the Gilgit locals with Raja Shah Rais Khan as the president and Mirza Hassan Khan as the commander-in-chief. However, Major Brown had already telegraphed [[Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan]] asking Pakistan to take over. The Pakistani political agent, Khan Mohammad Alam Khan, arrived on 16 November and took over the administration of Gilgit.{{sfn|Schofield|2003|pp=63–64}}&lt;ref name=accessions&gt;{{harvnb|Bangash|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown outmaneuvered the pro-Independence group and secured the approval of the mirs and rajas for accession to Pakistan.

The provisional government lasted 16 days. The provisional government lacked sway over the population. The Gilgit rebellion did not have civilian involvement and was solely the work of military leaders, not all of whom had been in favor of joining Pakistan, at least in the short term. Historian [[Ahmed Hasan Dani]] mentions that although there was lack of public participation in the rebellion, pro-Pakistan sentiments were intense in the civilian population and their anti-Kashmiri sentiments were also clear.&lt;ref&gt;Yaqoob Khan Bangash (2010) Three Forgotten Accessions: Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History, 38:1, 132, DOI: 10.1080/03086530903538269&lt;/ref&gt; According to various scholars, the people of Gilgit as well as those of Chilas, Koh Ghizr, Ishkoman, Yasin, Punial, Hunza and Nagar joined Pakistan by choice.&lt;ref&gt;Yaqoob Khan Bangash (2010) Three Forgotten Accessions: Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History, 38:1, 137, DOI: 10.1080/03086530903538269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1024253/gilgit-baltistan-part-of-pakistan-by-choice/|title=Gilgit-Baltistan—part of Pakistan by choice|last=Bangash|first=Yaqoob Khan|date=9 January 2016|work=The Express Tribune|quote=Nearly 70 years ago, the people of the Gilgit Wazarat revolted and joined Pakistan of their own free will, as did those belonging to the territories of Chilas, Koh Ghizr, Ishkoman, Yasin and Punial; the princely states of Hunza and Nagar also acceded to Pakistan.

==Geography==
[[File:Mount hunza.jpg|thumb|Gilgit is situated amongst some of the world's most dramatic mountain scenery]]
Gilgit is situated in a valley formed by the confluence of the [[Indus River]], [[Hunza River]] and [[Gilgit River]].

===Climate===
Gilgit experiences a [[desert climate|cold desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWk''). Weather conditions for Gilgit are dominated by its geographical location, a valley in a mountainous area, southwest of [[Karakoram]] range. The prevalent season of Gilgit is winter, occupying the valley eight to nine months a year.

Gilgit lacks significant rainfall, averaging in {{convert|120|to|240|mm}} annually, as [[monsoon]] breaks against the southern range of [[Himalayas]]. Irrigation for land cultivation is obtained from the rivers, abundant with melting snow water from higher altitudes.

The summer season is brief and hot. Strong sunshine occasionally raises temperaturs to {{convert|40|C}}, though it typically is cooler in the shade. As a result of this extremity in the weather, landslides and avalanches are frequent in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Long-term plans for the [[China–Pakistan Economic Corridor]] call for construction of the 682 kilometre long [[Khunjerab Railway]], which is expected to be completed in 2030,&lt;ref name="Post Today"&gt;{{cite news|title=Havelian to Khunjerab railway track to be upgraded under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor|url=http://sosttoday.com/5285-2/|accessdate=10 February 2016|publisher=Sost Today|date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would also serve Gilgit.

{{Chinese salvationism}}
'''Guiyidao''' (皈依道, "Way of the Return to the One"), better known as '''Precosmic Salvationism''' (先天救教 ''Xiāntiān jiùjiào''; or "Former Heaven Salvationism") in contemporary [[Taiwan]], and historically also known by the name of its institutions as '''Daodeshe''' (道德社), '''Guiyi Daoyuan''' (皈依道院) or later '''Daoyuan''' (道院) — respectively "Community of the Way and its Virtue", "School of the Way of the Return to the One" or simply "School of the Way" — is a Chinese [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious movement of salvation]] belonging to the [[Xiantiandao]] ("Way of Former Heaven") tradition.

Similarly to other Xiantiandao sects, Guiyidao is focused on the worship of the universal [[God]] ([[Tian]]), which it defines as the Holiest Venerable Patriarch of the Primordial Heaven (''Zhisheng Xiantian Laozu''), as the source of [[salvation]].

Guiyidao is related to the Japanese [[Shinto sect]] of [[Oomoto|Omoto]] (大本 "Great Source"){{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=101}} and is a proscribed religion in the People's Republic of [[China]], thereafter being active as an underground church.{{sfnb|Munro|1994|p=270}} The charitable branch of Daoyuan is known as the Red Swastika Society (世界红卍字会 ''Hóngwànzìhuì'').{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=101}}

==History==
Guiyidao was founded in 1916 in the Pin County of [[Shandong]] as a ''[[fuji (planchette writing)|fuji]]'' group.{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=100}} It was led by Liu Shoji (劉紹基). The following year the association moved to the provincial capital [[Jinan]] where it interacted with the [[Tongshanshe]], another Xiantiandao sect.{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=100}} Adopting the organisation structure and meditation techniques of the Tongshanshe, the Guiyi Daoyuan was created in 1921.{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=101}}

The association formally established itself in [[Beijing]] with the support of premier [[Xiong Xiling]] (1870-1937, premier in 1913-14) and the American Christian missionary Gilbert Reid,{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=101}} and between 1922 and 1928 it expanded throughout China.{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=101}} The Daoyuan also set up a nationwide charity organisation, the Red Swastika Society (世界红卍字会 ''Hóngwànzìhuì''), which was China's largest relief organisation during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]].{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=101}}

The Daoyuan had a separate organisational structure managed by and for women, which oversaw their religious activity, education and child care, both affirming traditional virtues and valorising women's public service.{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=101}} Western missionaries were fascinated by Daoyuan, which drew members among the Christians, given its inclusion and interpretation of [[Jesus]]' teaching.{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=101}}

Reports of Guiyidao-Red Swastika strength during the 1920s and 1930s seem to vary widely, with citations of 30,000 "members" in 1927 to 7–10 million "followers" in 1937.&lt;ref name="Duara"&gt;Duara, Prasenjit. ''Of Authenticity and Woman: Personal Narratives of Middle-Class Women in Modern China''. Becoming Chinese. Wen-Hsin Yeh, ed. Berkeley: University of California Press. 2000. p 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese developments===
After an earthquake in Japan in 1923, a Guiyidao relief mission was sent there, leading to the creation of a Japanese branch of the sect and ties with [[Shinto sects]] given the strong resonance of their beliefs.{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=101}} The first president of Japanese Daoyuan was Deguchi Onisaburo (1871-1948), the cofounder of the [[Oomoto|Omoto]] (大本 "Great Source") Shinto sect.{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=101}}

Other members included Ueshiba Morihei (1883-1969), founder of the [[Aikido]] style of martial arts; Okada Mokichi (1882-1955), who in 1955 founded the [[Church of World Messianity]]; Nakano Yonosuke (1887-1974), founder in 1949 of the Ananai sect of Omoto; and Goi Masahisa, founder of the White Light sect.{{sfnb|Goossaert|2011|p=101-102}}

===After 1949===
Suppressed by the communist regime after 1949, Guiyidao has persisted as an underground religion in the People's Republic of [[China]].{{sfnb|Munro|1994|p=270}} Branches of the sect are present in [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States of America]]. Since 1950, the [[Hong Kong]] Daoyuan has served as the world headquarters of Guiyidao outside of mainland China.

==The Red Swastika Society==
[[File:Red Swastika Society member.jpg|thumb|150px|A member of the Red Swastika, circa 1937.]]
The [[Red Swastika Society]] is the philanthropic branch of Guiyi Daoyuan founded in 1922 by Qian Nengxun (錢能訓), Du Bingyin (杜秉寅) and Li Jiabai (李佳白). The establishment of the federation was set up in [[Beijing]] together with the organization's president Li JianChiu (李建秋) drawing on Western examples such as the [[Red Cross]] to build charitable institutions grounded in Chinese religion. The [[swastika]] (卍 ''wàn''; "infinity", "all") in Chinese and other cultures is a symbol of the manifestation of God or its creation. 

Red Swastika's mission was a broad based effort of philanthropy and moral education. It ran [[poorhouses]] and [[soup kitchen]]s, as well as modern hospitals and other relief works. It had an explicit international focus, extending relief efforts to [[Tokyo]] after earthquakes and also in response to natural disasters in the [[Soviet Union]]. In addition, it had offices in [[Paris]], [[London]], and [[Tokyo]] and professors of [[Esperanto]] within its membership.&lt;ref&gt;Duara, Prasenjit. ''Transnationalism in the Era of Nation-States: China 1900-1945''. Globalization and Identity. [[Birgit Meyer]] and Peter Geschiere, eds. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. 2003. p 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best reported event of its history was its role in the [[Nanking Massacre]]. The rampage of the occupying [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]] through the city left thousands of bodies in the streets, and the Red Swastika stepped in to assist in burials. Records of these activities from the Red Swastika have provided important primary resources for research into the scale of the atrocity and the location of mass graves.

Although it was suppressed during the [[Maoist]] rule in [[mainland China]], the Red Swastika continues today as a religious organization focused on charity. It has branches in areas of the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese diaspora]], with headquarters in [[Taiwan]]. Besides charity work, the Red Swastika runs two schools in [[Hong Kong]] ([[Tuen Mun]] and [[Tai Po]]) and one in Singapore ([[Red Swastika School]]).

[[Image:Södrakvinnebysign.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Södra Kvinneby]]
The '''Kvinneby amulet''' ([[Rundata|Öl SAS1989;43]]) is an 11th-century [[runic alphabet|runic]] [[amulet]] found in the mid-1950s buried in the village of Södra Kvinneby in [[Öland]], Sweden. The amulet is a square copper object measuring approximately 5&amp;nbsp;cm on each side. Near one edge there is a small hole, presumably used for hanging it around the neck.

==Inscription==
The inscription consists of some 143 runes, written ''[[boustrophedon]]'', supplemented by an engraving of a fish; the relevance of the fish to the text is unclear.

The inscription is one of the longest and best preserved for its time but it has proven hard to interpret. The "official" [[Rundata]] interpretation is:
{{bq|text=Here I carve(d) protection for you, Bófi, with/... ... ... to you is certain. And may the lightning hold all evil away from Bófi. May Þórr protect him with that hammer which came from out of the sea. Flee from evilness! You/it get/gets nothing from Bófi. The gods are under him and over him.}}

==Deciphering attempts==
[[File:Kvinnebyamuletten 225526.jpg|thumb|Kvinneby amulet, side with a fish.]]
There have been five other serious attempts to decipher the text. This article treats each in turn.

===Bruce E. Nilsson 1976===
Bruce E. Nilsson was the first to offer an interpretation of the amulet. Ignoring what seem to be [[bind rune]]s at the start of the inscription, he offered this transliteration:

:'''ti&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;þi&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;birk'''
:'''bufimi&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;fultihu'''
:'''risþe&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;uisinbral'''
:'''tilufranbufaþorketih'''
:'''ansmi&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;þemhamrisamhu&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;'''
:'''hafikamflufraniluit'''
:'''fe&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;ekiafbufakuþi&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;u'''
:'''unti&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;hanumaukyfi&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;han'''
:'''um'''

and the following translation into English:

{{bq|text=Glory to thee bear I, Bove. Help me! Who is wiser than thee? And bear all in (the form of) evil from Bove. May [[Thor]] protect him with that hammer which came from the sea, (and which) fled from evil. Wit fares not from Bove. The gods are under him and over him.}}

Nilsson interprets: "[T]he amulet is an invocation to the gods to protect Bove, especially while he is at sea." This he bases on the carving of the fish, the mention of the sea in the text and the place where the amulet was found.

Nilsson understands the mention of Thor and his hammer as a reference of the story of Thor's fishing; where he threw his hammer at the head of [[Jörmungandr]], the Midgard serpent. Since Thor's hammer always returns to its thrower it might in this case be said that it 'fled from evil' and 'came from the sea'.

Nilsson does not attempt to solve the first few runic symbols of the inscription. He ventures a guess that they might conceal the name or cognomen of a god. The fish looks more promising to Nilsson. He suggests that it might contain coded runes. The fins of the fish can, according to him, be represented graphically as:

&lt;pre&gt;
|| | ||
|| || |
&lt;/pre&gt;

This might represent the runes 'nbh' in some order. Nilsson suggests that the meaning is based on the names of the runes; thus the amulet should give a [[berkanan|björg]] from [[haglaz|hagl]] and [[naudiz|nauð]] or a "deliverance" from "hail" and "need". He adds that this is "not at all certain".

Unfortunately Nilsson's interpretation is not treated critically by later authors.

===Ivar Lindquist 1987 (a posthumous publication)===
Ivar Lindquist took some 30 years to ponder the amulet - and it shows. He offers a plethora of interpretations - all, however, within the same central theme. According to Lindquist the amulet contains a solemn prayer to the Earth Goddess, referred to as 'Erka', 'Fold' and 'Undirgoð' (:the god beneath) and her 'single son' Thor.

Two of Lindquist's suggested interpretations are:
{{bq|text=Here I, in poetry am familiar with the god(dess) beneath, for me, Bófi, to save myself. Earth, I am known to thee! May the one son keep evil away from Bófi. May Þórr protect him with the hammer that smashes Ámr, the heavy Ámr. Flee, foul ill-wight! Get nothing from Bófi. Gods are under him and over him.}}

Also:
{{bq|text=I here to Erka, the undergod of the world, for me, Bófi, to save myself. Earth, I am known to thee! And may the lightning raiser help evil from Bófi. May Þórr protect him with the hammer that smashes Ámr. Go the sea, Ámr! Flee, foul ill-wight! Get nothing from Bófi. Gods are under him and over him.}}

On etymological grounds Lindquist reasons that Ámr is a demon of sickness.

===Börje Westlund 1989===
According to Westlund, Lindquist's attempts at deciphering the "bind runes" at the beginning of the inscription are misguided. In Westlund's opinion these are not complicated bind runes but elaborate forms of normal runes. To support his claim he compares the runes with an inscription found near [[Novgorod]] in 1983 and treated by the Russian runologist Elena Melnikova in 1987. This is material not available to Lindquist and Nilsson.

Westlund reads the first runes as "hiristikþirbirkbufi" and takes them to mean (in standardized West Norse) "Hér rísti ek þér björg Bófi." which would come out in English as "Here I carve protection for you, Bófi." This is a major change from Lindquist's interpretation. Instead of Bófi being the carver talking about himself we have a separate carver that addresses Bófi in the inscription.

Westlund goes on to refuse Lindquist's "prayer to Earth" in favor of a more magical interpretation. While he rejects Lindquist's interpretation of "me&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;fultihuþis" ("with Earth in mind") and Nilsson's interpretation of "samhu&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;hafikam" ("that came from the sea") he does not offer alternative explanations. On the whole he suggests that Lindquist read too much into the inscription and tries to go for a more "mundane" solution to the problem. His transliteration and translation of the whole inscription follow:

'''x hiristik þi&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt; birk / bufi me&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt; fultihu''' / '''þis þe&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt; uis in bral''' / '''tilu fran bufa þor keti h''' / '''ans mi&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt; þem hamri samhu&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;''' / '''hafikam fly fran iluit fe&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt; eki af bufa kuþ i&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;u''' / '''unti&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt; hanum auk yfi&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt; han''' / '''um'''
{{bq|text=Here I may carve (or: I carved) protection for you, Bófi, with&amp;nbsp;.. is certain to you. And may the lightning keep evil (away) from Bófi. Thor Protect him with that hammer&amp;nbsp;... Flee from the evil being! It (?) gets nothing from Bófi. Gods are under him and over him.}}

In his conclusion Westlund rejects Lindquist's view of the amulet as a solemn heathen prayer. In his opinion the mention of Thor and 'the gods' reflect a post-conversion magical view of the heathen gods. He even goes as far as suggesting that the wearer of the amulet was probably a baptised Christian.

===Ottar Grønvik 1992===
In 1992 [[Ottar Grønvik]] offered a new interpretation which is essentially an attempt to rehabilitate Lindquist's work. Lindquist's bind-runes are brought back into play.

:'''h(i)&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;iurkimsuti&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;kuþi&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;birk'''
:'''bufime&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;fultihu'''
:'''þisþe&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;uisinbral'''
:'''tilufranbufaþorketih'''
:'''ansmi&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;þemhamrisamhy&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;'''
:'''hafikamflyfraniluit'''
:'''fe&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;ekiafbufakuþi&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;u'''
:'''unti&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;hanumaukyfi&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;han'''
:'''um'''

===Jonna Louis-Jensen 2001===
In 2001 [[Jonna Louis-Jensen]] continued in the same vein as Grønvik with an interpretation involving a sickness demon named ''Ámr''. She offers the following normalized text and English translation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8940">'''Legal responses to agunah''' are civil legal remedies against a spouse who refuses to cooperate in the process of granting or receiving a Jewish legal divorce or ''"[[Get (divorce document)|get]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;John Kleefeld and Amanda Kennedy (2008). "‘A Delicate Necessity’: ''Bruker v. Marcovitz'' and the Problem of Jewish Divorce" ''Canadian Journal of Family Law'' 24: 205–282 http://ssrn.com/abstract=1937546&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agunah==
{{main|Agunah}}
For a divorce to be effective under [[Jewish law]], a man must grant his wife a Jewish divorce—a ''get''—of his own free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=agunahinc|url=http://libfindaids.yu.edu:8082/xtf/view?docId=ead/agunahinc/agunahinc.xml;query=;brand=default|work=[[Yeshiva University]]|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes a Jewish woman can be held in a so-called "limping marriage" when her husband refuses co-operation in the religious form of divorce. She may have received a civil divorce but cannot remarry within her religion, meaning that for all intents and purposes, she may not be able to remarry at all—a phenomenon known as ''[[agunah]]''. Where one party has the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce, that power can be used as a bargaining tool to pressure the other party to agree more favourable divorce terms. A parallel problem—sometimes called "male agunah"—can arise when the wife refuses to respond to the husband's attempts to initiate the ''get'' process, such as refusing to appear before a rabbinical tribunal for the proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Schonfeld, "The Male Agunah – The Untold Story" (December 24, 2009). http://www.schonfeldandgoldring.com/the-male-agunah-the-untold-story&lt;/ref&gt; Although the consequences are not as serious for the man, the result can still be a form of extortion to agree to agree to the other party's demands.

==Canada==

Since 1990 Canada's [[Divorce Act (Canada)|Divorce Act]] permits the Court hearing the divorce to strike out the application, pleadings and/or affidavit evidence of a party creating a barrier to the religious remarriage of their spouse.&lt;ref&gt;Divorce Act, RSC 1985 c. 3 at s. 21.1&lt;/ref&gt;  

In ''Bruker v. Marcovitz,'' the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that, in the Province of [[Province of Quebec|Quebec]], a condition of a contract between two spouses that required the husband to give his wife a ''get'' was enforceable. The court overturned a decision from the [[Court of Appeal of Quebec]] which held that as the substance of the obligation was religious in nature, the obligation was a moral one and was therefore unenforceable by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;''Bruker v. Marcovitz'' [http://scc.lexum.org/decisia-scc-csc/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2397/index.do &lt;nowiki&gt;[2007]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3 SCR 607].&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court's decision, written by Justice [[Rosalie Abella]], restored the trial decision of Mass J., who had ordered a total of $47,500 in damages: $2,500 for each of the 15 years that the husband had refused to grant the ''get'', and $10,000 for Ms. Bruker’s inability to have children considered “legitimate” under Jewish law. 

==New York==

In [[New York State|New York]], a court cannot enter a judgment of annulment or divorce unless any barriers to religious remarriage by a spouse, the removal of which are within the control of the other spouse, have been removed. Section 253 of the Domestic Relations Law (the so-called "First New York Get Law") provides that, in a contested divorce, any applicant whose marriage was solemnised by a religious celebrant must file a statement that:

:he or she has taken, or will take, all steps within his or her power to remove all barriers to the other spouse’s remarriage; or

:the other spouse has waived in writing the applicant’s obligation to file the statement.
In an uncontested divorce both parties must file such a statement or waive the obligation of the other party to do so. The court cannot enter a final judgment of divorce or [[annulment]] unless it receives the statements and, even then, final judgment cannot be entered if the person who solemnised the marriage swears that, to his or her knowledge, the applicant has failed to take all steps within his or her power to remove all barriers to the other party’s religious remarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural-community Divorce and the Family Law Act 1975: A proposal to clarify the law|work=FAMILY LAW COUNCIL|date=August 2001|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==

In Australia, the Family Court in ''Gwiazda v Gwiazda''&lt;ref&gt;No. M10631 of 1992 [unreported]&lt;/ref&gt; ordered a reluctant wife to appear before the Beth Din in Melbourne. Emery J. observed that:

:If I correctly understand the intention of the Act, then it is the clear duty of a judge of this court to ensure that appropriate orders are made fully effective, not only in theory but in fact. In this case the husband as a matter of law can marry any woman who is free to marry, subject only to the prohibitions in the Marriage Act, but as a matter of fact and practicability he cannot do so."

So-called "Gwiazda Orders" are now occasionally used when necessary to produce a fair result by requiring the parties to refer their problems to the local Beth Din. The Australian Law Commission has proposed that the [[decree nisi]] should not become absolute and, in any other proceedings except those relating to a child, the court should have the power to adjourn the proceedings.

==United Kingdom (England and Wales)==

Within the United Kingdom, in [[England and Wales]], the [[Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002]], relates to Jewish divorce. The Act allows a Court discretionary right to award any ''[[Tort|damages under Tort remedies]]'', impose any civil or criminal fines or other penalties, or to grant any further relief, and withhold the final legal civil dissolution of a marriage of Jews or of other person by means of granting the ''[[decree absolute]]'' until a declaration made by both parties that they have taken such steps as are required to dissolve the marriage in accordance with rabbinical law.

In case law, there have been a number of cases regarding the provision of a ''get'': in the case of ''O v O'',&lt;ref&gt;''O v O (Jurisdiction: Jewish Divorce)'' [2000] 2 FLR 147&lt;/ref&gt; the wife petitioned for a civil divorce and was granted a ''decree nisi''. As she had not been granted a get, she did not apply for a ''decree absolute''. The husband attempted to apply for it under s9(2) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, but was denied until the get had been granted.

==South Africa==

Section 5A of the Divorce Act, 1979 provides that the court may refuse a divorce decree if one spouse does not take steps necessary to dissolve the marriage (or to allow the other spouse to remarry) in accordance with religious custom. The court may also make any other order which it finds to be just. This provision was added in 1996 as a result of the [[South African Law Reform Commission]]'s report on Jewish divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/dojcd-acts-promoted-since94.pdf |title=Statutes promoted by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development which have been enacted since 27 April 1994 |publisher=Department of Justice and Constitutional Development (South Africa) |page=7 |date=March 1, 2010 |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clauses at marriage==
{{main|Lieberman clause}}
The Lieberman clause, developed by Rabbi [[Saul Lieberman]], does not deal with secular law, but instead inserts, at the time of marriage, a ''halakhic'' stipulation that the marriage is only valid on the condition that the man gives a ''get'' within 6 months of any secular court's divorce.  Were the man to refuse to give a ''get'', the marriage would be declared null retroactively—it would be as if the couple were never married from a Jewish legal perspective.

The Hillsong Church started in Australia and from there spread as a Pentecostal movement.The [[Hillsong Church]] has produced hundreds of Christian songs on CDs since 1992 on over 50 albums, mostly under their own label, [[Hillsong Music]].

Below is a list of songs arranged alphabetically by title. Italicised song titles indicate an instrumental recording. Italicised album names indicate an instrumental album. A number in brackets after the song title means that there have been different songs with the same name. If a particular song is on more than one album, all albums are listed alphabetically. A number in brackets after the album name indicates the ''version'' number of that song in chronological order. If they are the same number, it means they are the same recording.

''Note: Songs from the (non-English) Hillsong Ukraine albums are not listed.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7492">{{Dates for Easter}}  
This is a '''list of dates for [[Easter]]'''. The Easter dates also affect when [[Ash Wednesday]], [[Good Friday]], [[Holy Saturday]], [[Maundy Thursday]], the [[Ascension of the Lord]] and [[Pentecost]] occur. Easter may occur on different dates in the [[Gregorian Calendar]] and the [[Julian Calendar]]. The accompanying table provides both sets of dates, for recent decades and forthcoming years — see the [[computus]] article for more details on the calculation.

== Earliest Easter ==
===Western (Gregorian)===

In 1818 the [[Paschal Full Moon]] fell on Saturday, March 21 (the [[equinox]]). Therefore, the following day, March 22, was Easter. It will not fall as early again until 2285, a span of 467 years. The next earliest Easter between 1818 and 2285 (March 23) occurred in 1845, 1856, 1913 and 2008, and will occur again in 2160—an 11, 57, 95 and 152-year gap, respectively.

===Orthodox (Julian)===

The earliest dates for Easter in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] between 1875 and 2099 are April 4, 1915 and April 4, 2010 (Gregorian). Both dates are equivalent to March 22 in the [[Julian Calendar]].

== Latest Easter ==
===Western (Gregorian)===

In 1943 Easter fell on Sunday, April 25. The [[ecclesiastical full moon]] did not occur until Saturday, March 20; because it came before the [[vernal equinox]], the paschal full moon did not happen until Sunday, April 18. Consequently, Easter was the following Sunday (April 25). Easter will not fall as late again until 2038—a span of 95 years. The second latest date for Easter, April 24, occurred in 2011. The last time this occurred was in 1859 and will not happen again until 2095—spans of 152 and 84 years. However between 5121 and 6482, Easter will be no later than April 24.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

===Orthodox (Julian)===

The latest dates for Orthodox Easter between 1875 and 2099 are May 8, 1983, and May 8, 2078 (Gregorian). Both dates are equivalent to April 25 in the Julian Calendar. Orthodox Easter has never fallen on Gregorian May 7 yet; it will happen in 2051 unless these churches change to another calendar.

== Western and Orthodox Easter on the same date ==
Despite using calendars that are apart by 13 days, Easter 2014 fell on the same date. According to the Western (Gregorian) calendar, the first Paschal Full Moon after the Spring Equinox (March 20) fell on Monday, April 14, 2014. The following Sunday, April 20, was, therefore, Easter Day.

According to the Orthodox (Julian) calendar (which is 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar), the Spring Equinox also falls on March 21. However, in the Gregorian Calendar, this is April 3. The first Orthodox Full Moon after the Equinox falls on (Julian) Tuesday, April 2, 2014 (Gregorian April 15). The following Sunday, (Julian) April 7, is, therefore, Easter Day (Gregorian April 20).

== Range of dates for Western and Orthodox Easter ==
Both calendars (Gregorian and Julian) calculate Easter as falling on dates between March 22 and April 25 on their calendars. However, because of the 13-day difference, any member of an Orthodox church would observe that the Western Easter falls between March 10 and April 12 on the Julian calendar. Conversely, any member of a Western church would observe that Orthodox Easter falls between April 4 and May 8 on the Gregorian calendar.

Beginning March 14, 2100 (February 29, 2100, in the Julian Calendar), the difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars will increase to 14 days.

== Public holidays ==
{{Expand section|details of Easter holidays in other countries; this section currently only mentions those with a four-day weekend|small=no|date=April 2018}}
In [[Hungary]], the [[United Kingdom]] (except [[Scotland]]), [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[New Zealand]], Easter comprises two public holidays, [[Good Friday]] and [[Easter Monday]], making a four-day weekend. The moveable date of Easter sometimes brings it into conflict with other, fixed, public holidays.
*In the United Kingdom in 2000 and 2011, the [[May Day]] bank holiday was one week after Easter Monday, causing there to be three consecutive weeks with a bank holiday. (In Scotland this did not occur as Easter Monday is not a bank holiday.) In 2011, a bank holiday was declared on Friday 29 April for the [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/uk/royal-wedding-bank-holiday|title=Royal Wedding Bank Holiday in the United Kingdom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently there were four bank holidays within three consecutive calendar weeks (including two in one week), creating two consecutive four-day weekends (Friday 22 — Monday 25 April and Friday 29 April — Monday 2 May), with a three-day working week in between (Tuesday 26 — Thursday 28 April).
*In [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 2008, [[Saint Patrick's Day]] (Monday 17 March) fell six days before Easter (Sunday 23 March), creating a three-day week (Tuesday 18 — Thursday 20 March). This will next happen in 2035, when Saint Patrick's day falls on Saturday, so the public holiday is moved forward to the following Monday 19 March, again six days before Easter.
**Note that in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[liturgical calendar]], saints' feasts are not observed when they fall during [[Holy Week]]; this caused Saint Patrick not to appear in the liturgical calendar for 2008; 17 March was simply celebrated as Holy Monday.

*In Australia, [[ANZAC Day]] is a public holiday on 25 April. In 2000 and 2011, this created a five-day weekend over Easter: in 2000, Easter Monday fell on 24 April, with Easter Tuesday, 25 April, then being ANZAC Day; in 2011, ANZAC Day and Easter Monday coincided on Monday 25 April, which led to a substitute public holiday being declared for Tuesday 26 April.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.officeholidays.com/countries/australia/2011.php&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 and 2014, ANZAC Day fell on Easter Friday, and in 2019 it will fall on Easter Thursday, and in 2038 it will fall on Easter Sunday; the consequence is three-day working weeks immediately following the Easter weekend.

'''Middle Eastern studies''' (sometimes referred to as '''Near Eastern studies''') is a name given to a number of academic programs associated with the study of the history, culture, politics, economies, and geography of the [[Middle East]], an area that is generally interpreted to cover a range of nations including [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], [[Syria]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]], and [[Oman]]. It is considered a form of [[area studies]], taking an overtly interdisciplinary approach to the study of a region. In this sense Middle Eastern Studies is a far broader and less traditional field than classical [[Islamic Studies]].

The subject was historically regarded as part of [[Oriental studies]], which also included [[East Asian studies]] and [[Egyptology]] and other specialisms in the ancient civilizations of the region; the growth of the field of study in the West is treated at that article. Many academic faculties still cover both areas. Although some academic programs combine Middle Eastern Studies with [[Islamic Studies]], based on the preponderance of [[Muslim]]s in the region (with Israel and Lebanon being the only exceptions), others maintain these areas of study as separate disciplines.

==Contentious issues==
In 1978 [[Edward Said]], a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[United States of America|American]] professor of [[Comparative Literature]] at [[Columbia University]], published his book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', in which he accused earlier scholars of a "subtle and persistent [[Eurocentric]] prejudice against [[Arab]]o-Islamic peoples and their culture", claiming the bias amounted to a justification for [[imperialism]]. While other academics such as [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Irwin]] challenged Said's conclusions,&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;[[Flemming Rose]]: ''Forsvar for en profession'' [Defence of a profession], interview with Prof. Robert Irwin, ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'', 12 April 2008, section 1, page 17 (accessed via [http://infomedia.dk Infomedia.dk] and [http://www.jyllands-posten.dk/protected/premium/kultur/ECE3946459/forsvar-for-en-profession/ the newspaper's website])&lt;/ref&gt; the book soon became a standard text of [[literary theory]] and [[cultural studies]].

Israeli-American historian [[Martin Kramer]] in his 2001 book ''Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America'' accused Middle Eastern studies programs of ignoring the mounting threat of [[Islamic terrorism]]. In a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article published in 2001, Kramer claimed that Middle Eastern studies courses, as they stood, were "part of the problem, not its remedy". In a ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' review of the book, [[F. Gregory Gause]] said his analysis was, in part, "serious and substantive" but "far too often his valid points are overshadowed by academic score-settling and major inconsistencies."&lt;ref name="FGregoryGause"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57822/f-gregory-gause-iii/who-lost-middle-eastern-studies|title='Who Lost Middle-Eastern Studies?'|last1=Gause|first1=F.G.|date=March–April 2009|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[United States|American]] writer [[Daniel Pipes]] established an organisation called [[Campus Watch]] to combat what he perceived to be serious problems within the discipline, including "analytical failures, the mixing of politics with scholarship, intolerance of alternative views, apologetics, and the abuse of power over students". He encouraged students to advise the organization of problems at their campuses. In turn critics within the discipline such as [[John Esposito]] accused him of "[[McCarthyism]]".

In 2010, [[foreign policy]] analyst [[Mitchell Bard]] claimed in his 2010 book ''[[The Arab Lobby: The Invisible Alliance That Undermines America's Interests in the Middle East]]'' that elements of the [[Arab lobby in the United States|Arab lobby]] particularly [[Saudi Arabia]] and pro-[[Palestinian Arabs|Palestinian]] advocates were hijacking the academic field of Middle Eastern studies within several prominent American universities including [[Georgetown University]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Columbia University]].{{sfn|Bard|2010|pp=284; 306–11}} This has involved [[Saudi Arabia]] and other [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf States]] funding centers and chairs at universities to promote a pro-[[Arabist]] agenda.{{sfn|Bard|2010|p=284}} Bard has also accused several prominent Middle Eastern studies academics including [[John Esposito]] and [[Rashid Khalidi]] of abusing positions by advancing a pro-Palestinian political agenda.{{sfn|Bard|2010|pp=293–94; 307–08}}

In addition, Bard has criticized the Middle Eastern Studies Association (MESA) for adopting a pro-Palestinian standpoint. Bard has also alleged that MESA marginalizes non-Israel-related topics including the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict]] and the persecution of religious minorities like [[Christians]] and ethnic minorities that are non-Arabs such as [[Jews]] and [[Kurds]].{{sfn|Bard|2010|pp=295–97}} Finally, Bard has contended that since the [[September 11 attacks]], the Arab lobby working through Middle Eastern Studies university departments have sought to influence [[K–12 (education)|pre-university]] education by tailoring education programs and resources to reflect a pro-Arabist agenda.{{sfn|Bard|2010|pp=284; 322–23}}

The '''Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM)''' ([[translation]]: ''Muslim National Forum'')  is a Muslim organisation in [[India]], affiliated to the  [[Hindu nationalist]] [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS). It was formed in 2002 at the initiative of the then RSS chief [[K.S. Sudarshan]] to allow the [[Sangh Parivar]] to reach out to Muslims. Sher haidar Khan and Syed Adil Muneer Andrabi are media persons of it&lt;ref name="Hindustan Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Raza|first1=Danish|title=The saffron Muslim|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-saffron-muslim/article1-1174455.aspx|accessdate=4 October 2014|work=Hindustan Times|date=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and activism==
The MRM was founded with the stated aim of bringing  Muslim communities close to Hindus in India. It states that Muslim suspicions of the RSS and its affiliates are misplaced, and that the [[Indian National Congress]] is responsible for a leadership within the Muslim community.&lt;ref name="Hindustan Times"/&gt; The MRM has also expressed support for many of the causes espoused by the RSS, including the banning of cow-slaughter.&lt;ref name="Hindustan Times"/&gt; Its national convener, Mohammed Afzal, stated that the organisation faced significant resistance in the days following the [[Godhra train burning]] and the [[2002 Gujarat riots]].&lt;ref name="Hindu March 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dahat|first1=Pavan|title=Follow your conscience: RSS to appeal to Muslims|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/follow-your-conscience-rss-to-appeal-to-muslims/article5743803.ece|accessdate=5 October 2014|work=The Hindu|date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009 the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind]], one of the largest Islamic organisations in India, passed a resolution describing ''[[Vande Mataram]]'' as an un-Islamic song. The MRM expressed opposition to the resolution. Afzal stated "Our Muslim brothers should not follow the fatwa as Vande Mataram is the national song of the country and every Indian citizen should respect and recite it." The MRM stated further that Muslims who refused to sing it were opponents of both Islam and India.&lt;ref name="Sharma2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sat D. Sharma|title=India Marching: Reflections from a Nationalistic Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYNRtwvYSi8C|date=1 May 2012|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-4759-1423-8|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim organisation slams Vande Mataram fatwa|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/muslim-organisation-slams-vande-mataram-fatwa/539079/|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=Nov 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2008, MRM organised a ''Paigham-e-Aman'' (message of peace) ''yatra'' from the [[Red Fort]] in [[Delhi]] to Kashmir in support of land allocation for the [[Amarnath Temple|Amarnath]] pilgrimage. Led by the Jharkhand Shahee-Imam Moulana Hizb Rehman Merthi, the 50 activists of the yatra were initially stopped at the border of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. They were later allowed to go to Jammu where they held meetings with the ''Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti''.

One thousand volunteers took a pledge against terror and vowed to campaign against it in their home districts.&lt;ref name=anti-terror/&gt; In September 2012, the MRM organised a signature campaign to revoke [[Article 370]] of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]], which grants limited autonomy to the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], and claimed to have collected 700,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=7 lakh Muslims have signed up for revoking Art 370: RSS outfit |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/7-lakh-muslims-have-signed-up-for-revoking-art-370-rss-outfit/1051675/ |newspaper=Indian Express |date=29 December 2012 |accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In the [[Indian general election, 2014|2014 general election]], the MRM campaigned for [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] candidate [[Narendra Modi]]. Afzal stated that the MRM would attempt to reach out to 50 million Muslims before the election.&lt;ref name="Hindu March 2014"/&gt; When questioned about Modi's involvement in the Gujarat riots, Afzal stated:
{{cquote|"Had Mr. Modi been involved in the riots, his police would not have fired 1,200 rounds and killed over 200 rioters. Every court has acquitted him. And there is not a single incident of communal violence in Gujarat in the past 12 years.”&lt;ref name="Hindu March 2014"/&gt;}}

In 2015, the Muslim Rashtriya Manch published a book title "Yoga and Islam" on universal appeal and acceptance of Yoga. The Manch expressed its views that 'Yoga' does not have anything to do with religion, further stating that "Namaaz is one sort of Yoga asana". The move was supported by the Union [[Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy]] (AYUSH) but Hindu groups expressed reservations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-pushes-yogas-universal-appeal-ministry-releases-book/article7326995.ece Govt. pushes yoga’s universal appeal, Ministry releases book], The Hindu, 18 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2401">'''Piran Gushnasp''', also known by his [[baptized]] name of '''Grigor''', was an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] commander from the [[House of Mihran]]. In the early 6th century, he was appointed as the new governor (''[[marzban]]'') of [[Sasanian Iberia|Iberia]]. Between 540-542 he converted to [[Christianity]], assuming the Christian name of Grigor. However, this made his family boycott all contact with him, and he was soon executed in 542 at [[Anbar (town)|Peroz-Shapur]] due to [[apostasy]]. A companion of Piran, Yazd-panah, was also executed.

'''Nijanand Sampradaya''' is a community that believes in the Supreme Truth God "Raj Ji" . The Muslim followers consider Prannath  Ji as the "Last Imam Mehndi" and Hindu followers as "Budh Nishkalank Kalki Avatar" a title conferred to him at a [[Kumbh Mela|Kumbha Mela]] at [[Haridwar]] in 1735 [[Vikram Samvat]] (1678 A.D).

==History==
The founder of the sect, Shri Devchandra Ji Maharaj (1581–1655), was born in [[Sindh]] province in [[Umarkot]] village of India (now in ''Pakistan''). From early childhood, he showed saintly tendencies. At the age of 16, he renounced the world and left in search of Brahma-gyana (divine knowledge) to [[Bhuj]] in [[Kutch]] and later to [[Jamnagar]]. Devchandraji undertook the work of giving concrete shape and form to find a new stream of religion called '''Nijanand Sampradaya'''. He settled down in [[Jamnagar]], where form he explained [[Veda]]s, [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] knowledge and [[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagwatam]] in simple language intelligible to lay persons irrespective of social class and religious differences, and awaken them to their real Self with the help of divine knowledge called "Tartam". His followers later came to be known as '''Sundarsaths''' or '''Pranami'''.&lt;ref name=a&gt;[http://www.pranami.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=93&amp;Itemid=70 Pranami Faith : Saints of Pranami Dharma : Texts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;[http://www.nijanand.org/new/nijanand_samprayaday.htm Nijanad Sampradaya]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=c&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kKiNGwAACAAJ The Pranami Faith: Beyond `Hindu’ and `Muslim’- Dominique-Sila Khan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=d&gt;[http://prannathjiresearch.com/live/VisvaPranamiDharm.aspx Vishava Pranami Dharma]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The credit of spreading the Pranami sampraday goes to his dearest disciple and successor, Mahamati Shri Prannathji (Mehraj Thakur) (1618–1694), who was the son of Keshav Thakur, [[Dewan|Diwan]] of [[Jamnagar]] State. He traveled throughout the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian world including Oman, Iraq and Iran to spread the ideals of religious harmony and interfaith understanding the vision of Tartam professes. Through him was revealed the divine knowledge later compiled as the holy "Kuljam Swaroop" in six languages - [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]] and also words of many other prevalent languages. His work called Kuljam Swarup a.k.a. Tartam Sagar is worshipped unlike the idols in Shree Krishna Pranami temples worldwide. He also attended [[Haridwar Kumbh Mela|Kumbh Mela]] at [[Haridwar]] in 1735 BS (1678 AD) and was engaged in religious debates in which he conveniently became victorious and was conferred the title of "Niskalanka Bijayaabhinand Buddha Avatar" by the saints of various sects and creeds.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name=c/&gt;&lt;ref name=d/&gt;

[[Maharaja]] [[Chhatrasal]] (1649–1731) of [[Bundelkhand]], was an ardent disciple of Mahamati Prannathji and a follower of  Pranami Dharma. Their meeting took place in [[Mau]] in 1683, a place near [[Panna, India|Panna]]. His nephew Dev Karanji who had met Swami Prannathji, earlier in [[Ramnagar, Varanasi|Ramnagar]], was instrumental for this meeting. Chhatrasal was highly impressed of Prannathji and became his disciple. When Maharaja Chhatrasal came to meet him, he was going for a battle against [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s. Swami Prannathji gave him his own sword and covered his head with a scarf, saying, "You will always be victorious. Diamond mines will be discovered in your land and you will become a great emperor." His prophecy came true and even today [[Panna District|Panna region]] is famous for their diamond mines. Swami Prannathji was not only the religious Guru of Chhatrasal; but he guided him too in political, social, and economic matters. It was by being granted the boon of finding diamonds in Panna by Swami Prannathji that Maharaja Chhatrasal became prosperous.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name=c/&gt;&lt;ref name=d/&gt;

Among other notables - [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s mother, [[Putlibai]], belonged to Pranami sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Identity and religion: foundations of anti-Islamism in India By Amalendu Misra|year=2004|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLgB8pZg0qsC&amp;pg=PA67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mohandas: A True Story of a Man, His People, and an Empire By Gandhi|year=2006|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TEyXCoc76AEC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi in his book ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|My Experiments With Truth]]'' mentions about this sect -  "Pranami is a sect deriving the best of both the [[Quran]] and [[Bhagvad Gita|Gita]], in search of one goal - God."&lt;ref name=ag&gt;{{cite book|title=The Agony of Arrival: Gandhi, the South Africa Years by Nagindas Sanghavi|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-wNpAHzgfAC&amp;pg=PT38&amp;dq=putlibai+pranami&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XrIRUs3jEsSmrAf994D4Bg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=putlibai%20pranami&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veerat===
It offers a stratified knowledge from the Hell (Purgatory) all the way to the Supreme Abode of the Lord Supreme Paramdham and enumerates everything in between. This holy text explains the history and reason behind the creation of this relative world among many facets of creation. It also gives the history of Adinarayana, who is considered by many 
as the Lord Supreme as well as Trinity (Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh) and many other details of the divine intention behind Creation.

===Vriti/Charchani===
The detailed enumeration of the Abode of the Lord Supreme Aksharateeta Shri Raj Ji/Khuda as indicated in scriptures.

"''Chidadityam Kishorangam Paredhamni Viraajitam
Swaroopam Satchindanandam Nirbikaram Sanaatanam''"

Brahmabaibart Purana

''"The Lord Supreme resides in his effulgent Abode (Paramdham) in his ever radiating youth form. Devoid of all the natural impurities, he is engrossed with Existence-Knowledge-Bliss features and is eternal."''

===Beetak Saheb (History)===
It is the history of the advent of this great philosophy called Tartam that is to remove the darkness of spiritual misunderstanding and the biography of the founders of this faith Satguru Devchandra Jee and Mahamati Prannath Jee whose lives serve as inspiration for those who aspire to realize divinity and eternal bliss. The account of their lives recorded by the awakened soul Swami Lal Das Jee, the consort of the Lord Supreme and many other awakened souls outline
the ways for enlightenment and Salvation.

Many other books written by the leaders of the Pranami Faith and other religious scholars are available for readers to reflect on in many libraries and Pranami Temples and institutions worldwide.

==Rites and rituals==

{{main|Christianity in Burma}}
'''Protestants in Burma''' make up 3% of that nation's population, many of them [[Baptists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Burma | date= 8 November 2008 | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html |publisher=CIA World Factbook |accessdate=21 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Protestant Churches of Burma were begun in the early 19th century by [[Adoniram Judson]], an American [[Baptist]] [[missionary]]. Since the 19th century, Christianity has become deeply rooted and has grown stronger through many adversities.

In 1966 all missionaries were expelled by the Burmese government, but the Burmese Church has become a vibrant missionary-sending movement, despite financial limitations and geographic isolation. Baptists, [[Assembly of God|Assemblies of God]], [[Methodist]]s and [[Anglican]]s form the strongest denominations in Burma. Many Christians are well-educated, but cannot rise to positions of responsibility.

Most Christians are from the minority ethnic groups such as [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Lisu people|Lisu]], [[Jingpo people|Kachin]], [[Chin people|Chin]], and [[Lahu people|Lahu]]. An estimated 0.1 per cent of the [[Bamar]] population is Christian.

==Anglicanism==
The [[Anglican Communion]] is represented in Burma by the [[Church of the Province of Myanmar]]. {{As of|2006}}, it has about 62,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;World Council of Churches, 1 January 2006, [http://www.oikoumene.org/es/iglesias-miembros/regions/asia/myanmar-burma/church-of-the-province-of-myanmar.html Church of the Province of Myanmar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706150812/http://www.oikoumene.org/es/iglesias-miembros/regions/asia/myanmar-burma/church-of-the-province-of-myanmar.html |date=6 July 2008 }}. Retrieved 13 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baptist==
The '''[[Myanmar Baptist Convention]]''' is an association of [[Baptist]] churches in Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Myanmar Baptist Convention|title=Myanmar Baptist Convention: Who We Are|url=http://mbc-1813.org/?view=whoweare|website=Myanmar Baptist Convention|accessdate=28 November 2014|language=Burmese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous American Baptist missionaries, [[Adoniram Judson|Adoniram and Ann Judson]], moved to [[Yangon]] in 1813 when British authorities refused to allow them to stay in [[India]]. The Judsons were in Burma six years before their first convert was baptised. Adoniram Judson gathered a group of believers and laboured under many trials, but his missionary tenure of almost 40 years helped firmly establish the Baptist work in Myanmar. His monumental work included translating the Bible into [[Burmese language|Burmese]], which was completed in 1834. [[George Dana Boardman]] began a work among the [[Karen people|Karen]] peoples in 1828. Today the ''Karen Baptist Convention'' is the largest member body of the '''''Myanmar Baptist Convention''''', which was formed in 1865.

[[HIV/AIDS]] is a significant problem in Myanmar. In 1992, the Baptist Convention created a 32-member AIDS commission, because they see the problem as spiritual, as well as social and medical.

In Myanmar about 6% of the population is Christian, with two-thirds of them being considered Protestant. Almost half of these Protestants are Baptists. In 2012, the Convention had over 1.6 million members in 4929 churches. The Myanmar Baptist Convention has 18 affiliated conventions and two directly affiliated local churches under its umbrella, and is a member of the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].

During 5–8 December 2013 Myanmar Baptist Convention celebrated its 200th anniversary arrival of missionary Judson. They are actively planning to evangelise all the unreached people groups of it and plant as many as 1200 churches in their project entitled: Golden Myanmar Baptist Mission, Second Decade(2014-2024).

The Convention operates the [[Myanmar Institute of Theology]], the leading Christian [[seminary]] in Myanmar, founded in 1927 and located in [[Insein Township|Insein]].

==Methodist Church==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[Methodist]] missionaries entered the country along with the British once Myanmar became a British colony in the late 1800s. Methodists established, similarly to the Anglicans, schools in the country, most notably the Methodist English High School in [[Yangon]], mostly to educate the Anglo-Burmese and British. The school exists to this day and today is known as Dagon State High School but still attached the Methodist Church.

The [[United Methodist Church]] works with the Lower Myanmar Methodist Church which was founded by American Methodist missionaries over 100 years ago. The Upper Myanmar Methodist Church was planted by British Methodists. The two are in discussion about merging. They already conduct joint missions.

The Lower Myanmar Methodist Church began under the British. The [http://www.umcmission.org/Explore-Our-Work/Asia-and-Pacific/Burma-Myanmar#sthash.rXNsoIfI.dpuf Lower Myanmar Methodist Church] concentrates on leadership development through scholarships and continuing education. It also provides a home for the elderly, helps youth develop job skills, cares for orphans and provides environmental education.

'''Qasr el Banat''' ([[Arabic]]: قصر البنات) is an ancient [[temple]] (probably Roman) situated {{convert|1.5|km|mi}} east of Chlifa in the [[Baalbek District]] of the [[Beqaa Governorate]] in the city of [[Qsarnaba]] ([[Lebanon]]).&lt;ref name="Taylor1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Taylor|title=The Roman temples of Lebanon: a pictorial guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXchNqgyNdkC|accessdate=1 November 2012|year=1967|publisher=Dar el-Machreq Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keel1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Othmar Keel|title=The Symbolism of the Biblical World: Ancient Near Eastern Iconography and the Book of Psalms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fy4B1iMg33YC&amp;pg=PA158|accessdate=1 November 2012|year=1997|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-014-9|pages=158–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

It is believed the site was called the ''Castle of Virgins'' and was the residence of [[virgin]]s in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Syria - Lebanon|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MCTszTdofMkC|publisher = Hunter Publishing, Inc|date = 1998-01-01|isbn = 9783886181056|first = Wolfgang|last = Gockel|first2 = Helga|last2 = Bruns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = History of the Maronites: Relig[i]ous, Cultural, and Political|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7CbZAAAAMAAJ|publisher = B. Dau|date = 1984-01-01|first = Butros|last = Dau}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Indeed the arab world "Qasr" comes from the latin "castra" (meaning in English: "castle").

By the middle of the 2nd century, the Romans built many small temples and other sanctuaries in the vicinity of the temple district of Heliopolis, today's [[Baalbek]], on the edge of the Bekaa. They were pilgrimage destinations for the inhabitants of the big cities on the coast. One of the Roman processional streets led - partly carved out of the rock - from here directly to the mountain temples of Hosn Niha. One of the most famous is the one in the village of [[Qsarnaba]], called actually "Castra El Banaat".

George F. Taylor classified Qasr el Banat among a group of ancient Roman [[Temples of the Beqaa Valley]]. It is suggested to date to [[Ancient Roman]], but it is possible that was originally built -as a very small temple- during  [[Ancient Greek]] eras or earlier. The temple is located on a rocky plateau, accessible by a climb up a hill at an altitude of 1100 meters. The top of the hill is covered in various platforms, [[cistern]]s, tanks and steps that have been carved out of solid bedrock. Within the remains is a small [[antae temple]], constructed of large square blocks that was used as a [[fortress]] in later times. Some sections remain intact built up two or three layers high. A [[basilica]] (probably byzantine Christian) from a later period was built alongside the temple.&lt;ref name="Taylor1967"/&gt;

There are two circular structures located around {{convert|100|m|ft}} southeast of the temple that are thought to have been examples of
the [[high place]]s referenced in the [[Bible]].

==Characteristics==

The ''Prostylos Temple'' of [[Qsarnaba]], with the entrance on the east side, stood on a high platform, reached by a wide flight of steps with over 20 steps. The walls of the podium were moved to the east and formed a lateral conclusion of the stairs. The mighty limestone curbs of the former Cella wall, which are distributed on the site, are weathered to some extent to the shapelessness. In 1974, the first phase of the restoration was completed, in which up to three rows of temple walls could be restored. In the middle section of the cella, the stepped base of a raised cult place can be seen. A separate sacrificial altar stands outside in the east at the foot of the staircase. 

It was composed of parts and supplemented in a further restoration phase after 1993. The columns of the vestibule were crowned by Corinthian capitals.
Individual parts of the pediment triangle were assembled in the original form and placed as a whole at ground level next to the temple. In the upper cornice, a carved relief bust is preserved at the top of the gable. It shows the bearded head of a man who probably represents the founder of the building.

'''Ramanand Dass''' was a leader of the [[Dera Sach Khand]], a follower of [[Ravidas]].

His name came to international attention when he was murdered at the age of 57 in a 24 May 2009 [[Vienna temple attack|attack on the Guru Ravidass Temple]] in [[Austria]]. Rama Nand suffered multiple gunshot wounds and died in hospital early on 25 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8066005.stm&lt;/ref&gt; The attack triggered rioting across much of Northern India. He was cremated with full state honors on 4 June 2009, in [[Ballan, India|Ballan]], [[India]].

The relationship between '''religion and schizophrenia''' is of particular interest to [[psychiatrists]] because of the similarities between [[religious experience]]s and [[psychosis|psychotic episodes]]; religious experiences often involve [[auditory hallucination|auditory]] and/or [[visual hallucination]]s, and those with schizophrenia commonly report similar hallucinations, along with a variety of beliefs that are commonly recognized by modern medical practitioners  as delusional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Murray, ED. | author2=Cunningham MG | author3=Price BH | title=The role of psychotic disorders in religious history considered | journal=J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neuroscience | volume=24 | issue=4 | pages=410–26 | doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214 | pmid=23224447| year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, religion has been found to have "both a protective and a risk increasing effect" for schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Gearing, Robin Edward, Dana Alonzo, Alex Smolak, Katie McHugh, Sherelle Harmon, and Susanna Baldwin. "Association of religion with delusions and hallucinations in the context of schizophrenia: Implications for engagement and adherence." ''Schizophrenia research'' 126, no. 1 (2011): 150-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common report from those with schizophrenia is some type of religious belief that many medical practitioners consider to be delusional - such as the belief they are divine beings or prophets, that [[God]] is talking to them, they are possessed by demons, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siddle|first=Ronald |author2=Haddock, Gillian |author3=Tarrier, Nicholas |author4=Faragher, E.

"Relationship between spirituality/religiousness and coping in patients with residual schizophrenia." Quality of Life Research 20.7 (2011): 1053-1060.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of patients with schizophrenia that had been previously admitted to a hospital, 24% had what the medical field refers to as religious delusions.

Trans-cultural studies have found that such religious beliefs, which often may not be associated with reality, are much more common in patients with schizophrenia who identify as Christian and/or reside in predominately Christian areas such as Europe or North America.&lt;ref name="Tateyama"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tateyama M, Asai M, Hashimoto M, Bartels M, Kasper S |title=Transcultural study of schizophrenic delusions.

==Background==
{{Main|Schizophrenia}}
Schizophrenia is a complex [[Psychosis|psychotic disorder]] in which symptoms include emotional blunting, intellectual deterioration, social isolation, disorganized speech and behavior, delusions, and hallucinations. The causes of schizophrenia are unclear, but it seems that [[heredity|genetics]] play a heavy role, as individuals with a family history are far more likely to suffer from schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="van Os 635–45"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Os|first=J|author2=Kapur, S |title=Schizophrenia.|journal=Lancet|date=2009-08-22|volume=374|issue=9690|pages=635–45|pmid=19700006|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60995-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Picchioni|first=MM|author2=Murray, RM |title=Schizophrenia.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2007-07-14|volume=335|issue=7610|pages=91–5|pmid=17626963|doi=10.1136/bmj.39227.616447.BE|pmc=1914490}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The disorder can be triggered and exacerbated by social and environmental factors, with episodes becoming more apparent in periods of high [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. Neurologists have found that the schizophrenic brain has larger ventricles (fluid-filled cavities) compared to a well brain. This is hypothesized to be due to loss of nerve cells.&lt;ref name="UCLA Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Page|first1=Dan|title=UCLA Researchers Map How Schizophrenia Engulfs Teen Brains|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/UCLA-Researchers-Map-How-Schizophrenia-2701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms usually appear around the onset of early adulthood.&lt;ref name="van Os 635–45"/&gt;  It is rare for a child to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, in part because of the difficulty in establishing what erroneous thoughts and beliefs can be attributed to childhood development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul|title=Egocentrism|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/preoperational.html|website=simplepsychology.org|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which thoughts and beliefs can be attributed to schizophrenia. With [[psychiatric medication]] (usually [[antipsychotic]]s) and therapy, individuals with schizophrenia can live successful and productive lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/lib/atypical-antipsychotics-for-schizophrenia/|title=Grohol, John M., Dr. "Atypical Antipsychotics for Schizophrenia."

== Role of religion in schizophrenia treatment ==

It has been shown in longitudinal studies that those suffering from schizophrenia have varying degrees of success when religion plays a significant role in their recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohr|first=S.|title=Toward an Integration of Spirituality and Religiousness Into the Psychosocial Dimension of Schizophrenia|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 November 2006|volume=163|issue=11|pages=1952–1959|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.11.1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It would seem that the use of religion can either be a helpful method of coping with the disorder, or it can be a significant hindrance in recovery. Especially for those who are active in a [[religious community]], religion can also be a very valuable tool in coping with the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danbolt|first=Lars J.|title=The Personal Significance of Religiousness and Spirituality in Patients With Schizophrenia|journal=International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|date=31 March 2011|volume=21|issue=2|pages=145–158|doi=10.1080/10508619.2011.557009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helman|first=DS|title=Recovery from schizophrenia: An autoethnography|journal=Deviant Behavior|date=2018|volume=39|issue=3|pages=380–399|doi=10.1080/01639625.2017.1286174}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be difficult, however, to distinguish if a religious experience is genuine to the spiritual person, or if it is a positive symptom of the illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koenig|first=Harold G.|title=Religion, spirituality and psychotic disorders|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0101-60832007000700013&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Archives of Clinical Psychiatry (São Paulo)|volume=34|pages=95–104|doi=10.1590/S0101-60832007000700013|issn=0101-6083|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where a skilled and reliable therapist can help. Provided that a [[mental health professional|therapist]] is open to the use of religion in one's treatment, and that the patient is open and receiving said treatment, it is entirely possible to tie religion in with professional therapeutic aids and [[medication]] in order to meet a desirable goal. Those who are involved in their church and are spiritual on a daily basis, while getting psychiatric treatment have reported fewer symptoms and a better quality of life. They learn to see their religion as a source of hope rather than a tormenting reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohr|first=S|author2=Huguelet P |title=The relationship between schizophrenia and religion and its implications for care|journal=Swiss Medical Weekly|url=http://www.smw.ch/docs/pdf200x/2004/25/smw-10322.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion as a trigger for schizophrenia ==
{{POV|date=April 2017}}
Schizophrenia can be triggered by a variety of environmental factors, including significant stress, intensely emotional situations, and disturbing or uncomfortable experiences. It is possible that religion itself may be a trigger for schizophrenia; religious imagery is often very grandiose, and defies commonly held beliefs of what is realistic and natural in the world. Experiencing an intense religious experience may trigger a psychotic episode in those who are vulnerable to them, because religion often requires a believer to suspend their usual idea of what is possible and impossible. This could potentially lead to a psychotic episode due to the shift in realistic thinking; a sufferer may believe that they themselves are [[Deity|religious deities]] or [[Messiah]]s, or that God himself is speaking to the individual. These symptoms may cause violent behavior, either on others or themselves because of taking passages in religious texts literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.117.217&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=The relationship between schizophrenia and religion and its implications for care|first1=Sylvia|last1=Mohr|first2=Philippe|last2=Huguelet|journal=Swiss Med Weekly|year=2004|volume=134|pp=369–376|via=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, they may also experience more distress-inducing symptoms if they believe that God is using their illness as a punishment. Religion, depending on how the patient views it, can be paralyzing and quite harmful, in that the patient may refuse treatment based on religious beliefs; in certain instances, one might believe that their delusions and hallucinations are actually a divine experience, and therefore deny any treatment.  It has been shown that those with schizophrenia who suffer from religious delusions are more religious than those who do not suffer from these delusions.&lt;ref name="Mohr 1095–1103"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohr|first=Sylvia |author2=Borras, Laurence |author3=Rieben, Isabelle |author4=Betrisey, Carine |author5=Gillieron, Christiane |author6=Brandt, Pierre-Yves |author7=Perroud, Nader |author8=Huguelet, Philippe|title=Evolution of spirituality and religiousness in chronic schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorders: a 3-years follow-up study|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|date=11 October 2009|volume=45|issue=11|pages=1095–1103|doi=10.1007/s00127-009-0151-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been shown that those who suffer from religious delusions are less likely to continue long-term treatment.

The [[Boy Scouts of America]] use many '''Scout Prayers'''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} All packs/dens/troops should keep a '''"Prayer Book"'''; one Scout takes it home each week and inscribes in it his own prayer to read out at the end of a meeting.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Official prayers are widely used by groups that don't use a Prayer Book or when the Prayer Book is not available. Different groups use slight variations of these.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} This happens from an incorrect teaching of the prayer, an adaptation for a specific country, or other reasons.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==The Scout Prayer==

Used by the [[Boy Scout|Scout]] section.

&lt;poem&gt;Almighty and everlasting God,
By whose grace thy servants are enabled to fight
The good fight of faith and ever prove victorious;
We humbly beseech thee so to inspire us
That we may yield our hearts to thine obedience
And exercise our wills on thy behalf.
Help us to think wisely,
To speak rightly,
To resolve bravely,
To act kindly,
To live purely.
Bless us in body and soul
And make us a blessing to our comrades.
Whether at home or abroad
May we ever seek the extension of thy kingdom.
Let the assurance of thy presence
Save us from sinning,
Strengthen us in life and comfort us in death.
O Lord our God, accept this prayer
We pray to the lord,
Amen.
&lt;/poem&gt;


&lt;poem&gt;Dear Heavenly Father,

Help to keep my honor bright
And teach me that integrity of character
Is my most priceless possession.

Grant that I may do my best today,
And strive to do even better tomorrow.

Teach me that duty is a friend and not an enemy,
And help me face even the most disagreeable task cheerfully.

Give me the faith to understand my purpose and life,
Open my mind to the truth and fill my heart with love.

I am thankful for all the blessings you have bestowed upon my country.
Help me to do my duty to my country and
To know that a good nation must be made from good men.

Help me to remember my obligation to obey the Scout Law,
And give me understanding, so that it is more than mere words.

May I never tire of the joy of helping other people or
Look the other way when someone is in need.

You have given me the gift of a body,
Make me wise enough to keep it healthy,
That I might serve better.

You are the source of all wisdom,
Help me to have an alert mind,
Teach me to think,
And help me to learn discipline.

In all that I do and in every challenge I face,
Help me to know the difference between right and wrong,
And lead me in obedience on a straight path to a worthy goal.

Amen.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==The Scout Law Prayer==

(This prayer is designed to demonstrate the [[Scout Law]])

&lt;poem&gt;Dear Lord, Bless all those everywhere who contribute to shape the hearts, minds and bodies of young people.  Let us remember what they have taught and apply it daily.

When facing deceit and dishonesty, let us be Trustworthy.
If we see hypocrisy and faithlessness, let us be Loyal.
Where disregard of others and mere materialism prevail, let us be Helpful.
When we find people in despair, let us be Friendly.
In an atmosphere of ill manner, let us be Courteous.
Where some measure manliness in brutality and crudeness, let us be Kind.
Though lawbreaking and rule-scoffing are common, let us be Obedient.
While others grumble and grouch, let us be Cheerful.
In an environment blighted by waste and extravagance, let us be Thrifty.
When confronted with danger and temptation, let us be Brave.
As we see filth and pollution everywhere, let us be Clean.
While witnessing impiety, let us remember to be Reverent.

In short, in a world that has for generation after generation lamented the lack of good examples, let us, as Scouts, stand out, grow up, and become real adults.

Amen.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==The Venturer Prayer==

Used by the [[Venture Scout]] section.
&lt;poem&gt;
Lord, We thank you for letting us come once again to marvel at your creations. We hope that those in the group who are new to this activity will leave with the same sense of wonder that we always feel as we step into a cave.
We treat these activities as fun, but always with a sense of wonder at the thousands of years required to create even the smallest of the features at which we look.
Help us to preserve your work, both for ourselves and for future generations of Scouts and Cavers.

Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;

==The Rover Prayer==

The rover prayer is based upon the prayer of St [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and was adopted by [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]] for use by the [[Rover Scout]] section.

&lt;poem&gt;By the Spirits of the Just,
Made perfect in their suffering;
Teach us in our turn, O Lord;
To serve thee as we ought: 
To give, and not to count the cost,
To fight, and not to heed the wounds,
To toil and not to seek for rest
To labor and not to ask any reward,
Save that of knowing that we do thy will.

Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;

Originated at [[Gilwell Park]].

&lt;poem&gt;Oh Lord,

'''Seohaean baeyeonsingut''' is a shamanistic [[exorcism ritual]] that takes place on top of a boat in the Korea's West Coast region. It is performed to the gods to ask for abundant catches of fish at sea. It's South Korea's Important Intangible Cultural Properties 82-2.

July 7 is the day when [[fishermen]] lost at sea can see the [[Big Dipper]], the brightest stars that will help them find their way like a compass. From olden times, Koreans believed that the Big Dipper was the [[constellation]] of stars that controlled the time of space and human lives. That is why humans have prayed for health and happiness in the direction of the Big Dipper.
On the night of July 7, popular folklore also has it that two love stars, [[Gyunwoo]] and [[Jiknyu]], meet and form the beautiful galaxy. This is another reason why the exorcism is held on this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/Tv2/ALegacy_Archive.asp?PROG_CODE=TVCR0301&amp;view_cont_seq=8&amp;code=St1&amp;sys_lang=Eng|title=Seohaean Baeyeonsingut, Exorcism for Abundant Fishing|date=September 12, 2007|publisher=Arirang TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seohaean Baeyeonsingut were performed annually in the villages in [[Haeju]], [[Ongjin County, South Hwanghae|Ongjin]] and the [[Yeonpyeong Island]] of [[Hwanghaedo]], [[North Korea]], with a prayer for peace in the village and a good catch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrich.go.kr/eng/info/video_list.jsp?vid=v01_39.jsp|title=Seohaean Baeyeonsingutmit Daedonggut (Baeyeonsingut and Daedonggut of the western coast)|date=September 12, 2007|publisher=National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exorcism is performed as a prayer to the gods of the heaven and the sea.
It is believed that the rite is more effective if performed by a [[shaman]] ({{lang-ko|[[Mudang]]}}), so it is traditionally performed with one.

'''Sharana''' ([[Kannada]]:ಶರಣ) meaning "to surrender" denotes egoless surrender and refuge in [[Shiva]], the [[Deity]] of [[Hinduism]]. In practice, the word ''sharana'' refers specifically to a person who is a follower (a bhakta or a seeker) of the Lingayat tradition. &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;M. R. Sakhare, History and Philosophy of the Lingayat Religion, Prasaranga, Karnataka University, Dharwad&lt;/ref&gt; Sharanas through centuries were responsible for the spread of [[Lingayatism]] in [[India]].

==History==
In the literature and imagery predating LaVey, imagery used to represent the "Satanic" is denoted by inverted crosses and blasphemous parodies of Christian art. The familiar [[goat]]'s head inside an inverted [[pentagram]] did not become the foremost symbol of Satanism until the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=20}} The original goat pentagram containing the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] at the five points of the pentagram spelling out [[Leviathan]] first appeared in the book ''La Clef de la Magie Noire'' by French occultist [[Stanislas de Guaita]], in 1897. This symbol was later used in Mourice Bessy's book ''A Pictorial History of Magic and the Supernatural'', with the words "[[Samael]]" and "[[Lilith]]" removed. During his years of research into the “Black Arts,” LaVey had come across this book and added it to his collection. When he chose to turn his magic circle, the "Order of the Trapezoid,” into the Church of Satan, he decided that the symbol was the one which most fully embodied the principles which were the bedrock of the Satanic church. Contrary to claims made against the Church by detractors, LaVey never claimed to have created this particular symbol.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=20}} In its formative years, this particular version of the symbol was utilized by the Church on membership cards, stationary, medallions and most notably above the altar in the ritual chamber of the [[Black House (Church of Satan)|Black House]]. During the writing of ''The Satanic Bible'', it was decided that a unique version of the symbol should be rendered to be identified exclusively with the Church. The complete graphic now known as the ''Sigil of Baphomet'', named such for the first time in LaVey's ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]'', first appeared on the cover of ''The Satanic Mass LP'' in 1968 and later on the cover of ''The Satanic Bible'' in 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|pp=20–21}} This version was drawn by LaVey and attributed to "Hugo Zorilla" (a pseudonym used by LaVey in some of his art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIfdkgicKhIC|title=The Re-Enchantment of the West, Vol 2: Alternative Spiritualities, Sacralization, Popular Culture and Occulture|last=Partridge|first=Christopher|date=2006-06-20|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780567041234|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and is trademarked by the Church.

{{Slavic Native Faith}}
'''[[Slavic Native Faith]]''' ('''Rodnovery, Orthodoxy, Vedism''') '''in [[Russia]]''' is widespread, according to some estimates from research organisations which put the number of Russian Rodnovers in the millions. The Rodnover population generally has a high education and many of its exponents are intellectuals, many of whom are politically engaged both in the right and the left wings of the political spectrum. Particular movements that have arisen within Slavic Native Faith in Russia include [[Ynglism]], [[Peterburgian Vedism]], [[Meryan Rodnovery]] and [[Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism]]. Rodnovery in Russia is also influenced by, and in turn influences, movements which have their roots in [[Russian cosmism]] and identify themselves as belonging to the Vedic spectrum, such as [[Ivanovism]] and [[Rerikhism]].

==Demographics==
===Social composition of Russian Rodnovery===
[[File:Ivan Kupala Day in Serebryany bor 2017 67.jpg|thumb|Celebration of [[Kupala Night]].]]
Aitamurto observed that a "substantial number" of adherents—and in particular those who had been among the earliest—belonged to the "technical intelligentsia".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} Similarly, Shnirelman noted that the founders of Russian Rodnovery were "well-educated urbanized intellectuals" who had become frustrated with "cosmopolitan urban culture".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=88}}  [[Physics|Physicists]] were particularly well represented; in this Aitamurto drew comparisons to the high number of computer professionals who were present in the Pagan communities of Western countries.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} The movement also involved a significant number of people who had a background in the Soviet or Russian Army,{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1a2=Gaidukov|1y=2013|1p=147|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2013|2p=73}} or in policing and security.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=73}} The "vast majority" of Russian Rodnovers were young and there were a greater proportion of men than women.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} A questionnaire distributed at the Kupala festival in Maloyaroslavets suggested that Native Faith practitioners typically had above-average levels of education, with a substantial portion working as business owners or managers.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=121}} A high proportion were also involved in specialist professions such as engineering, academia, or information technology, and the majority lived in cities.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|pp=121–122}}

Shnirelman informs that Rodnovery in Russia is embraced by many politically engaged philosophers, both of the right- and the left-wing. The former group is represented by Vladimir Andeyev, Anatoly Ivanov, Pavel Tulaev (members of the Moscow Slavic Community and founders of the New Right journal ''Ateney''), Aleksei Trekhlebov from [[Krasnodar]], Valery Demin from [[Omsk]], and the [[Saint Petersburg]] journalists Oleg Gusev and Roman Perin, among others.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=68}} Ivakhiv reports that they have a "surprisingly extensive" influence.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=216}} The well-known Rodnover leader Velimir (Nikolai Speransky), who is the founder of the politically neutral federation Circle of Pagan Tradition, classifies Valery Yemelyanov, ''[[volkhv]]'' Dobroslav (Aleksei Dobrovolsky), Vladimir Istarkhov and Igor Sinyavin as representatives of right-wing Rodnovery; according to him, the Union of Slavic Rodnover Communities founded by Vadim Kazakov and the "Church of Nav" (Це́рковь На́ви, ''Tsérkov' Návi'') generally lean towards the right-wing. The left-wing of the spectrum would be represented, instead, by Anton Platov, Aleksandr Asov and Aleksandr Khinevich (founder of [[Ynglism]]), though they keep most of their religious activities outside of politics.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|pp=62–63}} Since the 1990s, [[Traditionalist School]] thinkers—chiefly [[René Guénon]] and the Italian Pagan philosopher [[Julius Evola]]—have been translated and introduced in the very mainstream of Russian thought by the philosopher [[Aleksandr Dugin]], who has an influential position at the heart of contemporary Russian academic and political life.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=23}}

A number of youth subcultures have been identified as introducing people to Rodnovery, among them heavy metal, historical re-enactment, and the admirers of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|pp=158–159}} Rodnovery is also spread through a variety of newspapers and journals.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=68}} Also popular with Russian Rodnovers has been the martial arts movement known as ''Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba''.{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=317}} A number of popular celebrities, including singer [[Maria Arkhipova]] and professional boxer [[Aleksandr Povetkin]],{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}} have publicly embraced Rodnovery.

===Growth and estimates of the number of Rodnovers in Russia===
[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 Ирина 53.jpg|thumb|A ''kolo'', ritul circle of Russian Rodnovers.]]
Writing in 2000, Shnirelman noted that Rodnovery was "growing rapidly" within the Russian Federation.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} In 2016, Aitamurto noted that there was "no reliable information" on the number of Rodnovers in Russia, but that it was "plausible" that there were "several tens of thousands" of practitioners active in the country.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=63}} This was partly because there were several Rodnover groups active on the social network [[VK (social networking)|VK]] which had over 10,000 members.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=63}}

A 2012 survey of religion in Russia estimated that there were 1,700,000 practitioners of "traditional religions of gods and ancestors" in the federation as of that year.&lt;ref name="ArenaAtlas"&gt;[http://sreda.org/en/arena "Arena: Atlas of Religions and Nationalities in Russia"]. Sreda, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Of them, 44% were ethnic [[Russians]] and Roman Lunkin, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences (IERAS)' Institute of Europe, who was among the surveyors, recognised the growing presence of Native Faiths among them.&lt;ref name="Filina"&gt;Olga Filina. [https://www.rbth.com/articles/2012/08/30/mapping_russias_religious_landscape_17819.html "Mapping Russia’s religious landscape"]. ''Ogoniek'', August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Marlene Laruelle]] suggested that Rodnovery was likely to remain a marginalised religion in comparison to Russian Orthodoxy, but that its main significance for Russian society had been by diffusing "historical themes"—particularly regarding an ancient [[Aryan]] race—to a far wider audience, including many who were Orthodox or non-religious.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=298}} Rodnovery has been spreading rapidly in the [[North Caucasus]] region of Russia, especially among communities of [[Cossacks]] and in the [[Stavropol]] region, where in some areas it already has a dominant position. It has been reported that even former priests of the Russian Orthodox Church have joined their ranks.&lt;ref name=Kucherov&gt;Kucherov, Nikolai. [http://kavpolit.com/articles/neokazachestvo_i_neojazychestvo-14110/ "Неоказачество и неоязычество (Neocossackism and neopaganism)"]. ''Kavpolit'', 16/02/2015. [https://web.archive.org/web/20170521002928/http://kavpolit.com/articles/neokazachestvo_i_neojazychestvo-14110/ Archived 21/05/2017].&lt;/ref&gt;

A polemical piece entitled ''Adversus paganos'', published in 2015 by the official journal of the Ascension Cathedral of [[Astrakhan]], cites sociological data saying that Native Faiths are already formally embraced by "more than 2 million Russians", while the number of people affected by Rodnover ideas is several times larger. This is based on data provided in 2012 by Igor Zadorin, the director of the research institute "Tsirkon", who said that in Russia the proportions of atheists, Orthodox Christians and "pagans" are of comparable sizes and their populations overlap: Orthodox Christians are 30% of the total population; people who have some sort of "pagan", non-Christian spirituality, are 40% of the population, while the remaining population is composed of a 20% who are atheists, and a 10% who are believers of other religions (4-7% ethnic minorities professing [[Islam]]).&lt;ref name="Adversus paganos"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Belov |first1=Maxim |last2=Garanov |first2=Yuri |date=10 February 2015 |title=Adversus Paganos |publisher=Journal of the Ascension Cathedral of Astrakhan |website=astrsobor.ru |url=http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523191143/http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-date=23 May 2017 |access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movements paralleling Rodnovery and mutual influences==
===Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism===
{{Main|Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism}}
[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 Ирина 85.jpg|thumb|Building a house at a Ringing Cedars' kinship settlement.]]
The Ringing Cedars (Звенящие Кедры) or Anastasianism is a spiritual movement that overlaps with Rodnovery, but is not thoroughly part of it. Many Anastasians are Rodnovers, while others are not. The Ringing Cedars' movement arises from the writings of [[Vladimir Megre]] (Puzakov), codified in a series of ten books, whose teachings are attributed to an [[archetype|archetypal]] Siberian wise woman known as Anastasia.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=52}} These books teach what Rasa Pranskevičiūtė has defined as a "cosmological [[pantheism]]",{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=446}} in which nature is the manifested "thought of God" and human thought has the power to commune with him and to actively participate in his creation.{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|pp=450–451}}

Anastasians have established rural villages all over Russia, "kinship homesteads" (родовое поместье, ''rodovoye pomest'ye''), where they conduct a harmonious life in at least a hectare of land. The name "Ringing Cedars" derives from the beliefs held by Anastasians about the spiritual qualities of the [[Pinus sibirica|Siberian cedar]]. In his writings, Megre identifies the ideal society which the Ringing Cedars' movement aims at establishing as "Vedic", and many of his teachings are identical to those of other movements of Rodnovery.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=52–53}}

===Russian Zoroastrianism—Blagovery===
[[Zoroastrianism]] emerged as a public entity in Russia in the 1990s, created by Russians themselves despite the normally endogamic essence of the traditional Zoroastrian communities existing in [[Iran]] and [[India]]. The first Zoroastrian organisation, the "[[Avesta]]n School of Astrology" (shortened "[[Asha]]", which, in the oldest texts known as ''Arta'', is the Persian word defining the agency of cosmic harmony), was established by Pavel Globa (1953–) in the early 1990s, and opened dozens of branches in and outside of Russia. Globa had been teaching Avestan astrology since the 1970s, and in the 1990s he had become a nationally acknowledged expert on the subject. Globa presents himself as the heir of a lineage of [[Zurvanism]] (the type of Zoroastrianism that regards Zurvan, i.e. "Time" and "Whole", as the supreme God) from north-west Iran, allegedly transmitted through his great grandmother and his maternal grandfather Ivan N. Gantimurov.&lt;ref name=Stausberg-Tessmann2013&gt;{{cite article |last1=Stausberg |first1=Michael |last2=Tessmann |first2=Anna |year=2013 |title=The appropriation of a religion: The case of Zoroastrianism in contemporary Russia |url=http://bora.uib.no/bitstream/handle/1956/8922/Stausberg%20and%20Tessmann_Culture%20and%20Religion.pdf?sequence=4 |journal=Culture and Religion |volume=14 |number=4 |pages=445–462 |doi=10.1080/14755610.2013.838800 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712155356/http://bora.uib.no/bitstream/handle/1956/8922/Stausberg%20and%20Tessmann_Culture%20and%20Religion.pdf?sequence=4 |archive-date=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|449–450}} Some of Globa's pupils were initiated by he himself into a priesthood (''khorbad'').&lt;ref name=Stausberg-Tessmann2013/&gt;{{rp|451}}

In 1994 the "Zoroastrian Community of Saint Petersburg" was established by Globa's followers and officially registered. The organisation publishes the magazine ''Mitra'' and the newsletter ''Tiri''. The Zoroastrianism that they propose is a consciously mimetic appropriation of the religion as it is practised among traditional Zoroastrian communities. This recreation involves significant changes; for instance the cords that are worn by initiates around their waist are not white woollen cords as in the original tradition, but are three-coloured cords—yellow, red and blue—symbolising, according to Globa, the three colours of Zurvan.&lt;ref name=Stausberg-Tessmann2013/&gt;{{rp|452}} Since 2001, the priest of Iranian origins Kamran Jamshidi initiated new Avestan astrologers in [[Minsk]], and Russia became a mission field for them. Tensions arose as Jamshidi's initiates challenged the authority of Globa. Under the influence of these new missionaries, another organisation was founded in [[Moscow]] in the year 2005, the "Russian Anjoman" (Русский Анджоман; ''anjoman'' is a Persian word meaning "assembly"). They use the term of Russian origin "Blagovery" (Благоверие ''Blagoverie'', literally "Good Faith") to define their Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref name=Stausberg-Tessmann2013/&gt;{{rp|453}}

Russian Zoroastrian communities, whether belonging to the Peterburger or Muscovite movements, emphasise that Zoroastrianism has Russian origins, and traces of it have been preserved in Slavic folklore. This parallels the discourse of Rodnovery, and one of the early Rodnover ideologues, Anatoly Ivanov, defined his views as "Zoroastrian" and "Avestan". In 1981, Ivanov even published the anti-Christian text entitled ''Zarathustra Did Not Speak Thus: The Basics of the Aryan Worldview'', inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', wherein Ivanov says that Zoroastrianism should be adopted as a new paradigm for humanity and discusses the eschatology of the [[Saoshyant]].&lt;ref name=Stausberg-Tessmann2013/&gt;{{rp|454–455}} Zoroastrianism has been described by Stausberg and Tessmann as a "permanent discussion topic" within the Rodnover community.&lt;ref name=Stausberg-Tessmann2013/&gt;{{rp|455}} As it is the case for Rodnovers, the site of [[Arkaim]] has great importance for Russian Zoroastrians/Blagovers, since it is believed that the "Aryan prophet" [[Zoroaster]] lived there.&lt;ref name=Stausberg-Tessmann2013/&gt;{{rp|453}} In 2007, during an interview with Iranian state media, Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] himself declared that Zoroastrianism originated in the southern part of the [[Ural Federal District|Ural region]] of Russia, and it is the base of all major world religious systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=16 October 2007 |title=Интервью Иранскому Гостелерадио и информационному агентству "ИРНА" |publisher=President of Russia (Президент России) official website |website=kremlin.ru |url=http://kremlin.ru/appears/2007/10/16/2243_type63377type63379type82634_148471.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021031631/http://kremlin.ru/appears/2007/10/16/2243_type63377type63379type82634_148471.shtml |archive-date=21 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siberian shamanism—Tengrism===
Many Rodnovers are influenced by Central Asian or [[Siberian shamanism]] and its modern organised form, [[Tengrism]], which has become widespread in easternmost regions of Russia. One of the earliest exponents of Rodnovery, [[Moscow State University]]-graduated psychologist Grigory Yakutovsky (1955–, known as a shaman by the name Vseslav Svyatozar; his surname reveals a possible [[Yakuts|Yakut]] ancestry), asserted that ancient Slavic religion was fundamentally shamanic, and Siberian shamanism plays a central role in his formulations. In Yakutovsky's Rodnovery, Slavic gods are secondary in importance compared to goddesses, and he claims that this was typical of ancient Slavic religion. Yakutovsky's form of Rodnovery has been defined as "tolerant, pluralistic and pacifistic"; his teachings are also representative of the minority of Rodnovers who identify as [[communism|communists]]. Yakutovsky is critical of the Soviet type of communism, and rather proposes "social communism" as the ideal form of government for the future. He also espouses a form of elitism, by recognising shamans (poets and mystics) as a minority of people characterised by greater intelligence and power devoted to the realisation of a better future for humanity.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=32}}

According to the scholar of religion [[Mircea Eliade]], original [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] is closer to Central Asian shamanism than to the later Near Eastern and Mediterranean religions, as proven by their shared crucial concepts: the supreme God of Heaven (cf. Indo-European ''[[Dyeus]]'', Siberian ''[[Tengri]]'', and Mesopotamian ''[[Dingir]]'') and the three-layered structure of cosmology (cf. Sanskrit ''[[Trailokya]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eliade |first=Mircea |authorlink=Mircea Eliade |title=Patterns in Comparative Religion |year=1958}} p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rodnover fine arts==
The rise of Rodnovery, and its rapid growth as a multidimensional phenomenon, has brought to the establishment of an artistic scene as part of such multidimensionality. Many professional artists, many of whom are outspokenly Rodnover themselves—some even priests, have emerged with works discussing themes of history, mythology and everyday life. Their works are highly appreciated and celebrated within the Rodnover community. Studies on Rodnover art have found that [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev]] is one of the preferred subjects among other historical themes, epic heroes and other human prototypes (even including the appropriation of saints of the Russian Orthodox Church).&lt;ref name=Gizbrekht2016&gt;Gizbrekht, Andrey Ivanovich (2016). [https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/obrazy-deyateley-rossiyskoy-istorii-v-diskurse-sovremennogo-yazycheskogo-iskusstva-na-materiale-izobrazitelnogo-tvorchestva "Образы деятелей российской истории в дискурсе современного «Языческого искусства» (на материале изобразительного творчества) / The images of public figures of Russian history in the discourse of modern "Pagan art" (based on fine arts material)"]. Краснодарского государственного института культуры. УДК 298.9:7.044/.046.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian artists of Rodnover themes include Aleksandr Borisovich Uglanov, Andrey Alekseyevich Shishkin, Andrey Guselnikov, Andrey Klimenko, Boris Olshansky, Igor Ozhiganov, Leo Khao, Maksim Kuleshov, Maksim Sukharev, Maximilian Presnyakov, Nella Genkina, Nikolay Speransky, Radomir Semochkin, Viktor Korolkov, Vladimir Pingachov, Vsevolod Ivanov.&lt;ref name=Gizbrekht2016/&gt; Another artist, whose works are widely appreciated within the Rodnover community, was [[Konstantin Vasilyev]] (1942–1976).{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=26}}

==Russian Rodnovers' militarisation and involvement in the War in Donbass==
Rodnovery has a significant role in the [[War in Donbass]], with many Rodnovers forming or joining armed forces. Some of them—for example those of the Svarozich Battalion—have been fighting in favour of Russia; other Rodnovers—such as those of the [[Azov Battalion]]—have taken the side of Ukraine.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}} The war has stirred different reactions among Rodnovers in Ukraine; those belonging to the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] viewed Russia as the aggressor, while adherents of other Rodnover organisations like the Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith more commonly saw Russians and Ukrainians as brothers and believed that the conflict was caused by the machinations of the United States.{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|pp=133–134, 140–141}}

Russian Rodnover military formations in [[Donbass]] include the Svarog, Varyag and Rusich formations, and Rodnovers within the [[Russian Orthodox Army]]. Observers have highlighted that Russian Rodnovers have been proselytising in the region, with the endorsement of Russia, under the name "Orthodoxy" and preaching the concept of a new "Russian World", and that their beliefs have even permeated the Orthodox Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Ageyev |first=Vyacheslav |title=Neo-paganism and Russian Orthodoxy – an explosive mix of religion and ideology |url=http://ahamot.org/en/neo-paganism-and-russian-orthodoxy-an-explosive-mix-of-religion-and-ideology/ |date=27 August 2015 |conference=XXI World Congress of the International Association for the History of Religions (IAHR), 23–29 August 2015 |location=Erfurt, Germany |conference-url=http://www.iahr2015.org/iahr/2249.html |accessdate=7 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707163055/http://ahamot.org/en/neo-paganism-and-russian-orthodoxy-an-explosive-mix-of-religion-and-ideology/ |archive-date=7 July 2017}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170707162828/http://www.iahr2015.org/iahr/2249.html Archived pertinent panel of the XXI IAHR conference].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the outbreak of the war, though not necessarily in connection with it, Rodnover and Orthodox Christian military groups have also sprung up in the Russian capital [[Moscow]], reportedly dividing the capital into respective zones of influence, "cities within the city" with their own armed forces, with support from local security officials. Rodnover soldiers often help the local population in its opposition to the Orthodox Christian hierarchy's plans to build new churches around the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=6 April 2016 |title=Neo-Pagan and Orthodox Militants 'Dividing Up' Russian Capital |website=The Interpreter |url=http://www.interpretermag.com/neo-pagan-and-orthodox-militants-dividing-up-russian-capital/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707163246/http://www.interpretermag.com/neo-pagan-and-orthodox-militants-dividing-up-russian-capital/ |archive-date=7 July 2017 |accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Swami Ghanananda was born in a Senya Beraku village, [[Central Region, Ghana|central region]] of Ghana on 12 September into a native Ghanaian faith, but his parents converted to Christianity. From a very early age he thought about the mysteries of the universe and tried to find the answers in religious texts.&lt;ref name="Ghana's unique African-Hindu"/&gt;

===Journey to India===
Swami Ghanananda then read some books on the Hindu faith and embarked upon a new journey which took him to [[Rishikesh]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Uttarakhand]] in northern India. He spent some time there with a spiritual guru who suggested him to open the monastery in Accra.&lt;ref name="Ghana's unique African-Hindu"/&gt;

===First meeting with Swami Krishnananda===
In 1962, Swami Ghanananda moved to Accra and on 24 November, he formed the Divine Mystic Path Society. He then started correspondence courses on the Hindu way of life ([[Sanatana_Dharma#Dharma|Sanatana Dharma]]) with the Divine Life Society of Rishikesh, located in the foothills of the [[Himalaya]]s in northern India, where he first met [[Swami Krishnananda]] of India and became his [[Guru-shishya tradition|śishya]] (disciple), and then in 1975 Swami Krishnananda initiated Swami Ghanananda as a [[swami]].&lt;ref name="Ghana's unique African-Hindu"/&gt;

The '''Temple of Taffeh''' ({{lang-ar|معبد طافا}}) is an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temple]] which was presented to the [[Netherlands]] for its help in contributing to the historical preservation of Egyptian antiquities in the 1960s.

'''''Thuja standishii''''' ('''Japanese thuja'''; ''nezuko'', ''kurobe'') is a species of [[thuja]], an [[evergreen]] [[conifer]]ous [[tree]] in the cypress family [[Cupressaceae]]. It is native to southern [[Japan]], where it occurs on the islands of [[Honshū]] and [[Shikoku]]. It is a medium-sized tree, reaching 20–35&amp;nbsp;m tall and with a trunk up to 1 m diameter.

The foliage forms in flat sprays with scale-like [[leaf|leaves]] 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm long, matte green above, and with narrow white [[stomata]]l bands below. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are oval, yellow-green ripening red-brown, 6–12&amp;nbsp;mm long and 4–5&amp;nbsp;mm broad (opening to 8&amp;nbsp;mm broad), with 6–10 overlapping scales.

It is an important timber tree in Japan, grown in [[forestry]] [[plantation]]s for its durable, waterproof, attractively scented [[wood]].

There is some evidence that extracts of Thuja standishii have biological activity. It contains a compound called [[Standishinal]] which has shown relatively potent effects on the [[Aromatase]] enzyme. It acts as an inhbitor, thus decreasing the synthesis of [[Estradiol]] in the human body. This compound has been used in research and derivatives of it have shown even stronger inhibition of Aromatase.

The '''''Titii''''' (or '''''Titii sodales''''', later '''''Titienses''''', '''''Sacerdotes Titiales Flaviales''''') was a college ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sodalitas|sodalitas]])'' of [[Religion in ancient Rome#Priesthood, politics and religious law|Roman priests]]. 

==Origins==
There are two versions of how the college was established. One credits [[Titus Tatius]] with creating the college to superintend and preserve the ''Titienses'', one of the three original tribes ''([[Tribe#Etymology|tribus]])'' in the [[Kingdom of Rome|Regal period]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' I. 54&lt;/ref&gt; which may have represented the [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] tribe of [[Sabines]]. The other says that [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] created it in honour of king Tatius, who after his death was worshipped as a god.&lt;ref&gt;Tacit. Hist. II. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] the Titii are no longer mentioned,{{Dubious|date=May 2010}} as the [[Cult (religion)|cults]] of all Italic tribes became gradually united into Roman religion.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrosch, Studien u. Andeut., p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

The Titii were restored under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], but their functions were changed to conduct the worship of an [[Roman Emperor|emperor]], like those of [[Sodales Augustales]].

{{Nerva–Antonine dynasty}}
'''Vibia Sabina''' (83–136/137) was a [[Roman Empress]], wife and second cousin once removed to [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]]. She was the daughter of [[Salonia Matidia|Matidia]] (niece of Roman Emperor [[Trajan]]) and [[suffect consul]] [[Lucius Vibius Sabinus]]. After her father's death in 84, Sabina, along with her half-sister [[Matidia Minor]], went to live with their mother's mother, [[Ulpia Marciana|Marciana]]. They were raised in the household of Trajan and his wife [[Pompeia Plotina|Plotina]].

Sabina married Hadrian in 100, at the empress Plotina's request. Hadrian succeeded her great uncle in 117. Sabina's mother Matidia (Hadrian's second cousin) was also fond of Hadrian and allowed him to marry her daughter.

==Suetonius==
Sabina is rumored to have had an affair with [[Suetonius]], a historian who was Hadrian's secretary, in the year 119,&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustan History|''Historia Augusta'']] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html#11.3 11.3]&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in his dismissal as the Emperor's secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Suetonius Tranquillus, Gaius|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, her husband was thought to be more sexually interested in his favourite [[Antinous]] and other male lovers, and he and Sabina had no children. In 128, she was awarded the title of [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]. Vibia Sabina died before her husband, some time in 136 or early 137.&lt;ref&gt;Opper, Thorsten. ''Hadrian: Empire and Conflict'', Harvard University Press, 2008, p. 205. {{ISBN|0-674-03095-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hadrian's stone elegy for his wife "depicts the apotheosis, or divine ascent of Sabina in accordance with her posthumous deification on the order of Hadrian."&lt;ref&gt;Annelise Freisenbruch, ''Caesars’ Wives: Sex, Power, and Politics in the Roman Empire'' (London and New York: Free Press, 2010), 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vibia Aurelia Sabina]] (170-died before 217), daughter and youngest child of Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] and Roman Empress [[Faustina the Younger]] was a great-greatniece to Vibia Sabina. Her name was bestowed in honor of Sabina and her father.

'''Wenchang Wang''' ({{zh|c=文昌王}}), also known as '''Wenchang Dijun''' ({{zh|c=文昌帝君|labels=no}}), is a Taoist deity in [[Chinese Mythology]], known as the God of Culture and Literature.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, ETC "Myths and Legends of CHINA" Gearge G. Harrap &amp; Co. LTD. 1922 p.104&lt;/ref&gt; He is also at times referred to simply as Wen Qu, or Wen. The literal translation of his name would be King ({{zh|c=王|labels=no}}) of Flourishing ({{zh|c=昌|labels=no}}) Culture/Language ({{zh|c=文|labels=no}}). Wenchang Wang is physically represented by a constellation of six stars near the [[Big Dipper]]. The stars all had names of their own: Shangjiang ({{zh|c=上將|labels=no}}), Cijiang ({{zh|c=次將|labels=no}}), Guixiang ({{zh|c=貴相|labels=no}}), [[Siming (deity)|Siming]] ({{zh|c=司命|labels=no}}), Sizhong ({{zh|c=司中|labels=no}}), and Silu ({{zh|c=司祿|labels=no}}). Wenchang Wang is often depicted as an elderly scholar accompanied by two attendants,  Tianlong ({{zh|c=天聾|labels=no}} or Heaven-Deaf) and Diya ({{zh|c=地啞|labels=no}} or Earth-Mute).&lt;ref&gt;Christie, Anthony. Chinese Mythology. Hamlyn House, 1968 p.56&lt;/ref&gt; He has historically been called upon by scholars and writers who need inspiration or help right before an exam.&lt;ref name="baidu1"&gt;{{cite web|author=2016-10-07 |url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/121974.htm |title=文昌帝君_百度百科 |website=Baike.baidu.com |date=2016-10-07 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story ==
There are quite a few accounts of Wenchang Wang; most depict him as a man by the name Zhang Yazi ({{zh|c=張亞子|labels=no}}), of a county in [[Sichuan]] Province called [[Zitong County|Zitong]]. A particular account cites him as a war hero, having died an honorable death in a rebellion against Emperor [[Fú Jiān]] in 374. Other accounts of Wenchang Wang appear rather sporadically at different time periods; he has been given seventeen reincarnations over a period of 3,000 years. A notable account of an appearance of Wenchang Wang was as the Spirit of Zitong, during the suppression of a rebellion in [[Chengdu]], Sichuan, in 1000 A.D. A man allegedly climbed a ladder in midst of battle and declared that the Spirit of Zitong told him the "town [of rebels] would fall on the twentieth day of the ninth moon." The town fell on the day indicated, and the general in charge of repressing the rebellion had the temple repaired.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, ETC “Myths and Legends of CHINA” Gearge G. Harrap &amp; Co. LTD. 1922 p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being a respected warrior, Wenchang Wang was well respected as a model for filiality. The ''Book of Emperor Zi Tong'' records: "Wenchang was had a mature mind at birth. His mother breastfed him even though she was perilously ill and malnourished. In the middle of the night, Wenchang cut flesh from his own thighs and fed it to his mother. She was then cured of her illness."

Wenchang Wang also appears in other texts, where he is praised for other noble virtues. The book ''Wenchang Emperor and the States He Stabilized'' states: "He descended into the mortal world seventy-three times as a ''shidafu''" (a scholar-bureaucrat position in the emperor's government of feudal China). Wenchang was uncorrupted, upright and just, and never dealt out harsh punishments to the people. He allegedly helps people when they have hardships, saves those who are in trouble, has compassion for the lonely, forgives people's mistakes, and leaves peace and stability everywhere he goes. Because of this, the [[Jade Emperor]] put him in charge of the elections of village leaders.&lt;ref name="baidu1"/&gt;

== Controversy ==
There is controversy over the actual position of Wenchang, despite common practice of attributing him to Zhang Yazi. Many point out that the stories on Zhang Yazi are attributed mainly to honor and heroism, having nothing to do with actual literature. In his ''Myths and Legends of China'', E.T.C. Werner points out that "Wherever Wenchang is worshiped there will also be found a separate representation of [[K'uei Hsing]] [Kui Xing], showing that while the official deity has been allowed to 'borrow glory' from the popular god, and even to assume his personality, the independent existence of the stellar spirit is nevertheless sedulously maintained." The story being that Zhang Kui (Kui Xing) was a brilliant scholar who was, because of his unsightly face, not recognized by the Emperor when he passed the top examinations. Feeling dejected, he threw himself into the ocean, and ascended into the heavens as a star. Initially, scholars worshiped this star, Kui Xing, as the God of Literature, but with time, he was eventually linked to the Dipper (constellation) or Great Bear, and assimilated into Wenchang Jundi.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, ETC “Myths and Legends of CHINA” Gearge G. Harrap &amp; Co. LTD. 1922 p.106-107&lt;/ref&gt;

Wenchang has had various titles, but was officially apotheosized by Yen Yu of the Mongol Dynasty in 1314 A.D as the Supporter of the Yuan (Mongol) Dynasty, Diffuser of Renovating Influences, Ssu-lu of Wenchang, God and Lord.

He is often called upon by scholars and students for academic help. There are many different temples and shrines dedicated to worshiping Wenchang Wang, the most notable being the Wenchang temple of Zitong, located at modern-day Qiqu Mountain ({{zh|c=七曲山|labels=no}}). This famous mountain is both the location of the largest cypress forest in China as well as the origin of the Wenchang culture. As Sichuan (where Qiqu Mountain is located) is mainly in the south, there is a saying, "In the North there is Confucius and in the South there is Wenchang."&lt;ref&gt;[http://iask.sina.com.cn/search_engine/snapshot.php?key=%CE%C4%B2%FD%B5%DB%BE%FD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwenwen.soso.com%2Fz%2Fq92163477.htm&amp;snapid=310893215&amp;snap=%CE%C4%B2%FD%2F%B5%DB%2F%BE%FD] {{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also two notable temples dedicated to worshiping Wenchang Di Jun in Taichung: [[Temples of Taichung#Wen Chang Temple 2|one]] is in the [[Beitun District|Beitun]] District of [[Taichung]], apparently constructed in 1863 as a means of facilitating learning in the developing groups of people there.  The [[Temples of Taichung#Wen Chang Temple|other]] temple is in the [[Nantun District|Nantun]] district of Taichung, built in 1825. Both temples face south, which is apparently due to a principle of [[feng shui]].

The practice of worshiping Wenchang Wang has a long history; it was popular in the past because he was allowed to be venerated by the rich and poor alike. He is still often worshiped now for essentially the same reasons. The third day of the second moon of the Chinese lunar calendar is the birthday of Wenchang. People generally celebrated his birthday by visiting his temples, the officials and scholars of the county all had to go to the Temple of Wenchang to make offerings, sacrifices or recite poems.

'''Yibbum''' ({{IPA-he|jibum|pron}}) or [[levirate marriage]] in [[Judaism]], is one of the most complex [[types of marriages]] mandated by [[Torah]] law ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:5-10| Yibbumo }}) by which, according to the law, the brother of a man who died without children has an obligation to marry the widow. However, if either of the parties refuses to go through with the marriage, both are required to go through a ceremony known as ''[[halizah]]'', involving a symbolic act of renunciation of their right to perform this marriage. Jewish law (''[[halakha]]'') has seen a gradual decline of ''yibbum'' in favor of ''halizah'', to the point where in most contemporary Jewish communities, and in Israel by mandate of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbinate]], the former is prohibited.

The concept of ''yibbum'' is not unique to Judaism. Known as [[levirate marriage]] (when the marriage is to the deceased's brother) or [[widow inheritance]] (when it is to any surviving male relative), it has been practiced by other societies with a strong [[clan]] structure. It is or was known in societies including the [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], [[Jat people|Jat]]s, [[Huns]], [[Mongol]]s, and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s.

==In the Hebrew Bible==
{{Quote_box|
 width=15%
|align=left
|quote=When brothers live together, and one of them dies childless, the dead man's wife shall not be allowed to marry an outsider. Her husband's brother must cohabit with her, making her his wife, and thus performing a brother-in-law's duty to her. The first-born son whom she bears will then perpetuate the name of the dead brother, so that his name will not be obliterated from Israel.
|source=&lt;span style="float:right;"&gt;-- {{bibleverse-lb||Deuteronomy|25:5-6|HE}}&lt;/span&gt;
|}}

[[Image:Rembrandt's school Tamar.JPG|thumb|300px|Judah and Tamar, by [[Rembrandt]] (1650s). An early example of a Yibbum-like practice is the biblical story of Judah and Tamar.]]
Sexual interactions by a man with his brother's wife are forbidden by the [[Torah]] ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:16|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|20:21|HE}}), but for the case of "yibbum", Torah provides a clearer picture of what is acceptable and intended for protection.  The surviving brother is given a choice to take his responsibility as a [[goel]] by fulfilling the yibbum obligation, or to perform ''[[halizah]]'', though the latter choice is described by the verse disfavorably. The brother who agreed to marry his sister-in-law would be the sole benefactor of his brother's estate instead of splitting it with the family. The offspring of the levirate union would be seen as a perpetuation of the deceased brother's name. Levirate marriage is permissible only when the dead brother had no children at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]] ''Laws of Yibbum and Halizah'' 1:3; [[Shulchan Aruch]], Eben ha-'Ezer, 156:2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the stated intent of the levirate law as expressed in Deuteronomy is to provide an heir so that the deceased brother's name "will not be obliterated from Israel" ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:6|HE}}), such laws effectively provided protection for widows as well. At the time the Torah was written, if a woman did not have a husband because of widowhood, she had no one to provide for her any longer and she would be disgraced, if not likely die of starvation.{{fact|date=April 2016}} Children were also a means of continued provision, since they are commanded to care and show respect for the elderly as they move further along in years. A childless widow was without both means of provision. Although quite contrary to our modern day dilemmas, even becoming a second wife to a brother-in-law, as indicated in Deuteronomy 25:5-10, was better than living on the streets at the mercy of those around her. Under Torah, men had a responsibility to the women around them, which included life-sustaining provisions (i.e. food, shelter, and comfort). Those of honor were beholden to their responsibility to protect the defenseless.

The most famous case of a levirate-type marriage in the [[Hebrew Bible]] is the unusual union of [[Judah (biblical figure)|Judah]] and his daughter-in-law [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] found in {{bibleverse||Genesis|38:8|HE}}. The case is not strictly a case of ''yibbum'' as Judah was Tamar's father-in-law, and also the case pre-dates the biblical obligation. It may be a reflection of contemporary Middle East practices.

Religion professor [[Tikva Frymer-Kensky]] has pointed out the economic implications of a Hebrew levirate marriage: the first child born to the brother's widow would be deemed the heir of the deceased brother, and able to claim the deceased brother's share of inheritance. If the deceased brother was the firstborn son, his inheritance was a double share. However, if the deceased brother were childless, the living brother would be entitled to inherit an increased share; or if he is the oldest surviving son he would be entitled to a double share of the increased share.&lt;ref name=Frymer&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/tamar-bible Frymer-Kensky, Tikva. "Tamar: Bible", ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia''. 20 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive. (Viewed on August 6, 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of an analogous arrangement to ''yibbum'' is recounted in the [[Book of Ruth]]. After the death of her husband, [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] is noticed and welcomed by her husband's kinsman, [[Boaz]]. After Ruth is rejected by an anonymous ''Ploni Almoni'' who performs ''halizah'', Boaz marries her. In this case as well, the kin in question would not have been subject to the biblical levirate marriage obligation, as neither Ploni Almoni nor Boaz were brothers of Ruth's late husband.

''[[Halakha]]'' (Jewish law) has a rich tradition around ''yibbum''. These laws were first recorded in the [[Mishna]] and [[Talmud]] in [[Yevamot]], and were later codified by [[Maimonides]] in the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''. The subject is considered one of the most intricate in Jewish law, partly because of the complication that arise from multiple brothers and multiple wives. ''Yibbum'' is an exception to the biblical prohibition for a man to have sexual relations with "his brother's wife" found for example in {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:8-16|HE}}. (See [[Incest in the Bible]].)

===When yibbum applies===
According to ''halakha'', when a married man dies without having any children, male or female, from any relationship (including pre-marital and extra-marital), his widow and his brother must perform either ''yibbum'' or ''[[halizah]]''. For the laws of ''yibbum'' only brothers that share a common father are considered brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]], Eben ha-'Ezer, 157:1; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Laws of Yibbum and Halizah'' 1:8&lt;/ref&gt; In order for yibbum to apply, all of the following conditions must be met:
# The brothers share a common father &lt;ref name=17b&gt;Talmud Yevamot 17b&lt;/ref&gt;
# The dead brother had no surviving children, male or female, from any relationship,&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yevamot 22a&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of his death &lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yevamot 87b&lt;/ref&gt;
# The brother performing yibbum was born before his brother's death &lt;ref name=17b/&gt;
# The brother performing yibbum is not [[arayot|forbidden]], other than by her marriage to the dead brother, to marry ''any'' of his dead brother's widows (e.g. if any of them is his daughter, yibbum does not apply to him at all) &lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yevamot 2,3&lt;/ref&gt;
# The brother performing yibbum is physically capable of fathering children &lt;ref name=24a/&gt;
# The widow is physically capable of bearing children&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yevamot 12a&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Anders Zorn-The Widow.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Widow'' (1882-83) by [[Anders Zorn]]. The widow has to remain unmarried until ''yibbum'' or ''halizah'' has been performed.]]
Even if some of the brothers do not meet all the conditions to be eligible for yibbum, as long as there is one that does, yibbum applies to him. If there is no brother who meets all of the conditions, neither yibbum nor halitzah applies,&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yevamot 3a&lt;/ref&gt; except if the widow is forbidden to marry the brother as a result of a prohibition not involving the punishment of [[kares]] (spiritual exicision){{clarify|date=January 2011}}, in which case halitzah would apply.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yevamot 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restrictions related to yibbum===
It is forbidden for any of the widows to remarry until ''yibbum'' or ''halizah'' has been performed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]] ''Laws of Yibbum and Halizah'' 1:2&lt;/ref&gt; If the deceased left multiple wives ''yibbum'' may only be performed with one of them, at which time the remaining wives are permitted to remarry. Likewise, if yibbum is not performed, ''halizah'' is only performed with one of the widows,&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yevamot 44a&lt;/ref&gt; after which all of them may remarry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]], Eben ha-'Ezer, 161:1; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Laws of Yibbum and Halizah'' 1:9&lt;/ref&gt;

If all surviving brothers are still children, the widow must wait until one reaches [[B'nai Mitzvah|halachic adulthood]], at which time he can perform yibbum or  ''halizah''. Similarly, if the brother is missing, the woman is required to wait until he is located. This can lead to a situation similar to an ''[[agunah]]''.

===How yibbum is performed===
According to Biblical law, there is no need for a marriage ceremony between the widow and the deceased's brother as they are already bound by divine decree,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]] ''Laws of Yibbum and Halizah'' 1:1&lt;/ref&gt; thus, they need only cohabit to perform yibbum. Nevertheless, the Sages decreed that the couple perform a marriage-like [[Erusin|ceremony]] called ''maamar'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]] ''Laws of Yibbum and Halizah'' 2:1&lt;/ref&gt; recite the marriage blessings (''[[sheva brachot]]'') and write a  prenuptial agreement (''[[ketubah]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]], Eben ha-'Ezer, 166:2; [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Laws of Yibbum and Halizah'' 2:2&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one brother may perform yibbum. The oldest brother is given preference, but if he refuses, any brother can perform ''yibbum'', and if a brother performed yibbum out of turn, it is nevertheless valid.&lt;ref name=24a&gt;Talmud Yevamot 24a&lt;/ref&gt; After one brother performs yibbum or halizah, none of the brothers may marry any of the other widows.

===Other laws===
[[Image:Historic New Zealand Ketuba or Yibbum (marriage contract).jpg|thumb|200px|19th century Ketuba or Yibbum from New Zealand, including a promise to take care of the bride if the husband dies before any children are born.]]
Because there is a general prohibition on a man marrying his brother's wife, anytime that a ''yibbum'' is not required (for example the deceased had a child) it is forbidden. 
Likewise, anytime that there is a doubt whether ''yibbum'' is required, it is also forbidden and ''halizah'' is required.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]] ''Laws of Yibbum and Halizah'' 6:4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Samaritans]] followed a slightly different course, which may indicate an earlier custom among the Hebrews; the former practiced the levirate only when the woman was betrothed and the marriage had not been consummated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] Kiddushin 65b&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]] appear to have followed the same practice, and [[Benjamin Nahawendi]], as well as [[Elijah Bashyazi]], favored it.&lt;ref&gt;Adderet Eliyahu, "Nashim," p. 93a&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The rabbis in the time of the ''[[mishnah]]'' added formal marriage requirements such as a ''[[ketubah]]'' (marriage contract), but over the centuries ''yibbum'' waned in favor.

By Talmudic times the practice of levirate marriage was deemed secondary in preference to halizah by some of the rabbis, because of the brother's questionable intentions;&lt;ref&gt;Talmud [[Bekhorot]] 13a&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, to marry a brother's widow for her beauty was regarded by Abba Saul as equivalent to incest.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yevamot 39b&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bar Kappara]] also recommends halizah.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yevamot 109a&lt;/ref&gt; A difference of opinion appears among the later authorities, with [[Isaac Alfasi]], [[Maimonides]], and the Spanish school generally upholding the custom, while [[Rabbeinu Tam]] and the Northern school prefer ''halizah.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]], Eben ha-'Ezer, 165&lt;/ref&gt; A change of religion on the part of the surviving brother does not affect the obligation of the levirate, or its alternative, the halizah.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac ben Sheshet]], Responsa, i. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, if the surviving brother is married, Ashkenazim, who follow the ''takkanah'' of [[Gershom ben Judah]] abolishing [[polygamy]], would be compelled to perform halizah.

[[Orthodox Jews]] in modern times have generally upheld the position of Rabbeinu Tam and perform halizah rather than yibbum. [[Conservative Judaism]] formally retains it. [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] have abolished it.

==Social consequences==
The rules may create social problems in some situations, especially for the widow. For example, among observant Jews, if the brother on whom the ''yibbum'' obligation falls is too young to marry, the widow would need to wait until the brother reaches marriage age or the age at which he may opt out of the marriage. The widow would not know if the brother would even opt out of the marriage. Furthermore, in either event, by that stage the widow may be past her child-bearing age, and still be subject to the possible obligation to marry the brother. Also, there is no time limit on the indication of the brother's intention as to whether he will proceed with the marriage or opt out, and the brother may already be married.

[[File:Yemoja Nigeria.jpg|thumb|A '''[[Yemoja]]''' devotee in Nigeria]]
The '''Yoruba religion''' comprises the traditional religious and spiritual concepts and practices of the [[Yoruba people]]. Its homeland is in present-day Southwestern [[Nigeria]] and the adjoining parts of [[Benin]] and [[Togo]], commonly known as [[Yorubaland]]. Yoruba religion is formed of diverse traditions. It has influenced a host of thriving traditions such as [[Santería]], [[Umbanda]], [[Trinidad Orisha]], and [[Candomblé]].&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;{{cite book|title= Yoruba Culture: A Philosophical Accountfirst=Kola|last=Abimbola|edition=Paperback|publisher= Iroko Academics Publishers|year= 2005|isbn=1-905388-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoruba religious beliefs are part of Itan, the total complex of songs, histories, stories, and other cultural concepts which make up the Yoruba society.&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YRM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion"/&gt;

==Beliefs==
[[File:Yoruba divination board.jpg|thumb|Yoruba divination board '''[[Opon Ifá]]''']]
According to Kola Abimbola, the Yoruba have evolved a robust cosmology.&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt; In brief, it holds that all human beings possess what is known as "Ayanmo"&lt;ref name="Fate"&gt;{{cite book|title=Àyànmọ|first=Afọlabi|last=Ọlabimtan|location=Lagos, Nigeria|publisher=Macmillan|year= 1973|oclc=33249752}}&lt;/ref&gt; (destiny, fate) and are expected to eventually become one in spirit with Olodumare ([[Olorun]], the divine creator and source of all energy). Furthermore, the thoughts and actions of each person in Ayé (the physical realm) interact with all other living things, including the Earth itself.&lt;ref name="YRM"&gt;{{cite book|first=Afọlabi|last=Ọlabimtan|oclc=33249752|others=Translated by George E. Simpson|title=Yoruba Religion and Medicine in Ibadan|publisher= Ibadan University Press|year= 1991|isbn=978-121-068-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each person attempts to achieve transcendence and find their destiny in Orun-Rere (the spiritual realm of those who do good and beneficial things).   

One's ori-inu (spiritual consciousness in the physical realm) must grow in order to consummate union with one's "Iponri" (Ori Orun, spiritual self).&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt;

Those who stop growing spiritually, in any of their given lives, are destined for "Orun-Apadi" (the invisible realm of potsherds). Life and death are said to be cycles of existence in a series of physical bodies while one's spirit evolves toward transcendence. This evolution is said to be most evident amongst the [[Orisha]]s, the divine viziers of [[Olorun]].

Iwapẹlẹ (or well-balanced) meditative recitation and sincere veneration is sufficient to strengthen the ori-inu of most people.&lt;ref name="YRM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt; Well-balanced people, it is believed, are able to make positive use of the simplest form of connection between their [[Ori (Yoruba)|Ori]]s and the omnipotent Olu-Orun: an adura (petition or prayer) for divine support.

Prayer to one's Ori Orun produces an immediate sensation of joy. Elegbara (Eshu, not the divine messenger but accuser of the righteous) initiates contact with spiritual realm (not heavenly places) on behalf of the petitioner, and transmits the prayer to Ayé; the deliverer of [[ase (Yoruba)|ase]] or ''the spark of life''. He transmits this prayer without distorting it in any way. Thereafter, the petitioner may be satisfied with a personal answer. In the event that he or she is not, the [[Ifá]] oracle of the [[Orisha]] [[Orunmila]] may also be consulted. All communication with Orun, whether simplistic in the form of a personal prayer or complicated in the form of that done by an initiated [[Babalawo]] (priest of divination), however, is energized by invoking ase.

In the Yoruba belief system, Olodumare has ase over all that is. Hence, Is considered supreme.&lt;ref name="YRM"/&gt;

===Olodumare===
{{Main|Olodumare}}
[[Olodumare]] is the most important "state of existence".&lt;ref name="God"/&gt; Regarded as being all-encompassing, no gender can be assigned. Hence, it is common to hear references to "it" or "they" (although this is meant to address a somewhat singularity). "They" are the owner of all heads, for during human creation, Olodumare gave "emi" (the breath of life) to humankind. In this, Olodumare is Supreme.&lt;ref name="God"&gt;{{cite book|title= Olódùmarè: God in Yoruba Belief|author=[[Bolaji Idowu]]|location=Ikeja, Nigeria|publisher=Longman|year= 1982|isbn=0-582-60803-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps one of the most important human endeavors extolled within the Yoruba literary corpus is the quest to improve one's "Iwa" (character, behaviour). In this way the teachings transcends religious doctrine, advising as it does that a person must also improve his civic, social and intellectual spheres of being; every stanza of the sacred [[Ifá]] oracular poetry ([[Odu Ifa]]) has a portion covering the importance of "Iwa". Central to this is the theme of righteousness, both individual and collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifaspeaks.blogspot.com/2011/02/odu-ifa-iwori-meji-ifa-speaks-on.html|title=Odù-Ifá Iwòrì Méjì; Ifá speaks on Righteousness|author=Ifaloju|publisher=S.S. Popoola, Ifa Dida, Library, INC|date=February 2011|accessdate=8 April 2012|website=Ifa Speaks...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation===
The Yoruba regard [[Olodumare]] as the principal agent of creation.

According to a Yoruba account of [[creation myth|creation]], during a certain stage in this process, the "truth" was sent to confirm the habitability of the newly formed planets. The [[earth]] being one of these was visited but deemed too wet for conventional life.

After a successful period of time, a number of divinities led by [[Obatala]] were sent to accomplish the task of helping earth develop its crust. On one of their visits to the realm, the arch-divinity Obatala took to the stage equipped with a [[mollusk]] that concealed some form of [[soil]]; winged beasts and some cloth like material. The contents were emptied onto what soon became a large mound on the surface of the water and soon after, the winged-beasts began to scatter this around until the point where it gradually made into a large patch of dry land; the various indentations they created eventually becoming hills and valleys.&lt;ref name="God"/&gt;

Obatala leaped onto a high-ground and named the place [[Ife]]. The land became fertile and plant life began to flourish. From handfuls of earth he began to mold figurines. Meanwhile, as this was happening on earth, Olodumare gathered the gasses from the far reaches of space and sparked an explosion that shaped into a fireball. He subsequently sent it to Ife, where it dried much of the land and simultaneously began to bake the motionless figurines. It was at this point that Olodumare released the "breath of life" to blow across the land, and the figurines slowly came into "being" as the first people of Ife.&lt;ref name="God"/&gt;

For this reason, Ife is locally referred to as "Ife Oodaye" - "cradle of existence".&lt;ref name="God"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|2009}} – entry {{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t279.e319|title=Yoruba|accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orisha===
{{Main|Orisha}}
An [[Orisha]] (spelled Òrìṣa) is an entity that possesses the capability of reflecting some of the manifestations of Olodumare. Yoruba ''Orishas'' (commonly translated "unique/special/selected heads") are often described as intermediaries between humankind and the supernatural. The term is also translated as "Deities" or "Divinities" or "Gods".&lt;ref&gt;Cf.[http://organizations.uncfsu.edu/ncrsa/journal/v03/johnsonoyinade_yoruba.htm The Concept of God: The People of Yoruba] for the acceptability of the translation&lt;/ref&gt;

Orisha(s) are revered for having control over specific elements by nature, thus being better referred to as the [[divinities]] or ''Imole''. Even so, there are those of their number that are more akin to ancient heroes and/or [[Philosopher|sage]]s.&lt;ref name="Religion"/&gt; These are best addressed as [[Dema Deity|Dema Deities]]. Even though the term Orisha is often used to describe both classes of divine [[Entity|entities]], it is properly reserved for the former one.&lt;ref name="Religion"/&gt;

He is said to assist in enhancing the power derived from herbal medicines and other forms of esoteric technology.

Eshu is the Orisha of chance, accident and unpredictability. Because he is Olorun's linguist and the master of languages, Eshu is responsible for carrying messages and sacrifices from humans to the Sky God. Also known for his phallic powers and exploits. Eshu is said to lurk at gateways, on the highways and at the crossroads, where he introduces chance and accident into the lives of humans.

===Irunmole===
Irunmole are entities sent by [[Olorun]] to complete given tasks, often acting as liaisons between Orun (the invisible realm) and Aiye (the physical realm).&lt;ref name="Religion"&gt;J. Olumide Lucas, ''The Religion of the Yorubas'', Athelia Henrietta PR, 1996. {{ISBN|0-9638787-8-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irunmole(s) can best be described as ranking divinities; whereby such divinities are regarded as the principal Orishas. Irunmole, from "Erinrun" - 400, "Imole" - Divinites or Divine Spirits

==Reincarnation==
[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Egungun masquerade dance garment.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Egungun]] masquerade dance garment in the permanent collection of [[The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis]]]]
The Yoruba believe in Atunwa, [[reincarnation]] within the family. The names Babatunde (father returns), Yetunde (Mother returns), Babatunji (Father wakes once again) and Sotunde (The wise man returns) all offer vivid evidence of the Ifa concept of familial or lineal rebirth. There is no simple guarantee that your grandfather or great uncle will "come back" in the birth of your child, however.

Whenever the time arrives for a spirit to return to Earth (otherwise known as The Marketplace) through the conception of a new life in the direct bloodline of the family, one of the component entities of a person's being returns, while the other remains in Heaven (Ikole Orun). The spirit that returns does so in the form of a Guardian Ori. One's Guardian Ori, which is represented and contained in the crown of the head, represents not only the spirit and energy of one's previous blood relative, but the accumulated wisdom he or she has acquired through myriad lifetimes. This is not to be confused with one’s spiritual Ori, which contains personal destiny, but instead refers to the coming back to ''The Marketplace'' of one's personal blood Ori through one's new life and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Way of the Orisa|edition=1st|last1=Neimark|first1=Philip John|publisher=HarperOne |date=28 May 1993 |isbn=978-0-06-250557-6|url=http://www.spiritualtools.org/The-Way-of-the-Orisa-p110.html|accessdate=2012-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Primary Ancestor (which should be identified in your Itefa) becomes – if you are aware and work with that specific energy – a “guide” for the individual throughout their lifetime. At the end of that life they return to their identical spirit self and merge into one, taking the additional knowledge gained from their experience with the individual as a form of ''payment''.

==Yoruba religion around the world==
{{Main|Yoruba history}}
According to Professor S. A. Akintoye, the Yoruba were exquisite statesmen who spread across the globe in an unprecedented fashion;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of the Yoruba people|first=Prof S. A.|last= Akintoye|publisher=Amalion Publishing|year= 2010|isbn=2-35926-005-7|id= {{ASIN|2359260057|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; the reach of their culture is largely due to migration—the most recent migration occurred with the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. During this period, many Yoruba were captured and sold into the slave trade and transported to [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]], [[Colombia]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[St. Vincent &amp; The Grenadines]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], and other parts of the Americas. With them, they carried their religious beliefs.

===Relationship and influence on Voodoo===
The [[West African Vodun|Vodun]] faith, which originated amongst a different ethnic group (the [[Gbe languages|Gbe speaking]] peoples of present-day [[Benin]], [[Togo]], and [[Ghana]]), holds influential aspects on the [[African diaspora]] in countries such as [[Haiti]] and [[Cuba]], also Southern States like [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Amalgamation with other religions==
{{anchor|Chrislam}}
"Chrislam" is a neologism used to refer to [[Religious syncretism|syncretism]] between [[Christianity in Nigeria|Christianity]] and [[Islam in Nigeria|Islam]] among the  [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of [[Nigeria]], mentioned by Greenfield (2001) as an example of the "Yoruba genius for syncretism".
&lt;ref&gt;The term is mentioned by {{cite book|last1=Greenfield|first1=Sidney|title=Reinventing Religions: Syncretism and Transformation in Africa and the Americas|date=2001|pages=52, 53}} (note 21)&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoruba "Chrislam" includes two distinct religious movements, one called ''Ifeoluwa'' founded by Tela Tella in the 1970s and 80s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nai.uu.se/ecas-4/panels/101-120/panel-115/Marloes-Janson-full-paper.pdf. Marloes, Janson. ''Chrislam’s Healing School in Lagos.''] p. 3, footnote 4.{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another called ''Oke-Tude'' founded by Samson Saka in 1999. They are also known as ''The Will of God Mission'' or ''The True Message of God Mission'' respectively.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0126/p01s04-woaf.html|title=In Africa, Islam and Christianity are growing - and blending|last=McLaughlin|first=Abraham|website=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=January 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adherence to "Chrislam" in Nigeria is very limited; Soares (2009) notes that "such efforts towards religious fusion or synthesis seem to be rather exceptional and increasingly so. In many places there has been intense competition and higher levels of tension within and between different confessional groups."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Soares, "An Islamic social movement in contemporary West Africa: NASFAT of Nigeria"in : Stephen  Ellis and  Ineke Van Kessel (eds.) ''Movers and Shakers: Social Movements in Africa'' (2009), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

''{{lang|yo|Ifeoluwa}}'' ("Love of God")  recognises both the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]] as [[Religious text|holy texts]], and  practices "running deliverance," a distinctive practice of spiritual running likened to [[Joshua]]'s army circling [[Battle of Jericho|Jericho]], or the practice of Pilgrims [[Circumambulation|circumambulating]] a Church for Palm Sunday or the [[Kaaba]], and Jews around the Synagogue during Sukkot. In contrast to other Chrislamic sects, Tela Tella, while claiming to believe in both the Qur'an and the Bible, says they are incomplete, and is [[Neo-revelationism|writing his own book]] called the "Ifeoluwa Book".&lt;ref name="test 4" /&gt; Tela Tella claims that an angel of God came to him and told him that he gave him the mission and the name "Ifeoluwa: The Will of God Mission".&lt;ref name="test 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egodiuchendu.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=65:chrislam-forging-ties-in-a-multi-religious-society&amp;catid=5:papers&amp;Itemid=11|title=Chrislam: Forging Ties in a Multi-Religious Society|work=egodiuchendu.com|access-date=2016-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920111244/http://www.egodiuchendu.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=65:chrislam-forging-ties-in-a-multi-religious-society&amp;catid=5:papers&amp;Itemid=11|archive-date=2016-09-20|dead-url=yes|df=}} (New Scientist Magazine, June 17, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Oke Tude (Oketude) in Ogudu (a northern suburb of [[Lagos]]), founded  by Samson Saka in 1999, is slightly less recognisable to mainstream Christianity, resembling more interfaith worship with three different sessions or services that take place on Sunday. The first is a Muslim session, then a Christian session, and finally there is a joint session that Saka leads. During this he stresses the similarities between Christianity and Islamic beliefs.&lt;ref name="test 4" /&gt;

In the 1949 documentary ''Fiestas de Santiago Apóstol en Loíza Aldea'', anthropologist [[Ricardo Alegría]] noted a similar tendency at [[Loíza, Puerto Rico]], arguing that the affinity between the black population in the municipality and the Catholic saint [[James, son of Zebedee|Santiago Apóstol]] may derive from the way in which he is depicted as a warrior; a similar theme to some depictions of Shango.&lt;ref name="Hernández125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hernández|2002|pp=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory supposed that this resemblance was used by the population as a covert form to honor their ancestral deity.
