'''Berlin Raceway''' is a 0.4375 mile long paved oval race track in [[Marne, Michigan]], near [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. It opened in 1950. It was originally a horse track before [[World War II]]. The track is notable for the lack of an outside wall on the back straightaway, a unique feature for a national series such as [[Auto Racing Club of America|ARCA]]. In addition, the short straights make it feel almost circular. Berlin's current track record is 12.513 seconds, set by Brian Gerster in 2018 in a winged sprint car.

Berlin Raceway takes its name from the city of Marne's original name "Berlin," which was changed due to Anti-German sentiment following [[World War I]].

'''Cameron Hall''' is a 5,029–seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]]. It was built in 1981 and is home to the [[Virginia Military Institute]] [[VMI Keydets basketball|Keydets]] basketball team.&lt;ref name="vmi"&gt;June 11, 2008. [https://admin.xosn.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=9800&amp;ATCLID=1357390 Cameron Hall - The Home of VMI Basketball] Retrieved July 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Although mainly used for basketball, the arena also holds VMI's commencement every May, as well as other large-scale events. It was named after brothers Bruce and Daniel Cameron, VMI Class of 1938 and 1942, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmi.edu/content.aspx?id=12221 Cameron Scholarships]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Built in 1981, Cameron Hall was named after brothers Bruce B. Cameron, Jr. and Daniel D. Cameron from [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;October 30, 1981. [http://digitalcollections.vmi.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15821coll1/id/2944 "Institute Report: October 30, 1981."] Retrieved July 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cameron brothers were both graduates of the school, as Bruce graduated in 1938 and Daniel in 1942. They paid for $2.3 million of the building's $6.8 million cost, with a supplementation from the [[Virginia General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="cadet"&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Hearne|date=November 13, 1981|title=Athletic Arena Opens|url=http://www2.vmi.edu/thecadet/pdfs-hi/1981/The-Cadet_1981-11-13.pdf|deadurl=yes|newspaper=[[The Cadet (newspaper)|The Cadet]]|location=[[Lexington, VA]]|publisher=Virginia Military Institute|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143113/http://www2.vmi.edu/thecadet/pdfs-hi/1981/The-Cadet_1981-11-13.pdf#|archivedate=2014-07-14|accessdate=July 12, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other funds were paid for by the VMI Foundation. For their contributions, the Cameron brothers were given life passes to all Cameron Hall events by VMI Board of Visitors president Vincent J. Thomas.&lt;ref name="cadet" /&gt; The first game was played on December 5, 1981, between [[VMI Keydets basketball|VMI]] and the [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia Cavaliers]]. Virginia won the game 76–49 before 4,460 fans, which is currently the fifth-largest crowd in the arena's history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmikeydets.com/pdf9/2560532.pdf?ATCLID=209295912&amp;SPSID=43813&amp;SPID=3897&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=9800 2013–14 VMI Basketball Fact Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue seats 5,029 spectators for basketball, and 4,300 for plays and concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Theodore|date=September 25, 1981|title=Cameron Hall|url=http://www2.vmi.edu/thecadet/pdfs-hi/1981/The-Cadet_1981-09-25.pdf|newspaper=[[The Cadet (newspaper)|The Cadet]]|location=Lexington, VA|publisher=Virginia Military Institute|accessdate=July 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714132235/http://www2.vmi.edu/thecadet/pdfs-hi/1981/The-Cadet_1981-09-25.pdf#|archive-date=2014-07-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went largely untouched until 1995, when it received an extensive face lift that included repainted walls and portals, new railings, and a new floor color scheme.&lt;ref name="vmi" /&gt; Locker rooms were also renovated, with new carpeting, paint, and a lounge. Four years later in 1999, a VMI "Wall of Fame" was added to the mezzanine level, which features photographs and trophies as a tribute to former VMI basketball players and members of the VMI Sports Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="vmi" /&gt;

In 2007, VMI installed a new court donated by Ralph Costen, a 1970 graduate of the school. It was the first new floor since the 1995 renovation, and was appropriately named "Costen Court".

==Features==
Cameron Hall serves as host to the VMI athletic department offices, and contains a library, reception area, and five racquetball courts open to cadets in the basement level.&lt;ref name="vmi" /&gt; Recently, electronic side screens were added on the sidelines, as well as a "VMI Keydets" moniker that runs along either baseline under the basket. There are concessions on both ends of the arena.

In July 2013, Cameron Hall was ranked among the top venues in [[mid-major]] basketball by MidMajorMadness.com.&lt;ref&gt;July 9, 2013. [http://www.midmajormadness.com/2013/7/9/4509244/mid-major-basketballs-top-venues "Mid-Major Basketball's Top Venues."] Parks Smith. Retrieved July 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Games==
*'''December 5, 1981''' – In the first game in Cameron Hall history, the [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia Cavaliers]] defeated VMI 76–49 before a crowd of 4,460 fans. VMI would go on to have a 1–25 season, including a 1–15 mark in [[Southern Conference]] play.
*'''December 15, 1997''' – In one of the very few occasions that VMI hosted an [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] school, the #2-ranked [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]] defeated the Keydets 105–61 in front of 4,950 fans. The Tar Heels would make the Final Four of that year's [[1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] and finish #1 in the [[AP Poll]].
*'''December 4, 2001''' – Featuring the second contest in Lexington between Virginia and VMI, the Cavaliers defeated the Keydets 89–70.

Despite a late lead, VMI lost 90–87 in overtime.
*'''January 17, 2009''' – With VMI on a ten-game winning streak and off to their best start in decades at 14–2, their nearby rival [[Liberty Flames men's basketball|Liberty]] (12–6) came to Lexington in a highly anticipated match-up. The game was the largest crowd in the venue's history, as well as the first and currently only sellout with 5,029 fans in attendance. Liberty won, however, 91–80, thanks to a 35-point performance from [[Seth Curry]].
*'''March 3, 2009''' – On a Tuesday night, VMI hosted their first [[Big South Conference]] tournament game as the second seed, defeating the [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers men's basketball|Coastal Carolina Chanticleers]] 96–76 to improve to 23–7 on the year.
*'''February 2, 2013''' – In the first nationally televised contest at Cameron Hall, the UNC Asheville Bulldogs defeated VMI 90–79. The game was broadcast on [[ESPNU]].

*'''November 8–9, 2013''' – The Keydets hosted the annual [[All-Military Classic]], an early-season tournament featuring the military academies of [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]], [[United States Military Academy|Army]], and [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force]]. After defeating [[The Citadel Bulldogs basketball|The Citadel]] 82–71 in the first game, they went on to win the tournament with a 71–63 victory over [[Air Force Falcons men's basketball|Air Force]]. It was the school's first regular-season tournament championship since the late 1970s.
*'''March 22, 2014''' – VMI hosted a second-round game of the [[CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament|CIT Tournament]], the first national postseason tournament game held in Cameron Hall. The Keydets beat the [[IPFW Mastodons men's basketball|IPFW Mastodons]] 106–95. Propelled by [[D. J. Covington]]'s 41 points, which was a tournament record, VMI advanced to the quarterfinals.

'''''Celtic Pride''''' is a 1996 American [[comedy film]] written by [[Judd Apatow]] and [[Colin Quinn]], and directed by Tom DeCerchio. It stars [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Mike O'Hara and Jimmy Flaherty, two passionate [[Boston Celtics]] fans, and [[Damon Wayans]] as Lewis Scott, the [[Utah Jazz]]'s All-Star [[shooting guard]].

==Plot==
Best friends for life, gym teacher Mike O'Hara ([[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]) and plumber Jimmy Flaherty ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) are united by their love of Boston and its sports teams, especially the Boston Celtics, who are playing their last season in the old [[Boston Garden]]. When the Celtics drop Game 6 of the NBA Finals to the Utah Jazz, setting up a deciding Game 7 in Boston, Mike and Jimmy find themselves depressed and hopeless. On top of all this, Mike has moved back in with Jimmy after his wife Carol, fed up with his unhealthy obsession with the Celtics, left him and took their son Tommy with her. Jimmy and Mike stumble upon the Jazz's selfish, one-man-show shooting guard Lewis Scott ([[Damon Wayans]]) at a Boston nightclub. Hoping at first to get him drunk enough so he'll be hungover for Game 7, Mike and Jimmy pose as Utah fans. This however leads to them running into their idol [[Larry Bird]] (as himself), who scolds them for being what he thinks are "fair weather" fans. However, the pair get more than they bargained for when the next morning they end up kidnapping Scott after he wakes up at Jimmy's apartment. The two decide to hold Scott until after the game, reasoning that if they are going to prison, they might as well help the Celtics win in the meantime.

Scott's streetwise, arrogant ways contrast with Jimmy and Mike's bumbling blue-collar lifestyle. He derides them for being washed-up losers, and insinuates Mike is only after him because he is jealous of Scott's fame and ability. Mike, on the other hand, berates Scott for his behavior on and off the court, including starring in a campy [[Oscar Mayer]] hot dog commercial and skipping practices. Scott attempts to turn Jimmy against Mike, and, when this fails, escapes, only to be foiled by an antagonistic cabbie and a local cop, Kevin ([[Paul Guilfoyle]]), both fellow Celtics fans.  
   
Ultimately, Mike challenges Scott to a game of one-on-one and the pair is incapacitated well before the final game is set to begin. Before he runs off, Scott presents the pair with a dilemma, they must root for him and hope the Jazz win, otherwise he will turn them both in to the police. Mike reconciles with his wife and son, knowing he might be going to prison, and Jimmy says goodbye to his grandmother. At the game, the two convince the other Celtics fans they are only pretending to root for the Jazz, and the first half ends with the Celtics leading. Mike, who knows the Jazz are losing because Scott refuses to pass the ball, gives him a pep talk from the stands, and Utah closes the gap to one point with a little over 7 seconds remaining. With one play left and the Jazz with the ball, Mike and Jimmy choose life over the Celtics, rooting for Utah and rushing the court after they win. Approached by Kevin who earlier ignored his cries for help, Lewis denies Mike and Jimmy committed the kidnapping, saving them from prison.

A few months later, Mike has promised his wife he would never interfere with an NBA Finals game again. But now it's football season. He and Jimmy sneak into the hotel room of [[Deion Sanders]] at 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.

==Reception==
The film was not a major success despite its star power, grossing less than $10 million domestically, and received very poor reviews, with a ''rotten'' rating of 9% on review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/celtic_pride/ Celtic Pride - Rotten Tomatoes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hal Hinson of [[The Washington Post]] wrote, ''"Celtic Pride" is clearly intended as a spoof on the contemporary mania for athletics. But not only is the picture woefully short on laughs, it's also coarse, overbearing and, in places, downright insulting''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/celticpridehin.htm washingtonpost.com: A Basketball Caper That's Out of Bounds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[TV Guide]] said ''"Celtic Pride supplies predictably lowbrow yocks for jocks, and its rather disturbing racial implications go entirely unacknowledged,"'' and awarded it 1 and half stars out of five.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.tvguide.com/celtic-pride/review/131181 Celtic Pride Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a rare, more positive review, Joe Leydon of [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] said ''"Not quite a three-pointer, but definitely more than an airball, "Celtic Pride" is an uneven but largely likable basketball-themed comedy that should lay up decent B.O. numbers and perform even better in the homevid arena."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/celtic-pride-1200445599/ Celtic Pride | Variety&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cheesehead''' is a nickname in the United States for a person from [[Wisconsin]]&lt;ref&gt;Kapler, Joseph, Jr. "[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/ref/collection/wmh/id/43274 On Wisconsin Icons: When You Say 'Wisconsin', What Do You Say?]" ''Wisconsin Magazine  of History'', vol. 85, no. 3 (Spring 2002), pp. 18-31.&lt;/ref&gt; or for a fan of the [[Green Bay Packers]] [[National Football League|NFL]] [[American football|football]] franchise. The term has also been used as a derogatory nickname for Dutch people.

==Origins==
The use of the term "cheesehead" as a derogatory word for Wisconsinites originated with [[Illinois]] [[American football|football]] and [[baseball]] fans to refer to opposing Wisconsin sports fans. The term, however, was quickly embraced by Wisconsinites and is now a point of pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Foamation: About Us | url = http://www.cheesehead.com/aboutus.asp | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090302092337/http://www.cheesehead.com/aboutus.asp | archivedate = 2009-03-02 | df = }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "Cheesehead" ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''[[wikt:kaaskop#Dutch|kaaskop]]'') as slanderous term towards Dutch people&lt;ref name=wg&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Cheesehead?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-cheesehead.htm|website=Wise Geek|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slur&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheesehead|url=http://www.rsdb.org/slur/cheesehead|website=The Racial Slur Database|accessdate=11 May 2018}}{{Better source|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; started as early as [[World War II]], when German soldiers were known to call the Dutch "cheeseheads".&lt;ref name=wg/&gt; The term "cheesehead" was used in a derogatory manner in the 1969 novel ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'' to describe the jury that sentenced Papillon to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Prescott | first = Peter | page = 218 | isbn = 1-4128-0496-5 | publisher = [[Transaction Publishers]] | title = Encounters with American Culture (1963-1972) | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=loEZQgxzyQIC&amp;pg=PA218 }}.

==The cheesehead hat==
[[File:Cheeseheads_in_Stadium_(14819823518).jpg|thumb|A [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] fan wearing a "cheesehead" hat]]

Deena Bruno first saw a cardboard "cheesehead" hat at a [[Milwaukee Brewers]] vs. [[Chicago White Sox]] game in Chicago in 1987 worn by fellow Milwaukeean Amerik Wojciechowski.&lt;ref&gt;Foamation, Inc. v. Wedeward Enterprises, Inc., 947 F.Supp. 1287 (E.D. Wis. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cigelske |first=Tim |title=When I was 30: Michael Bednar: Cheeseheads were spreading |newspaper=[[MKE (tabloid)|MKE]] |date=September 8, 2005 |url=http://www.mkeonline.com/story.asp?id=353849 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070801032944/http://www.mkeonline.com/story.asp?id=353849 |archivedate=August 1, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph Bruno later made the first one out of foam while he was cutting up his mother's couch. It was made popular by center-fielder [[Rick Manning]], who saw the hat while playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.espn.go.com/greg-garber/|title=Greg Garber News, Videos, Photos, and PodCasts - ESPN|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wxow.com/story/17094560/cheesehead-hat-creator-honored-by-state|title=State honors cheesehead hat creator|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruno started a business to sell the hats as [[novelty item|novelties]].  The "Cheesehead" trademark is owned by Foamation, Inc. of [[St. Francis, Wisconsin]], which began manufacture of the wearable, foam "Cheesehead" in 1987.  It has also been referred to as a "Cheese Hat" since it is legally    a hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Prunty | first = Brendan | title = The Origin of the 'Cheesehead' | newspaper = [[The Star-Ledger]] | date = January 19, 2008 | url = http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2008/01/the_origin_of_the_cheesehead.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, sports fans of Chicago replied to their rivals by wearing [[cheese grater]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-12-26/news/ct-graterheads-met-20131227_1_chicago-bears-green-bay-packers-anti-packers Cheddar shredder] - Chicago Tribune, 26 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chicagoland Speedway''' is a {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} [[tri-oval]] [[Oval track racing|speedway]] in [[Joliet, Illinois]], southwest of [[Chicago]]. The speedway opened in 2001 and used to host [[NASCAR]] racing including the opening event in the NASCAR Cup Series [[NASCAR playoffs|playoffs]]. Until 2011, the speedway also hosted the [[IndyCar Series]], recording numerous close finishes including the closest finish in IndyCar history. The speedway is owned and operated by [[International Speedway Corporation]].

==History==
{{See also|List of NASCAR race tracks}}
First discussions of building a major speedway near [[Chicago]] took place in an informal meeting between [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] President [[Tony George]] and [[International Speedway Corporation]] Chief Executive Officer [[Bill France, Jr.]] in late 1995. Together they formed The Motorsports Alliance, a joint company owned by Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corporation and International Speedway Corporation. By 1995, a major racing facility had been built or was near completion near [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway|Las Vegas]], [[Auto Club Speedway|Los Angeles]] and [[Texas Motor Speedway|the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]]. The Chicago area was an untapped market for motorsports that had potential to be very lucrative.&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicagoland Speedway|url=http://www.chicagolandspeedway.com/About-Us/Facility-History.aspx|publisher=Chicagoland Speedway|accessdate=November 27, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119012501/http://www.chicagolandspeedway.com/About-Us/Facility-History.aspx|archivedate=November 19, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the search began for a site to build a speedway somewhere near Chicago. Several sites were considered, and a track was built in suburban Cicero ([[Chicago Motor Speedway]]), but eventually attention turned to the [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]] area where George Barr had negotiated to build [[Route 66 Raceway]]. Barr convinced Joliet officials to meet with the Motorsports Alliance to discuss building their speedway adjacent to Route 66 Raceway.&lt;ref name="history2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicagoland|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/chicago/index.html|publisher=Nascar.com|accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of Route 66 Raceway, completed in 1998, led to the city conducting an impact study of the proposed speedway. The study revealed the new speedway would generate $300 million for the Joliet and Will County region and over 3,000 jobs.

The Joliet city council unanimously approved the speedway on January 19, 1999.&lt;ref name="approval"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joliet City Council Approves the Motorsports Alliance,LLC and Route 66 Raceway's Plans|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices-regional/6664696-1.html|publisher=All Business|accessdate=November 28, 2010|date=January 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the approval, the Will County Board extended the [[Des Plaines River]] Valley Enterprise Zone in order to give a tax break to the speedway developers.  The tax break news also led to the Joliet High School district threatening to bail out of the enterprise zone, but a compromise was reached.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicagoland Speedway Timeline |url=http://www.joliet.com/raceways/chicagoland/timeline.html|publisher=Joliet.com|accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1999, The Motorsports Alliance combined with Route 66 Raceway LLC to form Raceway Associates, LCC with Coyne as president alongside George and France.&lt;ref name="alliance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article: Motorsports Alliance and Route 66 Raceway Announce Transaction and Land Purchase|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54559965.html|publisher=Highbeam|accessdate=November 28, 2010|date=May 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raceway Associates revealed the track would be a {{convert|1.5|mi}} d-shaped tri-oval superspeedway. [[Joie Chitwood III]] was named vice president and general manager of the facility. During the announcement, France stated the significance of the new speedway: {{quote|The construction of a major league racing facility of this magnitude and quality in the Chicago metropolitan market symbolizes the ongoing transformation of auto racing from a narrowly-focused regional competition to a major mainstream sport. This type of racing will rival the NFL, NBA and Major League baseball for fan and sponsorship involvement. We are absolutely thrilled to be here.|[[Bill France Jr.]]&lt;ref name='history1'/&gt;}}
[[File:Chicagoland Speedway ow.jpg|thumb|left|The [[IndyCar Series]] racing at Chicagoland]]
Architecture and engineering firm [[HNTB]], which has built stadiums and arenas such as the [[RCA Dome]], [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] and the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], was selected to lead the design of the facility. Construction management company [[Bovis Lend Lease]] headed the construction of the speedway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Construction Partner Profiles|url=http://www.chicagolandspeedway.com/Articles/2000/05/CONSTRUCTION-PARTNER-PROFILES.aspx|publisher=Chicagoland Speedway|accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction started in August 1999, with groundbreaking September 28, 1999. On May 8, 2000, in a press conference on Chicago's [[Navy Pier]], the track's name and inaugural events were announced.&lt;ref name='history1'/&gt; Construction of the speedway resulted in a few problems. In the summer of 2000, homes near the speedway were flooded as a result of heavy rains and run-off from excavation. In February 2001, a worker was killed after falling from the skybox suites on top of the grandstands.&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt; Construction was completed in spring 2001.&lt;ref name='history1'/&gt;

The track has seen little expansion since its construction, with the only major addition being the installation of lights around the track in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicagoland Speedway announces addition of lights|url=http://www.racewayreport.com/news/chicagoland.html|publisher=Racewayreport|accessdate=November 28, 2010|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 1 of 4; phase 4 consists of a Bristol type seating capacity completely surrounding the speedway.  The Indycar Series ran at the track since 2001, recording three of the top five closest finishes in Indycar history, including the closest in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IndyCar Sets Record for Entries at Chicagoland Speedway|url=http://www.chicagolandspeedway.com/Articles/2010/08/IndyCar-Sets-Record-for-Entries-at-Chicagoland.aspx|publisher=Chicagoland Speedway|accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the close finishes, the speedway announced IndyCar would not return to the track for the 2011 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement Regarding IZOD IndyCar Series Not Returning in 2011 |url=http://www.chicagolandspeedway.com/Articles/2010/09/Statement-Regarding-IZOD-IndyCar-Series-Not-Returning-in-2011.aspx|publisher=Chicagoland Speedway|accessdate=November 28, 2010|date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speedway also announced changes to the NASCAR schedule for 2011, with the NASCAR Cup Series race moving to September 16–18 as the first race in the 2011 Chase for the Championship. The [[Nationwide Series]] and [[Camping World Truck Series]] also raced the same weekend, in addition, the Nationwide Series had a stand-alone race day on June 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup, NASCAR Nationwide and Truck Series|url=http://www.chicagolandspeedway.com/Tickets-Events/Events/2011/Chase-For-The-NASCAR-Sprint-Cup.aspx|publisher=Chicagoland Speedway|accessdate=November 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126043743/http://www.chicagolandspeedway.com/Tickets-Events/Events/2011/Chase-For-The-NASCAR-Sprint-Cup.aspx|archivedate=November 26, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2015, Andersen Promotions, which organizes the Indy Lights series, conducted an oval test at Chicagoland Speedway, marking the first time since 2010 any level of the Mazda Road to Indy was at the track.  The test was used by INDYCAR officials to give the Dallara IL-15 its first official oval laps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indylights.com/news/belardi-auto-racing-tops-indy-lights-test-at-chicagoland]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Track length of paved oval==
The track length is disputed by the two major series that run at Chicagoland Speedway. The NASCAR timing and scoring use a length of {{convert|1.50|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/en_us/nascar-tracks/chicagoland-speedway.html Chicagoland Speedway at NASCAR.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The IRL timing and scoring used a track length of {{convert|1.52|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.champcarstats.com/races/201014.htm 2010 race result on champcarstats.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Citizens Bank Park''' is a [[baseball park]] located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] within the [[South Philadelphia Sports Complex]]. It is the home of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], the city's [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise. It opened April 3, 2004, and hosted its first regular-season baseball game on April 12 of the same year, with the Phillies losing to the [[Cincinnati Reds]], 4–1.

The ballpark was built to replace the now-demolished [[Veterans Stadium]] (a [[American football|football]]/baseball multipurpose facility), and features a natural grass and dirt playing field as well as a number of Philadelphia-style food stands, including several which serve [[cheesesteak]]s, [[hoagies]] and other regional specialties. The ballpark lies on the northeast corner of the Sports Complex, which includes [[Lincoln Financial Field]], [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]], and [[Xfinity Live!]]. The stadium's capacity is 43,305 seats.

==History==

===Planning===
In 1999, the Phillies and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League]] joined their [[Western Pennsylvania]] counterparts, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], in making requests to replace both [[Veterans Stadium]] and [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]] with separate stadiums. Pressure for new Philadelphia stadiums increased after a railing collapsed at The Vet during the 1998 [[Army–Navy Game]], injuring eight cadets. The Pirates threatened to leave Pittsburgh in 1997, which helped convince the legislature to approve funding for the four proposed stadiums. While Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh approved the pacts swiftly, due to plans already being in place at the time of legislative approval, debate within Philadelphia's city leadership carried on as Pittsburgh opened their stadiums ([[PNC Park]] for the Pirates and [[Heinz Field]] for the Steelers) in 2001. The Eagles agreed to a site slightly southeast of Veterans Stadium, which would become [[Lincoln Financial Field]]. The Eagles' stadium was built on the site of an old food warehouse and celebrated its grand opening in August 2003.
[[File:"Full House at Citizens Bank Park" (Photo).jpg|thumb|left|The Phillies taking on the New York Mets at Citizens Bank Park]]
The Phillies originally wanted a downtown ballpark similar to [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards|Baltimore]], [[Coors Field|Denver]], [[Great American Ball Park|Cincinnati]], [[Progressive Field|Cleveland]], [[Comerica Park|Detroit]] and [[AT&amp;T Park|San Francisco]]. Various locations were proposed, initially at Broad and Spring Garden streets, Spring Garden and Delaware Avenue and next to [[30th Street Station]], where the main post office was located. The team and the city announced that the site would be at 13th and Vine streets in [[Chinatown, Philadelphia|Chinatown]], just north of Interstate 676, within walking distance of [[Center City Philadelphia|Center City]]. There was considerable support for a downtown ball park from business and labor and the city at large. However, Chinatown residents protested, fearing a new ballpark would destroy their neighborhood. The City and team eventually settled on building at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, on the site of an old food warehouse much like Lincoln Financial Field. In the years that followed, residents, fans and owner [[Bill Giles (baseball)|Bill Giles]] expressed regret that the new ball park was not located in Center City. Regardless of location, the team set records in [[2010 Philadelphia Phillies season|2010]] for attendance (3,647,249 fans, averaging 45,028) and sellouts (81), extending a streak dating back to July of [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|2009]] to 123 straight sellouts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=mlb/teams/008/attendance.aspx?team=008 Phillies attendance figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716125657/http://sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=mlb%2Fteams%2F008%2Fattendance.aspx%3Fteam%3D008 |date=2011-07-16 }}, sportsnetwork.com, retrieved October 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new stadium was designed by [[EwingCole]]'s [[Stanley Cole (architect)|Stanley Cole]], who was the stadium's chief architect.&lt;ref name=philly&gt;{{cite news|first=Bonnie L.|last=Cook|title=Stanley M. Cole, 89, architect of ballpark |url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-03-16/news/37747592_1_ewingcole-architect-phillies-charities |work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Philly.com]] |date=2013-03-16 |accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unveiling of the park and ground breaking ceremonies were on June 28, 2001. Following the game that evening, the location of the left-field foul pole was unveiled at the outset of the team's annual 4 July fireworks display. On June 17, 2003, [[Citizens Financial Group|Citizens Bank]] agreed with the team to a 25-year, [[United States dollar|US $]]95 million deal for [[naming rights]] and advertising on telecasts, radio broadcasts, publications and inside the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=[[Associated Press]]|title=Proud Citizens: Phillies new stadium to be called Citizens Bank Park|date=June 17, 2003|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/news/2003/06/17/phillies_citizens_ap/|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballpark was officially topped off on August 12, 2003, and opened in April 2004.

===Modifications===
Shortly after the park opened in 2004, the [[bullpen]]s were reassigned so the Phillies' pitchers used the lower pen and visitors use the upper pen.  This was done to give Phillies' pitchers a better view of the game and to protect them from heckling by rowdy fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Urban View at Phillies' New Park Is So-So, but Hitters Are Regularly Dialing Downtown|first=Bill|last=Center|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040517/news_lz1s17phils.html|newspaper=[[U-T San Diego|The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|date=May 17, 2004|accessdate=June 25, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321034759/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040517/news_lz1s17phils.html|archivedate=March 21, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the team forgot to rewire the bullpen phones after the bullpens were reassigned; so during the first game, the dugout coaches had to communicate with the bullpens by hand signals.

In its first years, Citizens Bank Park allowed 218 home runs in 2004 and 201 in 2005.  More than half of those home runs were to left-field.  Following the 2005 season, the left-field wall was moved back {{Convert|5|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20051028&amp;content_id=1262133&amp;vkey=news_phi&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=phi Phillies.com] "Citizens Bank Walls to Be Moved Back" Retrieved June 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with these modifications, the park has a reputation as one of the most hitter-friendly parks in baseball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://.go.com/mlb/stats/parkfactor Citizens Bank Park listed by as 12th most hitter-friendly park in [[MLB]] for 2009]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, it gave up 149 home runs, the most in the National League and second in the majors behind only [[Yankee Stadium|the new Yankee Stadium]], but has been neutral since, with a .997 [[park factor]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2011 MLB Park Factors|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/parkfactor/_/year/2011|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The first [[no-hitter]] at Citizens Bank Park was thrown by [[Roy Halladay]] on October 6, 2010 against the [[2010 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in the first game of the [[2010 National League Division Series#Philadelphia Phillies vs. Cincinnati Reds|2010 NLDS]].

===Ashburn Alley===
{{Main article|Ashburn Alley}}
[[Image:Phillies Wall of Fame.jpg|thumb|450px|[[Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame]]]]
Behind center field is Ashburn Alley, named after Phillies [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] center fielder [[Richie Ashburn]], who played for the team from 1948 to 1959 and was a Phillies broadcaster from 1963 until his death in 1997.  It is seen by Phillies fans as a compromise between the Phillies and their fans, many of whom wanted Citizens Bank Park named in honor of Ashburn.

Ashburn Alley is named for the slightly-overgrown grass which bordered the third base line at [[Shibe Park]] where Ashburn was famous for laying down bunts that stayed fair. The new Ashburn Alley, located near Ashburn's defensive position, is a walkway featuring restaurants, games and memorabilia from Phillies history.  Ashburn Alley also features a memorabilia shop and a large bronze statue of Ashburn directly behind center field, as well as the [[flag of the United States|U.S. flag]], the flags of the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] and the City of [[Philadelphia]], a [[POW/MIA flag]] and the flags from the Phillies' championships (below).

Features of the Alley are:
[[File:BullsBBQ.jpg|thumb|right|Bull's BBQ in Ashburn Alley]]
[[File:Schmitter.jpg|thumb|The Schmitter]]
*'''All-Star Walk''' — Granite markers pay tribute to Phillies players that have played in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] since its inception in 1933 and runs the length of Ashburn Alley.
*'''Bull's BBQ''' — Relocated to left side of the scoreboard, out of the Alley (in the new "Boardwalk Eats" section), it is named in honor of and owned in part by former Phillies outfielder [[Greg Luzinski|Greg "The Bull" Luzinski]]. This southern-style [[barbecue]] features ribs, turkey legs along with pork, beef and chicken sandwiches and "Bulldogs" ([[kielbasa]]).
*'''Seasons Pizza''' – A new pizza franchise in CBP that took over for Peace A Pizza starting in the 2008 season.
*'''Planet Hoagie''' – Local franchise that makes [[hoagie]]s, including one named after a Phillies player each series.
*'''Campo's''' — Philadelphia [[cheesesteaks]], replaced Rick's Steaks in 2009. The original Campo's opened in 1947.
*'''[[Tony Luke's]]''' — Tony Luke's famous cheesesteaks and roast pork.
*'''Games of Baseball''' — Sponsored by Citizens Bank, this interactive area features a video trivia game, where players compete for prizes, a run-the-bases game with the [[Phillie Phanatic]], and a "Ring 'Em Up" game (formerly a "Pitch 'Em and Tip 'Em" game) where you can throw at targets of a catcher.  Prior to 2010, a huge {{convert|22|ft|m}} high baseball themed pinball game was in this area. Players earn coupons and exchange them for prizes at a kiosk such as hats, shirts and other ballpark-imprinted memorabilia.
*'''Harry The K's Bar and Grille''' — Named for late Phillies broadcaster [[Harry Kalas]], the bi-level bar and grill is built into the base of the [[scoreboard]], and serves finger foods and sandwiches, including "The Schmitter".
[[File:Harry the K's Restaurant Menu Board, Citizens Bank Park.jpg|thumbnail|The menu board at Harry the K's Restaurant at Citizens Bank Park]]

*'''Memory Lane''' and '''[[Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame|Phillies Wall of Fame]]''' — A history of baseball in Philadelphia is located behind the brick batting eye in center field, while the opposite wall commemorates members of the franchise who contributed to the franchise's history. It was in this area where [[Ryan Howard]] hit two of the park's longest home runs, on April 23, 2006 against the Marlins off Sergio Mitre, and against Aaron Harang of the Reds on June 27, 2007, currently the longest home run at Citizen's Bank Park at 505 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reuter|first1=Joel|title=bleacherreport.com/articles/1211802-the-longest-moon-shot-home-run-in-the-history-of-each-mlb-stadium/page/8|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1211802-the-longest-moon-shot-home-run-in-the-history-of-each-mlb-stadium/page/8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second baseman [[Chase Utley]]'s homer was also into this area against the Astros on April 23, 2007 clearing the center wall and becoming only the second player to reach the Memory Lane area after Howard.
*'''Exposed [[Bullpen]]s''' — Located in right-center field, the bi-level bullpens allow the fans to get very close to the players (especially the visiting team, who sit in the top level). Fans are allowed to heckle but must keep it clean. The section above the bullpen that contains the Phillies Wall of Fame is closed to the public about 30 minutes prior to first pitch and remains closed throughout the game, re-opening at the game's conclusion.
*'''Rooftop Bleachers''' — Inspired by the 1920s and 1930s stands on North 20th Street outside [[Connie Mack Stadium|Shibe Park]], this area replicates the seating similar to that outside [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago. During the 2008 season, fans could go on top for $15 on Thursday home dates and get special food offers and events.
*'''Starting Lineup (2004-2017)''' — The Phillies starting lineup that day was illustrated by giant {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} by {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} baseball cards as fans entered the left field gate.

In 2004 and 2005, organist [[Paul Richardson (organist)|Paul Richardson]] performed from Ashburn Alley, as Citizens Bank Park was built without an organ booth.

[[Image:spectrum panorama.jpg|thumb|center|550px|'''Citizens Bank Park''' (''right''), the newest ([[2004 in baseball|2004]]) of the four venues which made up Philadelphia's "Sports Complex" at that time, the four-decade-old '''[[Wachovia Spectrum]]''' (''center''), the oldest (1967) facility at that time (the arena closed October 31, 2009. and was demolished in 2011), tree lined S. Broad St (''left''), and the city's expansive skyline along the horizon to the North, as viewed from the roof of the '''[[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]]''' (1996).]]

===Other attractions===
*'''Diamond and Hall of Fame Clubs''' — Two premium seating areas in the park. The Diamond Club, located behind home plate, includes an air-conditioned indoor club area with exclusive food and souvenir shops where ticket holders can watch batting practice on either side of the club (especially on rainy days). There are a total of 1,164 seats in the Diamond Club. A second level, called the Hall of Fame Club, is located between Sections 212 through 232. This air-conditioned area features exclusive food and souvenir stands akin to The Diamond Club, and also houses memorabilia from the teams' past going back to the 1880s, along with memorabilia from the Philadelphia Athletics. The Hall of Fame Club contains 6,600 seats. In addition to being an attraction to fans, the Hall of Fame level also houses the A/V crew on the first-base side of that level that controls the scoreboard and all other monitors throughout the park and is where [[Dan Baker (PA Announcer)|Dan Baker]] announces the game, as well as the press box, television, and radio booths.
*'''High and Inside Pub''' — Located on the Terrace Level behind home plate, the area is open to groups before the ballgame, and the public once the games start.
*'''Liberty Bell''' — Standing {{convert|102|ft|m}} above street level, this {{convert|52|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} by {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} mechanical, lighted replica of the [[Liberty Bell]] "rings" and lights up after every Phillies home run and victory. In recent years, the Phillies have promoted the [[hashtag]] "#RingTheBell".
*'''Majestic Clubhouse Store''' and '''[[Mitchell &amp; Ness]] Alley Store''' — The clubhouse store is open year-round, and serves as the starting point for tours of the ballpark. The bi-level store features regular merchandise on the first level and Phanatic-themed items on the second level, while the Alley Store is open during all home games and features authentic replicas of older Phillies jerseys made by the famous Philadelphia retailer of vintage uniform shirts and caps as well as other items. During the off-season, customizable jerseys are available in the main store when a stand next to the store is open during the season.
*'''McFadden's Bar and Grille''' — Open year-round, this restaurant combined the McFadden's and Zanzibar Blue menus at the Third Base Gate. Since its opening, it has become a popular post-game (or event) site for the nearby Wells Fargo Center and Lincoln Financial Field. Closed in 2018.
*'''Phanatic Phun Zone''' — Located at the First Base Gate plaza, this playground offers fun for guests eight years old and younger with slides, climb, explore and play games. A separate area for toddlers three years old and younger is found inside.
*'''Phanatic Giant Shoe Slide''' — Located on the Terrace Level near home plate, kids could slide in and out of a replica of one of the Phanatic's sneakers. Removed in 2012.

===Statues===
Besides the Richie Ashburn statue in Ashburn Alley, statues of three other famous Phillies — [[Robin Roberts (baseball)|Robin Roberts]] (at the First Base Gate), [[Mike Schmidt]] (at the Third Base Gate) and [[Steve Carlton]] (at the Left Field Gate) — ring the outside of the facility. Each of the {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} statues were made by local sculptor Zenos Frudakis. Other art found throughout the park includes tile mosaics, murals and terrazzo floors with outlined images of famous players in Phillies history.

In April 2011, the Phillies accepted a gift of a fan-underwritten {{convert|7.5|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[bronze]] statue of legendary broadcaster [[Harry Kalas]].  Created by noted local sculptor [[Lawrence Nowlan]],&lt;ref name=pdn&gt;{{cite news|first=John F.|last=Morrison |title=Lawrence J. Nowlan Jr., 48, sculptor who was working on Frazier statue |url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-08-08/news/41171279_1_frazier-statue-joe-frazier-sculptor |work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |publisher= |date=2013-08-08|accessdate=2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was placed behind Section 141, near the restaurant that bears Kalas' name, after a dedication held on August 16, 2011 prior to that night's game against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].  The statue was unveiled two days later than originally scheduled (the originally-scheduled date is on a plaque on the ground below the statue) because of a rained-out game between the Phillies and the [[Washington Nationals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Phillies Accept Fan-Funded Harry Kalas Statue|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20110331&amp;content_id=17222878&amp;vkey=pr_phi&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=phi|work=philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com|date=March 31, 2011|accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harry Kalas Statue Unveiling Set for Sunday, August 14, During Phillies Alumni Weekend|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20110804&amp;content_id=22739462&amp;vkey=pr_phi&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=phi&amp;partnerId=aw-5200351043006651829-1053|work=philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com|date=August 4, 2011|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green stadium===
The Philadelphia Phillies are the first Major League Baseball team to join the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Green Power Partnership Program which motivates organizations across the world to purchase green power in order to minimize environmental impact. The Phillies announced on April 30, 2008 that their home field, Citizens Bank Park, will be powered with 20 million [[kilowatt-hours]] (kWh) of green energy purchased in Green-e Energy Certified Renewable Certificates (RECs).&lt;ref name="environment"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jasner|first=Andy|publisher=MLB|date=April 30, 2008|title=Phils to Lead Clean Energy Movement|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080430&amp;content_id=2616746&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|accessdate=June 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/c05d85b560358ef28525743b00644055?OpenDocument|title=Philadelphia Phillies Knock It Out of the Park With Green Power|date=April 30, 2008|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA stated that this purchase holds the record in professional sports for the largest purchase of 100% renewable energy.&lt;ref name="environment"/&gt;
The Phillies are among the top three purchasers of green power in Philadelphia, and the executive director of the Center for Resource Solutions, Arthur O'Donnell, wants "other clubs to take their lead."&lt;ref name="environment2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2008/04/28/daily30.html|title=Phillies Fans of Green Energy|last=George|first=John|date=April 30, 2008|work=Philadelphia Business Journal|accessdate=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aramark Corporation]] is the Phillies' food and beverage provider at Citizens Bank Park and they are taking major actions in improving the environmental impact of the Phillies' stadium. Glass, cardboard and plastics used during game day are recycled; frying oil is being recycled to produce [[biodiesel]] fuel, and biodegradable, recyclable, and compostable products, serviceware, and plastics have been introduced.&lt;ref name="environment2"/&gt;

====2012 NHL Winter Classic====
[[File:The 2012 NHL Winter Classic at Citizens Bank Park.jpg|thumb|left|Citizens Bank Park hosting the 2012 NHL Winter Classic.]]
{{Main article|2012 NHL Winter Classic}}
On January 2, 2012, Citizens Bank Park hosted the fifth annual [[2012 NHL Winter Classic|NHL Winter Classic]] between the long time division [[Flyers–Rangers rivalry|rival]]s [[New York Rangers]] and [[Philadelphia Flyers]] before an SRO crowd of 46,967. The game, which was televised throughout the United States and Canada by [[NBC Sports|NBC]] and [[CBC Sports|CBC]] respectively, was won by the Rangers, 3&amp;ndash;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120102&amp;content_id=26253488&amp;vkey=news_phi&amp;c_id=phi|title=NHL makes memories at Citizens Bank Park|date=January 2, 2012|accessdate=January 3, 2012|first=Andy|last=Jasner|website=Philadelphia Phillies|publisher=MLB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2011020569|title=Heroics of Lundqvist, Rupp lift Rangers to Classic win|date=January 2, 2012|accessdate=January 3, 2012|first=Dan|last=Rosen|work=NHL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days earlier on New Year's Eve, 45,667 had attended an alumni game played between teams made up of former [[:File:Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers Alumni Game Group Portrait.jpg|Flyers and Rangers]] who had retired from the NHL between the 1970s and 2011 of which eight (four on each team) were also members of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]. The Flyers' starting goalie for the game, which was won by the Flyers alumni, 3-1, was Hall of Famer [[Bernie Parent]]. He had made his first [[:File:Bernie Parent in 2012 Winter Classic Alumni Game.jpg|on ice appearance]] since his playing career ended prematurely due to an eye injury suffered during a game against the Rangers played at the neighboring (although since demolished) [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]] in February 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carchidi|first=Sam|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/flyers/winter-classic/Winter_Classic_Alumni_Game.html|title=Parent Steals Show As Flyers beat Rangers in Alumni Game|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=January 1, 2012|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days after the 2012 NHL Winter Classic game, a third sell out crowd of 45,663 filled the Park on January 6 to watch the Flyers' [[American Hockey League|AHL]] farm team, the [[Adirondack Phantoms]], defeat the [[Hershey Bears]], 4-3, in overtime. That crowd exceeded by a factor of more than two the previous largest gathering (21,673) to ever attend an AHL game since the league was established in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Phantoms Wear Out Bears Outdoors|first=Marc|last=Narducci|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/flyers/winter-classic/20120107_Phantoms_wear_out_the_Bears_outdoors.html|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=January 7, 2012|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the normal 43,651 baseball seating capacity of the Park having been increased by more than 3,000 with the installation of [[:File:Citizens Bank Park Temporary Seating (2012 NHL Winter Classic).jpg|temporary bleachers]] built over the bullpen area in center field, the trio of outdoor hockey games drew a combined total of 138,296 over the week of Winter Classic events.

===Concerts===
The first concert at the park was [[Jimmy Buffett]] &amp; The Coral Reefer Band on August 25, 2005; they returned on June 14, 2008.

[[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]], The [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Keith Urban]] were scheduled to perform on June 14, 2010, but the show was cancelled.

Other performers who have played at the park include [[Billy Joel]] and [[Elton John]] in a duet concert, [[Bon Jovi]] and [[The Police]].

==Other stadium information==
Due to the City of Philadelphia's smoking ban, smoking is no longer allowed anywhere within the stadium as of the 2018 season.

[[Dan Baker (PA Announcer)|Dan Baker]], public address announcer for the Phillies since 1972, continues to introduce the players.  During each player's first at-bat, Baker, in an excited voice, says, "Now batting for the Phillies, number (#), (position), (player's name)".

For example, a first at-bat introduction would have Baker say, "Now batting for the Phillies, number 11, [[shortstop]] [[Jimmy Rollins]]!"  During subsequent at-bats, players are only announced by their position and name, for example, "Phillies [[first baseman]], [[Ryan Howard]]!"

Baker only uses the city of the opposing team when he announces their players rather than the team nickname, for example, "Now batting for [[Atlanta Braves|Atlanta]], number ten, [[third baseman]] [[Chipper Jones]]", and makes the announcement in a more-subdued tone.

In 2004 and 2005, Citizens Bank Park installed [[Daktronics]] video and message displays in the park. One of the largest incandescent displays in Major League Baseball was installed in left field that was used as a [[Scoreboard#Baseball|scoreboard]] and for giving statistics. There are also out-of-town field-level displays installed in the park that measure approximately 10 feet high by 25 feet wide.&lt;ref name=video&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/ballpark/information/index.jsp?content=facts_figures|title=Philadelphia Phillies: Ballpark information}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2010&amp;ndash;2011 offseason, the Phillies replaced their incandescent scoreboard with a new HD scoreboard that cost $10&amp;nbsp;million. The new screen measures {{convert|76|ft|m}} high and {{convert|97|ft|m}} wide, which nearly triples the size of the old screen, and is the second largest HD screen in the [[National League]], after the San Diego Padres' PETCO Park screen (61&amp;nbsp;ft. high and 124&amp;nbsp;ft. wide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Phillies Upgrading Scoreboard With HD Display|first=Todd|last=Zolecki|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110119&amp;content_id=16461846&amp;vkey=news_phi&amp;c_id=phi|work=philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com|date=January 19, 2011|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
The food at CBP was named as Best Ballpark Food in a survey of [[Food Network]] viewers in the first annual '''''Food Network Awards''''' which first aired on April 22, 2007. On August 14, 2007, it was announced that Citizens Bank Park was voted #1 by [[PETA]] as America's most vegetarian-friendly ballpark, which was repeated in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">'''Currier Island''' is the namesake fictional country of an [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]] frisbee team.

The "country" has participated in all World Beach Ultimate tournaments since 2004.

In WCBU2015 (world national beach tournament 2015) in Dubai, Currier Island sent five teams in the divisions: mixed, masters open, masters mixed, masters women and grand masters &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcbu2015.org/about-wcbu-2015/participating-countries/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Currier Island is an ultimate frisbee team that began as a fictional island nation created by Ivan Cestero and Minh Le. In the Fall of 2004, the first World Champions Beach [[Ultimate (sport)]]  was held in Figuiera de Foz, Portugal. In order to play in the tournament, players needed to be on the official roster of a country's team. The United States roster was already filled. In order to play in the tournament, Cestero and Le (who played ultimate together at Dartmouth College) along with other Dartmouth class of '01 alums (Michael Holmes, Christopher Taylor, Craig Davis, and Michael Gallagher), decided to create a fictional island nation to represent.

Le wrote a letter to the head of the WCBU as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs for Currier Island, stating that the tournament would not be a true world championship if Currier Island was not invited to compete. Together, Cestero and Le convinced the tournament directors to allow Currier Island into the tournament.

Shortly thereafter, the tournament directors replied to Le and Cestero inquiring as to the geographic location of Currier Island, as they were unable to find it online or on any maps. Le and Cestero admitted that the island was fictitious, but the tournament committee decided to allow Currier Island to compete as an international pick-up team. It was decided that at every WCBU tournament from then on, an international team would be allowed to play under the flag of Currier Island. 

The inaugural Currier Island team consisted of players from the U.S., Hungary, Austria, and South Africa. After a week-long training camp in Tarifa, Currier Island beat countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, and Finland to finish 10th in the first annual World Beach Championships. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.currierisland.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Currier Island team has continued to play in beach ultimate tournaments around the world, including Paganello in Italy, Boracay Open in the Philippines, and Wildwood in New Jersey.

'''The Evans Scholars Foundation''' is a nonprofit organization based in [[Golf, Illinois]] that provides full tuition and housing college scholarships to golf caddies. Operated by the [[Western Golf Association]], the Evans Scholars Foundation has helped more than 10,600 [[caddies]] graduate from college since its creation in 1930.

== History ==

The Evans Scholars Foundation was founded in 1930 with money earned and donated by famed amateur golfer Charles [[Chick Evans]].

In 1916, Evans rose to fame by becoming the first amateur golfer to win the Western Amateur, Western Open, U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open. As a result of those wins and other victories, Evans was given several thousand dollars in royalties for recording golf instructions for the [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick Record Company]]. In addition, he received royalties from a golf book written in 1921. If he accepted this money, he would have lost his amateur status. Evans' mother suggested he put the money to good use by sponsoring a scholarship fund for caddies. Evans himself was unable to finish his schooling at [[Northwestern University]]. Evans said his mother "wouldn't think of accepting my money unless we could arrange it to be trusted to furnish educations for deserving, qualified caddies." He also said his mother "pointed out that the money came from golf and thus should go back into golf. It was all her dream — her idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chick Evans' Golf Book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rXpYAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Evans, Charles |location=Chicago |year=1921 |publisher=Reilly &amp; Lee (for Thos E Wilson) |accessdate=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Evans went to the Western Golf Association, an organization that conducted national golf championships, to get their support for his scholarship. The WGA initially declined Evans' request, stating that it was a golf organization interested only in running championships, most notably the [[Western Open]]. In 1929, Evans successfully lobbied the WGA to manage the scholarship on his behalf with the help of his longtime friend and prominent Chicago tax attorney Carleton Blunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Carleton Blunt, 82, Evans Scholars Official| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-05-08/news/8803150173_1_mr-blunt-memorial-service-delray-beach |author= Chicago Tribune | location=Chicago | year= 1988 |publisher= The Tribune Company | accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1930, Evans' dream became a reality when two caddies, Harold Fink and Jim McGinnis, were named the first two recipients of the Evans Scholarship and enrolled at Northwestern, the same university where Evans himself had once been a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Harold Fink, 74, Retired Rand Mcnally Exec| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-10-04/news/8503070646_1_mr-fink-rand-mcnally-caddies |author= Chicago Tribune | location=Chicago | year= 1985|publisher= The Tribune Company | accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Until World War II, all Evans Scholars attended Northwestern, and, in 1940, the first Evans Scholarship House was established on the Evanston campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= A Facelift for the Evans Scholars House| url=http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2010/10/evans-scholars-house-facelift.html |author= White, Erin | location=Evanston | year= 2010 |publisher= Northwestern University | accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Expansion ==

After Evans' initial investment in the Foundation had run out, Blunt, an avid golfer and philanthropist, agreed to continue to help raise money to send more caddies to college. The organization didn't seek outside funding until 1949, relying solely on the generosity of the Western Golf Association's Directors.

To help grow the program as Blunt raised additional funds for scholarship, the Western Golf Association hired Roland F. “Mac” McGuigan, Dean of Men at Northwestern and Faculty Advisor to the Northwestern Chapter of Evans Scholars, in 1949 to serve as its Educational Director.

Following World War II, the program grew dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Evans Scholars Foundation| url=http://www.pgatour.com/tournaments/bmw-championship/charity.html |author= Unknown | location=Unknown | year= 2014 |publisher= BMW North America | accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the foundation sent just 84 caddies to college. By the end of the decade, the number of Scholars enrolled in college increased to 440 and a number of other Scholarship Houses had been established across the country.

As the number of scholarships grew so did the organization's presence on a number of college campus, mainly those in the Midwest. In total, 15 Scholarship Houses have been founded. In order of their founding, Evans Scholarship Houses can be found at: Northwestern, [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], [[University of Michigan]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], [[Michigan State University]], [[Marquette University]], [[University of Minnesota]], [[Ohio State University]], [[Purdue University]], [[University of Colorado Boulder]], [[University of Missouri]], [[Indiana University Bloomington]], [[Miami University]], [[Northern Illinois University]], and [[University of Oregon]].

In 2013, The Evans Scholars Foundation sent Scholars to [[the University of Notre Dame]]. Their enrollment marked the first time the program has sent its caddies to the private university in [[South Bend, Indiana]] in nearly 50 years.

There are now 965 Scholars at 19 universities across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= WGA ESF: Who We Are | url=http://www.wgaesf.org/site/c.dwJTKiO0JgI8G/b.6021363/k.2457/Who_We_Are.htm |author=unknown | location=unknown | year= 2016 | accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2016 the Evans Scholars Foundation celebrated the opening of a new chapter house at the [[University of Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evans Scholars Foundation Celebrates Opening of Scholarship House at the University of Oregon |url=http://www.wgaesf.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=dwJTKiO0JgI8G&amp;b=6021447&amp;ct=14927579}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the program expanded to the [[University of Kansas]].

Since its founding, the Evans Scholars Foundation has invested more than $365 million in the college educations of more than 10,600 Alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= WGA ESF: Fast Facts | url=http://www.wgaesf.org/site/c.dwJTKiO0JgI8G/b.6021373/k.1CAD/Fast_Facts.htm|author=unknown | location=unknown | year= 2016 | accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable alumni==

Several Evans Scholars Alumni have gone on to excel in the business world and other fields.

The list includes CEOs Sam Allen of [[John Deere]], Thomas Falk of [[Kimberly-Clark]] and Timothy Schwertfeger, former longtime chief of [[Nuveen Investments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Evans Scholars: The Loop of their Lives| url=http://golfweek.com/news/2010/sep/14/evans-scholars-loop-their-lives/?print|author= Rude, Jeff | location=New York City | year= 2010 |publisher= GolfWeek | accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iridium Communications]] CEO Matt Desch &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= From Software to Satellites| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/jobs/27boss.html|author= Desch, Matthew J. | location=New York City | year= 2011 |publisher= The New York Times | accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and oil and gas magnate George Solich &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Oil and gas magnate George Solich has knack for winning move| url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_23607495/oil-and-gas-magnate-george-solich-has-knack|author= Migoya, David | location=Denver | year= 2013 |publisher= The Denver Post | accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also Evans Scholars Alumni.

To qualify for an Evans Scholarship, a caddie must meet four key requirements. Candidates, who are nominated by their golf clubs, must have at least two years of outstanding caddying service. Candidates must have an excellent high school academic record, including high standardized test scores. Candidates must demonstrate significant financial need. Candidates must also receive letters of recommendation from club and high school officials attesting to the applicant's character. Candidates are personally interviewed at one of a series of Selection Meetings, co-hosted by the Western Golf Association and its affiliated country clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Evans Scholars Foundation| url=http://www.pgatour.com/tournaments/bmw-championship/charity.html |author= Unknown | location=Unknown | year= 2014 |publisher= BMW North America | accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundraising ==

Funding for the scholarships provided by the Evans Scholars Foundation comes from a variety of sources, including private donations, fundraising events and professional and amateur golf tournaments held across the country each year.

Since its founding in 1950, the Western Golf Association's Par Club has been one of the most important and substantial revenue streams for the Evans Scholars Foundation. There are more than 30,600 Par Club members, many of whom belong to the more than 460 WGA member clubs across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= WGA ESF: Who We Are | url=http://www.wgaesf.org/site/c.dwJTKiO0JgI8G/b.6021363/k.2457/Who_We_Are.htm|author=unknown | location=unknown | year= 2016 | accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Foundation launched its first Match Play Challenge campaign, in which a group of donors pooled together gifts of $50,000 and greater to match every gift of $2,500 and greater the Foundation received. This initiative — now in its seventh year — has raised more than $55 million for caddie scholarships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Match Play Challenge Enters Critical Year-End Stretch | url=https://www.wgaesf.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=dwJTKiO0JgI8G&amp;b=6021461&amp;ct=14520069&amp;notoc=1|author=unknown | location=Chicago | year= 2017 |publisher= WGA ESF | accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, allowing the Foundation to send a record number of caddies to college. 

One of the Foundation's most notable fundraising events in recent years has been the Western Golf Association's Green Coat Gala, held annually in Chicago. Golf legends [[Curtis Strange]], [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], [[Lee Trevino]], [[Gary Player]] and [[Johnny Miller]] have all been honored at the gala, which in 2016 raised $900,000 with Miller as its featured speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Green Coat Gala Raises Record Amount for Caddies | url=http://www.wgaesf.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=dwJTKiO0JgI8G&amp;b=6021447&amp;ct=14927949|author=unknown | location=Chicago | year= 2016 |publisher= WGA ESF | accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation is the benefiting charity of the [[BMW Championship (PGA Tour)]] and has received more than $24.4 million from the tournament since [[BMW]] became its title sponsor in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= 2016 BMW Championship Raises $2.8 Million for ESF | url=http://www.wgaesf.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=dwJTKiO0JgI8G&amp;b=6021461&amp;ct=14939101&amp;notoc=1|author= Staff | location=Chicago | year= 2016 |publisher= WGA ESF | accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to those proceeds, BMW has also agreed to give the program $100,000 if a player gets a hole-in-one during championship play as [[Steve Stricker]] did in 2012 at [[Crooked Stick Golf Club]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Stricker records Hole-in-One| url=http://www.pgatour.com/tourreport/2012/09/stricker-records-hole-in-one.html/ | date= September 2012 |publisher= PGA Tour | accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hunter Mahan]] did during the 2013 BMW Championship at [[Conway Farms Golf Club]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Mahan wins car with ace at BMW Championship| url=http://golfweek.com/news/2013/sep/14/mahans-hole-one-bmw-championship-wins-car/|author= Rude, Jeff | location=New York City | year= 2013 |publisher= Golf Week | accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Jordan Spieth]] did in 2015 during the BMW Championship at Conway Farms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Jordan Spieth's ace paid off for Purdue Engineering student| url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/17511586/jordan-spieth-ace-paid-purdue-student-last-year-bmw-championship|author= Harig, Bob | location=Carmel, Indiana | year= 2016 |publisher= ESPN | accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jason Day]] did it at the 2017 BMW Championship at Conway Farms. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Jason Day Gives Back After BMW Ace, Finds Comfort With New Caddie | url=http://golfweek.com/2017/09/15/bmw-championship-jason-day-new-caddie-rickie-fowler/|author=Romine, Brentley | location=Lake Forest, Illinois | year= 2017 |publisher= Golfweek| accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, the [[Western Amateur]] was hosted by The Alotian Club in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], which donated $150,000 to the nonprofit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Alotian's Western Amateur Golf Tournament Raised $150,000 for Evans Scholars Foundation| url=http://www.arkansasbusiness.com/post/95779/alotians-western-amateur-golf-tournament-raised-150000-for-evans-scholars-foundation/|author= Turner, Lance | location=Little Rock | year= 2013 |publisher= Arkansas Business | accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Amateur has since been hosted by four Illinois clubs: The Beverly Country Club (2014), Rich Harvest Farms (2015), Knollwood Club (2016) Skokie Country Club (2017), and [[Sunset Ridge Country Club]] (2018).

Smaller, regional golf events like the Evans Cup of Colorado, Evans Cup of Oregon and Evans Cup of Washington also raise money for caddie scholarships.

== Awards ==

[[Charity Navigator]], a nonprofit organization that evaluates other charitable organizations across America based on criteria ranging from fiscal responsibility to accountability and transparency, has consistently given the Evans Scholars Foundation a four-star rating, the highest-possible rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Evans Scholars Foundation| url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3679#.Uv4jsfldV8F|author= Charity Navigator | location=Glen Rock, NJ| year= 2013 |publisher= Charity Navigator | accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, the National Scholarship Providers Association, a group whose members include the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Magic Johnson Foundation]] and other notable nonprofits, named the Evans Scholars Foundation as its Scholarship Provider of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= National Scholarship Providers Association announces 2013 Scholarship Providers of the Year| url=http://www.fastweb.com/nfs/fastweb/static/press_releases/2013%20SPOY%20Press%20Release.pdf|author= Amy Weinstein | location=Boulder, CO| year= 2013 |publisher= National Scholarship Providers Association | accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{term|ace}}
{{defn|1= A term typically only used in Japanese ''[[puroresu]]'' for a wrestler designated as the face of the promotion. Not necessarily the same as the top champion. Examples of aces include [[Hayabusa (wrestler)|Hayabusa]] in [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling]], [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Suwama]] in [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_84228.shtml|title=ROH news: New Japan's top star announced for ROH vs. New Japan tour, ROH releases "Field of Honor" details|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=April 1, 2015|accessdate=June 11, 2016|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/f-bt-tp0-20111219-878523.html|script-title=ja:全日諏訪魔ＶＳ大日関本シングル対決実現|date=December 19, 2011|accessdate=June 11, 2016|work=[[Nikkan Sports]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Compare {{gli|face of the company}}''.}}

{{term|alliance}}
{{defn|1= A cooperative relationship developed between two or more wrestlers, whether wrestling as a [[tag team]] or in individual matches.

{{term|angle}}
{{defn|1= A fictional storyline. An angle usually begins when one wrestler attacks another (physically or verbally), which results in revenge.&lt;ref name=amspeech/&gt; An angle may be as small as a single match or a vendetta that lasts for years.

{{term|Apter mag}}
{{defn|1= An old-style professional wrestling magazine that sticks to {{gli|kayfabe}} articles.&lt;ref name=torch/&gt; The term refers to the magazines at one time connected to journalist [[Bill Apter]], such as ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref name=torch/&gt;}}

''Compare {{gli|a-team|A-team}}''.}}
{{term|babyface}}
{{defn|1= ''See {{gli|face}}''.}}
{{term|beat down}}
{{defn|1=[[File:The Shield Teamwork.jpg|thumb|[[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]] performing a {{gli|beat down}} on [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]]]
A situation in which a wrestler or other performer is the recipient of a one-sided beating, usually by a group of wrestlers.&lt;ref name=torch/&gt;}}

{{defn|1= ''See {{gli|missed spot}}''.}}
{{term|blow off}}
{{defn|1= The final match in a {{gli|feud}}.&lt;ref name=torch/&gt; While the involved wrestlers often move onto new feuds, sometimes it is the final match in the promotion for one or more of the wrestlers.&lt;ref name=torch/&gt;}}

{{defn|1= To become exhausted during a match.&lt;ref name=torch/&gt;}}
{{term|book}}{{anchor|Booker}}
{{defn|1={{Ghat|Also '''booker''' and '''booking'''.}}
To determine and schedule the events of a wrestling {{gli|card}}. The person in charge of setting up matches and writing {{gli|angle|angles}} is a "booker".&lt;ref name=torch/&gt; It is the wrestling equivalent of a [[screenwriter]]. A booker can also be described as someone who recruits and hires talent to work in a particular promotion.  The [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa]] defined a booker in 1956 as "[...] any person who, for a fee or commission, arranges with a promoter or promoters for the performance of wrestlers in professional wrestling exhibitions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingperspective.com/legal/consentdecree.html|title=United States v.

{{defn|1= To fall on the mat or ground.&lt;ref name=torch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.65)&lt;/ref&gt; A flat back bump is a bump in which a wrestler lands solidly on their back with high impact, spread over as much surface as possible.&lt;ref name=torch/&gt; A "phantom bump" occurs when a wrestler or referee takes a bump without a plausible reason (usually due to a {{gli|botch}} or other mistake).&lt;ref name=torch/&gt;}}
{{term|burial|2=burial}}
{{defn|1={{Ghat|Also '''bury''' and '''buried'''.}}
The {{gli|work|worked}} lowering (relegation) of a wrestler's status in the eyes of the fans. The opposite of a {{gli|push}}, it is the act of a promoter or {{gli|booker}} causing a wrestler to lose popularity and credibility through means such as forcing them to lose in {{gli|squash}} matches, losing continuously, allowing opponents to no-{{gli|sell}} or {{gli|kick out}} of said wrestler's {{gli|finisher}}, or forcing them to participate in unentertaining or degrading storylines.

{{term|business}}
{{defn|1= Professional wrestling; instead of "profession" or "sport".&lt;ref name=amspeech/&gt;}}

{{defn|1= To instruct the other wrestler of what is going to happen in the match.&lt;ref name=torch/&gt;}}
{{term|call it in the ring}}
{{defn|1= To make up moves and storytelling in a match on the fly, rather than rehearse them in advance. It is essentially the wrestling equivalent of [[improvisational theatre]].}}

In 2005 the [[Shooto]] Organization decided to create splinter Shooto organizations around the world, with their own rankings and champions. Along with a European and American Shooto organization, a Pacific Rim organization was created focusing on Asia (but mostly Japan). This is the title history for the Pacific Rim titles.

The '''Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Serbian Latin]]: Olimpijski komitet Bosne i Hercegovine; [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: Олимпијски комитет Босне и Херцеговине) is the [[non-profit organization]] representing [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] [[Sportsperson|athletes]] in the [[International Olympic Committee]]. The committee organizes Bosnia's representatives at the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] and [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter]] [[Olympic Games]].

Members of the committee are 30 sports federations, which elect the Executive Council composed of the president and twelve members. 

==History==
The Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina was founded on June 4, 1992. It grew out of the ''ZOI '84'' organization, organizers of the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sarajevo]]. The committee maintains the ''Museum of the XIV Winter Olympiad''. The first president of the committee was [[Stjepan Kljuić]], with Izudin Filipović being the first secretary general. It became a full IOC and [[European Olympic Committees|European Olympic Committee]] member in 1993.

Shortly after its foundation, the committee drafted the first athletes to participate under the Bosnian flag in the Olympic games for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]].

The '''Orel''' ("[[eagle]]" in [[Czech language|Czech]]) is a [[Moravia]]-based [[Czechs|Czech]] youth movement and [[gymnastics]] organization which emerged between 1896–1909 as [[Catholic Church]]-supported competitor of another Czech sport movement [[Sokol]] (founded 1862), oriented more nationalistic and rather anti-Catholic. Orel movement, defining itself as "Christian sport organization", still exists and currently has about 19,000 members. Since 1921 is member of international sport association [[Fédération internationale catholique d'éducation physique et sportive|FICEP]]. Party always cooperated in close with [[Moravian-Silesian Christian Social Party in Moravia|Moravian-Silesian Christian Social Party]] and later with the [[Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party|Czechoslovak People's Party]].

A similar organization with the same name was organized also in the [[Slovene Lands]] and in [[Croatia]], where it successfully competed with the local Sokol movement. It was dissolved in the early 1930s by the following dictatorship in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

'''Pedal Car Racing''' is a [[Race track|circuit racing]] [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance sport]] where teams of up to six drivers race single-seater human powered [[sports car]]s in races of up to twenty-four hours duration. Four team members share the driving (increasing to six in 24 hour races), with each completing as many laps as he or she can before handing over to the next driver.
Therefore the races are very similar in make up and tactics to endurance sports car races.

==Racing pedal cars==
The cars are mainly sports [[prototype]]s built by or for the teams that race them. There are no commercial suppliers of racing pedal cars in the UK, although Karbyk in Italy  make racing pedal cars commercially. All cars have to comply with the international [[pedal car]] specification, but this is quite an open formula so the cars are as varied as the teams who race them with many different solutions to the same problem.

==Classes==
There are seven classes in pedal car racing all sharing circuit space. They aim to ensure the safe lapping of back markers by making it a skill that faster drivers must acquire.

==British Pedal Car Championship==
First run in 1996, the  British Pedal Car Championship is a series of endurance pedal car races which runs between April and September every year in the UK. Typically, there are 7 races totalling just over 60 racing hours including the Shenington 24 hour race in June (at which double points are awarded).

The championship is organised and run by the [http://www.pedalcarracing.info British Federation of Pedal Car Racing]

==The Shenington 24 hour race==
The Shenington 24 hour race takes place at Shenington Kart Track near Banbury, UK at the end of June and is the flagship event of the British Pedal Car Championship. The race comprises a night practice session on Friday and then the race starts at midday Saturday. Six drivers are allowed per car and all cars must carry head and tail lights for night racing.

The 2013 edition was won by BAR racing in a car designed and built by formula 1 engineer, the late Gary "Gadget" North.

In 2014, Apollo Racing took the win just ahead of championship rivals Wing Racers and cycling club Rugby Velo.

So far, a cycling club has not won the Shenington 24 hour race despite entries from Winchcombe Wheelers, Rugby Velo, Treads CC and Simonstrong Media-Velo in recent years.

'''Ray Winder Field''' was a [[baseball park]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. The ballpark sat with home plate in roughly the north-northwest corner of the property. The former boundaries of the park were Interstate 630 (south, right field); Jonesboro Drive (west, right field corner); South Monroe Street (west, first base stands); buildings on driveway extended from Ray Winder Drive (north, third base stands); buildings bordering South Palm Street (east, right field). The field was in operation for around 74 years.

==History==
===Construction===
The ballpark was constructed during 1931, as a new home field for the [[Little Rock Travelers]], later to become the [[Arkansas Travelers]], [[minor league]] baseball team.  The Travelers vacated [[Kavanaugh Field]], near [[Little Rock Central High School]], and opened their 1932 season on April 13 at the newly completed ballpark, which was initially called '''Travelers Field''' for the team name.

===Renaming===
On August 26, 1966, Traveler Field was renamed '''Ray Winder Field''', after Raymond Winder, who was involved with the business end of The Travelers for some sixty years. Winder started as a ticket seller in 1915, was named as the Arkansas Traveler business manager in 1931, and became part owner in 1944. The Traveler franchise was moved to Shreveport following the 1958 season, leaving Little Rock without a baseball club for the first time since 1914. Traveler Field sat empty during the 1959 season while efforts continued to return minor league baseball to Little Rock.  After a public stock drive raised funds to purchase a bankrupt New Orleans franchise, the Travelers were resurrected in Little Rock for the 1960 season.  Ray Winder was again asked to manage the day to day details of rebuilding the club.

===Valentine era===
[[File:Bill Valentine 2007.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Valentine in 2007]]
In 1976, [[Bill Valentine]], a former American League umpire, was chosen as general manager for the Travelers.&lt;ref name="Valentine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Valentine Retires From Arkansas Travelers|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090317&amp;content_id=525301&amp;vkey=pr_t574&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t574|work=milb.com|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valentine was general manager until 2007, 31 years. He remained executive vice president for two more seasons, before retiring in March 2009.&lt;ref name="Valentine"/&gt;

Faced with an aging ballpark and limited funds, Valentine began to promote the historic nature of Ray Winder Field. Through his efforts the ballpark gained recognition as one of the oldest active parks in minor league baseball, and he encouraged fans traveled to Little Rock to experience the nostalgia and sample the baseball history represented by Ray Winder Field. He promoted the home of the Arkansas Travelers as "A great place to see old-time baseball, wholesome entertainment aimed squarely at the family market."

===Closing===
In 2005, construction began on a new ballpark in North Little Rock which would eventually become the home of the Arkansas Travelers.  On September 3, 2006, the final game of the 2006 season, a capacity crowd filled Ray Winder Field as fans returned for the last Traveler game at Ray Winder Field.  During this game,  the Travelers beat the Springfield Cardinals by a score of 7 to 3.  Beginning with the 2007 season, the Arkansas Travelers home ballpark is [[Dickey-Stephens Park]] in [[North Little Rock]].
[[Image:RWF-ticket.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Commemorative ticket for the Arkansas Travelers final game in Ray Winder Field.]]
Ray Winder Field sat vacant for almost five years while forces outside of organized baseball determined the future of this historic ballpark.  Many{{who|date=July 2013}} recognized the ballpark as a historic structure both for the City of Little Rock and for baseball, and it was proposed that the park be restored as a functional baseball field for city and college teams as had been done with [[Rickwood Field]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] .  Others{{who|date=July 2013}} proposed demolishing the historic ballpark in order to utilize the area as a parking lot for the nearby University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The Arkansas Zoological Foundation wanted the Little Rock Zoo to expand into Ray Winder by refitting the grandstand as a viewing area for an Asian elephant exhibit.  During all of these discussions, the underlying atmosphere from the City of Little Rock was one of disinterest and apathy, with no apparent recognition of the park's historic ties to baseball's golden era, and no interest in assisting in the landmark ballpark's preservation.

Ultimately, the decision was made to sell the park to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, with all structures to be razed and the land cleared for use as a parking lot.  The City of Little Rock again confirmed that they had no interest preserving the park.  Several sales were held to disperse remaining artifacts to baseball fans from across the country who had visited this ballpark, and on May 14, 2011, the park was opened for a final time when the remaining wooden seats, dating to 1932, were dismantled and given to fans on a first-come, first-served basis.

On July 12, 2012 the score board and the light poles were left standing while the rest of the park and all other structure were torn down and removed, and the ground paved over. It had also been hotly debated {{who|date=July 2013}} to allow the Little Rock Zoo to use the site for expansion and  improvements for the betterment of the animals and visitors.

As of March 9, 2018 the score board and light poles still remain.

The '''Smolensk Ring'''  is a [[Race track|circuit]] in western [[Russia]] near the town of [[Safonovo, Safonovsky District, Smolensk Oblast|Safonovo]] in the settlement of [[Verkhnedneprovsky]]. It is located {{convert|90|km|sp=us}} east of its namesake city of [[Smolensk]] and about {{convert|250|km|sp=us}} west of [[Moscow]].

The construction of the {{convert|3.4|km|adj=on|sp=us}} circuit started in 2007, and the inaugural international event was a round of the [[FIA European Truck Racing Championship]] in August 2010.

The Smolensk Ring was initially supposed to host rounds of the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]] in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superleagueformula.com/races |title=Races |publisher=Superleague Formula |date=2011-06-05 |accessdate=2011-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224085255/http://www.superleagueformula.com/races |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f1sa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28808:sf--superleague-formula-announces-world-cup-2011-races-across-4-continents&amp;catid=29:various-categories&amp;Itemid=122 |title=SF : Superleague Formula announces World Cup 2011 races across 4 continents |publisher=F1sa.com |date=2011-05-02 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this was later postponed to 2012 because the track didn't complete in time modifications required to garner the necessary FIA track license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/92508 |title=SF : Smolensk round postponed |publisher=autosport.com |date=2011-06-22 |accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian GT3 Race Postponed for 2011|url=http://gt3europe.com/newsitem.php?key=653|publisher=FIA GT3 European Championship Website|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The track was designed by [[Hermann Tilke]] and his design bureau using the features of the pre-existing landscape of the designated area, resulting in a 3362 meter long, 12–15 meter wide track containing fast corners, straights and twisty sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superleague.gptickets.com/index.asp?pageid=WWW_SFGP_COM_CI_SMOLENSK&amp;raceid=smolensk |title=2011 Superleague Formula of Russia at Smolensk Ring - 9–11 September 2011 |publisher=Superleague.gptickets.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smolenskring.ru/ |title=Автодром "Смоленское кольцо" - российская гоночная трасса |publisher=Smolenskring.ru |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race track, with the prerequisite modifications in place, will fulfil the International Automobile Federation ([[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]) requirements for a Grade 2 race track, and the first category according to the classification of the Russian Automobile Federation (RAF). With the FIA Grade 2 license, the Smolensk Ring will be able to host motor racing for all classes except [[Formula One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smolenskring.ru%2F |title=Google Translate |publisher=Translate.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one-day multi-event race over land and sea is held in June of every year under the authority of Commodore [[HMS Collingwood (establishment)|HMS Collingwood]] and involves a maximum of 6 five-person teams. Created by Commander Duncan Forer of the [[Royal Navy]], an active adventurer and sailor, the first race was run on 27 June 2012. It is the only adventure race worldwide that has been granted an official partnership by the [[British Armed Forces]].

The race starts with all yachts crossing the start line at Gillkicker Point with all members on board at 9 a.m. (BST).  Boats then sail west to [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]] Marina where the designated runner and support cyclist will land and begin a run along a prescribed route of approximately 25 miles from west to east to [[Bembridge]] Harbour at the other end of the island.  The runner is entirely supported by a cyclist and the runner must not swap with the cyclist. The remaining sailing team then sail as quickly as possible to Bembridge, where they will rendezvous with the running team who will both then re-board the yacht. If the runner fails to reach Bembridge by 7 p.m. then the whole team are retired from the race (due to the tidal window).  The boat and whole team then sail to meet the finish line at Gillkicker, which is the same as the earlier start line.

'''Wimbledon Stadium''', also known as '''Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium''', was a [[greyhound racing]] track located in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] in southwest [[London]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Track Search|url=http://www.gbgb.org.uk/tracks.aspx|publisher=Greyhound Board of Great Britain|accessdate=24 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225034358/http://www.gbgb.org.uk/tracks.aspx|archivedate=25 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also hosted [[stock car]] and other small circuit motor racing events and until 2005 hosted [[motorcycle speedway]].&lt;ref&gt;Bamford, R &amp; Jarvis J.(2001). ''Homes of British Speedway''. {{ISBN|0-7524-2210-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium hosted the [[English Greyhound Derby]] every year between 1985 and 2016.

The stadium closed in March 2017&lt;ref name="Farewell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/attractions/gone-to-the-dogs-a-farewell-to-wimbledon-greyhound-stadium-a3498816.html|title=A farewell to Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium, London's last dog track|date=24 March 2017|work=London Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Last Night"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/3173366/the-wimbledon-greyhound-stadium-will-see-its-last-night-of-action-on-saturday-ending-the-dog-tracks-89-year-history/|title=Greyhound racing in London on its last legs with Wimbledon dog track to close this weekend after 90 years|date=24 March 2017|work=The Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; with owners Galliard Homes Limited set to build more than 600 flats on the site; there will also be an 11,000 seater football stadium built on the site which will be the new home of [[AFC Wimbledon]], with capacity to increase it to a 20,000 seater stadium at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wimbledonguardian.co.uk/news/14137138.AFC_Wimbledon_stadium_will_be__the_end_of_greyhound_racing___but_the_sport_will_fight_Plough_Lane_plans/|title=AFC Wimbledon stadium will be 'the end of greyhound racing', but the sport will fight Plough Lane plans|work=Wimbledon Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/27/wimbledon-greyhounds-afc-plough-lane-stadium|title=Underdog eat underdog: the victims of football's greatest fairytale|date=27 July 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The club is planning to play at [[New Plough Lane|the new stadium]] from the start of the 2019–20 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://haydonsroadnorthcommunity.wordpress.com/2016/12/11/wimbledon-stadium-demolition-to-start-in-april/|title=Wimbledon Stadium demolition ‘to start in April’|date=11 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium==
The facilities included a brick fronted grandstand seating 8,000, executive suites, several bars and catering facilities, including a large waiter-service restaurant. The stadium was surrounded by a large open-air car park.

==Greyhound racing==

===Origins===
The greyhound stadium was constructed east of the [[River Wandle]] on a section of land that was difficult to build on due to the fact that it was marsh land and was prone to flooding. The only buildings near this plot of land were a chamois leather mills, a large sewage works and the Plough public house. Slightly to the east was Summerstown Road which held the only housing in the immediate area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/526160/171815/10/101150|title=OS County Series Surrey (partial) 1920|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficult plot did not deter South London Greyhound Racecourses Ltd who went ahead with plans to build a large stadium ready for 1928. However financial difficulties halted the project until a consortium headed by [[Will Cearns|Bill 'WJ' Cearns]] whose firm had been responsible for the construction of the stadium stepped in with a sufficient funds to save the project.&lt;ref name="Genders 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Encyclopedia of Greyhound Racing, page 90|year=1981|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=07207-1106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening ===
The opening night was on 19 May 1928 with the first race being won by a greyhound called Ballindura trained by Harry Leader. The Burhill kennels in Walton-on-Thames became renowned within the industry housing the hounds for Wimbledon and were initially used by trainers Stanley Biss, Harry Leader and Ken Appleton. Paddy McEllistrim, a Norfolk farmer and breeder of greyhounds, and Sidney Orton joined the training kennels soon after.&lt;ref name="Genders 1981"/&gt;

===1928–1939===
Wimbledon was the first track to introduce weighing scales in 1929 at their kennels so that the racing public could be issued with the greyhounds weights before racing. The same year Harry Leader returned to Ireland and was replaced by Sidney Orton. New events called the [[The Puppy Derby|Puppy Derby]], International, Wimbledon Gold Cup and Wimbledon Spring Stakes were all inaugurated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Greyhound and Racing Greyhound, page 86|year=1975|publisher=Page Brothers (Norwich)|isbn=0-85020-0474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1929 Arundel Kempton purchased [[Mick the Miller]] for £2,000 as a present for his wife placing him with Sidney Orton. The track had already been associated with Mick the Miller because the champion took up residence at the kennels of Paddy McEllistrim during the duration of the [[1929 English Greyhound Derby]]. Con Stevens was the first Racing Manager and was instrumental in bringing the first classic race to Wimbledon in the form of the [[Laurels (greyhounds)|Laurels]] in 1930. Mick the Miller claimed his second Derby crown in 1930 propelling himself, the sport and Wimbledon into national fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=NGRC book of Greyhound Racing, page 40|year=1990|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=0-7207-1804-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trainer Joe Harmon arrived from [[White City Stadium|White City]] in 1934 and Paddy Fortune another new trainer at Wimbledon claimed a second Derby victory for the track in 1939 after the greyhound Highland Rum won the race. The 'Two Year Old Produce Stakes' was introduced in 1935 and another event called 'The Key' started in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Encyclopedia of Greyhound Racing, page 93|year=1981|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=07207-1106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940s===
During [[World War II]] the stadium suffered bomb damage but continued to race. The well known Irish dog Tanist was put with Paddy McEllistrim but found it hard to cope with the sharp turns at Wimbledon and failed to win a single race by the end of June 1940. In contrast Ballynennan Moon became a Wimbledon greyhound after Billy Quinn negotiated a sale to Mrs Cearns, wife of the managing director of Wimbledon Stadium and the greyhound became a household name during the war years. In 1942 after a winter rest he won the Walthamstow Stakes and Wimbledon Spring Cup before embarking on forty wins and seven second places from 48 starts. After finishing first fourteen times in succession he was beaten a neck by Laughing Lackey failing to beat Mick the Miller's 19 straight wins record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Encyclopedia of Greyhound Racing, pages 90-91|year=1981|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=07207-1106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new puppy called Ballyhennessy Seal first came to the scene in 1943 after moving from [[Catford Stadium]] to Wimbledon and was placed in the care of Stan Martin. Martin had joined the Wimbledon training ranks following the death of Joe Harmon in 1942. Martin guided Ballyhennessy Seal to a third Derby success for the track in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dack|first=Barrie|title=Greyhound Derby, the first 60 years, pages 80-81|year=1990|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s===
After the war the Wimbledon management constructed a new grandstand in place of the war damaged section of the stadium. They also introduced new perforated tote tickets following continual losses on forged tote tickets every Saturday to the tune of £1,000. Ballymac Ball was the next greyhound to win the Derby for Wimbledon, the brindle dog won the 1950 event for Stan Martin. In 1950 the Instaprint photo timer that was tested at Wimbledon and given the seal of approval to use throughout Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dack|first=Barrie|title=Greyhound Derby, the first 60 years, pages 90-92|year=1990|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Con Stevens continued to manage the stadium throughout the 1950s overseeing the success of the track and a fifth Derby success came in 1957 after the Dennis Hannafin (brother of Jerry) trained Ford Spartan took the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dack|first=Barrie|title=Greyhound Derby, the first 60 years, pages 101-104|year=1990|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Paddy Fortune died and his kennels were taken over by George Waterman. Within a few months Sidney Orton retired and his son Clare Orton took up his position at Wimbledon. Clare had been a trainer in his own right for nearly ten years.&lt;ref name="Genders 1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=NGRC book of Greyhound Racing, page 41|year=1990|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=0-7207-1804-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
Phil Rees Sr. joined the track as a trainer in the 1960s following the retirement of Dennis Hannafin and the Greyhound Express Merit Puppy Championship was renamed the [[Juvenile (greyhounds)|Juvenile]] in 1963. George Waterman died and his Burhill kennel range was given to new trainer Nora Gleeson. The three times Derby winning trainer Paddy McEvoy also joined the track in the late 1960s. Towards the end of 1969 the possibility of the stadium being redeveloped was a possibility but the [[Greyhound Racing Association]] bought a major part of Wimbledon after a prolonged battle against developers.

===1970s===
The redevelopment issue could still not be discounted because the GRA Property Trust was buying and selling stadiums but the GRA invested into the stadium and raised the winning prize money levels of the Laurels to £2,000 in 1970 and £5,000 one year later. In 1972 the GRA sealed a deal to buy Wimbledon outright and bring the track fully under the GRA banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Encyclopedia of Greyhound Racing, page 92|year=1981|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=07207-1106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paddy McEllistrim and Stan Martin both retired in 1974 and were replaced by Paddy's daughter Norah and Sam Sykes, a former head lad to Clare Orton. Con Stevens resigned from the board of directors at Wimbledon bringing to an end his 46 years of association with the track.&lt;ref name="Genders 1990"/&gt;

Wimbledon introduced new technology in 1976 after using a sectional timing mechanism and they were one of the first tracks to use the system of grading (selecting greyhounds in classes on ability). In the same year Mutts Silver won the Derby when trained by Phil Rees Snr; Rees handed his kennels to his son Philip Rees Jnr just two years later, after retiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dack|first=Barrie|title=Greyhound Derby, the first 60 years, pages 154-157|year=1990|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
In 1985 Wimbledon was chosen to host the sport's premier event, the Greyhound Derby, following the closure of [[White City Stadium|White City]]. Industry support for [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] to be given the premier race was inconsequential because GRA owned the rights to the competition and would not allow a non-GRA track to have the race. Bob Rowe the Chief Racing Manager for the GRA was also the Racing Manager at Wimbledon when the track was handed the Derby and trainers Tom Foster and David Kinchett both joined from White City. The first Derby at Wimbledon was held over a new distance of {{convert|480|m|yd}} and ended with a seventh success for the track, Pagan Swallow won the competition and the Rees family became the second father and son to each win the Derby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dack|first=Barrie|title=Greyhound Derby, the first 60 years, pages 185-188|year=1990|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Hitch joined the tack in 1987 when [[Slough Stadium]] closed and then following the closure of Harringay the prestigious [[Oaks (greyhounds)|Oaks]] for bitches was switched to Wimbledon.

===1990s===
In 1990 a greyhound called Druids Johno was given to [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]], the half share of the black dog had been given to the Prince by Patsy Byrne during a charity meeting at [[Kingsmead Stadium]], [[Canterbury]]. Byrne joined Wimbledon as a trainer in 1991 and sponsored the long running International in the process. This appointment brought about the last ever Derby triumph for the track. Ballinderry Ash took the 1991 title bringing the total to eight just one behind Wembley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes/Sellers|first=Julia/John|title=Ladbrokes Greyhound Fact File, pages 142-143|year=1992|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-22-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 GRA parent company Wembley plc announced losses of £8&amp;nbsp;million despite a £13&amp;nbsp;million profit in its UK operation. Simon Harris became Racing Manager arriving from Hall Green, while Bob Rowe remained based at Wimbledon in his role of Chief Racing Manager of the GRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Paul|title=The Official NGRC Greyhound Racing Yearbook, pages 271-277|year=1995|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=186054-010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the Intertrack betting service was introduced for the first time, enabling race-goers at other tracks around the country to view the racing and place bets direct into the Wimbledon [[Tote board|tote]]. In 1998 the Laurels switched to sister track [[Belle Vue Stadium]] and a new Paddock Bar extension costing £500,000 opened, the kennels were moved to the first bend to facilitate the change.&lt;ref name=GS2018&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/remember-november-2-2/|title=Remember When - November 1998|publisher=Greyhound Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;.One year later [[Sky Sports]] screened their first greyhound meeting at Wimbledon which included the Springbok final. The GRA switched the Grand National to Wimbledon from Hall Green in 1999.

===2000–2017===
[[Rapid Ranger]] completed two Derby successes in 2001 emulating Mick the Miller and Patricias Hope before both Seamus Cahill and Bernie Doyle joined Wimbledon from Catford and [[Reading Stadium]] respectively in 2002. Catford closed in 2003 resulting in three new trainers, John Simpson, Tony Taylor and John Walsh. Catford Racing Manager Derek Hope took over from the departing Simon Harris who left for [[Brandon Stadium|Coventry]]. In 2003 Wimbledon underwent £70,000 track improvements following criticism received during the [[2002 English Greyhound Derby|2002 Derby]], consequently the {{cvt|680|m|yd}} trip changed to {{cvt|688|m|yd}} and the {{cvt|868|m|yd}} changed to {{cvt|872|m|yd}}. In 2004 trainer Tommy Foster retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobbs|first=Jonathan|title=Greyhound Annual 2003, page 62|year=2002|publisher=Raceform|isbn=1-904317-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Westmead Hawk]] won the 2005 &amp; 2006 Greyhound Derby becoming the fourth greyhound to complete two wins and in 2007 trainer Ray Peacock died. Racing Manager Derek Hope left to join William Hill and was replaced by Gary Matthews and in 2008 Richard Rees, son of Philip Rees Jnr, became a third generation trainer at Wimbledon; Philip Rees Jnr retired due to ill health. Tony Morris who stood as a track bookmaker also retired after a long career at Wimbledon.  In 2010 Wimbledon underwent major changes in time for the Derby, the grandstand was switched to the far side of the stadium and the physical makeup of the track altered meaning new track records would be set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/greyhound-racings-biggest-sponsors-sign.html|title=Greyhound Racing's biggest sponsors sign again|publisher=Greyhound Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes cost around £400,000 which were partly funded by a £195,370 grant from the British Greyhound Racing Fund.&lt;ref name=GS2018/&gt;

The GRA allowed the Grand National to go to [[Central Park Stadium]] in [[Sittingbourne]] in 2012 and leading trainer Norah McEllistrim left for [[Brighton &amp; Hove Greyhound Stadium]]. Bob Rowe switched to Belle Vue as the Racing Manager along with the Oaks.

==Speedway==
Until 2005, the stadium was also home for over 50 years to the now defunct [[Wimbledon Dons]] [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] team and was famous for hosting the Internationale meeting every season.&lt;ref name="jacobs"/&gt; from 1962 until 1981. though they did hold a qualifying round of this competition in 1961. Speedway arrived at Wimbledon in the 1928 pioneer season and a team was entered in the league competitions from 1929 to 1939. The team was re-formed after the war and the Dons raced in the top flight National League Division One from 1946 to 1964. The Dons were multiple winners of the league in the 1950s. The Dons were founder members of the British League in 1965. Upon their reopening after the war, in 1946, average weekly attendances were in excess of 30,000, until the early 1950s, when the sport declined rapidly in popularity. Still Wimbledon were one of the top teams with healthy crowd figures, and upon the closure of Wembley in 1956 remained the only team in London (apart from sporadic appearances by New Cross in 1959/1960 and 1963) until 1963 when Hackney entered the Provincial League, and 1964 when West Ham reopened in the National League (now known as the 1st Division Elite League).

Wimbledon's tenure in the top flight came to an end in the 1980s and the Greyhound Racing Association (the owners of the stadium at the time) decreed that speedway would end at the end of the 1986 season. However, a London stockbroker, David Pickles, gathered together a consortium in the 1986/87 close season who ensured that the famous Dons would continue to run. They employed the ex-England team manager [[John Berry (speedway promoter)|John Berry]] and enjoyed reasonable success on and off the track in their first season. After a disagreement with Berry and the other members of the board, Pickles dramatically resigned as chairman of the club during the match with Exeter in September 1987, selling his shares back to the other members. With a few reshuffles at board level and the leaving of Berry, the remaining members eventually took Wimbledon back to the British League Division One in 1991, but the move proved disastrous and with only a couple of months of the season having been ridden, the financial losses proved to be so great that they were forced to disband the team. In June 1991 Wimbledon rode their final meeting, which was eventually curtailed due to the weather. Although there was no longer any league racing at the Plough Lane stadium the team continued their league fixtures for the 1991 season moving to Eastbourne and were known as the Eastbourne Dons.

Having been defunct for eleven years, the team were then reopened again in 2002 but were finally disbanded completely in 2005 as a result of the dispute between the team's promoters and the owners of the stadium, the Greyhound Racing Association, over a proposed large rent increase.&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, Norman (2001). ''Speedway in London''. {{ISBN|0-7524-2221-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stock car racing==
[[File:Wimbledon stadium.jpg|thumb|right|A Stock Car meeting at Wimbledon Stadium]]
Plough Lane also hosted [[Motor racing|Motor Racing]] events promoted by Spedeworth International, including [[Superstox]], [[British Stock car racing|Stock Cars]], [[Hot Rods (oval racing)|Hot Rods]] and [[Banger racing|Bangers]]. The first stock car meeting at Wimbledon was on 29 September 1962 (the [[Superstox]] World Championship) and the circuit quickly became Spedeworth's flagship venue with the World Final being held there every year up to and including 1974. The World Championship, along with other key race meetings such as Carnival Night, became very popular and were often 'ticket only' events filled to capacity. The stadium also boasted its own stock car racing teams in 1966 (London Sparrows) and 1971–72 (Canaries/Dons). The 1966 team shared its base with [[New Cross Stadium]]. The Unlimited [[Banger racing|Banger]] World Final also used to take place at Wimbledon until the event moved to [[Foxhall Stadium]] in 2008. This was due to the introduction of the [[London low emission zone]] which made it too expensive for the transporters to travel to the venue.

==Other notable events==
Wimbledon Stadium was the scene for part of the music video for the [[Queen (band)|Queen]] song "[[Bicycle Race]]", in which 65 professional female models, all nude, rode on bikes around the stadium.

Banger racing at the stadium was featured in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] police series ''[[The Sweeney]]''. The story was entitled "Contact Breaker".

In 2007 the stadium was purchased by development company Galliard Homes Limited when the Greyhound Racing Association was put up for sale (along with all of its assets) by parent company Wembley PLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://betting.betfair.com/greyhound-racing/wimbledon-racing/are-afc-wimbledon-going-back-t-130907.html |title=Are AFC Wimbledon going back to the dogs? |publisher=Betting.betfair.com |date=13 September 2007 |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the local professional football team [[AFC Wimbledon]] expressed interest in building their new football stadium on the site of the greyhound track in collaboration with Galliard Homes. A joint planning application made by Galliard Homes and AFC Wimbledon to build the new football stadium, together with 600 residences, on the site of the greyhound stadium was approved by the London Borough of Merton in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wimbledonguardian.co.uk/news/14137138.AFC_Wimbledon_stadium_will_be__the_end_of_greyhound_racing___but_the_sport_will_fight_Plough_Lane_plans/|title=AFC Wimbledon stadium will be 'the end of greyhound racing', but the sport will fight Plough Lane plans|work=Wimbledon Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/22/greyhound-racing-dog-track-sadiq-khan-afc-wimbledon-stadium-london|title=Greyhound racing in peril as Khan backs AFC Wimbledon plans|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to prevent the closure of the stadium failed; a £20 million rival planning bid to build a new greyhound stadium, submitted by Irish businessman Paschal Taggart, the owner of [[Shelbourne Park]] Greyhound Stadium, and a bid by pressure group 'Save Wimbledon Stadium Action Group' to have the stadium granted listed status by [[Historic England]] both came to nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://irishpost.co.uk/irish-bid-london-greyhound-track/|title=Irish businessman bidding to save London's last greyhound racing track|work=Irish Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/afc-wimbledon-overcome-major-hurdle-in-their-quest-to-return-to-plough-lane-a3570231.html&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was finally closed on 25 March 2017,&lt;ref name="Farewell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Last Night"/&gt; and demolition of the stadium and associated buildings commenced on the 16th March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/demolition-work-gets-underway-afc-14414179&lt;/ref&gt; A ceremony to commence this work was attended by AFC Wimbledon CEO Erik Samuelson, Wimbledon FC legends Dave Bassett and Ian Cooke, who were joined by Leader of Merton Council Stephen Alambritis, to celebrate another significant milestone in the new club's journey towards a Plough Lane return.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gallery/wimbledon-stadium-demolition-14420375&lt;/ref&gt;
