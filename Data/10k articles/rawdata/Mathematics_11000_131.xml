'''Algebra tiles''' are [[mathematical manipulatives]] that allow students to better understand ways of algebraic thinking and the concepts of [[algebra]]. These tiles have proven to provide concrete models for [[elementary school]], [[middle school]], [[high school]], and college-level introductory [[algebra]] [[students]]. They have also been used to prepare [[prison]] inmates for their [[General Educational Development]] (GED) tests.&lt;ref name="Kitt, N"&gt;Kitt 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Algebra tiles''' allow both an algebraic and geometric approach to algebraic concepts. They give [[students]] another way to solve algebraic problems other than just abstract manipulation.&lt;ref name="Kitt, N" /&gt; The [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] ([[NCTM]]) recommends a decreased emphasis on the memorization of the rules of [[algebra]] and the symbol manipulation of [[algebra]] in their ''Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for Mathematics''. According to the [[NCTM]] 1989 standards "[r]elating models to one another builds a better understanding of each".&lt;ref name="Stein, M"&gt;Stein 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical attributes==

[[File:Algebra tile physical attributes.jpg|thumb|Examples of algebra tiles]]

Algebra tiles are made up of small [[squares]], [[rectangles]], and large squares. The small square, the unit tile, represents the [[1 (number)|number one]]; the rectangle represents the [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; and the large square represents &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;. The side of the &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; tile is equal to the length of the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tile. The width of the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tile is the same as the side of the unit tile. Additionally, the length of the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tile is often not an [[integer multiple]] of the side of the unit tile.

The tiles consist of two colors: one to show [[Positive number|positive]] values and another to show [[Negative number|negative]] values. A ''zero pair'' is a negative and a positive unit tile (or a negative and a positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tile, or a negative and a positive &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; tile) which together form a sum of zero.&lt;ref name="Kitt, N" /&gt;

==Uses==

===Adding integers===
Adding Integers is the best place to start when you want to get used to the idea of representing numbers with a quantity of tiles.  Any integer can be represented by using the same number of tiles in the correct color.  For example for a 6 you could select six yellow tiles.  For -3 you would select 3 red tiles.  The tiles are usually double sided with yellow on one side and red on the other. This allows the student to grasp the powerful concept of "taking the opposite"  A negative simply means the opposite.  So one yellow tile is positive one and the opposite (flip it over) is negative one.  This is idea comes in handy when dealing with a - (-2)  Start with two negative ones (red side) and the extra negative means take the opposite or flip them over. - (-2)  =  2.

When adding tiles think of combining the quantities together.  if you are adding 2 + 3 you combine 2 yellow tiles with 3 yellow tiles and combined you have 5 yellow tiles.  The same idea works for combining negative numbers.  If you are adding -3 + -1 you combine 3 red tiles with 1 red tile to get 4 red tiles. -3 + -1 = -4

When you add positive numbers to negative numbers using algebra tiles you need to bring in the idea of "elimination"  or "zero pairs"  every time you add a positive one to a negative one they eliminate each other resulting in a zero.  This is true for any number of tiles. As long and you have the same quantity and opposite sign they will eliminate each other (or create a zero pair). For example if you add -5 + 7 you will combine five red tiles with seven yellow tiles.  You can match the red and yellow tiles up one at a time to eliminate 5 of the yellow tiles and you will be left with 2 yellow tiles and no red tiles. -5 + 7 = 2.

If you start with more yellow tiles than red,  your answer will be positive.  If you start with more red tiles than yellow, your answer will be negative.

One more example:  -5 + 2.  You are combining 5 red tiles with 2 yellow tiles.  The 2 yellow tiles will eliminate (or form a zero pair) with 2 of the red tiles leaving 3 red tiles behind.  -5 + 2 = -3

===Subtracting integers===
Algebra tiles can also be used for subtracting [[integers]]. A person can take a problem such as &lt;math&gt;6-3=?&lt;/math&gt; and begin with a group of six unit tiles and then take three away to leave you with three left over, so then &lt;math&gt;6-3=3&lt;/math&gt;. Algebra tiles can also be used to solve problems like &lt;math&gt;-4-(-2)=?&lt;/math&gt;.get if you had the problem &lt;math&gt;-4+2&lt;/math&gt;. Being able to relate these two problems and why they get the same answer is important because it shows that &lt;math&gt;-(-2)=2&lt;/math&gt;. Another way in which algebra tiles can be used for [[integer]] [[subtraction]] can be seen through looking at problems where you subtract a positive [[integer]] from a smaller positive [[integer]], like &lt;math&gt;5-8&lt;/math&gt;. Here you would begin with five positive unit tiles and then you would add zero pairs to the five positive unit tiles until there were eight positive unit tiles in front of you. Adding the zero pairs will not change the value of the original five positive unit tiles you originally had. You would then remove the eight positive unit tiles and count the number of negative unit tiles left. This number of negative unit tiles would then be your answer, which would be -3.&lt;ref name="phschool.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phschool.com/professional_development/teaching_tools/pdf/using_algebra_tiles.pdf |title=Prentice Hall School |publisher=Phschool.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212085508/http://www.phschool.com/professional_development/teaching_tools/pdf/using_algebra_tiles.pdf |archive-date=2012-02-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplication of integers===
[[Multiplication]] of [[integers]] with algebra tiles is performed through forming a rectangle with the tiles. The [[length]] and [[width]] of your rectangle would be your two [[divisor|factors]] and then the total number of tiles in the rectangle would be the answer to your [[multiplication]] problem. For instance in order to determine 3×4 you would take three positive unit tiles to represent three rows in the rectangle and then there would be four positive unit tiles to represent the columns in the rectangle. This would lead to having a rectangle with four columns of three positive unit tiles, which represents 3×4. Now you can count the number of unit tiles in the rectangle, which will equal 12.

===Modeling and simplifying algebraic expressions===
Modeling algebraic expressions with algebra tiles is very similar to modeling [[addition]] and [[subtraction]] of integers using algebra tiles. In an expression such as &lt;math&gt;5x-3&lt;/math&gt; you would group five positive x tiles together and then three negative unit tiles together to represent this algebraic expression. Along with modeling these expressions, algebra tiles can also be used to simplify algebraic expressions. For instance, if you have &lt;math&gt;4x+5-2x-3&lt;/math&gt; you can combine the positive and negative x tiles and unit tiles to form zero pairs to leave you with the expression &lt;math&gt;2x+2&lt;/math&gt;. Since the tiles are laid out right in front of you it is easy to combine the like terms, or the terms that represent the same type of tile.&lt;ref name="phschool.com" /&gt;

The [[distributive property]] is modeled through the algebra tiles by demonstrating that a(b+c)=(a×b)+(a×c). You would want to model what is being represented on both sides of the equation separately and determine that they are both equal to each other.  If we want to show that &lt;math&gt;3(x+1)=3x+3&lt;/math&gt; then we would make three sets of one unit tile and one x tile and then combine them together to see if would have &lt;math&gt;3x+3&lt;/math&gt;, which we would.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regentsprep.org/rEGENTS/math/realnum/Tdistrib.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516175511/http://www.regentsprep.org/rEGENTS/math/realnum/Tdistrib.htm |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solving linear equations using addition===

The [[linear equation]] &lt;math&gt;x-8=6&lt;/math&gt; can be modeled with one positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tile and eight negative unit tiles on the left side of a piece of paper and six positive unit tiles on the right side. To maintain equality of the sides, each action must be performed on both sides.&lt;ref name="Kitt, N" /&gt; For example, eight positive unit tiles can be added to both sides.&lt;ref name="Kitt, N" /&gt; Zero pairs of unit tiles are removed from the left side, leaving one positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tile. The right side has 14 positive unit tiles, so &lt;math&gt;x=14&lt;/math&gt;.

File:Algebra tile x=2.jpg|Algebra tile model of &lt;math&gt;x=8&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Solving linear equations using subtraction===

The equation &lt;math&gt;x+7=10&lt;/math&gt; can be modeled with one positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tile and seven positive unit tiles on the left side and 10 positive unit tiles on the right side. Rather than adding the same number of tiles to both sides, the same number of tiles can be subtracted from both sides. For example, seven positive unit tiles can be removed from both sides. This leaves one positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tile on the left side and three positive unit tiles on the right side, so &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kitt, N" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Solving linear systems===
Linear systems of equations may be solved algebraically by isolating one of the variables and then performing a substitution. Isolating a variable can be modeled with algebra tiles in a manner similar to solving linear equations (above), and substitution can be modeled with algebra tiles by replacing tiles with other tiles.

===Multiplying polynomials===
When using algebra tiles to multiply a [[monomial]] by a [[monomial]] you first set up a rectangle where the [[length]] of the rectangle is the one [[monomial]] and then the [[width]] of the rectangle is the other [[monomial]], similar to when you multiply [[integers]] using algebra tiles. Once the sides of the rectangle are represented by the algebra tiles you would then try to figure out which algebra tiles would fill in the rectangle. For instance, if you had x×x the only algebra tile that would complete the rectangle would be x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the answer.

[[Multiplication]] of [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]]s is similar to [[multiplication]] of [[monomials]] when using the algebra tiles . Multiplication of [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]]s can also be thought of as creating a rectangle where the [[Integer factorization|factors]] are the [[length]] and [[width]].&lt;ref name="Stein, M" /&gt; As with the [[monomials]], you set up the sides of the rectangle to be the [[Integer factorization|factors]] and then you fill in the rectangle with the algebra tiles.&lt;ref name="Stein, M" /&gt; This method of using algebra tiles to multiply [[polynomials]] is known as the area model&lt;ref&gt;Larson R: "Algebra 1", page 516. McDougal Littell, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and it can also be applied to multiplying [[monomials]] and [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]]s with each other. An example of multiplying [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]]s is (2x+1)×(x+2) and the first step you would take is set up two positive x tiles and one positive unit tile to represent the [[length]] of a rectangle and then you would take one positive x tile and two positive unit tiles to represent the [[width]]. These two lines of tiles would create a space that looks like a rectangle which can be filled in with certain tiles. In the case of this example the rectangle would be composed of two positive x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tiles, five positive x tiles, and two positive unit tiles. So the solution is 2x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+5x+2.

===Factoring===
[[File:Algebra tile factoring.jpg|thumb|Algebra tile model of &lt;math&gt;x^2+3x+2&lt;/math&gt;]]

In order to factor using algebra tiles you start out with a set of tiles that you combine into a rectangle, this may require the use of adding zero pairs in order to make the rectangular shape. An example would be where you are given one positive x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tile, three positive x tiles, and two positive unit tiles. You form the rectangle by having the x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tile in the upper right corner, then you have two x tiles on the right side of the x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tile, one x tile underneath the x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tile, and two unit tiles are in the bottom right corner. By placing the algebra tiles to the sides of this rectangle we can determine that we need one positive x tile and one positive unit tile for the [[length]] and then one positive x tile and two positive unit tiles for the [[width]]. This means that the two [[Integer factorization|factors]] are &lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x+2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kitt, N" /&gt;  In a sense this is the reverse of the procedure for multiplying [[polynomials]].

===Completing the square===
The process of [[completing the square]] can be accomplished using algebra tiles by placing your x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tiles and x tiles into a square. You will not be able to completely create the square because there will be a smaller square missing from your larger square that you made from the tiles you were given, which will be filled in by the unit tiles. In order to [[complete the square]] you would determine how many unit tiles would be needed to fill in the missing square. In order to [[complete the square]] of x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+6x you start off with one positive x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tile and six positive x tiles. You place the x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tile in the upper left corner and then you place three positive x tiles to the right of the x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tile and three positive unit x tiles under the x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tile. In order to fill in the square we need nine positive unit tiles. we have now created x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+6x+9, which can be factored into &lt;math&gt;(x+3)(x+3)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Donna Roberts |url=http://www.regentsprep.org/Regents/math/algtrig/ATE12/completesq.htm |title=Using Algebra Tiles to Complete the Square |publisher=Regentsprep.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818170201/http://www.regentsprep.org/Regents/math/algtrig/ATE12/completesq.htm |archive-date=2013-08-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20262">[[Mathematics]] encompasses a growing variety and depth of subjects over [[History of mathematics|history]], and comprehension requires a system to categorize and organize the many subjects into more general '''areas of mathematics'''. A number of different classification schemes have arisen, and though they share some similarities, there are differences due in part to the different purposes they serve. In addition, as mathematics continues to be developed, these classification schemes must change as well to account for newly created areas or newly discovered links between different areas. Classification is made more difficult by some subjects, often the most active, which straddle the boundary between different areas.

A traditional division of mathematics is into [[pure mathematics]], mathematics studied for its intrinsic interest, and [[applied mathematics]], mathematics which can be directly applied to real world problems.&lt;ref&gt;For example the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] groups its mathematics articles as [[wikisource:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Classified List of Articles#Mathematics|Pure, Applied, and Biographies]].&lt;/ref&gt;
This division is not always clear and many subjects have been developed as pure mathematics to find unexpected applications later on. Broad divisions, such as [[discrete mathematics]] and [[computational mathematics]], have emerged more recently.

An ideal system of classification permits adding new areas into the organization of previous knowledge, and fitting surprising discoveries and unexpected interactions into the outline.
For example, the [[Langlands program]] has found unexpected connections between areas previously thought unconnected, at least [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].

==Classification systems==
*The [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC) is produced by the staff of the review databases [[Mathematical Reviews]] and [[Zentralblatt MATH]]. Many mathematics journals ask authors to label their papers with MSC subject codes. The MSC divides mathematics into over 60 areas, with further subdivisions within each area.
*In the [[Library of Congress Classification]], mathematics is assigned the subclass QA within the class Q (Science). The LCC defines [[Library of Congress Classification: Class Q -- Science#QA Mathematics|broad divisions]], and individual subjects are assigned specific numerical values.
*The [[List of Dewey Decimal classes#500 – Science|Dewey Decimal Classification]] assigns mathematics to division 510, with subdivisions for [[Algebra]] &amp; [[number theory]], [[Arithmetic]], [[Topology]], [[Analysis]], [[Geometry]], [[Numerical analysis]], and [[Probabilities]] &amp; [[applied mathematics]].
*The [https://arxiv.org/archive/math Categories within Mathematics] list is used by the [[Arxiv]] for categorizing [[preprints]]. It differs from MSC; for example, it includes things like [[quantum algebra]].
*The [[International Mathematical Union|IMU]] uses its [http://www.mathunion.org/activities/icm/icm-2010-program-structure/ programme structure] for organizing the lectures at its four-yearly [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]]. One of its top-level sections that MSC doesn't have is [[Lie theory]].
*The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] includes a couple of mathematical [http://portal.acm.org/ccs.cfm?part=author&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=GUIDE categories] F. Theory of Computation and G. Mathematics of Computing.
*[[MathOverflow]] has a [http://mathoverflow.net/tags tag system].
*Mathematics book publishers such as [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] ([https://www.springer.com/mathematics?SGWID=0-10042-0-0-0 subdisciplines]), [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge]] ([http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/other_subject/item1521/?site_locale=en_GB Browse Mathematics and statistics]) and the [[American Mathematical Society|AMS]] ([http://www.ams.org/bookstore/textbooks subject area]) use their own subject lists on their websites to enable customers to browse books or filter searches by subdiscipline, including topics such as [[mathematical biology]] and [[mathematical finance]] as top-level headings.
*Schools and other educational bodies have [[syllabus]]es.
*Research institutes and university mathematics departments often have sub-departments or study groups. e.g. [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]] has [http://siam.org/activity/ activity groups] for its members.

==Major divisions of mathematics==

===Pure mathematics===

====Foundations====
;[[Recreational mathematics]]
: From [[magic square]]s to the [[Mandelbrot set]], numbers have been a source of amusement and delight for millions of people throughout the ages. Many important branches of "serious" mathematics have their roots in what was once a mere puzzle and/or game.
;[[History of mathematics|History]] and [[List of mathematicians|biography]]
: The history of mathematics is inextricably intertwined with the subject itself. This is perfectly natural: mathematics has an internal organic structure, deriving new theorems from those that have come before. As each new generation of mathematicians builds upon the achievements of our ancestors, the subject itself expands and grows new layers, like an onion.
;[[Mathematical logic]] and [[Foundations of mathematics|foundations]], including [[set theory]]
: Mathematicians have always worked with logic and symbols, but for centuries the underlying laws of logic were taken for granted, and never expressed symbolically. '''Mathematical logic''', also known as '''symbolic logic''', was developed when people finally realized that the tools of mathematics can be used to study the structure of logic itself. Areas of research in this field have expanded rapidly, and are usually subdivided into several distinct departments.
:;[[Model theory]]
:: Model theory studies mathematical [[structure (mathematical logic)|structures]] in a general framework. Its main tool is [[first-order logic]].
:;[[Set theory]]
:: A [[Set (mathematics)|set]] can be thought of as a collection of distinct things united by some common feature. Set theory is subdivided into three main areas. [[Naive set theory]] is the original set theory developed by mathematicians at the end of the 19th century. [[Axiomatic set theory]] is a rigorous [[axiom]]atic theory developed in response to the discovery of serious flaws (such as [[Russell's paradox]]) in naive set theory.  It treats sets as "whatever satisfies the axioms", and the notion of collections of things serves only as motivation for the axioms. [[Internal set theory]] is an axiomatic extension of set theory that supports a [[logically consistent]] identification of ''illimited'' (enormously large) and ''infinitesimal'' (unimaginably small) elements within the [[real number]]s. See also [[List of set theory topics]].
:;[[Proof theory]] and [[constructive mathematics]]
:: '''Proof theory''' grew out of [[David Hilbert]]'s ambitious program to formalize all the proofs in mathematics. The most famous result in the field is encapsulated in [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]. A closely related and now quite popular concept is the idea of [[Turing machines]]. '''Constructivism''' is the outgrowth of [[L.E.J. Brouwer|Brouwer]]'s unorthodox view of the nature of logic itself; constructively speaking, mathematicians cannot assert "Either a circle is round, or it is not" until they have actually exhibited a circle and measured its roundness.

====Arithmetic====
[[Arithmetic]] is the study of numbers and the properties of operations between them.

====Algebra====
The study of structure begins with [[number]]s, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s and their [[arithmetic]]al operations, which are recorded in [[elementary algebra]]. The deeper properties of these numbers are studied in [[number theory]]. The investigation of methods to solve equations leads to the field of [[abstract algebra]], which, among other things, studies [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, structures that generalize the properties possessed by everyday numbers. Long standing questions about [[compass and straightedge]] construction were finally settled by [[Galois theory]]. The physically important concept of [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s, generalized to [[vector space]]s, is studied in [[linear algebra]].

; [[Order theory]]
: For any two distinct  real numbers, one must be greater than the other. Order Theory extends this idea to sets in general. It includes notions like [[lattice (order)|lattices]] and ordered [[algebraic structure]]s. See also the [[order theory glossary]] and the [[list of order topics]].
; General [[algebraic system]]s
: Given a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], different ways of combining or relating members of that set can be defined. If these obey certain rules, then a particular algebraic structure is formed. [[Universal algebra]] is the more formal study of these structures and systems.
; [[Number theory]]
: Number theory is traditionally concerned with the properties of integers. More recently, it has come to be concerned with wider classes of problems that have arisen naturally from the study of integers. It can be divided into elementary number theory (where the integers are studied without the aid of techniques from other mathematical fields); [[analytic number theory]] (where [[calculus]] and [[complex analysis]] are used as tools); [[algebraic number theory]] (which studies the algebraic numbers  - the roots of [[polynomial]]s with integer [[coefficient]]s); [[geometric number theory]]; [[combinatorial number theory]]; [[transcendental number theory]]; and [[computational number theory]]. See also the [[list of number theory topics]].
; [[Field theory (mathematics)|Field theory]] and polynomials
: Field theory studies the properties of [[Field (mathematics)|fields]]. A field is a mathematical entity for which addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are [[well-defined]].  A polynomial is an expression in which constants and variables are combined using only addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
; [[Commutative ring]]s and [[commutative algebra|algebras]]
: In [[ring theory]], a branch of abstract algebra, a commutative ring is a ring in which the multiplication operation obeys the [[commutative operation|commutative law]]. This means that if a and b are any elements of the ring, then a×b=b×a.  Commutative algebra is the field of study of commutative rings and their ideals, modules and algebras.  It is foundational both for [[algebraic geometry]] and for algebraic number theory. The most prominent examples of commutative rings are [[polynomial ring|rings of polynomials]].

====Analysis==== 
Within the world of mathematics, '''[[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]''' is the branch that focuses on change: [[Derivative|rates of change]], [[Integral|accumulated change]], and multiple things changing relative to (or independently of) one another.

Modern analysis is a vast and rapidly expanding branch of mathematics that touches almost every other subdivision of the discipline, finding direct and indirect applications in topics as diverse as [[number theory]], [[cryptography]], and [[abstract algebra]]. It is also the language of science itself and is used across [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[physics]], from [[astrophysics]] to [[X-ray crystallography]].

====Combinatorics====
[[Combinatorics]] is the study of finite or discrete collections of objects that satisfy specified criteria. In particular, it is concerned with "counting" the objects in those collections ([[enumerative combinatorics]]) and with deciding whether certain "optimal" objects exist ([[extremal combinatorics]]). It includes [[graph theory]], used to describe inter-connected objects (a graph in this sense is a network, or collection of connected points). See also the [[list of combinatorics topics]], [[list of graph theory topics]] and [[glossary of graph theory]].  A ''combinatorial flavour'' is present in many parts of [[problem-solving]].

====Geometry and topology====
[[Geometry]] deals with spatial relationships, using fundamental qualities or [[axiom]]s. Such axioms can be used in conjunction with mathematical definitions for points, straight lines, curves, surfaces, and solids to draw logical conclusions.  See also [[List of geometry topics]]

;[[Convex geometry]] and [[discrete geometry]]
: Includes the study of objects such as [[polytopes]] and [[polyhedra]]. See also [[List of convexity topics]]
;Discrete or [[combinatorial geometry]]
: The study of geometrical objects and properties that are [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] or [[combinatorial]], either by their nature or by their representation. It includes the study of shapes such as the [[Platonic solids]] and the notion of [[tessellation]].
;[[Differential geometry]]
: The study of geometry using calculus. It is very closely related to [[differential topology]]. Covers such areas as [[Riemannian geometry]], [[curvature]] and [[differential geometry of curves]]. See also the [[glossary of differential geometry and topology]].
;[[Algebraic geometry]]
: Given a [[polynomial]] of two real [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], then the points on a plane where that function is zero will form a curve. An [[algebraic curve]] extends this notion to polynomials over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] in a given number of variables. Algebraic geometry may be viewed as the study of these curves. See also the [[list of algebraic geometry topics]] and [[list of algebraic surfaces]].
;[[Topology]]
: Deals with the properties of a figure that do not change when the figure is continuously deformed. The main areas are point set topology (or [[general topology]]), [[algebraic topology]], and the topology of [[manifold]]s, defined below.
:;[[General topology]]
:: Also called ''point set topology''. Properties of [[topological space]]s. Includes such notions as [[open set|open]] and [[closed set|closed]] [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[compact space]]s, [[continuous function]]s, [[limit of a sequence|convergence]], [[separation axiom]]s, [[metric space]]s, [[dimension theory]].  See also the [[glossary of general topology]] and the [[list of general topology topics]].
:;[[Algebraic topology]]
:: Properties of algebraic objects associated with a topological space and how these algebraic objects capture properties of such spaces.  Contains areas like [[homology theory]], [[cohomology theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[homological algebra]], some of them examples of [[functor]]s.  Homotopy deals with [[homotopy group]]s (including the [[fundamental group]]) as well as [[simplicial complexes]] and [[CW complexes]] (also called ''cell complexes'').  See also the [[list of algebraic topology topics]].
:;[[Manifold]]s
:: A manifold can be thought of as an ''n''-[[dimension]]al generalization of a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] in the usual 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The study of manifolds includes  differential topology, which looks at the properties of differentiable functions defined over a manifold.  See also [[complex manifold]]s.

====Probability and statistics====
{{See also|glossary of probability and statistics}}

*[[Probability theory]]: The mathematical theory of [[Statistical randomness|random]] phenomena.

See also the [[list of statistical topics]].

====Computational sciences====
;[[Numerical analysis]]
: Many problems in mathematics cannot in general be solved exactly.

: {{further|Energy principles in structural mechanics|Flexibility method|Direct stiffness method|Finite element method}}
; [[Materials science|Mechanics of deformable solids]]
: Most real-world objects are not point-like nor perfectly rigid. More importantly, objects change shape when subjected to forces.

: {{further|Fluid dynamics|Mechanics of fluids|Rheology|Electrodynamics|Plasma Physics|Gas dynamics|Aerodynamics}}
; [[Particle mechanics]]
: In mathematics, a [[particle]] is a point-like, perfectly rigid, solid object. Particle mechanics deals with the results of subjecting particles to forces. It includes [[celestial mechanics]]—the study of the motion of celestial objects.

====Other applied mathematics====
*[[Operations research]] (OR), also known as operational research, provides optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems. OR uses [[mathematical model]]ing, [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[mathematical optimization]].
*[[Mathematical programming]] (or mathematical optimization) minimizes (or maximizes) a real-valued function over a domain that is often specified by constraints on the variables. Mathematical programming studies these problems and develops [[iterative method]]s and [[algorithm]]s for their solution.

In [[mathematics]], the '''arithmetic–geometric mean''' ('''AGM''') of two positive [[real number]]s {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} is defined as follows:

Call {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 a_0 &amp;= x,\\
 g_0 &amp;= y.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then define the two interdependent [[sequence]]s {{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|(''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 a_{n+1} &amp;= \tfrac12(a_n + g_n),\\
 g_{n+1} &amp;= \sqrt{a_n g_n}\, ,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the square root takes the [[principal value]]. These two sequences [[limit of a sequence|converge]] to the same number, the arithmetic–geometric mean of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}; it is denoted by {{math|''M''(''x'', ''y'')}}, or sometimes by {{math|agm(''x'', ''y'')}}.

The arithmetic-geometric mean is used in fast [[algorithm]]s for [[exponential function|exponential]] and [[trigonometric functions]], as well as some [[mathematical constant]]s, in particular, [[computing π|computing &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;]].

==Example==
To find the arithmetic–geometric mean of {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 24}} and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 6}}, iterate as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcccl}
 a_1 &amp; = &amp; \tfrac12(24 + 6) &amp; = &amp; 15\\
 g_1 &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{24 \cdot 6} &amp; = &amp; 12\\
 a_2 &amp; = &amp; \tfrac12(15 + 12) &amp; = &amp; 13.5\\
 g_2 &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{15 \cdot 12} &amp; = &amp; 13.416\ 407\ 8649\dots\\
 &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp;
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The first five iterations give the following values:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! {{math|''n''}}
! {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}
! {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}

|}

The number of digits in which {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} agree (underlined) approximately doubles with each iteration. The arithmetic–geometric mean of 24 and 6 is the common limit of these two sequences, which is approximately {{val|13.4581714817256154207668131569743992430538388544}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=agm%2824%2C+6%29 agm(24, 6) at WolframAlpha]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first algorithm based on this sequence pair appeared in the works of [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]. Its properties were further analyzed by [[Gauss]].&lt;ref name="BerggrenBorwein2004"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=J.L. Berggren |editor2=Jonathan M. Borwein |editor3=Peter Borwein |title=Pi: A Source Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QlbzjN_5pDoC&amp;pg=PA481|year=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-20571-7|page=481|chapter=The Arithmetic-Geometric Mean of Gauss|author=David A. Cox}} first published in ''[[L'Enseignement Mathématique]]'', t. 30 (1984), p. 275-330&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The geometric mean of two positive numbers is never bigger than the arithmetic mean (see [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]]); as a consequence, for {{math|n&gt;0}}, {{math|(''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is an increasing sequence, {{math|(''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is a decreasing sequence, and {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''M''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') ≤ ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. These are strict inequalities if {{math|''x'' ≠ ''y''}}.

{{math|''M''(''x'', ''y'')}} is thus a number between the geometric and arithmetic mean of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}; it is also between {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}.

If {{math|''r'' ≥ 0}}, then {{math|''M''(''rx'',''ry'') {{=}} ''r M''(''x'',''y'')}}.

There is an integral-form expression for {{math|''M''(''x'',''y'')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 M(x,y) &amp;= \frac{\pi}{2} \div \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{x^2\cos^2\theta+y^2\sin^2\theta}}\\
        &amp;= \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot \frac{x + y}{K\left( \frac{x - y}{x + y} \right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''K''(''k'')}} is the [[elliptic integral|complete elliptic integral of the first kind]]:

:&lt;math&gt;K(k) = \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1 - k^2\sin^2(\theta)}} &lt;/math&gt;

Indeed, since the arithmetic–geometric process converges so quickly, it provides an efficient way to compute elliptic integrals via this formula. In engineering, it is used for instance in [[elliptic filter]] design.&lt;ref name="Dimopoulos2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hercules G. Dimopoulos|title=Analog Electronic Filters: Theory, Design and Synthesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6W1eX4QwtyYC&amp;pg=PA147|year=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2189-0|pages=147–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related concepts ==
The reciprocal of the arithmetic–geometric mean of 1 and the [[square root of 2]] is called [[Gauss's constant]], after [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{M(1, \sqrt{2})} = G = 0.8346268\dots&lt;/math&gt;

The [[geometric–harmonic mean]] can be calculated by an analogous method, using sequences of geometric and [[harmonic mean|harmonic]] means. The arithmetic–harmonic mean can be similarly defined, but takes the same value as the [[geometric mean]].

The arithmetic–geometric mean can be used to compute – among others – [[Logarithm#Arithmetic–geometric mean approximation|logarithms]],  [[Elliptic integral|complete and incomplete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind]],&lt;ref&gt;{{AS ref|17|598–599}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacobi elliptic functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Louis V. | last=King | url=https://archive.org/details/onthenumerical032686mbp | title=On The Direct Numerical Calculation Of Elliptic Functions And Integrals | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof of existence==
From the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]] we can conclude that:

:&lt;math&gt;g_n \leq a_n&lt;/math&gt;

and thus

:&lt;math&gt;g_{n + 1} = \sqrt{g_n \cdot a_n} \geq \sqrt{g_n \cdot g_n} = g_n&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the sequence {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is nondecreasing.

Furthermore, it is easy to see that it is also bounded above by the larger of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} (which follows from the fact that both the arithmetic and geometric means of two numbers lie between them). Thus, by the [[monotone convergence theorem]], the sequence is convergent, so there exists a {{math|''g''}} such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to \infty}g_n = g&lt;/math&gt;

However, we can also see that:

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = \frac{g_{n + 1}^2}{g_n}&lt;/math&gt;

and so:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to \infty}a_n = \lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{g_{n + 1}^2}{g_{n}} = \frac{g^2}{g} = g&lt;/math&gt;

[[Q.E.D.]]

==Proof of the integral-form expression==
This proof is given by Gauss.&lt;ref name="BerggrenBorwein2004" /&gt;
Let

:&lt;math&gt;I(x,y) = \int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{x^2\cos^2\theta+y^2\sin^2\theta}},&lt;/math&gt;

Changing the variable of integration to &lt;math&gt;\theta'&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt; \sin\theta = \frac{2x\sin\theta'}{(x+y)+(x-y)\sin^2\theta'}, &lt;/math&gt;

gives

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I(x,y) &amp;= \int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{d\theta'}{\sqrt{\bigl(\frac12(x+y)\bigr)^2\cos^2\theta'+\bigl(\sqrt{xy}\bigr)^2\sin^2\theta'}}\\
       &amp;= I\bigl(\tfrac12(x+y),\sqrt{xy}\bigr).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I(x,y) &amp;= I(a_1, g_1) = I(a_2, g_2) = \cdots\\
  &amp;= I\bigl(M(x,y),M(x,y)\bigr) = \pi/\bigr(2M(x,y)\bigl).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The last equality comes from observing that &lt;math&gt;I(z,z) = \pi/(2z)&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, we obtain the desired result

:&lt;math&gt;M(x,y) = \pi/\bigl(2 I(x,y) \bigr). &lt;/math&gt;

==The AGM method==
[[Gauss]] noticed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=B. C. Carlson |title=Algorithms involving arithmetic and geometric means |journal=Amer. Math. Monthly |volume=78 |year=1971 |pages=496–505 |doi=10.2307/2317754 |mr=0283246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=B. C.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a_0 &amp; &amp; b_0 \\
a_1 &amp; = \frac{a_0+b_0}{2}, &amp; b_1 &amp; = \sqrt{a_0 b_0} \\
a_2 &amp; = \frac{a_1+b_1}{2}, &amp; b_2 &amp; = \sqrt{a_1 b_1} \\

a_{N+1} &amp; = \frac{a_N + b_N}{2}, &amp; b_{N+1} &amp; = \sqrt{a_N b_N}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

as
: &lt;math&gt;N\to +\infty, &lt;/math&gt;

have the same limit:
: &lt;math&gt;
\lim_{N\to\infty}a_N = \lim_{N\to\infty}b_N = M(a,b),
&lt;/math&gt;
the arithmetic–geometric mean, ''agm''.

It is possible to use this fact to construct [[fast algorithms]] for calculating [[elementary function|elementary]] [[transcendental function]]s and some classical constants, in particular, the constant [[pi|{{pi}}]].

===Applications===

====The number ''π''====
For example, according to the Gauss–[[Eugene Salamin (mathematician)|Salamin]] formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Eugene Salamin (mathematician)|E. Salamin]] |title=Computation of π using arithmetic-geometric mean |journal=Math. Comp. |volume=30 |issue=135 |year=1976 |pages=565–570 |doi=10.2307/2005327 |mr=0404124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\pi = \frac{4 \left( M(1; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) \right)^2} {\displaystyle 1 - \sum_{j=1}^\infty 2^{j+1} c_j^2}
,
&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;c_j = \frac 12\left(a_{j-1}-b_{j-1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which can be computed without loss of precision using

: &lt;math&gt;c_j = \frac{c_{j-1}^2}{4a_j}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Complete elliptic integral ''K''(sin''α'')====
Taking &lt;math&gt;
a_0 = 1, \quad b_0 = \cos\alpha
&lt;/math&gt; ,     yields the ''agm'',
: &lt;math&gt;
\lim_{N\to\infty}a_N = \frac{\pi}{2K(\sin \alpha)}~,
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''K''(''k'')}} is a complete [[elliptic integral|elliptic integral of the first kind]],
:&lt;math&gt;
K(k) = \int_0^{\pi/2}(1 - k^2 \sin^2\theta)^{-1/2} \, d\theta ~.
&lt;/math&gt;
That is to say that this [[quarter period]] may be efficiently computed through the ''agm'',
:&lt;math&gt;
K(k) =  \frac{\pi}{2~M(1,\sqrt{1-k^2})} ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

====Other applications====

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14877">In [[finance]], the '''binomial options pricing model''' (BOPM) provides a generalizable [[Numerical analysis|numerical method]] for the valuation of [[Option (finance)|options]]. The binomial model was first proposed by [[John Carrington Cox|Cox]], [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Ross]] and [[Mark Rubinstein|Rubinstein]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=J.

In general, [[Evangelos Georgiadis (mathematician)|Georgiadis]] showed that binomial options pricing models do not have [[Closed-form expression|closed-form solutions]].&lt;ref name="BinomialArticle"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Georgiadis |first1=Evangelos | authorlink1=Evangelos Georgiadis (mathematician) |year=2011 |title=Binomial options pricing has no closed-form solution |journal=Algorithmic Finance |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–16 |publisher=IOS Press |doi=10.3233/AF-2011-003 |ssrn=1773170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the model==
The Binomial options pricing model approach has been widely used since it is able to handle a variety of conditions for which other models cannot easily be applied. This is largely because the BOPM is based on the description of an [[underlying instrument]] over a period of time rather than a single point.  As a consequence, it is used to value [[American option]]s that are exercisable at any time in a given interval as well as [[Bermudan option]]s that are exercisable at specific instances of time.  Being relatively simple, the model is readily implementable in computer [[software]] (including a [[spreadsheet]]).

Although computationally slower than the [[Black–Scholes model|Black–Scholes formula]], it is more accurate, particularly for longer-dated options on securities with [[dividend]] payments. For these reasons, various versions of the binomial model are widely used by practitioners in the options markets.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

For options with several sources of uncertainty (e.g., [[real option]]s) and for options with complicated features (e.g., [[Asian option]]s), binomial methods are less practical due to several difficulties, and [[Monte Carlo option model]]s are commonly used instead. When simulating a small number of time steps [[Monte Carlo simulation]] will be more computationally time-consuming than BOPM (cf. [[Monte Carlo methods in finance]]). However, the worst-case runtime of BOPM will be [[Exponential time|O(2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)]], where n is the number of time steps in the simulation. Monte Carlo simulations will generally have a [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial time complexity]], and will be faster for large numbers of simulation steps. [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s are also less susceptible to sampling errors, since binomial techniques use discrete time units. This becomes more true the smaller the discrete units become.

==Method==
[[File:Arbre Binomial Options Reelles.png|right|Binomial Lattice with CRR formulae]]
The binomial pricing model traces the evolution of the option's key underlying variables in discrete-time.  This is done by means of a binomial lattice (tree), for a number of time steps between the valuation and expiration dates.  Each node in the lattice represents a possible price of the underlying at a given point in time.

Valuation is performed iteratively, starting at each of the final nodes (those that may be reached at the time of expiration), and then [[Backward induction|working backwards]] through the tree towards the first node (valuation date).  The value computed at each stage is the value of the option at that point in time.

Option valuation using this method is, as described, a three-step process:
# price tree generation,
# calculation of option value at each final node,
# sequential calculation of the option value at each preceding node.

===Step 1: Create the binomial price tree===
The tree of prices is produced by working forward from valuation date to expiration.

At each step, it is assumed that the [[underlying instrument]] will move up or down by a specific factor (&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) per step of the tree (where, by definition, &lt;math&gt;u \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; d \le 1 &lt;/math&gt;). So, if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the current price, then in the next period the price will either be &lt;math&gt;S_{up} = S \cdot u&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;S_{down} = S \cdot d&lt;/math&gt;.

The up and down factors are calculated using the underlying [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]], &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and the time duration of a step, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, measured in years (using the [[day count convention]] of the underlying instrument). From the condition that the [[variance]] of the log of the price is &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 t&lt;/math&gt;, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;u = e^{\sigma\sqrt t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d = e^{-\sigma\sqrt t} = \frac{1}{u}.&lt;/math&gt;

Above is the original Cox, Ross, &amp; Rubinstein (CRR) method; there are other techniques for generating the lattice, such as "the equal probabilities" tree. The [[Trinomial tree]] is a similar model, allowing for an up, down or stable path.

The CRR method ensures that the tree is recombinant, i.e. if the underlying asset moves up and then down (u,d), the price will be the same as if it had moved down and then up (d,u)—here the two paths merge or recombine. This property reduces the number of tree nodes, and thus accelerates the computation of the option price.

This property also allows that the value of the underlying asset at each node can be calculated directly via formula, and does not require that the tree be built first. The node-value will be:
:&lt;math&gt;S_n = S_0 \times u ^{N_u - N_d}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;N_u&lt;/math&gt; is the number of up ticks and &lt;math&gt;N_d&lt;/math&gt; is the number of down ticks.

===Step 2: Find Option value at each final node===
At each final node of the tree—i.e. at expiration of the option—the option value is simply its [[option time value|intrinsic]], or exercise, value.

:[[Extreme value|Max]] [ (&lt;math&gt;S_n-K&lt;/math&gt;), 0 ], for a [[call option]]
:Max [ (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; − &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;), 0 ], for a [[put option]]:

Where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the [[strike price]] and &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is the spot price of the underlying asset at the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; period.

===Step 3: Find Option value at earlier nodes===
Once the above step is complete, the option value is then found for each node, starting at the penultimate time step, and working back to the first node of the tree (the valuation date) where the calculated result is the value of the option.

In overview: the "binomial value" is found at each node, using the [[risk-neutral measure|risk neutrality]] assumption; see [[Rational pricing#Risk neutral valuation|Risk neutral valuation]]. If exercise is permitted at the node, then the model takes the greater of binomial and exercise value at the node.

The steps are as follows:

'''(1)''' Under the risk neutrality assumption, today's [[fair value|fair price]] of a [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] is equal to the [[expected value]] of its future payoff discounted by the [[Risk-free interest rate|risk free rate]]. Therefore, expected value is calculated using the option values from the later two nodes (''Option up'' and ''Option down'') weighted by their respective probabilities—"probability" '''p''' of an up move in the underlying, and "probability" '''(1−p)''' of a down move. The expected value is then discounted at '''r''', the [[Risk-free interest rate|risk free rate]] corresponding to the life of the option.

:The following formula to compute the [[expectation value]] is applied at each node:

:Binomial Value = [ p × Option up  + (1−p) × Option down] × exp (- r × Δt), or

:&lt;math&gt;C_{t-\Delta t,i} = e^{-r \Delta t}(pC_{t,i} + (1-p)C_{t,i+1}) \,&lt;/math&gt;

:where
:&lt;math&gt;C_{t,i} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the option's value for the &lt;math&gt;i^{th} \,&lt;/math&gt; node at time &lt;math&gt;{t} \,&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{e^{(r-q) \Delta t} - d}{u - d}&lt;/math&gt; is chosen such that the related [[binomial distribution]] simulates the [[geometric Brownian motion]] of the underlying stock with parameters '''r''' and '''σ''',

:&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dividend yield]] of the underlying corresponding to the life of the option. It follows that in a risk-neutral world futures price should have an expected growth rate of zero and therefore we can consider &lt;math&gt;q=r&lt;/math&gt; for futures.

:Note that for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to be in the interval &lt;math&gt;(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; the following condition on &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; has to be satisfied &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &lt; \frac{\sigma^2}{(r-q)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

:(Note that the alternative valuation approach, [[arbitrage-free]] pricing, yields identical results; see “[[Rational pricing#Delta hedging|delta-hedging]]”.)

'''(2)''' This result is the "Binomial Value". It represents the fair price of the derivative at a particular point in time (i.e. at each node), given the evolution in the price of the underlying to that point. It is the value of the option if it were to be held—as opposed to exercised at that point.

'''(3)''' Depending on the style of the option, evaluate the possibility of early exercise at each node: if (1) the option can be exercised, and (2) the exercise value exceeds the Binomial Value, then (3) the value at the node is the exercise value.
* For a [[European option]], there is no option of early exercise, and the binomial value applies at all nodes.
* For an [[American option]], since the option may either be held or exercised prior to expiry, the value at each node is: Max (Binomial Value, Exercise Value).
* For a [[Bermudan option]], the value at nodes where early exercise is allowed is: Max (Binomial Value, Exercise Value); at nodes where early exercise is not allowed, only the binomial value applies.

In calculating the value at the next time step calculated—i.e. one step closer to valuation—the model must use the value selected here, for “Option up”/“Option down” as appropriate, in the formula at the node.&lt;code&gt;The following [[algorithm]] demonstrates the approach computing the price of an American put option, although is easily generalized for calls and for European and Bermudan options:
 '''function''' americanPut(T, S, K, r, sigma, q, n) {
     '        T... expiration time
     '        S... stock price
     '        K... strike price
     '        q... dividend yield
     '        n... height of the binomial tree
    
     deltaT := T / n;
     up := exp(sigma * sqrt(deltaT));
    
     p0 := (up*exp(-q * deltaT) - exp(-r * deltaT)) / (up^2 - 1);
     p1 := exp(-r * deltaT) - p0;
    
     ' initial values at time T
     '''for''' i := 0 '''to''' n {
         p[i] := K - S * up^(2*i - n);
         '''if''' p[i] &lt; 0 '''then''' p[i] := 0;
     }
    
     ' move to earlier times
     '''for''' j := n-1 '''down to''' 0 {
         '''for''' i := 0 '''to''' j {
             p[i] := p0 * p[i+1] + p1 * p[i];    ' binomial value
             exercise := K - S * up^(2*i - j);  ' exercise value
             '''if''' p[i] &lt; exercise '''then''' p[i] := exercise;
         }
     }
    
     '''return''' americanPut := p[0];
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

==Relationship with Black–Scholes==
Similar [[Black–Scholes#The model|assumptions]] underpin both the binomial model and the [[Black–Scholes|Black–Scholes model]], and the binomial model thus provides a [[Discrete time and continuous time|discrete time]] [[approximation]] to the continuous process underlying the Black–Scholes model. In fact, for [[European option]]s without dividends, the binomial model value converges on the Black–Scholes formula value as the number of time steps increases. The binomial model assumes that movements in the price follow a [[binomial distribution]]; for many trials, this binomial distribution approaches the [[lognormal distribution]] assumed by Black–Scholes.

In addition, when analyzed as a numerical procedure, the CRR binomial method can be viewed as a [[special case]] of the [[Finite difference method#Explicit method|explicit finite difference method]] for the Black–Scholes [[Partial differential equation|PDE]]; see [[finite difference methods for option pricing]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 2011, Georgiadis shows that the binomial options pricing model has a lower bound on complexity that rules out a [[Closed-form expression|closed-form solution]].&lt;ref name="BinomialArticle" /&gt;

In [[Operations Research]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[theoretical computer science]], '''combinatorial optimization''' &lt;!-- synonymous or subfield?: '''discrete optimization'''{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}--&gt; is a topic that consists of finding an optimal object from a [[finite set]] of objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schrijver|2006|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In many such problems, [[exhaustive search]] is not tractable. It operates on the domain of those optimization problems, in which the set of [[Candidate solution|feasible solutions]] is [[Discrete set|discrete]] or can be reduced to discrete, and in which the goal is to find the best solution.  Some common problems involving combinatorial optimization are the [[travelling salesman problem]] ("TSP") and the [[minimum spanning tree|minimum spanning tree problem]] ("MST").

Combinatorial optimization is a subset of [[mathematical optimization]] that is related to [[operations research]], [[algorithm|algorithm theory]], and [[computational complexity theory]]. It has important applications in several fields, including [[artificial intelligence]], [[machine learning]], [[auction theory]], and [[software engineering]].

Some research literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Discrete Optimization | url=http://www.elsevier.com/locate/disopt | publisher=Elsevier |  accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; considers [[discrete optimization]] to consist of [[integer programming]] together with combinatorial optimization (which in turn is composed of [[optimization problem]]s dealing with [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph structures]]) although all of these topics have closely intertwined research literature. It often involves determining the way to efficiently allocate resources used to find solutions to mathematical problems.

==Applications==
Applications for combinatorial optimization include, but are not limited to:

* Developing the best airline network of spokes and destinations
* Deciding which taxis in a fleet to route to pick up fares
* Determining the optimal way to deliver packages
* Working out the best allocation of jobs to people
* Determining the right attributes of concept elements prior to [[concept testing]]{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
* [[Logistics]]&lt;ref&gt;Sbihi, Abdelkader, and Richard W. Eglese. "[https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/64/40/76/PDF/COGL_4or.pdf Combinatorial optimization and green logistics]." 4OR 5.2 (2007): 99-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
There is a large amount of literature on [[polynomial-time algorithm]]s for certain special classes of discrete optimization, a considerable amount of it unified by the theory of [[linear programming]]. Some examples of combinatorial optimization problems that fall into this framework are [[shortest path]]s and [[shortest path tree]]s, [[flow network|flows and circulations]], [[spanning tree]]s, [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]], and [[matroid]] problems.

For [[NP-complete]] discrete optimization problems, current research literature includes the following topics:
* polynomial-time exactly solvable special cases of the problem at hand (e.g. see [[fixed-parameter tractable]])
* algorithms that perform well on "random" instances (e.g. for [[Traveling salesman problem#TSP path length for random pointset in a square|TSP]])
* [[approximation algorithm]]s that run in polynomial time and find a solution that is "close" to optimal

Combinatorial optimization problems can be viewed as searching for the best element of some set of discrete items; therefore, in principle, any sort of [[search algorithm]] or [[metaheuristic]] can be used to solve them. However, generic search algorithms are not guaranteed to find an optimal solution, nor are they guaranteed to run quickly (in polynomial time). Since some discrete optimization problems are [[NP-complete]], such as the traveling salesman problem, this is expected unless [[P=NP]].

'''Copying network models''' are network generation models that use a [[copying mechanism]] to form a network, by repeatedly duplicating and mutating existing nodes of the network. Such a network model has first been proposed in 1999 to explain the network of links between web pages, but since has been used to model biological and citation networks as well.

== Origins ==
In 1999 Jon Kleinberg and 3 co-authors published an article to &lt;i&gt;Computing and combinatorics&lt;/i&gt; attempting to construct a network model that explains patterns found in an analysis of the [[world wide web]]. The intuition behind the model was that when a user decides to build and publish her own web page, she encounters a list of links for her topic of interest on the web and ends up copying this collection, or many such collections to her own web page. This creating a new node in the network - the new page - and &lt;i&gt;copying&lt;/i&gt; edges from already existing nodes in some fashion.

They outlined a model very generally, but didn't analyse the predictions of an exact model in detail, mostly due to computational limitations, but suggested that copying nodes randomly is a simple, model worthy mechanism for creating [[Zipfian distribution]] networks.
&lt;ref name=klein&gt;{{citation|first=Jon|last=Kleinberg|journal=Computing and combinatorics|pages=1-17|year=1999|title=The web as a graph: measurements, models, and methods.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This paper since, has been cited over 1200 times, which is a number comparable to significant papers contributing to network science, like the one describing the [[Erdős–Rényi model]] (about 8300) and includes notable network science books like Mark Newman's&lt;ref name=newman&gt;{{citation|first=Mark|last=Newman|year=2003|title=The structure and function of complex networks.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

=== General model ===

To understand a general model, take a basic network growth model, which is characterized by four stochastic processes. Creation processes &lt;math&gt;C_v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_e&lt;/math&gt; for node- and edge-creation, and deletion processes &lt;math&gt;D_v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_e&lt;/math&gt; for node- and edge-deletion.

Take a discrete time timeframe, where &lt;math&gt;C_v&lt;/math&gt; consists of simply at each step, creating a node with probability &lt;math&gt;a_c(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and similarly &lt;math&gt;D_v&lt;/math&gt; is deleting a node with probability ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''). Consequently, this also means &lt;math&gt;D_e&lt;/math&gt; includes removing all edges that belonged to a node that was removed.

&lt;math&gt;C_e&lt;/math&gt; is where the essence of the copying model is. In the original article, they characterize &lt;math&gt;C_e&lt;/math&gt; with a probability distribution, that determines a node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to add edges out of, and a number of edges &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; that will be added. And with probability &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; that the ''k'' edges are either copied or added randomly. With probability &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, all &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; edges from v are drawn to nodes chosen independently and uniformly at random. With probability &lt;math&gt;(1 - \beta )&lt;/math&gt;, the ''k'' edges are copied from a randomly chosen node &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. Meaning that &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; neighbours of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; become neighbours of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; has a degree higher than &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; edges are selected randomly and if it has a lower degree &lt;math&gt;l &lt; k&lt;/math&gt;, a next node is randomly selected and &lt;math&gt;k - l&lt;/math&gt; of its edges are copied, and so on.

It can be shown, that such a network produces a power law degree distribution, with an exponent &lt;math&gt; \gamma = &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;  \frac{2 - a}{1 - a} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of number of the randomly added edges to the number of the copied edges. &lt;ref name=kumar&gt;{{citation|first=Ravi|last=Kumar|year=2000|title=Stochastic models for the web graph.|journal=Foundations of Computer Science}}.&lt;/ref&gt; So with a ratio between zero and 0.5 a power law distribution with an exponent of &lt;math&gt; 2 &lt; \gamma &lt; 3 &lt;/math&gt; can be achieved. Also note that as the ratio approaches 1, the exponent goes to infinity.

====GNC model====

Another simple model, proposed to explain the observation that the average node degree grows with system size adds nodes one at a time. A new node randomly selects a node from the existing ones and in addition to copying all the edges the target node was assigned at its introduction, it connects to the node itself, thus slightly increasing average degree. For example if the target node is the very first one in the network, no additional edges are added, just the one between the first node and the last. Take the two extreme cases. If a new node always connects to the first node, the model forms a [[star graph]], where each node has degree one, but the first node has increasing degree count. In this case, the average degree increases by &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{N}&lt;/math&gt; with each additional node, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of nodes. In the other extreme case, where the new nodes connects to the one added before it, a complete graph is formed and the average degree increases 1 with every new node.
&lt;ref name=krapivsky&gt;{{citation|first=Pavel L|last=Krapivsky|first2=Sidney|last2=Redner|year=2005|title=Network growth by copying.|journal=Physical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Walking model====

A copying model that is somewhat of a mixture of the two was introduced by Vazquez. In this model, a when a new node is added, it connects to one randomly selected node that is already present in the network, and to each of its neighbors with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; possibility. So with &lt;math&gt;p = 0&lt;/math&gt; this graph creates a chain and &lt;math&gt;p = 1&lt;/math&gt; creates a complete graph. Depending on &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; this graph can produce a number of power-law degree distributions with certain cutoffs that characterize real world networks well.
&lt;ref name=alexei&gt;{{citation|first=Alexei L|last=Vazquez|year=2000|title=Knowing a network by walking on it: emergence of scaling.|journal=preprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological networks==

There has been considerable interest in modeling biological networks, such as protein interaction networks and genetic regulatory networks using copying network models. Genes that contain information about how a node in a network should interact with others tend to duplicate in evolution, thus duplicating the edges that were present in the network. Also, [[preferential attachment]] networks can not really model biological networks well, both because they are not plausible, and because a number of biological networks have power law degree distribution with exponent &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt; 2 &lt;/math&gt; which is not produced by such prefernital network models.

Take a node duplication process, in which initially each node has equal probability of being duplicated in a single time step. However, the probability of duplication is influenced by the history of prior duplications, and not all edges get duplicated, only a randomly selected subset of them. Such a partial duplication model,  can  produce  power-law  distributions with  exponents &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt; 2 &lt;/math&gt;, consistent  with  the degree distribution of a number of biological networks, regardless of the starting graph.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{citation|first=Fan|last=Chung|year=2003|title=Duplication models for biological networks.|journal=Journal of computational biology|pages=677-687}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Physical chemistry}}

In '''physical chemistry''', there are numerous quantities associated with [[chemical compounds]] and [[Chemical reaction|reactions]]; notably in terms of ''amounts'' of substance, ''activity'' or ''concentration'' of a substance, and the ''rate'' of reaction. This article uses [[SI units]].

==Introduction==

[[Theoretical chemistry]] requires [[physical quantity|quantities]] from core [[physics]], such as [[time]], [[volume]], [[temperature]], and [[pressure]]. But the highly quantitative nature of physical chemistry, in a more specialized way than core physics, uses [[Amount of substance|molar amounts of substance]] rather than simply counting numbers; this leads to the specialized definitions in this article. Core physics itself rarely uses the mole, except in areas overlapping [[thermodynamics]] and [[chemistry]].

==Notes on nomenclature==

''Entity'' refers to the type of particle/s in question, such as [[atoms]], [[molecules]], [[Coordination complex|complex]]es, [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]], [[ions]], [[electrons]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://goldbook.iupac.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventionally for [[concentrations]] and [[Activity (chemistry)|activities]], square brackets [ ] are used around the [[Chemical formula|chemical molecular formula]]. For an arbitrary atom, generic letters in upright non-bold typeface such as A, B, R, X or Y etc. are often used.

No standard symbols are used for the following quantities, as specifically applied to a [[Matter|substance]]:

* the [[mass]] of a substance ''m'',
* the number of moles of the substance ''n'',
* [[partial pressure]] of a gas in a gaseous mixture ''p'' (or ''P''),
* some form of [[energy]] of a substance (for chemistry [[enthalpy]] ''H'' is common),
* [[entropy]] of a substance ''S''
* the [[electronegativity]] of an atom or [[chemical bond]] ''χ''.

Usually the symbol for the quantity with a subscript of some reference to the quantity is used, or the quantity is written with the reference to the chemical in round brackets. For example, the mass of [[water]] might be written in subscripts as ''m''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;water&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;aq&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; (if clear from context) etc., or simply as ''m''(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Another example could be the electronegativity of the [[fluorine]]-fluorine [[covalent bond]], which might be written with subscripts ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;F-F&lt;/sub&gt;, ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;FF&lt;/sub&gt; or ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;F-F&lt;/sub&gt; etc., or brackets ''χ''(F-F), ''χ''(FF) etc.

Neither is standard. For the purpose of this article, the nomenclature is as follows, closely (but not exactly) matching standard use.

For general equations with no specific reference to an entity, quantities are written as their symbols with an index to label the component of the mixture - i.e. ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. The labeling is arbitrary in initial choice, but once chosen fixed for the calculation.

If any reference to an actual entity (say hydrogen ions H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or any entity at all (say X) is made, the quantity symbol ''q'' is followed by curved ( ) brackets enclosing the molecular formula of X, i.e. ''q''(X), or for a component ''i'' of a mixture ''q''(X&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;). No confusion should arise with the notation for a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]].

==Kinetics and equilibria==

The defining formulae for the [[equilibrium constants]] ''K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' (all reactions) and ''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' (gaseous reactions) apply to the general chemical reaction:

:&lt;chem&gt; {\nu_1 X1} + {\nu_2 X2} + \cdots + \nu_\mathit{r} X_\mathit{r} &lt;=&gt; {\eta_1 Y1} + {\eta_2 Y2} + \cdots + \eta_\mathit{p} {Y}_\mathit{p}&lt;/chem&gt;

and the defining equation for the [[rate constant]] ''k'' applies to the simpler synthesis reaction (one [[Product (chemistry)|product]] only):

:&lt;chem&gt; {\nu_1 X1} + {\nu_2 X2} + \cdots + \nu_\mathit{r} X_\mathit{r} -&gt; \eta {Y} &lt;/chem&gt;

where:

*''i'' = dummy index labelling component ''i'' of [[Reagent|reactant]] mixture,
*''j'' = dummy index labelling component ''i'' of [[Product (chemistry)|product]] mixture,
*X&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = component ''i'' of the reactant mixture,
*Y&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = reactant component ''j'' of the product mixture,
*''r'' (as an index) = number of reactant components, 
*''p'' (as an index) = number of product components, 
*''ν&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = [[stoichiometry]] number for component ''i'' in product mixture,  
*''η&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = stoichiometry number for component ''j'' in product mixture,  
*''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = [[order of reaction]] for component ''i'' in reactant mixture.

The dummy indices on the substances ''X'' and ''Y'' ''label'' the components (arbitrary but fixed for calculation); they are not the ''numbers'' of each component molecules as in usual [[Chemical formula|chemistry notation]].

The units for the chemical constants are unusual since they can vary depending on the stoichiometry of the reaction, and the number of reactant and product components. The general units for equilibrium constants can be determined by usual methods of [[dimensional analysis]]. For the generality of the kinetics and equilibria units below, let the indices for the units be;

:&lt;math&gt;S_1 = \sum_{j=1}^p \eta_j - \sum_{i=1}^r \nu_i \,,\quad\, S_2 = 1-\sum_{i=1}^{r} \sigma_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For the constant ''K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'';

Substitute the concentration units into the equation and simplify:,

:&lt;math chem&gt;
\begin{align}
K_c &amp; = \frac{\prod_{j=1}^p \left [ \ce Y_j \right ]^{y_j}}{\prod_{i=1}^r \left [ \ce X_i \right ]^{x_i} } \\
\left[K_c\right] &amp; = \frac{\prod_{j=1}^p [\ce M]^{y_j}}{\prod_{i=1}^r [\ce M]^{x_i} }  \\
 &amp; = \frac{[\ce M]^{y_1} [\ce M]^{y_2} \cdots [\ce M]^{y_p}}{[\ce M]^{x_1} [\ce M]^{x_2} \cdots [\ce M]^{x_r} }  \\
 &amp; = \frac{[\ce M]^{\sum_{j=1}^p y_j}}{[\ce M]^{\sum_{i=1}^r x_i} }  \\
 &amp; = [\ce M]^{\sum_{j=1}^p y_j - \sum_{i=1}^r x_i}
\end{align}
\ 
(\ce{M = mol \; dm^{-3}})&lt;/math&gt;

The procedure is exactly identical for ''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''.

For the constant ''k''

:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
k &amp; = \frac{\frac{\mathrm{d}[\ce Y]}{\mathrm{d}t}}{\prod_{i=1}^{r}\left[ \ce X_i \right]^{\sigma_i}} \\
\left[k\right] &amp; = \frac{[\ce M]s^{-1}}{\prod_{i=1}^{r}[\ce M]^{\sigma_i}} \\
 &amp; = \frac{[\ce M]s^{-1}}{[\ce M]^{\sum_{i=1}^{r} \sigma_i}} \\
 &amp; = [\ce M]^{1-\sum_{i=1}^{r} \sigma_i} s^{-1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Electrochemistry==

Notation for [[half-reaction]] [[standard electrode potential]]s is as follows. The [[Redox|redox reaction]]

:&lt;chem&gt; A + BX &lt;=&gt; B + AX &lt;/chem&gt;

split into:

a [[Redox|reduction reaction]]: &lt;chem&gt; B+ + e^- &lt;=&gt; B &lt;/chem&gt;

and an [[Redox|oxidation reaction]]: &lt;chem&gt; A+ + e^- &lt;=&gt; A &lt;/chem&gt;

(written this way by convention) the electrode potential for the half reactions are written as &lt;math chem&gt;E^\ominus\left(\ce{A+} \vert \ce{A} \right) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math chem&gt; E^\ominus\left( \ce{B+} \vert \ce{B} \right) &lt;/math&gt; respectively.

For the case of a metal-metal half electrode, letting M represent the [[metal]] and ''z'' be its [[Valence (chemistry)|valency]], the half reaction takes the form of a reduction reaction:

:&lt;chem&gt; {M^{+\mathit{z}}} + \mathit{z} e^- &lt;=&gt; M&lt;/chem&gt;

In [[mathematical modeling]], [[statistical model]]ing and [[experimental science]]s, the values of '''dependent [[Variable and attribute (research)|variables]]''' depend on the values of '''independent variables'''. The dependent variables represent the output or outcome whose variation is being studied. The independent variables, also known in a statistical context as '''regressors''', represent inputs or causes, that is, potential reasons for variation. In an experiment, any variable that the experimenter manipulates can be called an independent variable.  Models and experiments test the effects that the independent variables have on the dependent variables. Sometimes, even if their influence is not of direct interest, independent variables may be included for other reasons, such as to account for their potential [[confounding]] effect.[[File:Polynomialdeg2.svg|thumb|In single variable [[calculus]], a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is typically [[graph of a function|graphed]] with the [[horizontal axis]] representing the independent variable and the [[vertical axis]] representing the dependent variable.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, Nancy Baxter. Workshop calculus: guided exploration with review. Vol. 2. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1998. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In this function, ''y'' is the dependent variable and ''x'' is the independent variable.]]

==Mathematics==

In mathematics, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is a rule for taking an input (in the simplest case, a number or set of numbers)&lt;ref name=carlson&gt;Carlson, Robert. A concrete introduction to real analysis. CRC Press, 2006. p.183&lt;/ref&gt; and providing an output (which may also be a number).&lt;ref name=carlson/&gt; A symbol that stands for an arbitrary input is called an '''independent variable''', while a symbol that stands for an arbitrary output is called a '''dependent variable'''.&lt;ref name=stewart&gt;Stewart, James. Calculus. Cengage Learning, 2011. Section 1.1&lt;/ref&gt; The most common symbol for the input is ''x'', and the most common symbol for the output is ''y''; the function itself is commonly written &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anton, Howard, Irl C. Bivens, and Stephen Davis. Calculus Single Variable. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012. Section 0.1&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to have multiple independent variables or multiple dependent variables. For instance, in [[multivariable calculus]], one often encounters functions of the form &lt;math&gt;z=f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''z'' is a dependent variable and ''x'' and ''y'' are independent variables.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Ron, and Bruce Edwards. Calculus. Cengage Learning, 2009. Section 13.1&lt;/ref&gt; Functions with multiple outputs are often referred to as [[vector-valued functions]].

In [[set theory]], a function between a [[set (mathematics)|set]] '''X''' and a set '''Y''' is a  [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;X\times Y&lt;/math&gt; such that every element of '''X''' appears in an ordered pair with exactly one element of '''Y'''. In this situation, a symbol representing an element of '''X''' may be called an independent variable and a symbol representing an element of '''Y''' may be called a dependent variable, such as when '''X''' is a [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]] and the symbol ''x'' represents an arbitrary point in the manifold.&lt;ref&gt;Hrbacek, Karel, and Thomas Jech. Introduction to Set Theory, Revised and Expanded. Vol. 220. Crc Press, 1999. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; However, many advanced textbooks do not distinguish between dependent and independent variables.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, a Google Books search for "independent variable" on Mar 18, 2015 brought up 0 hits in the following advanced textbooks:
*Munkres, James R. Topology: a first course. Vol. 23. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975.
*Hungerford, Thomas. Abstract algebra: an introduction. Cengage Learning, 2012.
*Abbott, Stephen. Understanding analysis. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===
In an [[design of experiments|experiment]], a variable, manipulated by an experimenter, is called an independent variable.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinestatbook.com/2/introduction/variables.html&lt;/ref&gt; The dependent variable is the event expected to change when the independent variable is manipulated.&lt;ref name="randomHouse"&gt;''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.'' Random House, Inc. 2001. Page 534, 971. {{ISBN|0-375-42566-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[data mining]]  tools (for [[multivariate statistics]] and [[machine learning]]), the dependent variable is assigned a ''role'' as '''{{visible anchor|target variable}}''' (or in some tools as ''label attribute''), while an independent variable may be assigned a role as ''regular variable''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1xltkxylmzx3z8gd647akcdvov.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rapidminer-5.0-manual-english_v1.0.pdf English Manual version 1.0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210002634/http://1xltkxylmzx3z8gd647akcdvov.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rapidminer-5.0-manual-english_v1.0.pdf |date=2014-02-10 }} for [[RapidMiner]] 5.0, October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Known values for the target variable are provided for the training data set and [[test data]] set, but should be predicted for other data. The target variable is used in [[supervised learning]] algorithms but not in unsupervised learning.

===Modeling===
In [[mathematical modeling]], the dependent variable is studied to see if and how much it varies as the independent variables vary. In the simple [[stochastic]] [[linear model]] &lt;math&gt;y_i = a + bx_i + e_i&lt;/math&gt; the term &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i'' &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; value of the dependent variable and &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i'' &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; value of the independent variable. The term &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; is known as the "error" and contains the variability of the dependent variable not explained by the independent variable.

With multiple independent variables, the model is &lt;math&gt;y_i = a + bx_{1,i} + bx_{2,i} + ... + bx_{n,i} + e_i&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n'' is the number of independent variables.

===Simulation===
In [[simulation]], the dependent variable is changed in response to changes in the independent variables.

==Statistics synonyms==
Depending on the context, an independent variable is sometimes called a "predictor variable", '''regressor''', '''covariate''', "controlled variable", "manipulated variable", "explanatory variable", '''exposure variable''' (see [[reliability theory]]), "[[risk factor]]" (see [[medical statistics]]), "[[Feature (machine learning)|feature]]" (in [[machine learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]) or "input variable."&lt;ref name="Dodgeindepvar"&gt;Dodge, Y.

(2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}} (entry for "regression")&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[econometrics]], the term "control variable" is usually used instead of "covariate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gujarati |first=Damodar N. |last2=Porter |first2=Dawn C. |title=Basic Econometrics |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2009 |edition=Fifth international |isbn=978-007-127625-2 |chapter=Terminology and Notation |pages=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wooldridge |first=Jeffrey |year=2012 |title=Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach |location=Mason, OH |publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning |edition=Fifth |isbn=978-1-111-53104-1 |pages=22–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the context, a dependent variable is sometimes called a "response variable", "regressand", "criterion", "predicted variable", "measured variable", "explained variable", "experimental variable", "responding variable", "outcome variable", "output variable" or "label".&lt;ref name="Dodgeregression"/&gt;

"Explanatory variable"{{anchor|explanatory variable}} is preferred by some authors over "independent variable" when the quantities treated as independent variables may not be statistically independent or independently manipulable by the researcher.&lt;ref name="Everitt1"&gt;Everitt, B.S. (2002) Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics, CUP. {{ISBN|0-521-81099-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodge1"&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the independent variable is referred to as an "explanatory variable" then the term "response variable"{{anchor|response variable}} is preferred by some authors for the dependent variable.&lt;ref name="Dodgeregression"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Everitt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodge1"/&gt;

"Explained variable"{{anchor|explained variable}} is preferred by some authors over "dependent variable" when the quantities treated as "dependent variables" may not be statistically dependent.&lt;ref name="DAUME"&gt;Ash Narayan Sah (2009) Data Analysis Using Microsoft Excel, New Delhi. {{ISBN|978-81-7446-716-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the dependent variable is referred to as an "explained variable" then the term "predictor variable"{{anchor|predictor variable}} is preferred by some authors for the independent variable.&lt;ref name="DAUME"/&gt;

Variables may also be referred to by their form: continuous, binary/dichotomous, nominal categorical, and ordinal categorical, among others.

An example is provided by the analysis of trend in sea level by {{Harvtxt|Woodworth|1987}}. Here the [[dependent variable]] (and variable of most interest) was the annual mean sea level at a given location for which a series of yearly values were available. The primary independent variable was time. Use was made of a covariate consisting of yearly values of annual mean atmospheric pressure at sea level. The results showed that inclusion of the covariate allowed improved estimates of the trend against time to be obtained, compared to analyses which omitted the covariate.

==Other variables==
A variable may be thought to alter the dependent or independent variables, but may not actually be the focus of the experiment. So that variable will be kept constant or monitored to try to minimize its effect on the experiment. Such variables may be designated as either a "controlled variable", "[[control variable]]", or "extraneous variable".

Extraneous variables, if included in a regression analysis as independent variables, may aid a researcher with accurate response parameter estimation, [[prediction]], and [[goodness of fit]], but are not of substantive interest to the [[hypothesis]] under examination. For example, in a study examining the effect of post-secondary education on lifetime earnings, some extraneous variables might be gender, ethnicity, social class, genetics, intelligence, age, and so forth. A variable is extraneous only when it can be assumed (or shown) to influence the [[dependent variable]]. If included in a regression, it can improve the fit of the model. If it is excluded from the regression and if it has a non-zero [[covariance]] with one or more of the independent variables of interest, its omission will [[bias (statistics)|bias]] the regression's result for the effect of that independent variable of interest. This effect is called [[confounding]] or [[omitted variable bias]]; in these situations, design changes and/or controlling for a variable statistical control is necessary.

Extraneous variables are often classified into three types:
#Subject variables, which are the characteristics of the individuals being studied that might affect their actions. These variables include age, gender, health status, mood, background, etc.
#Blocking variables or experimental variables are characteristics of the persons conducting the experiment which might influence how a person behaves. Gender, the presence of racial discrimination, language, or other factors may qualify as such variables.
#Situational variables are features of the environment in which the study or research was conducted, which have a bearing on the outcome of the experiment in a negative way. Included are the air temperature, level of activity, lighting, and the time of day.

In modelling, variability that is not covered by the independent variable is designated by &lt;math&gt;e_I&lt;/math&gt; and is known as the "[[errors and residuals|residual]]", "side effect", "[[errors and residuals|error]]", "unexplained share", "residual variable", or "tolerance".

==Examples==
* Effect of fertilizer on plant growth
: In a study measuring the influence of different quantities of fertilizer on plant growth, the independent variable would be the amount of fertilizer used. The dependent variable would be the growth in height or mass of the plant. The controlled variables would be the type of plant, the type of fertilizer, the amount of sunlight the plant gets, the size of the pots, etc.
* Effect of drug dosage on symptom severity
: In a study of how different doses of a drug affect the severity of symptoms, a researcher could compare the frequency and intensity of symptoms when different doses are administered. Here the independent variable is the dose and the dependent variable is the frequency/intensity of symptoms.
* Effect of temperature on pigmentation
: In measuring the amount of color removed from beetroot samples at different temperatures, temperature is the independent variable and amount of pigment removed is the dependent variable.

'''Distributed Tree Search''' (DTS) algorithm is a class of algorithms for searching values in an efficient and distributed manner. Their purpose is to iterate through a tree by working along multiple branches in parallel and merging the results of each branch into one common solution, in order to minimize time spent searching for a value in a tree-like data structure.

The original paper was written in 1988 by Chris Ferguson and Richard E. Korf, from the University of California's Computer Science Department. They used multiple other chess AIs to develop this wider range algorithm.

== Overview ==
The Distributed Tree Search Algorithm (also known as Korf-Ferguson algorithm) was created to solve the following problem : « Given a tree with non-uniform branching factor and depth, search it in parallel with an arbitrary number of processors as fast as possible. »

The top-level part of this algorithm is general and does not use a particular existing type of tree-search, but it can be easily specialized to fit any type of non-distributed tree-search.

DTS consists of using multiple processes, each with a node and a set of processors attached, with the goal of searching the sub-tree below the said node. Each process then divides itself into multiple coordinated sub-processes which recursively divide themselves again until an optimal way to search the tree has been found based on the number of processors available to each process. Once a process finishes, DTS dynamically reassigns the processors to other processes as to keep the efficiency to a maximum through good load-balancing, especially in irregular trees.

Once a process finishes searching, it recursively sends and merges a resulting signal to its parent-process, until all the different sub-answers have been merged and the entire problem has been solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaaipress.org/Papers/AAAI/1988/AAAI88-023.pdf|title=Distributed Tree Search and it's Application to Alpha-Beta Pruning|last=KORF Richard E., FERGUSON Chris|first=|date=1988|website=AAAI|publisher=University of California, Los Angeles|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
DTS is only applicable under two major conditions: the data structure to search through is a tree, and the algorithm can make use of at least one computation unit (Although it cannot be considered as distributed if there is only one).

One major example of the everyday use of DTS is network routing. The Internet can be seen as a tree of IP addresses, and an analogy to a routing protocol could be how post offices work in the real world. Since there are over 4.3 billion IP addresses currently, society heavily depends on the time the data takes to find its way to its destination. As such, IP-routing divides the work into multiple sub-units which each have different scales of calculation capabilities and use each other's result to find the route in a very efficient manner. This is an instance of DTS that affects over 43% of the world's population, for reasons going from entertainment to national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metaswitch.com/resources/what-is-ip-routing|title=What is IP Routing ?|last=|first=|date=2016|website=MetaSwitch|publisher=MetaSwitch Networks|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives ==
Although DTS is currently one of the most widely used algorithms, many of its applications have alternatives to them which could potentially develop into more efficient, less resource-demanding solutions, were they more researched.

One of the more controversial examples is Big-Data processing. In applications like Google Search Engine, Facebook, YouTube, search needs to be optimized to keep waiting time inside a reasonable window. This could be achieved through the plain use of DTS, but other algorithms are used in place (for example data-hashing in SQL databases), or in conjunction (Facebook's Haystack algorithm groups parallel tree-search, data-hashing and memory-ordering/sorting).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/685565858139515/needle-in-a-haystack-efficient-storage-of-billions-of-photos/|title=Needle in a Haystack : Efficient Storage of Billions of Photos|last=Vajgel|first=Peter|date=April 30, 2009|website=Facebook|publisher=Facebook (company)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more important limits of DTS is the fact that it requires a tree as input. Trees are a sub-instance of a data structure known as Graphs, which means every Graph can be converted into a tree. Although there currently exists no better way to search through trees than Korf-Ferguson's algorithm, each task has different particularities and in most cases, there will exist more efficient data structures to represent the problem and solve it than through tree-search. And so there exist instances of tree structures with cycles that cannot possibly be faster than a graph-search on the same structure with the same processing power.

== Controversy ==
There are few controversies around Korf-Ferguson's DTS algorithm, since it is recognized as very complete, but simple. It is very often used as a stepping stone for students to discover the fundamentals and key concepts of distributed problem-solving.

The most important challenge to this algorithmic concept was an article by Kröll B, « Balanced Distributed Sarch Trees Do Not Exist », which does not attack the veracity or current efficiency of the algorithm, but rather the fact that DTS itself, no matter how many improvements are made to it (for example balancing the input tree before-hand), will never be able to reach optimal resolution-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-60220-8_50|title=Balanced distributed search trees do not exist|last=Kröll|first=Brigitte|last2=Widmayer|first2=Peter|date=1995-08-16|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540602200|editor-last=Akl|editor-first=Selim G.|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=50–61|language=en|editor-last2=Dehne|editor-first2=Frank|editor-last3=Sack|editor-first3=Jörg-Rüdiger|editor-last4=Santoro|editor-first4=Nicola}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opens a new view point : are too many resources used into the completion of DTS, which blocks new algorithms with higher efficiency-potential from getting researched and developed ? Another limit of DTS is the fact that no matter how efficient the division, coordination and merging of the solutions is, it will always be limited by the material number or processors and their processing power. Until recently, this was admitted as being a limit to nearly every computation, but new-generation algorithms like Euclideon might one day be able to crush DFS's efficiency through processing-power-independent problem resolution.

'''Economic statistics''' is a topic in [[applied statistics]] that concerns the [[data collection|collection]], processing, compilation, dissemination, and [[data analysis|analysis]] of [[economic data]]. It is also common to call the data themselves 'economic statistics', but for this usage see [[economic data]]. The data of concern to economic  statistics may include those of an [[economy]] of region, country, or  group of countries. Economic statistics may also refer to a subtopic of [[official statistics]] for data produced by official organizations (e.g. [[List of national and international statistical services|national statistical services]], intergovernmental organizations such as [[United Nations]], [[European Union]] or [[OECD]], [[central bank]]s, ministries, etc.).  Analyses within economic statistics both make use of and provide the empirical data needed in economic research, whether descriptive or [[econometric]]. They are a key input for decision making as to [[economic policy]].
The subject includes statistical analysis of topics and problems in [[microeconomics]], [[macroeconomics]], [[business]], [[finance]],&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Business and Economic Statistics'', [http://pubs.amstat.org/page/jbes/aims-and-scope Aims and Scope.]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[economic forecasting|forecasting]], [[data quality]], and [[Policy analysis|policy]] evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amstat.org/publications/jbes.cfm "Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics, American Statistical Association."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;• Charles J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7753">{{About| |the complexity class |ELEMENTARY| the logical system | Elementary function arithmetic}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''elementary function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of one [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] which is the [[function composition|composition]] of a finite number of [[arithmetic|arithmetic operations]] {{nowrap|(+ – × ÷)}}, [[exponential function|exponential]]s, [[logarithm]]s, [[coefficient|constant]]s, and [[Algebraic equation|solutions of algebraic equations]] (a generalization of [[nth root|''n''th roots]]).

The elementary functions include:
* Powers of &lt;math&gt;x: x, x^2, x^3&lt;/math&gt;, etc.
* Roots of &lt;math&gt;x: \sqrt{x}, \sqrt[3]{x},&lt;/math&gt;, etc.
* [[Exponential function]]s: &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Logarithm]]s: &lt;math&gt;\log x&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Trigonometric function]]s: &lt;math&gt;\sin x, \cos x&lt;/math&gt; etc.
* [[Inverse trigonometric function]]s
* [[Hyperbolic function]]s: &lt;math&gt;\sinh x, \cosh x&lt;/math&gt; etc.
* All functions obtained by replacing ''x'' with any of the previous functions
* All functions obtained by adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing any of the previous functions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ordinary Differential Equations|date=1985|publisher=Dover|isbn=0-486-64940-7|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It follows directly from the definition that the set of elementary functions is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under arithmetic operations and composition. It is also closed under [[derivative|differentiation]]. It is not closed under [[series (mathematics)|limits and infinite sums]]. 

Importantly, the elementary functions are ''not'' closed under [[antiderivative|integration]], as shown by [[Liouville's theorem (differential algebra)|Liouville's theorem]], see [[Nonelementary integral]]. The [[Liouvillian function]]s are defined as the elementary functions and, recursively, the integrals of the Liouvillian functions.

Some elementary functions, such as roots, logarithms, or [[inverse trigonometric function]]s, are not [[entire function]]s and may be [[multivalued function|multivalued]].

Elementary functions were introduced by [[Joseph Liouville]] in a series of papers from 1833 to 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liouville|1833a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liouville|1833b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liouville|1833c}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  An algebraic treatment of elementary functions was started by [[Joseph Fels Ritt]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritt|1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of elementary functions include:
* Addition, e.g. (''x''+1)
* Multiplication, e.g. (2''x'')
* [[Polynomial]] functions
* &lt;math&gt;\dfrac{e^{\tan x}}{1+x^2}\sin\left(\sqrt{1+(\ln x)^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;-i\ln(x+i\sqrt{1-x^2}) &lt;/math&gt;

The last function is equal to &lt;math&gt;\arccos x&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Inverse_trigonometric_functions#Logarithmic_forms|inverse cosine]], in the entire [[complex plane]]. Hence, it is an elementary function. 

=== Non-elementary functions ===
An example of a function that is ''not'' elementary is the [[error function]]

* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{erf}(x)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_0^x e^{-t^2}\,dt,&lt;/math&gt;

a fact that may not be immediately obvious, but can be proven using the [[Risch algorithm]].

* See also the examples in [[Liouvillian_function#Examples|Liouvillian function]] and [[Nonelementary integral]].

==Differential algebra==

The mathematical definition of an '''elementary function''', or a function in elementary form, is considered in the context of [[differential algebra]].  A differential algebra is an algebra with the extra operation of derivation (algebraic version of differentiation).  Using the derivation operation new equations can be written and their solutions used in [[field extension|extensions]] of the algebra.  By starting with the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[rational function]]s, two special types of transcendental extensions (the logarithm and the exponential) can be added to the field building a tower containing elementary functions.

A '''differential field''' ''F'' is a field ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (rational functions over the [[rational number|rationals]] '''Q''' for example) together with a derivation map ''u''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∂''u''.  (Here ∂''u'' is a new function. Sometimes the notation ''u''&amp;prime; is used.) The derivation captures the properties of differentiation, so that for any two elements of the base field, the derivation is linear

: &lt;math&gt;\partial (u + v) = \partial u + \partial v &lt;/math&gt;

and satisfies the [[product rule|Leibniz product rule]]

: &lt;math&gt;\partial(u\cdot v)=\partial u\cdot v+u\cdot\partial v\,.&lt;/math&gt;

An element ''h''  is a constant if ''∂h&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0''.   If the base field is over the rationals, care must be taken when extending the field to add the needed transcendental constants.

A function ''u'' of a differential extension ''F''[''u''] of a differential field ''F'' is an '''elementary function''' over ''F'' if the function ''u''
* is [[Algebraic function|algebraic]] over ''F'', or
* is an '''exponential''', that is, ∂''u'' = ''u'' ∂''a''  for ''a'' ∈ ''F'', or
* is a '''logarithm''', that is, ∂''u'' = ∂''a''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;a for ''a'' ∈ ''F''.
(this is [[Liouville's theorem (differential algebra)|Liouville's theorem]]).

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4297">In [[mathematics]], an '''existence theorem''' is a theorem with a statement beginning '[[there exists|there exist(s)]] ..', or more generally 'for all {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, ... there exist(s) ...'. That is, in more formal terms of [[First-order logic|symbolic logic]], it is a theorem with a [[prenex normal form]] involving the [[existential quantifier]]. Many such theorems will not do so explicitly, as usually stated in standard mathematical language – for example, the statement that the [[sine]] function is [[continuous function|continuous]]; or any theorem written in [[big O notation]].&lt;!-- can be what? The second clause is missing here. --&gt; The quantification can be found in the definitions of the concepts used.

A controversy that goes back to the early twentieth century concerns the issue of purely theoretic existence theorems, i.e., theorems depending on non-constructive foundational material such as the [[axiom of infinity]], the [[axiom of choice]], or the [[law of excluded middle]]. Such theorems provide no indication as to how to exhibit, or construct, the object whose existence is claimed. From a [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] viewpoint, by admitting them mathematics loses its concrete applicability.&lt;ref&gt;See the section on [[Constructive proof#Non-constructive proofs|nonconstructive proofs]] of the entry "''[[Constructive proof]]''".&lt;/ref&gt; The opposing viewpoint is that abstract methods are far-reaching, in a way that [[numerical analysis]] cannot be.

=='Pure' existence results==
An existence theorem is purely theoretical if the proof given of it does not also indicate a construction of the kind of object whose existence is asserted. Such a proof is non-constructive, and the point is that the whole approach may not lend itself to construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis E. Hesseling|title=Gnomes in the Fog: The Reception of Brouwer’s Intuitionism in the 1920s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CXyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA376|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-0348-7989-7|page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[algorithm]]s, purely theoretical existence theorems bypass all algorithms for finding what is asserted to exist. They contrast with "constructive" existence theorems.&lt;ref name="RubinsteinRubinstein1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Isaak Rubinstein|author2=Lev Rubinstein|title=Partial Differential Equations in Classical Mathematical Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLjLf0_yvqsC&amp;pg=PA246|date=28 April 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55846-4|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many constructivist mathematicians work in extended logics (such as [[intuitionistic logic]]) where such existence statements are intrinsically weaker than their constructive counterparts.

Such purely theoretical existence results are in any case ubiquitous in contemporary mathematics. For example, [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]]'s original proof of the existence of a [[Nash equilibrium]], from 1951, was such an existence theorem. In 1962 a constructive approach was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schaefer, Uwe|title=From Sperner's Lemma to Differential Equations in Banach Spaces : An Introduction to Fixed Point Theorems and their Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1B2yBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=3 December 2014|publisher=KIT Scientific Publishing|isbn=978-3-7315-0260-9|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructivist ideas==
From the other direction there has been considerable clarification of what [[constructive mathematics]] is; without the emergence of a 'master theory'. For example, according to [[Errett Bishop]]'s definitions, the continuity of a function such as [[Sine function|{{math|sin&amp;nbsp;''x''}}]] should be proved as a constructive bound on the [[modulus of continuity]], meaning that the existential content of the assertion of continuity is a promise that can always be kept. One could get another explanation from [[type theory]], in which a proof of an existential statement can come only from a ''term'' (which we can see as the computational content).

The '''Fields Medal Symposium''' is an annual event that honours one of the [[Fields Medal]] recipients from the most recent [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]. The symposium is jointly endorsed by the [[International Mathematical Union]] and the [[Fields Institute|Fields Institute for Mathematical Sciences]]. The idea was conceived in preparation for the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] 2010 (ICM2010) in Hyberdad, India. [[Edward Bierstone|Professor Edward Bierstone]] of the [[University of Toronto]] was the director of the institute during the inaugural symposium in October 2012. All symposiums take place at the [[Fields Institute]] in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. The symposia include mathematical activity that explore work related to the honoured Fields Medallist. They will include public lectures meant to spark interest in mathematics including public lectures and events for students.

'''François Peyrard''' (1760–1822) was a French mathematician, educator and  librarian. During the [[French Revolution]], he was involved in the committee that reformed the French educational system. He was one of the founder of the [[École Polytechnique]]  and its first librarian.
 
== Biography and work ==
Born in [[Velay]] (now [[Haute-Loire]]), he was a student at  the ''Collège'' of Le [[Puy-en-Velay]]. Refusing to become priest, he first enrolled  in the [[Gardes françaises]], then arrived in [[Paris]] in 1784 to start a career as mathematics teacher.

In 1793, he joined the committee in charge of reforming the educational system, where he met [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], [[Gaspard Monge|Monge]], [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]. He helped to found the [[École Polytechnique]], for which he was the first librarian.

As mathematician, his main contributions are translations of Euclidean geometry due to his great skills in Greek, Latin, and mathematics. His translations of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' are still considered as the best existing in French.

Due to many personal conflicts, he left the [[École Polytechnique|Polytechnique]], in 1804, just after the release of his first ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' translation. In less than 10 years, he had purchased as librarian approximately ten thousand books.

He then became a teacher at the [[Lycée Condorcet]] (Lycée Bonaparte at that time) in Paris. In 1815 he published a revised edition of [[Étienne Bézout|Bézout]]'s arithmetical opus ''Cours de mathématiques, à l'usage de la marine et de l'artillerie''.

He was the first to identify in 1808&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EUCLID'S GEOMETRY: History and Practice|url=http://mathforum.org/geometry/wwweuclid/vatms.htm|website=mathforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a previously unknown manuscript of Euclid called ''Vaticanus  graecus 190'', a missing part of Euclid’s works, that he dug out of [[Napoléon]]’s booty from the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. He released in 1814 a revised edition of the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', reviewed by [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]], [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]].

He died destitute in 1822.

'''Gödel's incompleteness theorems''' are two [[theorem]]s of [[mathematical logic]] that demonstrate the inherent limitations of every formal [[axiomatic system]] capable of modelling basic [[arithmetic]].  These results, published by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1931, are important both in mathematical logic and in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. The theorems are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that [[Hilbert's program]] to find a complete and consistent set of [[axiom]]s for all [[mathematics]] is impossible.

The first incompleteness theorem states that no [[consistency|consistent system]] of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an [[effective procedure]] (i.e., an [[algorithm]]) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of the [[natural number]]s.  For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.

Employing a [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]], Gödel's incompleteness theorems were the first of several closely related theorems on the limitations of formal systems. They were followed by [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]] on the formal undefinability of truth, [[Alonzo Church|Church]]'s proof that Hilbert's [[Entscheidungsproblem]] is unsolvable, and [[Alan Turing|Turing]]'s theorem that there is no algorithm to solve the [[halting problem]].

== Formal systems: completeness, consistency, and effective axiomatization ==

The incompleteness theorems apply to [[formal system]]s that are of sufficient complexity to express the basic arithmetic of the natural numbers and which are consistent, and  effectively axiomatized, these concepts being detailed below. Particularly in the context of [[first-order logic]], formal systems are also called ''formal theories''. In general, a formal system is a deductive apparatus that consists of a particular set of axioms along with rules of symbolic manipulation (or rules of inference) that allow for the derivation of new theorems from the axioms.  One example of such a system is first-order [[Peano arithmetic]], a system in which all variables are intended to denote natural numbers. In other systems, such as [[set theory]], only some sentences of the formal system express statements about the natural numbers. The incompleteness theorems are about formal provability within these systems, rather than about "provability" in an informal sense.

There are several properties that a formal system may have, including completeness, consistency, and the existence of an effective axiomatization. The incompleteness theorems show that systems which contain a sufficient amount of arithmetic cannot possess all three of these properties.

=== Effective axiomatization ===

A formal system is said to be ''effectively axiomatized'' (also called ''effectively generated'') if its set of theorems is a [[recursively enumerable set]] (Franzén 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;112).

This means that there is a computer program that, in principle, could enumerate all the theorems of the system without listing any statements that are not theorems. Examples of effectively generated theories include Peano arithmetic and [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC).

The theory known as [[true arithmetic]] consists of all true statements about the standard integers in the language of Peano arithmetic. This theory is consistent, and complete, and contains a sufficient amount of arithmetic. However it does not have a recursively enumerable set of axioms, and thus does not satisfy the hypotheses of the incompleteness theorems.

=== Completeness ===

A set of axioms is (''syntactically'', or ''negation''-) [[complete theory|complete]] if, for any statement in the axioms' language, that statement or its negation is provable from the axioms (Smith 2007, p.&amp;nbsp; 24). This is the notion relevant for Gödel's first Incompleteness theorem. It  is not to be confused with ''semantic'' completeness, which means that the set of axioms proves all the semantic tautologies of the given language. In his [[Gödel's completeness theorem|completeness theorem]], Gödel proved that first order logic is ''semantically'' complete. But it is not syntactically complete, since there are sentences expressible in the language of first order logic that can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms of logic alone.

In a mere system of logic it would be absurd to expect syntactic completeness. But in a system of mathematics, thinkers such as Hilbert had believed that it is just a matter of time to find such an axiomatization that would allow one to either prove or disprove (by proving its negation) each and every mathematical formula.

A formal system might be syntactically incomplete by design, such as logics generally are. Or it may be incomplete simply because not all the necessary axioms have been discovered or included. For example, [[Euclidean geometry]] without the [[parallel postulate]] is incomplete, because some statements in the language (such as the parallel postulate itself) can not be proved from the remaining axioms. Similarly, the theory of [[dense linear order]]s is not complete, but becomes complete with an extra axiom stating that there are no endpoints in the order. The [[continuum hypothesis]] is a statement in the language of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] that is not provable within ZFC, so ZFC is not complete. In this case, there is no obvious candidate for a new axiom that resolves the issue.

The theory of first-order [[Peano arithmetic]] is consistent, has an infinite but recursively enumerable set of axioms, and can encode enough arithmetic for the hypotheses of the incompleteness theorem. Thus, by the first incompleteness theorem, Peano Arithmetic is not complete. The theorem gives an explicit example of a statement of arithmetic that is neither provable nor disprovable in Peano's arithmetics. Moreover, this statement is true in the usual [[Model theory|model]]. Moreover, no effectively axiomatized, consistent extension of Peano arithmetic can be complete.

=== Consistency ===
A set of axioms is (simply) [[Consistency|consistent]] if there is no statement such that both the statement and its negation are provable from the axioms, and ''inconsistent'' otherwise.

Peano arithmetic is provably consistent from ZFC, but not from within itself. Similarly, ZFC is not provably consistent from within itself, but ZFC + "there exists an [[inaccessible cardinal]]" proves ZFC is consistent because if {{math|''κ''}} is the least such cardinal, then {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;''κ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} sitting inside the [[von Neumann universe]] is a [[Inner model|model]] of ZFC, and a theory is consistent if and only if it has a model.

If one takes all statements in the language of [[Peano arithmetic]] as axioms, then this theory is complete, has a recursively enumerable set of axioms, and can describe addition and multiplication. However, it is not consistent.

Additional examples of inconsistent theories arise from the [[Naïve set theory#Paradoxes in early set theory|paradoxes]] that result when the [[Axiom schema of specification#Unrestricted comprehension|axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension]] is assumed in set theory.

=== Systems which contain arithmetic ===

The incompleteness theorems apply only to formal systems which are able to prove a sufficient collection of facts about the natural numbers. One sufficient collection is the set of theorems of [[Robinson arithmetic]] ''Q''.  Some systems, such as Peano arithmetic, can directly express statements about natural numbers. Others, such as ZFC set theory, are able to interpret statements about natural numbers into their language. Either of these options is appropriate for the incompleteness theorems.

The theory of [[algebraically closed field]]s of a given characteristic is complete, consistent, and has an infinite but recursively enumerable set of axioms. However it is not possible to encode the integers into this theory, and the theory cannot describe arithmetic of integers.  A similar example is the theory of [[real closed field]]s, which is essentially equivalent to [[Tarski's axioms]] for [[Euclidean geometry]]. So Euclidean geometry itself (in Tarski's formulation) is an example of a complete, consistent, effectively axiomatized theory.

The system of [[Presburger arithmetic]] consists of a set of axioms for the natural numbers with just the addition operation (multiplication is omitted). Presburger arithmetic is complete, consistent, and recursively enumerable and can encode addition but not multiplication of natural numbers, showing that for Gödel's theorems one needs the theory to encode not just addition but also multiplication.

[[Dan Willard]] (2001) has studied some weak families of arithmetic systems which allow enough arithmetic as relations to formalise Gödel numbering, but which are not strong enough to have multiplication as a function, and so fail to prove the second incompleteness theorem; these systems are consistent and capable of proving their own consistency (see [[self-verifying theories]]).

=== Conflicting goals ===
In choosing a set of axioms, one goal is to be able to prove as many correct results as possible, without proving any incorrect results. For example, we could imagine a set of true axioms which allow us to prove every true arithmetical claim about the natural numbers (Smith 2007, p&amp;nbsp;2). In the standard system of first-order logic, an inconsistent set of axioms will prove every statement in its language (this is sometimes called the [[principle of explosion]]), and is thus automatically complete. A set of axioms that is both complete and consistent, however, proves a [[maximal set]] of non-[[Contradiction|contradictory]] theorems (Hinman 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;143).

The pattern illustrated in the previous sections with Peano arithmetic, ZFC, and ZFC + "there exists an inaccessible cardinal" cannot generally be broken. Here ZFC + "there exists an inaccessible cardinal" cannot from itself, be proved consistent. It is also not complete, as illustrated by the in ZFC + "there exists an inaccessible cardinal" theory unresolved continuum hypothesis.

The first incompleteness theorem shows that, in formal systems that can express basic arithmetic, a complete and consistent finite list of axioms can never be created: each time an additional, consistent statement is added as an axiom, there are other true statements that still cannot be proved, even with the new axiom. If an axiom is ever added that makes the system complete, it does so at the cost of making the system inconsistent. It is not even possible for an infinite list of axioms to be complete, consistent, and effectively axiomatized.

== First incompleteness theorem ==

'''Gödel's first incompleteness theorem''' first appeared as "Theorem VI" in Gödel's 1931 paper "[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems]] I".  The hypotheses of the theorem were improved shortly thereafter by J. Barkley Rosser (1936) using [[Rosser's trick]]. The resulting theorem (incorporating Rosser's improvement) may be paraphrased in English as follows, where "formal system" includes the assumption that the system is effectively generated.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''First Incompleteness Theorem''': "Any consistent formal system ''F'' within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there are statements of the language of ''F'' which can neither be proved nor disproved in ''F''." (Raatikainen&amp;nbsp;2015)&lt;!-- this is a direct quote from the SEP article --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The unprovable statement ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; referred to by the theorem is often referred to as "the Gödel sentence"  for the system ''F''. The proof constructs a particular Gödel sentence for the system ''F'', but there are infinitely many statements in the language of the system that share the same properties, such as the conjunction of the Gödel sentence and any [[logically valid]] sentence.

Each effectively generated system has its own Gödel sentence. It is possible to define a larger system ''F’''&amp;nbsp;that contains the whole of ''F'' plus ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; as an additional axiom. This will not result in a complete system, because Gödel's theorem will also apply to ''F’'', and thus ''F’'' also cannot be complete.  In this case, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; is indeed a theorem in ''F’'', because it is an axiom. Because ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; states only that it is not provable in ''F'', no contradiction is presented by its provability within ''F’''.  However, because the incompleteness theorem applies to ''F’'', there will be a new Gödel statement ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F&amp;prime;''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''F’'', showing that ''F’'' is also incomplete.  ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F&amp;prime;''&lt;/sub&gt; will differ from ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; in that  ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F&amp;prime;''&lt;/sub&gt; will refer to ''F’'', rather than&amp;nbsp;''F''.

=== Syntactic form of the Gödel sentence ===

The Gödel sentence is designed to refer, indirectly, to itself. The sentence states that, when a particular sequence of steps is used to construct another sentence, that constructed sentence will not be provable in ''F''. However, the sequence of steps is such that the constructed sentence turns out to be ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; itself. In this way, the Gödel sentence ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; indirectly states its own unprovability within ''F'' (Smith 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;135).

To prove the first incompleteness theorem, Gödel demonstrated that the notion of provability within a system could be expressed purely in terms of arithmetical functions that operate on [[Gödel number]]s of sentences of the system. Therefore, the system, which can prove certain facts about numbers, can also indirectly prove facts about its own statements, provided that it is effectively generated. Questions about the provability of statements within the system are represented as questions about the arithmetical properties of numbers themselves, which would be decidable by the system if it were complete.

Thus, although the Gödel sentence refers indirectly to sentences of the system ''F'', when read as an arithmetical statement the Gödel sentence directly refers only to natural numbers. It asserts that no natural number has a particular property, where that property is given by a [[primitive recursive function|primitive recursive]] relation (Smith 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;141).   As such, the Gödel sentence can be written in the language of arithmetic with a simple syntactic form. In particular, it can be expressed as a formula in the language of arithmetic consisting of a number of leading universal quantifiers followed by a quantifier-free body (these formulas are at level &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]]).  Via the [[MRDP theorem]], the Gödel sentence can be re-written as a statement that a particular polynomial in many variables with integer coefficients never takes the value zero when integers are substituted for its variables (Franz&amp;eacute;n 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;71).

=== Truth of the Gödel sentence ===

The first incompleteness theorem shows that the Gödel sentence  ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; of an appropriate formal theory ''F'' is unprovable in ''F''. Because, when interpreted as a statement about arithmetic, this unprovability is exactly what the sentence (indirectly) asserts, the Gödel sentence is, in fact, true (Smoryński 1977 p.&amp;nbsp;825; also see Franzén 2005 pp.&amp;nbsp;28–33). For this reason, the sentence ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; is often said to be "true but unprovable." (Raatikainen 2015).  However, since the Gödel sentence cannot itself formally specify its intended interpretation, the truth of the sentence ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; may only be arrived at via a meta-analysis from outside the system. In general, this meta-analysis can be carried out within the weak formal system known as [[primitive recursive arithmetic]], which proves the implication Con(''F'')→''G''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;, where Con(''F'') is a canonical sentence asserting the consistency of ''F'' (Smoryński 1977 p.&amp;nbsp;840, Kikuchi and Tanaka 1994 p.&amp;nbsp;403).

Although the Gödel sentence of a consistent theory is true as a statement about the [[intended interpretation]] of arithmetic, the Gödel sentence will be false in some [[Peano axioms#Nonstandard models|nonstandard models of arithmetic]], as a consequence of Gödel's [[completeness theorem]] (Franz&amp;eacute;n 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;135).  That theorem shows that, when a sentence is independent of a theory, the theory will have models in which the sentence is true and models in which the sentence is false.  As described earlier, the Gödel sentence of a system ''F'' is an arithmetical statement which claims that no number exists with a particular property. The incompleteness theorem shows that this claim will be independent of the system ''F'', and the truth of the Gödel sentence follows from the fact that no standard natural number has the property in question. Any model in which the Gödel sentence is false must contain some element which satisfies the property within that model. Such a model must be "nonstandard" &amp;ndash; it must contain elements that do not correspond to any standard natural number (Raatikainen 2015, Franz&amp;eacute;n 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;135).

=== Relationship with the liar paradox ===

Gödel specifically cites [[Richard's paradox]] and the [[liar paradox]] as semantical analogues to his syntactical incompleteness result in the introductory section of "[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I]]".  The [[liar paradox]] is the sentence "This sentence is false."  An analysis of the liar sentence shows that it cannot be true (for then, as it asserts, it is false), nor can it be false (for then, it is true). A Gödel sentence ''G'' for a system ''F'' makes a similar assertion to the liar sentence, but with truth replaced by provability: ''G'' says "''G'' is not provable in the system ''F''."  The analysis of the truth and provability of ''G'' is a formalized version of the analysis of the truth of the liar sentence.

It is not possible to replace "not provable" with "false" in a Gödel sentence because the predicate "Q is the [[Gödel number]] of a false formula" cannot be represented as a formula of arithmetic. This result, known as [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]], was discovered independently both by Gödel, when he was working on the proof of the incompleteness theorem, and by the theorem's namesake, [[Alfred Tarski]].

=== Extensions of Gödel's original result ===

Compared to the theorems stated in Gödel's 1931 paper, many contemporary statements of the incompleteness theorems are more general in two ways. These generalized statements are phrased to apply to a broader class of systems, and they are phrased to incorporate weaker consistency assumptions.

Gödel demonstrated the incompleteness of the system of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', a particular system of arithmetic, but a parallel demonstration could be given for any effective system of a certain expressiveness. Gödel commented on this fact in the introduction to his paper, but restricted the proof to one system for concreteness.  In modern statements of the theorem, it is common to state the effectiveness and expressiveness conditions as hypotheses for the incompleteness theorem, so that it is not limited to any particular formal system. The terminology used to state these conditions was not yet developed in 1931 when Gödel published his results.

Gödel's original statement and proof of the incompleteness theorem requires the assumption that the system is not just consistent but ''[[omega-consistent|ω-consistent]]''. A system is '''ω-consistent''' if it is not ω-inconsistent, and is ω-inconsistent if there is a predicate ''P'' such that for every specific natural number ''m'' the system proves ~''P''(''m''), and yet the system also proves that there exists a natural number ''n'' such that ''P''(''n''). That is, the system says that a number with property ''P'' exists while denying that it has any specific value. The ω-consistency of a system implies its consistency, but consistency does not imply ω-consistency. [[J. Barkley Rosser]] (1936) strengthened the incompleteness theorem by finding a variation of the proof ([[Rosser's trick]]) that only requires the system to be consistent, rather than ω-consistent. This is mostly of technical interest, because all true formal theories of arithmetic (theories whose axioms are all true statements about natural numbers) are ω-consistent, and thus Gödel's theorem as originally stated applies to them. The stronger version of the incompleteness theorem that only assumes consistency, rather than ω-consistency, is now commonly known as Gödel's incompleteness theorem and as the Gödel–Rosser theorem.

== Second incompleteness theorem ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Mathematics]] --&gt;

For each formal system ''F'' containing basic arithmetic, it is possible to canonically define a formula Cons(''F'') expressing the consistency of ''F''. This formula expresses the property that "there does not exist a natural number coding a formal derivation within the system ''F'' whose conclusion is a syntactic contradiction."   The syntactic contradiction is often taken to be "0=1", in which case Cons(''F'') states "there is no natural number that codes a derivation of '0=1' from the axioms of ''F''."

'''Gödel's second incompleteness theorem''' shows that, under general assumptions, this canonical consistency statement Cons(''F'') will not be provable in ''F''. The theorem first appeared as "Theorem XI" in Gödel's 1931 paper "[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I]]". In the following statement, the term "formalized system" also includes an assumption that ''F'' is effectively axiomatized. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Second Incompleteness Theorem''': "Assume ''F'' is a consistent formalized system which contains elementary arithmetic. Then &lt;math&gt;F \not \vdash \text{Cons}(F)&lt;/math&gt;." (Raatikainen 2015)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This theorem is stronger than the first incompleteness theorem because the statement constructed in the first incompleteness theorem does not directly express the consistency of the system. The proof of the second incompleteness theorem is obtained by formalizing the proof of the first incompleteness theorem within the system ''F'' itself.

=== Expressing consistency ===

There is a technical subtlety in the second incompleteness theorem regarding the method of expressing the consistency of ''F'' as a formula in the language of ''F''. There are many ways to express the consistency of a system, and not all of them lead to the same result.  The formula Cons(''F'') from the second incompleteness theorem is a particular expression of consistency.

Other formalizations of the claim that ''F'' is consistent may be inequivalent in ''F'', and some may even be provable. For example, first-order Peano arithmetic (PA) can prove that "the largest consistent [[subset]] of PA" is consistent. But, because PA is consistent, the largest consistent subset of PA is just PA, so in this sense PA "proves that it is consistent". What PA does not prove is that the largest consistent subset of PA is, in fact, the whole of PA. (The term "largest consistent subset of PA" is meant here to be the largest consistent initial segment of the axioms of PA under some particular effective enumeration).

=== The Hilbert&amp;ndash;Bernays conditions ===

The standard proof of the second incompleteness theorem assumes that the provability predicate Prov&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'') satisfies the [[Hilbert–Bernays provability conditions]]. Letting #(''P'') represent the Gödel number of a formula ''P'', the derivability conditions say:

# If ''F'' proves ''P'', then ''F'' proves Prov&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(#(''P'')).
# ''F'' proves 1.; that is, ''F'' proves that if ''F'' proves ''P'', then ''F'' proves Prov&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(#(''P'')). In other words, ''F'' proves that Prov&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(#(''P'')) implies Prov&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(#(Prov&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(#(P)))).
# ''F'' proves that if ''F'' proves that (''P'' → ''Q'') and ''F'' proves ''P'' then ''F'' proves ''Q''. In other words, ''F'' proves that Prov&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(#(''P'' → ''Q'')) and Prov&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(#(''P'')) imply Prov&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(#(''Q'')).

There are systems, such as Robinson arithmetic, which are strong enough to meet the assumptions of the first incompleteness theorem, but which do not prove the Hilbert&amp;mdash;Bernays conditions. Peano arithmetic, however, is strong enough to verify these conditions, as are all theories stronger than Peano arithmetic.

=== Implications for consistency proofs ===

Gödel's second incompleteness theorem also implies that a system ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; satisfying the technical conditions outlined above cannot prove the consistency of any system ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that proves the consistency of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is because such a system ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can prove that if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; proves the consistency of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is in fact consistent. For the claim that ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is consistent has form "for all numbers ''n'', ''n'' has the decidable property of not being a code for a proof of contradiction in ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;". If ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; were in fact inconsistent, then ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would prove for some ''n'' that ''n'' is the code of a contradiction in ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also proved that ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is consistent (that is, that there is no such n), then it would itself be inconsistent. This reasoning can be formalized in ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to show that if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is consistent, then ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is consistent. Since, by second incompleteness theorem, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; does not prove its consistency, it cannot prove the consistency of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; either.

This corollary of the second incompleteness theorem shows that there is no hope of proving, for example, the consistency of Peano arithmetic using any finitistic means that can be formalized in a system the consistency of which is provable in Peano arithmetic (PA). For example, the system of [[primitive recursive arithmetic]] (PRA), which is widely accepted as an accurate formalization of finitistic mathematics, is provably consistent in PA. Thus PRA cannot prove the consistency of PA. This fact is generally seen to imply that [[Hilbert's program]], which aimed to justify the use of "ideal" (infinitistic) mathematical principles in the proofs of "real" (finitistic) mathematical statements by giving a finitistic proof that the ideal principles are consistent, cannot be carried out (Franzén 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;106).

The corollary also indicates the epistemological relevance of the second incompleteness theorem. It would actually provide no interesting information if a system ''F'' proved its consistency. This is because inconsistent theories prove everything, including their consistency. Thus a consistency proof of ''F'' in ''F'' would give us no clue as to whether ''F'' really is consistent; no doubts about the consistency of ''F'' would be resolved by such a consistency proof. The interest in consistency proofs lies in the possibility of proving the consistency of a system ''F'' in some system ''F’'' that is in some sense less doubtful than ''F'' itself, for example weaker than ''F''. For many naturally occurring theories ''F'' and ''F’'', such as ''F'' = Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and ''F’'' = primitive recursive arithmetic, the consistency of ''F’'' is provable in ''F'', and thus ''F’'' cannot prove the consistency of ''F'' by the above corollary of the second incompleteness theorem.

The second incompleteness theorem does not rule out consistency proofs altogether, only consistency proofs that can be formalized in the system that is proved consistent. For example, [[Gerhard Gentzen]] proved the consistency of Peano arithmetic in a different system that includes an axiom asserting that the [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] called ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[wellfounded]]; see [[Gentzen's consistency proof]]. Gentzen's theorem spurred the development of [[ordinal analysis]] in proof theory.

== Examples of undecidable statements ==
{{See also|List of statements independent of ZFC}}

There are two distinct senses of the word "undecidable" in mathematics and computer science. The first of these is the [[proof theory|proof-theoretic]] sense used in relation to Gödel's theorems, that of a statement being neither provable nor refutable in a specified [[deductive system]].  The second sense, which will not be discussed here, is used in relation to [[computability theory]] and applies not to statements but to [[decision problem]]s, which are countably infinite sets of questions each requiring a yes or no answer. Such a problem is said to be undecidable if there is no [[computable function]] that correctly answers every question in the problem set (see [[undecidable problem]]).

Because of the two meanings of the word undecidable, the term [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] is sometimes used instead of undecidable for the "neither provable nor refutable" sense.

Undecidability of a statement in a particular deductive system does not, in and of itself, address the question of whether the [[truth value]] of the statement is well-defined, or whether it can be determined by other means. Undecidability only implies that the particular deductive system being considered does not prove the truth or falsity of the statement. Whether there exist so-called "absolutely undecidable" statements, whose truth value can never be known or is ill-specified, is a controversial point in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

The combined work of Gödel and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] has given two concrete examples of undecidable statements (in the first sense of the term): The [[continuum hypothesis]] can neither be proved nor refuted in [[ZFC]] (the standard axiomatization of [[set theory]]), and the [[axiom of choice]] can neither be proved nor refuted in ZF (which is all the ZFC axioms ''except'' the axiom of choice).  These results do not require the incompleteness theorem.   Gödel proved in 1940 that neither of these statements could be disproved in ZF or ZFC set theory. In the 1960s, Cohen proved that neither is provable from ZF, and the continuum hypothesis cannot be proved from ZFC.

In 1973, [[Saharon Shelah]] showed that the [[Whitehead problem]] in [[group theory]] is undecidable, in the first sense of the term, in standard set theory.

[[Gregory Chaitin]] produced undecidable statements in [[algorithmic information theory]] and proved another incompleteness theorem in that setting. [[Chaitin's incompleteness theorem]] states that for any system that can represent enough arithmetic, there is an upper bound ''c'' such that no specific number can be proved in that system to have [[Kolmogorov complexity]] greater than ''c''. While Gödel's theorem is related to the [[liar paradox]], Chaitin's result is related to [[Berry's paradox]].

=== Undecidable statements provable in larger systems ===

These are natural mathematical equivalents of the Gödel "true but undecidable" sentence. They can be proved in a larger system which is generally accepted as a valid form of reasoning, but are undecidable in a more limited system such as Peano Arithmetic.

In 1977, [[Jeff Paris (mathematician)|Paris]] and [[Leo Harrington|Harrington]] proved that the [[Paris–Harrington theorem|Paris&amp;ndash;Harrington principle]], a version of the infinite [[Ramsey theorem]], is undecidable in (first-order) [[Peano arithmetic]], but can be proved in the stronger system of [[second-order arithmetic]]. Kirby and Paris later showed that [[Goodstein's theorem]], a statement about sequences of natural numbers somewhat simpler than the Paris&amp;ndash;Harrington principle, is also undecidable in Peano arithmetic.

[[Kruskal's tree theorem]], which has applications in computer science, is also undecidable from Peano arithmetic but provable in set theory. In fact Kruskal's tree theorem (or its finite form) is undecidable in a much stronger system codifying the principles acceptable based on a philosophy of mathematics called [[impredicativity|predicativism]].  The related but more general [[graph minor theorem]] (2003) has consequences for [[computational complexity theory]].

== Relationship with computability ==

{{See also|Halting problem#Relationship with Gödel's incompleteness theorems}}
The incompleteness theorem is closely related to several results about [[undecidable set]]s in [[recursion theory]].

[[Stephen Cole Kleene]] (1943) presented a proof of Gödel's incompleteness theorem using basic results of computability theory. One such result shows that the [[halting problem]] is undecidable: there is no computer program that can correctly determine, given any program ''P'' as input, whether ''P'' eventually halts when run with a particular given input. Kleene showed that the existence of a complete effective system of arithmetic with certain consistency properties would force the halting problem to be decidable, a contradiction. This method of proof has also been presented by Shoenfield (1967, p.&amp;nbsp;132); Charlesworth (1980); and Hopcroft and Ullman (1979).

Franzén (2005, p.&amp;nbsp;73) explains how [[Matiyasevich's theorem|Matiyasevich's solution]] to [[Hilbert's 10th problem]] can be used to obtain a proof to Gödel's first incompleteness theorem. [[Yuri Matiyasevich|Matiyasevich]] proved that there is no algorithm that, given a multivariate polynomial p(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) with integer coefficients, determines whether there is an integer solution to the equation ''p'' = 0. Because polynomials with integer coefficients, and integers themselves, are directly expressible in the language of arithmetic, if a multivariate integer polynomial equation ''p'' = 0 does have a solution in the integers then any sufficiently strong system of arithmetic ''T'' will prove this. Moreover, if the system ''T'' is ω-consistent, then it will never prove that a particular polynomial equation has a solution when in fact there is no solution in the integers. Thus, if ''T'' were complete and ω-consistent, it would be possible to determine algorithmically whether a polynomial equation has a solution by merely enumerating proofs of ''T'' until either "''p'' has a solution" or "''p'' has no solution" is found, in contradiction to Matiyasevich's theorem. Moreover, for each consistent effectively generated system ''T'', it is possible to effectively generate a multivariate polynomial ''p'' over the integers such that the equation ''p'' = 0 has no solutions over the integers, but the lack of solutions cannot be proved in ''T'' (Davis 2006:416, Jones 1980).

Smorynski (1977, p.&amp;nbsp;842) shows how the existence of [[recursively inseparable sets]] can be used to prove the first incompleteness theorem. This proof is often extended to show that systems such as Peano arithmetic are [[essentially undecidable]] (see Kleene 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;274).

[[Chaitin's incompleteness theorem]] gives a different method of producing independent sentences, based on [[Kolmogorov complexity]]. Like the proof presented by Kleene that was mentioned above, Chaitin's theorem only applies to theories with the additional property that all their axioms are true in the standard model of the natural numbers. Gödel's incompleteness theorem is distinguished by its applicability to consistent theories that nonetheless include statements that are false in the standard model; these theories are known as [[ω-consistent theory|ω-inconsistent]].

== Proof sketch for the first theorem ==

{{Main|Proof sketch for Gödel's first incompleteness theorem}}

The [[proof by contradiction]] has three essential parts. To begin, choose a formal system that meets the proposed criteria:

# Statements in the system can be represented by natural numbers (known as Gödel numbers). The significance of this is that properties of statements—such as their truth and falsehood—will be equivalent to determining whether their Gödel numbers have certain properties, and that properties of the statements can therefore be demonstrated by examining their Gödel numbers. This part culminates in the construction of a formula expressing the idea that ''"statement S is provable in the system"'' (which can be applied to any statement "S" in the system).
# In the formal system it is possible to construct a number whose matching statement, when interpreted, is [[self reference|self-referential]] and essentially says that it (i.e. the statement itself) is unprovable. This is done using a technique called "[[diagonal lemma|diagonalization]]" (so-called because of its origins as [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]).
# Within the formal system this statement permits a demonstration that it is neither provable nor disprovable in the system, and therefore the system cannot in fact be ω-consistent. Hence the original assumption that the proposed system met the criteria is false.

=== Arithmetization of syntax ===

The main problem in fleshing out the proof described above is that it seems at first that to construct a statement ''p'' that is equivalent to "''p'' cannot be proved", ''p'' would somehow have to contain a reference to ''p'', which could easily give rise to an infinite regress. Gödel's ingenious technique is to show that statements can be matched with numbers (often called the arithmetization of [[syntax]]) in such a way that ''"proving a statement"'' can be replaced with ''"testing whether a number has a given property"''. This allows a self-referential formula to be constructed in a way that avoids any infinite regress of definitions. The same technique was later used by [[Alan Turing]] in his work on the [[Entscheidungsproblem]].

In simple terms, a method can be devised so that every formula or statement that can be formulated in the system gets a unique number, called its [[Gödel number]], in such a way that it is possible to mechanically convert back and forth between formulas and Gödel numbers.  The numbers involved might be very long indeed (in terms of number of digits), but this is not a barrier; all that matters is that such numbers can be constructed. A simple example is the way in which English is stored as a sequence of numbers in computers using [[ASCII]] or [[Unicode]]:
:* The word '''&lt;tt&gt;HELLO&lt;/tt&gt;''' is represented by 72-69-76-76-79 using decimal [[ASCII]], i.e. the number 7269767679.
:* The logical statement '''&lt;tt&gt;x=y =&gt; y=x&lt;/tt&gt;''' is represented by 120-061-121-032-061-062-032-121-061-120 using octal [[ASCII]], i.e. the number 120061121032061062032121061120.

In principle, proving a statement true or false can be shown to be equivalent to proving that the number matching the statement does or doesn't have a given property. Because the formal system is strong enough to support reasoning about ''numbers in general'', it can support reasoning about ''numbers that represent formulae and statements'' as well. Crucially, because the system can support reasoning about ''properties of numbers'', the results are equivalent to reasoning about ''provability of their equivalent statements''.

=== Construction of a statement about "provability" ===

Having shown that in principle the system can indirectly make statements about provability, by analyzing properties of those numbers representing statements it is now possible to show how to create a statement that actually does this.

A formula ''F''(''x'') that contains exactly one free variable ''x'' is called a ''statement form'' or ''class-sign''. As soon as ''x'' is replaced by a specific number, the statement form turns into a ''[[bona fide]]'' statement, and it is then either provable in the system, or not. For certain formulas one can show that for every natural number n, F(n) is true if and only if it can be proved (the precise requirement in the original proof is weaker, but for the proof sketch this will suffice). In particular, this is true for every specific arithmetic operation between a finite number of natural numbers, such as "2×3=6".

Statement forms themselves are not statements and therefore cannot be proved or disproved. But every statement form ''F''(''x'') can be assigned a Gödel number denoted by '''G'''(''F''). The choice of the free variable used in the form ''F''(''x'') is not relevant to the assignment of the Gödel number '''G'''(''F'').

{{anchor|Bew}}The notion of provability itself can also be encoded by Gödel numbers, in the following way: since a proof is a list of statements which obey certain rules, the Gödel number of a proof can be defined. Now, for every statement ''p'', one may ask whether a number ''x'' is the Gödel number of its proof. The relation between the Gödel number of ''p'' and ''x'', the potential Gödel number of its proof, is an arithmetical relation between two numbers.  Therefore, there is a statement form Bew(''y'') that uses this arithmetical relation to state that a Gödel number of a proof of ''y'' exists:
:Bew(''y'') = ∃ ''x'' ( ''y'' is the Gödel number of a formula and ''x'' is the Gödel number of a proof of the formula encoded by ''y'').
The name '''Bew''' is short for ''beweisbar'', the German word for "provable"; this name was originally used by Gödel to denote the provability formula just described.  Note that "Bew(''y'')" is merely an abbreviation that represents a particular, very long, formula in the original language of ''T''; the string "Bew" itself is not claimed to be part of this language.

An important feature of the formula Bew(''y'') is that if a statement ''p'' is provable in the system then Bew('''G'''(''p'')) is also provable. This is because any proof of ''p'' would have a corresponding Gödel number, the existence of which causes Bew('''G'''(''p'')) to be satisfied.

=== Diagonalization ===

The next step in the proof is to obtain a statement which, indirectly, asserts its own unprovability. Although Gödel constructed this statement directly, the existence of at least one such statement follows from the [[diagonal lemma]], which says that for any sufficiently strong formal system and any statement form ''F'' there is a statement ''p'' such that the system proves
:''p'' ↔ ''F''('''G'''(''p'')).
By letting ''F'' be the negation of Bew(''x''), we obtain the theorem
:''p'' ↔ ''~Bew''('''G'''(''p''))
and the ''p'' defined by this roughly states that its own Gödel number is the Gödel number of an unprovable formula.

The statement ''p'' is not literally equal to ~Bew('''G'''(''p'')); rather, ''p'' states that if a certain calculation is performed, the resulting Gödel number will be that of an unprovable statement. But when this calculation is performed, the resulting Gödel number turns out to be the Gödel number of ''p'' itself. This is similar to the following sentence in English:
:", when preceded by itself in quotes, is unprovable.", when preceded by itself in quotes, is unprovable.
This sentence does not directly refer to itself, but when the stated transformation is made the original sentence is obtained as a result, and thus this sentence indirectly asserts its own unprovability. The proof of the diagonal lemma employs a similar method.

Now, assume that the axiomatic system is [[omega-consistent|ω-consistent]], and let ''p'' be the statement obtained in the previous section.

If ''p'' were provable, then Bew('''G'''(''p'')) would be provable, as argued above. But ''p'' asserts the negation of Bew('''G'''(''p'')). Thus the system would be inconsistent, proving both a statement and its negation.  This contradiction shows that ''p'' cannot be provable.

If the negation of ''p'' were provable, then Bew('''G'''(''p'')) would be provable (because ''p'' was constructed to be equivalent to the negation of Bew('''G'''(''p''))). However, for each specific number ''x'', ''x'' cannot be the Gödel number of the proof of ''p'', because ''p'' is not provable (from the previous paragraph). Thus on one hand the system proves there is a number with a certain property (that it is the Gödel number of the proof of ''p''), but on the other hand, for every specific number ''x'', we can prove that it does not have this property. This is impossible in an ω-consistent system. Thus the negation of ''p'' is not provable.

Thus the statement ''p'' is undecidable in our axiomatic system: it can neither be proved nor disproved within the system.

In fact, to show that ''p'' is not provable only requires the assumption that the system is consistent. The stronger assumption of ω-consistency is required to show that the negation of ''p'' is not provable. Thus, if ''p'' is constructed for a particular system:
*If the system is ω-consistent, it can prove neither ''p'' nor its negation, and so ''p'' is undecidable.
*If the system is consistent, it may have the same situation, or it may prove the negation of ''p''. In the later case, we have a statement ("not ''p''") which is false but provable, and the system is not ω-consistent.

If one tries to "add the missing axioms" to avoid the incompleteness of the system, then one has to add either ''p'' or "not ''p''" as axioms. But then the definition of "being a Gödel number of a proof" of a statement changes. which means that the formula Bew(''x'') is now different. Thus when we apply the diagonal lemma to this new Bew, we obtain a new statement ''p'', different from the previous one, which will be undecidable in the new system if it is ω-consistent.

=== Proof via Berry's paradox ===
[[George Boolos]] (1989) sketches an alternative proof of the first incompleteness theorem that uses [[Berry's paradox]] rather than the [[liar paradox]] to construct a true but unprovable formula. A similar proof method was independently discovered by [[Saul Kripke]] (Boolos 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;383).  Boolos's proof proceeds by constructing, for any [[computably enumerable]] set ''S'' of true sentences of arithmetic, another sentence which is true but not contained in ''S''. This gives the first incompleteness theorem as a corollary. According to Boolos, this proof is interesting because it provides a "different sort of reason" for the incompleteness of effective, consistent theories of arithmetic (Boolos 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;388).

=== Computer verified proofs ===
{{See also|Automated theorem proving}}

The incompleteness theorems are among a relatively small number of nontrivial theorems that have been transformed into formalized theorems that can be completely verified by [[proof assistant]] software. Gödel's original proofs of the incompleteness theorems, like most mathematical proofs, were written in natural language intended for human readers.

Computer-verified proofs of versions of the first incompleteness theorem were announced by [[Natarajan Shankar]] in 1986 using [[Nqthm]] (Shankar 1994), by Russell O'Connor in 2003 using [[Coq]] (O'Connor 2005) and by John Harrison in 2009 using [[HOL Light]] (Harrison 2009). A computer-verified proof of both incompleteness theorems was announced by [[Lawrence Paulson]] in 2013 using [[Isabelle theorem prover|Isabelle]] (Paulson 2014).

== Proof sketch for the second theorem ==

The main difficulty in proving the second incompleteness theorem is to show that various facts about provability used in the proof of the first incompleteness theorem can be formalized within the system using a formal predicate for provability. Once this is done, the second incompleteness theorem follows by formalizing the entire proof of the first incompleteness theorem within the system itself.

Let ''p'' stand for the undecidable sentence constructed above, and assume that the consistency of the system can be proved from within the system itself. The demonstration above shows that if the system is consistent, then ''p'' is not provable. The proof of this implication can be formalized within the system, and therefore the statement "''p'' is not provable", or "not ''P''(''p'')" can be proved in the system.

But this last statement is equivalent to ''p'' itself (and this equivalence can be proved in the system), so ''p'' can be proved in the system. This contradiction shows that the system must be inconsistent.

== Discussion and implications ==

The incompleteness results affect the [[philosophy of mathematics]], particularly versions of [[Symbolic Logic|formalism]], which use a single system of formal logic to define their principles.

=== Consequences for logicism and Hilbert's second problem ===

The incompleteness theorem is sometimes thought to have severe consequences for the program of [[logicism]] proposed by [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], which aimed to define the natural numbers in terms of logic (Hellman 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;451–468). [[Bob Hale (philosopher)|Bob Hale]] and [[Crispin Wright]] argue that it is not a problem for logicism because the incompleteness theorems apply equally to first order logic as they do to arithmetic. They argue that only those who believe that the natural numbers are to be defined in terms of first order logic have this problem.

Many logicians believe that Gödel's incompleteness theorems struck a fatal blow to [[David Hilbert]]'s [[Hilbert's second problem|second problem]], which asked for a finitary consistency proof for mathematics. The second incompleteness theorem, in particular, is often viewed as making the problem impossible. Not all mathematicians agree with this analysis, however, and the status of Hilbert's second problem is not yet decided (see "[[Hilbert's second problem#Modern viewpoints on the status of the problem|Modern viewpoints on the status of the problem]]").

=== Minds and machines ===

{{Main|Mechanism (philosophy)#Gödelian arguments}}
Authors including the philosopher [[John Lucas (philosopher)|J. R. Lucas]] and physicist [[Roger Penrose]] have debated what, if anything, Gödel's incompleteness theorems imply about human intelligence. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a [[Turing machine]], or by the [[Church–Turing thesis]], any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is consistent, then Gödel's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.

[[Hilary Putnam]] (1960) suggested that while Gödel's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. Assuming that it is consistent, either its consistency cannot be proved or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.

[[Avi Wigderson]] (2010) has proposed that the concept of mathematical "knowability" should be based on [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] rather than logical decidability.  He writes that "when ''knowability'' is interpreted by modern standards, namely via computational complexity, the Gödel phenomena are very much with us."

[[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his books [[Gödel, Escher, Bach]] and [[I Am a Strange Loop]], cites Gödel's theorems as an example of what he calls a ''strange loop'', a hierarchical, self-referential structure existing within an axiomatic formal system. He argues that this is the same kind of structure which gives rise to consciousness, the sense of "I", in the human mind. While the self-reference in Gödel's theorem comes from the Gödel sentence asserting its own unprovability within the formal system of Principia Mathematica, the self-reference in the human mind comes from the way in which the brain abstracts and categorises stimuli into "symbols", or groups of neurons which respond to concepts, in what is effectively also a formal system, eventually giving rise to symbols modelling the concept of the very entity doing the perception.
Hofstadter argues that a strange loop in a sufficiently complex formal system can give rise to a "downward" or "upside-down" causality, a situation in which the normal hierarchy of cause-and-effect is flipped upside-down. In the case of Gödel's theorem, this manifests, in short, as the following:

"Merely from knowing the formula's meaning, one can infer its truth or falsity without any effort to derive it in the old-fashioned way, which requires one to trudge methodically "upwards" from the axioms. This is not just peculiar; it is astonishing. Normally, one cannot merely look at what a mathematical conjecture says and simply appeal to the content of that statement on its own to deduce whether the statement is true or false." (''I Am a Strange Loop.'')&lt;ref&gt;https://publicism.info/philosophy/strange/14.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the mind, a far more complex formal system, this "downward causality" manifests, in Hofstadter's view, as the ineffable human instinct that the causality of our minds lies on the high level of desires, concepts, personalities, thoughts and ideas, rather than on the low level of interactions between neurons or even fundamental particles, even though according to physics the latter seems to possess the causal power.

"There is thus a curious upside-downness to our normal human way of perceiving the world: we are built to perceive “big stuff” rather than “small stuff”, even though the domain of the tiny seems to be where the actual motors driving reality reside." (''I Am a Strange Loop.'')&lt;ref&gt;https://publicism.info/philosophy/strange/14.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paraconsistent logic ===

Although Gödel's theorems are usually studied in the context of classical logic, they also have a role in the study of [[paraconsistent logic]] and of inherently contradictory statements (''[[dialetheia]]''). [[Graham Priest]] (1984, 2006) argues that replacing the notion of formal proof in Gödel's theorem with the usual notion of informal proof can be used to show that naive mathematics is inconsistent, and uses this as evidence for [[dialetheism]]. The cause of this inconsistency is the inclusion of a truth predicate for a system within the language of the system (Priest 2006:47). [[Stewart Shapiro]] (2002) gives a more mixed appraisal of the applications of Gödel's theorems to dialetheism.

=== Appeals to the incompleteness theorems in other fields ===

Appeals and analogies are sometimes made to the incompleteness theorems in support of arguments that go beyond mathematics and logic. Several authors have commented negatively on such extensions and interpretations, including [[Torkel Franzén]] (2005); Panu Raatikainen (2005); [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] (1999); and [[Ophelia Benson]] and [[Jeremy Stangroom]] (2006). Bricmont and Stangroom (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;10), for example, quote from [[Rebecca Goldstein]]'s comments on the disparity between Gödel's avowed [[Mathematical Platonism|Platonism]] and the [[anti-realist]] uses to which his ideas are sometimes put. Sokal and Bricmont (1999, p.&amp;nbsp;187) criticize [[Régis Debray]]'s invocation of the theorem in the context of sociology; Debray has defended this use as metaphorical (ibid.).

== History ==

After Gödel published his proof of the [[completeness theorem]] as his doctoral thesis in 1929, he turned to a second problem for his [[habilitation]]. His original goal was to obtain a positive solution to [[Hilbert's second problem]] (Dawson 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;63). At the time, theories of the natural numbers and real numbers similar to [[second-order arithmetic]] were known as "analysis", while theories of the natural numbers alone were known as "arithmetic".

Gödel was not the only person working on the consistency problem. [[Wilhelm Ackermann|Ackermann]] had published a flawed consistency proof for analysis in 1925, in which he attempted to use the method of [[Epsilon calculus|ε-substitution]] originally developed by Hilbert. Later that year, [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] was able to correct the proof for a system of arithmetic without any axioms of induction. By 1928, Ackermann had communicated a modified proof to Bernays; this modified proof led Hilbert to announce his belief in 1929 that the consistency of arithmetic had been demonstrated and that a consistency proof of analysis would likely soon follow. After the publication of the incompleteness theorems showed that Ackermann's modified proof must be erroneous, von Neumann produced a concrete example showing that its main technique was unsound (Zach 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;418, Zach 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;33).

In the course of his research, Gödel discovered that although a sentence which asserts its own falsehood leads to paradox, a sentence that asserts its own non-provability does not. In particular, Gödel was aware of the result now called [[Tarski's indefinability theorem]], although he never published it. Gödel announced his first incompleteness theorem to Carnap, Feigel and Waismann on August 26, 1930; all four would attend a key conference in Königsberg the following week.

=== Announcement ===
The 1930 [[Königsberg]] conference was a joint meeting of three academic societies, with many of the key logicians of the time in attendance. Carnap, Heyting, and von Neumann delivered one-hour addresses on the mathematical philosophies of logicism, intuitionism, and formalism, respectively (Dawson 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;69). The conference also included Hilbert's retirement address, as he was leaving his position at the University of Göttingen. Hilbert used the speech to argue his belief that all mathematical problems can be solved. He ended his address by saying,
:For the mathematician there is no ''[[Ignoramus et ignorabimus|Ignorabimus]]'', and, in my opinion, not at all for natural science either. ... The true reason why [no one] has succeeded in finding an unsolvable problem is, in my opinion, that there is no unsolvable problem. In contrast to the foolish ''Ignoramibus'', our credo avers: We must know. We shall know!
This speech quickly became known as a summary of Hilbert's beliefs on mathematics (its final six words, "''Wir müssen wissen. Wir werden wissen!''", were used as Hilbert's epitaph in 1943). Although Gödel was likely in attendance for Hilbert's address, the two never met face to face (Dawson 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;72).

Gödel announced his first incompleteness theorem at a roundtable discussion session on the third day of the conference. The announcement drew little attention apart from that of von Neumann, who pulled Gödel aside for conversation. Later that year, working independently with knowledge of the first incompleteness theorem, von Neumann obtained a proof of the second incompleteness theorem, which he announced to Gödel in a letter dated November 20, 1930 (Dawson 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;70). Gödel had independently obtained the second incompleteness theorem and included it in his submitted manuscript, which was received by ''Monatshefte für Mathematik'' on November 17, 1930.

Gödel's paper was published in the ''Monatshefte'' in 1931 under the title "''Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I''" ("[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I]]"). As the title implies, Gödel originally planned to publish a second part of the paper in the next volume of the ''Monatshefte''; the prompt acceptance of the first paper was one reason he changed his plans (van Heijenoort 1967:328, footnote 68a).

=== Generalization and acceptance ===

Gödel gave a series of lectures on his theorems at Princeton in 1933–1934 to an audience that included Church, Kleene, and Rosser. By this time, Gödel had grasped that the key property his theorems required is that the system must be effective (at the time, the term "general recursive" was used). Rosser proved in 1936 that the hypothesis of ω-consistency, which was an integral part of Gödel's original proof, could be replaced by simple consistency, if the Gödel sentence was changed in an appropriate way. These developments left the incompleteness theorems in essentially their modern form.

Gentzen published his [[Gentzen's consistency proof|consistency proof]] for first-order arithmetic in 1936. Hilbert accepted this proof as "finitary" although (as Gödel's theorem had already shown) it cannot be formalized within the system of arithmetic that is being proved consistent.

The impact of the incompleteness theorems on Hilbert's program was quickly realized. Bernays included a full proof of the incompleteness theorems in the second volume of ''Grundlagen der Mathematik'' (1939), along with additional results of Ackermann on the ε-substitution method and Gentzen's consistency proof of arithmetic. This was the first full published proof of the second incompleteness theorem.

=== Criticisms ===

==== Finsler ====

[[Paul Finsler]] (1926) used a version of [[Richard's paradox]] to construct an expression that was false but unprovable in a particular, informal framework he had developed. Gödel was unaware of this paper when he proved the incompleteness theorems (Collected Works Vol. IV., p.&amp;nbsp;9). Finsler wrote to Gödel in 1931 to inform him about this paper, which Finsler felt had priority for an incompleteness theorem. Finsler's methods did not rely on formalized provability, and had only a superficial resemblance to Gödel's work (van Heijenoort 1967:328). Gödel read the paper but found it deeply flawed, and his response to Finsler laid out concerns about the lack of formalization (Dawson:89). Finsler continued to argue for his philosophy of mathematics, which eschewed formalization, for the remainder of his career.

==== Zermelo ====
&lt;!-- Zermelo criticized the incompleteness theorems for their reliance on finitary proofs. In 1931, he presented a system of infinitely-long proofs, which he believed could be used to overcome the limitations shown by the incompleteness theorems.--&gt;
In September 1931, [[Ernst Zermelo]] wrote to Gödel to announce what he described as an "essential gap" in Gödel's argument (Dawson:76). In October, Gödel replied with a 10-page letter (Dawson:76, Grattan-Guinness:512-513), where he pointed out that Zermelo mistakenly assumed that the notion of truth in a system is definable in that system (which is not true in general by [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]]). But Zermelo did not relent and published his criticisms in print with "a rather scathing paragraph on his young competitor" (Grattan-Guinness:513). Gödel decided that to pursue the matter further was pointless, and Carnap agreed (Dawson:77). Much of Zermelo's subsequent work was related to logics stronger than first-order logic, with which he hoped to show both the consistency and categoricity of mathematical theories.

==== Wittgenstein ====

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] wrote several passages about the incompleteness theorems that were published posthumously in his 1953 ''[[Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics]]'', in particular one section sometimes called the "notorious paragraph" where he seems to confuse the notions of "true" and "provable" in Russell's system. Gödel was a member of the [[Vienna Circle]] during the period in which Wittgenstein's early [[ideal language philosophy]] and [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] dominated the circle's thinking.  There has been some controversy about whether Wittgenstein misunderstood the incompleteness theorem or just expressed himself unclearly. Writings in Gödel's [[Nachlass]] express the belief that Wittgenstein misread his ideas.

Multiple commentators have read Wittgenstein as misunderstanding [[Gödel]] (Rodych 2003), although [[Juliet Floyd]] and [[Hilary Putnam]] (2000), as well as [[Graham Priest]] (2004) have provided textual readings arguing that most commentary misunderstands Wittgenstein. On their release, Bernays, Dummett, and Kreisel wrote separate reviews on Wittgenstein's remarks, all of which were extremely negative (Berto 2009:208). The unanimity of this criticism caused Wittgenstein's remarks on the incompleteness theorems to have little impact on the logic community. In 1972, Gödel stated: "Has Wittgenstein lost his mind? Does he mean it seriously? He intentionally utters trivially nonsensical statements" (Wang 1996:179), and wrote to [[Karl Menger]]  that Wittgenstein's comments demonstrate a misunderstanding of the incompleteness theorems writing:

:"It is clear from the passages you cite that Wittgenstein did ''not'' understand [the first incompleteness theorem] (or pretended not to understand it). He interpreted it as a kind of logical paradox, while in fact is just the opposite, namely a mathematical theorem within an absolutely uncontroversial part of mathematics (finitary number theory or combinatorics)." (Wang 1996:179)

Since the publication of Wittgenstein's ''Nachlass'' in 2000, a series of papers in philosophy have sought to evaluate whether the original criticism of Wittgenstein's remarks was justified. Floyd and Putnam (2000) argue that Wittgenstein had a more complete understanding of the incompleteness theorem than was previously assumed. They are particularly concerned with the interpretation of a Gödel sentence for an ω-inconsistent system as actually saying "I am not provable", since the system has no models in which the provability predicate corresponds to actual provability. Rodych (2003) argues that their interpretation of Wittgenstein is not historically justified, while Bays (2004) argues against Floyd and Putnam's philosophical analysis of the provability predicate. Berto (2009) explores the relationship between Wittgenstein's writing and theories of paraconsistent logic.

=== Translations, during his lifetime, of Gödel's paper into English ===

None of the following agree in all translated words and in typography. The typography is a serious matter, because Gödel expressly wished to emphasize "those metamathematical notions that had been defined in their usual sense before . . ." (van Heijenoort 1967:595). Three translations exist. Of the first John Dawson states that: "The Meltzer translation was seriously deficient and received a devastating review in the ''Journal of Symbolic Logic''; "Gödel also complained about Braithwaite's commentary (Dawson 1997:216). "Fortunately, the Meltzer translation was soon supplanted by a better one prepared by Elliott Mendelson for Martin Davis's anthology ''The Undecidable'' . . . he found the translation "not quite so good" as he had expected . . . [but because of time constraints he] agreed to its publication" (ibid). (In a footnote Dawson states that "he would regret his compliance, for the published volume was marred throughout by sloppy typography and numerous misprints" (ibid)). Dawson states that "The translation that Gödel favored was that by Jean van Heijenoort" (ibid). For the serious student another version exists as a set of lecture notes recorded by Stephen Kleene and J. B. Rosser "during lectures given by Gödel at to the Institute for Advanced Study during the spring of 1934" (cf commentary by Davis 1965:39 and beginning on p.&amp;nbsp;41); this version is titled "On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems". In their order of publication:

In [[mathematics]], a '''homogeneous polynomial''' is a [[polynomial]] whose nonzero terms all have the same [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Cox, J. Little, D. O'Shea: ''Using Algebraic Geometry'', 2nd ed., page 2. Springer-Verlag, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, &lt;math&gt;x^5 + 2 x^3 y^2 + 9 x y^4&lt;/math&gt; is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5, in two variables; the sum of the exponents in each term is always 5. The polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 3 x^2 y + z^7&lt;/math&gt; is not homogeneous, because the sum of exponents does not match from term to term. A polynomial is homogeneous if and only if it defines a [[homogeneous function]].  An '''algebraic form''', or simply '''form''', is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] defined by a homogeneous polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;However, as some authors do not make a clear distinction between a polynomial and its associated function, the terms ''homogeneous polynomial'' and ''form'' are sometimes considered as synonymous.&lt;/ref&gt; A '''binary form''' is a form in two variables. A ''form'' is also a function defined on a [[vector space]], which may be expressed as a homogeneous function of the coordinates over any [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].

A polynomial of degree 0 is always homogeneous; it is simply an element of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] or [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of the coefficients, usually called a constant or a scalar. A form of degree 1 is a linear form.&lt;ref&gt;''Linear forms'' are defined only for finite-dimensional vector space, and have thus to be distinguished from ''[[linear functional]]s'', which are defined for every vector space. "Linear functional" is rarely used for finite-dimensional vector spaces.&lt;/ref&gt; A form of degree 2 is a [[quadratic form]]. In [[geometry]], the [[Euclidean distance]] is the [[square root]] of a quadratic form.

Homogeneous polynomials are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics.&lt;ref&gt;Homogeneous polynomials in physics often appear as a consequence of [[dimensional analysis]], where measured quantities must match in real-world problems.&lt;/ref&gt; They play a fundamental role in algebraic geometry, as a [[projective algebraic variety]] is defined as the set of  the common zeros of a set of homogeneous polynomials.

==Properties==
A homogeneous polynomial defines a [[homogeneous function]]. This means that, if a [[multivariate polynomial]] ''P'' is homogeneous of degree ''d'', then
:&lt;math&gt;P(\lambda x_1, \ldots, \lambda x_n)=\lambda^d\,P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
for every &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in any [[field (mathematics)|field]] containing the [[coefficient]]s of ''P''. Conversely, if the above relation is true for infinitely many  &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; then the polynomial is homogeneous of degree ''d''.

In particular, if ''P'' is homogeneous then 
:&lt;math&gt;P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad P(\lambda x_1, \ldots, \lambda x_n)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
for every &lt;math&gt;\lambda.&lt;/math&gt; This property is fundamental in the definition of a [[projective variety]].

Any nonzero polynomial may be decomposed, in a unique way, as a sum of homogeneous polynomials of different degrees, which are called the '''homogeneous components''' of the polynomial. 

Given a [[polynomial ring]] &lt;math&gt;R=K[x_1, \ldots,x_n]&lt;/math&gt; over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] (or, more generally, a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]) ''K'', the homogeneous polynomials of degree ''d'' form
a [[vector space]] (or a [[module (mathematics)|module]]), commonly denoted &lt;math&gt;R_d.&lt;/math&gt; The above unique decomposition means that &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[direct sum]] of the &lt;math&gt;R_d&lt;/math&gt; (sum over all [[nonnegative integer]]s).

The dimension of the vector space (or [[free module]]) &lt;math&gt;R_d&lt;/math&gt; is the number of different monomials of degree ''d'' in ''n'' variables (that is the maximal number of nonzero terms in a homogeneous polynomial of degree ''d'' in ''n'' variables). It is equal to the [[binomial coefficient]]

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{d+n-1}{n-1}=\binom{d+n-1}{d}=\frac{(d+n-1)!}{d!(n-1)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|Euler's identity for homogeneous polynomials}}
Homogeneous polynomial satisfy  [[Euler's homogeneous function theorem|Euler's identity for homogeneous functions]]. That is, if {{math|''P''}} is a homogeneous polynomial of degree {{math|''d''}} in the indeterminates &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_n,&lt;/math&gt; one has, whichever is the [[commutative ring]] of the coefficients,
:&lt;math&gt;dP=\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[formal derivative|formal partial derivative]] of {{math|''P''}} with respect to &lt;math&gt;x_i.&lt;/math&gt;

==Homogenization==
A non-homogeneous polynomial ''P''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) can be homogenized by introducing an additional variable ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and defining the homogeneous polynomial sometimes denoted &lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;''P'':&lt;ref&gt;D. Cox, J. Little, D. O'Shea: ''Using Algebraic Geometry'', 2nd ed., page 35. Springer-Verlag, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{^h\!P}(x_0,x_1,\dots, x_n) = x_0^d P \left (\frac{x_1}{x_0},\dots, \frac{x_n}{x_0} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''d'' is the [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] of ''P''. For example, if
:&lt;math&gt;P=x_3^3 + x_1 x_2+7,&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;^h\!P=x_3^3 + x_0 x_1x_2 + 7 x_0^3.&lt;/math&gt;

A homogenized polynomial can be dehomogenized by setting the additional variable ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. That is
:&lt;math&gt;P(x_1,\dots, x_n)={^h\!P}(1,x_1,\dots, x_n).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2826">'''Jacob Klein''' (March 3, 1899 &amp;ndash; July 16, 1978) was a [[Russian-American]] philosopher and interpreter of [[Plato]], who worked extensively on the nature and historical origin of modern symbolic mathematics.

==Biography==
Klein was born in [[Liepāja|Libava]], [[Russian Empire]]. He studied at [[Berlin]] and [[Marburg]], where he received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1922. A student of [[Nicolai Hartmann]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Edmund Husserl]], he later taught at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] from 1937 until his death. He served as dean from 1949 to 1958.

Klein was affectionately known as Jasha. He was one of the world's preeminent interpreters of Plato and the Platonic tradition. As one of many Jewish scholars who were no longer safe in Europe, he fled the Nazis. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windsofchange.net/archives/005261.php|title=What I Learned from Some Eminent Émigré Scholars|last=Burk|first=Robin|year=2004|accessdate=2009-02-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616143035/http://windsofchange.net/archives/005261.php|archivedate=2008-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central thesis of his work [https://books.google.com/books?id=EkPDAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Greek Mathematical Thought and the Origin of Algebra''] is that the modern concept of mathematics is based on the symbolic interpretation of the Greek concept of number (''[[wikt:ἀριθμός|arithmos]]'').

Klein died in 1978 in [[Annapolis, Maryland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8057">The '''Kempner series''' is a modification of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], formed by omitting all terms whose denominator expressed in base 10 contains the digit 9. That is, it is the sum
:&lt;math&gt; {\sideset{}{'}\sum_{n=1}^\infty} \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
where the prime indicates that ''n'' takes only values whose decimal expansion has no nines. The series was first studied by [[Aubrey J. Kempner|A. J. Kempner]] in 1914.&lt;ref name="Kempner 1914"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is [[Counterintuitive|counter-intuitive]] because, unlike the harmonic series, it converges. Kempner showed the sum of this series is less than 80. Baillie&lt;ref name="Baillie 1979" /&gt; showed that, rounded to 20 decimals, the actual sum is 22.92067 66192 64150 34816
{{OEIS|A082838}}.

Heuristically, this series converges because most large integers contain all digits. For example, a random 100-digit integer is very likely to contain at least one '9', causing it to be excluded from the above sum.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; found an efficient [[algorithm]] for the more general problem of any omitted string of digits. For example, the sum of 1/''n'' where ''n'' has no "42" is about 228.44630 41592 30813 25415. Another example: the sum of 1/''n'' where ''n'' has no occurrence of the digit string "314159" is about 2302582.33386 37826 07892 02376. (All values are rounded in the last decimal place).

==Convergence==

Kempner's proof of convergence&lt;ref name="Kempner 1914" /&gt; is repeated in many textbooks, for example Hardy and Wright&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hardy | first = G. H. |author2=E. M. Wright  | title = An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1979 | edition=5th | isbn = 0-19-853171-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|120}} and Apostol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Apostol | first = Tom | title = Mathematical Analysis | publisher = Addison&amp;ndash;Wesley | location = Boston | year = 1974 | isbn = 0-201-00288-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|212}} We group the terms of the sum by the number of digits in the denominator. The number of ''n''-digit positive integers that have no digit equal to '9' is 8(9&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) because there are 8 choices (1 through 8) for the first digit, and 9 independent choices (0 through 8) for each of the other ''n''&amp;minus;1 digits. Each of these numbers having no '9' is greater than or equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, so the reciprocal of each of these numbers is less than or equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;''1''&amp;minus;n&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the contribution of this group to the sum of reciprocals is less than 8(9/10)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore the whole sum of reciprocals is at most

:&lt;math&gt;8 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^{n-1} = 80.&lt;/math&gt;

The same argument works for any omitted non-zero digit. The number of ''n''-digit positive integers that have no '0' is 9&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, so the sum of 1/''n'' where ''n'' has no digit '0' is at most

:&lt;math&gt;9 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^{n-1} = 90.&lt;/math&gt;

The series also converge if strings of ''k'' digits are omitted, for example if we omit all denominators that have a decimal substring of 42. This can be proved in almost the same way.&lt;ref name="Schmelzer and Baillie 2008" /&gt; First we observe that we can work with numbers in base 10&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and omit all denominators that have the given string as a "digit". The analogous argument to the base 10 case shows that this series converges. Now switching back to base 10, we see that this series contains all denominators that omit the given string, as well as denominators that include it if it is not on a "''k''-digit" boundary. For example, if we are omitting 42, the base-100 series would omit 4217 and 1742, but not 1427, so it is larger than the series that omits all 42s.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered generalized Kempner series, namely, the sums ''S''(''d'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') of the reciprocals of the positive integers that have exactly ''n'' instances of the digit&amp;nbsp;''d'' where 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''d''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;9 (so that the original Kempner series is ''S''(9,&amp;nbsp;0)). He showed that for each ''d'' the sequence of values ''S''(''d'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 is decreasing and converges to 10&amp;nbsp;ln&amp;nbsp;10. The sequence is not in general decreasing starting with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; for example, for the original Kempner series we have ''S''(9,&amp;nbsp;0) ≈&amp;nbsp;22.921&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;23.026 ≈&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;ln&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''S''(9,&amp;nbsp;''n'') for&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.

==Approximation methods==

The series converges extremely slowly. Baillie&lt;ref name="Baillie 1979" /&gt; remarks that after summing 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; terms the remainder is still larger than 1.

The upper bound of 80 is very crude, and Irwin showed&lt;ref&gt;

'''Lance Jeremy Fortnow''' (born August 15, 1963) is a [[computer scientist]] known for major results in [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] and [[interactive proof systems]].  He currently chairs the [[Georgia Institute of Technology School of Computer Science|School of Computer Science]] at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]].

==Biography==

Lance Fortnow received a doctorate in Applied Mathematics from MIT in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=65071 Lance Fortnow] at the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; supervised by [[Michael Sipser]]. Since graduation, he's served on the faculty of the [[University of Chicago]] (1989-1999, 2003-2007), [[Northwestern University]] (2008-2012), and most recently the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (2012–present) as chair of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology School of Computer Science|School of Computer Science]].&lt;ref name="FortnowHired"&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/college-computing-hires-fortnow-anton-lead-schools | title=College of Computing Hires Fortnow, Anton to Lead Schools | publisher=[[Georgia Tech College of Computing]] | date=March 19, 2012 | accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/ Northwestern University Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department Faculty]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortnow was the founding editor-in-chief of the journal ACM Transactions on Computation Theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toct.acm.org/ ACM Transactions on Computation Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the chair of ACM SIGACT&lt;ref&gt;[http://sigact.acm.org/ ACM SIGACT]&lt;/ref&gt; and succeeded by Paul Beame.  He was the chair of the IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computationalcomplexity.org/ IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity]&lt;/ref&gt; from 2000 to 2006. In 2003, Fortnow began one of the first blogs devoted to theoretical computer science&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/ Computational Complexity Weblog]&lt;/ref&gt; and has written for it since then; since 2007 he has had a co-blogger, [[William Gasarch]]. In September 2009, Fortnow brought mainstream attention to complexity theory when he published an article surveying the progress made in the P versus NP problem in the Communications of the Association of Computing Machinery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/science/Wpolynom.html?_r=1 J. Markoff. Prizes Aside, the P-NP Puzzler Has Consequences. ''The New York Times'' 7 Oct. 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/9/38904-the-status-of-the-p-versus-np-problem/fulltext L. Fortnow. The Status of the P Versus NP Problem. ''Communications of the ACM'' 9 (2009).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

In his many publications, Fortnow has contributed important results to the field of [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]]. While still a graduate student at MIT, Fortnow showed that there are no perfect zero-knowledge [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocols]] for NP-complete languages unless the [[polynomial hierarchy]] collapses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=28418 L. Fortnow. The complexity of perfect zero-knowledge. In S. Micali, editor, ''Randomness and Computation'', volume 5 of ''Advances in Computing Research'', pages 327-343. JAI Press, Greenwich, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt;  With Michael Sipser, he also demonstrated that relative to a specific oracle there exists a language in co-NP that does not have an interactive protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=49327 L. Fortnow and M. Sipser. Are there interactive protocols for co-NP languages? ''Information Processing Letters'', 28:249-251, 1988.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1989, Fortnow received an email from [[Noam Nisan]] showing that co-NP had multiple prover interactive proofs (MIP).  With [[Carsten Lund]] and Howard Karloff, he used this result to develop an algebraic technique for the construction of interactive proof systems and prove that every language in the polynomial-time hierarchy has an interactive proof system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=146585.146605 C. Lund, L. Fortnow, H. Karloff, and N. Nisan. Algebraic methods for interactive proof systems. ''Journal of the ACM'', 39(4):859-868, 1992.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Their work was hardly two weeks old when [[Adi Shamir]] employed it to prove that IP=PSPACE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=146585.146609#references A. Shamir. IP = PSPACE. ''Journal of the ACM'' 39(4):869-877, 1992.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Quickly following up on this (January 17, 1990 less than two months after receiving Nisan's email) Fortnow, along with [[László Babai]] and Carsten Lund, proved that MIP=NEXP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1398742 L. Babai, L. Fortnow, and C. Lund. Nondeterministic exponential time has two-prover interactive protocols. ''Computational Complexity'', 1(1):3-40, 1991.]&lt;/ref&gt;  These algebraic techniques were expanded further by Fortnow, Babai, [[Leonid Levin]], and [[Mario Szegedy]] when they presented a new generic mechanism for checking computations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=103428 L. Babai, L. Fortnow, L. Levin, and M. Szegedy. Checking computations in polylogarithmic time. In ''Proceedings of the 23rd ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing'', pages 21-31. ACM, New York, 1991.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this time Fortnow has continued to publish on a variety of topics in the field of computational complexity including [[derandomization]], [[sparse language]]s, and [[oracle machine]]s.  Fortnow has also published on [[quantum computing]], [[game theory]], [[genome sequencing]], and [[economics]].

Lance Fortnow's work in economics includes work in game theory, optimal strategies, and prediction. With Duke Whang, Fortnow has examined the classic game theory problem of the [[prisoner's dilemma]], extending the problem so that the dilemma is posed sequentially an infinite number of times.  They investigated what strategies the players should take given the constraints that they draw their strategies from computationally bounded sets and introduce “grace periods” to prevent the dominance of vengeful strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=195448 L. Fortnow and D. Whang. Optimality and domination in repeated games with bounded players. In ''Proceedings of the 26th ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing'', pages 741-749. ACM, New York, 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Fortnow also examined the [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] market scoring rule (LMSR) with [[market makers]].  He helped to show that LMSR pricing is [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-hard]] and propose an approximation technique for pricing permutation markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1386822 Y. Chen, L. Fortnow, N. Lambert, D. Pennock, and J. Wortman. Complexity of [[combinatorial]] market makers. In ''Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce'', pages 190-199. ACM, New York, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also contributed to an examination the behavior of informed traders working with LMSR market makers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~parkes/radcliffe09papers/PM-strategies.pdf Y. Chen, S. Dimitrov, R. Sami, D. Reeves, D. Pennock, R. Hanson, L. Fortnow, and R. Gonen. Gaming prediction markets: Equilibrium strategies with a market maker. ''Algorithmica'', 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortnow has also authored a popular science book, titled ''The Golden Ticket: P, NP and the Search for the Impossible''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9937.html Fortnow, Lance. ''The Golden Ticket: P, NP and the Search for the Impossible''.

Review Article]&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Fortnow provides a non-technical introduction to the P versus NP problem and its algorithmic limitations. He further describes his book and illustrates why NP problems are so important on the ''Data Skeptic podcast''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2017/p-vs-np ''P vs NP.''

{{General geometry |0d/1d}}

The notion of '''line''' or '''straight line''' was introduced by ancient mathematicians to represent straight objects (i.e., having no [[curvature]]) with negligible width and depth. Lines are an idealization of such objects. Until the 17th century, lines were defined in this manner: "The [straight or curved] line is the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width. […] The straight line is that which is equally extended between its points."&lt;ref&gt;In (rather old) French: "La ligne est la première espece de quantité, laquelle a tant seulement une dimension à sçavoir longitude, sans aucune latitude ni profondité, &amp; n'est autre chose que le flux ou coulement du poinct, lequel […] laissera de son mouvement imaginaire quelque vestige en long, exempt de toute latitude. […] La ligne droicte est celle qui est également estenduë entre ses poincts." Pages 7 and 8 of ''Les quinze livres des éléments géométriques d'Euclide Megarien, traduits de Grec en François, &amp; augmentez de plusieurs figures &amp; demonstrations, avec la corrections des erreurs commises és autres traductions'', by Pierre Mardele, Lyon, MDCXLV (1645).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euclid]] described a line as "breadthless length" which "lies equally with respect to the points on itself"; he introduced several [[postulate]]s as basic unprovable properties from which he constructed all of geometry, which is now called [[Euclidean geometry]] to avoid confusion with other geometries which have been introduced since the end of the 19th century (such as [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], [[Projective geometry|projective]] and [[affine geometry]]).

In modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described. For instance, in [[analytic geometry]], a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given [[linear equation]], but in a more abstract setting, such as [[incidence geometry]], a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it.

When a geometry is described by a set of [[axiom]]s, the notion of a line is usually left undefined (a so-called [[primitive notion|primitive]] object). The properties of lines are then determined by the axioms which refer to them. One advantage to this approach is the flexibility it gives to users of the geometry.  Thus in [[differential geometry]] a line may be interpreted as a [[geodesic]] (shortest path between points), while in some [[Projective geometry|projective geometries]] a line is a 2-dimensional vector space (all linear combinations of two independent vectors). This flexibility also extends beyond mathematics and, for example, permits physicists to think of the path of a light ray as being a line.

==Definitions versus descriptions==
All definitions are ultimately [[Circular definition|circular]] in nature since they depend on concepts which must themselves have definitions, a dependence which cannot be continued indefinitely without returning to the starting point. To avoid this vicious circle certain concepts must be taken as [[primitive notion|primitive]] concepts; terms which are given no definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|loc=pg. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In geometry, it is frequently the case that the concept of line is taken as a primitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faber|1983|loc=pg. 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those situations where a line is a defined concept, as in [[coordinate geometry]], some other fundamental ideas are taken as primitives. When the line concept is a primitive, the behaviour and properties of lines are dictated by the [[axiom]]s which they must satisfy.

In a non-axiomatic or simplified axiomatic treatment of geometry, the concept of a primitive notion may be too abstract to be dealt with. In this circumstance it is possible that a ''description'' or ''mental image'' of a primitive notion is provided to give a foundation to build the notion on which would formally be based on the (unstated) axioms. Descriptions of this type may be referred to, by some authors, as definitions in this informal style of presentation. These are not true definitions and could not be used in formal proofs of statements. The "definition" of line in [[Euclid's Elements]] falls into this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faber|1983|loc=pg. 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the case where a specific geometry is being considered (for example, [[Euclidean geometry]]), there is no generally accepted agreement among authors as to what an informal description of a line should be when the subject is not being treated formally.

==In Euclidean geometry==
{{see also|Euclidean geometry}}
When geometry was first formalised by [[Euclid]] in the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', he defined a general line (straight or curved) to be "breadthless length" with a straight line being a line "which lies evenly with the points on itself".&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Appendix A, p.&amp;nbsp;291.&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions serve little purpose since they use terms which are not, themselves, defined. In fact, Euclid did not use these definitions in this work and probably included them just to make it clear to the reader what was being discussed. In modern geometry, a line is simply taken as an undefined object with properties given by [[axiom]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Part III, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; but is sometimes defined as a set of points obeying a linear relationship when some other fundamental concept is left undefined.

In an [[axiom]]atic formulation of Euclidean geometry, such as that of [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert]] (Euclid's original axioms contained various flaws which have been corrected by modern mathematicians),&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Part III, p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt; a line is stated to have certain properties which relate it to other lines and [[point (geometry)|points]]. For example, for any two distinct points, there is a unique line containing them, and any two distinct lines intersect in at most one point.&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Appendix B, p.&amp;nbsp;300.&lt;/ref&gt; In two [[dimension]]s, i.e., the Euclidean [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], two lines which do not intersect are called [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]]. In higher dimensions, two lines that do not intersect are parallel if they are contained in a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], or [[Skew lines|skew]] if they are not.

Any collection of finitely many lines partitions the plane into [[convex polygon]]s (possibly unbounded); this partition is known as an [[arrangement of lines]].

===On the Cartesian plane===

Lines in a [[Cartesian plane]] or, more generally, in [[affine coordinates]], can be described algebraically by [[linear equation]]s. 

In [[Two-dimensional space|two dimensions]], the equation for non-vertical lines is often given in the ''[[slope-intercept form]]'':
:&lt;math&gt; y = mx + b &lt;/math&gt;
where:
: ''m'' is the [[slope]] or [[slope|gradient]] of the line.
: ''b'' is the [[y-intercept]] of the line.
: ''x'' is the [[independent variable]] of the function ''y'' = ''f''(''x'').

The slope of the line through points &lt;math&gt;A(x_a, y_a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(x_b, y_b)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;x_a \neq x_b&lt;/math&gt;, is given by &lt;math&gt;m = (y_b - y_a)/(x_b - x_a)&lt;/math&gt; and the equation of this line can be written &lt;math&gt;y = m (x - x_a) + y_a&lt;/math&gt;.

In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R^2}&lt;/math&gt;, every line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (including vertical lines) is described by a linear equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;L=\{(x,y)\mid ax+by=c\} &lt;/math&gt;

with fixed real [[coefficient]]s ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' such that ''a'' and ''b'' are not both zero. Using this form, vertical lines correspond to the equations with ''b'' = 0.

There are many variant ways to write the equation of a line which can all be converted from one to another by algebraic manipulation. These forms (see [[Linear equation]] for other forms) are generally named by the type of information (data) about the line that is needed to write down the form. Some of the important data of a line is its slope, [[root of a function|x-intercept]], known points on the line and y-intercept.

The equation of the line passing through two different points &lt;math&gt;P_0( x_0, y_0 )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_1(x_1, y_1)&lt;/math&gt; may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;(y - y_0)(x_1 - x_0) = (y_1 - y_0)(x - x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.
If ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', this equation may be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;y=(x-x_0)\,\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}+y_0&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;y=x\,\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}+\frac{x_1y_0-x_0y_1}{x_1-x_0}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]], lines can ''not'' be described by a single linear equation, so they are frequently described by [[parametric equation]]s:
:&lt;math&gt; x = x_0 + at &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = y_0 + bt &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; z = z_0 + ct &lt;/math&gt;
where:
: ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are all functions of the independent variable ''t'' which ranges over the real numbers.
: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is any point on the line.
: ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are related to the slope of the line, such that the [[vector (geometric)|vector]] (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') is parallel to the line.

They may also be described as the simultaneous solutions of two [[linear equation]]s
:&lt;math&gt; a_1x+b_1y+c_1z-d_1=0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a_2x+b_2y+c_2z-d_2=0 &lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt; (a_1,b_1,c_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (a_2,b_2,c_2)&lt;/math&gt; are not proportional (the relations &lt;math&gt; a_1=ta_2, b_1=tb_2, c_1=tc_2 &lt;/math&gt; imply &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;). This follows since in three dimensions a single linear equation typically describes a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] and a line is what is common to two distinct intersecting planes.

====In normal form====
{{main|Hesse normal form}}
The ''normal form'' (also called the ''Hesse normal form'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Plane Analytic Geometry: With Introductory Chapters on the Differential Calculus|first=Maxime|last=Bôcher|publisher=H. Holt|year=1915|authorlink=Maxime Bôcher|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYkLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA44|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513124511/https://books.google.com/books?id=bYkLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA44|archivedate=2016-05-13|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; after the German mathematician [[Otto Hesse|Ludwig Otto Hesse]]), is based on the ''[[normal (geometry)|normal]] segment'' for a given line, which is defined to be the line segment drawn from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] perpendicular to the line. This segment joins the origin with the closest point on the line to the origin.  The normal form of the equation of a straight line on the plane is given by:
:: &lt;math&gt; y \sin \theta + x \cos \theta - p = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''θ'' is the angle of inclination of the normal segment (the oriented angle from the unit vector of the ''x'' axis to this segment), and ''p'' is the (positive) length of the normal segment. The normal form can be derived from the general form &lt;math&gt;ax+by=c&lt;/math&gt; by dividing all of the coefficients by

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{|c|}\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the slope-intercept and intercept forms, this form can represent any line but also requires only two finite parameters, ''θ'' and ''p'', to be specified. If ''p'' &gt; 0, then ''θ'' is uniquely defined modulo 2{{pi}}. On the other hand, if the line is through the origin (''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0), one drops the {{math|''c''/{{!}}''c''{{!}}}} term to compute sin''θ'' and cos''θ'', and ''θ'' is only defined modulo {{pi}}.

===In polar coordinates===
In [[polar coordinates]] on the Euclidean plane the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is expressed as:
::&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{mr\cos\theta+b}{\sin\theta},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the slope of the line and b is the ''y''-intercept.  When ''θ'' = 0 the graph will be undefined. The equation can be rewritten to eliminate discontinuities in this manner:
::&lt;math&gt;r\sin\theta=mr\cos\theta+b.&lt;/math&gt;
In polar coordinates on the Euclidean plane, the intercept form of the equation of a line that is non-horizontal, non-vertical, and does not pass through pole may be expressed as,
::&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{1}{\frac{\cos\theta}{x_o}+\frac{\sin\theta}{y_o}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_o&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_o&lt;/math&gt; represent the ''x'' and ''y'' intercepts respectively.
The above equation is not applicable for vertical and horizontal lines because in these cases one of the intercepts does not exist. Moreover, it is not applicable on lines passing through the pole since in this case, both ''x'' and ''y'' intercepts are zero (which is not allowed here since &lt;math&gt;x_o&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_o&lt;/math&gt; are denominators).
A vertical line that doesn't pass through the pole is given by the equation
::&lt;math&gt;r\cos\theta=x_o.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, a horizontal line that doesn't pass through the pole is given by the equation
::&lt;math&gt;r\sin\theta=y_o.&lt;/math&gt;
The equation of a line which passes through the pole is simply given as:
::&lt;math&gt;\tan\theta=m&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the slope of the line.

===As a vector equation===
The vector equation of the line through points A and B is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{OA} + \lambda\, \mathbf{AB}&lt;/math&gt; (where λ is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]).

If '''a''' is vector '''OA''' and '''b''' is vector '''OB''', then the equation of the line can be written: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{a} + \lambda (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})&lt;/math&gt;.

A ray starting at point ''A'' is described by limiting λ. One ray is obtained if λ ≥ 0, and the opposite ray comes from λ ≤ 0.

===In Euclidean space===

In [[three-dimensional space]], a [[first degree equation]] in the variables ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' defines a plane, so two such equations, provided the planes they give rise to are not parallel, define a line which is the intersection of the planes. More generally, in ''n''-dimensional space ''n''-1 first-degree equations in the ''n'' [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinate]] variables define a line under suitable conditions.

In more general [[Euclidean space]], '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (and analogously in every other [[affine space]]), the line ''L'' passing through two different points ''a'' and ''b'' (considered as vectors) is the subset
:&lt;math&gt;L = \{(1-t)\,a+t\,b\mid t\in\mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt;
The direction of the line is from ''a'' (''t'' = 0) to ''b'' (''t'' = 1), or in other words, in the direction of the vector ''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''. Different choices of ''a'' and ''b'' can yield the same line.

====Collinear points====
{{Main|Collinearity}}
Three points are said to be ''collinear'' if they lie on the same line. Three points ''[[general position|usually]]'' determine a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], but in the case of three collinear points this does ''not'' happen.

In [[affine coordinates]], in ''n''-dimensional space the points ''X''=(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), ''Y''=(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), and ''Z''=(''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are collinear if the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; \dots &amp; x_n  \\
 1 &amp; y_1 &amp; y_2 &amp; \dots &amp; y_n \\
 1 &amp; z_1 &amp; z_2 &amp; \dots &amp; z_n
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
has a [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] less than 3. In particular, for three points in the plane (''n'' = 2), the above matrix is square and the points are collinear if and only if its [[determinant]] is zero.

Equivalently for three points in a plane, the points are collinear if and only if the slope between one pair of points equals the slope between any other pair of points (in which case the slope between the remaining pair of points will equal the other slopes). By extension, ''k'' points in a plane are collinear if and only if  any (''k''–1) pairs of points have the same pairwise slopes.

In [[Euclidean geometry]], the [[Euclidean distance]] ''d''(''a'',''b'') between two points ''a'' and ''b'' may be used to express the collinearity between three points by:&lt;ref&gt;[[Alessandro Padoa]], Un nouveau système de définitions pour la géométrie euclidienne, [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], 1900&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]], [[The Principles of Mathematics]], p.410&lt;/ref&gt;
:The points ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are collinear if and only if ''d''(''x'',''a'') = ''d''(''c'',''a'') and ''d''(''x'',''b'') = ''d''(''c'',''b'') implies ''x''=''c''.
However, there are other notions of distance (such as the [[Manhattan distance]]) for which this property is not true.

In the geometries where the concept of a line is a [[primitive notion]], as may be the case in some [[synthetic geometry|synthetic geometries]], other methods of determining collinearity are needed.

=== Types of lines ===
In a sense,&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the [[collineation group]] acts [[transitive action|transitively]] on the set of lines.&lt;/ref&gt; all lines in Euclidean geometry are equal, in that, without coordinates, one can not tell them apart from one another. However, lines may play special roles with respect to other objects in the geometry and be divided into types according to that relationship. For instance, with respect to a [[Conic section|conic]] (a [[circle]], [[ellipse]], [[parabola]], or [[hyperbola]]), lines can be:
* [[tangent line]]s, which touch the conic at a single point;
* [[secant line]]s, which intersect the conic at two points and pass through its interior;
* exterior lines, which do not meet the conic at any point of the Euclidean plane; or
*a  [[Directrix of a conic section|directrix]], whose distance from a point helps to establish whether the point is on the conic.

In the context of determining [[parallel (geometry)|parallelism]] in Euclidean geometry, a [[transversal (geometry)|transversal]] is a line that intersects two other lines that may or not be parallel to each other.

For more general [[algebraic curve]]s, lines could also be:
* ''i''-secant lines, meeting the curve in ''i'' points counted without multiplicity, or
* [[asymptote]]s, which a curve approaches arbitrarily closely without touching it.
With respect to [[Euclidean triangle|triangle]]s we have:
* the [[Euler line]],
* the [[Simson line]]s, and
* [[central line (geometry)|central lines]].

For a [[convex polygon|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] with at most two parallel sides, the [[Newton line]] is the line that connects the midpoints of the two [[diagonal]]s.

For a [[hexagon]] with vertices lying on a conic we have the [[Pascal line]] and, in the special case where the conic is a pair of lines, we have the [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|Pappus line]].

[[Parallel (geometry)|Parallel lines]] are lines in the same plane that never cross. [[Line-line intersection|Intersecting lines]] share a single point in common. Coincidental lines coincide with each other&amp;mdash;every point that is on either one of them is also on the other.

[[Perpendicular lines]] are lines that intersect at [[right angle]]s.

In [[three-dimensional space]], [[skew lines]] are lines that are not in the same plane and thus do not intersect each other.

==In projective geometry==
{{further|Projective geometry}}
In many models of [[projective geometry]], the representation of a line rarely conforms to the notion of the "straight curve" as it is visualised in Euclidean geometry.  In [[elliptic geometry]] we see a typical example of this.&lt;ref&gt;Faber, Part III, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spherical representation of elliptic geometry, lines are represented by [[great circle]]s of a sphere with diametrically opposite points identified. In a different model of elliptic geometry, lines are represented by Euclidean [[plane (geometry)|planes]] passing through the origin. Even though these representations are visually distinct, they satisfy all the properties (such as, two points determining a unique line) that make them suitable representations for lines in this geometry.

==Extensions==

=== Ray ===&lt;!-- This section is linked (older copy) from: [[Tangent]], [[Ray (mathematics)]],  --&gt;
Given a line and any point ''A'' on it, we may consider ''A'' as decomposing this line into two parts.
Each such part is called a '''ray''' (or '''half-line''') and the point ''A'' is called its ''initial point''. The point A is considered to be a member of the ray.&lt;ref&gt;On occasion we may consider a ray without its initial point. Such rays are called ''open'' rays, in contrast to the typical ray which would be said to be ''closed''.&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, a ray consists of those points on a line passing through ''A'' and proceeding indefinitely, starting at ''A'', in one direction only along the line.  However, in order to use this concept of a ray in proofs a more precise definition is required.

Given distinct points ''A'' and ''B'', they determine a unique ray with initial point ''A''.  As two points define a unique line, this ray consists of all the points between ''A'' and ''B'' (including ''A'' and ''B'') and all the points ''C'' on the line through ''A'' and ''B'' such that ''B'' is between ''A'' and ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wylie, Jr.|1964|loc=pg. 59, Definition 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is, at times, also expressed as the set of all points ''C'' such that ''A'' is not between ''B'' and ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedoe|1988|loc=pg. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A point ''D'', on the line determined by ''A'' and ''B'' but not in the ray with initial point ''A'' determined by ''B'', will determine another ray with initial point ''A''. With respect to the ''AB'' ray, the ''AD'' ray is called the ''opposite ray''.
[[File:Ray (A, B, C).svg|500px|center|Ray]]

Thus, we would say that two different points, ''A'' and ''B'', define a line and a decomposition of this line into the [[disjoint union]] of an open segment {{open-open|''A'', ''B''}} and two rays, ''BC'' and ''AD'' (the point ''D'' is not drawn in the diagram, but is to the left of ''A'' on the line ''AB''). These are not opposite rays since they have different initial points.

In Euclidean geometry two rays with a common endpoint form an [[angle]].

The definition of a ray depends upon the notion of betweenness for points on a line. It follows that rays exist only for geometries for which this notion exists, typically [[Euclidean geometry]] or [[affine geometry]] over an [[ordered field]]. On the other hand, rays do not exist in [[projective geometry]] nor in a geometry over a non-ordered field, like the [[complex number]]s or any [[finite field]].

In [[topology]], a ray in a space ''X'' is a continuous embedding '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → ''X''. It is used to define the important concept of [[end (topology)|end]] of the space.

===Line segment===
{{main|Line segment}}

A [[line segment]] is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points and contains every point on the line between its end points.  Depending on how the line segment is defined, either of the two end points may or may not be part of the line segment.  Two or more line segments may have some of the same relationships as lines, such as being parallel, intersecting, or skew, but unlike lines they may be none of these, if they are [[coplanar]] and either do not intersect or are [[collinearity|collinear]].

===Geodesics===
{{main|Geodesics}}

The "shortness" and "straightness" of a line, interpreted as the property that the [[distance]] along the line between any two of its points is minimized (see [[triangle inequality]]), can be generalized and leads to the concept of [[geodesic]]s in [[metric space]]s.

[[Image:Lyapunov-fractal-AABAB.png|thumb|Generalized Lyapunov logistic fractal with iteration sequence AABAB, in the region [2, 4] × [2, 4].]]
[[Image:lyapunov-fractal.png|thumb|Generalized Lyapunov logistic fractal with iteration sequence BBBBBBAAAAAA, in the growth parameter region (''A'',''B'') in [3.4, 4.0] × [2.5, 3.4], known as ''Zircon Zity''.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''Lyapunov fractals''' (also known as '''Markus–Lyapunov fractals''') are [[bifurcation theory|bifurcational]] [[fractal]]s derived from an extension of the [[logistic map]] in which the degree of the growth of the population, ''r'', periodically switches between two values ''A'' and ''B''.

A [[Aleksandr Lyapunov|Lyapunov]] fractal is constructed by mapping the regions of stability and chaotic behaviour (measured using the [[Lyapunov exponent]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) in the ''a''&amp;minus;''b'' plane for given periodic sequences of ''a'' and ''b''. In the images, yellow corresponds to &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (stability), and blue corresponds to &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (chaos).

==Properties==
Lyapunov fractals are generally drawn for values of ''A'' and ''B'' in the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,4]&lt;/math&gt;. For larger values, the interval [0,1] is no longer stable, and the sequence is likely to be attracted by infinity, although convergent cycles of finite values continue to exist for some parameters. For all iteration sequences, the diagonal ''a = b'' is always the same as for the standard one parameter logistic function.

The sequence is usually started at the value 0.5, which is a [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] of the iterative function. The other (even complex valued) critical points of the iterative function during one entire round are those that pass through the value 0.5 in the first round. A convergent cycle must attract at least one critical point{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}; therefore all convergent cycles can be obtained by just shifting the iteration sequence, and keeping the starting value 0.5. In practice, shifting this sequence leads to changes in the fractal, as some branches get covered by others; notice for instance how the Lyapunov fractal for the iteration sequence AB is not perfectly symmetric with respect to ''a'' and ''b''.

==Algorithm for generating Lyapunov fractals==
An [[algorithm]], for computing the fractal is summarized as follows.

# Choose a string of As and Bs of any nontrivial length (e.g., AABAB).
# Construct the sequence &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; formed by successive terms in the string, repeated as many times as necessary.
# Choose a point &lt;math&gt;(a,b) \in [0,4] \times [0,4]&lt;/math&gt;.
# Define the function &lt;math&gt;r_n = a&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;S_n = A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r_n = b&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;S_n = B&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;x_0 = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;, and compute the iterates &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = r_n x_n (1 - x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Compute the Lyapunov exponent:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} {1 \over N} \sum_{n = 1}^N \log \left|{dx_{n+1} \over dx_n}\right| = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} {1 \over N} \sum_{n = 1}^N \log |r_n (1 - 2x_n)|&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;In practice, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is approximated by choosing a suitably large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and dropping the first summand as &lt;math&gt;r_0 (1 - 2x_0) = r_n \cdot 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x_0=0.5&lt;/math&gt;.
# Color the point &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; according to the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; obtained.
# Repeat steps (3–7) for each point in the image plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19845">A '''mathematical joke''' is a form of [[humor]] which relies on aspects of [[mathematics]] or a [[stereotype]] of [[mathematician]]s to derive humor. The humor may come from a [[pun]], or from a double meaning of a mathematical term, or from a lay person's misunderstanding of a mathematical concept. Mathematician and author [[John Allen Paulos]] in his book ''Mathematics and Humor'' described several ways that mathematics, generally considered a dry, formal activity, overlaps with humor, a loose, irreverent activity: both are forms of "intellectual play"; both have "logic, pattern, rules, structure"; and both are "economical and explicit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematics and Humor|author=John Allen Paulos|authorlink=John Allen Paulos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some performers combine mathematics and jokes to entertain and/or teach math.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathscareers.org.uk/viewItem.cfm?cit_id=383215 |title=Matt Parker, math stand-up comedian |publisher=Mathscareers.org.uk |date=2011-08-04 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/dara_o_briain_school_hard_sums/episodes/ |title=Dara O'Briain: School of hard sums |publisher=Comedy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schimmrich |first=Steven |url=http://hudsonvalleygeologist.blogspot.com/2011/05/dave-gorman-math-stand-up-comedy.html |title=Dave Gorman – stand-up math comedy |publisher= |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:New cuyama.jpg|thumb|Humorously inappropriate use of numbers on a sign in [[New Cuyama, California]].]]

Humor of mathematicians may be classified into the esoteric and exoteric categories. Esoteric jokes rely on the intrinsic knowledge of mathematics and its terminology. Exoteric jokes are intelligible to the outsiders, and most of them compare mathematicians with representatives of other disciplines or with common folk.&lt;ref name=redu&gt;Paul Renteln, [[Alan Dundes]], [http://www.ams.org/notices/200501/fea-dundes.pdf Foolproof: A Sampling of Mathematical Folk Humor], NOTICES OF THE AMS, VOLUME 52, NUMBER 1, 2005, pp. 24-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pun-based jokes==
Some jokes use a mathematical term with a second non-technical meaning as the punchline of a joke.

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Q. What's purple and commutes?
A. An abelian grape. (A pun on ''[[abelian group]]''.)&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Occasionally, multiple mathematical puns appear in the same jest:

{{quote|When [[Noah's Ark|Noah sends his animals]] to go forth and multiply, a pair of snakes replies "We can't multiply, we're [[Vipera berus|adders]]" &amp;ndash; so [[Noah]] builds them a [[log table]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ldX0FkgurzoC&amp;pg=PA261 | title = Science Askew : a light-hearted look at the scientific world | isbn = 9780750307147 | last1 = Simanek | first1 = Donald E. | last2 = Holden | first2 = John C. | date = 2001-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This invokes four [[double meaning]]s: [[Vipera berus|adder (snake)]] vs. [[addition]] (algebraic operation);  [[reproduction|multiplication (biological reproduction)]] vs. [[multiplication]] (algebraic operation); [[logging|log]] (cut [[tree trunk]]) vs. [[logarithm|log]] (logarithm); multiplication is done by adding logs (mathematical logarithm); finally, table (set of facts) vs. table (piece of furniture).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e1CwC4paHAsC&amp;pg=PA65 | title = The Language of Comic Narratives | isbn = 9783110208337 | author1 = Ermida | first1 = Isabel | date = 2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other jokes create a double meaning from a direct calculation involving facetious variable names, such as this retold from ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=71753 | title=Quick and Witty! | work=Physics Forums | date=April 6, 2005 | accessdate=February 28, 2013 | author=polyb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Person 1: What's the integral of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;cabin&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to cabin?
Person 2: A log cabin.
Person 1: No, a houseboat; you forgot to add the C!&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5NwF-Gdgg9YC&amp;pg=PA145 | title = Thomas Pynchon | isbn = 9781438116112 | author1 = Bloom | first1 = Harold | date = 2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The first part of this joke relies on the fact that the primitive (formed when finding the [[antiderivative]]) of the function 1/''x'' is [[Natural logarithm|log(''x'')]]. The second part is then based on the fact that the antiderivative is actually a class of functions, requiring the inclusion of a [[constant of integration]], usually denoted as ''C''—something which calculus students may forget. Thus, the indefinite integral of 1/cabin is "log(cabin)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''C''", or "A [[log cabin]] plus the [[sea]]", i.e., "A [[houseboat]]".

==Jokes with numeral bases==

Some jokes depend on ambiguity of numeral bases. 

{{quote|There are only 10 types of people in the world: those who understand [[binary numeral system|binary]], and those who don't.}}

This joke mocks phrases that begin with "there are two types of people in the world..." and relies on an ambiguous meaning of the expression 10, which in the [[binary numeral system]] is equal to the decimal number 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kELa1UaugxUC&amp;pg=PA31 | title = The Linguistic Analysis of Jokes | isbn = 9780203406953 | author1 = Ritchie | first1 = Graeme | date = 2002-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many extensions to the joke, such as "There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, those who don't and those who didn't realize the joke was in [[ternary numeral system|base three]]."

Another pun using different [[radix|radices]], asks:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Q. Why do mathematicians confuse [[Halloween]] and [[Christmas]]?
A. Because 31 [[Octal|Oct]] = 25 [[Decimal|Dec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=r8i-4En_aa4C&amp;pg=PA385 | title = Applying Uml and Patterns | isbn = 9780130925695 | author1 = Larman | first1 = Craig | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e1VFN1V1zAAC&amp;pg=PA78 | title = Are You a Geek? | isbn = 9780440336280 | author1 = Collins | first1 = Tim | date = 2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The play on words lies in the similarity of the abbreviation for October/[[Octal]] and December/Decimal, and the coincidence that both equal the same amount (&lt;math&gt;31_8 = 25_{10}&lt;/math&gt;).

==Imaginary and complex numbers==
In mathematics, the [[imaginary number]] ''i'' is a number such that:

&lt;math display=block&gt;i^2 = -1 &lt;/math&gt;

A [[complex number]] is a quantity which can be written as the sum of a [[real number]] plus an imaginary number.

While a pun has been based upon the constant's name ("complex numbers are all fun and games until someone loses an i"), most jokes treat an imaginary number as if it were a fictional entity. A telephone [[intercept message]] of "you have dialed an imaginary number, please rotate your handset ninety degrees and try again" is a typical example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQJCfjcAn2EC&amp;pg=PA48 |title=In the Lab |author=Elizabeth Longmier |date= 2007-05-01|accessdate=2013-06-19|isbn=9781430322160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular example is "What did i say to pi? Be rational. What did pi say to i? Get real."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathnotations.blogspot.com/2007/08/sequel-to-what-did-pi-say-to-i-and-more.html |title=Math Notations|date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotypes of mathematicians==
Some jokes are based on stereotypes of mathematicians tending to think in complicated, abstract terms, causing them to lose touch with the "real world". These compare mathematicians to [[physicist]]s, [[engineer]]s, or the [[Soft science|"soft" sciences]] in a form similar to [[an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]], showing the other scientist doing something practical, while the mathematician proposes a theoretically valid but physically nonsensical solution.

{{quote|A physicist, a biologist and a mathematician are sitting in a street café watching people entering and leaving the house on the other side of the street. First they see two people entering the house. Time passes. After a while they notice three people leaving the house. The physicist says, "The measurement wasn't accurate." The biologist says, "They must have reproduced." The mathematician says, "If one more person enters the house then it will be empty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=16MjPAH_CBYC&amp;pg=PA542 | title = Calculus with Maple Labs : early transcendentals | isbn = 9781842650745 | last1 = Krawcewicz | first1 = Wiesław | last2 = Rai | first2 = B. | date = 2003-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mathematicians are also shown as averse to making hasty [[generalization]]s from a small amount of data, even if some form of generalization seems plausible:

{{quote|An astronomer, a physicist and a mathematician are on a train in [[Scotland]]. The astronomer looks out of the window, sees a [[black sheep]] standing in a field, and remarks, "How odd. All the sheep in Scotland are black!" "''No, no, no!''" says the physicist. "Only ''some'' Scottish sheep are black." The mathematician rolls his eyes at his companions' muddled thinking and says, "In Scotland, there is at least one sheep, at least one side of which appears to be black from here some of the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PcqiXD_BxA4C&amp;pg=PA286 | title = Concepts of Modern Mathematics | isbn = 9780486134956 | author1 = Stewart | first1 = Ian | year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A classic joke involving stereotypes is the "Dictionary of Definitions of Terms Commonly Used in Math Lectures".&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucdenver.edu/~wcherowi/mathmajor/archive/def.html "Dictionary of Definitions of Terms Commonly Used in Math lectures."]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include "Trivial: If I have to show you how to do this, you're in the wrong class" and "Similarly: At least one line of the proof of this case is the same as before."

==Non-mathematician's math==
This category of jokes comprises those that exploit common misunderstandings of mathematics, or the expectation that most people have only a basic mathematical education, if any.

{{quote|A museum visitor was admiring a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' fossil, and asked a nearby museum employee how old it was. "That skeleton's sixty-five million and three years, two months and eighteen days old," the employee replied. "How can you be so precise?" she asked. "Well, when I started working here, I asked a scientist the exact same question, and he said it was sixty-five million years old—and that was three years, two months and eighteen days ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ghJaYi3FELMC&amp;pg=PT14 | title = Proofiness | isbn = 9781101443507 | author1 = Seife | first1 = Charles | date = 2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The joke is that the employee fails to understand the scientist's implication of the [[Significant figures|uncertainty]] in the age of the fossil and uses [[false precision]].

==Mock  mathematics==
A form of mathematical humor comes from using mathematical tools (both abstract symbols and physical objects such as calculators) in various ways which transgress their intended scope.  These constructions are generally devoid of any substantial mathematical content, besides some basic arithmetic.

===Mock mathematical reasoning===
A set of [[equivocal]] jokes applies mathematical reasoning to situations where it is not entirely valid. Many of these are based on a combination of well-known quotes and basic [[logic]]al constructs such as [[syllogism]]s:

{|
|''Premise I:'' || Knowledge is power.
|-
| ''Premise II:'' || Power corrupts.
|-
| ''Conclusion:'' || Therefore, knowledge corrupts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=W-9NNTtd9NUC&amp;pg=PA143 | title = Plato's Sun | isbn = 9780802038098 | author1 = Lawless | first1 = Andrew | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Another set of jokes relate to the absence of mathematical reasoning, or misinterpretation of conventional notation:

&lt;math display=block&gt;\left( \lim_{x\to 8^+} \frac{1}{x-8} = \infty \right) \Rightarrow \left( \lim_{x\to 3^+} \frac{1}{x-3} = \omega \right)&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the limit as ''x'' goes to 8 from above is a sideways 8 or the infinity sign, in the same way that the limit as ''x'' goes to three from above is a sideways 3 or the Greek letter [[omega]] (conventionally used to notate the smallest infinite [[ordinal number]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mgccl.com/2008/02/21/a-mathematical-look-into-the-limit-joke |title=A mathematical look into the limit joke |accessdate=2008-04-19 |last=Xu |first=Chao |date=2008-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224020052/http://mgccl.com/2008/02/21/a-mathematical-look-into-the-limit-joke |archivedate=2008-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[anomalous cancellation]] is a kind of arithmetic procedural error that gives a numerically correct answer:

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{64}{16} = \frac{\not64}{1\!\!{\not6}} = \frac{4}{1} = 4&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\frac{1}{x} = \frac{\not\mathrm{d}}{\not\mathrm{d}x}\frac{1}{x} = \frac{}{x}\frac{1}{x} = -\frac{1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Mathematical fallacies===

A number of [[mathematical fallacies]] are part of mathematical humorous folklore. For example:
&lt;math display=block&gt;
\begin{align}
b        &amp;= a \\
ab       &amp;= a^2 \\
ab - b^2 &amp;= a^2 - b^2 \\
b(a - b) &amp;= (a + b)(a - b) \\
b        &amp;= a + b \\
b        &amp;= b + b \\
b        &amp;= 2b \\
1        &amp;= 2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
This appears to prove that {{math|1=1 = 2}}, but uses [[division by zero]] to produce the result.&lt;ref&gt;Harro Heuser: ''Lehrbuch der Analysis – Teil 1'', 6th edition, Teubner 1989, {{isbn|978-3-8351-0131-9}}, page 51 (German).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jokes attempt a seemingly plausible, but effectively impossible, mathematical operation.  For example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Pi goes on and on and on ...&lt;br&gt;
And e is just as cursed.&lt;br&gt;
I wonder: Which is larger&lt;br&gt;
When their digits are reversed? &lt;ref name="JFF"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pi goes on and on and on … |url=http://math.ucdenver.edu/~wcherowi/mathmajor/jff.html |website=JUST FOR FUN |publisher=Math Majors Matter |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To reverse the digits of a number's [[decimal expansion]], we have to start at the last digit and work backwards.  However, that's not practical if the expansion never ends, as for &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

===Humorous numbers===
Many numbers have been given [[Inherently_funny_word#Funny_numbers|humorous names]], either as pure numbers or as [[List of humorous units of measurement|units of measurement]]. Some examples:

[[Sagan (number)|Sagan]] has been defined as "billions and billions", a metric of the number of stars in the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E3DF143EF934A25757C0A962958260 ON LANGUAGE; Footprints on the Infobahn], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 17, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numericana.com/answer/sagan.htm Sizing up the Universe – Stars, Sand and Nucleons – Numericana]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jenny's constant'' has been defined as &lt;math&gt;J = (7^{e - 1/e} - 9) \cdot \pi^2 = 867.5309\ldots.&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|A182369}}, from the pop song [[867-5309/Jenny]], which concerns the telephone number 867-5309.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/JennysConstant.html |title=Jenny's Constant |publisher=Wolfram MathWorld |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical constant [[42 (number)|42]] appears throughout the [[Douglas Adams]] trilogy ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', where it is portrayed as "the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gill|first=Peter|title=42: Douglas Adams' Amazingly Accurate Answer to Life the Universe and Everything|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/03/douglas-adams-42-hitchhiker?INTCMP=SRCH|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=2011-04-03|location=London|date=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number appears as a fixed value in the TIFF image file format and its derivatives (including for example the [[ISO]] standard [[TIFF/EP]]) where the content of bytes 2–3 is defined as 42: "An arbitrary but carefully chosen number that further identifies the file as a TIFF file".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual
 |     author = Aldus/Microsoft
 |      title = TIFF
 |    section = 1) Structure
 |    version = Revision 5.0
 |  publisher = Aldus Corporation and Microsoft Corporation
 |       date = 1999-08-09
 |        url = http://cool-palimpsest.stanford.edu/bytopic/imaging/std/tiff5.html
 | accessdate = 2009-06-29
 |      quote = The number 42 was chosen for its deep philosophical significance.
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calculator spelling===
{{main|Calculator spelling}}

Calculator spelling is the formation of words and phrases by displaying a number and turning the [[calculator]] upside down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vIxed-m4_bQC&amp;pg=PA48 | title = The Amazing Mathematical Amusement Arcade | isbn = 9780521269803 | author1 = Bolt | first1 = Brian | date = 1984-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jest may be formulated as a mathematical problem where the result, when read upside down, appears to be an identifiable phrase like "[[Shell Oil|ShELL OIL]]" or "[[Esso]]" using [[seven-segment display character representations]] where the open-top "4" is an inverted 'h' and '5' looks like 'S'. Other letters can be used as numbers too with 8 and 9 representing B and G, respectively.

===Limericks===
A mathematical limerick is an expression which, when read aloud, matches the form of a [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]. The following example is attributed to [[Leigh Mercer]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/mayhem.htm |title=Math Mayhem |publisher=Lhup.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;math display=block&gt;\frac{12 + 144 + 20 + 3 \sqrt{4}}{7} + (5 \times 11) = 9^2+0&lt;/math&gt;
This is read as follows:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
A [[dozen]], a [[Gross (unit)|gross]], and a [[20 (number)|score]]
Plus three times the square root of four
Divided by seven
Plus five times eleven
Is nine squared and not a bit more.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Doughnut and coffee mug topology joke==
[[Image:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|right|A continuous deformation (homeomorphism) of a coffee cup into a doughnut ([[torus]]) and back.]]
An oft-repeated joke is that [[topologist]]s cannot tell a [[coffee cup]] from a [[doughnut]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHBj2oaSALoC&amp;pg=PA204 |title=Differential Equations: A Dynamical Systems Approach : Higher-Dimensional Systems |date=1995-03-30 |accessdate=2011-06-29|isbn=9780387943770|author1=West|first1=Beverly H}}&lt;/ref&gt; since a sufficiently pliable doughnut could be reshaped (by a [[homeomorphism]]) to the form of a cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while shrinking the hole into a handle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6143">In [[differential topology]], a branch of mathematics, a '''Mazur manifold''' is a contractible, [[compact space|compact]], smooth 4-dimensional [[manifold]] (with boundary) which is not [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to the standard [[4-ball (mathematics)|4-ball]].  The boundary of a Mazur manifold is necessarily a [[homology sphere|homology 3-sphere]].

Frequently the term '''Mazur manifold''' is restricted to a special class of the above definition:  4-manifolds that have a [[handle decomposition]] containing exactly three handles: a single 0-handle, a single 1-handle and single 2-handle. This is equivalent to saying the manifold must be of the form &lt;math&gt;S^1 \times D^3&lt;/math&gt; union a 2-handle.  An observation of Mazur's shows that the [[Double (manifold)|double]] of such manifolds is [[Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to &lt;math&gt;S^4&lt;/math&gt; with the standard smooth structure.

== History ==

[[Barry Mazur]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mazur | first=Barry | title=A note on some contractible 4-manifolds | journal=[[Ann. of Math.]] | volume=73 | year=1961 | pages=221–228 | mr=0125574 | doi=10.2307/1970288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Valentin Poenaru&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Valentin | last=Poenaru | title=Les decompositions de l'hypercube en produit topologique | journal=Bull. Soc. Math. France | volume=88 | year=1960 | pages=113–129 | mr=0125572 | url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=BSMF_1960__88__113_0}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered these manifolds simultaneously. Akbulut and Kirby showed that the [[homology sphere|Brieskorn homology spheres]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma(2,5,7) &lt;/math&gt;,   &lt;math&gt; \Sigma(3,4,5)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma(2,3,13)&lt;/math&gt; are boundaries of Mazur manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Selman | last1=Akbulut | first2=Robion | last2=Kirby | title=Mazur manifolds | journal=Michigan Math. J. | volume=26 | year=1979 | pages=259–284 | issue=3 |mr=0544597 | doi=10.1307/mmj/1029002261}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results were later generalized to other contractible manifolds by Casson, Harer and Stern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Andrew | last1=Casson | first2=John L. | last2=Harer | title=Some homology lens spaces which bound rational homology balls | mr=0634760 | journal=[[Pacific J. Math.]] | volume=96 | issue=1 | year=1981 | pages=23–36 | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102734944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Henry Clay | last=Fickle | title=Knots, Z-Homology 3-spheres and contractible 4-manifolds | pages=467–493 | journal=Houston J. Math. | volume=10 | issue=4 | year=1984 | mr=0774711}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=R.Stern | title=Some Brieskorn spheres which bound contractible manifolds | journal=Notices Amer. Math. Soc. | volume=25 | year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Mazur manifolds is also an example of an [[Akbulut cork]] which can be used to construct exotic 4-manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Selman | last=Akbulut | title=A fake compact contractible 4-manifold | journal=[[J. Differential Geom.]] | volume=33 | year=1991 | pages=335–356 | issue=2 | mr=1094459 | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214446320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazur manifolds have been used by Fintushel and Stern&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fintushel | first1=Ronald | last2=Stern | first2=Ronald J. | title=An exotic free involution on &lt;math&gt;S^{4}&lt;/math&gt; | journal=[[Ann. of Math.]] | volume=113 | year=1981 | issue=2 | pages=357–365 | mr=0607896 | doi=10.2307/2006987}}&lt;/ref&gt; to construct exotic actions of a group of order 2 on the [[n-sphere|4-sphere]].

Mazur's discovery was surprising for several reasons:

:* Every smooth homology sphere in dimension &lt;math&gt;n \geq 5&lt;/math&gt; is homeomorphic to the boundary of a compact contractible smooth manifold. This follows from the work of Kervaire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kervaire | first=Michel A. | title=Smooth homology spheres and their fundamental groups | journal=[[Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.]] | volume=144 | year=1969 | pages=67–72 | mr=0253347 | doi=10.1090/S0002-9947-1969-0253347-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[h-cobordism]] theorem.  Slightly more strongly, every smooth homology 4-sphere is diffeomorphic to the boundary of a compact contractible smooth 5-manifold (also by the work of Kervaire). But not every homology 3-sphere is diffeomorphic to the boundary of a contractible compact smooth 4-manifold. For example, the [[Homology sphere|Poincaré homology sphere]] does not bound such a 4-manifold because the [[Rokhlin invariant|Rochlin invariant]] provides an obstruction.

:* The [[h-cobordism|h-cobordism Theorem]] implies that, at least in dimensions &lt;math&gt;n \geq 6&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique contractible &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-manifold with simply-connected boundary, where uniqueness is up to diffeomorphism. This manifold is the unit ball &lt;math&gt;D^n&lt;/math&gt;.  It's an open problem as to whether or not &lt;math&gt;D^5&lt;/math&gt; admits an exotic smooth structure, but by the h-cobordism theorem, such an exotic smooth structure, if it exists, must restrict to an exotic smooth structure on &lt;math&gt;S^4&lt;/math&gt;.  Whether or not &lt;math&gt;S^4&lt;/math&gt; admits an exotic smooth structure is equivalent to another open problem, the smooth [[Generalized Poincaré conjecture|Poincaré conjecture in dimension four]]. Whether or not &lt;math&gt;D^4&lt;/math&gt; admits an exotic smooth structure is another open problem, closely linked to the [[Schoenflies problem]] in dimension four.

== Mazur's Observation ==

Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a Mazur manifold that is constructed as &lt;math&gt;S^1 \times D^3&lt;/math&gt; union a 2-handle. Here is a sketch of Mazur's argument that the [[Double (manifold)|double]] of such a Mazur manifold is &lt;math&gt;S^4&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;M \times [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a contractible 5-manifold constructed as &lt;math&gt;S^1 \times D^4&lt;/math&gt; union a 2-handle.  The 2-handle can be unknotted since the attaching map is a framed knot in the 4-manifold &lt;math&gt;S^1 \times S^3&lt;/math&gt;.  So &lt;math&gt;S^1 \times D^4&lt;/math&gt; union the 2-handle is diffeomorphic to &lt;math&gt;D^5&lt;/math&gt;. The boundary of &lt;math&gt;D^5&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;S^4&lt;/math&gt;. But the boundary of &lt;math&gt;M \times [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Double (manifold)|double]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

Randić was born in the city of [[Belgrade]], where his parents, originally from [[Kostrena]] (Croatian Primorje – Region in the northern Adriatic), lived at the time. Kostrena is well known by its maritime tradition, shipowners and seamen. Randic's ancestors were sailing ship owners as well as ship captains. His parents moved to Zagreb in 1941, where he continued his education.
After finishing Gymnasium in Zagreb, he studied Theoretical Physics at the [[University of Zagreb]] during 1949–1953 and studied for Ph. D degree at the [[University of Cambridge]], England (1954–1958).

==Academic career==
From 1960 to 1970 he was at the [[Ruđer Bošković Institute]] in Zagreb, Croatia, where he founded the Theoretical Chemistry Group.  During 1971–1980 he was visiting various universities in USA including Johns Hopkins, MIT, Harvard, Tufts, and Cornell.  With 1973 his research oriented towards application of Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory in particular to characterization of molecules and bio-molecules.  During 1980 to 1997 he was professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at [[Drake University]], Des Moines, Iowa.  During the past 15 years he is spending three months each year at the [[National Institute of Chemistry]], Ljubljana, Slovenia collaborating with scientists from its Laboratory for Chemometrics.

==Research and achievements==
Randić has been a major contributor to the development of [[mathematical chemistry]], in particular to the development and use of molecular descriptors based on the use of Graph Theory. In 1975 he introduced the [[Randić index]], the first connectivity index.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=M.|last=Randić|title=Characterization of molecular branching|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=97|issue=23|year=1975|pages=6609–6615|doi=10.1021/ja00856a001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a corresponding member of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://info.hazu.hr/corresponding_members | title=Corresponding members | work=hazu.hr | publisher=[[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] | accessdate=2009-09-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225034825/http://info.hazu.hr/corresponding_members | archivedate=2010-02-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and founder of the [[International Academy of Mathematical Chemistry]], the seat of which is in Dubrovnik, Croatia.   With year 2000 his research has been mostly shifted towards Bioinformatics, with particular emphasis on graphical representation and numerical characterization of DNA, proteins and proteome, though his fascination with Kekulé valence structures and aromaticity remains undiminished.  He is Honorary Member of The [[Croatian Chemical Society]], The [[International Academy of Mathematical Chemistry]] and The National Institute of Chemistry, Ljubljana, Slovenia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2706">'''Morrie's law''' is the [[trigonometric identity]]

:&lt;math&gt; \cos(20^\circ) \cdot \cos(40^\circ) \cdot \cos(80^\circ) = \frac{1}{8}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is a [[special case]] of the more general identity

:&lt;math&gt; 2^n \cdot \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos(2^k \alpha) = \frac{\sin(2^n \alpha)}{\sin(\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''n'' = 3 and α = 20° and the fact that 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\sin(160^\circ)}{\sin(20^\circ)} = \frac{\sin(180^\circ-20^\circ)}{\sin(20^\circ)} = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

since 

:&lt;math&gt; \sin(180^\circ-x) = \sin(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The name is due to the physicist [[Richard Feynman]], who used to refer to the identity under that name. Feynman picked that name because he learned it during his childhood from a boy with the name Morrie Jacobs and afterwards remembered it for all of his life.&lt;ref&gt;W. A. Beyer, J. D. Louck, and [[Doron Zeilberger|D. Zeilberger]], ''A Generalization of a Curiosity that Feynman Remembered All His Life'', Math. Mag. 69, 43–44, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar identity for the sine function also holds:

:&lt;math&gt; \sin(20^\circ) \cdot \sin(40^\circ) \cdot \sin(80^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt 3}{8}.&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, dividing the second identity by the first, the following identity is evident:

:&lt;math&gt; \tan(20^\circ) \cdot \tan(40^\circ) \cdot \tan(80^\circ) = \sqrt 3 = \tan(60^\circ).&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
Recall the double angle formula for the sine function

:&lt;math&gt; \sin(2 \alpha) = 2 \sin(\alpha) \cos(\alpha). &lt;/math&gt;

Solve for &lt;math&gt; \cos(\alpha) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \cos(\alpha)=\frac{\sin(2 \alpha)}{2 \sin(\alpha)}. &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\cos(2 \alpha) &amp; = \frac{\sin(4 \alpha)}{2 \sin(2 \alpha)} \\[6pt]
\cos(4 \alpha) &amp; = \frac{\sin(8 \alpha)}{2 \sin(4 \alpha)} \\
&amp; {}\,\,\,  \vdots \\
\cos(2^{n-1} \alpha) &amp; = \frac{\sin(2^{n} \alpha)}{2 \sin(2^{n-1} \alpha)}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying all of these expressions together yields:

:&lt;math&gt; \cos(\alpha) \cos(2 \alpha) \cos(4 \alpha) \cdots \cos(2^{n-1} \alpha)=
\frac{\sin(2 \alpha)}{2 \sin(\alpha)} \cdot \frac{\sin(4 \alpha)}{2 \sin(2 \alpha)} \cdot \frac{\sin(8 \alpha)}{2 \sin(4 \alpha)} \cdots \frac{\sin(2^{n} \alpha)}{2 \sin(2^{n-1} \alpha)}. &lt;/math&gt;

The intermediate numerators and denominators cancel leaving only the first denominator, a power of 2 and the final numerator. Note that there are ''n'' terms in both sides of the expression. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos(2^k \alpha)=\frac{\sin(2^n \alpha)}{2^n \sin(\alpha)}, &lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to the generalization of Morrie's law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62612">'''Perceptual control theory''' ('''PCT''') is a model of [[behavior]] based on the principles of [[negative feedback]], but differing in important respects from [[Control theory|engineering control theory]]. Results of PCT experiments have demonstrated that an organism controls neither its own behavior, nor external environmental variables, but rather its own perceptions of those variables. Actions are not controlled, they are varied so as to cancel the effects that unpredictable environmental disturbances would otherwise have on controlled perceptions. As a catch-phrase of the field puts it, "behavior is the control of perception." PCT demonstrates circular causation in a negative feedback loop closed through the environment. This fundamentally contradicts the classical notion of linear causation of behavior by stimuli, in which environmental stimuli are thought to cause behavioral responses, mediated (according to [[cognitive psychology]]) by intervening cognitive processes.  &lt;sup&gt;[[citation needed]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Numerous computer simulations of specific behavioral situations demonstrate its efficacy,&lt;ref&gt;For example in [http://mindreadings.com/demos.htm this collection].&lt;/ref&gt; with extremely high correlations to observational data (0.95 or better), which are vanishingly rare in the so-called 'soft' sciences.&lt;ref name=Runkel.cast/&gt; While the adoption of PCT in the scientific community has not been widespread, it has been applied not only in [[experimental psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], but also in sociology, linguistics, and a number of other fields, and has led to a method of psychotherapy called the [[method of levels]].

==The place of purpose (intention) and causation in psychology==

A tradition from Aristotle through William James recognizes that behavior is ''purposeful'' rather than merely reactive. However, the only evidence for intentions was subjective. Behaviorists following [[Wilhelm Wundt|Wundt]], [[Edward Thorndike|Thorndyke]], [[John B. Watson|Watson]], and others rejected introspective reports as data for an objective science of psychology. Only observable behavior could be admitted as data.&lt;ref&gt;"The behaviorist asks: Why don't we make what we can observe the real field of psychology? Let us limit ourselves to things that can be observed, and formulate laws concerning only those things. Now what can we observe? We can observe behavior—what the organism does or says." Watson, J.B. (1924). ''Behaviorism''. New York: People's Institute Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

There follows from this stance the assumption that environmental events (stimuli) cause behavioral actions (responses). This assumption persists in [[cognitive psychology]], which interposes [[cognitive maps]] and other postulated [[information processing]] between stimulus and response, but otherwise retains the assumption of linear causation from environment to behavior.&lt;ref name=Marken2009rev&gt;{{cite journal | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | author-link = | title =You say you had a revolution: Methodological foundations of closed-loop psychology | journal =Review of General Psychology | volume =13 | issue =2 | pages =137–145 | publisher = | location = | date =June 2009 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi =10.1037/a0015106 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, more specific reason for psychologists' rejecting notions of purpose or intention was that they could not see how a goal (a state that did not yet exist) could cause the behavior that led to it. PCT resolves these philosophical arguments about [[teleology]] because it provides a model of the functioning of organisms in which purpose has objective status without recourse to [[introspection]], and in which causation is circular around [[feedback loops]].&lt;ref name=Runkel-PLT&gt;{{cite book | last =Runkel | first =Philip J. | author-link = | title =People as living things | publisher =Living Control Systems Publishing | edition = | date =2003 | location =Hayward, CA | pages =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-9740155-0-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

PCT has roots in insights of [[Claude Bernard]] and 20th century [[control systems engineering]] and [[cybernetics]]. It was originated as such, and given its present form and experimental methodology, by [[William T. Powers]].&lt;ref name=Runkel.cast&gt;{{cite book | last =Runkel | first =Philip J. | author-link = | title =Casting nets and testing specimens: Two grand methods of psychology | publisher =Praeger | edition = | date =1990 | location =New York | page =103 | isbn =0-275-93533-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cziko.TWD&gt;{{Citation | last =Cziko | first =Gary | author-link = | title =The things we do: Using the lessons of Bernard and Darwin to understand the what, how, and why of our behavior | place =Cambridge, MA | publisher =MIT Press | year =2000 | page =9 | isbn =0-262-03277-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powers recognized that to be purposeful implies control, and that the concepts and methods of engineered control systems could be applied to biological control systems. A key insight is that the variable that is controlled is not the output of the system (the behavioral actions), but its input, that is, a sensed and transformed function of some state of the environment that could be affected by the control system's output. Because some of these sensed and transformed inputs appear as consciously perceived aspects of the environment, Powers labelled the controlled variable "perception". The theory came to be known as "Perceptual Control Theory" or PCT rather than "Control Theory Applied to Psychology" because control theorists often assert or assume that it is the system's output that is controlled.&lt;ref name=Astrom&gt;{{cite book | last =Astrom | first =Karl J. | last2 =Murray | first2 =Richard M. | title =Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers | publisher =Princeton University Press | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2008 | location = | pages = | language = | url =http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM08/pdf/am08-complete_28Sep12.pdf | doi = | id = | isbn =0-691-13576-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In PCT it is the internal representation of the state of some variable in the environment—a "perception" in everyday language—that is controlled.&lt;ref&gt;For additional information about the history of PCT, see interviews with William T. Powers in the "Audio" section under "External links".&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principles of PCT were first published by Powers, Clark, and MacFarland as a "general feedback theory of behavior" in 1960,&lt;ref name=PCM1960&gt;{{cite journal | last =Powers | first =William T. | last2 =Clark | first2 =R.K. | last3 =McFarland | first3 =R.L. | title =A general feedback theory of human behavior (Part I) | journal =Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume =11 | issue =1 | pages =71–88 | publisher = | location = | date =1960 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.2466/pms.1960.11.1.71| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }} and {{cite journal | last =Powers | first =William T. | last2 =Clark | first2 =R.K. | last3 =McFarland | first3 =R.L. | title =A general feedback theory of human behavior (Part II) | journal =Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume =11 | issue =3 | pages =309–323 | publisher = | location = | date =1960 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.2466/pms.1960.11.3.309| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }} [Reprinted in {{citation | last =Bertalanffy | first =Ludwig von | last2 =Rapoport | first2 =Anatol | title =General Systems: Yearbook of the Society for General Systems Research | place =Ann Arbor, Michigan | publisher =Society for General Systems Research | series = | volume =5 | orig-year =1960 | year = | month= | edition = | chapter = | chapter-url = | page = | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }},  pages 63-73, 75-83.

==Example==

A simple negative feedback control system is a [[cruise control]] system for a car. A cruise control system has a sensor which "perceives" speed as the rate of spin of the drive shaft directly connected to the wheels. It also has a driver-adjustable 'goal' specifying a particular speed. The sensed speed is continuously compared against the specified speed by a device (called a "comparator") which subtracts the currently sensed input value from the stored goal value. The difference (the error signal) determines the throttle setting (the accelerator depression), so that the engine output is continuously varied to prevent the speed of the car from increasing or decreasing from that desired speed as environmental conditions change. This type of classical negative feedback control was worked out by engineers in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="black93"&gt;Harold Black and the Negative-Feedback Amplifier, Ronald Kline, IEEE Control Systems, Aug 1993, Volume 13, Issue 4, Pages 82-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite journal | last =Bennett | first =Stuart | author-link = | title =A brief history of automatic control | journal =IEEE Control Systems Magazine | volume =16 | issue =3 | pages =17–25 | publisher = | location = | date =June 1996 | language = | url =http://ieeecss.org/CSM/library/1996/june1996/02-HistoryofAutoCtrl.pdf | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.1109/37.506394| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = 18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the speed of the car starts to drop below the goal-speed, for example when climbing a hill, the small increase in the error signal, amplified, causes engine output to increase, which keeps the error very nearly at zero. If the speed begins to exceed the goal, e.g. when going down a hill, the engine is throttled back so as to act as a brake, so again the speed is kept from departing more than a barely detectable amount from the goal speed (brakes being needed only if the hill is too steep). The result is that the cruise control system maintains a speed close to the goal as the car goes up and down hills, and as other disturbances such as wind affect the car's speed. This is all done without any planning of specific actions, and without any blind reactions to stimuli. Indeed, the cruise control system does not sense disturbances such as wind pressure at all, it only senses the controlled variable, speed. Nor does it control the power generated by the engine, it uses the 'behavior' of engine power as its means to control the sensed speed.

The same principles of negative feedback control (including the ability to nullify effects of unpredictable external or internal disturbances) apply to living control systems.&lt;ref name=Wiener48/&gt; The thesis of PCT is that animals and people do not control their behavior; rather, they vary their behavior as their means for controlling their perceptions, with or without external disturbances. This directly contradicts the historical and still widespread assumption that behavior is the final result of stimulus inputs and cognitive plans.&lt;ref name=Marken2009rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Miller| first =George |author2=Galanter, Eugene |author3=Pribram, Karl| title =Plans and the structure of behavior| publisher =[[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]| year =1960| location =[[New York City|New York]]| isbn=0-03-010075-5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The methodology of modeling, and PCT as model==

The principal datum in PCT methodology is the controlled variable. The fundamental step of PCT research, the test for controlled variables, begins with the slow and gentle application of disturbing influences to the state of a variable in the environment which the researcher surmises is already under control by the observed organism. It is essential not to overwhelm the organism's ability to control, since that is what is being investigated. If the organism changes its actions just so as to prevent the disturbing influence from having the expected effect on that variable, that is strong evidence that the experimental action disturbed a controlled variable. It is crucially important to distinguish the perceptions and point of view of the observer from those of the observed organism. It may take a number of variations of the test to isolate just which aspect of the environmental situation is under control, as perceived by the observed organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Runkel | first =Philip J. | author-link = | title =People as living things | publisher =Living Control Systems Publishing | edition = | date =2003 | location =Hayward, CA | pages =77–79  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-9740155-0-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marken.center.fielder&gt;{{cite journal | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | author-link = | title =Controlled variables: psychology as the center fielder views it | journal =American Journal of Psychology | volume =114 | issue =2 | pages =259–281 | publisher =University of Illinois Press | location = | date =2001 | language = | url = | jstor =1423517 | issn = | doi =10.2307/1423517 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCT employs a [[black box]] methodology. The controlled variable as measured by the observer corresponds quantitatively to a reference value for a perception that the organism is controlling. The controlled variable is thus an objective index of the purpose or intention of those particular behavioral actions by the organism&amp;mdash;the goal which those actions consistently work to attain despite disturbances. With few exceptions, in the current state of [[neuroscience]] this internally maintained reference value is seldom directly observed as such (e.g. as a rate of firing in a neuron), since few researchers trace the relevant electrical and chemical variables by their specific pathways while a living organism is engaging in what we externally observe as behavior.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. works [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2EgcIyIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en listed here].&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a working negative feedback system simulated on a digital computer performs essentially identically to observed organisms, then the well understood negative feedback structure of the simulation or model (the white box) is understood to demonstrate the unseen negative feedback structure within the organism (the black box).&lt;ref name=Runkel.cast/&gt;

Data for individuals are not aggregated for statistical analysis;&lt;ref&gt;See Runkel 1990 on the limitations of statistical methods and the value of individual performance data.&lt;/ref&gt; instead, a generative model is built which replicates the data observed for individuals with very high fidelity (0.95 or better). To build such a model of a given behavioral situation requires careful measurements of three observed variables:

{|
|- valign="top"
| ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' || The input quantity, that aspect of the stimulus which the subject perceives and has been demonstrated to be controlling.
|- valign="top"
| ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' || The output quantity, that aspect of the subject's behavior which affects the state of ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.
|- valign="top"
| ''d'' || The disturbance, a value summing the effects that any other influences in the environment have on the state of ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. In a controlled experiment one aims to have just one disturbing influence that is under the control of the investigator, but in naturalistic observation the situation is frequently more complex.
|}

A fourth value, the internally maintained reference ''r'' (a variable ′setpoint′), is deduced from the value at which the organism is observed to maintain ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', as determined by the test for controlled variables (described at the beginning of this section).

With two variables specified, the controlled input ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the reference ''r'', a properly designed control system, simulated on a digital computer, produces outputs ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' that almost precisely oppose unpredictable disturbances ''d'' to the controlled input. Further, the variance from perfect control accords well with that observed for living organisms.&lt;ref name=Powers2008&gt;{{cite book | last =Powers | first =William T. | title =Living Control Systems III: The fact of control | publisher =Benchmark Publications | date =2008 | location =New Canaan, CT | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-9647121-8-8 }} [Mathematical appendix by Dr. Richard Kennaway. Includes computer programs for the reader to demonstrate and experimentally test the theory.]&lt;/ref&gt; Perfect control would result in zero effect of the disturbance, but living organisms are not perfect controllers, and the aim of PCT is to model living organisms. When a computer simulation performs with &gt;95% conformity to experimentally measured values, opposing the effect of unpredictable changes in ''d'' by generating (nearly) equal and opposite values of ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'', it is understood to model the behavior and the internal control-loop structure of the organism.&lt;ref name=Runkel-PLT/&gt;&lt;ref name=PCM1960/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powers73/&gt;

By extension, the elaboration of the theory constitutes a general model of cognitive process and behavior. With every specific model or simulation of behavior that is constructed and tested against observed data, the general model that is presented in the theory is exposed to potential challenge that could call for revision or could lead to refutation.

==Mathematics==

To illustrate the mathematical calculations employed in a PCT simulation, consider a pursuit tracking task in which the participant keeps a mouse cursor aligned with a moving target on a computer monitor.

The model assumes that a perceptual signal within the participant represents the magnitude of the input quantity ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. (This has been demonstrated to be a rate of firing in a neuron, at least at the lowest levels.)&lt;ref name=Powers73&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Behavior: The Control of Perception]]| year=1973| first=William T.| last=Powers| isbn=0-7045-0092-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yin.BG2014&gt;{{cite journal | last =Yin | first =Henry H. | author-link = | title =How Basal Ganglia Outputs Generate Behavior | journal =Advances in Neuroscience | volume =2014 | issue =768313 | pages =28 | publisher =Hindawi Publishing Corporation | location = | date =18 November 2014  | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi =10.1155/2014/768313 | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tracking task, the input quantity is the vertical distance between the target position ''T'' and the cursor position ''C'', and the random variation of the target position acts as the disturbance ''d'' of that input quantity. This suggests that the perceptual signal ''p'' quantitatively represents the cursor position ''C'' minus the target position T, as expressed in the equation ''p''=''C''&amp;ndash;''T''.

Between the perception of target and cursor and the construction of the signal representing the distance between them there is a delay of ''&amp;Tau;'' milliseconds, so that the working perceptual signal at time ''t'' represents the target-to-cursor distance at a prior time, ''t'' &amp;ndash; ''&amp;Tau;''. Consequently, the equation used in the model is

1. ''p''(''t'') = ''C''(''t&amp;ndash;&amp;Tau;'') &amp;ndash; ''T''(''t&amp;ndash;&amp;Tau;'')

The negative feedback control system receives a reference signal ''r'' which specifies the magnitude of the given perceptual signal which is currently intended or desired. (For the origin of ''r'' within the organism, see under "[[#A hierarchy of control|A hierarchy of control]]", below.) Both ''r'' and ''p'' are input to a simple neural structure with ''r'' excitatory and ''p'' inhibitory. This structure is called a "comparator".&lt;ref name=Powers73/&gt; The effect is to subtract ''p'' from ''r'', yielding an error signal ''e'' that indicates the magnitude and sign of the difference between the desired magnitude ''r'' and the currently input magnitude ''p'' of the given perception. The equation representing this in the model is:

2. ''e'' = ''r&amp;ndash;p''

The error signal ''e'' must be transformed to the output quantity ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' (representing the participant's muscular efforts affecting the mouse position). Experiments have shown that in the best model for the output function, the mouse velocity ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'' is proportional to the error signal ''e'' by a gain factor ''G'' (that is, ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''G''*''e''). Thus, when the perceptual signal ''p'' is smaller than the reference signal ''r'', the error signal ''e'' has a positive sign, and from it the model computes an upward velocity of the cursor that is proportional to the error.

The next position of the cursor ''C&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the current position ''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus the velocity ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'' times the duration ''dt'' of one iteration of the program. By simple algebra, we substitute ''G''*''e'' (as given above) for ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'', yielding a third equation:

3. ''C&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''G''*''e''*''dt''

These three simple equations or program steps constitute the simplest form of the model for the tracking task. When these three simultaneous equations are evaluated over and over with the same random disturbances ''d'' of the target position that the human participant experienced, the output positions and velocities of the cursor duplicate the participant's actions in the tracking task above within 4.0% of their peak-to-peak range, in great detail.

This simple model can be refined with a damping factor ''d'' which reduces the discrepancy between the model and the human participant to 3.6% when the disturbance ''d'' is set to maximum difficulty.

3'. ''C&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' + [(''G''*''e'')&amp;ndash;(''d''*''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'')]*''dt''

Detailed discussion of this model in (Powers 2008)&lt;ref name=Powers2008/&gt; includes both source and executable code, with which the reader can verify how well this simple program simulates real behavior. No consideration is needed of possible nonlinearities such as the [[Weber-Fechner Law|Weber-Fechner law]], potential noise in the system, continuously varying angles at the joints, and many other factors that could afflict performance if this were a simple linear model. No [[inverse kinematics]] or predictive calculations are required. The model simply reduces the discrepancy between input ''p'' and reference ''r'' continuously as it arises in real time, and that is all that is required&amp;mdash;as predicted by the theory.&lt;ref name=Runkel-PLT/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powers73" /&gt;

==PCT as a solution to GOFAI complexity==

[Symbolic_artificial_intelligence|Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI)] is an early (1960s) approach to building intelligent systems. GOFAI assumes that AI programs are more complex versions of existing software designs, and that they can be built by extending existing procedural approaches and standard software methodologies. Objections to GOFAI can be separated into those based on program semantics, and those based on algorithmic complexity.

Implicit in the  theoretical approach  to GOFAI is the belief that minds (animal and human) are essentially syntactic, that is, made from symbols combined into expressions, a stance known as the [[Physical symbol system|Physical Symbol Systems Hypothesis]]. In recent years, this belief has been challenged by those who believe that minds are essentially semantic, i.e. they process embodied and situated meaning, not abstract data symbols. The 'poster child' of this oppositional stance is a thought experiment (Gedankenexperiment) called [[Chinese Room|Searle's Chinese Room (SCR)]], named after its inventor, philosopher [[John Searle]]. PCT is inherently situated, embodied, and dynamic.

Practical attempts  to building GOFAI soon run into asymptotic increases in algorithmic complexity, so-called 'complexity explosions'. They arise from the control paradigm assumed by GOFAI practitioners, which views governance (= feedforward command + feedback control) as modeling. In other words, for a GOFAI system to 'reason' about the world, it must first build an internal symbolic model of that world upon which it can apply sequences of symbolic manipulations in accord with the principles of [[Turing machine|Turing]] and [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] abstract machines. Even small changes in the world must be updated by the GOFAI program, in case they might be critical to its logical output. But any world model which contains sufficient detail to ensure correct GOFAI output is inevitably too complex, with too many moving parts to be practical, so that by the time world changes are updated, the world has already moved on.

PCT avoids the complexity issues of GOFAI by basing its real-time governance on a perceptual window (dimensionally reduced projection) of the world, which is much more tractable than the entire world. [[Jakob von Uexküll|Uexküll]],{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, Dyer,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} and Powers arrived independently at this insight, which is important for robotics.

==Distinctions from engineering control theory==

In the artificial systems that are specified by [[Control theory|engineering control theory]], the reference signal is considered to be an external input to the 'plant'.&lt;ref name=Astrom/&gt; In engineering control theory, the reference signal or set point is public; in PCT, it is not, but rather must be deduced from the results of the test for controlled variables, as described above in the [[#The methodology of modeling, and PCT as model|methodology section]]. This is because in living systems a reference signal is not an externally accessible input, but instead originates within the system. In the hierarchical model, error output of higher-level control loops, as described in the [[#A hierarchy of control|next section below]], evokes the reference signal ''r'' from synapse-local memory, and the strength of ''r'' is proportional to the (weighted) strength of the error signal or signals from one or more higher-level systems.&lt;ref name=levels&gt;{{Citation | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | first2 =Powers | last2 =William T. | contribution =Levels of intention in behavior | year =1989 | title =Volitional Action | editor-last =Hershberger | editor-first =Wayne | pages =409–430 | place =Amsterdam | publisher =Elsevier B.V. | series =Advances in psychology | volume =62 | isbn =978-0-444-88318-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In engineering control systems, in the case where there are several such reference inputs, a 'Controller' is designed to manipulate those inputs so as to obtain the effect on the output of the system that is desired by the system's designer, and the task of a control theory (so conceived) is to calculate those manipulations so as to avoid instability and oscillation. The designer of a PCT model or simulation specifies no particular desired effect on the output of the system, except that it must be whatever is required to bring the input from the environment (the perceptual signal) into conformity with the reference. In Perceptual Control Theory, the input function for the reference signal is a weighted sum of internally generated signals (in the canonical case, higher-level error signals), and loop stability is determined locally for each loop in the manner sketched in the preceding section on the [[#Mathematics of PCT|mathematics of PCT]] (and elaborated more fully in the [[#References|referenced literature]]). The weighted sum is understood to result from [[#Reorganization in evolution, development, and learning|reorganization]].

Engineering control theory is computationally demanding, but as the [[#Mathematics of PCT|preceding section]] shows, PCT is not. For example, contrast the implementation of a model of an [[inverted pendulum]] in engineering control theory&lt;ref&gt;Documented e.g. at [http://csuchico-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.4/145/4%2022%2009%20Jose%20Miranda.pdf?sequence=1 Miranda, José Luis Corona. 2009.

This is one of many computer demonstrations that are available, with source code, at [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/demos/tutor_pct.html www.livingcontrolsystems.com/demos/tutor_pct.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==A hierarchy of control==

Perceptions, in PCT, are constructed and controlled in a hierarchy of levels. For example, visual perception of an object is constructed from differences in light intensity or differences in sensations such as color at its edges. Controlling the shape or location of the object requires altering the perceptions of sensations or intensities (which are controlled by lower-level systems). This organizing principle is applied at all levels, up to the most abstract philosophical and theoretical constructs.

The Russian physiologist Nicolas Bernstein&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Nicolas. 1967. ''Coordination and regulation of movements''. New York: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; independently came to the same conclusion that behavior has to be multiordinal—organized hierarchically, in layers. A simple problem led to this conclusion at about the same time both in PCT and in Bernstein's work. The spinal reflexes act to stabilize limbs against disturbances. Why do they not prevent centers higher in the brain from using those limbs to carry out behavior? Since the brain obviously does use the spinal systems in producing behavior, there must be a principle that allows the higher systems to operate by incorporating the reflexes, not just by overcoming them or turning them off. The answer is that the reference value (setpoint) for a spinal reflex is not static; rather, it is varied by higher-level systems as their means of moving the limbs. This principle applies to higher feedback loops, as each loop presents the same problem to subsystems above it.

Whereas an engineered control system has a reference value or [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] adjusted by some external agency, the reference value for a biological control system cannot be set in this way. The setpoint must come from some internal process. If there is a way for behavior to affect it, any perception may be brought to the state momentarily specified by higher levels and then be maintained in that state against unpredictable disturbances. In a hierarchy of control systems, higher levels adjust the goals of lower levels as their means of approaching their own goals set by still-higher systems. This has important consequences for any proposed external control of an autonomous living control system (organism). At the highest level, reference values (goals) are set by heredity or adaptive processes.

==Reorganization in evolution, development, and learning==

If an organism controls inappropriate perceptions, or if it controls some perceptions to inappropriate values, then it is less likely to bring progeny to maturity, and may die. Consequently, by [[natural selection]] successive generations of organisms evolve so that they control those perceptions that, when controlled with appropriate setpoints, tend to maintain critical internal variables at optimal levels, or at least within non-lethal limits. Powers called these critical internal variables "intrinsic variables" (Ashby's "essential variables").

The mechanism that influences the development of structures of perceptions to be controlled is termed "reorganization", a process within the individual organism that is subject to natural selection just as is the evolved structure of individuals within a species.&lt;ref name="Byte"&gt;For an introduction, see the ''Byte'' articles on robotics and the article on the origins of purpose in this [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/intro_papers/bill_pct.html collection].&lt;/ref&gt;

This "reorganization system" is proposed to be part of the inherited structure of the organism. It changes the underlying parameters and connectivity of the control hierarchy in a random-walk manner. There is a basic continuous rate of change in intrinsic variables which proceeds at a speed set by the total error (and stops at zero error), punctuated by random changes in direction in a hyperspace with as many dimensions as there are critical variables. This is a more or less direct adaptation of Ashby's "[[homeostat]]", first adopted into PCT in the 1960 paper&lt;ref name=PCM1960 /&gt; and then changed to use E. coli's method of navigating up gradients of nutrients, as described by Koshland (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Koshland, Daniel. (1980). ''Bacterial chemotaxis as a model behavioral system''. New York: Raven Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reorganization may occur at any level when loss of control at that level causes intrinsic (essential) variables to deviate from genetically determined set points. This is the basic mechanism that is involved in trial-and-error learning, which leads to the acquisition of more systematic kinds of learning processes.&lt;ref name="Cziko 1995"&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Without Miracles]]| year=1995| first=Gary| last=Cziko| isbn=0-262-03232-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict==

In a hierarchy of interacting control systems, different systems at one level can send conflicting goals to one lower system. When two systems are specifying different goals for the same lower-level variable, they are in [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]]. Protracted conflict is experienced by human beings as many forms of psychological distress such as anxiety, obsession, depression, confusion, and vacillation. Severe conflict prevents the affected systems from being able to control, effectively destroying their function for the organism.

Higher level control systems often are able to use known strategies (which are themselves acquired through prior reorganizations) to seek perceptions that don't produce the conflict. Normally, this takes place without notice. If the conflict persists and systematic "problem solving" by higher systems fails, the reorganization system may modify existing systems until they bypass the conflict or until they produce new reference signals (goals) that are not in conflict at lower levels.

When reorganization results in an arrangement that reduces or eliminates the error that is driving it, the process of reorganization slows or stops with the new organization in place. (This replaces the concept of reinforcement learning.) New means of controlling the perceptions involved, and indeed new perceptual constructs subject to control, may also result from reorganization. In simplest terms, the reorganization process varies things until something works, at which point we say that the organism has learned. When simulations of this method are done in the right way, they demonstrate that this method is surprisingly efficient.

==Psychotherapy: the method of levels (MOL)==
{{Main|Method of levels}}

The reorganization concept has led to a method of psychotherapy called the [[method of levels]] (MOL). Using MOL, the therapist aims to help the patient shift his or her awareness to higher levels of perception in order to resolve conflicts and allow reorganization to take place.&lt;ref name=Mansell.Carey.2012&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mansell |first1=Warren |last2=Carey |first2=Timothy A |last3=Tai |first3=Sara |title=A transdiagnostic approach to CBT using method of levels therapy: distinctive features |year=2012 |series=The CBT distinctive features series |location=Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780415507639 |oclc=774499959 |doi=10.4324/9780203081334 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==

===Learning===

Currently, no one theory has been agreed upon to explain the synaptic, neuronal or systemic basis of learning. Prominent since 1973, however, is the idea that [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) of populations of [[synapse]]s induces learning through both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms (Bliss &amp; Lømo, 1973; Bliss &amp; Gardner-Medwin, 1973). LTP is a form of [[Hebbian learning]], which proposed that high-frequency, tonic activation of a circuit of neurones increases the efficacy with which they are activated and the size of their response to a given stimulus as compared to the standard neurone (Hebb, 1949).&lt;ref name=Hebb49&gt;{{cite book | last =Hebb | first =Donald | title =The organization of behavior: A neuropsychological theory | publisher =Wiley &amp; Sons | date =1949 | location =New York | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms are the principles behind Hebb's famously simple explanation: "Those that fire together, wire together" (Hebb, 1949).

LTP has received much support since it was first observed by [[Terje Lømo]] in 1966 and is still the subject of many modern studies and clinical research. However, there are possible alternative mechanisms underlying LTP, as presented by Enoki, Hu, Hamilton and Fine in 2009, published in the journal ''[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]''. They concede that LTP is the basis of learning. However, they firstly propose that LTP occurs in individual synapses, and this plasticity is graded (as opposed to in a binary mode) and bidirectional (Enoki et al., 2009). Secondly, the group suggest that the synaptic changes are expressed solely presynaptically, via changes in the probability of transmitter release (Enoki et al., 2009). Finally, the team predict that the occurrence of LTP could be age-dependent, as the plasticity of a neonatal brain would be higher than that of a mature one. Therefore, the theories differ, as one proposes an on/off occurrence of LTP by pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms and the other proposes only presynaptic changes, graded ability, and age-dependence.

These theories do agree on one element of LTP, namely, that it must occur through physical changes to the synaptic membrane/s, i.e. synaptic plasticity. Perceptual control theory encompasses both of these views. It proposes the mechanism of [[#Reorganization in evolution, development, and learning|'reorganisation']] as the basis of learning. Reorganisation occurs within the inherent control system of a human or animal by restructuring the inter- and intraconnections of its hierarchical organisation, akin to the neuroscientific phenomenon of neural plasticity. This reorganisation initially allows the trial-and-error form of learning, which is seen in babies, and then progresses to more structured learning through association, apparent in infants, and finally to systematic learning, covering the adult ability to learn from both internally and externally  generated stimuli and events. In this way, PCT provides a valid model for learning that combines the biological mechanisms of LTP with an explanation of the progression and change of mechanisms associated with developmental ability (Plooij 1984,&lt;ref name=Plooij1984&gt;{{cite book | last =Plooij | first =Frans X. | title =The behavioral development of free-living chimpanzee babies and infants. | publisher =Ablex | date =1984 | location =Norwood, N.J. | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1987,&lt;ref name=Plooij-Plooij1987&gt;{{cite journal | last =van de Rijt-Plooij | first =Hetty | last2 =Plooij | first2 =Frans | author-link = | title =Growing independence, conflict and learning in mother-infant relations in free-ranging chimpanzees | journal =Behaviour | volume =101 | issue = | pages =1–86 | publisher = | location = | date =1987 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.1163/156853987x00378| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2003,&lt;ref name=Plooij2003&gt;{{Citation | last =Plooij | first =Frans X. | contribution = | year =2003 | title =The trilogy of mind | editor-last =Heimann | editor-first =M. | volume =Regression periods in human infancy | pages =185–205 | place =Mahwah, New Jersey | publisher =Erlbaum | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plooij &amp; Plooij (1990),&lt;ref name=Plooij-Plooij1990&gt;{{cite journal | last =Plooij | first =Frans X. | last2 =van de Rijt-Plooij | first2 =Hetty | title =Developmental transitions as successive reorganizations of a control hierarchy | journal =American Behavioral Scientist | volume =34 | issue = | pages =67–80 | publisher = | location = | date =1990 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.1177/0002764290034001007| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013&lt;ref name="Plooij-Plooij2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=[[The Wonder Weeks]]: How to Stimulate Your Baby's Mental Development and Help Him Turn His 10 Predictable, Great, Fussy Phases into Magical Leaps Forward|last=van de Rijt-Plooij|first=Hetty|last2=Plooij|first2=Frans|date=October 22, 2013|publisher=Kiddy World Publishing|year=|isbn=9491882007|location=Arnhem, Netherlands|pages=480|language=|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Powers (2008) produced a simulation of arm co-ordination.&lt;ref name=Powers2008/&gt; He suggested that in order to move your arm, fourteen control systems that control fourteen joint angles are involved, and they reorganise simultaneously and independently. It was found that for optimum performance, the output functions must be organised in a way so as each control system's output only affects the one environmental variable it is perceiving. In this simulation, the reorganising process is working as it should, and just as Powers suggests that it works in humans, reducing outputs that cause error and increasing those that reduce error. Initially, the disturbances have large effects on the angles of the joints, but over time the joint angles match the reference signals more closely due to the system being reorganised. Powers (2008) suggests that in order to achieve coordination of joint angles to produce desired movements, instead of calculating how multiple joint angles must change to produce this movement the brain uses negative feedback systems to generate the joint angles that are required. A single reference signal that is varied in a higher-order system can generate a movement that requires several joint angles to change at the same time.&lt;ref name=Powers2008/&gt;

===Hierarchical organisation===

Botvinick (2008) proposed that one of the founding insights of the cognitive revolution was the recognition of hierarchical structure in human behavior. Despite decades of research, however, the computational mechanisms underlying hierarchically organized behavior are still not fully understood. Bedre, Hoffman, Cooney &amp; D'Esposito (2009) propose that the fundamental goal in cognitive neuroscience is to characterize the functional organization of the frontal cortex that supports the control of action.

Recent neuroimaging data has supported the hypothesis that the frontal lobes are organized hierarchically, such that control is supported in progressively caudal regions as control moves to more concrete specification of action. However, it is still not clear whether lower-order control processors are differentially affected by impairments in higher-order control when between-level interactions are required to complete a task, or whether there are feedback influences of lower-level on higher-level control (Bedre, Hoffman, Cooney &amp; D'Esposito 2009).

Botvinik (2008) found that all existing models of hierarchically structured behavior share at least one general assumption – that the hierarchical, part–whole organization of human action is mirrored in the internal or neural representations underlying it. Specifically, the assumption is that there exist representations not only of low-level motor behaviors, but also separable representations of higher-level behavioral units. The latest crop of models provides new insights, but also poses new or refined questions for empirical research, including how abstract action representations emerge through learning, how they interact with different modes of action control, and how they sort out within the prefrontal cortex (PFC).

Perceptual control theory (PCT) can provide an explanatory model of neural organisation that deals with the current issues. PCT describes the hierarchical character of behavior as being determined by control of hierarchically organized perception. Control systems in the body and in the internal environment of billions of interconnected neurons within the brain are responsible for keeping perceptual signals within survivable limits in the unpredictably variable environment from which those perceptions are derived. PCT does not propose that there is an internal model within which the brain simulates behavior before issuing commands to execute that behavior. Instead, one of its characteristic features is the principled lack of cerebral organisation of behavior. Rather, behavior is the organism's variable means to reduce the discrepancy between perceptions and reference values which are based on various external and internal inputs (Cools, 1985). Behavior must constantly adapt and change for an organism to maintain its perceptual goals. In this way, PCT can provide an explanation of abstract learning through spontaneous reorganisation of the hierarchy. PCT proposes that conflict occurs between disparate reference values for a given perception rather than between different responses (Mansell 2011), and that learning is implemented as trial-and-error changes of the properties of control systems (Marken &amp; Powers 1989),&lt;ref name=levels/&gt; rather than any specific response being ''reinforced''. In this way, behavior remains adaptive to the environment as it unfolds, rather than relying on learned action patterns that may not fit.

Hierarchies of perceptual control have been simulated in computer models and have been shown to provide a close match to behavioral data. For example, Marken&lt;ref name=Marken86&gt;{{cite journal | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | author-link = | title =Perceptual organization of behavior: A hierarchical control model of coordinated action. | journal =Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume =12 | issue =3 | pages =267–276 | publisher = | location = | date =Aug 1986 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi =10.1037/0096-1523.12.3.267 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an experiment comparing the behavior of a perceptual control hierarchy computer model with that of six healthy volunteers in three experiments. The participants were required to keep the distance between a left line and a centre line equal to that of the centre line and a right line. They were also instructed to keep both distances equal to 2&amp;nbsp;cm. They had 2 paddles in their hands, one controlling the left line and one controlling the middle line. To do this, they had to resist random disturbances applied to the positions of the lines. As the participants achieved control, they managed to nullify the expected effect of the disturbances by moving their paddles. The correlation between the behavior of subjects and the model in all the experiments approached .99. It is proposed that the organization of models of hierarchical control systems such as this informs us about the organization of the human subjects whose behavior it so closely reproduces.

==Robotics==

PCT has significant implications for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. The architecture, of a hierarchy of perceptual controllers, is an ideal and comparatively simple implementation for artificial systems by avoiding the need to generate specific actions whether by complex models of the external world or the computation from input-output mappings. 
This is in stark contrast to traditional methodologies, such as the computational approach and Behavior-based Robotics.

The application of perceptual control to Robotics was outlined in a seminal paper &lt;ref name=Young2017&gt;{{cite journal | last =Young| first =Rupert | author-link = | title =A General Architecture for Robotics Systems: A Perception-Based Approach to Artificial Life. | journal =Artificial Life| volume =23 | issue =2 | pages =236–286 | date =Jun 2017 | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Artificial Life journal by Rupert Young of Perceptual Robots in 2017.  The architecture has been applied to a number of real-world robotic systems including robotic rovers,&lt;ref&gt;

Traditional approaches to robotics, which generally depend upon the computation of actions in specific situations, result in inflexible, clumsy robots unable to cope with the dynamic nature of the world. PCT robots, on the other hand, demonstrate robots that inherently resist and counter the chaotic, unpredictable world.

==Current situation and prospects==

The preceding explanation of PCT principles provides justification of how this theory can provide a valid explanation of neural organisation and how it can explain some of the current issues of conceptual models.

Perceptual control theory currently proposes a hierarchy of 11 levels of perceptions controlled by systems in the human mind and neural architecture. These are: intensity, sensation, configuration, transition, event, relationship, category, sequence, program, principle, and system concept. Diverse perceptual signals at a lower level (e.g. visual perceptions of intensities) are combined in an input function to construct a single perception at the higher level (e.g. visual perception of a color sensation). The perceptions that are constructed and controlled at the lower levels are passed along as the perceptual inputs at the higher levels. The higher levels in turn control by adjusting the reference levels (goals) of the lower levels, in effect telling the lower levels what to perceive.&lt;ref name=Powers73/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cziko 1995"/&gt;

While many computer demonstrations of principles have been developed, the proposed higher levels are difficult to model because too little is known about how the brain works at these levels. Isolated higher-level control processes can be investigated, but models of an extensive hierarchy of control are still only conceptual, or at best rudimentary.

Perceptual control theory has not been widely accepted in mainstream psychology, but has been effectively used in a considerable range of domains&lt;ref&gt;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-28/november-2015/perceptual-control-revolution&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/06/book-review-behavior-the-control-of-perception/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IJHCS"&gt;The June 1999 Issue of ''The International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'' contained papers ranging from tracking through cockpit layout to self-image and crowd dynamics.&lt;/ref&gt; in human factors,&lt;ref name="CBUT"&gt;PCT lies at the foundation of [[Component-Based Usability Testing]].&lt;/ref&gt; clinical psychology, and psychotherapy (the "[[Method of Levels]]"), it is the basis for a considerable body of research in sociology,&lt;ref&gt;For example: McClelland, Kent A. and Thomas J.

In the [[mathematical]] subfields [[Complex analysis|function theory]] and [[numerical analysis]], a univariate polynomial [[Spline (mathematics)|spline]] of order &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''perfect spline''' if its &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-th derivative is equal to &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; between knots and changes its sign at every knot.

The term was coined by [[Isaac Jacob Schoenberg]].

Perfect splines often give solutions to various [[extremal problem]]s in mathematics. For example, [[norm (mathematics)|norms]] of periodic perfect splines (they are sometimes called [[Euler spline|Euler perfect splines]]) are equal to [[Favard constant|Favard's constants]].

In [[mathematics]], the '''principal part''' has several independent meanings, but usually refers to the negative-power portion of the [[Laurent series]] of a function.

==Laurent series definition==
The '''principal part''' at &lt;math&gt;z=a&lt;/math&gt; of a function
: &lt;math&gt;f(z) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty a_k (z-a)^k&lt;/math&gt;
is the portion of the [[Laurent series]] consisting of terms with negative degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=_cADk52kr4oC&amp;pg=PT48&amp;lpg=PT48&amp;dq=%22is+the+portion+of+the+Laurent+series+consisting+of+terms+with+negative+degree.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RKlSiQ7NgW&amp;sig=AF-n7iZnDphR5GchlSVlPpHVBMo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir7bG99ejLAhXGi5QKHZ1WCfkQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22is%20the%20portion%20of%20the%20Laurent%20series%20consisting%20of%20terms%20with%20negative%20degree.%22&amp;f=false | title=Laurent | accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is,
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_{-k} (z-a)^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;
is the principal part of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;.
If the Laurent series has an inner radius of convergence of 0 , then &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; has an [[essential singularity]] at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if the principal part is an infinite sum. If the inner radius of convergence is not 0, then &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; may be regular at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; despite the Laurent series having an infinite principal part.

==Other definitions==

===Calculus===
Consider the difference between the function [[differential of a function|differential]] and the actual increment:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=f'(x)+\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta y=f'(x)\Delta x +\varepsilon \Delta x = dy+\varepsilon \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;
The differential ''dy'' is sometimes called the '''principal (linear) part''' of the function increment ''Δy''.

===Distribution theory===
The term '''principal part''' is also used for certain kinds of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] having a [[singular support]] at a single point.

The '''profit model''' is the linear, deterministic algebraic model used implicitly by most [[cost accounting|cost accountants]]. Starting with, profit equals sales minus costs, it provides a structure for modeling cost elements such as materials, losses, multi-products, learning, depreciation etc. It provides a mutable conceptual base for spreadsheet modelers. This enables them to run deterministic simulations or '[[What-if analysis|what if]]' modelling to see the impact of price, cost or quantity changes on profitability.

==Basic model==

: &lt;math&gt; \pi = pq - (F_n+wq) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where:

: {{pi}} is profit
: ''p'' is sales price
: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is fixed costs
: ''w'' is variable costs per unit sold
: ''q'' is quantity sold

For an expansion of the model see below.

== Background ==
The justification for wanting to express profit as an [[algebra]]ic model is given by [[Richard Mattessich|Mattessich]] in 1961:
:'To some operations analysts the mere translation of accounting models into mathematical :terminology, without a calculus for determining an optimum, might appear to be a rather :pedestrian task. We are convinced, however, that as long as accounting methods are acceptable :to the industry the mere change to a mathematical formulation will be advantageous for :several reasons: (1) it can be considered a prerequisite for applying electronic data :processing to certain accounting problems, (2) it articulates the structure of the accounting :models and illuminates accounting methods from a new point of view, revealing many facets so :far neglected or unobserved, (3) it enables a general and hence more scientific presentation :of many accounting methods, (4) it facilitates the exploration of new areas, thereby :accelerating the advancement of accounting, (5) it leads to more sophisticated methods and :might help to lay the foundations for close cooperation of accounting with other areas of :management science.'&lt;ref name=Matt&gt;Mattessich, R. (1961). 'Budgeting models and system simulation', The Accounting Review, 36(3), 384–397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the definitions in cost accounting are in an unclear narrative form, not readily associated with other definitions of accounting calculations. For example, preparing a comparison of fixed cost variances in stock under different stock valuation methods can be confusing. Another example is modelling labour variances with learning curve corrections and stock level changes. With the absence of a basic profit model in an algebraic form, confident development of such models is difficult.

The development of spreadsheets has led to a decentralisation of financial modelling. This has often resulted in model builders lacking training in model construction. Before any professional model is built it is usually considered wise to start by developing a mathematical model for analysis. The profit model provides a general framework plus some specific examples of how such an a priori profit model might be constructed.

The presentation of a profit model in an algebraic form is not new. Mattessich's model,&lt;ref name=Matt /&gt; while large, does not include many costing techniques such as learning curves and different stock valuation methods. Also, it was not presented in a form that most accountants were willing or able to read. This paper presents a more extended model analysing profit but it does not, unlike Mattessich, extend to the balance sheet model. Its form, of starting with the basic definition of profit and becoming more elaborate, may make it more accessible to accountants.

Most cost accounting textbooks &lt;ref&gt;Drury, C. (1988). Management and Cost Accounting, London: V.N.R&lt;/ref&gt; explain basic Cost Volume Profit modeling in an algebraic form, but then revert to an 'illustrative' &lt;ref&gt;Ijiri, Y. (1983). 'New dimensions in accounting education: computers and algorithms,' Issues In Accounting Research, 168–173.&lt;/ref&gt; approach. This 'illustrative' approach uses examples or narrative to explain management accounting procedures. This format, though useful when communicating with humans, can be difficult to translate into an algebraic form, suitable for computer model building. Mepham &lt;ref&gt;Mepham, M. (1980). Accounting Models, London: Pitmans&lt;/ref&gt; extended the algebraic, or deductive, approach to cost accounting to cover many more techniques. He develops his model to integrate with the optimizing models in operations research. The profit model comes out of Mephams work, extending it but only in a descriptive, linear form.

== Model extensions ==
The basic profit model is sales minus costs. Sales are made up of quantity sold multiplied by their price. Costs are usually divided between Fixed costs and variable costs.

Using:
* Sales revenue = ''pq'' = price × quantity sold
* Cost of sales = ''wq'' = unit cost × quantity sold
*Administration, selling, engineers, personnel etc. = ''Fn'' = fixed post-manufacturing overheads 
*Profit = ''π''

Thus the profit can be calculated from:

: &lt;math&gt; \pi = pq - (F_n + wq) \qquad\qquad (1) &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that ''w'' (average unit production cost) includes the fixed and variable costs.
The square brackets contain the cost of goods sold, ''wq'' not cost of good made ''wx'' where ''x'' = cost of good sold.

To show cost of good sold, the opening and closing finished goods stocks need to be included
The profit model would then be:

* Opening stock = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; ''w'' = opening stock quantity × unit cost
* Cost of stock = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''w'' = closing stock quantity × unit cost
* Cost of production = ''wx'' = unit production cost × quantity made:

: &lt;math&gt; \pi = pq - [F_n + wx + g_0 w - g_1 w] \qquad\qquad (2) &lt;/math&gt;

Presenting the profit calculation in this form immediately demands that some of the costs be more carefully defined.

=== Production costs ===
The unit production costs (''w'') can be separated into fixed and variable costs:

: &lt;math&gt; w = \frac{F_m + vx}{x} \qquad\qquad (3) &lt;/math&gt;
  
where

* ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; = manufacturing fixed costs;
* ''v'' = variable costs per unit; 
* ''x'' = production quantity.

The introduction of this separation of ''w'' allows for consideration of the behaviour of costs for different levels of production. A linear cost curve is assumed here, divided between the constant (''F'') and its slope (''v''). If the modeller has access to the details of non-linear cost curves then ''w'' will need to be defined by the appropriate function.

Replacing ''wx'' in (equation 2) and making ''F'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; \pi = pq - [F + vx + g0w - g1w] \qquad \qquad (4) &lt;/math&gt;

=== Variable-cost elements ===
Moving on to other extensions of the basic model, the cost elements such as direct materials, direct labour and variable overheads can be included. If a non-linear function is available and thought useful such functions can be substituted for the functions used here.

The material cost of sales = m * µ * q, where

m is the amount of material in one unit of finished goods.

µ  is the cost per unit of the raw material.

The labour cost of sales = ''l λ q'', where

* ''l''  is the amount of labour hours required to make one unit of finished goods 
* ''λ''  is the labour cost (rate) per hour.

The variable overhead cost of sales = ''nq'' where ''n'' is the variable overhead cost per unit.

This is not here subdivided between quantity per finished goods units and cost per unit.

Thus the variable cost v * q can now be elaborated into:

: π  = pq - [F+(mµ q + l λq + nq)] …………(equation 5)

If the production quantity is required the finished goods stock will need to be added.

In a simple case two materials can be accommodated in the model by simply adding another m * µ. In more realistic situations a matrix and a vector will be necessary (see later).

If material cost of purchases is to be used rather than material cost of production it will be necessary to adjust for material stocks. That is,

: mx = md&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + mb - md&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;………… (equation 6)

where 
* d = material stock quantity, 
* 0 = opening, 1 = closing,  
* b = quantity of material purchased
* m = the amount of material in one unit of finished goods
* x = quantity used in production

=== Depreciation ===
All depreciation rules can be stated as equations representing their curve over time. The reducing balance method provides one of the more interesting examples.

Using c = cost, t = time, L = life, s = scrap value, Fd = time based depreciation:

: Depr/yr = Fd = c (s/c)(t-L)/L * [L(s/c)1/L] …………… (equation 7)

This equation is better known as the rule: Depreciation per year = Last year's written down value multiplied by a constant %

The limits are 0 &lt; t &lt; L, and the scrap value has to be greater than zero. (For zero use 0.1).

Remembering that time-based depreciation is a fixed cost and usage-based depreciation can be a variable cost, depreciation can easily be added into the model (equation 5).

Thus, the profit model becomes:

: π = pq - [F + F&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; + (mµ + lλ + n + n&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;)q]..........	(equation 8)

where, nd = usage (as q) based depreciation and π = annual profit.

=== Stock valuation ===
In the above, the value of the unit finished goods cost ‘w' was left undefined. There are numerous alternatives to how stock (w) is valued but only two will be compared here.

The marginal versus absorption costing debate, includes the question of the valuation of stock (w).

Should w = v or as (3) w = (Fm  + v x)/x.

(i)	Under marginal costing:  w = v. Inserting in (4),

: π  = pq- [F + v x + g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  - g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]

Becomes

: π  = pq- [F + v x + g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  - g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; v]

This can be simplified by taking v out and noting, opening stock quantity + production - closing stock quantity = sales quantity (q) so,

: π = p q - [F + v q]………….. (equation 9)

Note, v q = variable cost of goods sold.

(ii) Using full (absorption) costing
Using (equation 3), where xp = planned production, x1 = period production
w = (Fm + v xp)/xp = Fm/xp + v.
This can be shown to result in:

: π = p q - [F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; + v q + F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/x&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; * (q-x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)]………..(equation 10)

Note the strange presence of 'x' in the model.
Notice also that the absorption model (equation 10) is the same as the marginal costing model (equation 9) except for the end part:
: F/x&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; * (q-x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

This part represents the fixed costs in stock. This is better seen by remem¬bering q — x= go—g1 so it could be written

:F/x&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; • (g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;—g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

The model form with 'q' and 'x' in place of' g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; allows profits to be calculated when only the sales and production figures are known.

A spreadsheet could be prepared for a company with increasing then decreasing levels of sales and constant production. It could have another column showing profit under increasing sales and constant production. Thus the effects of carrying fixed costs in stock can be simulated. Such modelling thus provides a very useful tool in the marginal versus full costing debate.

=== Modelling for losses ===
One way of modeling for losses is to use: 
 
*Fixed losses, (quantity) = δf, 
*Variable losses (%) = δv, 
*Material losses = mδ, 
*Production losses = pδ

The model, with all these losses together will look like,

: π = v q – [F + µ * mδf + {mµ(1 + mδv) + lλ+n) * (1+ pδ* (q +pδf)]........  (equation 11)

Note that labour and variable overhead losses could also have been included.

=== Multi-products ===
So far the model has assumed very few products and/or cost elements. As many firms are multi-product the model they use must be able to handle this problem. Whilst the mathematics here is straightforward the accounting problems introduced are enormous: the cost allocation problem being a good example. Other examples include calculation of break-even points, productivity measures and the optimisation of limited resources. Here only the mechanics of building a multi-dimension model will be outlined.

If a firm sells two products (a and b) then the profit model (equation 9),

: π = pq —(F +vq) becomes

: π = (pa *qa +pb *qb) - [F + va*qa + vb *qb]

All fixed costs have been combined in F

Therefore, for multiple products

: π = Σ(pq) - [F + Σ(vq)].... (equation 12)

Where Σ = the sum of. Which can be drafted as a vector or matrix in a spreadsheet

or

: π = Σpq - [F + Σ(Σmμ +Σlλ + Σn)q]..... (equation 13)

=== Variances ===
The profit model may represent actual data (c), planned data (p)or standard data (s) which is the actual sales quantities at the planned costs.

The actual data model will be (using equation 8):

: π = p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;*q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; - [F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + (mµ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + lλ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + n&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]

The planned data model will be (using equation 8):

: π = p&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;*q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - [F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + (mµ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + lλ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]

The standard data model will be (using equation 8):

: π = p&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;*q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; - [F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + (mµ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + lλ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]

Operating variances are obtained by subtracting the actual model from the standard model.

=== Learning Curve Model ===
It is possible to add non linear cost curves to the Profit model. For example, if with learning, the labour time per unit will decrease exponentially over time as more product is made, then the time per unit is:

: l = r * q&lt;sup&gt;−b&lt;/sup&gt;

where 
r = average time. 
b = learning rate.
q = quantity.

Inserting into equation 8

: π = pq - [F + (mµ + rq&lt;sup&gt;−b&lt;/sup&gt;λ + n)q]

This equation is best solved by trial and error, the [[Newton's method|Newton Raphson method]] or graphing. Like depreciation within the model, the adjustment for learning does provide a form of non-linear sub-modelling.

=== Percentage Change Model ===
Rather than the variable be absolute amounts, they might be percentage changes. This represents a major change in approach from the model above. The model is often used in the 'now that ... (say) the cost of labour has gone up by 10%' format. If a model can be developed that only uses such percentage changes then the cost of collecting absolute quantities will be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Eilon, S. (1984), ''The Art of Reckoning: analysis of performance criteria'', London: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The notation used below is of attaching a % sign to variables to indicate the change of that variable, for example, p% = 0.10 if the selling price is assumed to change by 10%,

Let x = q and C = contribution

Starting with the absolute form of the contribution model (equation (9) rearranged):

: π + F = C = (p — v)q.

The increase in the contribution which results from an increase in p, v and/or q can be calculated thus:

: C(l + C%) = [p(l+p%)- v(l + v%)]q(l+q%)

rearranging and using α = (p — v)/p,

: C% = ((l+q%)/α)[p%-(l - α)v%]+q%......	(equation 18)

This model might look messy but it is very powerful. It makes very few demands on data, especially if some of the variables do not change. It is possible to develop most of the models presented above in this percentage change format.

In [[mathematical logic]], a '''redundant proof''' is a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] that has a subset that is a shorter proof of the same result.  That is, a proof &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is considered redundant if there exists another proof &lt;math&gt;\psi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\kappa^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\kappa^{\prime}\subseteq\kappa&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\kappa^{\prime} \;\text{subsumes}\; \kappa&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;|\psi^{\prime}|&lt;|\psi|&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;|\varphi|&lt;/math&gt; is the number of nodes in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine, Pascal; Merz, Stephan; Woltzenlogel Paleo, Bruno. ''Compression of Propositional Resolution Proofs via Partial Regularization''. 23rd International Conference on Automated Deduction, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local redundancy ==

A proof containing a subproof of the shapes (here omitted pivots{{explain|date=December 2017}} indicate that the resolvents must be uniquely defined)

: &lt;math&gt; (\eta\odot\eta_1) \odot (\eta\odot\eta_2)\text{ or }   \eta \odot (\eta_1 \odot (\eta\odot\eta_2))&lt;/math&gt;

is locally redundant.

Indeed, both of these subproofs can be equivalently replaced by the shorter subproof &lt;math&gt;\eta \odot (\eta_1 \odot \eta_2 )&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of local redundancy, the pairs of redundant inferences having the same pivot occur close to each other in the proof. However, redundant inferences can also occur far apart in the proof.

The following definition generalizes local redundancy by considering inferences with the same pivot that occur within different contexts. We write &lt;math&gt;\psi\left[\eta\right]&lt;/math&gt; to denote a proof-context &lt;math&gt;\psi\left[-\right]&lt;/math&gt; with a single placeholder replaced by the subproof &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;.

== Global redundancy ==

A proof

: &lt;math&gt; \psi [ \psi_1 [\eta \odot_p \eta_1 ] \odot \psi_2 [\eta\odot_{p} \eta_{2}] ]\text{ or } \psi [ \psi_1 [ \eta\odot_p ( \eta_1 \odot \psi_2 [ \eta \odot_p \eta_2 ])]] &lt;/math&gt;

is potentially (globally) redundant. Furthermore, it is (globally) redundant if it can be rewritten to one of the following shorter proofs:

: &lt;math&gt; \psi [ \eta \odot_p ( \psi_1 [ \eta_1 ] \odot \psi_2 [ \eta_2 ] )]\text{ or } \eta \odot_p \psi [ \psi_1 [ \eta_1 ]\odot\psi_2[\eta_2]]\text { or } \psi [ \psi_1 [ \eta_1 ] \odot \psi_2 [ \eta_2 ] ].&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===
The proof

: &lt;math&gt;
\cfrac{\cfrac{\cfrac{\eta:\, p,q\,\,\,\,\eta_{1}:\,\neg p,r}{q,r}p\,\,\,\,\,\,\begin{array}{c}
\\\eta_{3}:\,\neg q\end{array}}{r}q\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\cfrac{\cfrac{\eta\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\eta_{2}:\,\neg p,s,\neg r}{q,s,\neg r}p\,\,\,\,\begin{array}{c}
\\\eta_{3}\end{array}}{s,\neg r}q}{\psi:\, s}r
&lt;/math&gt;

is locally redundant as it is an instance of the first pattern in the definition &lt;math&gt; ((\eta\odot_p \eta_1) \odot \eta_3) \odot ((\eta\odot_p \eta_2) \odot \eta_3).&lt;/math&gt;

* The pattern is &lt;math&gt; \psi [\psi_1 [\eta \odot_p \eta_1] \odot \psi_2 [ \eta \odot_p \eta_2 ]]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \psi_1 [-] = \psi_2 [-] =\_\odot\eta_3 \text{ and }\psi [-] = \_&lt;/math&gt;

But it is not globally redundant because the replacement terms according to the definition contain &lt;math&gt; \psi_1 [\eta_1] \odot \psi_2 [\eta_2]&lt;/math&gt; in all the cases and &lt;math&gt; \psi_1 [\eta_1] \odot \psi_2 [\eta_2] = (\eta_1 \odot \eta_3) \odot (\eta_2 \odot \eta_3)&lt;/math&gt; does not correspond to a proof. In particular, neither &lt;math&gt;\eta_1&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;\eta_2&lt;/math&gt; can be resolved with &lt;math&gt;\eta_3&lt;/math&gt;, as they do not contain the literal &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.

The second pattern of potentially globally redundant proofs appearing in global redundancy definition is related to the well-known{{explain|date=December 2017}} notion of regularity{{explain|date=December 2017}}. Informally, a proof is irregular if there is a path from a node to the root of the proof such that a literal is used more than once as a pivot in this path.

In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''rising sun lemma''' is a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] due to [[Frigyes Riesz]], used in the proof of the [[Hardy–Littlewood maximal theorem]].  The lemma was a precursor in one dimension of the [[Calderón–Zygmund lemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lemma is stated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Riesz|1932}}
*{{harvnb|Zygmund|1977|p=31}}
*{{harvnb|Tao|2011|pp=118–119}}
*{{harvnb|Duren|1970|loc=Appendix B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Suppose ''g'' is a real-valued continuous function on the interval [''a'',''b''] and ''S'' is the set of ''x'' in [''a'',''b''] such that ''g''(''x'') &lt; ''g''(''y'') for some ''y'' with ''x'' &lt; ''y'' ≤ ''b''. (Note that ''b'' is not in ''S'', though ''a'' may be.) Define ''E'' = ''S'' ∩ (''a'',''b'').

:Then ''E'' is an open set, and it may be written as a countable union of disjoint intervals 
::&lt;math&gt;E=\bigcup_k (a_k,b_k)&lt;/math&gt;
:such that ''g''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''g''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;), unless ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' ∈ ''S'' for some ''k'', in which case ''g''(''a'') &lt; ''g''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) for that one ''k''. Furthermore, if ''x'' ∈ (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;), then ''g''(''x'') &lt; ''g''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;).

The colorful name of the lemma comes from imagining the graph of the function ''g'' as a mountainous landscape, 
with the sun shining horizontally from the right. The set ''E'' consist of points that are in the shadow.

==Proof==
We need a lemma: Suppose [''c'',''d'') ⊂ ''S'', but d ∉ ''S''. Then ''g''(''c'') &lt; ''g''(''d'').
To prove this, suppose ''g''(''c'') ≥ ''g''(''d'').
Then ''g'' achieves its maximum on [''c'',''d''] at some point ''z'' &lt; ''d''.
Since ''z'' ∈ ''S'', there is a ''y'' in (''z'',''b''] with ''g''(''z'') &lt; ''g''(''y''). 
If ''y'' ≤ ''d'', then ''g'' would not reach its maximum on [''c'',''d''] at ''z''.
Thus, ''y'' ∈ (''d'',''b''], and ''g''(''d'') ≤ ''g''(''z'') &lt; ''g''(''y'').
This means that ''d'' ∈ ''S'', which is a contradiction, thus establishing the lemma.

The set ''E'' is open, so it is composed of a countable union of disjoint intervals (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;).

It follows immediately from the lemma that ''g''(''x'') &lt; ''g''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) for ''x'' in 
(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;).
Since ''g'' is continuous, we must also have ''g''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''g''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;). 

If ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ''a'' or ''a'' ∉ ''S'', then ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ∉ ''S'', 
so ''g''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ ''g''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;), for otherwise ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''S''. 
Thus, ''g''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''g''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) in these cases.

Finally, if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' ∈ ''S'', the lemma tells us that ''g''(''a'') &lt; ''g''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;).

In [[geometry]], a '''stellation diagram''' or '''stellation pattern''' is a two-dimensional diagram in the plane of some face of a [[polyhedron]], showing lines where other face planes intersect with this one. The lines cause 2D space to be divided up into regions. Regions not intersected by any further lines are called elementary regions. Usually infinite regions are excluded from the diagram, along with any infinite portions of the lines. Each elementary region represents a top face of one [[Cell (geometry)|cell]], and a bottom face of another.

A collection of these diagrams, one for each face type, can be used to represent any [[stellation]] of the polyhedron, by shading the regions which should appear in that stellation.

A stellation diagram exists for every face of a given polyhedron. In [[face transitive]] polyhedra, symmetry can be used to require all faces have the same diagram shading. Semiregular polyhedra like the [[Archimedean solid]]s will have different stellation diagrams for different kinds of faces.

      <comment>Disambiguated: [[three-dimensional graph]] → [[graph of a function of two variables]]</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2323">A '''tetraview''' is an attempt to [[Graph of a function|graph]] a [[complex function]] of a [[complex variable]], by a method invented by [[Davide P. Cervone]].

A graph of a [[real function]] of a [[Function of a real variable|real variable]] is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[ordered pair]]s (x,y) such that y = f(x).  This is the ordinary two-[[dimension]]al [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] graph studied in school [[algebra]].

Every [[complex number]] has both a [[real part]] and an [[imaginary part]], so one complex variable is two-dimensional and a pair of complex variables is four-dimensional.  A tetraview is an attempt to give a picture of a four-dimensional object using a two-dimensional representation—either on a piece of paper or on a computer screen, showing a still picture consisting of five views, one in the center and one at each corner.  This is roughly analogous to a picture of a three-dimensional object by giving a front view, a side view, and a view from above.

A picture of a three-dimensional object is a [[3D projection|projection]] of that object from three dimensions into two dimensions.  A tetraview is set of five projections, first from four dimensions into three dimensions, and then from three dimensions into two dimensions.

A complex function w = f(z), where z = a + b''i'' and w = c + d''i'' are complex numbers, has a graph in four-space (four dimensional space) R&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of all points (a, b, c, d) such that c + d''i'' = f(a + b''i'').

To construct a tetraview, we begin with the four points (1,0,0,0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 0, 1), which are vertices of a spherical [[tetrahedron]] on the unit [[three-sphere]] S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in R&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

We project the four-dimensional graph onto the three-dimensional sphere along one of the four [[coordinate axis|coordinate axes]], and then give a two-dimensional picture of the resulting [[graph of a function of two variables|three-dimensional graph]].  This provides the four corner graph.  The graph in the center is a similar picture "taken" from the point of view of the origin.

'''Thomae's function''', named after [[Carl Johannes Thomae]], has many names: the '''popcorn function''', the '''raindrop function''', the '''countable cloud function''', the '''modified Dirichlet function''', the '''ruler function''',&lt;ref&gt;"…the so-called ''ruler function'', a simple but provocative example that appeared in a work of Johannes Karl Thomae … The graph suggests the vertical markings on a ruler—hence the name." {{Harv|Dunham|2008|p=149|loc=chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Riemann function''', or the '''Stars over Babylon''' ([[John Horton Conway]]'s name).&lt;ref&gt;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=1375516&lt;/ref&gt; This [[real number|real]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''(''x'') of the real variable ''x'' is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beanland|Roberts|Stevenson|2009|p=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{q} &amp;\text{if }x=\tfrac{p}{q}\quad (x \text{ is rational), with }p \in \mathbb Z \text{ and } q \in \mathbb N \text{ coprime}\\
  0           &amp;\text{if }x\text{ is irrational.}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since every rational number has a unique representation with [[coprime numbers|relatively prime]] &lt;math&gt;p \in \mathbb Z\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q \in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;, the function is [[well-defined]]. Note that &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; is the only number in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt; which is coprime to &lt;math&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

It is a modification of the [[Dirichlet function]], which is 1 at rational numbers and 0 elsewhere.

==Properties==
*Thomae's function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''bounded''' and maps all real numbers to the unit interval:&lt;math&gt;\;f: \mathbb R\; \rightarrow \;[0,\; 1].&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''periodic''' with period &lt;math&gt;1:\; f(x + n) = f(x)\;&lt;/math&gt; for all integer {{mvar|n}} and all real {{mvar|x}}.
 
{{Collapse top|title=Proof of periodicity|width=80%}}
For all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb R \smallsetminus \mathbb Q\;:\quad f(x+n) = f(x)= 0,&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;(x+n) \in \mathbb R \smallsetminus \mathbb Q\; \Rightarrow x \in \mathbb R \smallsetminus \mathbb Q. &lt;/math&gt;

For all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb Q,\;&lt;/math&gt; there exist &lt;math&gt;p \in \mathbb Z\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\;q \in \mathbb N,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\;x = p/q,\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \gcd(p,\;q) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
According to [[Bézout's identity]], for some &lt;math&gt;a,\;b \in \mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; holds
:&lt;math&gt;\gcd\left( (p+nq),\;q\right) = ap + (an + b)q = \gcd(p,\;q) = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus &lt;math&gt;f(x + n)= f(\tfrac{p+nq}{q})=\tfrac{1}{q} = f(\tfrac{p}{q}) = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;
{{Collapse bottom}}

*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''discontinuous''' at all rational numbers, dense within the real numbers.

{{Collapse top|title=Proof of discontinuity at rational numbers|width=80%}}
Assume an arbitrary rational &lt;math&gt;x_0 = p/q,\;&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\;p \in \mathbb Z,\; q \in \mathbb N \;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\; (p,\; q)\,&lt;/math&gt; coprime.

This establishes &lt;math&gt;\quad f(x_0) = 1/q.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\;\alpha \in \mathbb R \smallsetminus \mathbb Q\;&lt;/math&gt; be any irrational number and define for all &lt;math&gt;\; i \in \mathbb N,\; &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\quad x_i = x_0 + \frac{\alpha}{i}.&lt;/math&gt;

These &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are all irrational, and so &lt;math&gt;\quad f(x_i) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This implies &lt;math&gt;\quad|x_0 - x_i| = \frac{\alpha}{i},\quad&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\quad |f(x_0) - f(x_i)| = \frac{1}{q}.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking &lt;math&gt;\;\varepsilon = 1/q\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\;i= 1 + \left\lceil\frac{\alpha}{\delta }\right\rceil\;&lt;/math&gt; selects an &lt;math&gt;\;x_i,\;&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x_0) - f(x_i)|= 1/q \ge \varepsilon\quad&lt;/math&gt; and

for all &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0\;:\;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;|x_0 - x_i| =\frac{\alpha}{1 + \left\lceil\frac{\alpha}{\delta }\right\rceil} &lt; \frac{\alpha}{\left\lceil\frac{\alpha}{\delta}\right\rceil} \le \delta,&lt;/math&gt;

which is exactly the definition of discontinuity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

This shows that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is discontinuous on &lt;math&gt;\;\mathbb Q.&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''continuous''' at all irrational numbers, also dense within the real numbers.

{{Collapse top|title=Proof of continuity at irrational arguments|width=80%}}
Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is periodic with period &lt;math&gt;1,\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0\in \mathbb Q,\;&lt;/math&gt; it suffices to check all irrational points in &lt;math&gt;I=(0,\;1).\;&lt;/math&gt; Assume now &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0,\; i \in \mathbb N\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in I \smallsetminus \mathbb Q.\;&lt;/math&gt; According to the [[Archimedean property]] of the reals, there exists &lt;math&gt;r \in \mathbb N\;&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\; 1/r &lt; \varepsilon ,\;&lt;/math&gt; and there exist &lt;math&gt;\; k_i \in \mathbb N,\;&lt;/math&gt; such that

for &lt;math&gt;\quad 1 \le i \le r,\; i \in \mathbb N \; :&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\quad 0 &lt; \frac{k_i}{i} &lt; x_0 &lt; \frac{(k_i +1)}{i}.&lt;/math&gt;

The minimal distance of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; to its  i-th lower and upper bounds equals
:&lt;math&gt;d_i := \min\{\;|x_0 - \frac{k_i}{i}|,\; |x_0 - \frac{(k_i + 1)}{i}| \;\}.&lt;/math&gt;

We define &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; as the minimum of all the finitely many &lt;math&gt;d_i.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta := \min_{1\le i\le r}\{d_i\},\;&lt;/math&gt; so that

for all &lt;math&gt;\quad 1 \le i \le r\; : \quad |x_0 - k_i/i| \ge \delta\quad&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\quad|x_0 - (k_i+1)/i| \ge \delta.&lt;/math&gt;

This is to say, that all these rational numbers &lt;math&gt; k_i/i,\;(k_i + 1)/i,\;&lt;/math&gt; are outside the {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;x_0.&lt;/math&gt;}}

Now let &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{Q} \cap (x_0 - \delta, x_0 + \delta) &lt;/math&gt; with the unique representation &lt;math&gt;x = p/q&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; p, q \in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt; are coprime. Then, necessarily, &lt;math&gt; q &gt; r,\;&lt;/math&gt; and therefore, 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=1/q &lt; 1/r &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, for all irrational &lt;math&gt; x \in I, \; f(x) = 0 = f(x_0);\;&lt;/math&gt; and thus, if &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; then any choice of (sufficiently small) &lt;math&gt; \delta &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; gives 
:&lt;math&gt; |x - x_0| &lt; \delta \implies |f(x_0) - f(x)| = f(x) &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb R \smallsetminus \mathbb Q.\quad&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''nowhere differentiable'''.

{{Collapse top|title=Proof of being nowhere differentiable|width=80%}}
:* For rational numbers, this follows from non-continuity.

:* For irrational numbers:
::All [[sequences]] of irrational numbers &lt;math&gt;(a_i\ne x_0)_{i=1}^\infty\,,\;&lt;/math&gt; converging to the irrational point &lt;math&gt;x_0,\;&lt;/math&gt; imply a constant sequence &lt;math&gt;(f(a_i)=0)_{i=1}^\infty,\;&lt;/math&gt; identical to &lt;math&gt;0,\;&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\lim_{i\to \infty}\left|\frac{f(a_i)-f(x_0)}{a_i - x_0}\right| = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

::According to [[Hurwitz's theorem (number theory)|Hurwitz's theorem]], there also exists a sequence of rational numbers &lt;math&gt;(b_i = k_i/i)_{i=1}^\infty,\;&lt;/math&gt; converging to &lt;math&gt;x_0,\; &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;(k_i \in \mathbb Z,\;i \in \mathbb N)&lt;/math&gt; coprime and &lt;math&gt;|k_i/i -  x_0| &lt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}\cdot i^2}.\;&lt;/math&gt;

::Thus for all &lt;math&gt;i\,:\;\left |\frac{f(b_i)-f(x_0)}{b_i - x_0} \right | &gt; \frac{1/i - 0}{1/(\sqrt{5}\cdot i^2)} =\sqrt{5}\cdot i \ne 0\;&lt;/math&gt; and so {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not differentiable}} at all irrational &lt;math&gt;x_0.&lt;/math&gt;
{{Collapse bottom}}

*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a strict '''[[maxima and minima|local maximum]]''' at each rational number.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
::See the proofs for continuity and discontinuity above for the construction of appropriate neighbourhoods, {{nowrap|where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has}} maxima.

*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Riemann '''integrable''' on any interval and the integral evaluates to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; over any set.

::The [[Lebesgue integrability condition|Lebesgue criterion for integrability]] states that a bounded function is Riemann integrable if and only if the set of all discontinuities has [[Lebesgue measure|measure zero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spivak|1965|p=53|loc=Theorem 3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every [[countability|countable]] subset of the real numbers - such as the rational numbers - has measure zero, so the above discussion shows that Thomae's function is Riemann integrable on any interval. The function's integral is equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; over any set because the function is equal to zero ''[[almost everywhere]]''.

==Follow-up==
A natural follow-up question one might ask is if there is a function which is continuous on the rational numbers and discontinuous on the irrational numbers. This turns out to be impossible; the set of discontinuities of any function must be an [[Fσ set|{{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;}} set]]. If such a function existed, then the irrationals would be an  {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;}} set. The irrationals would then be the countable union of closed sets &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\bigcup_{i = 0}^\infty C_i&lt;/math&gt;, but since the irrationals do not contain an interval, nor can any of the &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, each of the &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; would be nowhere dense, and the irrationals would be a [[meager set]]. It would follow that the real numbers, being a union of the irrationals and the rationals (which is evidently meager), would also be a meager set. This would contradict the [[Baire category theorem]]: because the reals form a [[complete metric space]], they form a [[Baire space]], which cannot be meager in itself.

A variant of Thomae's function can be used to show that any {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;}} subset of the real numbers can be the set of discontinuities of a function. If &lt;math&gt; A =\textstyle \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}F_n&lt;/math&gt; is a countable union of closed sets &lt;math&gt; F_n&lt;/math&gt;, define

:&lt;math&gt;f_A(x) = \begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{n}  &amp; \text{if } x \text{ is rational and }   n \text{ is minimal so that } x \in F_n\\
  -\frac{1}{n} &amp; \text{if } x \text{ is irrational and } n \text{ is minimal so that } x \in F_n\\
  0            &amp; \text{if } x \notin A
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Then a similar argument as for Thomae's function shows that &lt;math&gt; f_A&lt;/math&gt; has ''A'' as its set of discontinuities.

For a general construction on arbitrary metric space, see this article [ftp://softbank.iust.ac.ir/MathBooks/American%20Mathematical%20Monthly/106/3-march/9.pdf Kim, Sung Soo. "A Characterization of the Set of Points of Continuity of a Real Function." American Mathematical Monthly 106.3 (1999): 258-259.]

==Related probability distributions==
Empirical probability distributions related to Thomae's function appear in [[DNA sequencing]].&lt;ref name="Trifonov"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trifonov |first1=Vladimir |last2=Pasqualucci |first2=Laura |last3=Dalla-Favera |first3=Riccardo |last4=Rabadan |first4=Raul |year=2011 |title=Fractal-like Distributions over the Rational Numbers in High-throughput Biological and Clinical Data |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=1 |number=191 |doi=10.1038/srep00191 |pmid=22355706 |pmc=3240948}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human genome is [[diploid]], having two strands per chromosome. When sequenced, small pieces ("reads") are generated: for each spot on the genome, an integer number of reads overlap with it. Their ratio is a rational number, and typically distributed similarly to Thomae's function.

If pairs of positive integers &lt;math&gt;m,n&lt;/math&gt; are sampled from a distribution &lt;math&gt;f(n,m)&lt;/math&gt; and used to generate ratios &lt;math&gt;q=n/(n+m)&lt;/math&gt;, this gives rise to a distribution &lt;math&gt;g(q)&lt;/math&gt; on the rational numbers. If the integers are independent the distribution can be viewed as a [[convolution]] over the rational numbers, &lt;math&gt;g(a/(a+b))=\sum_{t=1}^\infty f(ta)f(tb)&lt;/math&gt;. Closed form solutions exist for [[power-law]] distributions with a cut-off. If &lt;math&gt;f(k)=k^{-\alpha} e^{-\beta k}/\mathrm{Li}_\alpha(e^{-\beta})&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Li}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[polylogarithm]] function) then &lt;math&gt;g(a/(a+b)) = (ab)^{-\alpha} \mathrm{Li}_{2\alpha}(e^{-(a+b)\beta})/\mathrm{Li}^2_{\alpha}(e^{-\beta})&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of uniform distributions on the set &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,\ldots , L\}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;g(a/(a+b)) = (1/L^2) \lfloor L/\max(a,b) \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, which is very similar to Thomae's function. Both their graphs have [[fractal dimension]] 3/2.&lt;ref name="Trifonov" /&gt;

==The ruler function==
For integers, the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; gives 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, ... {{OEIS|id=A007814}}. If 1 is added, or if the 0's are removed, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, ... {{OEIS|id=A001511}}. The values resemble tick-marks on a 1/16th [[Graduation (instrument)|graduated ruler]], hence the name. These values correspond to the restriction of the Thomae function to those rational numbers whose denominators are powers of 2.

This concept, together with its dual concept of [[cotolerance]], was introduced by [[Giorgi Japaridze| Japaridze]] in 1992, who also proved that, for [[Peano arithmetic]] and any stronger theories with effective axiomatizations, tolerance is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1&lt;/math&gt;-consistency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4472">In [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]], the '''torsion conjecture''' or '''uniform boundedness conjecture''' for [[abelian varieties]] states that the [[order (group theory)|order]] of the [[torsion group]] of an abelian variety over a [[number field]] can be bounded in terms of the dimension of the variety and the number field. A stronger version of the conjecture is  that the torsion is bounded in terms of the dimension of the variety and the degree of the number field.

==Elliptic curves==
The (strong) torsion conjecture has been completely resolved in the case of [[elliptic curves]]. [[Barry Mazur]]{{harvs|year=1977|year2=1978|txt=yes}} proved uniform boundedness for elliptic curves over the rationals. His techniques were generalized by {{harvtxt|Kamienny|1992}} and {{harvtxt|Kamienny|Mazur|1995}}, who obtained uniform boundedness for [[quadratic field]]s and number fields of degree at most 8 respectively. Finally, [[Loïc Merel]] ({{harvtxt|1996}}) proved the conjecture for elliptic curves over any number field. The proof centers around a careful study of the rational points on [[classical modular curve]]s. An effective bound for the size of the torsion group in terms of the degree of the number field was given by {{harvtxt|Parent|1999}}.

Mazur provided a complete list of possible torsion subgroups for rational elliptic curves. If ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[cyclic group]] of order ''n'', then the possible torsion subgroups are ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with 1 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 10, and also ''C''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;; and the [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or ''C''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. In the opposite direction, all these torsion structures occur infinitely often over '''Q''', since the corresponding modular curves are all genus zero curves with a rational point. A complete list of possible torsion groups is also available for elliptic curves over quadratic number fields, and there are substantial partial results for cubic and quartic number fields {{harv|Sutherland|2012}}.

The '''triple bar''', [[≡ (disambiguation)|≡]], is a symbol with multiple, context-dependent meanings. It has the appearance of an "[[Equals sign|=]]" sign with a third line. The triple bar character in [[Unicode]] is code point {{unichar|2261|IDENTICAL TO|html=}}.&lt;ref name="hart"&gt;{{citation|title=New Hart's Rules: The Oxford Style Guide|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-957002-7|page=295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=btb1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA295}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The closely related code point {{unichar|2262|NOT IDENTICAL TO|html=}} is the same symbol with a slash through it, indicating the negation of its mathematical meaning.&lt;ref name="hart" /&gt; In [[LaTeX]] mathematical formulas, the code &lt;code&gt;\equiv&lt;/code&gt; produces the triple bar symbol and &lt;code&gt;\not\equiv&lt;/code&gt; produces the negated triple bar symbol as output.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Leslie|last=Lamport|authorlink=Leslie Lamport|title=LaTeX: A Document Preparation System|edition=2nd|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1994|page=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

=== Mathematics and philosophy ===
In [[logic]], it is used with two different but related meanings. It can refer to the [[if and only if]] connective, also called material equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Introduction to the Philosophy of Science|first=Merrilee H.|last=Salmon|publisher=Hackett Publishing|year=1999|isbn=978-0-87220-450-8|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uq7xf0rcCQIC&amp;pg=PA50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[binary operation]] whose value is true when its two arguments have the same value as each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Concise Introduction to Logic|first=Patrick|last=Hurley|edition=12th|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=978-1-285-96556-7|page=338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGBQAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT338}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, in some texts ⇔ is used with this meaning, while ≡ is used for the higher-level [[metalogic]]al notion of [[logical equivalence]], according to which two formulas are logically equivalent when all [[model (logic)|models]] give them the same value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discrete Structures and Automata Theory|first1=Rakesh|last1=Dube|first2=Adesh|last2=Pandey|first3=Ritu|last3=Gupta|publisher=Alpha Science Int'l Ltd.|year=2006|isbn=978-1-84265-256-5|page=277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jd_6ynlwez0C&amp;pg=RA7-PT41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottlob Frege]] used a triple bar for a more philosophical notion of identity, in which two statements (not necessarily in mathematics or formal logic) are identical if they can be freely substituted for each other without change of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Frege Explained|first=Joan|last=Weiner|publisher=Open Court|year=2013|isbn=978-0-8126-9752-0|pages=37–38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZN6e6xEOVwC&amp;pg=PT37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, the triple bar is sometimes used as a symbol of [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] or an [[equivalence relation]] (although not the only one; other common choices include ~ and ≈).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Contemporary Abstract Algebra|first=Joseph|last=Gallian|edition=7th|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2009|isbn=978-0-547-16509-7|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnH3mlOKpsMC&amp;pg=PA16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=1986|first1=J.|last1=Lambek|first2=P.J.|last2=Scott|page=ix|title=Introduction to higher order categorical logic|quote=Remark on notation: throughout this book, we frequently, though not exclusively, use the symbol ≡ for definitional equality.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, in [[geometry]], it may be used either to show that two figures are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] or that they are identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A History of Mathematical Notations|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first=Florian|last=Cajori|authorlink=Florian Cajori|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2013|isbn=978-0-486-16116-7|page=418|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_byqAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA418}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In number theory, it has been used beginning with [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (who first used it with this meaning in 1801) to mean [[modular arithmetic|modular congruence]]: &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b \pmod N&lt;/math&gt; if ''N'' divides ''a'' − ''b''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Shaping of Arithmetic after C.F. Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae|first1=Catherine|last1=Goldstein|authorlink=Catherine Goldstein|first2=Norbert|last2=Schappacher|first3= Joachim|last3= Schwermer|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=978-3-540-34720-0|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUFTcOsMTysC&amp;pg=PA21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cajori|2013}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_byqAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 p.&amp;nbsp;34].&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used for "identical equality" of functions; one writes &lt;math&gt;f \equiv g&lt;/math&gt; for two functions ''f'', ''g'' if we have &lt;math&gt;f(x) = g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algebra: For High Schools and Colleges|first=Ellen|last=Hayes|publisher	=J. S. Cushing|year=1897|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6hMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[category theory]], triple bars may be used to connect objects in a [[commutative diagram]], indicating that they are actually the same object rather than being connected by an arrow of the category.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Encapsulation of State with Monad Transformers|first=Steven E.|last=Ganz|series=Ph.D. thesis, Indiana University|publisher=ProQuest|year=2007|isbn=978-0-493-91365-0|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mb9dShHum4gC&amp;pg=PA25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This symbol is also sometimes used in place of an equal sign for equations that define the symbol on the [[left-hand side]] of the equation, to contrast them with equations in which the terms on both sides of the equation were already defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Intermediate analysis: an introduction to the theory of functions of one real variable|first1=John|last1=Meigs|first2=Hubbell|last2=Olmsted|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|year=1956|page=vi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative notation for this usage is to typeset the letters "def" above an ordinary equality sign, &lt;math&gt;a\overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}b&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamport|1994}}, p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science ===
In [[botanical nomenclature]], the triple bar denotes homotypic [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] (those based on the same [[type specimen]]), to distinguish them from heterotypic synonyms (those based on different type specimens), which are marked with an [[equals sign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |title=Guidelines for authors |journal=[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]] |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=211–214 |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/downloads/guidelines_authors.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], the triple bar can be used to represent a [[triple bond]] between atoms. For example, HC≡CH is a common shorthand for [[acetylene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Chemistry: The Molecular Science|first1=John|last1=Olmsted|first2=Gregory M.|last2=Williams|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8151-8450-8|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1vnk6J8knKkC&amp;pg=PA86}}&lt;/ref&gt; (systematic name: ethyne).

=== Application design ===
{{See also|Hamburger button}}In [[mobile app|mobile]], [[website|web]], and general [[Application software|application]] design, a similar symbol is sometimes used as an interface element, where it is called a [[hamburger button|hamburger icon]]. The element typically indicates that a [[Web navigation|navigation menu]] can be accessed when the element is activated; the bars of the symbol may be seen as stylized menu items, and some variations of this symbols add more bars, or bullet points to each bar, to enhance this visual similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Learning Responsive Web Design: A Beginner's Guide|first=Clarissa|last=Peterson|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4493-6369-7|pages=338–339|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULTIAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA338}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of this symbol dates back to the early computer interfaces developed at [[Xerox PARC]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Norm|title=The origin of the hamburger icon|url=https://www.evernote.com/shard/s207/sh/022f2237-4b4f-4096-87f2-053acd228c2d/ede2672bc3f39a1b0232f84e01ca0a83|website=Evernote}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also similar to the icon frequently used to indicate [[text justification|justified text alignment]]. It is an oft-used component of [[Google|Google's]] [[Material Design]] guidelines and many [[Android (operating system)|Android]] apps and web apps that follow these guidelines make use of the hamburger menu.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4427">In a [[quantum field theory]], one may calculate an effective or [[running coupling constant]] that defines the coupling of the theory measured at a given momentum scale. One example of such a coupling constant is the [[electric charge]].  In approximate calculations in several quantum field theories, notably [[quantum electrodynamics]] and theories of the [[Higgs particle]], the running coupling appears to become infinite at a finite momentum scale. This is sometimes called the [[Landau pole]] problem.  It is not known whether the appearance of these inconsistencies is an artifact of the approximation, or a real fundamental problem in the theory.  However, the problem can be avoided if an ultraviolet or '''UV fixed point''' appears in the theory. A quantum field theory has a UV fixed point if its [[renormalization group flow]] approaches a [[Renormalization group|fixed point]] in the ultraviolet (i.e. short length scale/large energy) limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kenneth G.|author2=Kogut, John B. |title=The renormalization group and the ε expansion|journal=Physics Reports|year=1974|volume=12|issue=2|pages=75–199|doi=10.1016/0370-1573(74)90023-4|bibcode = 1974PhR....12...75W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is related to zeroes of the [[beta-function]] appearing in the [[Callan-Symanzik equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zinn-Justin|first=Jean|title=Quantum Field Theory and Critical Phenomena|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large length scale/small energy limit counterpart is the [[infrared fixed point]].

==Specific cases and details==
Among other things, it means that a theory possessing a UV fixed point may not be an [[effective field theory]], because it is well-defined at arbitrarily small distance scales. At the UV fixed point itself, the theory can behave as a [[conformal field theory]].

The converse statement, that any [[quantum field theory|QFT]] which is valid at all distance scales (i.e. isn't an effective field theory) has a UV fixed point is false. See, for example, [[cascading gauge theory]].

[[noncommutative quantum field theory|Noncommutative quantum field theories]] have a UV cutoff even though they are not effective field theories.

Physicists distinguish between trivial and nontrivial fixed points.  If a UV fixed point is [[trivial fixed point|trivial]] (generally known as Gaussian fixed point), the theory is said to be [[asymptotic freedom|asymptotically free]]. On the other hand, a scenario, where a non-Gaussian (i.e. nontrival) fixed point is approached in the UV limit, is referred to as [[asymptotic safety]].&lt;ref name="NR06"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Niedermaier|first1=Max|last2=Reuter|first2=Martin|title= The Asymptotic Safety Scenario in Quantum Gravity|year=2006|journal=Living Rev. Relativ.|volume=9|page=5|url=http://www.livingreviews.org/lrr-2006-5|bibcode = 2006LRR.....9....5N |doi = 10.12942/lrr-2006-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asymptotically safe theories may be well defined at all scales despite being [[nonrenormalizable]] in perturbative sense (according to the [[classical scaling dimension]]s).

==Asymptotic safety scenario in quantum gravity==
{{Main|Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity}}
[[Steven Weinberg]] has proposed that the problematic [[Ultraviolet divergence|UV divergences]] appearing in [[quantum gravity|quantum theories of gravity]] may be cured by means of a nontrivial UV fixed point.&lt;ref name="Weinberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Steven|title=Ultraviolet divergences in quantum theories of gravitation|year=1979|publisher=In "General Relativity: An Einstein centenary survey", ed. S. W. Hawking and W. Israel. Cambridge University Press|pages=790–831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity|asymptotically safe]] theory is renormalizable in a nonperturbative sense, and due to the fixed point physical quantities are free from divergences. As yet, a general proof for the existence of the fixed point is still lacking, but there is mounting evidence for this scenario.&lt;ref name="NR06" /&gt;

&lt;!--Hey can we get a picture (including the tangent values) of the points of interest on the unit circle with the tangent values shown also?--&gt;[[Image:Unit circle.svg|Unit circle|right|thumb|186px|Illustration of a unit circle. The variable ''t'' is an [[angle]] measure.]]
[[File:2pi-unrolled.gif|thumb|260px|Animation of the act of unrolling the circumference of a unit circle, a circle with radius of 1. Since {{math|''C'' {{=}} 2π''r''}}, the circumference of a unit circle is {{math|2π}}.]] 

In [[mathematics]], a '''unit circle''' is a [[circle]] with a [[radius]] of [[1 (number)|one]].  Frequently, especially in [[trigonometry]], the unit circle is the circle of radius one centered at the origin (0, 0) in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in the [[Euclidean plane]]. The unit circle is often denoted {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}; the generalization to higher dimensions is the [[unit sphere]].

If {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} is a point on the unit circle's circumference, then {{math|{{abs|''x''}}}} and {{math|{{abs|''y''}}}} are the lengths of the legs of a [[right triangle]] whose hypotenuse has length 1. Thus, by the [[Pythagorean theorem]], {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} satisfy the equation

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} (−''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for all {{math|''x''}}, and since the reflection of any point on the unit circle about the {{math|''x''}}- or {{math|''y''}}-axis is also on the unit circle, the above equation holds for all points {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} on the unit circle, not only those in the first quadrant.

The interior of the unit circle is called the open [[unit disk]], while the interior of the unit circle combined with the unit circle itself is called the closed unit disk.

One may also use other notions of "distance" to define other "unit circles", such as the [[Riemannian circle]]; see the article on [[norm (mathematics)|mathematical norms]] for additional examples.

==In the complex plane==
The unit circle can be considered as the [[unit complex numbers]], i.e., the set of [[complex numbers]] {{math|''z''}} of the form 
:&lt;math&gt; z = \,\mathrm{e}^{i t}\, = \cos(t) + i \sin(t) = \operatorname{cis}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{math|''t''}} (see also: [[cis (mathematics)|cis]]).  This relation represents [[Euler's formula]].
In [[quantum mechanics]], this is referred to as [[phase factor]].

==Trigonometric functions on the unit circle==
[[Image:Circle-trig6.svg|right|thumb|300px|All of the trigonometric functions of the angle {{math|''θ''}} (theta) can be constructed geometrically in terms of a unit circle centered at ''O''.]]
[[File:Periodic sine.PNG|thumb|Sine function on unit circle (top) and its graph (bottom)]]
The [[trigonometric function]]s cosine and sine of angle {{math|''θ''}} may be defined on the unit circle as follows: If {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} is a point on the unit circle, and if the ray from the origin (0, 0) to {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} makes an [[angle]] {{math|''θ''}} from the positive {{math|''x''}}-axis, (where counterclockwise turning is positive), then

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta) = x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta) = y&lt;/math&gt;

The equation {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}} gives the relation

:&lt;math&gt; \cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The unit circle also demonstrates that [[sine]] and [[cosine]] are [[periodic function]]s, with the identities

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta = \cos(2\pi k+\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \sin(2\pi k+\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
for any [[integer]] {{math|''k''}}.

Triangles constructed on the unit circle can also be used to illustrate the periodicity of the trigonometric functions. First, construct a radius OA from the origin to a point {{math|P(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} on the unit circle such that an angle {{math|''t''}} with {{math|0 &lt; ''t'' &lt; {{sfrac|π|2}}}} is formed with the positive arm of the {{math|''x''}}-axis. Now consider a point {{math|Q(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,0)}} and line segments {{math|PQ ⊥ OQ}}. The result is a right triangle {{math|△OPQ}} with {{math|∠QOP {{=}} ''t''}}. Because {{math|PQ}} has length {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|OQ}} length {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|OA}} length 1, {{math|sin(''t'') {{=}} ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|cos(''t'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Having established these equivalences, take another radius OR from the origin to a point  {{math|R(−''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} on the circle such that the same angle {{math|''t''}} is formed with the negative arm of the {{math|''x''}}-axis. Now consider a point {{math|S(−''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,0)}} and line segments {{math|RS ⊥ OS}}. The result is a right triangle {{math|△ORS}} with {{math|∠SOR {{=}} ''t''}}. It can hence be seen that, because {{math|∠ROQ {{=}} π − ''t''}}, {{math|R}} is at {{math|(cos(π − ''t''),sin(π − ''t''))}} in the same way that P is at {{math|(cos(''t''),sin(''t''))}}. The conclusion is that, since  {{math|(−''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the same as {{math|(cos(π − ''t''),sin(π − ''t''))}} and {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the same as {{math|(cos(''t''),sin(''t''))}}, it is true that {{math|sin(''t'') {{=}} sin(π − ''t'')}} and {{math|−cos(''t'') {{=}} cos(π − ''t'')}}. It may be inferred in a similar manner that {{math|tan(π − ''t'') {{=}} −tan(''t'')}}, since {{math|tan(''t'') {{=}} {{sfrac|''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} and {{math|tan(π − ''t'') {{=}} {{sfrac|''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|−''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}. A simple demonstration of the above can be seen in the equality {{math|sin({{sfrac|π|4}}) {{=}} sin({{sfrac|3π|4}}) {{=}} {{sfrac|1|{{sqrt|2}}}}}}.

When working with right triangles, sine, cosine, and other trigonometric functions only make sense for angle measures more than zero and less than {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}. However, when defined with the unit circle, these functions produce meaningful values for any [[real number|real]]-valued angle measure&amp;nbsp;– even those greater than 2{{pi}}. In fact, all six standard trigonometric functions&amp;nbsp;– sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant, as well as archaic functions like [[versine]] and [[exsecant]]&amp;nbsp;– can be defined geometrically in terms of a unit circle, as shown at right.

Using the unit circle, the values of any trigonometric function for many angles other than those labeled can be calculated without the use of a calculator by using the [[Trigonometric identity#Angle sum and difference identities|angle sum and difference formulas]].

==Circle group==
{{Main|Circle group}}
[[Complex number]]s can be identified with points in the [[Euclidean plane]], namely the number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} is identified with the point {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}. Under this identification, the unit circle is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication, called the ''circle group''; it is usually denoted {{math|𝕋}}. On the plane, multiplication by {{math|cos ''θ'' + ''i'' sin ''θ''}} gives a counterclockwise rotation by {{math|''θ''}}. This group has important applications in mathematics and science.{{Such as?}}

==Complex dynamics==

is a unit circle. It is a simplest case so it is widely used in study of dynamical systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2645">The '''Urysohn universal space''' is a certain [[metric space]] that contains all [[separable space|separable]] metric spaces in a particularly nice manner. This [[mathematics]] concept is due to [[Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn]].

==Definition==
A metric space (''U'',''d'') is called ''Urysohn universal''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Geometric embeddings of metric spaces|url=http://www.math.jyu.fi/research/reports/rep90.ps|author=Juha Heinonen|date=January 2003|accessdate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; if it is separable and [[complete space|complete]] and has the following property: 
:given any finite metric space ''X'', any point ''x'' in ''X'', and any [[isometry|isometric embedding]] ''f'' : ''X''\{''x''} → ''U'', there exists an isometric embedding ''F'' : ''X'' → ''U'' that extends ''f'', i.e. such that ''F''(''y'') = ''f''(''y'') for all ''y'' in ''X''\{''x''}.

==Properties==
If ''U'' is Urysohn universal and ''X'' is any separable metric space, then there exists an isometric embedding ''f'':''X'' → ''U''. (Other spaces share this property: for instance, the space ''l''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; of all bounded real [[sequence]]s with the [[uniform norm|supremum norm]] admits isometric embeddings of all separable metric spaces ("[[Maurice René Fréchet|Fréchet]] embedding"), as does the space C[0,1] of all [[continuous function]]s [0,1]→'''R''', again with the supremum norm, a result due to [[Stefan Banach]].)

Furthermore, every isometry between finite subsets of ''U'' extends to an isometry of ''U'' onto itself. This kind of "homogeneity" actually characterizes Urysohn universal spaces: A separable complete metric space that contains an isometric image of every separable metric space is Urysohn universal if and only if it is homogeneous in this sense.

==Existence and uniqueness==
Urysohn proved that an Urysohn universal space exists, and that any two Urysohn universal spaces are [[isometry|isometric]]. This can be seen as follows. Take &lt;math&gt;(X,d),(X',d')&lt;/math&gt;, two Urysohn spaces. These are separable, so fix in the respective spaces countable dense subsets &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_n, (x'_n)_n&lt;/math&gt;. These must be properly infinite, so by a back-and-forth argument, one can step-wise construct partial isometries &lt;math&gt;\phi_n:X\to X'&lt;/math&gt; whose domain (resp. range) contains &lt;math&gt;\{x_k:k&lt;n\}&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\{x'_k:k&lt;n\}&lt;/math&gt;). The union of these maps defines a partial isometry &lt;math&gt;\phi:X\to X'&lt;/math&gt; whose domain resp. range are dense in the respective spaces. And such maps extend (uniquely) to isometries, since a Urysohn space is required to be complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4476">In [[representation theory]], a branch of mathematics, the '''Whittaker model''' is a realization of a [[Group representation|representation]] of a [[reductive algebraic group]] such as ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over a [[finite field|finite]] or [[local field|local]] or [[global field]] on a space of functions on the group. It is named after [[E. T. Whittaker]] even though he never worked in this area, because {{harvs|last=Jacquet|year1=1966|year2=1967}} pointed out that for the group SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''')  some of the functions involved in the representation are [[Whittaker function]]s.

[[Irreducible representation]]s without a Whittaker model are sometimes called "degenerate", and those with a Whittaker model are sometimes called "generic". The representation [[θ10|θ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]] of the [[symplectic group]] Sp&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the simplest example of a degenerate representation.

==Whittaker models for GL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;==

If ''G'' is the [[algebraic group]] ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and '''F''' is a local field,
and τ is a fixed non-trivial [[Character theory|character]] of the additive group of '''F''' and π is an irreducible representation of a general linear group ''G''('''F'''), then the Whittaker model for π is a representation π on a space of  functions ''f'' on ''G''('''F''') satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; b \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}g\right) = \tau(b)f(g). &lt;/math&gt;

{{harvtxt|Jacquet|Langlands|1970}} used Whittaker models to assign L-functions to [[admissible representation]]s of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Whittaker models for GL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;==

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be the [[general linear group]] &lt;math&gt;{\rm GL}_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; a smooth complex valued non-trivial additive character of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; the subgroup of &lt;math&gt;{\rm GL}_n&lt;/math&gt; consisting of unipotent upper triangular matrices. A non-degenerate character on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\chi(u)=\psi(\alpha_1x_{12}+\alpha_2x_{23}+\cdots+\alpha_{n-1}x_{n-1n}),&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;u=(x_{ij})&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and non-zero &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;(\pi,V)&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth representation of &lt;math&gt;G(F)&lt;/math&gt;, a '''Whittaker functional''' &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous linear functional on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda(\pi(u)v)=\chi(u)\lambda(v)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. '''Multiplicity one''' states that, for &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; unitary irreducible, the space of Whittaker functionals has dimension at most equal to one.

==Whittaker models for reductive groups==

If ''G'' is a split reductive group and ''U'' is the unipotent radical of  a Borel subgroup ''B'', then a Whittaker model for a representation is an embedding of it into the induced ([[Gelfand–Graev representation|Gelfand–Graev]]) representation Ind{{su|b=''U''|p=''G''}}(χ), where χ is a non-degenerate character of ''U'', such as the sum of the characters corresponding to simple roots.

In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], '''[[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]] regularization''' is a type of [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] or [[summability method]] that assigns finite values to  [[Divergent series|divergent sums]] or products, and in particular can be used to define [[determinant]]s and [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]]s of some [[self-adjoint operator]]s. The technique is now commonly applied to problems in [[physics]], but has its origins in attempts to give precise meanings to ill-conditioned sums appearing in [[number theory]].

==Definition==

There are several different summation methods called zeta function regularization for defining the sum of a possibly divergent series {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ....}}

One method is to define its zeta regularized sum to be ζ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;minus;1) if this is defined, where the zeta function is defined for Re(''s'') large by

:&lt;math&gt; \zeta_A(s) = \frac{1}{a_1^s}+\frac{1}{a_2^s} +\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

if this sum converges, and by [[analytic continuation]] elsewhere.

In the case when ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n'', the zeta function is the ordinary [[Riemann zeta function]], and this method was used by [[Euler]] to "sum" the series [[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ...]] to ζ(&amp;minus;1) = &amp;minus;1/12.

Other values of ''s'' can also be used to assign values for the divergent sums

: [[1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ...]] → ζ(0) = −1/2, 1 + 4 + 9 + ... → ζ(−2) = 0

and in general

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^s=1^s + 2^s + 3^s + \cdots \rightarrow \zeta(-s) = -\frac{B_{s+1}}{s+1},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Bernoulli number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/the-euler-maclaurin-formula-bernoulli-numbers-the-zeta-function-and-real-variable-analytic-continuation/|title=The Euler-Maclaurin formula, Bernoulli numbers, the zeta function, and real-variable analytic continuation|first=Terence|last=Tao|date=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Hawking|1977}} showed that in flat space, in which the eigenvalues of Laplacians are known, the [[zeta function (operator)|zeta function]] corresponding to the [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]] can be computed explicitly. Consider a scalar field ''φ'' contained in a large box of volume ''V'' in flat spacetime at the temperature ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''β''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The partition function is defined by a [[path integral formulation|path integral]] over all fields ''φ'' on the Euclidean space obtained by putting ''τ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''it'' which are zero on the walls of the box and which are periodic in ''τ'' with period ''β''. In this situation from the partition function he computes energy, entropy and pressure of the radiation of the field&amp;nbsp;''φ''. In case of flat spaces the eigenvalues appearing in the physical quantities are generally known, while in case of curved space they are  not known: in this case asymptotic methods are needed.

Another method defines the possibly divergent infinite product ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.... to be  exp(&amp;minus;ζ&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(0)). {{harvtxt|Ray|Singer|1971}} used this to define the [[determinant]] of a positive [[self-adjoint operator]] ''A'' (the [[Laplacian operator|Laplacian]] of a [[Riemannian manifold]] in their application) with [[eigenvalue]]s ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., and in this case the zeta function is formally the trace of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;. {{harvtxt|Minakshisundaram|Pleijel|1949}} showed that if ''A'' is the Laplacian of a compact Riemannian manifold then the [[Minakshisundaram–Pleijel zeta function]]  converges and has an analytic continuation as a meromorphic function to all complex numbers, and {{harvtxt|Seeley|1967}} extended this to [[Elliptic differential operator|elliptic pseudo-differential operator]]s ''A'' on compact Riemannian manifolds. So for such operators one can define the determinant using zeta function regularization. See "[[analytic torsion]]."

{{harvtxt|Hawking|1977}} suggested using this idea to evaluate path integrals in curved spacetimes. He studied zeta function regularization in order to calculate the partition functions for thermal graviton and matter's quanta in curved background such as on the horizon of black holes and on de Sitter background using the relation by the inverse [[Mellin transform]]ation to the trace of the kernel of [[heat equation]]s.

==Example==

The first example in which zeta function regularization is available appears in the Casimir effect, which is in a flat space with the bulk contributions of the quantum field in three space dimensions. In this case we must calculate the value of Riemann zeta function at ''-3'', which diverges explicitly. However, it can be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] to ''s=-3'' where hopefully there is no pole, thus giving a finite value to the expression. A detailed example of this regularization at work is given in the article on the detail example of the [[Casimir effect#Derivation of Casimir effect assuming zeta-regularization|Casimir effect]], where the resulting sum is very explicitly the [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann zeta-function]] (and where the seemingly legerdemain analytic continuation removes an additive infinity, leaving a physically significant finite number).

An example of zeta-function regularization is the calculation of the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the [[energy]] of a particle field in [[quantum field theory]]. More generally, the zeta-function approach can be used to regularize the whole [[energy-momentum tensor]] in curved spacetime. {{ref|Mo97}} {{ref|BCEMZ}}

The unregulated value of the energy is given by a summation over the [[zero-point energy]] of all of the excitation modes of the vacuum:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle 0|T_{00} |0\rangle = \sum_n \frac{\hbar |\omega_n|}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;T_{00}&lt;/math&gt; is the zeroth component of the energy-momentum tensor and the sum (which may be an integral) is understood to extend over all (positive and negative) energy modes &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt;; the absolute value reminding us that the energy is taken to be positive. This sum, as written, is usually infinite (&lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; is typically linear in n). The sum may be [[regularization (physics)|regularized]] by writing it as

:&lt;math&gt;\langle 0|T_{00}(s) |0\rangle =
\sum_n \frac{\hbar |\omega_n|}{2} |\omega_n|^{-s}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is some parameter, taken to be a [[complex number]]. For large, [[real number|real]] ''s'' greater than 4 (for three-dimensional space), the sum is manifestly finite, and thus may often be evaluated theoretically.

The zeta-regularization is useful as it can often be used in a way such that the various symmetries of the physical system are preserved. Zeta-function regularization is used in [[conformal field theory]], [[renormalization]] and in fixing the critical [[spacetime]] dimension of [[string theory]].

==Relation to other regularizations==

We can ask if are there any relation to the [[dimensional regularization]] originated by the Feynman diagram. But now we may say they are equivalent each other, see{{ref|BCEMZ}}. However the main advantage of the zeta regularization is that it can be used whenever the dimensional regularization fails, for example if there are matrices or tensors inside the calculations &lt;math&gt; \epsilon _{i,j,k} &lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to Dirichlet series==

Zeta-function regularization gives an analytic structure to any sums over an [[arithmetic function]] ''f''(''n''). Such sums are known as [[Dirichlet series]]. The regularized form

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)n^{-s}&lt;/math&gt;

converts divergences of the sum into [[simple pole]]s on the complex ''s''-plane.  In numerical calculations, the zeta-function regularization is inappropriate, as it is extremely slow to converge. For numerical purposes, a more rapidly converging sum is the exponential regularization, given by

:&lt;math&gt;F(t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n) e^{-tn}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is sometimes called the [[Z-transform]] of ''f'', where ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;exp(&amp;minus;''t''). The analytic structure of the exponential and zeta-regularizations are related.  By expanding the exponential sum as a [[Laurent series]]

:&lt;math&gt;F(t)=\frac{a_N}{t^N} + \frac{a_{N-1}}{t^{N-1}} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

one finds that the zeta-series has the structure

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}(s) = \frac{a_N}{s-N} + \cdots. &lt;/math&gt;

The structure of the exponential and zeta-regulators are related by means of the [[Mellin transform]]. The one may be converted to the other by making use of the integral representation of the [[Gamma function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(s+1)=\int_0^\infty x^s e^{-x} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

which lead to the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(s+1) \tilde{f}(s+1) = \int_0^\infty t^s F(t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

relating the exponential and zeta-regulators, and converting poles in the s-plane to divergent terms in the Laurent series.

==Heat kernel regularization==
The sum
:&lt;math&gt;f(s)=\sum_n a_n e^{-s|\omega_n|}&lt;/math&gt;

is sometimes called a '''heat kernel''' or a '''heat-kernel regularized sum'''; this name stems from the idea that the &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; can sometimes be understood as eigenvalues of the [[heat kernel]]. In mathematics, such a sum is known as a generalized [[Dirichlet series]]; its use for averaging is known as an [[Abelian mean]]. It is closely related to the [[Laplace–Stieltjes transform]], in that

:&lt;math&gt;f(s)=\int_0^\infty e^{-st} \, d\alpha(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[step function]], with steps of &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;t=|\omega_n|&lt;/math&gt;.  A number of theorems for the convergence of such a series exist. For example, by the Hardy-Littlewood Tauberian theorem, if {{ref|Apostol}}

:&lt;math&gt;L=\limsup_{n\to\infty} \frac{\log\vert\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\vert}{|\omega_n|}&lt;/math&gt;

then the series for &lt;math&gt;f(s)&lt;/math&gt; converges in the half-plane &lt;math&gt;\Re(s)&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and is [[uniformly convergent]] on every [[compact subset]] of the half-plane &lt;math&gt;\Re(s)&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. In almost all applications to physics, one has &lt;math&gt;L=0&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
Much of the early work establishing the convergence and equivalence of series regularized with the heat kernel and zeta function regularization methods was done by [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[J. E. Littlewood]] in 1916{{ref|Hard16}} and is based on the application of the [[Cahen–Mellin integral]]. The effort was made in order to obtain values for various ill-defined, [[conditionally convergent]] sums appearing in [[number theory]].

In terms of application as the regulator in physical problems, before {{harvtxt|Hawking|1977}}, J. Stuart Dowker and Raymond Critchley in 1976 proposed a zeta-function regularization method for quantum physical problems.{{ref|Do76}} Emilio Elizalde and others have also proposed a method based on the zeta regularization for the integrals &lt;math&gt; \int_{a}^{\infty}x^{m-s}dx &lt;/math&gt;, here &lt;math&gt; x^{-s} &lt;/math&gt; is a regulator and the divergent integral depends on the numbers &lt;math&gt; \zeta (s-m) &lt;/math&gt; in the limit &lt;math&gt; s \to 0 &lt;/math&gt; see [[renormalization]]. Also unlike other regularizations such as [[dimensional regularization]] and analytic regularization, zeta regularization has no counterterms and gives only finite results.
