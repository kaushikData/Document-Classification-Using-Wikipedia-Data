      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2179">The '''1st Višegrad Brigade''' (''Prva višegradska brigada'') was a [[brigade]] of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] during the [[Bosnian War]]. Its commander was [[Ahmet Sejdić]]. The brigade was established on 9 June 1992, made up of refugees and survivors of the [[Višegrad massacres|1992 massacres]] from [[Višegrad]], mostly ethnic [[Bosniaks]]. Most of the members of the unit had no military training, but they were praised for their professionalism and bravery by Bosnian leaders at the time. 1,975 people were part of the brigade at some point, and 234 of them were killed in action.&lt;ref name=Rogatica&gt;{{cite web|title=Biti svjedok istine|url=http://www.rogatica.com/index.php/kazivanja/1364-biti-svjedok-istine-na-rogaticacom|website=Rogatica.com|accessdate=10 September 2014|date=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BPKG&gt;{{cite web|title=20. godišnjica 1.

It successfully defended pockets of the Višegrad area from mid-1992 until May 1993. After the fall of positions in the [[Rogatica]] area, faced with the possibility of being cut off from [[Goražde]] and dwindling supplies, the decision was made to safely pull out towards Goražde. This was done with the aim to one day liberate Višegrad, which before the genocide had a large Bosniak population. Unfortunately for the members of the brigade, that day never occurred, and today Višegrad is a primarily Serb town in the [[Republika Srpska]].&lt;ref name=Rogatica/&gt;&lt;ref name=BPKG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borger|first1=Julian|title=War is over – now Serbs and Bosniaks fight to win control of a brutal history|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/war-serbs-bosniaks-history-visegrad|accessdate=10 September 2014|work=The Guardian|date=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''L'Orchestra African Fiesta''', often known simply as '''African Fiesta''', was a [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] [[soukous]] band started by [[Tabu Ley Rochereau]] and [[Dr. Nico Kasanda]] in 1963. 

Tabu Ley and Dr. Nico were originally members of the seminal band [[Grand Kalle et l'African Jazz]]. They left African Jazz and started their own group, African Fiesta, with which they helped elevate the genre of African rumba into the genre now known as [[Soukous]].

Tension between Tabu Ley and Dr. Nico led to a split in 1965, with Tabu Ley renaming the band '''African Fiesta National''' and Dr. Nico forming '''African Fiesta Sukisa'''. Dr. Nico withdrew from the music scene in the mid-1970s. 

Tabu Ley and African Fiesta National continued to dominate the Congolese musical scene. By 1970, their records routinely sold in the millions. African Fiesta National served as a breeding ground for such future African music stars as vocalist [[Sam Mangwana]].

In 1970, Tabu Ley formed '''Orchestre Afrisa International''', Afrisa being a combination of Africa and Éditions Isa, his Record label.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox bilateral relations|Algeria–Israel|Algeria|Israel|}}

'''Algeria–Israel relations''' refers to the [[bilateralism|current and historical relations]] between [[Algeria]] and [[Israel]]. The two states do not have any official diplomatic relations at all. Algeria refuses entry to any citizen holding an [[Israeli passport]] or any other visa from Israel.

==History==

Algeria sent a battalion of infantry and a squadron of MiG-21s to Egypt during the 1967, it lost three Mig-29s to Israel during the six day war &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Country-By-Country/Algeria.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918015323/http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Country-By-Country/Algeria.htm |archive-date=2012-09-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Yom Kippur War]] Algeria sent a expeditionary force to fight Israel, it included 59 air planes (Mig 21 , Mig 17 , Su-7) an infantry platoon and an armored brigade (estimated 19 artillery weapons).

In the mid 1990s, while Israel and North African states slowly started diplomatic relations, Algeria remained one of the last countries to consider such a move. It was only when [[Israeli prime minister]] [[Ehud Barak]] met [[Algerian President]] [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] at the funeral of the [[Kings of Morocco|Moroccan King]] [[Hasan II]] on July 25, 1999 that comments about rapprochement were made.

The '''Antrea Net''' is one of the oldest known [[fishing net|fishing nets]] in the world, found from [[Karelian Isthmus|Karelian isthmus]] in [[Antrea]], in Korpilahti village in 1913. It is dated to 8540 BCE.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Karjalan synty|last=edited by Matti Saarnisto|first=|publisher=Gummerus Kirjapaino Oy|year=2003|isbn=952-5200-37-X|location=Jyväskylä|pages=171-173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The net is at display in the [[National Museum of Finland]].

The net was found by farmer Antti Virolainen in [[Antrea]], [[Finland]] (today [[Kamennogorsk]], [[Russia]]) in autumn of 1913 at his home farm Ämmä-Mattila. While he was ditching a swamp [[meadow]], he found several stone and bone objects which got his attention. The site was excavated by the Finnish archaeologist [[Sakari Pälsi]] in July 1914. In his excavation, Pälsi found 18 [[Bobber (fishing)|bobbers]] and 31 net weights and parts of the net. He also found several stone and bone objects, some [[Birch bark|birchbark]] and pieces of [[tinder fungus]]. All the items where found in relatively small area, and they had likely come to the scene at the same time in one piece. The items were sunk to the bottom clay of the [[Ancylus Lake]] that existed during that period, most likely in an accident that made the fisherman's boat capsize and lose all his equipment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Antrean verkon kaivaus Sakari Pälsin kuvaamana 1914.jpg|thumb|Photo from the excavations of the Antrea Net by [[Sakari Pälsi]] in the summer of 1914. The photo shows the bobbers on the front and the netweights on the background.]]
The net is made out of [[willow]] and it is 27–30 metres long by 1.3-1.5 metres wide, with a 6&amp;nbsp;cm mesh. The size of the mesh is suitable for fishing [[salmon]] and [[common bream]]. The net is laced with a knot called [[Ryssänsolmu]], which has been in use until much later dates in [[Estonia]] and areas of [[Baltic Finns]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Contarini–Rosselli map''' of 1506 was the first printed world map showing the New World. 

The Contarini–Rosselli map was designed by [[Giovanni Matteo Contarini]] and engraved by [[Francesco Rosselli]]. It is a copper-engraved map and was published in [[Venice]] or [[Florence]] in 1506. The only surviving copy is in the [[British Library]].

==Age of discovery==
There had been many voyages of discovery in the immediately preceding years:
* [[Bartolomeu Dias|Dias]]’ rounding of Africa (1487)
* the discovery of Newfoundland by [[John Cabot]] (1497)
* [[Vasco da Gama]]’s travel to India (1499)
* the explorations of the Caribbean and South America by [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] (1492–93, 1493–94, 1498, 1502–04)
* visits to the Caribbean and South America by [[Amerigo Vespucci|Vespucci]] (1499, 1501–02)

Although there had been maps created after these voyages, such as [[Juan de la Cosa]]’s map of the world in 1500 (based on Columbus' second voyage) and the [[Cantino planisphere|Cantino]] world map (circa 1502), the information on these maps was closely guarded. These maps were commissioned by the Portuguese and Spanish governments, which wanted to create trade monopolies over the regions they depicted. The royal powers worried that leaked information about geography could make it easier for other nations to challenge their supremacy. Often a limited number of copies was made, to be held under lock and key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5nMCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;ots=dBQgeFwBui&amp;dq=contarini-rosselli%20map&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q=contarini-rosselli%20map&amp;f=false|title=Worldly Consumers: The Demand for Maps in Renaissance Italy|last=Carlton|first=Genevieve|date=2015-06-22|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226255316|location=|pages=60-62|language=en|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publicizing the shape of the world ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
This situation changed drastically from 1506 to 1507 when three separate efforts to produce world maps were published. The [[Contarini-Rosselli]] map of 1506 (now in the [[British Library]]) and [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s map of the world and globe of 1507 were influential, but not very widely published. There is only one original copy of each in existence, and both of these copies were discovered in the 20th century. 

By contrast, [[Johannes Ruysch]]'s 1507 map of the world was much more widely published and many copies were produced and still exist. It therefore had a very large influence.

'''Sir Dagonet''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|æ|ɡ|ə|ˌ|n|ɛ|t|,_|ˌ|d|æ|ɡ|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|t}} was [[King Arthur]]'s well-beloved [[jester]], and a Knight of the [[Round Table]] of [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]]. He saw himself as a courageous warrior and would present himself as such. Yet, in reality, he would flee at the slightest provocation. He often battered his own shield so that it appeared that he had been in a fight – telling all that he emerged victorious of course.

Dagonet’s tom-foolery was legendary. He once playfully "captured" [[Lancelot|Sir Lancelot]] by leading his horse to [[Guinevere|Queen Guinevere]] and the noble knight was dubbed "Dagonet's Prisoner" to great hilarity. During the False Guinevere’s reign, the jester took on the administration of the Royal Court and bankrupted the household. Yet, the unfortunate treasurer, Pole, was killed for reproving him. [[Gawain|Sir Gawain]] even adopted the name Dagonet as an ironic alias during one of his adventures.

The [[Knights of the Round Table]] often used Dagonet to play practical jokes on their rivals or their enemies. [[Sir Kay]] arranged for [[Sir Breunor]] to joust with Dagonet at his first tournament, in order to deprive him of the honor of defeating a true knight. On another occasion, Arthur's men pointed out Dagonet to [[Mark of Cornwall|King Mark of Cornwall]] and told him he was Sir Lancelot. The cowardly monarch fled screaming into the forest. Sometimes however, the jester came off a little worse for wear during these episodes. The poor man was beaten by the temporarily insane [[Sir Tristan]] and went mad himself, when his wife was abducted by Helior of the Thorn. Sir Dagonet, however, tracked him down and killed him.

In [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', he is mostly portrayed as a buffoon who has been knighted as a joke, and is defeated by [[Sir Breunor]].

==In later fiction==
*In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', Master Shallow boasts of portraying Sir Dagonet in "Arthur's play". This identifies the character as a buffoon.
*In [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson's]] ''[[Idylls of the King]]'', "Sir" Dagonet appears in "The Last Tournament". The jester is the only one of the court who could foresee the coming doom of the kingdom. He mocks the faithless knights who have broken their vows, and declares that although he and Arthur could hear the music of God's plan, they can not.
*In [[Howard Pyle]]'s ''[[The Story of the Champions of the Round Table]]'', Sir Dagonet, called Arthur's [[Jester|fool]], is dim-witted yet noted for his knightly deeds. He bears the [[heraldry|heraldic]] device of a [[rooster|cockerel]]'s head.
*In the 2004 film ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', the character, portrayed by [[Ray Stevenson]], is depicted as a brave, self-sacrificing warrior whose actions save the rest of Arthur's knights.

The '''decolonization of Africa''' took place in the mid-to-late 1950s, very suddenly {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}, with little preparation {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}. There was widespread unrest and organised revolts in both Northern and sub-Saharan colonies, especially in [[Algerian War|French Algeria]], [[Angolan War of Independence|Portuguese Angola]], [[Congo Crisis|the Belgian Congo]] and [[Mau Mau Uprising|British Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;John Hatch, ''Africa: The Rebirth of Self-Rule'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Roger Louis, ''The transfer of power in Africa: decolonization, 1940-1960'' (Yale UP, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Birmingham|first=David|year=1995|title=The Decolonization of Africa|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-85728-540-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John D.

The "[[Scramble for Africa]]" between 1870 and 1900 ended with almost all of Africa being controlled by European states. Racing to secure as much land as possible while avoiding conflict amongst themselves, the partition of Africa was confirmed in the [[Berlin Conference|Berlin Agreement]] of 1885, with little regard to local differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Berlin Conference of 1884-1885|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195337709.001.0001/acref-9780195337709-e-0467|website=www.oxfordreference.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Berlin Conference|url=http://teacherweb.ftl.pinecrest.edu/snyderd/MWH/Projects/mun-bc/History.htm|website=teacherweb.ftl.pinecrest.edu|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1905, control of almost all African soil was claimed by Western European governments, with the only exceptions being [[Liberia]] (which had been settled by African-American former slaves) and [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] (which had successfully [[First Italo-Ethiopian War|resisted colonisation by Italy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Alistair|title=Countries in Africa Considered Never Colonized|url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/eracolonialism/tp/AfricaNotColon.htm|website=africanhistory.about.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] had the largest holdings, but [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], [[Belgium]], and [[History of Portugal (1834-1910)|Portugal]] also had colonies. As a result of [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]], a majority of Africa lost sovereignty and control of natural resources such as gold and rubber. The introduction of imperial policies surfacing around local economies led to the failing of local economies due to an exploitation of resources and cheap labor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780199371020|location=New York|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progress towards independence was slow up until the mid-20th century. By 1977, 54 African countries had seceded from European colonial rulers.&lt;ref name="selfstudyhistory.com"&gt;[https://selfstudyhistory.com/2015/01/25/decolonisation-of-africa/], DECOLONISATION OF AFRICA.

==Causes==

===External causes===
During the world wars, African soldiers were conscripted into imperial militaries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-five/10542773/non-european-involvement-war.html], The call of the Empire, the call of the war - Telegraph.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a deeper political awareness and the expectation of greater respect and self-determination, which was left largely unfulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Ed, and A. Adu Boahen. (1990). African Perspectives On Colonialism. The International Journal Of African Historical Studies 23 (2): 334. doi:10.2307/219358.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1941 Atlantic Conference, the British and the US leaders met to discuss ideas for the post-war world. One of the provisions added by President Roosevelt was that all people had the right to self-determination, inspiring hope in British colonies.&lt;ref name="selfstudyhistory.com"/&gt;

On February&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;1941, United States President [[Franklin&amp;nbsp;D. Roosevelt]] and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] met to discuss the postwar world. The result was the [[Atlantic Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Atlantic Conference &amp; Charter, 1941|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/atlantic-conf|website=history.state.gov|quote="The Atlantic Charter was a joint declaration released by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on August 14, 1941 following a meeting of the two heads of state in Newfoundland."|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not a treaty and was not submitted to the [[British Parliament]] or the [[Senate of the United States]] for ratification, but it turned to be a widely acclaimed document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karski|first1=Jan|title=The Great Powers and Poland: From Versailles to Yalta|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442226654|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zelAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA330|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the provisions, introduced by Roosevelt, was the autonomy of imperial colonies. After World War II, the US and the African colonies put pressure on Britain to abide by the terms of the Atlantic Charter. After the war, some Britons considered African colonies to be childish and immature; British colonisers introduced democratic government at local levels in the colonies. Britain was forced to agree but Churchill rejected universal applicability of self-determination for subject nations. He also stated that the Charter was only applicable to German occupied states, not to the British Empire.&lt;ref name="selfstudyhistory.com"/&gt;

Furthermore, colonies such as Nigeria, Senegal and Ghana pushed for self-governance as colonial powers were exhausted by war efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, O. (2006). A History of Africa. Volume 2. Kampala East Africa Education Publisher ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal causes===
For early African nationalists, decolonization was a moral imperative. In 1945 the [[Fifth Pan-African Congress]] demanded the end of colonialism. Delegates included future presidents of Ghana, Kenya, [[Malawi]] and national activists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-2010/‘wind-change’-transformed-continent], A ‘Wind Of Change’ That Transformed The Continent | Africa Renewal Online. 2017.

Colonial economic exploitation led to European extraction of Ghana’s mining profits to shareholders, instead of internal development, causing major local socioeconomic grievances.&lt;ref&gt;[Boahen, A. (1990) Africa Under Colonial Domination, Volume 7]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, local African industry and towns expanded when U-boats patrolling the Atlantic Ocean reduced raw material transportation to Europe.&lt;ref name="selfstudyhistory.com"/&gt; In turn, urban communities, industries and trade unions grew, improving literacy and education, leading to pro-independence newspaper establishments.&lt;ref name="selfstudyhistory.com"/&gt;

Indeed, in the 1930s, the colonial powers had cultivated, sometimes inadvertently, a small elite of leaders educated in Western universities and familiar with ideas such as [[self-determination]]. In some cases where the road to independence was fought, settled arrangements with the colonial powers were also being placed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These leaders came to lead the struggles for independence, and included leading [[African nationalism|nationalists]] such as [[Jomo Kenyatta]] ([[Kenya]]), [[Kwame Nkrumah]] ([[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], now [[Ghana]]), [[Julius Nyerere]] ([[Tanganyika]], now [[Tanzania]]), [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] ([[Senegal]]), [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] ([[Nigeria]]), and [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] ([[Côte d'Ivoire]]).{{citation needed|reason=No citation for claim.|date=January 2015}}

==Economic legacy==
The economic legacy of colonialism is difficult to quantify but is likely to have been negative. [[Modernisation theory]] emphasises that colonial powers built infrastructure to integrate Africa into the [[world economy]], however, this was built mainly for extraction purposes. African economies were structured to benefit the coloniser and any surplus was likely to be ‘drained’, thereby stifling [[capital accumulation]].&lt;ref name="Bertocchia, G. 2002"&gt;Bertocchia, G. &amp; Canova, F., (2002) Did colonization matter for growth? An empirical exploration into the historical causes of Africa's underdevelopment. European Economic Review, Volume 46, pp. 1851-1871&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dependency theory]] suggests that most African economies continued to occupy a subordinate position in the world economy after independence with a reliance on primary commodities such as copper in [[Zambia]] and tea in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Ferraro, "Dependency Theory: An Introduction," in The Development Economics Reader, ed. Giorgio Secondi (London: Routledge, 2008), pp. 58-64&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this continued reliance and unfair trading terms, a [[meta-analysis]] of 18 African countries found that a third of countries experienced increased economic growth post-independence.&lt;ref name="Bertocchia, G. 2002"/&gt;

=== Effects of debt ===
The debts of African economies are external and one-sided. While the USA and the UK have gross [[external debt]]s of 95% and 400% respectively, these debts are balanced by the countries being major lenders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/15/developing-world-of-debt] The Guardian, (2012) A developing world of debt.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the case for African nations which do not own as many [[assets]] or debts to balance the burden. The debt situation in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] means that the world’s poorest countries were transferring $3 billion US dollars to developed countries between 1995 and 2000.&lt;ref name="Fole, A. G. 2003 pp. 59-89"&gt;Fole, A. G.,( 2003). The Historical Origin of African Debt Crisis. Eastern Africa Social Science Research Review, 19(1), pp. 59-89&lt;/ref&gt; This is exacerbated by interest and principal arrears which made up over 27% of total external debt for sub-Saharan nations in 1998.&lt;ref name="Fole, A. G. 2003 pp. 59-89"/&gt; This causes two main problems: firstly, servicing the debt means less money is available for importing goods, secondly debt creates uncertainty and risk which puts off investors and reduces business confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Geda, A., (2002). Debt Issues in Africa: Thinking beyond the HIPC Initiative to Solving Structural Problems. UNU/WIDER development conference on Debt Relief, Helsinki, 17–18 August 2001, Volume 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social legacy==

===Language===
Over 2,000 distinct languages are spoken in the continent. Along with Africa’s indigenous dialects - [[Afro-Asiatic]], [[Kordofanian]] and [[Khoisan languages]], many colonial languages are spoken today. For example, English is spoken in [[Ghana]], Gambia and Kenya, French in Benin, Burkina-Faso and Cameroon, and Portuguese in Guinea-Bissau, Angola, São Tomé and Príncipe.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, Jason (2010). Death at birth: The political, economic and social impact of the decolonization and perpetual, neo-colonial control of Congo.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars including Dellal (2013), Miraftab (2012) and Bamgbose (2011) have argued that Africa’s linguistic diversity has been eroded. Language has been used by western colonial powers to divide territories and create new identities which has led to conflicts and tensions between African nations.&lt;ref&gt;IMF Country Report No. 17/80 (2017). Article Iv Consultation - Press Release; Staff Report; And Statement By The Executive Director For Nigeria.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Land ===
Today, 93% of [[South Africa|South Africa's]] land is still owned by ‘descendants of white settlers’ despite the political negotiation of the [[Natives Land Act, 1913|Native Land Act]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Talton, Benjamin (2011). The Challenge of Decolonization in Africa; African &amp; African Diasporan Transformations in the 20th Century&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=January 2018}} King (1990) argued that ‘space’ is a mode of segregations, creating forms of inclusions and exclusions. Evidence is represented through different architecture designs, and distinct segregation of spaces ([[Zoning|Zonification]]) in cities are still a feature in the colonial present. For example, the new development of the business improvement district in Cape Town portrays a similar image of the colonial era with embedded struggles in class, race, ethnicity and hierarchical differences.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwe, Uka (1993). The African debt crisis and the challenge of development.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Decolonization]] marks one of the historical moments in which African countries increased its autonomous status from the impetus Western colonial powers. Echoes of the colonial past are still visible in the African society today because Ferguson (2006) stated there are still widespread social stigmas associated with the continent such as phrases of ‘darkness’ and ‘troubled’. The representation of Africa, therefore, reveals the continual Western legacies of the colonial past and the struggles embedded in the countries.

==Transition to independence==
Following World War II, rapid decolonization swept across the continent of Africa as many territories gained their independence from European colonization.

In August 1941, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met to discuss their post-war goals. In that meeting, they agreed to the Atlantic Charter, which in part stipulated that they would, "respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them."&lt;ref&gt;"Atlantic Charter", August 14, 1941, https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_16912.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement became the post-WWII stepping stone toward independence as nationalism grew throughout Africa.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Consumed with post-war debt, European powers were no longer able to afford the resources needed to maintain control of their African colonies. This allowed for African nationalists to negotiate decolonization very quickly and with minimal casualties. Some territories, however, saw great death tolls as a result of their fight for independence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Ghana independence===
On 6 March 1957, Ghana (formerly the Gold Coast) became the first sub-Saharan African country to gain its independence from European colonization in the twentieth century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Starting as early as the 1945 Pan-African Congress, Gold Coast’s American-educated, independence leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] made his focus clear.  In the conference’s declaration, he wrote, “we believe in the rights of all peoples to govern themselves. We affirm the right of all colonial peoples to control their own destiny. All colonies must be free from foreign imperialist control, whether political or economic.”&lt;ref&gt;Nkrumah, Kwame, ''Fifth Pan-African Congress, Declaration to Colonial People of the World'' (Manchester, England, 1945).&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later in 1949, the conflict would ramp up when British troops opened fire on African protesters.  Riots broke out across the territory and while Nkrumah and other leaders ended up in prison, the event became a catalyst for the independence movement.  After being released from prison, Nkrumah founded the, [[Convention People's Party|Convention People’s Party (CPP)]], which launched a mass-based campaign for independence with the slogan ‘Self Government Now!’”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/media-center/features/2888-political-party-activity-in-ghana-1947-to-1957|title=POLITICAL PARTY ACTIVITY IN GHANA—1947 TO 1957 - Government of Ghana|website=www.ghana.gov.gh|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heightened nationalism within the country grew their power and the political party widely expanded.  In February of 1951, the [[Convention People's Party]] gained political power by winning 34 of 38 elected seats, including one for Nkrumah who was imprisoned at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71210556|title=A history of Africa|last=Assa.|first=Okoth,|date=2006|publisher=East African Educational Publishers|isbn=9789966253576|location=Nairobi|oclc=71210556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the movement started with violence, it would end with political cooperation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Algerian War for Independence ===
In Algeria, anti-colonialism sentiment grew following World War II until it reached a boiling point. Unlike many territories that gained their independence through a smooth transition, France believed the African colony was important and never met their promise of self-governance in Algeria.  As a result the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN)]] began a guerrilla-style attack to win their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/179105303|title=The modern world|date=2008|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|others=Takács, Sarolta A.|isbn=9780765680969|location=Armonk, N.Y.|oclc=179105303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasting more than eight years, the estimated death toll typically falls between 300,000 and 400,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.rfi.fr/africa/20120705-algeria-celebrates-50-years-independence-france-keeps-mum|title=Algeria celebrates 50 years of independence - France keeps mum|date=2012-07-05|work=RFI|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1958, the FLN was able to negotiate peace accord with French President Charles de Gaulle and nearly 90% of all Europeans had left the territory.

The '''''Elevador da Ribeira''''' or '''''Elevador da Lada''''' is a public elevator in [[Porto]], [[Portugal]]. It connects the neighbourhood of {{ill|Ribeira (Porto)|pt|lt=Ribeira}} (at no. 66 of Largo dos Arcos da Ribeira, near the [[Dom Luís I Bridge]])&lt;ref name="visitporto"/&gt; to the middle of the slope of Barredo, by means of a vertical lift and a footbridge.&lt;ref name="elevare"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vasconcelos |first1=António |title=Ascensor da Ribeira do Porto |url=http://www.elevare.pt/PDF/ele6/ah6.pdf |website=elevare |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20180509080728/http://www.elevare.pt/PDF/ele6/ah6.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2018 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed by the architect António Moura, and its inauguration on 13 April 1994 was attended by President [[Mário Soares]] and other dignitaries.&lt;ref name="elevare"/&gt;

The lift is open from Monday to Friday from 08:00 to 20:00.&lt;ref name="visitporto"&gt;{{cite web |title=View point – Lada Elevator (Ribeira) |url=http://www.visitporto.travel/visitar/paginas/viagem/DetalhesPOI.aspx?POI=1731 |website=Visit Porto |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20180629200927/http://www.visitporto.travel/visitar/paginas/viagem/DetalhesPOI.aspx?POI=1731 |archivedate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federation of Danish Motorists''' (Danish: '''Forenede Danske Motorejere''', abbreviated '''FDM''') is an organisation created in 1909 as a spin-off from the Danish automotive interests magazine ''Motor'' (Danish for ''Engine''), which was published since 1906. With the exception of 2009, FDM has had a rising number of members since its creation, and in 2010 had 238,000 members.

The organisation offers both technical and legal assistance and advice to its members, and has taken several legal cases to court on behalf of its members, covering seat malfunctions, parking fines and used car sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Slidte bilsæder udløser erstatning | date = 2010-12-27 | url = http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/article4416502.ece | work = [[Jyllands-Posten]] | accessdate = 2012-11-01 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Principiel sag om p-bøder er for retten | date = 2012-06-04 | url = http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/trafik/article2794560.ece | work = [[Jyllands-Posten]] | accessdate = 2012-11-01 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Højesteret skal afgøre bilers alder | date = 2012-09-05 | url = http://jyllands-posten.dk/motor/article4830531.ece | work = [[Jyllands-Posten]] | accessdate = 2012-11-01 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag Drenthe.svg|thumb|200px|The flag of Drenthe]]

The '''[[flag]] of [[Drenthe]]''' was adopted on February 19, 1947. 

The colours of the flag (red and white) are the traditional [[Saxony|Saxon]] colours and also those of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht|Archbishop of Utrecht]] by whom Drenthe was governed in the past.

The six stars represent the six ancient regions (dingspil) and the castle is a reference to the city [[Coevorden]] from where the province has been governed for a long time.

The [[Western Union (alliance)|Western Union]] (WU) was a military alliance established between France, the United Kingdom and the three Benelux countries between 1948 and 1954. The '''flag of the Western Union''', also referred to as the '''Western Union Standard''', displays an unbroken chain of five rectangular links Or in the shape of an upside-down pentagon on a blue field, with a multicoloured border (red on the outside, gold, black and white) taken from the WU member states' flags.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/eu%5Eweu.html#1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Title: Flags of the World Medium: book Main author(s): H.

==Design==
The flag displays an unbroken chain of five rectangular links Or in the shape of an upside-down pentagon on a blue field, with a multicoloured border (red on the outside, gold, black and white) taken from the WU member states' flags. The relative proportions of the border are approximatively: Red 3, each of the others 1. The total width of the border is approximatively half that of the depth of the flag.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/eu%5Eweu.html#1949&lt;/ref&gt; The number of links symbolises the Western Union's five members.&lt;ref&gt;Title: Flags of the World Medium: book Main author(s): H.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = [The badge of the Headquarters, Western Europe, Commanders-in-Chief] may well be regarded as the first truly international Formation Sign/Badge although the badge of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) was worn during the [[World War II|war]] (1944-46) by British, American and other allied officers, as were also the badges of [[Allied Force Headquarters]] (AFHQ) in North Africa and Italy, and [[South East Asia Command|Supreme Allied Command South-East Asia]] (SACSEA; the H.Q. Staff of Admiral Lord [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]]). This badge is universally worn by the joint staff of the five [[Western Union]] Powers of the [[Treaty of Brussels|Brussels Treaty]] (Britain, France, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg).

The badge, in which the five gold links forming a pentagon on a blue background symbolize the five Western Powers, is worn on did sleeve below the shoulder tide in the same position as all British Formation.

The badge was first seen (in [[Aldershot]]) in October, 1949, worn by Field-Marshal Viscount [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]] when he visited the H.Q. of the Airborne Forces.

==History==
[[File:Western Union Standard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] of the Corps of the [[Royal Military Police]] displaying the flag]]
{{History of the European Union}}
The flag was first seen in October 1949. The flag might also have been introduced and used as a command flag of Commander in Chief Admiral of the Fleet [[Rhoderick McGrigor]] during [[Exercise Verity]] in 1949, the only major exercise held by the organisation. The flag was also flown on a car belonging to [[Bernard Montgomery]], Chairman of the [[Western Union (alliance)#Commanders-in-Chief Committee|Commanders-in-Chief Committee]].

A photo of the flag is shown in the book entitled ''Badges on Battledress'' by [[Howard N. Cole]] (Aldershot, Gale &amp; Polden, 1953). The original caption states: 'NCOs of the Corps of Royal Military Police displaying the Western Union Standard which incorporates the badge of the Headquarters, Western Europe Commanders-in-Chief'. It doesn't say where the photo is taken, although it might just be [[Fontainebleau]].

===Modification===
The flag ceased to be used upon the creation of [[NATO]]'s [[Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum|Headquarters, Allied Land Forces Central Europe]] (AFCENT) in August 1953, at which point one extra link was added to the emblem, symbolising the United States. Similar to the Western Union, AFCENT was based in [[Fontainebleau]], France. AFCENT was later developed into [[Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum]] (JFCBS).

After Normandy was lost by the kings of England in the 13th century, and the ducal title surrendered to France, Jersey and the other [[Channel Islands]] remained attached to the English crown.

The [[bailiwick]] consists of the island of Jersey, the largest of the [[Channel Islands]], along with surrounding uninhabited islands and rocks collectively named [[Les Dirouilles]], [[Écréhous|Les Écréhous]], [[Minquiers|Les Minquiers]], [[Pierres de Lecq|Les Pierres de Lecq]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Les Pierres de Lecq (the Paternosters), Jersey Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar) |publisher=Protected Planet |url=http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Les_Pierres_De_Lecq_The_Paternosters_Jersey_Wetlands_Of_International_Importance_Ramsar/species |accessdate=8 July 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other reefs. Although the bailiwicks of Jersey and [[Guernsey]] are often referred to collectively as the Channel Islands, the "Channel Islands" are not a constitutional or political unit.

==Toponymy==
{{main|Name of Jersey}}

===Origin of the name===

The [[Channel Islands]] are mentioned in the [[Antonine Itinerary]] as the following: ''Sarnia'', ''Caesarea'', ''Barsa'', ''Silia'' and ''Andium'', but Jersey cannot be identified specifically because none corresponds directly to the present names.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Fournier, ''Wikimanche''.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Caesarea'' has been used as the Latin name for Jersey (also in its French version ''Césarée'') since [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'',&lt;ref name=Balleine /&gt; and is used in titles of associations and institutions today. The Latin name ''Caesarea'' was also applied to the colony of [[New Jersey]] as ''Nova Caesarea''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/nj01.asp |title=The Duke of York's Release to John Lord Berkeley, and Sir George Carteret, 24th of June, 1664 |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westjersey.org/wjh_nova.htm |title=So what's all this stuff about Nova Caesarea?? |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Andium'', ''Agna'' and ''Augia'' were used in antiquity.

Scholars variously surmise that ''Jersey'' and ''Jèrri'' derive from ''jarð'' (Old Norse for "earth") or ''[[Earl|jarl]]'' (earl), or perhaps a personal name, ''Geirr'' ("Geirr's Island").&lt;ref&gt;"Jersey", ''Concise Dictionary of World Place-Names''.

[[File:Assize d'Heritage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|An 1893 painting of the ''Assize d'Heritage'' by [[John St Helier Lander]].]]
Jersey history is influenced by its strategic location between the northern coast of France and the southern coast of England; the island's recorded history extends over a thousand years.

[[La Cotte de St Brelade]] is a Palaeolithic site inhabited before rising sea levels transformed Jersey into an island. Jersey was a centre of Neolithic activity, as demonstrated by the concentration of [[Jersey Dolmens|dolmens]]. Evidence of [[Bronze Age]] and early [[Iron Age]] settlements can be found in many locations around the island. In June 2012 it was announced what could be Europe's largest [[Grouville Hoard|hoard]] of Iron Age coins had been found in [[Grouville]] by two persons using [[metal detectors]]. The hoard may be worth up to £10 M. People had been searching for this treasure for 30 years. It was reported that the hoard weighed about three quarters of a tonne and could contain up to 50,000 [[Roman currency|Roman]] and [[Celtic coinage|Celtic coins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-18579875|title=Jersey pair in 30-year search for Iron Age coins|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the same two men had found 60 Iron Age coins in the same area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-16908068|title=Jersey pair find more than 60 Iron Age coins|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|date=6 February 2012|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional [[archaeological]] evidence of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] influence has been found, in particular at [[Les Landes]], the coastal headland site at [[Le Pinacle]], where remains of a primitive structure are attributed to Gallo-Roman temple worship (''[[fanum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Countryside Character Appraisal – Character Area A1: North Coast Heathland |publisher=[[States of Jersey]] |url=http://www.gov.je/PlanningEnvironment/Planning/Island+Plan+and+Other+Policy+Guidance/Countryside+Character+Appraisal/Character+Area+A1+North+Coast+Heathland.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319015642/http://www.gov.je/PlanningEnvironment/Planning/Island%2BPlan%2Band%2BOther%2BPolicy%2BGuidance/Countryside%2BCharacter%2BAppraisal/Character%2BArea%2BA1%2BNorth%2BCoast%2BHeathland.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 March 2016 |accessdate=6 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jersey was part of [[Neustria]] with the same Gallo-Frankish population as the continental mainland. Jersey, the whole Channel Islands and the [[Cotentin peninsula]] (probably with the [[Avranchin]]) came formerly under the control of the duke of [[Brittany]] during the [[Viking]] invasions, because the king of the Franks was unable to defend them, however they remained in the [[archbishopric of Rouen]]. Jersey was invaded by Vikings in the 9th century. In 933 it was annexed to the future [[Duchy of Normandy]], together with the other Channel Islands, Cotentin and Avranchin, by [[William I of Normandy|William Longsword]], [[count of Rouen]] and it became one of the Norman Islands. When William's descendant, [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], [[Norman conquest of England|conquered England]] in 1066, the Duchy of Normandy and the kingdom of England were governed under one monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Short Constitutional History of Jersey|publisher=Voisin &amp; Co.|date=18 May 1999|url=http://www.voisinlaw.com/pg368.htm|accessdate=7 October 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826101652/http://www.voisinlaw.com/pg368.htm |archivedate=26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dukes of Normandy owned considerable estates in the island, and Norman families living on their estates established many of the historical Norman-French Jersey family names. [[John, King of England|King John]] lost all his territories in mainland Normandy in 1204 to [[Philip II of France|King Philip II Augustus]], but retained possession of Jersey and the other Channel Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Liddicoat | first = Anthony | title = A Grammar of the Norman French of the Channel Islands | publisher = [[Walter de Gruyter]] | date = 1 August 1994 | page = 6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pgobrmlMAGQC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6 | isbn = 3-11-012631-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] (1259), the English king formally surrendered his claim to the duchy of Normandy and ducal title, and since then the islands have been internally self-governing territories of the English crown and latterly the British crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liddicoat |first=Anthony |title=A Grammar of the Norman French of the Channel Islands |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |date=1 August 1994|page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pgobrmlMAGQC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6 |isbn=3-11-012631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 1406, 1,000 French men at arms led by [[Pero Niño]] invaded Jersey, landing at St Aubin's Bay and defeated the 3,000 defenders but failed to capture the island.&lt;ref name="BHJ"&gt;{{cite book|last=Syvret|first=Marguerite|title=Balleine's History of Jersey|publisher=The History Press|ISBN=978-1860776502}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50–1}}

Aware of the military importance of Jersey, the British government had ordered that the island be heavily fortified. On 6 January 1781, a French invasion force of 2,000 men set out to take over the island, but only half of the force arrived and landed. The [[Battle of Jersey]] lasted about half an hour, with English successfully defending the island. There were about thirty casualties on each side, and the English took 600 French prisoners who were subsequently sent to England. The French commanders were slain.

Trade laid the foundations of prosperity, aided by neutrality between England and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ommer |first=Rosemary E. |title=From Outpost to Outport |publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]] |year=1991 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nrdYUXv817sC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12 |isbn=0-7735-0730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jersey way of life involved agriculture, [[Windmills in the Channel Islands|milling]], fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and production of woollen goods. 19th-century improvements in transport links brought tourism to the island.

During the [[Second World War]], some citizens were evacuated to the UK but most remained. Jersey was [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|occupied by Germany]] from 1 July 1940 until 9 May 1945, when Germany surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bellows |first=Tony |title=What was the "Occupation" and why is "Liberation Day" celebrated in the Channel Islands? |publisher=[[Société Jersiaise]] |url=http://members.societe-jersiaise.org/whitsco/jerrais1.htm |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the Germans constructed many fortifications using [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] slave labour. After 1944, supplies from mainland France were interrupted by the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]], and food on the island became scarce. The SS ''[[SS Vega (1913)|Vega]]'' was sent to the island carrying [[Red Cross]] supplies and news of the success of the Allied advance in Europe. The Channel Islands were one of the last places in Europe to be liberated. 9 May is celebrated as the island's [[Liberation Day (Channel Islands)|Liberation Day]], where there are celebrations in [https://www.google.je/maps/place/49%C2%B010'57.7%22N+2%C2%B006'32.9%22W/@49.182687,-2.1096862,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d49.1826872!4d-2.1091389?

===Legal system===

Jersey is a distinct [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] for the purposes of [[conflict of laws]], separate from the other Channel Islands, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Jersey law has been influenced by several different legal traditions, in particular [[Norman law|Norman customary law]], [[English common law#Common law|English common law]] and modern [[French civil law]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;See generally {{cite book|author=S Nicolle|title=The Origin and Development of Jersey law: an Outline Guide|edition=5th|location=St Helier|publisher=Jersey and Guernsey Law Review|year=2009|ISBN=978-0-9557611-3-3}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |publisher=Institute of Law |location=Jersey |title=Study Guide on Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104105/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |archivedate=28 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jersey's [[List of country legal systems|legal system]] is therefore described as 'mixed' or '[[Legal pluralism|pluralistic]]', and sources of law are in French and English languages, although since the 1950s the main [[working language]] of the legal system is English.

The principal court is the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]], with appeals to the [[Jersey Court of Appeal]] and, ultimately, to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. The [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)|Bailiff]] is head of the judiciary; the Bailiff and the Deputy Bailiff are [[Law of Jersey#Judiciary|appointed]] by the Crown. Other members of the island's [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|judiciary]] are [[Law of Jersey#Judiciary|appointed]] by the Bailiff.

===Parishes===
{{main|Parishes of Jersey}}
[[File:Jersey Map.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.8|The parishes of Jersey]]
Administratively, Jersey is divided into 12 [[Parishes of Jersey|parishes]]. All border on the sea. They were named after the Christian [[saint]]s to whom their ancient [[parish church]]es were dedicated:

{{columns-list|colwidth=33em|
*[[Grouville]] (historically ''Saint Martin de Grouville''; incorporating [[Minquiers|Les Minquiers]])
*[[Saint Brélade]]
*[[Saint Clement, Jersey|Saint Clément]]
*[[Saint Helier]]
*[[Saint John, Jersey|Saint John]]
*[[Saint Lawrence, Jersey|Saint Lawrence]]
*[[Saint Martin, Jersey|Saint Martin]] (historically ''Saint Martin le Vieux''; incorporating [[Écréhous|Les Écréhous]])
*[[Saint Mary, Jersey|Saint Mary]]
*[[Saint Ouen, Jersey|Saint Ouen]]
*[[Saint Peter, Jersey|Saint Peter]]
*[[Saint Saviour, Jersey|Saint Saviour]]
*[[Trinity, Jersey|Trinity]]
}}
The parishes of Jersey are further divided into ''[[vingtaine]]s'' (or, in St. Ouen, ''cueillettes''), divisions that are historic. Today they are used chiefly for purposes of local administration and electoral constituency.

The [[Connétable (Jersey and Guernsey)|Connétable]] is the head of each parish, elected at a public election for a four-year term to run the parish and to represent the municipality in the Assembly of the [[States of Jersey]]. The [[Procureur du Bien Public]] (two in each parish) is the legal and financial representative of the parish (elected at a public election since 2003 in accordance with the ''Public Elections (Amendment) (Jersey) Law 2003''; formerly an Assembly of Electors of each parish elected the Procureurs in accordance with the ''Loi (1804) au sujet des assemblées paroissiales''). A Procureur du Bien Public is elected for three years as a public trustee for the funds and property of the parish and may contract when authorised by a Parish Assembly. The [[Parish Assembly (Jersey)|Parish Assembly]] is the decision-making body of local government in each parish; it consists of all entitled voters of the parish.

Each parish elects its own force of [[Honorary Police]] consisting of ''[[Centenier]]s'', ''[[Vingtenier]]s'' and [[Constable's Officer]]s. Centeniers are elected at a public election within each parish for a term of three years to undertake policing within the parish. The Centenier is the only officer authorised to charge and bail offenders. Formerly, the senior Centenier of each parish (entitled the ''Chef de Police'') deputised for the Connétable in the States of Jersey when the Connétable was unable to attend a sitting of the States. This function has now been abolished.

===International relations===
{{main|External relations of Jersey}}
[[File:Jersey Airport signage in Jèrriais.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|[[Jersey Airport]] greets travellers with "Welcome to Jersey" sign in [[Jèrriais]].]]
Although diplomatic representation is reserved to the Crown, Jersey has been developing its own international identity over recent years. It negotiates directly with foreign governments on matters within the competence of the States of Jersey. Jersey maintains the ''Bureau des Iles Anglo-Normandes'' in [[Caen]], France, a permanent non-diplomatic representation. A similar office, the ''Maison de Normandie'' in St. Helier, represents the ''[[Conseil général]]'' of [[Manche]] and the ''[[Regional Council (France)|Regional Council]]'' of [[Normandy]]. It also houses the Consulate of France. In July 2009, a [[Channel Islands Tunnel]] was proposed to connect Jersey with [[Lower Normandy]].&lt;ref name="bbcnews"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/jersey/8149314.stm | title=Jersey-France tunnel plan talks | publisher=BBC News | date=14 July 2009 | accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jersey is a member of the [[British-Irish Council]], the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]] and the [[Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie]]. Jersey wants to become a full member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;''Jersey Evening Post'', 23 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====International identity====
In 2007, the [[Chief Minister of Jersey|Chief Minister]] and the UK [[Lord Chancellor]] signed an agreement&lt;ref name="gov.je"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20InternationalIdentityFramework%2020070502.pdf |title=Framework for developing the international identity of Jersey |format=PDF |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that established a framework for the development of the international identity of Jersey.

In January 2011, the Chief Minister designated one of his assistant ministers as having responsibility for external relations; he is now often described as the island's 'foreign minister'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/01/14/meet-our-new-foreign-minister/ |title=Meet our new foreign minister « This Is Jersey |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |accessdate=12 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117055756/http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/01/14/meet-our-new-foreign-minister/ |archivedate=17 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/01/17/a-new-role-of-great-importance/ |title=A new role of great importance |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122210938/http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/01/17/a-new-role-of-great-importance/ |archivedate=22 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tax information exchange agreements]] (TIEAs) have been signed directly by the island with several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TAX INFORMATION EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS (TIEAs)|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Tax%20and%20your%20money/ID%20TIEAsSignedToDate.pdf|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship with the European Union====
{{See also|Special member state territories and the European Union}}
Jersey is neither a Member State nor an [[European Union Association Agreement|Associate Member]] of the [[European Union]]. It does, however, have a relationship with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK's Treaty of Accession in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], Article 355(5)(c) TFEU states "the Treaties shall apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man only to the extent necessary to ensure the implementation of the arrangements for those islands set out in the Treaty concerning the accession of new Member States to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community signed on 22 January 1972".&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jersey does not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This is a result of the manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like [[Gibraltar]], being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that is limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.

Under Protocol 3, Jersey is part of the [[European Union Customs Union]] of the [[European Community]]. The common customs tariff, levies and other agricultural import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is [[Internal Market (European Union)#Free movement of goods|free movement of goods]] and trade between the island and [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]. EU rules on [[freedom of movement for workers]] do not apply in Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996J0171:EN:HTML |title='&amp;#39;Rui Alberto Pereira Roque v His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey'&amp;#39;, Case C-171/96 (European Court of Justice) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that the scope of this article included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The German blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive|financial services]]. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135&amp;nbsp;km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'') labelling the island a [[tax haven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sesit|first1=M|title=Offshore Hazard: Isle of Jersey Proves Less Than a Haven to Currency Investors|agency=The Wall Street Journal|date=17 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British citizens who have only a connection to Jersey, and not with the United Kingdom or another member state of the European Union, are not considered by the Jersey States to be [[Citizenship of the European Union|European Union citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, it is not yet clear whether the citizenship rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly available to them as British Citizens, given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the Protocol. That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms does not apply to all Community or Union rights. The freedom of movement under the prior EC régime was and remains a separate set of rights from the Citizen rights under article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside. Those rights are primary citizenship rights, not a mere freedom. It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this, merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, and supplementary implementation measures from the Council, given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol. Jersey residents presently do not have a right to vote in elections for the [[European Parliament]]. Jersey and Guernsey jointly opened an office in [[Brussels]] in 2010 to promote their common interests with European Union institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The effect of the UK leaving the European Union is uncertain. The UK have confirmed that the Crown dependencies position will be argued in the [[Brexit negotiations]].

====Separation debate====
{{See also|Devolution in the United Kingdom|European microstates}}
The [[Politics of Jersey#Separation debate|question of an independent Jersey]] has been discussed from time to time in the Assembly of the States of Jersey. In 2005–08, a working group of the [[States of Jersey]] examined the options for independence, concluding that Jersey 'is equipped to face the challenges of independence' but making no recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/documents/reports/46527-24954-2762008.htm |title=Second Interim Report of the Constitution Review Group |publisher=Statesassembly.gov.je |accessdate=31 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511111106/http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/documents/reports/46527-24954-2762008.htm |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals for Jersey independence continue to be discussed outside the States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/09/21/legal-ideas-of-political-importance/ |title=Legal ideas of political importance |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |accessdate=12 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702113346/http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/09/21/legal-ideas-of-political-importance/ |archivedate= 2 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/09/17/sovereignty-or-dependency-on-agenda-at-conference/ |title=Sovereignty or dependency on agenda at conference |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702102302/http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/09/17/sovereignty-or-dependency-on-agenda-at-conference/ |archivedate= 2 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the Council of Ministers issued a "Common policy for external relations"&lt;ref name="External policy" /&gt; which noted "that it is not Government policy to seek independence from the United Kingdom, but rather to ensure that Jersey is prepared if it were in the best interests of islanders to do so". On the basis of the established principles the Council of Ministers decided to "ensure that Jersey is prepared for external change that may affect the island's formal relationship with the United Kingdom and/or European Union".

[[File:Bonne Nuit Bay.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bonne Nuit (Jersey)|Bonne Nuit]] bay]]
[[File:Jersey-islands.png|thumb|right|Map of islands of [[Bailiwick]] of Jersey]]
Jersey is an island measuring {{convert|118.2|km2|mi2}} (or 66,436 [[vergée]]s),&lt;ref name=figures /&gt; including [[Land reclamation|reclaimed]] land and intertidal zone. It lies in the [[English Channel]], about {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|lk=on}} from the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] in [[Normandy]], France, and about {{convert|87|nmi|km mi}} south of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Geographically it is not part of the [[British Isles]]. As of 15 October 2006, the [[States of Jersey]]&lt;!--Website in external links below: [http://www.gov.je/ website]--&gt; indicates that the island is situated "only 22&amp;nbsp;km off the northwest coast of France and 140&amp;nbsp;km south of England".&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest and southernmost of the Channel Islands, with a maximum land elevation of 143&amp;nbsp;m (469&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.

The central two parishes (St.John and St.Lawrence) occupy the centre of the island and offer many direct routes from north to south through a number of valleys including water works valley.

==Climate==

The climate is [[temperate]] with mild winters and mild to warm summers.&lt;ref name="Factbook"&gt;{{cite web |title=CIA – The World Factbook – Jersey |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date=5 October 2006 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/je.html |accessdate=7 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Atlantic Ocean]] has a moderating effect on temperature in Jersey, as water has a much greater specific heat capacity than air and tends to heat and cool slowly throughout the year. This has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer. The highest temperature recorded was 36.0&amp;nbsp;°C (96.8&amp;nbsp;°F) on 9 August 2003, and the lowest temperature recorded was −10.3&amp;nbsp;°C (13.5&amp;nbsp;°F) on 5 January 1894. By comparison, higher temperatures are found in mainland United Kingdom, which achieved 38.5&amp;nbsp;°C (101.3&amp;nbsp;°F) in [[Faversham]], [[Kent]] on 10 August 2003. The impact of the Atlantic Ocean and coastal winds ensure that Jersey is slightly cooler than the southern and central parts of [[England]] during the summer months.
Snow falls rarely in Jersey; some years will pass with no snow fall at all.

The terrain consists of a [[plateau]] sloping from long sandy bays in the south to rugged cliffs in the north. The plateau is cut by valleys running generally north-south.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Jersey}}
Jersey's economy is based on [[financial services]] (40% of [[Gross value added|GVA]] in 2012), tourism and hospitality (hotels, restaurants, bars, transport and communications totalling 8.4% of GVA in 2012), retail and wholesale (7% of GVA in 2012), construction (6.2% of GVA in 2012) and agriculture (1.3% of GVA in 2012).&lt;ref name=figures&gt;{{cite web|title=Jersey in Figures 2013 booklet|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Jersey%20In%20Figures%202013%2020140429%20SU.pdf|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to specialisation in a few high-return sectors, at [[purchasing power parity]] Jersey has high economic output per capita, substantially ahead of all of the world's large developed economies. [[Gross national income]] in 2009 was £3.7 billion (approximately £40,000 per head of population).&lt;ref name=figures /&gt; However, this is not indicative of each individual resident's purchasing power, and the actual standard of living in Jersey is comparable to that in the United Kingdom outside central London. The island is recognised as one of the [[Offshore Financial Centre#List of main offshore financial centres|leading offshore financial centres]]. The growth of this sector however has not been without its controversies as Jersey has been characterised by critics and detractors as a place in which the "leadership has essentially been captured by global finance, and whose members will threaten and intimidate anyone who dissents."&lt;ref name="Shaxson, N. 2011"/&gt;  In June 2005 the States introduced the Competition (Jersey) Law 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcra.je/pdf/051101%20Competition-Jersey-Law--2005.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614080656/http://www.jcra.je/pdf/051101%20Competition-Jersey-Law--2005.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 June 2007 |title=Competition (Jersey) Law 2005 |publisher=Jcra.je |accessdate=16 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to regulate competition and stimulate economic growth. This [[competition law]] was based on that of other jurisdictions.

Tourism supports not only hotels, but also retail and services: in 2015 there were 717,600 visitors spending £243 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.je/Government/JerseyInFigures/BusinessEconomy/Pages/Tourism.aspx|title=Tourism statistics|last=Jersey|first=States of|website=www.gov.je|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duty-free]] goods are available for purchase on travel to and from the island.

[[File:Aerial view of fields in St Clement, Jersey.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of fields in [[Saint Clement, Jersey]]]]
In 2009 57% of the Island's area was agricultural land (an increase on 2008). Major agricultural products are [[potato]]es and dairy produce; agriculture's share of GVA increased 5% in 2009, a fifth successive year of growth.&lt;ref name=figures /&gt; [[Jersey cattle]] are a small breed of cow widely known for its rich milk and cream; the quality of its meat is also appreciated on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Davenport |first=Philippa |title=Jersey's cash cow |work=Financial Times |date=20 May 2006 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/7a7bb3e0-e720-11da-9046-0000779e2340.html |accessdate=7 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Witmer |first=Jason |title=CROPP contracts brings profitability to Ohio grass-based, organic dairies |publisher=The Rodale Institute |date=11 June 2004 |url=http://www.newfarm.org/features/0604/nissley/index.shtml |accessdate=7 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The herd total in 2009 was 5,090 animals.&lt;ref name=figures /&gt; Fisheries and aquaculture make use of Jersey's marine resources to a total value of over £6 million in 2009.&lt;ref name=figures /&gt;

Farmers and growers often sell surplus food and flowers in boxes on the roadside, relying on the honesty of customers to drop the correct change into the money box and take what they want. In the 21st century, diversification of agriculture and amendments in planning strategy have led to farm shops replacing many of the roadside stalls.

53,460 people were employed in Jersey {{as of|2010|December|lc=y}}: 24% in financial and legal services; 16% in wholesale and retail trades; 16% in the public sector; 10% in education, health and other private sector services; 10% in construction and quarrying; 9% in hotels, restaurants and bars.&lt;ref name=figures /&gt;

Jersey along with [[Guernsey]] has its own lottery called the [[Channel Islands Lottery]] that was launched in 1975.

On 18 February 2005, Jersey was granted [[Fairtrade Town|Fairtrade Island]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Island achieves Fairtrade status |publisher=BBC News  |date=24 February 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/jersey/4295551.stm |accessdate=6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
Until the 20th century, the States relied on indirect taxation to finance the administration of Jersey. The levying of ''impôts'' (duties) different from those of the United Kingdom was granted by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing [[income tax]] was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a [[Flat tax|flat rate]] of 20% set by the occupying Germans during the Second World War.

Because [[value added tax]] (VAT) has not been levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, providing an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led to the growth of the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. [[Low-value consignment relief]] provided the mechanism for [[VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands]] to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.

Although Jersey does not have VAT, the States of Jersey introduced a [[Value added tax|goods and services tax]] (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK. Food is not exempt, unlike with VAT.

Jersey is not subject to European Union fiscal legislation, and its "Zero/Ten" corporate tax legislation will be compliant with the Code of Conduct in business taxation as from the removal of the deemed distribution and attribution anti-avoidance legislation {{as of|2011|December|31|lc=y}}, which was apparently criticised by certain unnamed members of the Code of Conduct Group, a subsidiary body of [[ECOFIN]]. The Code of Conduct Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/company_tax/harmful_tax_practices/index_en.htm|title=Harmful tax competition – Taxation and Customs Union – European Commission|website=Taxation and Customs Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least in theory, keeps most of its documentation and discussion confidential. The [[European Commission]] has confirmed that the Code is not a legal instrument, and therefore is not legally binding, only becoming of limited "political" authority once a unanimous report has been adopted by the Group at the end of the Presidency concerned.

Jersey is ranked as a [[tax haven]] by many organisations with the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] ranking Jersey as 16th, one rank behind the United Kingdom {{as of|2015|lc=y}}.

===Currency===

{{main|Jersey pound}}
[[File:Commemorative stamps for Mesny's 150th anniversary 1992.jpg|thumb|lright|Jersey stamps commemorating the 150th anniversary of the birth of General [[William Mesny]]]]
Jersey issues its own [[postage stamps]] and [[Jersey pound|Jersey banknotes and coins]] that circulate with UK coinage, [[Bank of England]] notes, [[British banknotes#Scotland|Scottish notes]] and [[Guernsey pound|Guernsey currency]] within the island. Jersey currency is not [[legal tender]] outside Jersey: However, in the United Kingdom it is ''acceptable tender''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Lords, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo011206/text/11206-28.htm |title=Lords Hansard text for 6 Dec 2001 (211206-28) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=6 December 2001 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be surrendered at banks within that country in exchange for Bank of England-issued currency on a like-for-like basis.

====Coinage====

The main currency of Jersey is the pound, although in many places the euro is accepted because of the location of the island.
Pound coins are issued, but are much less widely used than pound notes. Designs on the reverse of Jersey pound coins include historic ships built in Jersey and a series of the twelve parishes' crests. The [[motto]] around the milled edge of Jersey pound coins is ''{{lang|la|Insula Caesarea}}'' (''Island of Jersey''). Two pound coins are also issued, but in very small quantities.

In July 2014, the Jersey Financial Services Commission approved the establishment of the world's first regulated [[Bitcoin]] fund, at a time when the [[digital currency]] was being accepted by some local businesses.&lt;ref name="BitcoinJersey"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jersey approve Bitcoin fund launch on island|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-28247796|accessdate=10 July 2014|publisher=''BBC news''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

{{main|Demographics of Jersey}}
Censuses have been undertaken in Jersey since 1821. In the 2011 census, the total resident population was estimated to be 97,857, of whom 34% live in [[Saint Helier]], the island's only town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20CensusBulletin1%2020111208%20SU.pdf|title=Jersey Census 2011 Bulletin no 1|publisher=States of Jersey|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately half the island's population was born in Jersey; 31% of the population were born elsewhere in the British Isles, 7% in continental Portugal or Madeira, 8% in other European countries and 4% elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20CensusBulletin2%2020111214%20SU.pdf|title=Jersey Census 2011 Bulletin no 2|publisher=States of Jersey|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people of Jersey are often called Islanders or, in individual terms, Jerseyman or Jerseywoman. Some Jersey-born people identify as British.

===Immigration===
Jersey belongs to the [[Common Travel Area]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/HomeAffairs/CusAndImm/Immigration/ |title=Visas / entry clearances / work permit issue |accessdate=14 September 2009 |work=Home Affairs, Customs &amp; Immigration, Immigration |publisher=States of Jersey |quote=Passengers arriving from outside of the Common Travel Area (United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) will pass through an Immigration control. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010113620/http://www2.gov.je/HomeAffairs/CusAndImm/Immigration/ |archivedate=10 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the definition of "United Kingdom" in the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] is interpreted as including the UK and the Islands together.&lt;ref name="Nationality Act"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1981/cukpga_19810061_en_8#pt5-l1g57 |title=British Nationality Act 1981 |accessdate=14 September 2009 |work=Legislation, UK, Acts |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |quote=the Islands” means the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man; [...] the United Kingdom” means Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Islands, taken together; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001142348/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1981/cukpga_19810061_en_8 |archivedate=1 October 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For immigration and nationality purposes, the United Kingdom generally treats Jersey as though it were part of the UK. Jersey is constitutionally entitled to restrict immigration&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.je/NR/rdonlyres/7AAC2805-37B6-4FC9-BA1A-E8F203D7949C/0/SummaryPolicy.pdf gov.je – Summary Policy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407204016/http://www.gov.je/NR/rdonlyres/7AAC2805-37B6-4FC9-BA1A-E8F203D7949C/0/SummaryPolicy.pdf |date=7 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by non-Jersey residents, but control of immigration at the point
of entry cannot be introduced for British, certain Commonwealth and EEA nationals
without change to existing international law.&lt;ref name="gov.je - Migration Monitoring and Regulation"&gt;[http://www.gov.je/NR/rdonlyres/D332538A-503A-46E6-AA91-3CB7B7B382CB/0/P252005MigrationMonitoringandRegulation.pdf gov.je – Migration Monitoring and Regulation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319021315/http://www.gov.je/NR/rdonlyres/D332538A-503A-46E6-AA91-3CB7B7B382CB/0/P252005MigrationMonitoringandRegulation.pdf |date=19 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration is therefore controlled by a mixture of restrictions on those without ''residential status'' purchasing or renting property in the island and restrictions on employment. Migration policy is to move to a registration system to integrate residential and employment status.&lt;ref name="gov.je - Migration Monitoring and Regulation"/&gt;  Jersey maintains its own immigration&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.je/HomeAffairs/CusAndImm/Immigration/ gov.je – Immigration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319021150/http://www.gov.je/HomeAffairs/CusAndImm/Immigration/ |date=19 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and border controls. United Kingdom immigration legislation may be extended to Jersey by order in council (subject to exceptions and adaptations) following consultation with Jersey and with Jersey's consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Lords, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100118w0003.htm |title=Answer by Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office, (Lord West of Spithead) in UK House of Lords 18 January 2010 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Jersey citizens are full British citizens, an endorsement restricting the right of establishment in European Union states other than the UK is placed in the passports of British citizens connected solely with the Channel Islands and Isle of Man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.je/HomeAffairs/CusAndImm/Passports/holder+is+not+entitled+to+benefit+from+EC+Provisions.htm gov.je – Passports – I have an observation in my passport that says – the holder is not entitled to benefit from EC Provisions relating to employment and settlement – what does that mean?]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319020905/http://www.gov.je/HomeAffairs/CusAndImm/Passports/holder%2Bis%2Bnot%2Bentitled%2Bto%2Bbenefit%2Bfrom%2BEC%2BProvisions.htm |date=19 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have a parent or grandparent born in the United Kingdom, or who have lived in the United Kingdom for five years, are not subject to this restriction.

Historical large-scale immigration was facilitated by the introduction of steamships (from 1823). By 1840, up to 5,000 [[English people]], mostly [[half-pay]] officers and their families, had settled in Jersey.&lt;ref name=Balleine&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marguerite Syvret |author2=Joan Stevens |title=Balleine's History of Jersey|year=1998|publisher=La Société Jersiaise|isbn=1-86077-065-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of 1848, Polish, Russian, [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], Italian and French political refugees came to Jersey. Following [[Napoléon III|Louis Napoléon]]'s coup of 1851, more French ''proscrits'' arrived. By the end of the 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.

Seasonal work in agriculture had depended mostly on [[Breton people|Bretons]] and mainland Normans from the 19th century. The growth of tourism attracted staff from the United Kingdom. Following [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation]] in 1945, agricultural workers were mostly recruited from the United Kingdom – the demands of reconstruction in mainland [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] employed domestic labour.

Until the 1960s, the population had been relatively stable for decades at around 60,000 (excluding the Occupation years). Economic growth spurred immigration and a rise in population, which is, by 2013, about 100,000. From the 1960s [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] workers arrived, mostly working initially in seasonal industries in agriculture and tourism.

Immigration has helped give aspects of Jersey a distinct urban character, particularly in and around the parish of St Helier, which contributes much to ongoing debates between development and sustainability throughout the island.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Henry (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306058256_Encountering_Urbanization_on_Jersey_Development_Sustainability_and_Spatiality_in_a_Small_Island_Setting Encountering Urbanization on Jersey: Development, Sustainability, and Spatiality in a Small Island Setting].

== Religion in Jersey ==
{{main|Religion in Jersey}}
Religion in Jersey has a complex history, drawn largely from different Christian denominations. In 2015, Jersey's first ever national survey of religion found that two fifths of Jersey people have [[irreligion|no religion]], with only small handfuls of Jersey people belonging to the non-Christian religions. In total, 54% said they had some form of religion, and 7% were not sure. Of those that specified a denomination of Christianity, equal proportions were 'Catholic' or 'Roman Catholic' (43%) as were 'Anglican' or 'Church of England' (44%). The remaining eighth (13%) gave another Christian denomination.&lt;ref name=JASS15&gt;{{cite book|title=Jersey Annual Social Survey: 2015|publisher=States of Jersey|page=8|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20JASS%202015%2020151202%20SU.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[established church]] is the [[Church of England]], from 2015 under the See of Canterbury (previously under the Winchester diocese). In the countryside, [[Methodism]] found its traditional stronghold. A substantial minority of [[Catholic Church in Jersey|Roman Catholics]] can also be found in Jersey. There are two Catholic private combined primary and secondary schools: [[De La Salle College, Jersey|De La Salle College]] in [[Saint Saviour, Jersey|Saint Saviour]] is an all-boys school, and Beaulieu Convent School in Saint Saviour is an all-girls school; and [[Faithful Companions of Jesus|FCJ]] primary school in St. Saviour. A Catholic order of Sisters has a presence in school life.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Jersey}}
[[File:La Nethe Rue road sign Jersey.jpg|thumb|Jèrriais road sign ("The black road") in [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|Saint Ouen]].]]
Until the 19th century, indigenous [[Jèrriais]] – a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[Norman language|Norman]] – was the language of the island, though French was used for official business. During the 20th century, [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural influence]] saw an intense [[language shift]] take place and Jersey today is predominantly [[English-speaking world|English-speaking]].&lt;ref name="Facts about Jersey"/&gt; Jèrriais nonetheless survives; around 2,600 islanders (three percent) are reckoned to be habitual speakers, and some 10,000 (12 percent) in all claim some knowledge of the language, particularly amongst the elderly in rural parishes. There have been efforts to revive Jèrriais in schools, and the highest number of declared Jèrriais speakers is in the capital.

[[File:Lillie langtry.JPG|thumb|upright|Actress [[Lillie Langtry]], nicknamed the ''Jersey Lily''.]]
The [[dialect]]s of Jèrriais differ in [[phonology]] and, to a lesser extent, [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] between parishes, with the most marked differences to be heard between those of the west and east. Many place names are in Jèrriais, and French and English place names are also to be found. [[Anglicisation]] of the [[place names]] increased apace with the migration of English people to the island.

Some [[Neolithic]] carvings are the earliest works of artistic character to be found in Jersey. Only fragmentary wall-paintings remain from the rich mediaeval artistic heritage, after the wholesale [[iconoclasm]] of the [[Reformation|Calvinist Reformation]] of the 16th century.

The island is particularly famous for the [[Jersey Battle of Flowers|Battle of Flowers]], a carnival held annually since 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jersey Battle of Flowers |publisher=Jersey Battle of Flowers Association |year=2005 |url=http://www.battleofflowers.com/thebattle/index.htm |accessdate=15 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825021120/http://www.battleofflowers.com/thebattle/index.htm |archivedate=25 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other festivals include ''La Fête dé Noué''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Fête dé Noué |url=http://www.jersey.com/english/sightsandactivities/eventscalendar/christmas/pages/default.aspx |accessdate=18 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222111703/http://www.jersey.com/english/sightsandactivities/eventscalendar/christmas/pages/default.aspx |archivedate=22 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Christmas festival), ''La Faîs'sie d'Cidre'' (cidermaking festival),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Faîs'sie d'Cidre|url=http://jerseyheritage.org/events/la-fa-s-sie-d-cidre|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Battle of Britain]] air display, Jersey Live Music Festival, Branchage Film Festival, food festivals, and parish events.

====Daily newspaper====
Jersey has only one newspaper, the ''[[Jersey Evening Post]]'', which is printed six days a week, and has been in publication since 1890.

===Music===
[[File:Jersey Town Criterium 2011 07.jpg|thumb|The ''Band of the Island of Jersey'' play at many events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Band of the Island of Jersey|url=http://www.islandband.org.je|accessdate=18 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907163918/http://www.islandband.org.je/|archivedate=7 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The traditional [[folk music]] of Jersey was common in country areas until the mid-20th century. It cannot be separated from the musical traditions of continental Europe, and the majority of songs and tunes that have been documented have close parallels or variants, particularly in France. Most of the surviving traditional songs are in French, with a minority in Jèrriais.

In contemporary music, [[Nerina Pallot]] has enjoyed international success. Music festivals include [[Jersey Live]], Jersey Dead, Rock in the Park, Avanchi presents Jazz in July, the music section of the [[Jersey Eisteddfod]] and the Liberation Jersey Music Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberation Jersey Music Festival|url=http://www.liberationjersey.com/|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
In 1909, T. J. West established the first cinema in the Royal Hall in St. Helier, which became known as West's Cinema in 1923 (demolished 1977). The first [[talking picture]], ''The Perfect Alibi'', was shown on 30 December 1929 at the Picture House in St. Helier. The Jersey Film Society was founded on 11 December 1947 at the Café Bleu, West's Cinema. The large Art Deco Forum Cinema was opened in 1935 – during the German occupation this was used for German [[propaganda]] films.

The [[Odeon Cinema]] was opened 2 June 1952 and, was later rebranded in the early 21st century as the Forum cinema. Its owners, however, struggled to meet tough competition from the Cineworld Cinemas group, which opened a 10 screen multiplex on the waterfront centre in St. Helier on reclaimed land in December 2002 and the Odeon closed its doors in late 2008. The Odeon is now a [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Document Reference : HE0024 |url=https://www.mygov.je//Planning/Pages/HistoricEnvironmentDetail.aspx?s=3&amp;r=HE0024|publisher=Mygov.je|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Odeon Cinema Building sold to Freedom Church Jersey|url=http://freedomcentre.je/press-releases/1-former-odeon-cinema-building-to-be-sold-to-freedom-church-jersey.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202041445/http://freedomcentre.je/press-releases/1-former-odeon-cinema-building-to-be-sold-to-freedom-church-jersey.html|archivedate=2 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, [[Kevin C. Lewis|Kevin Lewis]] (formerly of the Cine Centre and the New Forum) has arranged the Jersey Film Festival, a charity event showing the latest and also classic films outdoors in [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] on a big screen. The 2011 festival was held in Howard Davis Park, St Saviour, on the 13–19 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jersey Film Festival|url=http://www.jerseyfilmfestival.com/|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First held in 2008, the [[Branchage|Branchage Jersey International Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Branchage Film Festival|url=http://www.branchagefestival.com/|accessdate=18 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915034127/http://www.branchagefestival.com/|archivedate=15 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; attracts filmmakers from all over the world.

===Food and drink===
[[File:Jersey wonders.jpg|thumb|''Jersey wonders'', or ''mèrvelles'', are a favourite snack consisting of fried dough, found especially at country fêtes. According to tradition, the success of cooking depends on the state of the tide.]]
Seafood has traditionally been important to the cuisine of Jersey: [[mussel]]s (called ''moules'' in the island), [[oyster]]s, [[European lobster|lobster]] and crabs – especially [[Maja squinado|spider crabs]] – [[Abalone|ormers]] and [[conger]].

Jersey milk being very rich, [[cream]] and butter have played a large part in insular cooking. ''(See [[Channel Island milk]])'' However, there is no indigenous tradition of cheese making, contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy, but some cheese is produced commercially. Jersey [[fudge]], mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.

[[Jersey Royal potatoes]] are the local variety of [[new potato]], and the island is famous for its early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing côtils (steeply sloping fields). They were originally grown using [[Seaweed fertiliser|vraic]] as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, only a small portion of those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.

Apples historically were an important crop. ''Bourdélots'' are apple dumplings, but the most typical speciality is black butter (''[[Nièr beurre|lé nièr beurre]]''), a dark spicy spread prepared from apples, cider and spices. [[Cider]] used to be an important export. After decline and near-disappearance in the late 20th century, apple production is being increased and promoted. Besides cider, [[apple brandy]] is produced. Other production of alcohol drinks includes wine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Mare Wine Estate|url=http://www.lamarewineestate.com/estate/heritage|accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in 2013 the first commercial [[vodka]]s made from Jersey Royal potatoes were marketed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Double vodka on the Rock|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2013/06/01/double-vodka-on-the-rock/|accessdate=28 August 2013|newspaper=Jersey Evening Post|date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other traditional dishes are cabbage loaf, Jersey wonders (''les mèrvelles''), fliottes, bean crock (''les pais au fou''), [[Urtica dioica|nettle]] (''ortchie'') soup, vraic buns.

===Sport===
{{main|Sport in Jersey}}
[[File:Harry Vardon statue Grouville 3.jpg|thumb|A statue of Jersey golfer, [[Harry Vardon]], stands at the entrance to the Royal Jersey Golf Club]]
In its own right Jersey participates in the [[Commonwealth Games]] and in the biennial [[Island Games]], which it first hosted in [[1997 Island Games|1997]] and more recently in [[2015 Island Games|2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jersey2015.com/home |title=Island Games Jersey 2015 Bid &amp;#124; Home |publisher=Jersey2015.com |accessdate=26 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325001855/https://www.jersey2015.com/home |archivedate=25 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sporting events in which Jersey does not have international representation, when the British [[Home Nations]] are competing separately, islanders that do have high athletic skill may choose to compete for any of the Home Nations – there are, however, restrictions on subsequent transfers to represent another Home Nation.

Jersey is an associate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC). The [[Jersey cricket team]] plays in the [[Inter-insular match]] among others. The Jersey cricket team competed in the World Division 4, held in [[Tanzania]] in October 2008, after recently finishing as runners-up and therefore being promoted from the World Division 5 held in Jersey. They also competed in the European Division 2, held in Guernsey during August 2008. The youth cricket teams have been promoted to play in the European Division 1 alongside Ireland, Scotland, Denmark, the Netherlands and [[Guernsey]]. In two tournaments at this level Jersey have finished 6th.

For horseracing, [[Les Landes Racecourse]] can be found at Les Landes in St. Ouen next to the ruins of [[Grosnez Castle]].

The [[Jersey Football Association]] supervises football in Jersey. The Jersey Football Combination has nine teams in its top division. [[Jersey national football team]] plays in the annual [[Muratti]] competition among others.

[[Rugby union in Jersey]] comes under the auspices of the Jersey Rugby Association (JRA), which is a member of the [[Rugby Football Union]] of England. [[Jersey Reds]] compete in the [[English rugby union system]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrfc.je/ |title=Jersey Rugby Football Club |publisher=Jrfc.je |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; after four promotions in five seasons, the last three of which were consecutive, they competed in the second-level [[RFU Championship]] in 2012–13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/17678699 |title=Jersey promoted: The rise and rise of an island side |first=Tim |last=Pryor |work=[[BBC Radio Jersey]] |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 April 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jersey has two public indoor swimming pools. Swimming in the sea, windsurfing and other marine sports are practised. Jersey Swimming Club have organised an annual swim from Elizabeth Castle to Saint Helier Harbour for over 50 years. A round-island swim is a major challenge that a select number of swimmers have achieved. The Royal Channel Island Yacht Club is based in Jersey.

There is one facility for [[extreme sports]] and some facilities for youth sports. Jersey has one un-roofed skateboarding park. Coastal cliffs provide opportunities for [[rock climbing]].

Two professional [[golf]]ers from Jersey have won [[the Open Championship]] seven times between them; [[Harry Vardon]] won six times and [[Ted Ray (golfer)|Ted Ray]] won once. Vardon and Ray also won the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] once each. Harry Vardon's brother, [[Tom Vardon]], had wins on various European tours.

===Literature===
[[File:Victor Hugo-Exile.jpg|right|thumb|[[Victor Hugo]] in exile, 1850s.]]
[[Wace]], a Norman poet of the 12th century, is Jersey's earliest known author. [[Printing]] arrived in Jersey only in the 1780s, but the island supported a multitude of regular publications in French (and Jèrriais) and English throughout the 19th century, in which poetry, most usually topical and satirical, flourished (see [[Jèrriais literature]]).The first Jèrriais book to be published was ''Rimes et Poésies Jersiaises de divers auteurs réunies et mises en ordre'', edited by Abraham Mourant in 1865. Writers born in Jersey include [[Elinor Glyn]], [[John Lemprière]], [[Philippe Le Sueur Mourant]], [[Robert Pipon Marett]] and [[Augustus Asplet Le Gros]]. [[Frederick Tennyson]] and [[Gerald Durrell]] were among authors who made Jersey their home. Contemporary authors based in Jersey include [[Jack Higgins]].

==Education==

===Schools===
{{See also|List of schools in Jersey}}
The [[States of Jersey]] provides education through state schools (including a fee-paying option at secondary level) and also supports private schools. The Jersey curriculum follows that of England.&lt;ref name="Curriculum"/&gt; It follows the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] although there are a few differences to adapt for the island,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.je/Education/Schools/ChildLearning/Pages/UnderstandingCurriculum.aspx|title=Understanding the curriculum|last=Jersey|first=States of|website=www.gov.je|language=en|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example all Year 4 students study a six-week Jersey Studies course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jerriais.org.je/learning.html|title=L'Office du Jèrriais|website=www.jerriais.org.je|language=en|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further and higher education===
Jersey has a college of further education and university centre, [[Highlands College, Jersey|Highlands College]]. As well as offering part-time and evening courses, Highlands is also a [[sixth form]] provider, working alongside [[Hautlieu School]] which offers the only non-fee-paying sixth form, and works collaboratively with a range of organisations including the [[Open University]], [[University of Plymouth]] and [[London South Bank University]]. In particular students can study at Highlands for the two-year foundation degree in financial services and for a BSc in social sciences, both validated by the [[University of Plymouth]].

The [[Institute of Law, Jersey|Institute of Law]] is Jersey's [[law school]], providing a course for students seeking to qualify as Jersey advocates and solicitors. It also provides teaching for students enrolled on the University of London LLB degree programme, via the [[University of London International Programmes|International Programmes]]. The Institute of Law also runs a 'double degree' course: students can obtain the LLB from the University of London and a ''Licence en droit M1'' from Toulouse 1 Capitol University; the two combine 4 years of studies in both English and French. The Open University supports students in Jersey, but they pay higher fees than UK students. Private sector higher education providers include the Jersey International Business School.

Jersey is the home of the [[Jersey Zoo]] (formerly known as the Durrell Wildlife Park&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.durrell.org/wildlife/news/time-to-be-a-zoo-again/ Time to be a zoo again]&lt;/ref&gt;) founded by the naturalist, zookeeper and author [[Gerald Durrell]].

===Biodiversity===
Four species of small mammal are considered native:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.je/PlanningEnvironment/Environment/Countryside/Research+and+Monitoring/Species+Based+Research+Projects/The+Jersey+Mammal+Survey.htm Species Based Research Projects – The Jersey Mammal Survey]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319015634/http://www.gov.je/PlanningEnvironment/Environment/Countryside/Research%2Band%2BMonitoring/Species%2BBased%2BResearch%2BProjects/The%2BJersey%2BMammal%2BSurvey.htm |date=19 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the wood mouse (''[[Apodemus sylvaticus]]''), the Jersey bank vole (''[[Myodes glareolus]] caesarius''), the Lesser white-toothed shrew (''[[Crocidura suaveolens]]'') and the French shrew (''[[Sorex coronatus]]''). Three wild mammals are well-established introductions: the rabbit (introduced in the mediaeval period), the [[red squirrel]] and the [[hedgehog]] (both introduced in the 19th century). The stoat (''[[Mustela erminea]]'') became extinct in Jersey between 1976 and 2000. The Green lizard ([[Lacerta bilineata]]) is a protected species of reptile; Jersey is its only habitat in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.je/NR/rdonlyres/49FE3DB3-8518-4818-A513-A100793C929C/0/BiodiversityActionPlansII.pdf Biodiversity Action Plan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407204542/http://www.gov.je/NR/rdonlyres/49FE3DB3-8518-4818-A513-A100793C929C/0/BiodiversityActionPlansII.pdf |date=7 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[red-billed chough]] ''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'' became extinct in Jersey around 1900, when changes in farming and grazing practices led to a decline in the coastal slope habitat required by this species. Birds on the Edge, a project between [[States of Jersey]], [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]] and Jersey National Trust, is working to restore Jersey's coastal habitats and reinstate the red-billed chough (and other bird species) to the island&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdsontheedge.org/|title=Birds on the Edge Project |accessdate=28 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jersey is the only place in the British Isles where the agile frog ''Rana dalmatina'' is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Environment/LandMarineWildlife/ColdBlooded/Pages/Frogs.aspx |title=Agile frog protection plans |publisher=States of Jersey www.gov.je |date=2016 |accessdate=28 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining population of agile frogs on Jersey is very small and is restricted to the south west of the island. The species is the subject of an ongoing programme to save it from extinction in Jersey via a collaboration between [[States of Jersey]], [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]] and Jersey Amphibian and Reptile Group (JARG), with support and sponsorship from several other organisations. The programme includes captive breeding and release, public awareness and habitat restoration activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.durrell.org/animals/amphibians/agile-frog/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106202756/http://www.durrell.org/Animals/Amphibians/Agile-Frog/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 January 2009 |title=Agile frog |publisher=Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust |accessdate=28 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trees generally considered native are the alder (''[[Alnus glutinosa]]''), silver birch (''[[Betula pendula]]''), sweet chestnut (''[[Castanea sativa]]''), hazel (''[[Corylus avellana]]''), hawthorn (''[[Crataegus monogyna]]''), beech (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]''), ash (''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]''), aspen (''[[Populus tremula]]''), wild cherry (''[[Prunus avium]]''), blackthorn (''[[Prunus spinosa]]''), holm oak (''[[Quercus ilex]]''), oak (''[[Quercus robur]]''), sallow (''[[Salix cinerea]]''), elder (''[[Sambucus nigra]]''), elm (''[[Ulmus]]'' spp.) and medlar (''[[Mespilus germanica]]'').

The States of Jersey Fire Service was formed in 1938 when the States took over the Saint Helier Fire Brigade, which had been formed in 1901. The first lifeboat was equipped, funded by the States, in 1830. The RNLI established a lifeboat station in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rnli.org/findmynearest/station/Pages/St-Helier-Lifeboat-Station.aspx |title=St Helier History |publisher=Rnli.org.uk |date=14 December 1982 |accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Border security and customs controls are undertaken by the [[States of Jersey Customs and Immigration Service]]. Jersey has adopted the [[112 (emergency telephone number)|112 emergency number]] alongside its existing [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999 emergency number]].

}}'''Laurence McKinley "Larry" Gould''' (August 22, 1896 – June 21, 1995) was an [[Americans|American]] [[geologist]], [[educator]], and [[List of polar explorers|polar explorer]].

==Biography==
Gould was born in [[Lacota, Michigan]] on August 22, 1896. After completing high school in [[South Haven, Michigan]] in 1914, he went to [[Boca Raton, Florida]] and taught grades 1 to 8 in a [[one room school|one-room school]] for two years, while saving money for college. He enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1916, but interrupted his education the following year to enlist in the [[U.S. Army]] following U.S. entry into [[World War I]]. He served in the Army until 1919, when he returned to the university to resume his studies.

After graduating in 1921 with a B.S. degree in geology he joined the University of Michigan faculty as a geology instructor while continuing his studies there. During his undergraduate days, he was the founder of the Beta Tau Chapter of the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] Fraternity. He also was an active member in the university [[Society of Les Voyageurs]]. He received an M.A. degree in 1923 and a D.Sc. degree in 1925, with a  [[dissertation]] on the geology of [[Utah]]'s [[La Sal Mountains]], and he advanced to assistant professor in 1926, and to associate professor in 1930.

In the summer of 1926 Gould undertook his first trip to the [[Arctic]], serving as assistant director and geologist with the University of Michigan [[Greenland]] Expedition. The following summer he was geographer and topologist for [[George P. Putnam]]'s expedition to survey the coast of [[Baffin Island]] in [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Arctic Canada]].

During 1928 to 1930 he accompanied [[Richard E. Byrd|Admiral Richard E. Byrd]] on Byrd's first expedition to [[Antarctica]], serving as the expedition's chief scientist and second-in-command.  On November 4, 1929 Gould and five companions began a grueling 2½ month, 1500-mile dog-sledge journey into the [[Queen Maud Mountains]], with the primary purpose of providing ground support and possible emergency assistance for Byrd's historic first airplane flight over the [[South Pole]] and a secondary purpose of conducting the first geological and glaciological survey of an area that Gould called "a veritable paradise for a geologist."&lt;ref name=LaurenceMcKinleyGouldOnlineExhibit&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the flight over the Pole in November 1929, Gould and his companions climbed [[Mount Fridtjof Nansen]] to investigate its geology. The layered sandstones that Gould found in outcrops at the mountain's peak helped confirm that Antarctica was linked geologically to the Earth's other continents.

The expedition's progress had been reported regularly in the news media, and after his return he received a [[Congressional Gold Medal]], the 1930 [[David Livingstone]] Gold Medal of the [[American Geographical Society]], and a Medal of the Mayor's Committee of the [[City of New York]].

On August 2, 1930, two weeks after returning from Antarctica, Gould married Margaret ("Peg") Rice in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. She had been a student in one of his classes at the University of Michigan.

In the months and years after returning from Antarctica, Gould traveled around the US giving lectures on the experience. His 1931 book ''Cold: the Record of an Antarctic Sledge Journey''  described the dog-sledge trek, recalling blinding [[blizzard]]s, [[snow bridge]]s that collapsed into deep crevasses, and weather so cold that it nearly froze a person's eyelids shut.  Additionally, he published several scientific articles about the findings of the Byrd expedition.

In 1932 Gould accepted a position as full professor and chairman of the geology department at [[Carleton College]], so the Goulds moved to [[Minnesota]]. Gould was named president of the college in 1945, holding that position until 1962. In 1963 he retired to Tucson, Arizona and taught Glaciology at the University of Arizona.

He also served as [[President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]].

During his lifetime, Gould was the recipient of 26 honorary degrees.&lt;ref name="LaurenceMcKinleyGouldOnlineExhibit"/&gt;
In 1995 Carleton College renamed its college library the ''Laurence McKinley Gould Library'' in his honor. The [[Research Vessel Laurence M. Gould|R/V Laurence M. Gould]], a 76-m-long ice-strengthened research ship built in 1997 for the [[National Science Foundation]] and designed for year-round polar operations, is named in his honor.&lt;ref name=NSF&gt;

'''Lietuvos skaučių seserija''' (LSSes; ''Lithuanian Girl Guides'') is a [[Girl Guides|Guiding]] association in [[Lithuania]]. Guiding in Lithuania started in 1926, was banned by the Soviets in 1940 and restarted in 1990.

The association became an associate member of the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS) in 2008. The girls-only association had 742 members in 2012.&lt;ref name="36 World Conference WAGGGS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wagggs.org/documents/2160/TERMINATION_OF_WAGGGS_MEMBERSHIP.pdf |title=Change of Entity. World Conference Document No. 10 |publisher=[[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] |accessdate=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After three years without contacts to the LSSes, the Europe Committee and the World Board of WAGGGS recommended a termination of membership in 2017.&lt;ref name="36 World Conference WAGGGS"/&gt; The respective motion was not carried during the 36th World Conference and LSSes retained its membership.

The organizations has strong ties to Lithuanian [[Scouts-in-Exile]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

The [[Guide Motto]] is ''Budėk'', translating as ''Be Prepared'' in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. 

The Guide emblem incorporates the [[Cross of Lorraine]].

The [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) include some members that are not [[sovereign state]]s; thus, neither organization ever speaks of "member states"; the WTO has simply "members" (see [[World Trade Organization accession and membership|WTO members]]), whereas the IMF calls its members "member countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/country/index.htm |title=IMF Country Information |publisher=Imf.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the May 1967, while home from his first year of college, Tearson went to the "15 Below Coffeehouse" to participate in the talent show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=73430 15 Below Coffeehouse, Timonium] Retrieved 29 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; "15 Below Coffeehouse" was located in Timonium near the Maryland State Fair grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marylandstatefair.com/ Maryland State Fair] Retrieved 29 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Before his performance, a very young [[Emmylou Harris]], age 19, made her appearance, taking the audience by surprise with her amazing voice and talent. Not getting noticed for his own performance, Tearson realized that he needed to make a change in his goals. He befriended Emmylou Harris, beginning a lifelong friendship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.geosound.org/michaeltearson-interview.htm Michael Tearson Interview about his Life] Retrieved 29 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tearson obtained a bachelor's degree in political science in 1970 from the [[University of Pennsylvania]].
As an undergraduate Tearson had his first appearance on the air with WXPN from 1967 to 1970. This was the very first FM Rock shift on WXPN; the show was entitled "The Attic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xpn.org/ WXPN University of Pennsylvania] Retrieved 21 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1970, Tearson joined WDAS-FM Hyski’s Underground as overnighter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hylitradio.com/index.php?page=6  WDAS-FM] Retrieved 21 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Tearson has been a longtime member of "Broadcast Pioneers",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/ Broadcast Pioneers] retrieved 20 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and he has been involved with [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] in the United States since its infancy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/bp3/michaeltearson.html Broadcast Pioneers with Michael Tearson] Retrieved 19 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to early 1990s==
In June 1970, WMMR hired Tearson as a Music Director and weekend disc jockey.  Tearson then moved into the late night personality segment in September 1970 and became a popular on air voice until 1976. Tearson returned two years later to WMMR in 1978 to the 10PM to 2AM time period as “Michael Tearson”. His specialty shows including “Psychedelic Psupper”, “For Headphones Only”, “The Import Show”, Import/Export” and “Gorilla Theatre”.  Soon after leaving WMMR, in March 1992 Michael Tearson started an on-air show at [[WXPN]], [[Philadelphia Pennsylvania]], which included a free-form hour-long segment called “The Attic”.

==Late 1990s to early 2000s==
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, he was very diverse in his expertise as a DJ, working to develop special programs for [[WMMR]] with the “A to Z” broadcast and also redeveloped WMMR’s live concert library in the WMMarchives. Both programs are still very popular at the station. He was also involved with [[WXPN]] ''"Late Nights"'', which was a diverse and imaginative late-night mix of music. Michael Tearson's studio in his home is called “LynTown Sound”, named after his wife who died from breast cancer on May 10, 1995. The week she died Michael Tearson had an on-air interview scheduled with the band [[Little Feat]] and against the advice of many of his friends, he went on to do the show on Sunday May 14, 1995, before they appeared at Penn’s Landing, in Philadelphia. Tearson is good friends with Little Feat and mentions in an interview with Geosound that they helped him through that difficult time with losing his wife.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; From 1994-1996, Michael Tearson produced and voiced “The Wall” which was an in-store radio broadcast, at one of their record store chains. In April 2002, [[WMGK]] approached Michael Tearson with an offer to produce a segment for Saturday mornings from 6AM-8AM; it was called “Saturday Morning 60s Show”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmgk.com/shows/michael-tearson/home.aspx  Michael Tearson /WMGK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903065303/http://www.wmgk.com/shows/michael-tearson/home.aspx |date=2011-09-03 }} Retrieved 9June11&lt;/ref&gt;

October, 2010, Written by Frank Halperin, South Jersey Magazine, Vol 7, Issue 7 Retrieved 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Tearson also writes for two magazines: “Sing Out”, which is a folk song magazine, and The Audiophile Voice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theaudiophilevoice.com/ The Audiophile Voice Magazine] Retrieved 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000s==
Tearson started at Sirius Radio (Sirius Folk Town) in July 2004-October 2005. He was also the main producer and voice of
"The Bob Dylan Radio Hour" which aired twice on Sundays. Tearson moved to "Sirius Classic Vinyl", March 2006-November 2008 which he broadcast Monday through Friday in the afternoons. [[Sirius XM Radio]] was also interested in Michael Tearson and picked him up to work on "Deep Tracks" in November 2008.

==2010s and beyond==
In July, 2011 Tearson released ''"Stuff That Works"'' which was a collaboration of friends that pulled together to create music that Michael Tearson called "A Philosophy". An interview by Jonathan Takiff from philly.com on August 24, 2011 captures the enthusiasm of this project that was a dream come true for Tearson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2011-08-24/entertainment/29922475_1_cd-release-robert-hazard-music-writer Radio DJ drops his own tracks] August 24, 2011 By Jonathan Takiff Retrieved 18 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Tearson was also interviewed by Jim Six from South Jersey Newspapers. Michael tells Jim Six “The title of the CD “Stuff That Works” is named after a Guy Clark song that isn’t even on the album.” Tearson mentions all who contributed to the CD, which are [[Tom Hampton]], Andy Kravitz, Fran Smith Jr. and Rob Hyman (of [[The Hooters]]), Ted Estersohn, Jay Davidson, Laine Walker Hughes and Lauren Hart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/gloucestercounty/towns/index.ssf/2011/08/tearson_finds_stuff_that_works.html Tearson finds ‘Stuff That Works’ for first CD] August 12, 2011 written by Jim Six, South Jersey Newspapers  Retrieved 18 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 09, 2011, Kevin Riordan of the Inquirer writes about  Tearson's ''Stuff That Works'' CD release. He interviewed Michael at his home studio, discussing the songs that are on the CD. Michael had said "The best compliment I've gotten about my album, is that different people pick wildly different songs as their favorite." &lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2011-10-09/news/30260441_1_online-station-neil-diamond-fm Kevin Riordan: Michael Tearson, former WMMR mix maestro, lays tracks of his own] October 09, 2011|By Kevin Riordan, Inquirer Columnist, Retrieved 15 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Since April 2002, Tearson produced the weekly 1960s-themed morning show for WMGK, using his expertise and knowledge of [[pop rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[blues rock]] and [[folk rock]], all which can be found in Tearson’s private record library, located at LynTown Sound Studio. On January 15, 2013, WMGK canceled the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/gizmo/187013276.html#ixzz2I6k6nfsp  Tearson Bites the Dust at WMGK ], January 15, 2013  Retrieved 21 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2015, Tearson announced he had departed Sirius/XM Radio after 12 years on the air, soured by corporate tinkering with his program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobile.philly.com/blogs/?wss=/philly/blogs/entertainment/music_nightlife/&amp;id=317811221&amp; Philly radio veteran Michael Tearson no longer broadcasting on SiriusXM] Written by Allie Volpe, Retrieved 21 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Tearson was working with George Manney at Philly Pop Music as the narrator and executive producer for Manney's documentary on Philadelphia's diversified musical community. The project is on hold following the death of Manney in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillypopmusic.com/index.html George Manney and Michael Tearson at Philly Pop Music]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2015-12-12/news/68963024_1_archivist-michael-tearson-electric-factory, George Manney Dies] By Claire Sasko, Inquirer Staff Writer retrieved 15 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Neatkarīgā Rīta Avīze''''' (literally ''Independent Morning Newspaper'') is a [[Latvian language]] national daily [[newspaper]] in [[Latvia]], published in [[Riga]].

==History==
Forerunner of the newspaper was the party organ of the [[Communist Party of Latvia#Latvian Social-Democracy prior to 1919|Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party]] ''Cīņa'' (The Struggle) appearing since 1904. In 1919, ''Cīņa'' was taken over by the [[Communist Party of Latvia]] and remained the main party organ until 1990. With Latvian independence in 1990, the newspaper's staff ceased collaborating with the party and formed ''Neatkarīga Cīņa'' (The Independent Struggle) with new editors. This should later become the Neatkarīgā Rīta Avīze. Today's editor-in-chief is Anita Daukšte.

During [[World War II]], '''Operation Attila''' was a plan for the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation of [[Vichy France]]. This plan was drawn up in 1940 in case the French rejoined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] or in case of an Allied threat to the south of France.

An important aspect was the capture of the [[French Navy]].

The original plan was never executed, but a version (''[[Case Anton]]'') which included Italian forces was executed on 11 November 1942 in response to the [[Operation Torch|Torch]] landings in North Africa.

The attempt to capture the French fleet (Operation ''Lila'') failed. Most of the [[Scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon|French fleet at Toulon was scuttled]] by order of Admiral [[Jean de Laborde]] to prevent its capture. As a result of this action, the Germans and Italians failed to gain the use of three battleships, seven cruisers, twenty-eight destroyers and twenty submarines. However, the destruction of the fleet also denied it to [[Charles de Gaulle]] and the [[Free French Forces]], explaining Hitler's satisfaction at the result.

'''Oshikango''' is a constituency in the town of [[Helao Nafidi]] in the [[Ohangwena Region]] of northern [[Namibia]], on the border to [[Angola]]. It has 27,599 inhabitants&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statoids.com/yna.html Constituencies of Namibia, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; and covers the [[Oshikango]] suburb from which it has its name.

==Politics==
The first Regional Councillor of Oshikango Constituency was [[Michael Hishikushitja]]. He served in that position until his death in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As is common in all constituencies of former [[Owamboland]], Namibia's ruling [[South West Africa People's Organization|SWAPO Party]] won the [[Namibian local and regional elections, 2015|2015 regional election]] by a landslide. Its candidate [[Fillippus Namundjebo]] gathered 6,023 votes, while the opposition candidates Timotheus Shikongo of the [[Rally for Democracy and Progress (Namibia)|Rally for Democracy and Progress]] (RDP) and Gabriel Shikudule of the [[Democratic Turnhalle Alliance]] (DTA), received 451 and 172 votes, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Regional Council Election Results 2015 | publisher=[[Electoral Commission of Namibia]] | date=3 December 2015 | page=14 | url=http://www.ecn.na/documents/27857/223442/Regional+Counils+Election+Results_Duly+elected+candidates+2015.pdf/32493774-80b3-4be3-9ca1-1f6ce187673a?version=1.0 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208163948/http://www.ecn.na/documents/27857/223442/Regional+Counils+Election+Results_Duly+elected+candidates+2015.pdf/32493774-80b3-4be3-9ca1-1f6ce187673a?version=1.0 | archivedate=8 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Ostani kraj mene"''' (Stay beside me) was the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian and Herzegovinian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994]], performed in [[Bosnian Language|Bosnian]] by [[Alma Čardžić|Alma]] and [[Dejan Lazarević (singer)|Dejan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diggiloo.net/?1994ba Ostani kraj mene], Diggiloo.net. Retrieved 1 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was performed eighteenth on the night (following [[Norway]]'s [[Elisabeth Andreassen]] &amp; [[Jan Werner Danielsen]] with "[[Duett (Rolf Løvland song)|Duett]]" and preceding [[Greece]]'s [[Costas Bigalis]] &amp; [[The Sea Lovers]] with "[[To Trehandiri]]". At the close of voting, it had received 39 points, placing 15th in a field of 25.

The song is a love duet, in which one singer claims that "All the pain will vanish/Except this song, me and you".

Available at http://www.stat.kz {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314092716/http://stat.kz/ |date=2010-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has a territory of 2,727,300&amp;nbsp;km² (greater than [[Western Europe]]). It is bordered by [[Russia]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]]. The country also borders on a significant part of the [[Caspian Sea]].

Vast in size, the land in Kazakhstan is very diverse in types of terrain: flatlands, steppes, taigas, rock-canyons, hills, deltas, mountains, snow-capped mountains, and deserts. Kazakhstan has the [[List of countries by population|62nd largest]] population in the world, with a [[List of countries by population density|population density]] of less than 6&amp;nbsp;people per square kilometre (15&amp;nbsp;per sq. mi.).

Kazakhstan declared itself an independent country on December 16, 1991, the last Soviet republic to do so. Its communist-era leader, [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], became the country's new president. Since independence, Kazakhstan has pursued a balanced [[Foreign relations of Kazakhstan|foreign policy]] and worked to develop its [[Economy of Kazakhstan|economy]], especially its [[hydrocarbon]] industry. While the country's economic outlook is improving, President Nazarbayev maintains strict control over the country's [[Politics of Kazakhstan|politics]]. Several opposition leaders and journalists have been killed in recent years, and Western observers generally do not consider [[Elections in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan's elections]] to be free and fair. Nevertheless, Kazakhstan's international prestige is building.&lt;ref&gt;Zarakhovich, Yuri (September 27, 2006). [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1539999,00.html "Kazakhstan Comes on Strong"], Time Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now considered to be the dominant state in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2008/5/3442f45a-7517-425d-956c-78d0c6af7ac2.html Medvedev Visit Underscores Kazakh Victory Over Uzbekistan For Regional Dominance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528014300/http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2008/5/3442f45a-7517-425d-956c-78d0c6af7ac2.html |date=2008-05-28 }} Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&lt;/ref&gt; The country belongs to many international organizations, including the [[United Nations]], [[Partnership for Peace|NATO's Partnership for Peace]], the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]]. In 2010, Kazakhstan will chair the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]]. In 2011, it formed a [[Eurasian Economic Community|customs union]] with Russia and [[Belarus]].

Kazakhstan is ethnically and culturally diverse, in part due to [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|mass deportations]] of many ethnic groups to the country during [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] rule. Kazakhs are the largest group, followed by Russians. Kazakhstan allows [[Freedom of religion in Kazakhstan|freedom of religion]], and many different beliefs are represented in the country. [[Islam]] is the primary religion, followed by [[Orthodox Christianity]]. The official language is [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], though [[Russian language|Russian]] is still commonly used for everyday communication.

'''Southernmost settlements''' are cities, towns, weather stations or permanent military bases which are farther south than [[45th parallel south|latitude 45°S]]. They are closely related to the [[Southern Ocean]] or either the [[Roaring Forties]] or [[Furious Fifties]].

==Southernmost city==
''The southernmost city in the world'' is mainly a slogan used for tourism to attract visitors to the city as well as the tourists headed for Antarctica. Currently three places use this slogan: [[Ushuaia]] in [[Argentina]] as well as [[Punta Arenas]] and [[Puerto Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1998/06/30/e-04801d.htm|title=Ushuaia ya no será la ciudad más austral del mundo|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismopaliaike.com/williams.htm Puerto Williams: ubicada entre Tierra del Fuego por el norte y el Cabo de Hornos por el sur , por lo tanto es la cuidad mas Austral del país y del mundo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infinito-sur.com/spanish/chile/chile.html http://www.infinito-sur.com/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422042924/http://www.infinito-sur.com/spanish/chile/chile.html |date=2013-04-22 }}, retrieved 9 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subpesca.cl/controls/neochannels/neo_ch1089/appinstances/media1278/Tercera_edici%C3%B3n.pdf Puerto Williams espera una gran temporada de centolla]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 9 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educarchile.cl/Portal.Base/Web/VerContenido.aspx?ID=194305 Escritorio Estudiantes], retrieved 9 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dibam.cl/dinamicas/DocAdjunto_1242.pdf dibam], retrieved 9 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/destinations/latin_america/article5370077.ece Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Website thisischile.cl [http://www.thisischile.cl/1116/2/249/puerto-williams,-the-southernmost-town-in-the-world/Article.aspx Puerto Williams, the southernmost town in the world]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chile]], with the latter being the absolute southernmost town by latitude (see table below). There are several more settlements further south but none are considered to be large enough to be classified as a '[[city]]'. The three contending cities are from north to south:

*'''[[Punta Arenas]]''' ({{coord|53|10|S|70|56|W}}, pop:130,136), literally in Spanish: "Sands Point", is the oldest and largest city in Southern [[Patagonia]], at the [[Strait of Magellan]] and the capital of the [[Magallanes and Antártica Chilena Region]]. It is the largest of the three contenders with around 130,000 permanent residents&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ine.cl/ine/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/censo2002/mapa_interactivo/mapa_interactivo.htm Interactive map, INE Census 2002, Chile. (Click on XII Region and then on Punta Arenas)]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is called the southernmost city by some media outlets. The basis of its claim to be the southernmost city rests on it being larger than [[Ushuaia]], [[Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego|Río Grande (Argentina)]], and [[Puerto Williams]], all of which are farther south.

*The former Argentine base [[Corbeta Uruguay]] (59°28′ S) in [[South Sandwich Islands]] was the southernmost settlement outside Antarctica from 1976–1982.

==Settlements on the Antarctic continent==

There are many research stations in Antarctica, both permanent and summer only. Many of the stations are staffed all year. [[McMurdo Station]] is the largest with an average population of 1200.

A total of 30 countries (as of October 2006), all signatory to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], operate seasonal (summer) or year-round research stations on the continent and on its surrounding islands. In addition to these permanent stations, approximately 30 field camps are established each austral summer to support specific one off projects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1997/antpanel/4past.htm 4.0 Antarctica – Past and Present&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Resupplying troops in the jungle by [[Airdrop|air drop]]  during [[World War II]] was proving problematic. Regular parachutes were costly in both money and material. Drops without parachutes risked loss of the materials due to the impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Australian Inventions Directorate in headed by Sir [[Laurence Hartnett]] tasked the Ordnance Production Directorate to produce a solution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

G.W Griffiths, on a [[secondment]] with the directorate, came up with the answer. to examine the problem. A [[Dashpot|shock absorbent]] heavy-gauge wire netting container to absorb the impact. Griffiths named this an 'Aeropak'. The design also allows for a parachute to be attached to slow the descent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The design was refined by Morris &amp; Walker Pty Ltd of [[Melbourne]]. The printing firm added a three foot cardboard cylinder to carry 250lbs. A [[Hessian fabric|hessian]] parachute was also added. The hollow nose cone is hollow which also takes a proportion on the impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Storpedo was test dropped from a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] aircraft at [[Nadzab]] in [[New Guinea]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Storepedo was used by Australian and US forces in the South-West Pacific. Small aircraft, for example the [[CAC Wirraway]], could carry the container. Use of smaller aircraft resulted in greater accuracy of the drops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

The Storpedo was used to supply liberated [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] in [[Timor]] following the 1945 [[surrender of Japan]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

After the war, the Storpedo was used to supply victims of flooding in [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The names on the [[patent]] are E.R. Campbell, K.M. Frewin, F.W. Lennox and R.P. Morris.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
