      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11279">{{redirect|Avoué|the modern legal officer in France and Belgium|Avoué (legal office)}}
During the [[Middle Ages]], the Latin word '''''advocatus''''' (in English, [[advocate]]; in French ''avoué''; in German, ''[[Vogt]]'') was a general term for any person called (''ad vocatus'') to defend another, such as a lawyer or an ''advocatus ecclesiae'', usually a lay [[lord]] charged with the protecting a  particular church.

The ''advocatus'' as an officer of a court of law first appears in the 12th and 13th centuries, concomitant with the [[Medieval Roman law|rediscovery of Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Louis Gazzaniga, "Advocate", in [[André Vauchez]] (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'' (Oxford University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Advocatus ecclesiae''==
The term ''advocatus ecclesiae'', literally "advocate of the church", is the Latin title of certain persons whose duty it was, under given conditions, to represent a particular church or monastery, and to defend its rights against force. These advocates were specially bound to represent their clients before the secular courts. They exercised civil jurisdiction in the domain of the church or monastery, and were bound to protect the church with arms in the event of actual assault. Finally, it was their duty to lead the men-at-arms in the name of the church or monastery, and to command them in time of war. In return for these services the advocate received certain definite revenues from the possessions of the church, in the form of supplies or services, which he could demand, or in the form of a lien on the church property.

Such advocates are to be found even in Roman times; a Synod of Carthage decreed, in 401, that the emperor should be requested to provide, in conjunction with the bishops, defensores for the churches.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hefele]], Conciliengeschichte, 2d ed., I, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence, moreover, for such ''defensores ecclesiæ'' in Italy, at the close of the fifth century, but [[Pope Gregory I]] confined the office to members of the clergy. It was the duty of these defensores to protect the poor, and to defend the rights and possessions of the church.

In the [[Frankish Kingdom]], under the [[Merovingians]], these lay representatives of the churches appear as ''agentes'', ''defensores'' and ''advocati''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Under the [[Carolingian]]s, the duties of the church advocate were enlarged and defined according to the principles of government which prevailed in the reign of [[Charlemagne]]; henceforward we meet with the advocatus ecclesiæ in the medieval sense. A [[Capitulary]] of about 790&lt;ref&gt;Monumenta German. Histor., Cap. Reg. Francor., I, 201.&lt;/ref&gt; ordained that the higher clergy, "for the sake of the churches honour, and the respect due to the priesthood" (''pro ecclesiastico honore, et pro sacerdotum reverentia'') should have advocates. Charlemagne, who obliged bishops, abbots and abbesses to maintain advocati, commanded to exercise great care in the choice of persons to fill the office; they must be judicious men, familiar with the law, and owning property in the -then still administrative- countship (''Grafschaft'').&lt;ref&gt;See Capitulary of 802, and 801-13, 1. c. I, 93, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The churches, monasteries and canonries, as such, alike received advocates, who by degrees assumed the position above defined.

Under the Carolingians it was made obligatory on [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s and [[abbess]]es to appoint such officials in every [[county]] where they held [[property]]. The office was not [[hereditary]], the advocatus being chosen, either by the abbot alone, or by the abbot and bishop concurrently with the [[count]]. The same causes that led to the development of the [[feudal]] system also affected the advocatus. In times of confusion churches and abbeys needed not so much a legal representative as an armed protector, while as feudal [[Immunity from prosecution|immunities]] were conceded to the [[ecclesiastical]] foundations, these required a representative to defend their rights and to fulfill their secular obligations to the state, such as leading the ecclesiastical levies to [[war]]. A new class of ''advocatus'' thus arose, whose office, commonly rewarded by a grant of land, crystallized into a [[fief]], which, like other fiefs, had by the beginning of the 11th century become hereditary.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the time of Charlemagne the king had the right to appoint the advocates, but many ecclesiastical institutions obtained the right of election. The office was not, at first, hereditary, nor even for life; in the post-Carolingian period, however, it developed into an hereditary one, and was held by powerful nobles, who constantly endeavoured to enlarge their rights in connection with the church or the monastery. Conciliar decrees were passed as early as the ninth century to protect ecclesiastical institutions against the excessive claims of their advocates, who indeed became in many ways a heavy burden to their ecclesiastical clients. They dealt with the possessions entrusted to them as with their own property, plundered the church estate, appropriated the tithes and other revenues, and oppressed in every possible way those whom they were appointed to protect.

The office, since it offered many advantages, was eagerly sought after. The excessive claims of the advocates gave rise to many disputes between them and the churches or monasteries. The bishops and abbots, who found their rights seriously curtailed, appealed to the Holy Roman Emperor and to the Pope for protection. In the twelfth century grave warnings issued from Rome, restraining the high-handed actions of the advocates under pain of severe ecclesiastical penalties, which still did not put an end to all the abuses that prevailed. On certain occasions, emperors and princes exercised the office of advocate, in which case they appointed deputy-advocates (''subadvocati'') to represent them.

===In France===
In [[France]], the advocati, known as ''avoués'', were of two types. The first included the great [[baron]]s, who held the advocateship (''avouerie'') of an abbey or abbeys rather as an office than a fief, though they were indemnified for the protection they afforded by a [[Dominion|domain]] and [[preach]] revenues granted by the abbey: thus the [[duke of Normandy]] was ''advocatus'' of nearly all the abbeys in the [[duchy]]. The second class included the petty [[manorialism|lords]] who held their advocateships as [[hereditary]] fiefs and often as their sole means of subsistence. An abbey's ''avoué'', of this class, corresponded to a bishop's [[vidame]]. Their function was generally to represent the abbot in his capacity as feudal lord, act as his representative in the courts of his superior, exercise secular [[justice]] in the abbot's name in the abbatial [[court]], and lead the retainers of the abbey to battle under the banner of the [[patron saint]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The ''advocatus ecclesiae'' was also known as a ''custos'' or ''adjutator'' in the 10th and 11th centuries. Initially, only counts and dukes were appointed ''advocati'', but by the end of the 11th century it was being bestowed on mere castellans. The monks usually consulted their advocate before electing a new abbot, giving the advocate influence over the selection. When a nobleman founded or reformed a monastery, he usually became its advocate. In the 12th century, the office of the advocate was on the decline, a result of the [[Gregorian reforms]].
The [[Cistercian Order]], for example, never allowed lay advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Constance B. Bouchard, "Advocatus/Avoué", in ''Medieval France: An Encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1995), pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Low Countries===
The advocatus played a more important part in the feudal polity of the Empire and of the [[Low Countries]] than in France, where his functions, confined to the protection of the interests of [[religious]] houses, were superseded from the 13th century onwards by the growth of central power and the increasing efficiency of royal administration. They had, in effect, long ceased to be effective in their original purpose, and after the advowson became a fief, they took advantage of their position to pillage and suppress those they were supposed to defend. [[Medieval]] records are full of complaints from abbots about usurpations, exactions, and acts of [[violence]] committed by the advocati.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]] (as well as in Germany) advocati were often appointed in the [[cities]], by the overlord or by the emperor, to take the place of the [[bailiff]] (Dutch ''schout'', German ''Schultheiss'') or to stand alongside this official in matters of Law.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===In England===
In [[England]], the word ''advocatus'' was never used to denote a hereditary representative of an abbot; but in some of the larger abbeys there were hereditary stewards whose functions and privileges were not dissimilar to those of the continental ''advocati''. Instead, the word ''advocatus'', or more commonly [[avowee]], was in constant use in England to denote the [[patron]] of an ecclesiastical [[benefice]], whose sole right of any importance was a hereditary one of presenting a [[parson]] to the bishop for institution. In this way the hereditary right of presentation to a benefice came to be called in English an [[advowson]] (Lat. ''advocatio'').&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==German ''Vogtei''==
In [[Germany]], the title of ''[[Vogt]]'' (''advocatus'' or "advocate") was given not only to the ''advocati'' of churches and abbeys but also, from early in the [[Middle Ages]], to officials appointed by the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] [[Emperor]] to administer lands directly under his [[dominion]], as opposed to the comital domains, owned by counts who had become hereditary princes of the Empire. The office or territory of a ''Vogt'' was a ''[[Vogt]]ei''. Land administered by a ''Vogt'' could also be known as a ''Vogtland'' (''terra advocatorum''), a name still used to refer to a region, the [[Vogtland]], that adjoins the [[principalities of Reuss]] and adjacent portions of [[Saxony]], [[Prussia]] and [[Bavaria]]. An [[empire|imperial]] advocateship tended to become hereditary. Sometimes the emperor himself assumed the title of ''Vogt'' in application to particular parts of his eminent domain.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Amba''' (also spelled Bulebule, Hamba, Humu, Kihumu, Ku-Amba, Kuamba, Lubulebule, Lwamba, Ruwenzori Kibira, and Rwamba) is a language spoken in parts of [[Uganda]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] by the [[Amba people]]. The Amba people call it Kwamba and it is known as Kihumu  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Amba has a 70% lexical similarity with [[Bera language|Bera]]. Dialects include Kyanzi (Kihyanzi) and Suwa (Kusuwa).

There was once an Amba [[pidgin]] called ''Vamba'', now extinct.&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3348">'''American Radio Relay League, Inc. v. FCC, 617 F.2d 875 (D.C. Cir. 1980)'''  was a notable Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit case between plaintiff, the [[American Radio Relay League]] and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] regarding licensing rights and [[radio frequency interference|radiofrequency interference]] (RFI).  The case was argued in the Court of Appeals on December 12, 1979 and decided on Feb. 22, 1980.&lt;ref name=justia&gt;{{cite web| title =617 F.2d 875: The American Radio Relay League, Inc., Petitioner, v. Federal Communications Co| work =Justia| url =http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/617/875/41173/|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In an effort to combat [[Citizens band radio]] interference with television and radio signals, the FCC enacted regulations on the production and sale of [[linear amplifier]]s.  The FCC justified these regulations in accordance with its mission to “prevent interference between stations”.&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;

The number of CB operators had grown drastically since the 1970s. In 1977, when licenses were still required for CB radio, 14 million licensed operators and as many as 6 million illegal operators were using CB radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FADING CB CRAZE SIGNALS END TO LICENSING|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/28/us/fading-cb-craze-signals-end-to-licensing.html|accessdate=1 July 2014|work=New York Times|date=April 28, 1983|ref=nytimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; CB-related interference to television viewers was on the rise.&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;

The American Radio Relay League (ARRL), a non-profit organization dedicated to [[amateur radio|amateur ("ham") radio]], was concerned with the effect of these rules on the amateur radio service. The ARRL did not protest regulation as a whole, but argued that the regulations had unintended consequences with regard to amateur radio.&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;

==Case==
The point in question for the court was whether or not the FCC had enacted its regulations with reasonable deliberation.  The ARRL was not requesting a complete reversal of the regulation, but it was simply desiring that the FCC be required to renegotiate its regulations and exercise more diligence and deliberation at arriving at its required regulative stances.&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;

The court sympathized with this point, believing that in all likelihood, that the FCC's decision was overly harsh on amateur radio operators. However the court believed it had insufficient reason to prove the FCC had unreasonably mandated its regulations for all radio operators.&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;

The lower court decided that the FCC was responsible for properly handling and regulating all radio and frequency industries and operations.  Therefore, its mission encompassed the larger breadth of all communications regulations.  With this regard, the court believed it could not aptly define what a reasonable regulation of CB radios would be better than what the FCC, responsible for such regulations, enforced.&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;

==Decision==
The lower court ruled in favor of the FCC. The Court of Appeals upheld the decision.&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;

.  Even when under occupation the Aowin continued to wield significant power and remained relatively independent as a powerful gold producing Akan state with relative  military superiority over neighbors.&lt;ref name="aowin" /&gt;

==General information==

Awjila is a member of the [[Berber languages|Berber]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic language family]], of the Eastern Berber subgroup. It is closely related to [[Ghadames language|Ghadames]] of Libya though considerably more endangered, with an estimated 2,000–3,000 native speakers remaining.&lt;ref&gt;Brenzinger, Matthias. "Language endangerment in northern Africa." Language diversity endangered 181 (2007): 123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] considers Awjila to be seriously endangered as the youngest speakers have reached or passed middle age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=9737&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berber languages of Libya faced severe oppression during the period of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], which has likely been the cause of the demise of some varieties such as [[Sokna language|Sokna]] and the endangerment of others, including Awjila and Ghadames. The usage of Berber/[[Amazigh language|Amazigh]] languages was effectively prohibited, and Gaddafi completely denied the existence of the [[Imazighen]] people, reportedly saying, "call yourselves whatever you want inside your homes – Berbers, children of Satan, whatever – but you are only Libyans when you leave your homes".&lt;ref name = "gaddafi"&gt;http://muftah.org/denied-existence-libyan-berbers-under-gaddafi-and-hope-for-the-current-revolution/#.VVA-EflViko Solieman, Ishrah. "Denied Existence: Libyan-Berbers under Gaddafi and Hope for the Current Revolution." Muftah. N.p., 24 Mar. 2011. Web. 11 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly targeted Amazigh rights activists (including linguists from abroad), to which can be attributed the lack of current and updated information on the Libyan Berber languages and the relatively limited content available, even in [[Arabic]], on the Internet (as opposed to the more extensive resources found on Moroccan and Algerian Amazigh varieties).  The language is, however, used on Facebook by some Awjili members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://orientalberber.wordpress.com/2014/02/18/awjili-negation-and-facebook/ Awjili negation and Facebook] Oriental Berber, Retrieved the 27 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of scholarship==

Because of the political issues in Libya, [[field work]] on Awjila has been limited. The earliest studies of the language were carried out by Müller in 1827,&lt;ref&gt;https://orientalberber.wordpress.com/2012/05/18/a-look-into-the-history-of-awjila/ Putten, Marijn Van. "A Look into the History of Awjila." Oriental Berber. N.p., 18 May 2012. Web. 11 May 2015..&lt;/ref&gt; however, his work is difficult to analyze because there were no standard conventions such as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) for [[transcribing]] it at that time and because he failed to make distinctions for various sounds in Awjila (such the difference between as [[emphatic consonants|emphatic]], [[pharyngeal consonants]] and their non-emphatic counterparts).&lt;ref name = "van Putten" /&gt; Moritz von Beurmann also contributed a short word list but some forms contradict information found in later sources.&lt;ref name = "van Putten"/&gt; The latest field work was done by Umberto Paradisi in 1960, whose data (in the form of texts) have become the basis for all future studies of the language, particularly that of contemporary scholar Marijn van Putten who has taken up the study of Awjila and other Eastern Berber varieties.  Van Putten, who has published extensively on the language, relies heavily on the work of Paradisi and has used it to compile a dictionary and a grammar within his 2014 book ''A Grammar of Awjila Berber''.&lt;ref name = "van Putten" /&gt;

==Writing system==

Although historically [[Tifinagh|Libyco-Berber languages]] were written with the [[Tifinagh]] alphabet between second century BCE and third century CE, Aujila and other Amazigh languages have remained oral for most of their modern existence. In recent times most Amazigh languages are written in either [[Latin script|Latin]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]] script, although attempts to revive the Amazigh languages and cultures have led to the reintroduction of a "[[neo-Tifinagh]]" script in several domains. Nevertheless, Gaddafi had banned the script during the 42-years of his oppressive regime and therefore it is unlikely that the few Awjila speakers make any significant use of it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tawalt.com/?p=14122 سلطات الامن الليبية تمنع نشر الملصق الرسمي لمهرجان الزي التقليدي بكباو [Libyan security authorities to prevent the publication of the official poster for the festival traditional costume Pkpau] (in Arabic).

==Grammar==

{{Empty section|date=May 2015}}

==Phonology==

Awjila has several interesting [[phonological]] features that set it apart from most other varieties of [[Berber languages|Berber]]. A few notable distinctions are listed below: (Van Putten)&lt;br/&gt;
1.	Retention of [[Proto-Berber]] [[Voiced bilabial fricative|β]] as the [[Voiced labiodental fricative|v]] rather than being lost as in most other modern varieties.&lt;ref name = "consonants"&gt;Marijn, Putten Van. "Some Notes on the Historical Consonantism of Awjila." Folia Orientalia 51 (2014): 257-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
2.	Loss of the [[pharyngealized]] [[voiced]] [[dental consonant|dental]] [[stop consonant|stop]] and entirely replaced it with the [[voiceless]] variant. Example: Awjila ''avəṭ'' vs. Tachelhit: ''iḍ'' meaning night.&lt;ref name = "consonants" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
3.	Retention of [[velar stop]] [[Voiceless velar stop|k]] where most Berber varieties have replaced it with palatal approximant [[Palatal approximant|j]]. Example: Awjila: ''təkəmmuʃt'' vs. Tachelhit: ''taymmust'' meaning bundle&lt;ref name = "consonants" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
4.	[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] of [[Voiceless alveolar fricative|s]] and [[Voiced alveolar fricative|z]] to [[Voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant|ʃ]] and [[Voiced palato-alveolar sibilant|ʒ]]&lt;ref name = "consonants" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
5.	Dominance of the [[Close front unrounded vowel|i]] [[vowel]] and seeming shift from the [[Open front unrounded vowel|a]] vowel of other varieties to i&lt;ref&gt;Van Putten, Marijn. "Some Notes on the Development of Awjila Berber Vowels1." Nordic Journal of African Studies 22.4 (2013): 236-255.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology and syntax==

Awjila also has several distinguishing features in the domains of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]]:&lt;ref name = "vocab"&gt;van Putten, Marijn. "An Aujila Berber Vocabulary."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
1.	Lacks overt [[Grammatical case|case-marking]] that has been retained in other Berber varieties.&lt;ref name = "vocab" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
2.	Lacks clitic-fronting&lt;ref name = "vocab" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
3.	Clitic –a is used with the present to express a resultative state, a feature shared only by the eastern-most Berber variety, [[Siwa language|Siwa]]&lt;ref name = "vocab" /&gt;

==Status==

Due to the already dwindled population of Awjila speakers and the continued political strife in post-[[Arab Spring]] Libya, the future of this language seems grim. Although researchers at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] (SOAS) and the president of the Congrès Mondial Amazigh have confirmed that speakers of the language still remain, all of the known speakers have been advanced in age, suggesting that younger generations are not learning Awjila.&lt;ref name = "van Putten" /&gt;

'''Bolsa Verde do Rio de Janeiro''' (Rio de Janeiro’s Environmental Exchange) or '''BVRio''' is a not-for-profit association based in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], created with the objective to create and promote the use of market mechanisms to facilitate compliance with [[Brazilian Environmental Policy|Brazilian environmental laws]].&lt;ref&gt;EPA, "[http://www.epa.gov/jius/finance/rio_de_janeiro/bolsa_verde_rio_incentivizing_green_credit_systems.html EPA]"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation, partnerships and governance ==

BVRio was created in 2011&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times 2011, "[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0e443a46-298f-11e1-a066-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3k2jxTPyU Financial Times]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valor Economico 2011, " [http://www.valor.com.br/empresas/2933954/bolsa-verde-do-rio-estreia-com-o-foco-em-reserva-legal Valor Economico]"&lt;/ref&gt; by social entrepreneurs [[Pedro Moura Costa]] and Mauricio Moura Costa in partnership with the Rio de Janeiro State Government and the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro. More recently, it has established collaboration agreements with the Brazilian Amazonian states of Pará, Amazonas, and Acre. Its board includes the participation of Funbio ([[:pt:Fundo Brasileiro para a Biodiversidade|Brazilian Fund for the Biodiversity]]), FBDS (Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development), CEBDS (the Brazilian chapter of the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]]), and high visibility citizens, including environmental economist [[:pt:Sérgio Besserman Vianna|Sérgio Besserman]], as well as representatives from Rio de Janeiro’s State and Municipal governments.

== Sectors of activity ==

Launched in December 2011, BVRio initially focused on establishing partnerships with a wide range of stakeholders from government, NGOs and industry and to identify and prioritise sectors in which to focus its efforts. After consultation with these stakeholders, it became clear that BVRio should aim at operating at both the rural and urban environments, as well as at the industrial sector:

* With relation to the land use sector, it became clear that the current priority is to support compliance with the [[Brazilian Forest Code|Brazilian Forest Law]] through the use of its mechanisms – Forest Legal Reserve Credits, Consolidation of Conservation Areas, and Reforestation Credits;&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times 2012, "[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/60b19182-42ef-11e2-a3d2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3k2jxTPyU Financial Times]"&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the urban environment, implementation of the National Solid Waste Legislation (PNRS) was identified as one of the priorities at that moment in time. For this sector, BVRio developed a system of Reverse Logistics Credits based on the collection and separation of waste conducted by low income independent waste collectors ("catadores"), creating an economic model for social inclusion and environmental benefits;&lt;ref&gt;Valor Economico 2013, "[http://www.valor.com.br/brasil/3526784/bvrio-negociara-credito-de-logistica Valor Economico]"&lt;/ref&gt;
* With relation to the industrial sector, BVRio has worked closely with the Rio de Janeiro State Government to create a greenhouse gas (GHG) Cap &amp; Trade system for the industries operating in the state. The infrastructure created is being used to run a GHG trading simulation with 20 Brazilian blue-chip companies, in partnership with the Getulio Vargas Foundation and the Companies for the Climate (Empresas pelo Clima) initiative, to serve as a pilot for a planned federal GHG Cap &amp; Trade scheme to be developed at a later stage;&lt;ref&gt;Fundacao Getulio Vargas GVces, "[http://gvces.com.br/bvrio-e-gvces-promovem-simulacao-de-mercado-de-carbono-para-empresas-no-brasil GVces]"&lt;/ref&gt;
* More recently, BVRio has focused on promoting the trading of “responsible commodities”, i.e., legal and/or sustainably produced forest and agricultural products.&lt;ref&gt;Forest Legality Alliance,"[http://www.forestlegality.org/document-library FLA]"&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the end of its first year, BVRio launched [https://www.bvrio.com a trading platform] to support the market of Forest Reserve Credits for compliance with the Brazilian Forest Law. Today, the exchange has the participation of more than 3000 participants and over 3 million ha of rural properties offering credits throughout Brazil. With relation to the reverse logistics system, the FRC Market already counts with the participation of more than 7,000 waste collectors, represented through 150 cooperatives distributed throughout the country.  The sale of Reverse Logistics credits greatly increased the income of these waste collectors (estimated at ca. 50%), generating positive social and environmental benefits.

==Prizes and awards==

In 2003 BVRio won the Katerva Award in the Economics category&lt;ref&gt;Katerva Awards, "[http://www.katerva.net/nominees/2013/economy/bolsa-verde-do-rio-de-janeiro Katerva] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914131251/http://www.katerva.net/nominees/2013/economy/bolsa-verde-do-rio-de-janeiro |date=2015-09-14 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore Foundation, "[https://www.moore.org/newsroom/press-releases/2014/02/26/bvrio-wins-katerva-awards-in-the-economics-category Moore]"&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014 BVRio was nominated a "Climate Action Leader" by the [[R20 Regions of Climate Action]] as an acknowledgment for BVRio's work on the Green Finance Mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Avina Foundation, "[http://www.avina.net/por/7059/bvrio-ganha-titulo-de-climate-action-leader-pela-rede-r20/ Avina] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923180830/http://www.avina.net/por/7059/bvrio-ganha-titulo-de-climate-action-leader-pela-rede-r20/ |date=2015-09-23 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it received the Madeira Awards in 2014, and was shortlisted for awards from Yale University and UNDP in 2013/2014.

Backchannels can be both [[Language|verbal]] and [[non-verbal]] in nature, and are frequently [[phatic expression]]s, primarily serving a social or meta-conversational purpose, rather than involving substantial two-way communication.

== Definition and Use ==
The term was coined by [[Victor Yngve]] in 1970, in the following passage: "In fact, both the person who has the turn and his partner are simultaneously engaged in both speaking and listening.  This is because of the existence of what I call the back channel, over which the person who has the turn receives short messages such as 'yes' and 'uh-huh' without relinquishing the turn."&lt;ref&gt;Yngve, Victor. "On getting a word in edgewise," page 568. Papers from the Sixth Regional Meeting [of the] Chicago Linguistic Society, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "backchannel" was designed to imply that there are two channels of [[communication]] operating simultaneously during a conversation.&lt;ref&gt;White, Sheida. "Backchannels across cultures: A study of Americans and Japanese ." Language in society (1989): 59-76.&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant channel is that of the speaker who directs primary speech flow. The secondary channel of communication (or backchannel) is that of the listener which functions to provide ''continuers'' or ''assessments'',&lt;ref&gt;Li, Han. "Patterns of Backchannel Responses in Canadian-Chinese Conversations" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, TBA, San Francisco, CA, May 23, 2007 &lt;Not Available&gt;. 2009-02-04 &lt;http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p169308_index.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; defining a listener's comprehension and/or interest. Recent research, which can be seen below, has also suggested new terms for these two functions. They have proposed the term ''generic'' in place of ''continuers'' and ''specific'' in place of ''assessments''.

=== Applicability ===
Backchannel communication is present in all cultures and languages, though frequency and use may vary. Confusion or distraction can occur during an [[intercultural communication|intercultural]] encounter if participants from both parties are not accustomed to the same backchannel norms.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Nigel G. and Yaffa Al Bayyari. "American and Arab Perceptions of an Arabic Turn-Taking Cue." Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology (2010): 270-275.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Backchannels ==
Due to research development in recent years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iwasaki|first=S.|date=1997|title=The Northridge earthquake conversations: The floor structure and the ‘loop’ sequence in Japanese conversation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216697000702|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=28(6)|pages=661-693|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=English corpus linguistics: studies in honour of Jan Svartvik|last=Tottie|first=Gunnel|publisher=Longman|year=1991|isbn=|editor-last=Aijmer|editor-first=Karin|location=London|pages=254-271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  backchannel responses have been expanded to include sentence completions, requests for clarification, brief statements, and non-verbal responses and now fall into three categories: non-[[Word|lexical]], phrasal, and substantive.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Richard F. and Jina Lee. "Identifying units in interaction: Reactive tokens in Korean and English conversations." Journal of Sociolinguistics (2004): 380-407.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Non-Lexical Backchannels ===
A non-lexical backchannel is a vocalized sound that has little or no referential meaning but still verbalizes the listener's attention, and that frequently co-occurs with gestures. In [[English language|English]], sounds like ''uh-huh'' and ''hmm'' serve this role. Non-lexical backchannels generally come from a limited set of sounds not otherwise widely used in contentful conversational speech; as a result, they can be used to express support, surprise, or a need for clarification at the same time as someone else's conversational turn without causing confusion or interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Nigel|date=2006|title=Non-lexical conversational sounds in American English|url=|journal=Pragmatics &amp; Cognition|volume=14(1)|pages=129-182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English allows for the [[reduplication]], or repetition, of syllables within a non-lexical backchannel, such as in responses like ''uh-huh'', ''mm-hm'', or ''um-hm'', as well as for single-syllable backchanneling. In a study examining the use of two-syllable backchannels that focused on ''mm'' and ''mm-hm'', Gardner found that the two tokens are generally not identical in function, with ''mm'' being used more productively as a continuer, a weak acknowledgment token, and a weak assessment marker. In contrast, ''mm-hm'' is generally used as a backchannel to signal that the speaker is yielding their conversational turn and allowing the other speaker to maintain control of the conversational floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Rod|date=1997|title=The Conversation Object Mm: A Weak and Variable Acknowledging Token|url=|journal=Research on Language and Social Interaction|volume=30(2)|pages=131-156|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phrasal &amp; Substantive Backchannels ===
Phrasal backchannels most commonly assess or acknowledge a speaker's communication with simple words or phrases (for example, "Really?" or "Wow!" in English). Substantive backchannels consist of more substantial [[Turn-Taking|turn-taking]] by the listener and usually manifest as asking for clarification or repetitions.

One of the conversational functions of phrasal backchannels is to assess or appraise a previous utterance. Goodwin argues that this is the case for the phrasal backchannel ''oh wow'', where use of the backchannel requires a specific conversational context where something unexpected or surprising was said. Similarly, more substantive backchannels such as ''oh come on, are you serious?'' require a context where the speaker is responding to something exasperating or frustrating. In both of these cases, Goodwin argues that the backchannels focus only on addressing some aspect of the immediately proceeding utterance rather than the larger conversation itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Charles|date=1986|title=Between and within: Alternative sequential treatments of continuers and assessments|url=|journal=Human Studies|volume=9|pages=205-217|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they have a broad conversational distribution, appearing both in the middle of extended talk as well as at the end of longer conversational turns.

== Recent Research ==
More recent research has pushed back on the notion of backchannels, in which the listener's role is merely to receive information provided by the speaker. Bavelas, Coates, and Johnson&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bavelas|first=Janet B.|last2=Coates|first2=Linda|last3=Johnson|first3=Trudy|date=2000|title=Listeners as Co-Narrators|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=79|pages=941-952|via=EBSCOHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; put forth evidence that listeners' responses help shape the content of the speaker. They grouped acknowledgment tokens into two categories: generic and specific. Generic responses could be considered back channels and would include ''mm hm'' and ''yeah'', while specific responses would involve a reaction to the given context. Examples might include ''Oh!'' or a facial display of concern.

They transcribed students telling a fellow participant about a close call experience that they had had. With one group of participants, they had the listener perform another task to distract them from the story being told. The researchers asked independent reviewers to code the verbal and visual responses of the narration events as generic or specific. They also asked other independent reviewers to gauge the quality of the narration in each case.

They concluded that the responses from the distracted listeners included significantly fewer specific responses than from the undistracted listeners. In addition, they found that the quality of the narration was dramatically lower when the listener was distracted. Their basic contention was that listeners are co-narrators and help the storyteller in his or her narration. In other words, a storyteller tells a better story with an audience that is engaged than one that is not.

Tolins and Foxtree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tolins|first=Jackson|last2=Fox Tree|first2=Jean E.|date=2014|title=Addressee backchannels steer narrative development|url=|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=70|pages=152-164|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also published research demonstrating how backchannel communication influences speakers. Their research was specifically looking at how speakers respond to generic responses compared to specific responses.

[[File:Stenciled identity.jpg|thumb|right|The maple leaf is the symbol most associated with Canadian identity.]]
'''Canadian identity''' refers to the unique culture, characteristics and condition of being Canadian, as well as the many symbols and expressions that set [[Canada]] and Canadians apart from other peoples and cultures of the world.

Primary influences on the Canadian identity trace back to the arrival, beginning in the early seventeenth century, of [[France|French]] settlers in [[Acadia]] and the [[Quebec|St. Lawrence River Valley]] and English, Scottish and other settlers in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], the [[Great Britain|British]] conquest of [[New France]] in 1759, and the ensuing dominance of French and British culture in the gradual development of both an imperial and a national identity.

Throughout the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, [[First Nations]] played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, from their role in assisting exploration of the continent, the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] and inter-European power struggles to the creation of the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] people. Carrying through the 20th century and to the present day, Canadian aboriginal art and culture continues to exert a marked influence on Canadian identity.

The question of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated by two fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between [[English Canadian]]s and [[French Canadian]]s stemming from the French Canadian imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally close ties between [[English Canadians]] and the [[British Empire]], resulting in a gradual political process towards complete independence from the imperial power. With the gradual loosening of political and cultural ties to Britain in the twentieth century, immigrants from Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean have reshaped the Canadian identity, a process that continues today with the continuing arrival of large numbers of immigrants from non British or French backgrounds, adding the theme of [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multiculturalism to the debate]].&lt;ref&gt;John Ralston Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin: Canada at the End of the 20th Century,'' Toronto: Viking Canada, 1997, p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Resnick, ''The European Roots of Canadian Identity'', Peterborough: Broadview Press Ltd, 2005 p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy McGregor, ''Canadians: A Portrait of a Country and Its People'', Toronto: Viking Canada, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Canada has a diverse makeup of nationalities and cultures (see [[Canadian culture]]) and [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|constitutional protection]] for policies that promote multiculturalism rather than a single national myth.&lt;ref&gt;Saul,''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Basic models==
In defining a Canadian identity, some distinctive characteristics that have been emphasized are:

#The [[biculturalism|bicultural]] nature of Canada and the important ways in which English–French relations since the 1760s have shaped the Canadian experience.&lt;ref&gt;"Biculturalism", [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/biculturalism/ ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' (2010) online]&lt;/ref&gt;
#Canada's distinctive historical experience in resisting revolution and republicanism compared to the U.S., leading to less individualism and more support for government activism, such as [[wheat pools]] and the [[health care in Canada|health care system]].&lt;ref name="Lipset 1990"&gt;Lipset (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
#The relationship to the [[British parliamentary system]] and the [[British legal system]], the [[conservatism in Canada|conservatism]] associated with the [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalists]] and the pre-1960 French Canadians, have given Canada its ongoing collective obsession with "[[peace, order and good government]]".&lt;ref name="Lipset 1990"/&gt;
#The social structure of multiple ethnic groups that kept their identities and produced a ''[[cultural mosaic]]'' rather than a ''[[melting pot]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Magocsi, (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
#The influence of [[geography of Canada|geographical factors]] (vast area, coldness, [[nordicity|northness]]; [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence spine]]) together with the proximity of the United States have produced in the collective Canadian psyche what [[Northrop Frye]] has called the [[Garrison mentality|''garrison mind'' or ''siege mentality'']], and what novelist [[Margaret Atwood]] has argued is the Canadian preoccupation with ''survival''.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Atwood, ''Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Lieterature'', Toronto: House of Anansi Press Limited, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Herschel Hardin]], because of the remarkable hold of the ''siege mentality'' and the concern with survival, Canada in its essentials is "a public enterprise country." According to Hardin, the "fundamental mode of Canadian life" has always been, "the un-American mechanism of redistribution as opposed to the mystic American mechanism of market rule." Most Canadians, in other words, whether on the right or left in politics, expect their governments to be actively involved in the economic and social life of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;The typology is based on George A. Rawlyk, "Politics, Religion, and the Canadian Experience: A Preliminary Probe," in Mark A. Noll, ed. ''Religion and American Politics: From the Colonial Period to the 1980s.'' 1990. pp 259-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
{{main|History of Canada|Historiography of Canada}}

===Introduction===
Canada's large geographic size, the presence and survival of a significant number of indigenous peoples, the conquest of one European linguistic population by another and relatively open [[immigration policy]] have led to an extremely [[ethnic groups in Canada|diverse society]].

===Indigenous Peoples===
[[File:Edward S. Curtis Collection People 020.jpg|upright|thumb|Young girl from [[Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations]] in traditional tree fibre clothing - ca.1916]]
The indigenous peoples of Canada are divided among a large number of different ethnolinguistic groups, including the [[Inuit]] in the northern territory of [[Nunavut]], the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language groups in eastern Canada ([[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] in the [[Maritime Provinces]], [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]] of [[Quebec]] and [[Ojibway]] of the central region), the [[Iroquois]] of central Canada, the [[Cree]] of northern Ontario, Quebec and the Great Plains, peoples speaking the [[Athabaskan languages]] of Canada's northwest, the [[Salishan languages|Salishan]] language groups of [[British Columbia]] and other peoples of the Pacific coast such as the [[Tsimshian]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] and [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]].&lt;ref&gt;This list is not an exhaustive description of all [[aboriginal peoples in Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the indigenous peoples developed vibrant societies with complex economies, political structures and cultural traditions that were subsequently affected profoundly by interaction with the European populations. The [[Métis people (Canada)|Metis]] are an indigenous people whose culture and identity was produced by a fusion of First Nations with the French, Irish and Scottish [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] society of the north and west.

===French Settlement and the Struggle for Francophone Identity in Canada===
From the founding by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]] of [[Port Royal]] in 1605, (the beginnings of French settlement of [[Acadia]]) and the founding of [[Quebec City]] in 1608 by [[Samuel de Champlain]], Canada was ruled from and settled almost exclusively by [[France|French]] colonists. John Ralston Saul, among others, has noted that the east-west shape of modern Canada had its origins in decisions regarding alliances with the indigenous peoples made by early French colonizers or explorers such as [[Samuel de Champlain|Champlain]] or [[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes|De La Vérendrye]]. By allying with the [[Algonquin people|Algonquins]], for example, Champlain gained an alliance with the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] or Huron of today's Ontario, and the enmity of the [[Iroquois]] of what is now northern [[New York State]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deportation Grand-Pré.jpg|thumb|The [[Expulsion of the Acadians|deportation of the Acadians]] - 1893 painting, depicting an event in 1755.]]

Although English settlement began in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] in 1610, and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] was chartered in 1670, it was only with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 that France ceded to [[Great Britain]] its claims to mainland [[Nova Scotia]] and significant British colonization of what would become mainland Canada would begin. Even then, prior to the [[American Revolution]], Nova Scotia was settled largely by [[planters]] from [[New England]] who took up lands following the [[deportation of the Acadians|deportation of the French-speaking Acadian]] population, in 1755 in an event known in French to Acadians as ''Le Grand Dérangement'', one of the critical events in the formation of the Canadian identity.&lt;ref&gt;Saul describes the event as "one of the most disturbing" of Canada's "real tragedies", Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of French hegemony over [[New France]] the term ''Canadien'' referred to the French-speaking inhabitants of Canada.

The [[Seven Years' War]] between Great Britain and France resulted in the conquest of New France by the British in 1759 at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], an event that reverberates profoundly even today in the national consciousness of Quebecers. Although there were deliberate attempts made by the British to assimilate the French speaking population to English language and culture, most notably the 1840 [[Act of Union (1840)|Act of Union]] that followed the seminal report of [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]], British colonial policy for Canada on the whole was one which acknowledged and permitted the continued existence of French language and culture. Nevertheless, the efforts at assimilation of French Canadians, the fate of the French-speaking [[Acadian]]s and the revolt of the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|''patriotes'']] in 1837 would not be forgotten by their Québécois descendants. ''Je me souviens'', (English: "I remember"), the motto of Quebec, became the watchword of the Québécois. Determined to maintain their cultural and linguistic distinctiveness in the face of British colonial domination and massive immigration of English speaking people to the pre-Confederation Province of Canada, this survivalist determination is a cornerstone of current Québécois identity and much of the political discourse in Quebec. The English Canadian writer and philosopher John Ralston Saul also considers the [[Ultramontane]] movement of [[Catholicism]] as playing a pivotal and highly negative role in the development of certain aspects of Québécois identity.&lt;ref&gt;Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p 32 quote: "The Ultramontanes took French Canada off a relatively normal track of political and social evolution...The infection of healthy nationalism with a sectarianism that can still be felt in the negative nationalists was one of their accomplishments.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Settlement in Canada: Revolution, Invasion and Confederation===
For its part, the identity of English speaking Canada was profoundly influenced by another pivotal historic event, the [[American Revolution]]. Americans who remained loyal to the Crown and who actively supported the British during the Revolution saw their lands and goods confiscated by the new republic at the end of the war. Some 60,000 persons, known in Canada as [[United Empire Loyalists]] fled the [[United States]] or were evacuated after the war, coming to Nova Scotia and Quebec where they received land and some assistance from the British government in compensation and recognition for having taken up arms in defence of [[King George III]] and British interests. This population formed the nucleus for two modern Canadian provinces—Ontario and New Brunswick—and had a profound demographic, political and economic influence on Nova Scotia, [[Prince Edward Island]] and Quebec. Conservative in politics, distrustful or even hostile towards Americans, republicanism, and especially American republicanism,&lt;ref&gt;see MacGregor, ''Canadians'', at p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; this group of people marked the British of [[British North America]] as a distinctly identifiable cultural entity for many generations, and Canadian commentators continue to assert that the legacy of the Loyalists still plays a vital role in English Canadian identity. According to the author and political commentator [[Richard Gwyn]] while "[t]he British connection has long vanished...it takes only a short dig down to the sedimentary layer once occupied by the Loyalists to locate the sources of a great many contemporary Canadian convictions and conventions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gwyn]], ''John A: The Man Who Made Us'', 2007, Random House of Canada Ltd., p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Invasion of Quebec.tif|thumb|right|Defending [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Quebec from an American attack]] - 1860 painting, depicting a 1775 event]]

Canada was twice invaded by armed forces from the United States during the [[American Revolution]] and the [[War of 1812]]. The first invasion occurred in 1775, and succeeded in capturing [[Montreal]] and other towns in Quebec before being [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|repelled]] at [[Quebec City]] by a combination of British troops and local militia. During this invasion, the French-speaking ''Canadiens'' assisted both the invaders from the United Colonies and the defending British. The [[War of 1812]] also saw the invasion of American forces into what was then [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]], and important British victories at [[Battle of Queenston Heights|Queenston Heights]], [[Battle of Lundy's Lane|Lundy's Lane]] and [[Battle of Crysler's Farm|Crysler's Farm]]. The British were assisted again by local militia, this time not only the ''Canadiens'', but also the descendants of the Loyalists who had arrived barely a generation earlier. The Americans however captured control of Lake Erie, cutting off what is today western Ontario; they killed [[Tecumseh]] and dealt the Indian allies a decisive defeat from which they never recovered. The War of 1812 has been called "in many respects a war of independence for Canada".&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Divisions on a Ground: Essays on Canadian Culture'', 1982: House of Anansi Press, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The years following the War of 1812 were marked by heavy immigration from Great Britain to the Canadas and, to a lesser degree, the Maritime Provinces, adding new British elements (English, Scottish and Protestant Irish) to the pre-existing English-speaking populations. During the same period immigration of [[Catholic Irish]] brought large numbers of settlers who had no attachment, and often a great hostility, toward the imperial power. The hostility of other groups to the autocratic colonial administrations that were not based on democratic principles of [[responsible government]], principally the French-speaking population of Lower Canada and newly arrived American settlers with no particular ties to Great Britain, were to manifest themselves in the short-lived but symbolically powerful [[Rebellions of 1837]]. The term "Canadian", once describing a francophone population, was adopted by English-speaking residents of the Canadas as well, marking the process of converting 'British' immigrants into 'Canadians.'&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Susanna Moodie]], ''Roughing It in the Bush'', Toronto: McClelland &amp; Stewart Limited, 1970, p. 31: quote: "British mothers of Canadian sons!—learn to feel for their country the same enthusiasm which fills your hearts when thinking of the glory of your own. Teach them to love Canada...make your children proud of the land of their birth."&lt;/ref&gt;

The merger of the two [[The Canadas|Canadas]] in 1840, with political power divided evenly between the former Lower and Upper Canadas, created a political structure that eventually exacerbated tensions between the French and English-speaking populations and which would prove an enduring feature of Canadian identity. As the population of English-speaking and largely Protestant Canada West grew to surpass that of majority French-speaking Catholic Canada East, the population of Canada West began to feel that its interests were becoming subservient to the francophone population of Canada East. [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], founder of ''The Globe'' newspaper (forerunner of today's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'') and a [[Father of Confederation]] wrote that the position of Canada West had become "a base vassalage to French-Canadian Priestcraft." &lt;ref&gt;letter from George Brown, cited in Richard Gwyn, ''John A: The Man Who Made Us'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, the French Canadians distrusted the growing anti-Catholic 'British' population of Canada West and sought a structure that could provide at least some control over its own affairs through a Provincial legislature founded on principles of [[responsible government]].

[[File:Proclamation Canadian Confederation.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of Canadian Confederation (1867)]]

The [[Confederation (Canada)|union]] of the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into a federation in 1867 drew on all of the primary aspects of the Canadian identity: loyalty to Britain (there would be self-governance under a federal parliament, but no rupture from British institutions), limited but significant home rule for a French-speaking majority in the new Province of Quebec (and a longed for solution to English-French tensions), and a collaboration of British North Americans in order to resist the pull and the possible military threat from the United States. The republic to the south had just finished its [[Civil War (United States)|Civil War]] as a powerful and united nation with little affection for Britain or its colonial baggage strung along its northern border. So great was the perceived threat that even [[Queen Victoria]] thought, prior to Confederation, that it would be "impossible" for Britain to retain Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Prior to Confederation, Queen Victoria remarked on "...the impossibility of our being able to hold Canada, but we must struggle for it; and by far the best solution would be to let it go as an independent kingdom under an English prince." quoted in Stacey, C.P. ''British Military Policy in the Era of Confederation'', CHA Annual Report and Historical Papers 13 (1934), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their search for an early identity, [[English Canadian]]s relied heavily on loyalty and attachment to the [[British Empire]], a triumphalist attitude towards British role in the building of Canada, as evidenced in the lyrics of the informal anthem [[The Maple Leaf Forever]] and distrust or dislike of those who were not British or Protestant. John Ralston Saul sees in the influence of the [[Orange Order in Canada|Orange Order]] the counterpart of the Ultramontane movement among French Canadians, leading certain groups of English Canadian Protestants to provoke persecution of the Métis and suppress or resist francophone rights.&lt;ref&gt;Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Dominion===
After Confederation Canada became caught up in settlement of the west and extending the dominion to the Pacific Ocean. [[British Columbia]] joined Confederation in 1871. Residents of a [[Colony of British Columbia|British colony]] specifically established to forestall American territorial aspirations in the [[Fraser Valley]], British Columbians were no strangers to the implications of the American doctrine of [[Manifest Destiny]] nor the economic attractions of the United States. The construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], promised to British Columbia as an inducement to join the new dominion, became a powerful and tangible symbol of the nation's identity, linking the provinces and territories together from east to west in order to counteract the inevitable economic and cultural pull from the south.

The settlement of the west also brought to the fore the tensions between the English and French-speaking populations of Canada. The [[Red River Rebellion]], led by [[Louis Riel]], sought to defend the interests of French-speaking Métis against English-speaking Protestant settlers from Ontario. The controversial execution of [[Thomas Scott (Orangeman)|Thomas Scott]], a Protestant from Ontario, on Riel's orders and the furor that followed divided the new dominion along linguistic and religious lines. While [[Manitoba]] was created as a bilingual province in 1870 as a solution to the issue, the tensions remained, and would surface again in the [[Northwest Rebellion]] in the 1880s, when Riel led another rebellion against Ottawa.

The attention of the Dominion Government has been drawn to the fact that the children sent to Canada from England are street waifs and workhouse paupers, and that the professional philanthropists engaged in the work are largely prompted by mercenary and not charitable motives.

From the mid to late 19th century Canada had a policy of assisting immigrants from Europe, including city people and an estimated 100,000 unwanted "[[Home Children]]" from Britain. The modern descendants of these children have been estimated at five ''million'', contributing to Canada's identity as the "country of the abandoned".&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor, Canadians, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Offers of free land attracted farmers from Central and Eastern Europe to the prairies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://history.cbc.ca/history/?MIval=Section.html&amp;series_id=1&amp;episode_id=10&amp;chapter_id=3&amp;lang=E | work=CBC News | title=Pioneers Head West}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilization.ca/hist/advertis/ads1-01e.html Civilization.ca - Advertising for immigrants to western Canada - Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as large numbers of Americans who settled to a great extent in [[Alberta]]. Several immigrant groups settled in sufficient densities to create communities of a sufficient size to exert an influence on Canadian identity, such as [[Ukrainian Canadians]]. Canada began to see itself as a country that needed and welcomed people from countries besides its traditional sources of immigrants, accepting [[German-Canadian|Germans]], [[Polish-Canadian|Poles]], [[Dutch-Canadian|Dutch]] and Scandinavians in large numbers before the First World War.

At the same time, however, concerns regarding immigration from Asian sources revealed overtly xenophobic and racist attitudes among Canadians, particularly English Canadians on the Pacific coast. At the time for many Canadian identity, whatever it was to be, did not include non-Europeans. While inexpensive Chinese labour had been needed to complete the transcontinental railway, the completion of the railway led to questions of what to do with the workers who were now no longer needed. Further Chinese immigration was limited and then banned by a series of restrictive and racially motivated [[Head Tax (Canada)|dominion statutes]]. The [[Komagata Maru incident]] in 1914 revealed overt hostility towards would-be immigrants, mainly [[Sikh]]s from India, who attempted to land in [[Vancouver]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The main crisis regarding Canadian identity came in [[World War I]]. Canadians of British heritage were strongly in favor of the war effort, while those of French heritage, especially in [[Quebec]], showed far less interest. A series of political upheavals ensued, especially the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]. Simultaneously, the role of immigrants as loyal Canadians was contested, with large numbers of men of [[German Canadian|German]] or [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]] heritage temporarily stripped of voting rights or incarcerated in camps. The war helped define separate political identities for the two groups, and permanently alienated Quebec and the Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Granatstein, ''Broken promises: A history of conscription in Canada'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, World War I helped to establish a separate Canadian identity among Anglophoners, especially through the military experiences of the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] and the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] and the intense homefront debates on patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; (A [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|similar crisis]], though much less intense, erupted in World War II.)

In the 1920s, the Dominion of Canada achieved greater independence from Britain, notably in the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931. It remained part of the larger [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] but played an independent role in the [[League of Nations]]. As Canada became increasingly independent and [[sovereignty|sovereign]], its primary foreign relationship and point of reference gradually moved to the United States, the superpower with whom it shared a long border and major economic, social and cultural relationships.

[[File:Join the Team RCAF.jpg|thumb|upright| Join the Team! ([[Royal Canadian Air Force]]) - used from 1939 till 1945.]]
The Statute of Westminster also gave Canada [[Monarchy of Canada|its own monarchy]], which remains in [[personal union]] with [[Commonwealth realm|15 other countries]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. However, overt associations with British nationalism wound down after the end of the [[Military history of Canada during World War II|Second World War]], when Canada established its own citizenship laws in 1947. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, a number of symbols of the Crown were either removed completely (such as the [[Royal Mail]]) or changed (such as the [[Royal Arms of Canada]]).

In the 1960s, Quebec experienced the [[Quiet Revolution]] to modernize society from traditional Christian teachings. [[French-Canadian|Québécois]] nationalists demanded independence, and tensions rose until violence erupted during the 1970 [[October Crisis]]. In 1976 the [[Parti Québécois]] was elected to power in Quebec, with a nationalist vision that included securing French linguistic rights in the province and the pursuit of some form of sovereignty for Quebec, leading to a referendum in 1980 in Quebec on the question of [[sovereignty-association]], which was turned down by 59% of the voters. At the [[patriation of the Canadian Constitution]] in 1982, the Quebec premier did not sign it; this led to two unsuccessful attempts to modify the constitution so it would be signed, and another referendum on Quebec independence in 1995 which was turned down by a small majority of 50.6%.

In 1965 Canada adopted the [[flag of Canada|maple leaf flag]], after considerable debate and misgivings on the part of a large number of [[English Canadian]]s. Two years later the country celebrated the centennial of Confederation, with an [[Expo '67|international exposition]] in Montreal.

Legislative restrictions on immigration that had favoured British and other European immigrants were removed in the 1960s. By the 1970s immigrants increasingly came from [[Indo-Canadian|India]], [[Chinese Canadian|Hong Kong]], the [[African Canadian|Caribbean]] and [[Vietnamese Canadian|Vietnam]]. Post-war immigrants of all backgrounds tended to settle in the major urban centres, particularly [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]] and [[Vancouver]].

During his long tenure in the office (1968–79, 1980–84), Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] made social and cultural change his political goal for Canada, including the pursuit of an official policy on [[bilingualism]] and plans for significant constitutional change. The west, particularly the oil and gas-producing province of [[Alberta]], opposed many of the policies emanating from central Canada, with the [[National Energy Program]] creating considerable antagonism and growing western alienation.

===Modern times===
As for the role of history in national identity, the books of [[Pierre Berton]] and television series like ''[[Canada: A People's History]]'' have done much to spark the popular interest of Canadians in their history. Some commentators, such as Cohen, criticize the overall lack of attention paid by Canadians to their own history, noting a disturbing trend to ignore the broad history in favour of narrow focus on specific regions or groups.
{{quote|It isn't just the schools, the museums and the government that fail us. It is also the professional historians, their books and periodicals. As J.L. Granatstein and Michael Bliss have argued, academic historians in Canada have stopped writing political and national history. They prefer to write labour history, women's history, ethnic history, and regional history, among others, often freighted with a sense of grievance or victimhood. This kind of history has its place, of course, but our history has become so specialized, so segmented, and so narrow that we are missing the national story in a country that has one and needs to hear it.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, ''The Unfinished Canadian'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Much of the debate over contemporary Canadian identity is argued in political terms, and defines Canada as a country defined by its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values. To the political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], Canada should be conceived as a civic or political community, a community of citizens, one that contains many other kinds of communities within it. These include not only communities of ethnic, regional, religious, civic (the provincial and municipal governments) and civil associational sorts, but also national communities. Blattberg thus sees Canada as a multinational country and so asserts that it contains a number of nations within it. Aside from the various aboriginal First Nations, there is also the nation of francophone Quebecers, that of the anglophones who identify with English Canadian culture, and perhaps that of the Acadians.&lt;ref&gt;Blattberg, ''Shall We Dance? A Patriotic Politics for Canada'', Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with this, it is often asserted that Canadian government policies such as [[Health care in Canada|publicly funded health care]], higher taxation to distribute wealth, outlawing [[Capital punishment in Canada|capital punishment]], strong efforts to eliminate [[poverty in Canada]], an emphasis on [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multiculturalism]], imposing strict [[Gun politics in Canada|gun control]], leniency in regard to drug use and most recently legalizing [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] make their country politically and culturally different from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Darrell | last1 =Bricker |first2= John|last2 =Wright|title = What Canadians think-- about almost-- everything|publisher = Doubleday Canada,|year = 2005|isbn = 0-385-65985-7|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oCWHHfJhUvEC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Canadians&amp;pg=PT16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|pages = 8–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a poll that asked what institutions made Canada feel most proud about their country, number one was [[health care]], number two was the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], and number three was [[peacekeeping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queensu.ca/cora/_files/fc2010report.pdf |title= Focus Canada (Final Report) - Queen's University|publisher=Queen's University |date=2010  |author=The Environics Institute|format=pdf|page=7|accessdate= December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a CBC contest to name "[[The Greatest Canadian]]", the three highest ranking in descending order were the [[social democracy|social democratic]] politician and [[father of medicare]] [[Tommy Douglas]], the legendary cancer activist [[Terry Fox]], and the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]], responsible for instituting Canada's official policies of bilingualism and multiculturalism, which suggested that their voters valued [[left-wing politics|left-of-centre]] political leanings and community involvement.

Most of Canada's recent [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime ministers]] have been from Quebec, and thus have tried to improve relations with the province with a number of tactics, notably [[official bilingualism]] which required the provision of a number of services in both official languages and, among other things, required that all commercial packaging in Canada be printed in French and English. Prime Minister Pierre [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau's]] first legislative push was to implement the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism|Royal Commission on Bilingualism]] within the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official languages Act]] in 1969. Again, while this bilingualism is a notable feature to outsiders, the plan has been less than warmly embraced by many English Canadians some of whom resent the extra administrative costs and the requirement of many key federal public servants to be fluently bilingual.&lt;ref&gt;Sandford F. Borins. ''The Language of the Skies: The Bilingual Air Traffic Control Conflict in Canada'' (1983) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the widespread introduction of French-language classes throughout Canada, very few anglophones are truly bilingual outside of Quebec. Pierre Trudeau in regards to uniformity stated:

{{Quotation |Uniformity is neither desirable nor possible in a country the size of Canada. We should not even be able to agree upon the kind of Canadian to choose as a model, let alone persuade most people to emulate it. There are few policies potentially more disastrous for Canada than to tell all Canadians that they must be alike. There is no such thing as a model or ideal Canadian. What could be more absurd than the concept of an “all-Canadian” boy or girl? A society which emphasizes uniformity is one which creates intolerance and hate.&lt;ref name="Hines2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela Hines|title=The Trumping of America: A Wake Up Call to the Free World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9yFnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA180|date=August 2018|publisher=FriesenPress|isbn=978-1-5255-0934-6|page=180}} -Pierre Elliott Trudeau, as cited in The Essential Trudeau, ed. Ron Graham. (pp.16 – 20)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2013, more than 90% of Canadians believed that the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''  and the national flag were the top symbols of Canadian identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Daily — Canadian identity, 2013|url = http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/151001/dq151001a-eng.htm|website = www.statcan.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration to Canada===
Canada was the home for 'American' British [[United Empire Loyalists|Loyalists]] during and following the American Revolution, making much of Canada distinct in its unwillingness to embrace republicanism and populist democracy during the nineteenth century. Canada was also the destination for slaves from America via the [[Underground Railroad]] (The 'North Star' as heralded by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]); Canada was the refuge for American [[Canada and the Vietnam War|Vietnam draft-dodgers]] during the turbulent 1960s.

In response to a declining [[birth rate]], Canada has increased the [[per capita]] immigration rate to one of the [[Immigration to Canada#Immigration rate|highest in the world]]. The [[economic impact of immigration to Canada]] is discussed as being positive by most of the Canadian media and almost all Canadian politicians.

==Outsider perceptions==
&lt;!--Note: While relevant content can certainly be added to this section, please ensure that additions specifically address how Canadians ''respond'' to real or alleged stereotypes.--&gt;
A very common expression of Canadian identity is to ridicule American ignorance of things Canadian.&lt;ref name="Sheila Petty 2005 p. 58"&gt;Sheila Petty, et al. ''Canadian cultural poesis: essays on Canadian culture'' (2005) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

During his years with ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'', comic [[Rick Mercer]] produced a recurring segment, ''[[Talking to Americans]].'' Petty says, the segment "was extraordinarily popular and was initiated by viewer demand."&lt;ref name="Sheila Petty 2005 p. 58"/&gt;  Mercer would pose as a journalist in an American city and ask passers-by for their opinions on a fabricated Canadian news story. Some of the "stories" for which he solicited comment included the legalization of staplers, the coronation of [[Svend Robinson|King Svend]], the border dispute between Quebec and [[Chechnya]], the campaign against the Toronto Polar Bear Hunt, and the reconstruction of the historic "[[Peter Mansbridge|Peter Mann's Bridge]]". During the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] in the [[United States]], Mercer successfully staged a ''Talking to Americans'' segment in which presidential candidate [[George W. Bush]] gratefully accepted news of his endorsement by Canadian Prime Minister "Jean [[Poutine]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A. Gray, et al. ''Satire TV: politics and comedy in the post-network era'' (2009) p 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Herd Thompson and Stephen J. Randall, ''Canada and the United States: ambivalent allies'' (2002) p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

While Canadians may dismiss comments that they do not find appealing or stereotypes that are patently ridiculous, Andrew Cohen believes that there is a value to considering what foreigners have to say: "Looking at Canadians through the eyes of foreigners, we get a sense of how they see us. They say so much about us: that we are nice, hospitable, modest, blind to our achievements. That we are obedient, conservative, deferential, colonial and complex, particularly so. That we are fractious, envious, geographically impossible and politically improbable."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen refers in particular to the analyses of the French historian [[André Siegfried]],&lt;ref&gt;André Siegfried, ''Canada: An International Power; New and Revised Edition'', London: Jonathan Cape, 1949 quoted in Cohen, at pp. 35-37. Siegfried noted, among other things, the stark distinction between the identities of French and English-speaking Canadians.&lt;/ref&gt; the Irish born journalist and novelist [[Brian Moore (novelist)|Brian Moore]]&lt;ref&gt;Brian Moore, ''Canada''. New York: Time-Life Books, 1963, quoted in Cohen, ''The Unfinished Canadian''at pp. 31-33, commenting on the lack of a hero culture in Canada: "There are no heroes in the wilderness. Only fools take risks."&lt;/ref&gt; or the Canadian-born American journalist Andrew H. Malcolm.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew H. Malcolm, ''The Canadians: A Probing Yet Affectionate Look at the Land and the People'' Markham: Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside Ltd., 1985, quoted in Cohen, ''The Unfinished Canadian'' at pp. 44 to 47. "Canadians always seemed to be apologizing for something. It was so ingrained."&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Canadians and Identity in English Canada==
The Canadian philosopher and writer [[John Ralston Saul]] has expressed the view that the French fact in Canada is central to Canadian, and particularly to English Canadian identity:&lt;blockquote&gt;
It cannot be repeated enough that Quebec and, more precisely, francophone Canada is at the very heart of the Canadian mythology. I don't mean that it alone constitutes the heart, which is after all a complex place. But it is at the heart and no multiple set of bypass operations could rescue that mythology if Quebec were to leave. Separation is therefore a threat of death to anglophone Canada's whole sense of itself, of its self-respect, of its role as a constituent part of a nation, of the nature of the relationship between citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many Canadians believe that the relationship between the English and French languages is the central or defining aspect of the Canadian experience. Canada's [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|Official Languages Commissioner]] (the federal government official charged with monitoring the two languages) has stated, "[I]n the same way that race is at the core of what it means to be American and at the core of an American experience and class is at the core of British experience, I think that language is at the core of Canadian experience."&lt;ref&gt;Official Languages Commissioner [[Graham Fraser]] is quoted in the ''[[Hill Times]]'', August 31, 2009, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aboriginal Canadians and Canadian Identity==
[[File:RK 0908 9604 Spirit of Haida Gwaii the Jade Canoe.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'', sculpture by [[Bill Reid]] in [[Vancouver Airport]].]]Saul argues that Canadian identity is founded not merely on the relationship built of French/English pragmatic compromises and cooperation but rests in fact on a triangular foundation which includes, significantly, Canada's aboriginal peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; From the reliance of French and later English explorers on Native knowledge of the country, to the development of the indigenous Métis society on the Prairies which shaped what would become Canada, and the military response to their resistance to annexation by Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Saul ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' at p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; indigenous peoples were originally partners and players in laying the foundations of Canada. Individual aboriginal leaders, such as [[Joseph Brant]] or [[Tecumseh]] have long been viewed as heroes in Canada's early battles with the United States and Saul identifies [[Gabriel Dumont (Métis leader)|Gabriel Dumont]] as the real leader of the [[Northwest Rebellion]], although overshadowed by the better-known [[Louis Riel]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; While the dominant culture tended to dismiss or marginalize First Nations to a large degree, individual artists such as the British Columbia painter [[Emily Carr]], who depicted the [[Northwest Coast art|totem poles and other carvings]] of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast peoples]], helped turn the then largely ignored and undervalued culture of the first peoples into iconic images "central to the way Canadians see themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; First Nations art and iconography are now routinely integrated into public space intended to represent Canada, such as ''The Great Canoe"'', a sculpture by Haida artist [[Bill Reid]] in the courtyard of the [[Embassy of Canada, Washington, D.C.|Canadian embassy]] in [[Washington D.C.]] and its copy, ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'', at the apex of the main hall in the [[Vancouver Airport]].

===War of 1812===
The War of 1812 is often celebrated in Ontario as a British victory for what would become Canada in 1867.  The Canadian government spent $28 million on three years of bicentennial events, exhibits, historic sites, re-enactments, and a new national monument.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Trautsch, "Review of Whose War of 1812? Competing Memories of the Anglo-American Conflict," ''Reviews in History'' (review no. 1387) [http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1387 2013; Revise 2014], accessed: 10 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The official goal was to make Canadians aware that:
:Canada would not exist had the American invasion of 1812-15 been successful.
:The end of the war laid the foundation for Confederation and the emergence of Canada as a free and independent nation.
:Under the Crown, Canada’s society retained its linguistic and ethnic diversity, in contrast to the greater conformity demanded by the American Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada, [http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1442344384984/1442924691345 "The War of 1812, Historical Overview, Did You Know?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120083809/http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1442344384984/1442924691345 |date=2015-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 poll, 25% of all Canadians ranked their victory in the War of 1812 as the second most important part of their identity after free health care (53%).&lt;ref&gt;Trautsch, "Review of Whose War of 1812? Competing Memories of the Anglo-American Conflict"&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian historians in recent decades look at the war as a defeat for the First Nations of Canada, and also for the merchants of Montreal (who lost the fur trade of the Michigan-Minnesota area).&lt;ref&gt;"The Indians and the fur merchants of Montreal had lost in the end," says Randall White, ''Ontario: 1610-1985'' p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The British had a long-standing goal of building a "neutral" but pro-British Indian buffer state in the American Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight L. Smith, "A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 1989 61(2-4): 46-63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Francis M. Carroll|first=|title=A Good and Wise Measure: The Search for the Canadian-American Boundary, 1783-1842|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AjlS20Q5J8C&amp;pg=PA24|year=2001|publisher=U of Toronto Press|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They demanded a neutral Indian state at the peace conference in 1814 but failed to gain any of it because they had lost control of the region in the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] and the [[Battle of the Thames]] in 1813, where [[Tecumseh]] was killed. The British then abandoned the Indians south of the lakes. The royal elite of (what is now) Ontario gained much more power in the aftermath and used that power to repel American ideas such as democracy and republicanism, especially in those areas of Ontario settled primarily by Americans. Many of those settlers returned to the states and were replaced by immigrants from Britain who were imperial-minded.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Landon, ''Western Ontario and the American Frontier'' (1941) p. 44; see also Gerald M.

==Multiculturalism and identity==
{{Further|Multiculturalism in Canada}}
[[File:Canflagcartoon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Political cartoon on Canada's multicultural identity, from 1911.]]
Multiculturalism and the state of inter-ethnic relations in Canada is relaxed and tolerant, allowing ethnic or linguistic particularism to exist unquestioned. In metropolitan areas such as [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]], there is often a strong sense that multiculturalism is a normal and respectable expression of being Canadian. Canada is also considered a mosaic because of the multi-culturalism.

Supporters of Canadian multiculturalism will also argue that cultural appreciation of ethnic and religious diversity promotes a greater willingness to tolerate political differences, and multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity. Richard Gwyn has suggested that "tolerance" has replaced "loyalty" as the touchstone of Canadian identity.&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn, ''The Man Who Made Us What We Are'', p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, critics of Canada's multiculturalism argue that the country's "timid" attitude towards the assimilation of immigrants has actually weakened, not strengthened Canada's national identity through factionalism. Columnist and author Richard Gwyn expresses concern that Canada's sense of self may become so weak that it might vanish altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gwyn, ''Nationalism Without Walls: The Unbearable Lightness of Being Canadian'', Toronto: McClelland &amp; Stewart, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The indulgent attitude taken towards cultural differences is perhaps a side effect of the vexed histories of French-English and Aboriginal-settler relations, which have created a need for a civic national identity, as opposed to one based on some homogenous cultural ideal.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} On the other hand, concerns have been raised of the danger that "ethnic nationalism will trump civic nationalism"&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, ''The Unfinished Canadian''p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; and that Canada will leap "from colony to post-national cosmopolitan" without giving Canadians a fair chance of ever finding a centre of gravity or certain sense of Canadian identity.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, ''The Unfinished Canadian'' pp. 163-164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Resnick, quote: "But let us not make diversity a substitute for broader aspects of national identity or turn multiculturalism into a shibboleth because we are unwilling to reaffirm underlying values that make Canada what it has become. And those values, I repeat again, are largely European in their derivation, on both the English-speaking and French—speaking sides." at p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

For John Ralston Saul, Canada's approach of not insisting on a single national mythology or identity is not necessarily a sign of the country's weakness, but rather its greatest success,&lt;ref&gt;Saul, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; signalling a rejection of or evolution from the European mono-cultural concept of a national identity to something far more "soft" and less complex: &lt;blockquote&gt;The essential characteristic of the Canadian public mythology is its complexity. To the extent that it denies the illusion of simplicity, it is a reasonable facsimile of reality. That makes it a revolutionary reversal of the standard nation-state myth. To accept our reality—the myth of complexity—is to live out of sync with élites in other countries, particularly those in the business and academic communities.&lt;ref&gt;Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 2007, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] advised the creation of a new sub-ministerial cabinet portfolio with the title ''Canadian Identity'' for the first time in Canadian history, naming [[Jason Kenney]] to the position of [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and Canadian Identity]].

==The Role of Canadian Social Policy and Identity==
In ''Fire and Ice: The United States, Canada and the Myth of Converging Values'', the author, [[Michael Adams (author)|Michael Adams]], head of the [[Environics]] polling company seeks distinctions between Canadians and Americans using polling research performed by his company as evidence. Critics of the idea of a fundamentally "liberal Canada" such as [[David Frum]] argue that the Canadian drive towards a more noticeably leftist political stance is largely due to the increasing role that [[Quebec]] plays in the Canadian government (three of the last five elected Prime Ministers have been [[French-speaking Quebecer|Quebecers]], four if one includes Ontarian born Paul Martin). Quebec historically was the most conservative, religious and traditional part of Canada. Since the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s, however, it has become the most secular and [[social democratic]] region of Canada. However, it is noteworthy that many Western provinces (particularly [[Saskatchewan]] and [[British Columbia]]) also have reputations as supporting leftist and social democratic policies. For example, Saskatchewan is one of the few provinces (all in the West) to reelect social democratic governments and is the cradle of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] and its successor the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]]. Much of the energy of the early Canadian feminist movement occurred in [[Manitoba]].

By contrast, the Conservative provincial government of Alberta has frequently quarrelled with federal administrations perceived to be dominated by "eastern liberal elites." &lt;ref&gt;Panizza 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this is due to what Albertans feel were federal intrusions on provincial jurisdictions such as the [[National Energy Program]] and other attempts to 'interfere' with Albertan oil resources.

*The search for the Canadian identity often shows some whimsical results. To outsiders, this soul-searching (or, less charitably, navel-gazing) seems tedious or absurd, inspiring the [[Monty Python]] sketch ''Whither Canada?''
*In 1971, [[Peter Gzowski]] of [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]]'s ''[[This Country in the Morning]]'' held a competition whose goal was to compose the conclusion to the phrase: "As Canadian as..." The winning entry was "... possible, under the circumstances." It was sent in to the program by Heather Scott.&lt;ref name=globe96&gt;"On the origin of an aphorism", PETER GZOWSKI, 24 May 1996, [[The Globe and Mail]], page A15&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Robertson Davies]], one of Canada's best known [[novelists]], once commented about his homeland: "Some countries you love. Some countries you hate. Canada is a country you worry about."
*[[Pierre Berton]], a Canadian journalist and novelist, said: "A Canadian is someone who knows how to make love in a canoe without tipping it."{{verify quote|date=June 2016}}
*British novelist [[Douglas Adams]] said each country was like a particular type of person, and "Canada is like an intelligent 35 year old woman". [[United States|America]], on the other hand, is a "belligerent adolescent boy" and [[Australia]] is "[[Jack Nicholson]]".{{verify quote|date=June 2016}}
*Prime Minister Mackenzie King quipped that Canada was a country with "not enough history, too much geography".{{verify quote|date=June 2016}}
*According to [[John A. Macdonald]], the "special genius" of Canadian identity was that "it asks but one thing of its adherents: complete and total submission to the will of the state.  Once that has been accepted, everything else Canadian follows."  [[Pierre Trudeau]] largely agreed, saying that "To a Canadian, the only virtue is loyalty; the only sin, disobedience."{{verify quote|date=June 2016}}

Truman|inauguration]] in 1949 to broadcast the first-ever televised inaugural ceremony.&lt;ref name="washingtonian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wusa9"&gt;{{cite news | last = Leshan | first = Bruce | title = Charlie Brotman Has Been The Voice Of the Inaugural Parade Since 1949 | newspaper = WUSA-TV 9 | location = Washington DC | date = 2013-01-20 | url = http://www.wusa9.com/news/article/238922/158/Meet-The-Voice-Behind-The-Inaugural-Parade- | accessdate = 2013-01-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130217015329/http://www.wusa9.com/news/article/238922/158/Meet-The-Voice-Behind-The-Inaugural-Parade- | archivedate = 2013-02-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his graduation from the academy, Brotman worked as a disc jockey and sports announcer in [[Orlando, Florida]].&lt;ref name="washpost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tablet" /&gt; A 1956 meeting with Senators' owner [[Calvin Griffith]] led to him returning to his hometown of Washington to take the Senators announcing assignment. He later became the team's promotions director as well.&lt;ref name="tuscaloosa" /&gt;

In the 1960s, Brotman started his own public relations firm, Brotman&amp;#124;Winter&amp;#124;Fried, specializing in sports promotions.&lt;ref name="bwf"&gt;{{cite web | title = Bio: Charlie Brotman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board | publisher = Brotman&amp;#124;Winter&amp;#124;Fried | url = http://aboutbwf.com/content/charlie-brotman | accessdate = 2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (His firm was acquired by Sage Communications in 2011.&lt;ref name="sage" /&gt;) He continued to announce on Opening Day for the Senators each year until the team moved to [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas]] following the 1971 season. When the [[Washington Nationals]] relocated to the city in 2005, Brotman returned to his Opening Day duties.&lt;ref name="nationals"&gt;{{cite web | last = Seidel | first = Jeff | title = Brotman is back behind the microphone | publisher = Washington Nationals | date = 2005-04-01 | url = http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050401&amp;content_id=993435&amp;vkey=news_was&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=was | accessdate = 2013-01-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130201124827/http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050401&amp;content_id=993435&amp;vkey=news_was&amp;c_id=was&amp;fext=.jsp | archivedate = 2013-02-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brotman joined [http://linksp.com/ LINK Strategic Partners], a strategic communications and stakeholder engagement firm based in Washington, DC, as a [http://reingoldlink.com/article/Brotman-Press-Release-02-09-15.html senior advisor] in 2015. He advises the firm on its hyperlocal engagement work in DC and around the country.

Brotman has been inducted into 11 different Halls of Fame during his more than 50 years in public relations and announcing, including the Washington Hall of Fame, the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, Jock’s Hall of Fame, the Public Relations Society of America Hall of Fame, the Advertising Club of Washington Hall of Fame, the Greater Washington Fastpitch Softball Hall of Fame. His most recent induction took place in 2014 at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts for the Washington Tennis and Education Foundation Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citiopentennis.com/hall_of_fame/ WTEF Hall of Fame.] Citi Open.

==As an inauguration announcer==

Prior to taking on his inaugural duties, Brotman had been the stadium announcer at [[Griffith Stadium]], home of the [[History of the Washington Senators|Washington Senators]] baseball team.&lt;ref name="pic"&gt;{{cite web | last = Somanader | first = Tanya | title = Meet Charlie Brotman, the voice of the inaugural parade | publisher = The Presidential Inauguration Committee 2013 | date = 2013-01-16 | url = http://www.2013pic.org/blog/post/meet-charlie-brotman-the-voice-of-the-inaugural-parade | accessdate = 2013-01-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130223060010/http://www.2013pic.org/blog/post/meet-charlie-brotman-the-voice-of-the-inaugural-parade | archivedate = 2013-02-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brotman noted that on [[Opening Day]] 1956, Eisenhower was at the ballpark to throw out the [[ceremonial first pitch]]. Later that year, a White House staffer called Brotman and said Eisenhower was impressed with his work, and he wanted Brotman for the inauguration.&lt;ref name="tablet"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hoffman | first = Allison | title = Inaugural Parade’s Jewish Voice | newspaper = Tablet | date = 2013-01-18 | url = http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/121887/inaugural-parades-jewish-voice | accessdate = 2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staffer asked Brotman, "Will you charge a fee? Because our parade budget is very minimal." Brotman responded, "No, as a matter of fact, to be honest, I'd pay you for the honor."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news | last = Stephey | first = M.J. | title = Q&amp;A: Inaugural Parade Announcer | newspaper = Time | date = 2009-01-20 | url = http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1872598,00.html | accessdate = 2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brotman was behind the microphone for every inaugural parade in [[Washington, DC]], since 1957, when [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was sworn in for his second term.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kunkle | first = Fredrick | title = Inaugural parade’s announcer knows how to call ‘em as voice of former Washington Senators ballclub | newspaper = Washington Post | location = Washington DC | date = 2013-01-20 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/inauguration/inaugural-parades-announcer-knows-how-to-call-em-as-voice-of-old-senators-team/2013/01/20/945829ac-6279-11e2-b05a-605528f6b712_story.html | accessdate = 2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|second inauguration]] in 2013 was the 15th consecutive ceremony that Brotman has announced, and his 16th overall.&lt;ref name="sage"&gt;{{cite web | title = Sage Communications' Senior Advisor Charlie Brotman to Serve as the President's Announcer for the 57th Inaugural Parade | publisher = Sage Communications | date = 2013-01-14 | url = http://www.aboutsage.com/news/sage-communications-senior-advisor-charlie-brotman-serve-presidents-announcer-57th-inaugural-pa | accessdate = 2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the presidency of [[George W. Bush]], Brotman also served as the announcer at [[tee ball]] games on the South Lawn of the White House.&lt;ref name="whitehouse"&gt;{{cite news | title = White House South Lawn Tee Ball  | publisher = The White House (archived) | date = 2006-07-30 | url = https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/07/20060724-1.html | accessdate = 2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Donald Trump]]'s Presidential Inauguration Committee ended Brotman's reign as announcer, instead picking Steve Ray, a Trump supporter, for the [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|58th Presidential Inauguration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/08/politics/donald-trump-charles-brotman-inauguration-announcer/index.html|title=Trump drops inauguration announcer who's done them all since Eisenhower|last=CNN|first=Eric Bradner|website=CNN|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brotman was, however, selected to welcome the National Organizers for the [[2017 Women's March|Women's March on Washington]] on January 21, 2017 - the day following the Inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ABC News|title=Women's March on Washington 2017 (FULL EVENT) {{!}} ABC News|date=2017-01-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp1FyjB8WXQ|accessdate=2017-01-22|format=YouTube Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chilean Swedes''' are Chilean immigrants in Sweden and citizens of Sweden who are of Chilean ancestry.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Population==
It is estimated that some 50,000 people have Chilean background (first and second generation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3993&amp;artikel=5642418|year=2012|quote=I dag beräknas det bo ungefär 50 000 med chilensk bakgrund (första och andra generationens invandrare) i Sverige. Källa: Nationalencyklopedin, Migrationsverket, SCB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier estimations were 45,000 (2008).

==History==

===Origins===

Before the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]], there were some 90 Chileans in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fokus.se/2010/03/en-svensk-katastrof/&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other Latin American countries, Chile had a tradition of democratic rule and relative political stability. The early stages of mass migration were mainly consistent of politicians, militants, intellectuals and other left-leaning elements seeking political refuge, but recent arrivals usually involve working-class Chileans in search of better living conditions for themselves and their families. Today many live in the bigger cities such as [[Gothenburg]], [[Malmö]] and [[Stockholm]]. Chilean Swedes are the largest and most prominent group among Latin American communities residing in Sweden.

===The Coup 1973===
Chilean people started immigrating in the 1970s in order to escape the dictatorship of [[Augusto Pinochet]]. Sweden was known to be a social democratic country and the government allowed refugees to come to Sweden. But for many the time adapting to the new country was difficult. Language barriers, colder weather and monopolies on TV, radio and alcohol sales, for example, were a huge contrast to Chile. Many who came to Sweden continued to support the overthrown government of [[Salvador Allende]]. When Sweden was scheduled to play a [[Davis Cup]] tennis match against Chile in 1975, a large protest movement instigated by the Chilean diaspora sought to [[boycott]] the match and have it cancelled. The Hoola Bandoola Band even wrote a song titled "Stoppa matchen" ("Stop the match"). Almost 10,000 people demonstrated against the decision to play the match, which was eventually held as scheduled, but without spectators. When [[Milton Friedman]] received his Nobel Prize in 1976, similar protests organized both by Swedes and Chileans were once again seen on the streets.

===After the coup===
During the 1980s, after Pinochet's economic reforms many poverty-stricken Chileans left their home country in hope to seek better opportunities in Sweden, where there was already a sizable presence of Chileans arrived in the previous decade. Some helped the newly arrived so they could integrate in the Swedish society. For a short period immigration from Chile increased after the 1970s and once again peaked. Today Chile is considered to be democratic and prosperous by Latin American standards, which has decreased immigration after the installation of a democratic government in 1990. Chileans who want to visit Sweden can stay three months without a visa thanks to diplomatic agreements between the countries. On the other hand, for Chileans who want to stay permanently in Sweden, it has become much more difficult for them to gain a permanent visa.

Since the 1990s, migration from Chile to Sweden has declined following restoration of Chilean democracy and the [[economy of Chile]] growing more successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/30063/1/gupea_2077_30063_1.pdf|title=Från utvandringsland till invandringsland|publisher=School of Public Administration|language=Swedish|author=Osvaldo Salas|date=2009|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is considered today to be one of the most well-integrated within Swedish [[society]]. This perception of assimilation resulted in [[Sveriges Radio]] (Swedish Public Radio) to announce that they would stop broadcasting news in Spanish in 2005 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060523034619/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/sisuradio/nyheter/amnessida.asp?programID=185&amp;Nyheter=1&amp;grupp=2365&amp;artikel=703652]. Most Chilean Swedes are irreligious or atheist, as the first wave consisted mainly of [[Marxism|Marxist]] supporters of Allende, whereas practicing Catholics tended to support Pinochet. Some are Catholics and celebrate Easter, [[Christmas]] and [[New Year]] in the same days as the Swedes. They are the largest Latin American group in Sweden and celebrate their culture in ways such as commemorating [[Chilean Independence Day]] or Fiestas Patrias. Thus they keep alive Chilean folk traditions such as the [[cueca]] and [[huaso]] costumes.

=== First settlers ===
The first Chinese to settle in South Africa were prisoners, usually [[Debtors' prison|debtors]], exiled from [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] to their then newly founded [[Cape Colony|colony]] at [[Cape Town]] in 1660.  Originally the Dutch wanted to recruit Chinese settlers to settle in the colony as farmers, thereby helping establish the colony and create a tax base so the colony would be less of a drain on Dutch coffers. However the Dutch failed to find anyone in the Chinese community in Batavia who was prepared to volunteer to go to such a far off place.  The first Chinese person recorded by the Dutch to arrive in the Cape was a convict by the name of ''Ytcho Wancho'' (almost certainly a Dutch version of his original Chinese name). There were also some free Chinese in the [[Dutch Cape Colony]]. They made a living through fishing and farming and traded their produce for other required goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elphick|first1=Richard|last2=Giliomee|first2=Hermann|title=The Shaping of South African Society, 1652–1840.|date=1979|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=9780819562111|page=223|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=vZqJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1660 until the late 19th century the number of Chinese people in the Cape Colony never exceeded 100.&lt;ref name="Yap1996"/&gt;{{rp|5–6}}

Chinese people began arriving in large numbers in South Africa in the 1870s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article4168245.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=We agree that you are black South African court tells Chinese | first=Jonathan | last=Clayton | date=19 June 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; through to the early 20th century initially in hopes of making their fortune on the diamond and gold mines in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] and the [[Witwatersrand Basin|Witwatersrand]] respectively. Most were independent immigrants mostly coming from [[Guangdong Province]] then known as Canton.

The Chinese community in South Africa grew steadily throughout the remainder of the 19th century, bolstered by new arrivals from China. The [[Anglo-Boer War]], fought between 1898 and 1902, pushed some Chinese South Africans out of the Witwatersrand and into areas such as [[Port Elizabeth]] and [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] in the [[Eastern Cape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Karen L.|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/articles_papers/kleios/xxvi-1994-chinese-in-SA.htm|title=The Chinese in South Africa: a preliminary overview to 1910|publisher=Sahistory.org.za|date=1994|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626224153/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/articles_papers/kleios/xxvi-1994-chinese-in-SA.htm|archivedate=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas recorded to have Chinese populations moving in to settle at the time include [[Pageview, Gauteng|Pageview]] in Johannesburg that was declared a non-white area in the late 1800s and known as the "Malay Location"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection|title=Nation Formation and Social Cohesion: An Enquiry into the Hopes and Aspirations of South Africans|date=2015|publisher=Real African Publishers|isbn=9781920655747|page=148|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=ng4iBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=6 January 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale immigration into South Africa during this time was prohibited by the Transvaal Immigration Restriction Act of 1902 and the Cape Chinese Exclusion Act of 1904.  A host of discriminatory laws similar to the anti-Chinese laws that sought to restrict trade, land ownership and citizenship were also enacted during this time. These laws were largely made popular by a general [[Yellow Peril|anti-Chinese feeling]] across the [[western world]] during the early 1900s and the arrival of over 60,000 [[indenture]]d Chinese miners after the [[Second Boer War|second Anglo-Boer War]].&lt;ref name="Park2012"/&gt;

These early immigrants arriving between the 1870s and early 1900s are the ancestors of most of South Africa's first Chinese community and number some 10,000 individuals today.&lt;ref name="Park2012"/&gt;

==== Contracted gold miners (1904–1910) ====
[[File:Punch 1903 - Chinese Paul.jpg|right|thumb|220px| ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon, 1903; The [[Randlord|Rand mine-owners']] employment of [[Chinese South Africans#Contracted gold miners (1904-1910)|Chinese labour]] on the [[Witwatersrand Basin|Transvaal gold mines]] was controversial and contributed to the Liberal victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 elections]].]]
[[File:Ten Years of Toryism.jpg|thumb|Liberal Party poster for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 UK elections]], claiming that ten years of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]] rule means "South Africa for the Chinese", and a line of Chinese workers.]]
[[File:Chinese Mine Workers- South Africa.jpg|right|thumb|250px| Around 4,200 miners at the Simmer and Jack mine on the Witwatersrand, taken between 1904 and 1910.]]
There were many complicated reasons why the British chose to import Chinese labour to use on the mines. After the Anglo-Boer War, production on the gold mines of the Witwatersrand was very low due to a lack of labour. The British government was eager to get these mines back online as quickly as possible as part of their overall effort to rebuild the war-torn country.

Because of the war, unskilled black laborers had returned to rural areas and were more inclined to work on rebuilding infrastructure as mining was more dangerous. Unskilled white labour was being phased out because it was deemed too expensive.  The British found recruiting and importing labour from east Asia the most expedient way to solve this problem.&lt;ref name="Yap1996"/&gt;{{rp|104}}

Between 1904 and 1910, over 63,000 contracted miners were brought in to work the mines of the Witwatersrand.  Most of these contractors were recruited from the provinces of Chihli ([[Zhili Province|Zhili]]), Shantung ([[Shandong]]) and Honan ([[Henan]]) in China.&lt;ref name="Yap1996"/&gt;{{rp|105}}  They were repatriated after 1910,&lt;ref name="Park2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2008/06/19/in-south-africa-chinese-is-the-new-black/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=In South Africa, Chinese is the New Black | date=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of strong White opposition to their presence, similar to [[Yellow Peril|anti-Asian sentiments]] in the western United States, particularly [[California]] at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nativism (politics)#Anti-Chinese nativism]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a myth that the contracted miners brought into South Africa at this time are the forefathers of much of South Africa's Chinese population.&lt;ref name="Yap1996"/&gt;{{rp|103–104}}

[[Herbert Hoover]], who would become the 31st U.S. President, was a director of [[Chinese Engineering and Mining Corporation]] (CEMC) when it became a supplier of [[coolie]] (Asian) labor for South African mines.&lt;ref name="Liggett 1930"&gt;[[Walter Liggett]], ''The Rise of Herbert Hoover'' (New York, 1932)&lt;/ref&gt; The first shipment of 2,000 coolies arrived in Durban from [[Qinhuangdao]] in July 1904. By 1906, the total number of Chinese coolies increased to 50,000, almost entirely recruited and shipped by CEMC. When the living and working conditions of the laborers became known, public opposition to the scheme grew and questions were asked in the British Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-winston-churchill/1906|title=Mr Winston Churchill: speeches in 1906 (Hansard)|publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was abandoned in 1911.

The mass importation of Chinese labourers to work on the gold mines contributed to the fall from power of the [[Unionist Government 1895–1905|conservative government]] in the United Kingdom.  However, it did stimulate to the economic recovery of South Africa after the Anglo-Boer War by once again making the mines of the Witwatersrand the most productive gold mines in the world.&lt;ref name="Yap1996"/&gt;{{rp|103}}

===Passive resistance campaign (1906–1913)===
[[File:Chinese Passive Resistance leader.jpg|thumb|Chinese passive resistance leaders circa 1906]]

=== Apartheid era (1948–1994) ===
As with other non-White South Africans, the Chinese suffered from discrimination during [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]], and were often classified as [[Coloureds]],&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7461099.stm|work=BBC News|title=S Africa Chinese 'become black'|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but sometimes as [[Asians in South Africa|Asians]], a category that was generally reserved for [[Indian South Africans]]. Today this segment of the South African Chinese population numbers some 10,000 individuals.&lt;ref name="Park2009"/&gt;

Under the [[apartheid]]-era [[Population Registration Act, 1950]], Chinese South Africans were deemed "Asiatic", then "Coloured", and finally:

Chinese South Africans, along with Black, Coloured and Indian South Africans, were forcefully removed from areas declared "Whites only" areas by the government under the [[Group Areas Act]] in 1950.

In 1966 the [[South African Institute of Race Relations]] described the negative effects of apartheid legislation on the Chinese community and the resulting [[brain drain]]:

{{blockquote|No group is treated so inconsistently under South Africa's race legislation. Under the [[Immorality Act]] they are Non-White.

But in Pretoria, only the consul-general's staff may use White buses .. Their future appears insecure and unstable. Because of past and present misery under South African laws, and what seems like more to come in the future, many Chinese are emigrating. Like many Coloured people who are leaving the country, they seem to favour [[Canada]].

With the establishment of ties between [[apartheid South Africa]] and [[Taiwan]] (officially the Republic of China), Taiwanese (as well as some Hong Kong Chinese) started migrating to South Africa from the late 1970s onwards. Due to apartheid South Africa's desire to attract their investment in South Africa and the many poorer [[Bantustans]] within the country, they were exempt from many apartheid laws and regulations. This created an odd situation whereby South Africans of Chinese descent continued to be classified as Coloureds or Asians, whereas the Taiwanese Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xitem=123749&amp;ctnode=1360&amp;mp=1|title=Premier Sun visits four African countries|journal=Taiwan Review|date=5 January 1980|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207175931/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xitem=123749&amp;ctnode=1360&amp;mp=1|archivedate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and certain other east Asian [[expatriate]]s (esp. South [[Koreans]] and Japanese) were considered "[[honorary whites]]"&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt; and enjoyed most, if not all, of the rights accorded to [[White South Africans]].&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"/&gt;

The South African government also offered a number of economic incentives to investors from Taiwan seeking to set up factories and businesses in the country. These generous incentives ranged from "paying for relocation costs, subsidised wages for seven years, subsidised commercial rent for ten years, housing loans, cheap transport of goods to urban areas, and favourable exchange rates".&lt;ref name="Park2012"/&gt;

In 1984, South African Chinese, now increased to about 10,000, finally obtained the same official rights as the Japanese in South Africa, that is, to be treated as whites in terms of the Group Areas Act.&lt;ref name=Osada/&gt; The arrival of the Taiwanese resulted in a surge of the ethnic Chinese population of South Africa, which climbed from around 10,000 in the early 1980s to at least 20,000 in the early 1990s. Many Taiwanese were entrepreneurs who set up small companies, particularly in the textile sector, across South Africa. It is estimated that by the end of the early 1990s Taiwanese industrialists had invested $2 billion (or $2.94 billion in 2011 dollars)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuringworth.com/ Measuring Worth], Relative Value of a U.S. Dollar Amount - [[Consumer Price Index]], retrieved on the 26 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in South Africa and employed roughly 50,000 people.&lt;ref name="Yap1996"/&gt;{{rp|427}}

In the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century many of the Taiwanese left South Africa partly due to official recognition of the [[People's Republic of China]] and a post apartheid [[Crime in South Africa|crime wave]] that swept the country. Numbers dropped from a high of around 30,000 Taiwanese citizens in the mid-1990s to the current population of approximately 6,000 today.&lt;ref name="Park2009"/&gt;

===Post-Apartheid===
Following the end of [[apartheid]] in 1994, mainland Chinese began immigrating to South Africa in large numbers, increasing the Chinese population in South Africa to an estimated 300,000-400,000 in 2015.&lt;ref name="journaldiaspora"/&gt; In Johannesburg, in particular, a new [[Chinatown]] has emerged in the eastern suburbs of [[Cyrildene]] and [[Bruma, Gauteng|Bruma Lake]], replacing the declining one in the city centre. A Chinese housing development has also been established in the small town of [[Bronkhorstspruit, Gauteng|Bronkhorstspruit]], east of [[Pretoria]],{{full citation needed|date=August 2013}} as well as a massive new “city” in development in Johannesburg.

====Black Economic Empowerment ruling====
Under [[apartheid]], some Chinese South Africans were discriminated against in various forms by the apartheid government. However, they were originally excluded from benefiting under the [[Black Economic Empowerment]] (BEE) programmes of the new [[South African government]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; This changed in mid-2008 when, in a case brought by the Chinese Association of South Africa, the Pretoria division of the [[High Court of South Africa]] ruled that Chinese South Africans who were [[South African nationality law|South African citizens]] before 1994, as well as their descendants, qualify as previously disadvantaged individuals as [[Coloureds]],&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt; and therefore are eligible to benefit under BEE and other [[affirmative action]] policies and programmes. The Chinese Association of South Africa was represented by human rights lawyer [[George Bizos]] in court during the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese qualify for BEE|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Chinese-qualify-for-BEE-20080618|website=News24|accessdate=15 December 2015|date=18 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chinese South Africans who immigrated to the country after 1994 will be ineligible to benefit under the policies. In September 2015, [[Department of Trade and Industry (South Africa)|Department of Trade and Industry]] deputy director general Sipho Zikode clarified who the ruling was meant to benefit. He said that not all Chinese in South Africa were eligible for BEE. He confirmed that only Chinese who were South African citizens prior to 1994, numbering "about 10,000" were eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mashego|first1=Penelope|title=State defends BEE benefits for Chinese|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/2015/09/18/state-defends-bee-benefits-for-chinese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918180214/http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/2015/09/18/state-defends-bee-benefits-for-chinese|archivedate=2015-09-18|website=BdLive|accessdate=20 December 2015|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration of Mainland Chinese==
[[File:Piketberg.jpg|right|thumb|200px| A "China shop" in [[Porterville, Western Cape|Porterville]], [[Western Cape]], South Africa in 2010.  Since the early 2000s many such shops, usually general dealers, have opened up in rural areas by Chinese immigrants from mainland China.]]
The immigration of [[mainland Chinese]], by far the largest group of Chinese in South Africa, can be divided into three periods. The first group arrived in the late 1980s and early 1990s along with the Taiwanese immigrants. Unlike the Taiwanese immigrants, lacking the capital to start larger firms, most established small businesses. Although becoming relatively prosperous a large number of this group left South Africa, either back to China or to more developed Western countries, around the same time and for much the same reason as the Taiwanese immigrants left. The second group, arriving mostly from [[Jiangsu]] and [[Zhejiang]] provinces in the 1990s, were wealthier, better educated, and very entrepreneurial. The latest and ongoing group began arriving after 2000 and primarily made up of small traders and peasants from [[Fujian]] province.&lt;ref name="Park2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. J. Park and A. Y. Chen, "Intersections of race, class and power: Chinese in post-apartheid Free State", unpublished paper presented at the South African Sociological Association Congress, Stellenbosch, July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many Chinese from other regions in China. As of 2013, there were 57 different regional Chinese associations operating in the Cyrildene Chinatown.&lt;ref name=Ufrieda&gt;{{cite web|last=Ho|first=Ufrieda|title=The arch angle on booming Chinatown|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-07-12-the-arch-angle-on-booming-chinatown|website=Mail and Guardian Online|date=12 July 2013|accessdate=6 January 2016|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714131834/http://mg.co.za/article/2013-07-12-the-arch-angle-on-booming-chinatown|archivedate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Chinese South African community is a most law-abiding community that has maintained a low profile in modern South Africa, there is speculation that local criminal gangs in South Africa barter [[abalone]] illegally with Chinese nationals and [[Triad (underground society)|triad societies]] in exchange for chemicals used in the production of drugs, reducing the need for the use of money and hence avoiding difficulties associated with [[money laundering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capeargus.co.za/?fSectionId=3571&amp;fArticleId=vn20090411065235212C189274|title=Cape Argus|publisher=Cape Argus|date=11 April 2009|accessdate=29 July 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|last=Gastrow|first=Peter|url=https://issafrica.s3.amazonaws.com/site/uploads/paper48.pdf|title=Triad societies and Chinese organised crime in South Africa, Occasional Paper No 48|publisher=[[Institute for Security Studies|ISS Africa]]|date=2 February 2001|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3187">'''Constructive Program''' (CP) is a term coined by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] to describe one of the two branches of his [[satyagraha]], the other being some form on nonviolence resistance, e.g. [[civil disobedience]], sometimes referred to as "obstructive program".  CP is a way of carrying out a struggle through community and self-improvement by building structures, systems, processes, and resources that are alternatives to oppression and promote self-sufficiency and unity in the resisting community.

Though not as well known as his nonviolence resistance programs, Gandhi recognized the value of constructive program and used it successfully as early as the first year of his campaigns in South Africa, 1894. In fact, the value of CP in the struggle for the independence of India cannot be overemphasized, as he described civil disobedience as "an aid to constructive effort." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=M. K.|title=Constructive Programme: Its Meaning and Place|year=1948|publisher=Navajivan Publishing House, page 1|location=Ahmedabad|url=https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/mahatma-gandhi-books/constructive-programme-its-meaning-and-place|edition=2nd|authorlink=Mahatma Gandhi|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi wrote to his friend and supporter, Jamnalal Bajaj, saying, "My real politics is constructive work." &lt;ref&gt;Nayar, Pyarelal and Sushila, (1991). ''In Gandhi's Mirror''. Dehli: Oxford University Press, page 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary nonviolent struggles often lack constructive program, which could easily be integrated and enable them to be proactive, maintain continuity of effort when direct resistance is not possible, and convince the public and opposition that they are not simply disruptive but have the capacity to build as well.  Most importantly constructive program can build alternative institutions so that a successful insurrection does not lead merely to a power vacuum that lets oppression back in, as for example in Egypt after the otherwise successful overthrow of President Mubarak in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Nagler, Michael, (2014).

'''''Fatal Misconception: The Struggle to Control World Population''''' is a 2008 book by Matthew Connelly, an associate professor of history at [[Columbia University]].

Efforts to [[birth control|control population]] have been controversial, and Connelly argues that "the road to controlling [[population growth]] in the 20th century was [[the road to hell is paved with good intentions|paved with good intentions]] and unpleasant policies that did not work".  For example, millions of [[intrauterine contraceptive]] devices were exported to poor countries although they were known to cause infections and sterility.&lt;ref name=kristof/&gt;

==Reception==

===Book reviews===

[[Nicholas Kristof]] reviewed the book favorably for ''[[The New York Times]]'', but concluded: "It’s certainly fair of Connelly to dredge up the forced sterilizations, the casual disregard for injuries caused by IUDs, the racism and sexism and all the rest — but we also need to remember that all that is history. The family planning movement has corrected itself, and today it saves the lives of women in poor countries and is central to efforts to reduce poverty worldwide. If we allow that past to tarnish today’s efforts by family planning organizations, women in poor countries will be doubly hurt."&lt;ref name=kristof&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/books/review/Kristof-t.html|title = Birth Control for Others|date = March 23, 2008|accessdate = February 11, 2014|last = Kristof|first = Nicholas|authorlink = Nicholas Kristof}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reihan Salam]] reviewed the book for the ''[[New York Sun]]'', where he raised some cautionary points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/birth-control/73199/|title = Book Review: Fatal Misconception by Matthew Connelly|last = Salam|first = Reihan|authorlink = Reihan Salam|date = March 19, 2008|accessdate = February 11, 2014|publisher = ''[[New York Sun]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]], executive director of the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] (IEET) reviewed the book for ''[[Times Higher Education]]''. Hughes concluded: "Connelly's pessimism that international institutions can ever be as accountable as national governments is hopefully unwarranted. It seems likely that transnational bodies will be increasingly important in ensuring the health and wellbeing of the nine or ten billion people the planet will soon hold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/402168.article|title = Fatal Misconception: The Struggle to Control World Population|last = Hughes|first = James|authorlink = James Hughes (sociologist)|publisher = ''[[Times Higher Education]]''|date = May 29, 2008|accessdate = February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helen Epstein]] reviewed the book favorably for the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', concluding: "The population control movement was a small part of US foreign policy, but its history reminds us of the point American policymakers keep missing: universal human rights are not a luxury. They are themselves the goals we should be seeking."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/review/2008_08_18.html |title=The Strange History of Birth Control |last=Epstein |first=Helen |authorlink=Helen Epstein |date=August 18, 2008 |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |publisher=''[[New York Review of Books]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222201504/http://www.powells.com/review/2008_08_18.html |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana Wyndham reviewed the book for the ''[[Australian Review of Public Affairs]]'', concluding: "Connelly’s apparent balance—he opposes both pro- and anti-population control excesses—means he is more likely to reach and convince a broader audience to accept his argument that global population control services are bad and should cease. A major worry is that this book’s catalogue of failed population control programs will be used by ‘Pro-life’ groups who want to reinstate the 1984 Mexico City policy ban which, by denying aid, spread sexually transmitted diseases and increased pregnancy-related deaths. If, as he believes, ‘the heroic age of population control is over’ (p.&amp;nbsp;16), life on this planet will end because there is only a finite supply of water, food and natural resources. There is wisdom in the family planning slogan: ‘Hope is not a method’."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2009/04/wyndham.html|title = Forget Population Control – All You Need is Love|date = April 2009|accessdate = February 11, 2014|publisher = ''[[Australian Review of Public Affairs]]''|last = Wyndham|first = Diana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shaikh are a [[Muslim]] community found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in [[India]]. They are part of the larger [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] community of [[South Asia]]. Included within the Shaikh community are the [[Shaikhda]] of [[Bharuch district]] and the Sodagar of [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI Part Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1278-1282&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The word Shaikh in [[Arabic]] means a tribal elder or headman.

The term Shaikh can cover a community of no definite origin, since the name has been used by any individuals of wide background. Mostly influential people or poor farmers converted by Sufi saints used to adopt Shaikh title.

They played a key role in the early [[Islamic]] history of [[Gujarat]], serving as courtiers and administrators for the [[Gujarat Sultanate|Sultans of Gujarat]] and later [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers. After the breakup of the [[Mughal Empire]], they became rulers of a number of states in the [[Kathiawar]] region, with [[Mangrol, Kathiawar|Mangrol]] being the most important.

The community is found mainly in [[Ahmedabad district|Ahmedabad]], [[Bharuch]], [[Godhra]], [[Vadodara]], [[Rajkot]], [[Junagadh]], [[Bhavnagar]] and the [[Kutch District]]. They are essentially an urban community, except the Shaikh of [[Kutch]]. The [[Kutchi people|Kutchi]] Shaikh have three groups of equal status, the Shaikh Dada, Shaikh Sayed and Shaikh Fakeer. The first two are found in Kanyabee village and the last group in Shaikh Sumrasar village of the [[Bhuj]] [[taluka]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Shaikh by District History &amp; origin==

=== The Hansotis of Bharuch ===
The Shaikh of [[Bharuch]] include the Hansotis, a unique community, who initially arose from the [[Hansot]] taluka of [[Gujarat]]. The Hansoti dialect, which has often been assigned to a broader language known as "[[Bombay Urdu]]" has an archaic proto-[[Urdu]] character; it has retained Arabic and Turkic words which other Urdu dialects do not.

Modern Hansotis are a product of both indigenous populations, such as [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]s, [[Rajput]]s and [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]s, and diverse historic immigration, from countries including [[Yemen]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (Central Asia) and [[Habshi]]s! (North-east Africa).

Prominent people from Hansot include:
* [[Shaikh Samad]], who reported directly to the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] (regarding the [[Parsi]] community of [[Navsari]], among other matters);
* the actor [[Farooq Sheikh]], and;
* cricketer [[Abdulahad Malek]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/290721.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Shaikh of Gujarat are largely an urban community, with the exception being the Shaikh of [[Kutch]], who are largely farmers. In [[Kutch]], the Shaikh undertake rain fed agriculture, and grow mainly wheat, sorghum and groundnuts. A few rear goat, sheep and cattle. Those in the urban area engage in a number of occupation, and have traditions similar to other [[Gujarati Muslim]]s community. The majority of the Shaikh are [[Sunni]], the only exception being the Shaikh families of the town of [[Khambhat]], who are [[Shia]]. Like other [[Gujarati Muslim]]s, they too have a statewide caste association, the Shaikh Samyukh Mowath Jamat. The Shaikh of [[Gujarat]] have differing native languages depending on their particular ethnogenesis. Some speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] with large number of [[Urdu]] loanwords, while those of [[Kutch]] speak [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]]. .,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; &amp; yet others speak archaic proto-Urdu e.g. Hansotis.

==The Sodagar==

The Sodagar or Arab Shaikh are a small sub-group within the larger Shaikh community. They originate from the [[Hadhramaut]] region of [[Yemen]], and settled in the city of [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]], during the period of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule, and intermarried with the [[Sunni Bohra]] community. The community were involved the buying and selling of silk, and exporting it to the [[Middle East]]. They still maintain links with the [[Middle East]], being fluent in [[Arabic]]. But the Sodagar mohalla in Patan has declined, with many of their houses becoming crumbling ruins. They have their own caste association, the Jamat Shams Sofdagaran, which is involved in the up keep of their jamat khana, in the town of Patan. They are strictly endogamous, and do not marry with other Shaikh groups. There are still cases of intermarriage with [[Arab]] communities in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;Muslim Communities in Gujarat by Satish C Misra pages 112-114&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Habibullah, and three other former Taliban leaders described as moderates, [[Abdul Hakim Mujahid]], [[Arsullah Rahmani]] and [[Rahmatullah Wahidyar]] met with officials of the Hamid Karzai administration to discuss the possible surrender of active Taliban fighters.&lt;ref name=Rfe2009-01-08/&gt;

In an interview published on March 4, 2005 ''Radio Free Europe'', Habibullah said that the moderates had been in talks with the Karzai administration for the previous two years.

Habibullah, and the other three men had been named on the [[United Nations]] [[1267 list]], a list of several hundred individuals upon whom member nations were to impose financial sanctions because they were suspected of playing a role in international terrorism.&lt;ref name=UNAlQaidaList2003/&gt;

The Ika people are found in Delta and Edo states of southern Nigeria. The '''Ika people''' speak Ika language, a unique language with elements of Benin and Igbo languages. They share borders linguistically in the west with the Edo speakers, in the north with the Ishan speakers, in the East with the Enuani speakers and in the south with the Ukwale speakers.[1]

The Ika people are specifically located in the North-West of Delta State but some of their communities like Igbanke, Inyelen and Ekpon spilled over into Edo State. Ika communities mostly comprise the following: Agbor, Owa, Umunede, Owerre Olubor, Ekuoma, Emuhu, Mbiri, Abavo, Orogodo, Otolokpo, Igbodo, Ute-Okpu, Ute-Ogbeje, Idumuesah, Akumazi, Ekpon (Edo State), Igbanke (Edo State), Inyelen Edo State), Iru (Edo State). Other Ika communities found in Edo State are Owanikeke,Ute Obagie, Owa-Riuzo Idu and Igbogili.

Location
Geographically, the Ika speaking people are found in the north west of Delta State. They share borders linguistically in the west with the Edo speakers, in the north with the Ishan speakers, in the East with the Aniocha language speakers and in the south with the Ukwuani speakers. Politically, Ika speakers are mainly found in two local government areas, Ika North East and Ika South local government areas, both created in 1991 from a single Ika Local Government Area, in Delta State. Ika South and Ika North East local government areas, occupy a land area of 117.45 square kilometres (Delta State Government website, 1999) with a total population of about 240,000 people. There are other Ika speaking people that are political outside the Ika North east and Ika South local government areas. The exact population of speakers of the Ika language or those with Ika as mother tongue is not known since this information was not included in the 1991 census result (1991 census). Ika people do not have any shared physical characteristics distinguishing it from other ethnic or language groups in Delta State.

Language
Ika people speak the Ika language which has both elements of Benin and Igbo, this is what makes the language unique. To keep the language alive, there is now news in Ika language as a different language on Delta radio. Ikas have commenced writing the bible in Ika language and right now the gospel of Mathew, Mark, Luke and John have been published and there are books written in Ika language as well.

Origin
The Ika people do not trace their ancestry to common origin. The various clans that make up Ika have heterogeneous origins. Similarities of the language with Igbo suggests they might be Igbo connections but oral accounts and cultures as well as ancient ika name suggests bini origin. Ika historians have argued that changes in language can occur due to large migrations or trade or due to other factors.

Religion
The Ika people are predominantly Christians although traditional worship is still much in progress as ika people have been recorded to have kicked against the white men greatly. Ika people refer to God as Oselobue and Chukwu.

'''Imbolc''' or '''Imbolg''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ɡ}} {{respell|i|MOLG}}), also called ('''Saint''') '''Brigid's Day''' ({{lang-ga|Lá Fhéile Bríde}}, {{lang-gd|Là Fhèill Brìghde}}, {{lang-gv|Laa'l Breeshey}}), is a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] traditional festival marking the beginning of spring. Most commonly it is held on 1 and 2 February, or&lt;!--this doesn't imply that 1 Feb *is* the halfway point--&gt; about halfway between the [[winter solstice]] and the [[spring equinox]].&lt;ref name="Danaher1"&gt;Danaher, Kevin (1972) ''The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs'' Dublin, Mercier. {{ISBN|1-85635-093-2}} p.&amp;nbsp;38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill-1"&gt;McNeill, F. Marian (1959, 1961) ''The Silver Bough'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;1–4. William MacLellan, Glasgow; Vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–42&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, it was widely observed throughout [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals—along with [[Beltane]], [[Lughnasadh]] and [[Samhain]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Cunliffe|Cunliffe, Barry]] (1997). ''The Ancient Celts''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Page 188-190.&lt;/ref&gt;—and corresponds to the Welsh  ''{{lang|cy|[[Gŵyl Fair y Canhwyllau]]}}''. For Christians, especially in Ireland, it is the [[calendar of saints|feast day]] of [[Brigit of Kildare|Saint Brigid]].

Imbolc is mentioned in some of the [[Early Irish literature|earliest Irish literature]] and there is evidence it has been an important date since ancient times. It was originally a [[Celtic polytheism|pagan]] festival associated with the goddess [[Brigid]] (goddess of fertility) and that it was [[Christianization|Christianized]] as a festival of Saint Brigid, who is thought to be a [[Syncretism|Christianization]] of the goddess.&lt;ref name="berger"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Goddess Obscured: Transformation of the Grain Protectress from Goddess to Saint |last1=Berger |first1=Pamela |year= 1985 |pages=70–73 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=9780807067239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Imbolc, [[Brigid's cross]]es were made and a [[doll]]-like figure of Brigid, called a ''{{lang|ga|Brídeóg}}'', would be paraded from house-to-house. Brigid was said to visit one's home at Imbolc. To receive her blessings, people would make a bed for Brigid and leave her food and drink, while items of clothing would be left outside for her to bless. Brigid was also invoked to protect homes and livestock. Special feasts were had, [[holy well]]s were visited and it was also a time for [[divination]].

Although many of its customs died out in the 20th century, it is still observed and in some places it has been revived as a cultural event. Since the latter 20th century, [[Celtic neopaganism|Celtic neopagans]] and [[Wicca]]ns have observed Imbolc as a religious holiday.&lt;ref name="Danaher1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill-1"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The etymology of Imbolc/Imbolg is unclear. The most common explanation is that is comes from the [[Old Irish]] ''i mbolc'' (Modern Irish ''i mbolg''), meaning "in the belly", and refers to the pregnancy of ewes.&lt;ref name="Chadwick1"/&gt; Another possible origin is the Old Irish ''imb-fholc'', "to wash/cleanse oneself", referring to a ritual cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Brian. ''Brigid: Goddess, Druidess and Saint''. The History Press, 2011. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric P.

Studia Celtica 14/15 (1979–80), pp. 106–113&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Alan Ward derives it from the [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] ''*embibolgon'', "budding".&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Alan.

CreateSpace, 2011. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th century [[Sanas Cormaic|Cormac's Glossary]] derives it from ''oimelc'', "ewe milk",&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Kuno, ''Sanas Cormaic: an Old-Irish Glossary compiled by Cormac úa Cuilennáin, King-Bishop of Cashel in the ninth century'' (1912).&lt;/ref&gt; but many scholars see this as a [[folk etymology]]. Nevertheless, some Neopagans have adopted ''Oimelc'' as a name for the festival.

Since Imbolc is immediately followed (on 2 February) by  [[Candlemas]] (Irish ''Lá Fhéile [[Muire]] na gCoinneal'' "feast day of Mary of the Candles", [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''[[Gŵyl Fair y Canhwyllau]]''),&lt;ref name="Mackillop1"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = MacKillop | first1 = James | title = Dictionary of Celtic mythology | year = 1998 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 0-19-280120-1 | page = 270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish ''Imbolc'' is sometimes translated into English as "Candlemas"; e.g.  ''iar n-imbulc, ba garb a ngeilt'' translated as "after Candlemas, rough was their herding".&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn, Edward John, MRIA (1868–1941), The Metrical dindshenchas, Royal Irish Academy, Dublin, 1903–1935, iii 370.61.[http://www.dil.ie/results-list.asp?mode=BAS&amp;Fuzzy=0&amp;lang=en&amp;searchtext=%20Candlemas%20%28English%29&amp;sortField=ID&amp;sortDIR=65602&amp;respage=0&amp;resperpage=10&amp;bhcp=1]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The date of Imbolc is thought to have been significant in Ireland since the [[Neolithic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imbolc|url=http://www.newgrange.com/imbolc.htm|work=Newgrange UNESCO World Heritage website|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the alignment of some [[Megalith]]ic monuments. For example, at the [[Mound of the Hostages]] on the [[Hill of Tara]], the inner chamber is aligned with the rising sun on the dates of Imbolc and [[Samhain]].&lt;ref name=photo&gt;[http://www.knowth.com/hill-of-ward.htm Knowth.com photo of Samhain sunrise at the Mound of Hostages] "The Stone Age Mound of the Hostages is also aligned with the [[Samhain]] sun rise." The sun rises from the same angle on Imbolc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MOH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mythicalireland.com/ancientsites/tara/|title=Mythical Ireland – Ancient Sites – The Hill of Tara – Teamhair|first=Anthony|last=Murphy|website=Mythical Ireland – New light on the ancient past|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic Imbolc customs==
In [[Gaelic Ireland]], Imbolc was the ''feis'' or festival marking the beginning of spring, during which great feasts were held. It is attested in some of the earliest [[Old Irish literature]], from the 10th century onward. It was one of four Gaelic seasonal festivals: [[Samhain]] (~1 November), Imbolc (~1 February), [[Beltane]] (~1 May) and [[Lughnasadh]] (~1 August).

From the 18th century to the mid 20th century, many accounts of Imbolc or St Brigid's Day were recorded by [[folkloristics|folklorists]] and other writers. They tell us how it was celebrated then, and shed light on how it may have been celebrated in the past.&lt;ref name="McNeill-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Danaher2"&gt;Danaher, Kevin (1972) ''The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs'' Dublin, Mercier. {{ISBN|1-85635-093-2}} pp.&amp;nbsp;200–229&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Making crosses at St Brigids Well.JPG|thumb|250px|People making ''Brigid's crosses'' at St Brigid's Well near [[Liscannor]]]]
Imbolc has traditionally been celebrated on 1 February. However, because the [[day]] was deemed to begin and end at [[sunset]], the celebrations would start on what is now 31 January. It has also been argued that the timing of the festival was originally more fluid and based on seasonal changes. It has been associated with the onset of the lambing season&lt;ref name=koch287&gt;Koch, John T. ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia''. 2006. p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;—which could vary by as much as two weeks before or after 1 February&lt;ref name="Chadwick1"&gt;{{Cite book|last1 = Chadwick|first1 = Nora K.|title = The Celts|year = 1970|publisher = Penguin|location = Harmondsworth| isbn = 0-14-021211-6|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the blooming of [[blackthorn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1 = Aveni|first1 = Anthony F.|title = The Book of the Year: A Brief History of Our Seasonal Holidays|year = 2004|publisher = Oxford University Press, USA|isbn = 0-19-517154-3|page = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The holiday was a festival of the hearth and home, and a celebration of the lengthening days and the early signs of spring. Celebrations often involved hearthfires, special foods, divination or watching for omens, candles or a bonfire if the weather permitted.&lt;ref name="Danaher1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill"&gt;McNeill, F. Marian (1959) ''The Silver Bough'', Vol. 1,2,4. William MacLellan, Glasgow&lt;/ref&gt; Fire and purification were an important part of the festival. The lighting of candles and fires represented the return of warmth and the increasing power of the Sun over the coming months.&lt;ref name="Chadwick1"/&gt; A [[spring cleaning]] was also customary.&lt;ref name=danaher15&gt;Danaher, ''The Year in Ireland'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holy well]]s were visited at Imbolc, and at the other Gaelic festivals of Beltane and Lughnasa. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking '[[sunwise]]' around the well. They would then leave offerings; typically coins or [[clootie]]s (see [[clootie well]]). Water from the well was used to bless the home, family members, livestock and fields.&lt;ref name=danaher15/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Alexander Mackenzie]] also recorded that offerings were made "to earth and sea". The offering could be milk poured into the ground or porridge poured into the water, as a [[libation]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, Donald. ''Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend'' (1917). p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brigid===
[[File:Stbrigid.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Brigid in a stained-glass window]]
Imbolc is strongly associated with [[Brigit of Kildare|Saint Brigid]] ({{lang-sga|Brigit}}, modern Irish: ''{{lang|ga|Bríd}}'', modern Scottish Gaelic: ''{{lang|gd|Brìghde}}'' or ''{{lang|gd|Brìd}}'', anglicised ''Bridget''). Saint Brigid is thought to have been based on [[Brigid]], a Gaelic goddess.&lt;ref name="Mackillop2"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=MacKillop |first1=James |title=Dictionary of Celtic mythology |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-280120-1 |page=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival, which celebrates the onset of spring, is thought to be linked with Brigid in her role as a fertility goddess.&lt;ref name=koch287/&gt;

On Imbolc Eve, Brigid was said to visit virtuous households and bless the inhabitants.&lt;ref name="stations"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Hutton|title=Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1996 |pages=135–138|isbn=9780198205708}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Brigid represented the light half of the year, and the power that will bring people from the dark season of winter into spring, her presence was very important at this time of year.&lt;ref name="McNeill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmina5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/cg1/cg1074.htm|title=Carmina Gadelica Vol. 1: II. Aimsire: Seasons: 70 (notes). Genealogy of Bride. Sloinntireachd Bhride|website=Sacred-texts.com|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Families would have a special meal or supper on Imbolc Eve. This typically included food such as [[colcannon]], [[sowans]], [[dumpling]]s, [[barmbrack]] and/or [[bannock (food)|bannocks]].&lt;ref name="danaher15"/&gt; Often, some of the food and drink would be set aside for Brigid.&lt;ref name="stations"/&gt;

Brigid would be symbolically invited into the house and a bed would often be made for her. In the north of Ireland a family member, representing Brigid, would circle the home three times carrying rushes. They would then knock the door three times, asking to be let in. On the third attempt they are welcomed in, the meal is had, and the rushes are then made into a bed or crosses.&lt;ref&gt;Danaher, ''The Year in Ireland'', pp. 20–21, 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; In 18th century Mann, the custom was to stand at the door with a bundle of rushes and say "Brede, Brede, come to my house tonight. Open the door for Brede and let Brede come in". The rushes were then strewn on the floor as a carpet or bed for Brigid. In the 19th century, some old Manx women would make a bed for Brigid in the barn with food, ale, and a candle on a table.&lt;ref name="stations"/&gt; In the Hebrides in the late 18th century, a bed of hay would be made for Brigid and someone would then call out three times: "''{{lang|gd|a Bhríd, a Bhríd, thig a stigh as gabh do leabaidh}}''" ("{{lang|gd|Bríd Bríd}}, come in; thy bed is ready").&lt;ref name=stations/&gt; A white wand, usually made of birch, would be set by the bed. It represented the wand that Brigid was said to use to make the vegetation start growing again.&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, ''Carmina Gadelica'', p. 582&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, women in the Hebrides would dance while holding a large cloth and calling out "''{{lang|gd|Bridean, Bridean, thig an nall 's dean do leabaidh}}''" ("{{lang|gd|Bríd Bríd}}, come over and make your bed"). However, by this time the bed itself was rarely made.&lt;ref name=stations/&gt;

Before going to bed, people would leave items of clothing or strips of cloth outside for Brigid to bless.&lt;ref name="stations"/&gt; Ashes from the fire would be raked smooth and, in the morning, they would look for some kind of mark on the ashes as a sign that Brigid had visited.&lt;ref name="stations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="monaghan256"&gt;Monaghan, Patricia. ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore''. Infobase Publishing, 2004. p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The clothes or strips of cloth would be brought inside, and believed to now have powers of healing and protection.&lt;ref name="McNeill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmina5"/&gt;

[[File:Saint Brigid's cross.jpg|thumb|A ''Brigid's cross'']]

In Ireland and Scotland, a representation of Brigid would be paraded around the community by girls and young women. Sometimes the representative was a girl, but usually it was a doll-like figure known as a ''{{lang|ga|Brídeóg}}'' (also called a 'Breedhoge' or 'Biddy'). It would be made from [[Juncus|rushes]] or [[reed (plant)|reeds]] and clad in bits of cloth, shells and/or flowers.&lt;ref name="stations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="monaghan256"/&gt; In the Hebrides of Scotland, a bright shell or crystal called the ''{{lang|gd|reul-iuil Bríde}}'' (guiding star of Brigid) was set on its chest. The girls would carry it in procession while singing a hymn to Brigid. All wore white with their hair unbound as a symbol of purity and youth. They visited every house in the area, where they received either food or more decoration for the {{lang|gd|Brídeóg}}. Afterwards, they feasted in a house with the {{lang|gd|Brídeóg}} set in a place of honour, and put it to bed with lullabies. When the meal was done, the local young men humbly asked for admission, made obeisance to the {{lang|gd|Brídeóg}}, and joined the girls in dancing and merrymaking.&lt;ref name="stations"/&gt; In many parts, only unwed girls could carry the {{lang|gd|Brídeóg}}, but in some places both boys and girls carried it.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 17th century, Catholic families in the Hebrides would make a bed for the {{lang|gd|Brídeóg}} out of a basket.&lt;ref name="stations"/&gt; Up until the mid-20th century, children in Ireland still went house-to-house asking for pennies for "poor Biddy", or money for the poor. In [[County Kerry]], men in white robes went from house to house singing.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, [[Brigid's cross]]es (''pictured on the right'') were made at Imbolc. A Brigid's cross usually consists of rushes woven into a square or equilateral cross, although three-armed crosses have also been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ó Duinn,|first1=Seán|title=The Rites of Brigid: Goddess and Saint|date=2005|publisher=Columba Press|location=Dublin|isbn=978-1856074834|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Emyr Estyn Evans|Evans, Emyr Estyn]]. ''Irish Folk Ways'', 1957. p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; They were often hung over doors, windows and stables to welcome Brigid and protect the buildings from fire and lightning. The crosses were generally left there until the next Imbolc.&lt;ref name=stations/&gt; In western {{lang|ga|[[Connacht]]}}, people would make a ''{{lang|ga|Crios Bríde}}'' ({{lang|ga|Bríd}}'s girdle); a great ring of rushes with a cross woven in the middle. Young boys would carry it around the village, inviting people to step through it and so be blessed.&lt;ref name=stations/&gt;

Today, some people still make Brigid's crosses and {{lang|ga|Brídeóg}}s or visit holy wells dedicated to St Brigid on 1 February.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biddy's Day Festival, Killorglin ===

The Biddy is an ancient tradition associated with Mid Kerry, Ireland. A Biddy group consists of masked men and women dressed in white and wearing elaborate straw hats. Biddy groups visit rural and public houses. They carry a Brídeóg (effigy/doll of brigid as a child) with them to ensure evil spirits are kept away from humans and animals alike for the coming year. In each establishment, they will play music and put on displays of dancing and singing. The Biddy’s heritage is a mixture of Christianity (St Bridgid) and ancient Celtic traditions (Imbolc).

Traditionally, a visit from the Biddy guaranteed good luck, fertility, prosperity and to not receive a visit was considered a terrible sleight. A unique festival to celebrate the Biddy tradition is held annually in [[Killorglin]]. The highlight of this festival is the torchlight parade of the Biddies throughout the town followed by the King of the Biddy's contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biddysday.com/|title=Home|website=Biddy's Day|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weather divination===
[[File:Snowdrop.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Snowdrops in the snow]]
Imbolc was traditionally a time of weather [[divination]], and the old tradition of watching to see if serpents or badgers came from their winter dens may be a forerunner of the North American [[Groundhog Day]]. A Scottish Gaelic proverb about the day is:
{{Verse translation|{{lang|gd|Thig an nathair as an toll
Là donn Brìde,
Ged robh trì troighean dhen t-sneachd
Air leac an làir.}}
|The serpent will come from the hole
On the brown Day of Bríde,
Though there should be three feet of snow
On the flat surface of the ground.&lt;ref name="Carmina1"&gt;Carmichael, Alexander (1900) ''Carmina Gadelica: Hymns and Incantations, Ortha Nan Gaidheal, Volume I'', p.&amp;nbsp;169 [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/cg1/cg1074.htm The Sacred Texts Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Imbolc was believed to be when the {{lang|gd|[[Cailleach]]}}—the divine [[hag]] of Gaelic tradition—gathers her firewood for the rest of the winter. Legend has it that if she wishes to make the winter last a good while longer, she will make sure the weather on Imbolc is bright and sunny, so she can gather plenty of firewood. Therefore, people would be relieved if Imbolc is a day of foul weather, as it means the {{lang|gd|Cailleach}} is asleep and winter is almost over.&lt;ref name="Briggs2"&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1976) ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. New York, Pantheon Books., pp.&amp;nbsp;57–60&lt;/ref&gt; At Imbolc on the Isle of Man, where she is known as ''{{lang|gv|Caillagh ny Groamagh}}'', the {{lang|gd|Cailleach}} is said to take the form of a gigantic bird carrying sticks in her beak.&lt;ref name="Briggs2"/&gt;

==Imbolc in Neopaganism==
[[File:Imbolc Festival February 3rd 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|Imbolc celebration in [[Marsden, West Yorkshire]], February 2007]]
Imbolc or Imbolc-based festivals are held by some [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]]. As there are many kinds of Neopaganism, their Imbolc celebrations can be very different despite the shared name. Some try to emulate the historic festival as much as possible. Other Neopagans base their celebrations on many sources, with historic accounts of Imbolc being only one of them.&lt;ref name="Adler1"&gt;Adler, Margot (1979) ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''. Boston, Beacon Press {{ISBN|0-8070-3237-9}}. p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McColman, Carl (2003) ''Complete Idiot's Guide to Celtic Wisdom''. Alpha Press {{ISBN|0-02-864417-4}}. p.&amp;nbsp;51&lt;/ref&gt;

Neopagans usually celebrate Imbolc on 1 February in the Northern Hemisphere and 1 August in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nevill Drury|editor1-first=Murphy|editor1-last=Pizza|editor2-first=James R|editor2-last=Lewis|title=Handbook of Contemporary Paganism |year=2009|chapter=The Modern Magical Revival: Esbats and Sabbats|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwzttsI9-NwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=nevill%20drury&amp;f=false |pages=63–67 |location=[[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]]|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=9789004163737}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia |last=Hume |first=Lynne |year=1997 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |location=Melbourne |isbn=9780522847826}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vos|first=Donna|title=Dancing Under an African Moon: Paganism and Wicca in South Africa |year=2002|pages=79–86|publisher=Zebra Press|location=Cape Town|isbn=9781868726530}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bodsworth|first=Roxanne T|title=Sunwyse: Celebrating the Sacred Wheel of the Year in Australia |year=2003|publisher=Hihorse Publishing|location=Victoria, Australia|isbn=9780909223038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Neopagans celebrate it at the astronomical midpoint between the [[winter solstice]] and spring [[equinox]] (or the full moon nearest this point). In the Northern Hemisphere, this is usually on the 3rd or 4 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeoastronomy.com/seasons.html|title=archaeoastronomy.com explains the reason we have seasons|website=Archaeoastronomy.com|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Neopagans celebrate Imbolc when the primroses, dandelions, and other spring flowers emerge.&lt;ref name="Bonewits184-5"&gt;Bonewits, Isaac (2006) ''Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism''. New York, Kensington Publishing Group {{ISBN|0-8065-2710-2}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;184–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celtic Reconstructionist===
[[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic Reconstructionists]] strive to reconstruct the pre-Christian religions of the Celts. Their religious practices are based on research and historical accounts,&lt;ref name="McColman"&gt;McColman, Carl (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonewits130-7"&gt;Bonewits (2006) pp.&amp;nbsp;130–7&lt;/ref&gt; but may be modified slightly to suit modern life. They avoid [[syncretism]] (i.e. combining practises from different cultures). They usually celebrate the festival when the first stirrings of spring are felt, or on the full moon nearest this. Many use traditional songs and rites from sources such as ''The Silver Bough'' and ''The Carmina Gadelica''. It is a time of honouring the Goddess Brigid, and many of her dedicants choose this time of year for rituals to her.&lt;ref name="McColman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonewits130-7"/&gt;

===Wicca and NeoDruidry===

[[Wiccans]] and Neo-Druids celebrate Imbolc as one of the eight Sabbats in their [[Wheel of the Year]], following Midwinter and preceding [[Ostara]]. In Wicca, Imbolc is commonly associated with the goddess Brigid and as such it is sometimes seen as a "women's holiday" with specific rites only for female members of a [[coven]].&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Ann-Marie (2005). ''The Wicca Bible: The Definitive Guide to Magic and the Craft''. London: Godsfield Press. Page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[Dianic Wicca]]ns, Imbolc is the traditional time for [[initiation]]s.&lt;ref name="Budapest"&gt;Budapest, Zsuzsanna (1980) ''The Holy Book of Women's Mysteries'' {{ISBN|0-914728-67-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indian independence movement''' was a series of activities whose ultimate aim was to end the [[British Raj]] and encompassed activities and ideas aiming to end the [[East India Company]] rule (1757–1857) and the British Raj (1857–1947) in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The movement spanned a total of 90 years (1857–1947) considering movement against British Indian Empire. The Indian Independence movement includes both protest (peaceful and non-violent) and militant (violent) mechanisms to root out British Administration from India.

The first organised militant movements were in [[Bengal]], but they later took root in the newly formed [[Indian National Congress]] with prominent moderate leaders seeking only their basic right to appear for [[Indian Civil Service (British India)]] examinations, as well as more rights, economic in nature, for the people of the soil. The early part of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards political self-rule proposed by leaders such as the [[Lal Bal Pal|Lal, Bal, Pal]] and [[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindo Ghosh]], [[V. O. Chidambaram Pillai]]. The last stages of the self-rule struggle from the 1920s onwards saw Congress adopt [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]'s policy of nonviolence and [[civil disobedience]], and several other campaigns. Nationalists like [[Subhash Chandra Bose]], [[Bhagat Singh]], [[Bagha Jatin]] preached armed revolution to achieve self-rule. Poets and writers such as [[Subramania Bharati]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Muhammad Iqbal]], [[Josh Malihabadi]], [[Mohammad Ali Jouhar]], [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] used literature, poetry and speech as a tool for political awareness. Feminists such as [[Sarojini Naidu]] and [[Begum Rokeya]] promoted the emancipation of Indian women and their participation in national politics.  [[B. R. Ambedkar]] championed the cause of the disadvantaged sections of Indian society within the larger self-rule movement. The period of the [[Second World War]] saw the peak of the campaigns by the [[Quit India Movement]] led by Congress, and the [[Indian National Army]] movement led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]].

The Indian self-rule movement was a mass-based movement that encompassed various sections of society. It also underwent a process of constant ideological evolution.&lt;ref name="Chandra26"&gt;{{harvnb|Chandra|1989|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the basic ideology of the movement was anti-colonial, it was supported by a vision of independent capitalist economic development coupled with a secular, democratic, republican, and [[civil liberty|civil-libertarian]] political structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chandra|1989|p=521}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1930s, the movement took on a strong socialist orientation, owing to the influence of Bhagat Singh's demand of Purna Swaraj (Complete Self-Rule).&lt;ref name="Chandra26"/&gt; The work of these various movements led ultimately to the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]], which ended the suzerainty in India and the creation of [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. India remained a Dominion of [[the Crown]] until 26 January 1950, when the ''[[Constitution of India]]'' came into force, establishing the [[Republic of India]]; Pakistan was a dominion until 1956, when it adopted its [[Constitution of Pakistan|first republican constitution]]. In 1971, [[East Pakistan]] declared independence as the [[Bangladesh|People's Republic of Bangladesh]].

[[File:Tipu death.jpg|thumb|After the defeat of [[Tipu Sultan]], most of South India was now either under the company's direct rule, or under its indirect political control]]

European traders first reached Indian shores with the arrival of the Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1498 at the port of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]], in search of the lucrative [[spice trade]]. Just over a century later, the Dutch and English established trading outposts on the subcontinent, with the first English trading post set up at [[Surat]] in 1613.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heehs|1998|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the British&lt;ref&gt;The [[English colonial empire]], including the territories and trading post in Asia, came under [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] control following the [[Acts of Union 1707|union of England and Scotland in 1707]].&lt;/ref&gt; defeated the Portuguese and Dutch militarily, but remained in conflict with the French, who had by then sought to establish themselves in the subcontinent. The decline of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the first half of the eighteenth century provided the British with the opportunity to establish a firm foothold in Indian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heehs|1998|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, during which the East India Company's [[Indian Army]] under [[Robert Clive]] defeated [[Siraj ud-Daulah]], the [[Nawab of Bengal]], the Company established itself as a major player in Indian affairs, and soon afterwards gained administrative rights over the regions of [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and Midnapur part of [[Odisha|Orissa]], following the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heehs|1998|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat of [[Tipu Sultan]], most of South India came either under the Company's direct rule, or under its indirect political control as part a [[princely state]] in a [[subsidiary alliance]]. The Company subsequently gained control of regions ruled by the [[Maratha Empire]], after defeating them in a series of wars. [[Punjab Province (British India)|The Punjab]] was annexed in 1849, after the defeat of the Sikh armies in the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|First]] (1845–1846) and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second]] (1848–49) Anglo-Sikh Wars.

English was made the medium of instruction in India's schools in 1835, and many Indians increasingly disliked British rule. The English tried to impose the Western standards of education and culture on Indian masses, believing in the 18th century superiority of Western culture and enlightenment.

===Early rebellion===
[[Puli Thevar]] was one of the opponents of the [[British Raj|British]] rule in [[India]]. He was in conflict with the [[Nawab of Arcot]] who was supported by the British. His prominent exploits were his confrontations with [[Muhammed Yusuf Khan|Marudhanayagam]], who later rebelled against the British in the late 1750s and early 1760s. Nelkatumseval the present Tirunelveli Dist of Tamil Nadu state of India was the headquarters of Puli Thevan

[[Syed Mir Nisar Ali Titumir]]; 27 January 1782 – 19 November 1831) was an Islamic preacher who led a peasant uprising against the Hindu zamindars, British India during the 19th century. Along with his followers, he built a bamboo fort (Bansher Kella in Bengali) in Narkelberia Village, which passed into Bengali folk legend. After the storming of the fort by British soldiers, Titumir died of his wounds on 19 November 1831.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Muazzam Hussain. "Titu Mir". Banglapedia. Bangladesh Asiatic Society. Retrieved 4 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The toughest resistance the Company experienced was offered by [[Anglo-Mysore Wars|Mysore]]. The Anglo–Mysore Wars were a series of wars fought in over the last three decades of the 18th century between the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] on the one hand, and the British East India Company (represented chiefly by the [[Madras Presidency]]), and [[Maratha Confederacy]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] on the other. [[Hyder Ali]] and his successor [[Tipu Sultan]] fought a war on four fronts with the British attacking from the west, south and east, while the Marathas and the Nizam's forces attacked from the north. The fourth war resulted in the overthrow of the house of Hyder Ali and Tipu (who was killed in the final war, in 1799), and the dismantlement of Mysore to the benefit of the East India Company, which won and took control of much of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/East-India-Company|title=East India Company - Definition, History, &amp; Facts|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pazhassi Raja|Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja]] was one of the earliest freedom fighters in India. He was the prince regent of the princely state of Kottiyur or Cotiote in North Malabar, near Kannur, India between 1774 and 1805. He fought a guerrilla war with tribal people from Wynad supporting him. He was caught by the British and his fort was razed to the ground.

Rani [[Velu Nachiyar]] (1730–1796), was a queen of Indian Sivaganga from 1760 to 1790. She was the first queen to fight against the British in India. Rani Nachiyar was trained in war match weapons usage, martial arts like Valari, Silambam (fighting using stick), horse riding and archery. She was a scholar in many languages and she had proficiency with languages like French, English and Urdu. When her husband, Muthuvaduganathaperiya Udaiyathevar, was killed by British soldiers and the son of the Nawab of Arcot, she was drawn into battle. She formed an army and sought an alliance with Gopala Nayaker and Hyder Ali with the aim of attacking the British, whom she did successfully fight in 1780. When Rani Velu Nachiyar found the place where the British stored their ammunition, she arranged a suicide attack: a faithful follower, [[Kuyili]], doused herself in oil, set herself alight and walked into the storehouse. Rani Velu Nachiyar formed a woman's army named "udaiyaal" in honour of her adopted daughter, Udaiyaal, who died detonating a British arsenal. Rani Nachiyar was one of the few rulers who regained her kingdom, and ruled it for ten more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remembering-queen-velu-nachiyar-sivagangai-first-queen-fight-british-55163 |title=Remembering Queen Velu Nachiyar of Sivagangai, the first queen to fight the British|website=The News Minute|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Velu-Nachiyar-Jhansi-Rani-of-Tamil-Nadu/articleshow/51436071.cms|title=Velu Nachiyar, Jhansi Rani of Tamil Nadu|date=17 March 2016 |newspaper=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Veerapandiya Kattabomman]] was an eighteenth-century [[Polygar]] and chieftain from [[Panchalankurichi]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], India who waged a [[Polygar War|war]] against the East India Company.

In September 1804, the King of [[Khordha]], [[Odisha|Kalinga]]  was deprived of the traditional rights of [[Jagannath]] Temple which was a serious shock to the King and the people of [[Odisha]].

===The rebellion of 1857===
{{Main|Indian Rebellion of 1857}}
[[File:Indian revolt of 1857 states map.svg|right|thumb|States during the rebellion]]
The Indian rebellion of 1857 was a large-scale rebellion in the northern and central India against the British East India Company's rule. It was suppressed and the British government took control of the company. The conditions of service in the company's army and [[cantonment]]s increasingly came into conflict with the religious beliefs and prejudices of the [[sepoy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chandra|1989|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominance of members from the upper castes in the army, perceived loss of caste due to overseas travel, and rumours of secret designs of the government to convert them to Christianity led to deep discontent among the sepoys.&lt;ref name="Chandra 1989 34"&gt;{{harvnb|Chandra|1989|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sepoys were also disillusioned by their low salaries and the racial discrimination practised by British officers in matters of promotion and privileges.&lt;ref name="Chandra 1989 34"/&gt; The indifference of the British towards leading native Indian rulers such as the [[Mughals]] and ex-[[Peshwa]]s and the annexation of [[Oudh]] were political factors triggering dissent amongst Indians. The [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquess of Dalhousie]]'s policy of annexation, the [[doctrine of lapse]] (or escheat) applied by the British, and the projected removal of the descendants of the Great Mughal from their ancestral palace at [[Red Fort]] to the Qutb Minaar (near Delhi) also angered some people.

The final spark was provided by the rumoured use of tallow (from cows) and lard (pig fat) in the newly introduced [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]] rifle cartridges. Soldiers had to [[bite the cartridge]]s with their teeth before loading them into their rifles, and the reported presence of cow and pig fat was religiously offensive to both Hindu and Muslim soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bd0018)|title=The Uprising of 1857|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mangal Pandey]], a 29-year-old sepoy, was believed to be responsible for inspiring the Indian sepoys to rise against the British.  Pandey revolted against his army regiment for protection of the cow, considered sacred by Hindus. In the first week of May 1857, he killed a higher officer in his regiment at [[Barrackpore]] for the introduction of the rule. He was captured and was sentenced to death when the British took back control of the regiment.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} On 10 May 1857, the sepoys at [[Meerut]] broke rank and turned on their commanding officers, killing some of them.  They reached Delhi on 11 May, set the company's [[toll house]] on fire, and marched into the Red Fort, where they asked the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]], [[Bahadur Shah II]], to become their leader and reclaim his throne.  The emperor was reluctant at first, but eventually agreed and was proclaimed ''Shehenshah-e-Hindustan'' by the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chandra|1989|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rebels also murdered much of the European, [[Anglo-Indian|Eurasian]], and Christian population of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|David|2002|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolts broke out in other parts of [[Oudh]] and the [[North-Western Provinces]] as well, where [[civil rebellion]] followed the mutinies, leading to popular uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandra|1989|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British were initially caught off-guard and were thus slow to react, but eventually responded with force.  The lack of effective organisation among the rebels, coupled with the military superiority of the British, brought a rapid end to the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandra|1989|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British fought the main army of the rebels near Delhi, and after prolonged fighting and a siege, defeated them and retook the city on 20 September 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandra|1989|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, revolts in other centres were also crushed.  The last significant battle was fought in [[Gwalior]] on 17 June 1858, during which [[Rani Lakshmibai]] was killed.  Sporadic fighting and [[guerrilla warfare]], led by [[Tatya Tope]], continued until spring 1859, but most of the rebels were eventually subdued.

The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major turning point in the history of modern India. While affirming the military and political power of the British,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heehs|1998|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; it led to significant change in how India was to be controlled by them. Under the [[Government of India Act 1858]], the Company was deprived of its involvement in ruling India, with its territory being transferred to the direct authority of the British government.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1923 |accessdate = 30 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the apex of the new system was a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet minister]], the [[Secretary of State for India]], who was to be formally advised by a [[Council of India|statutory council]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heehs|1998|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Governor-General of India]] (Viceroy) was made responsible to him, while he in turn was responsible to the government. In a [[royal proclamation]] made to the people of India, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] promised equal opportunity of public service under British law, and also pledged to respect the rights of the native princes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heehs|1998|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British stopped the policy of seizing land from the princes, decreed religious tolerance and began to admit Indians into the civil service (albeit mainly as subordinates). However, they also increased the number of British soldiers in relation to native Indian ones, and only allowed British soldiers to handle artillery.  [[Bahadur Shah II|Bahadur Shah]] was exiled to [[Yangon|Rangoon]], Burma, where he died in 1862.

In 1876, in a controversial move Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] acceded to the Queen's request{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} and passed legislation to give Queen Victoria the additional title of [[Empress of India]].  Liberals in Britain objected that the title was foreign to British traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robert P.

===Rise of organised movements===

{{Main|Nationalist Movements in India}}
{{See also|Indian National Congress}}
[[File:1st INC1885.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Image of the delegates to the first meeting of the Indian National Congress in Bombay, 1885.]]
The decades following the Rebellion were a period of growing political awareness, manifestation of Indian public opinion and emergence of Indian leadership at both national and provincial levels. [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] formed the East India Association in 1867 and [[Surendranath Banerjee]] founded the [[Indian National Association]] in 1876. Inspired by a suggestion made by [[Allan Octavian Hume|A.O. Hume]], a retired British civil servant, seventy-two Indian delegates met in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in 1885 and founded the [[Indian National Congress]]. They were mostly members of the upwardly mobile and successful western-educated provincial elites, engaged in professions such as law, [[teaching]] and journalism. At its inception, the Congress had no well-defined ideology and commanded few of the resources essential to a political organisation.  Instead, it functioned more as a debating society that met annually to express its loyalty to the British Raj and passed numerous resolutions on less controversial issues such as civil rights or opportunities in government (especially in the civil service).  These resolutions were submitted to the Viceroy's government and occasionally to the British Parliament, but the Congress's early gains were slight.  "Despite its claim to represent all India, the Congress voiced the interests of urban elites;{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} the number of participants from other social and economic backgrounds remained negligible."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|title= General Studies History 4 Upsc Preliminary Examination|last=Reddy|first=Krishna, K|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing|year=2006|location=New Delhi UK|pages=C34|isbn=978-0-07-060447-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this period of history is still crucial because it represented the first political mobilisation of Indians, coming from all parts of the subcontinent and the first articulation of the idea of India as one nation, rather than a collection of independent princely states.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The influence of socio-religious groups such as ''[[Arya Samaj]]'' (started by [[Dayananda Saraswati|Swami Dayanand Saraswati]]) and ''[[Brahmo Samaj]]'' (founded by [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]] and others) became evident in pioneering reforms of Indian society. The work of men like [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Ramakrishna]], [[Sri Aurobindo]], [[V. O. Chidambaram Pillai]], [[Subramanya Bharathy]], [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]], Sir [[Syed Ahmed Khan]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], as well as women such as the Scots–Irish [[Sister Nivedita]], spread the passion for rejuvenation and freedom. The rediscovery of India's indigenous history by several European and Indian scholars also fed into the rise of nationalism among Indians.

{{Main|Nationalist Movements in India}}
[[File:Lal Bal Pal.jpg|thumb|[[Lala Lajpat Rai]] of [[Punjab]], [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] of [[Maharashtra]], and [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] of [[Bengal]], the triumvirate were popularly known as [[Lal Bal Pal]], changed the political discourse of the Indian independence movement.]]
By 1900, although the Congress had emerged as an all-India political organisation, it did not have the support of most Indian Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Sisson|author2=Stanley A. Wolpert|title=Congress and Indian Nationalism: The Pre-independence Phase|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfOSxFVQa8IC&amp;pg=PA198|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06041-8|pages=198–|quote=For the most part, however, Muslim India remained either aloof from or distrustful of the Congress and its demands.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks by Hindu reformers against religious conversion, cow slaughter, and the preservation of [[Urdu language|Urdu]] in [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] script deepened their concerns of minority status and denial of rights if the Congress alone were to represent the people of India. Sir [[Syed Ahmed Khan]] launched a movement for Muslim regeneration that culminated in the founding in 1875 of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at [[Aligarh]], Uttar Pradesh (renamed [[Aligarh Muslim University]] in 1920).  Its objective was to educate wealthy students by emphasising the compatibility of Islam with modern western knowledge.  The diversity among India's Muslims, however, made it impossible to bring about uniform cultural and intellectual regeneration.

The nationalistic sentiments among Congress members led to the movement to be represented in the bodies of government, to have a say in the legislation and administration of India. Congressmen saw themselves as loyalists, but wanted an active role in governing their own country, albeit as part of the Empire. This trend was personified by [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], who went as far as contesting, successfully, an election to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], becoming its first Indian member.

[[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] was the first Indian nationalist to embrace ''[[Swaraj]]'' as the destiny of the nation{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. Tilak deeply opposed the then British education system that ignored and defamed India's culture, history and values. He resented the denial of freedom of expression for nationalists, and the lack of any voice or role for ordinary Indians in the affairs of their nation. For these reasons, he considered Swaraj as the natural and only solution. His popular sentence "Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it" became the source of inspiration for Indians.

In 1907, the Congress was split into two factions: The ''radicals'', led by Tilak, advocated civil agitation and direct revolution to overthrow the British Empire and the abandonment of all things British. The ''moderates'', led by leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], on the other hand wanted reform within the framework of British rule. Tilak was backed by rising public leaders like [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] and [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], who held the same point of view. Under them, India's three great states – [[Maharashtra]], Bengal and [[Punjab region|Punjab]] shaped the demand of the people and India's nationalism. Gokhale criticised Tilak for encouraging acts of violence and disorder. But the Congress of 1906 did not have public membership, and thus Tilak and his supporters were forced to leave the party.

But with Tilak's arrest, all hopes for an Indian offensive were stalled. The Congress lost credibility with the people. A Muslim deputation met with the Viceroy, [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|Minto]] (1905–10), seeking concessions from the impending constitutional reforms, including special considerations in government service and electorates.  The British recognised some of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]'s petitions by increasing the number of elective offices reserved for Muslims in the [[Indian Councils Act 1909]].  The Muslim League insisted on its separateness from the Hindu-dominated Congress, as the voice of a "nation within a nation".

The [[Ghadar Party]] was formed overseas in 1913 to fight for the Independence of India with members coming from the United States and Canada, as well as  Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ramnath |first1=Maia |title=Haj to Utopia: How the Ghadar Movement Charted Global Radicalism and Attempted to Overthrow the British Empire |date=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |isbn=9780520269552 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the party aimed for Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim unity against the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Latif |first1=Asad |title=India in the Making of Singapore |date=2008 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |location=Singapore |isbn=9789810815394 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[temperance movement in India]] became aligned with Indian nationalism under the direction of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], who saw alcohol as a foreign importation to the culture of the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="BlockerFahey2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blocker|first1=Jack S.|last2=Fahey|first2=David M.|last3=Tyrrell|first3=Ian R.|title=Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History: An International Encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|language=English|isbn=9781576078334|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischer-Tiné|Tschurenev|2014|pp=255–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partition of Bengal, 1905==
{{Main|Partition of Bengal (1905)|Direct Action Day|Noakhali riots}}
[[File:Khudiram Bose 1905 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Khudiram Bose]] was one of the youngest Indian revolutionaries tried and executed by the British.]]
In July 1905, [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], the Viceroy and Governor-General (1899–1905), ordered the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of the province of Bengal]] supposedly for improvements in administrative efficiency in the huge and populous region.&lt;ref&gt;John R. McLane, "The Decision to Partition Bengal in 1905" ''Indian Economic and Social History Review,'' July 1965, 2#3, pp 221–237&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Indians viewed the partition as an attempt by the British to disrupt the growing national movement in Bengal and divide the Hindus and Muslims of the region. The Bengali Hindu intelligentsia exerted considerable influence on local and national politics. The partition outraged Bengalis. Not only had the government failed to consult Indian public opinion, but the action appeared to reflect the British resolve to [[divide and rule]]. Widespread agitation ensued in the streets and in the press, and the Congress advocated boycotting British products under the banner of ''[[swadeshi]]'', or indigenous industries. A growing movement emerged, focussing on indigenous Indian industries, finance, and education, which saw the founding of [[National Council of Education]], the birth of Indian financial institutions and banks, as well as an interest in Indian culture and achievements in science and literature. Hindus showed unity by tying [[Raksha Bandhan|Rakhi]] on each other's wrists and observing ''Arandhan'' (not cooking any food). During this time, Bengali Hindu nationalists like [[Sri Aurobindo]], [[Bhupendranath Datta]], and [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] began writing virulent newspaper articles challenging legitimacy of British rule in India in publications such as ''[[Jugantar (paper)|Jugantar]]'' and ''Sandhya'', and were charged with sedition. Brahmabhandav Upadhyay, a Hindu newspaper editor who helped Tagore establish his school at Shantiniketan, was imprisoned and the first to die in British custody in the twentieth-century struggle for self-rule. The movement also witnessed violent [[revolutionary movement for Indian independence]], notable revolutionary being [[Khudiram Bose]], who planted bombs near British government officials and police stations. Due to his activities against the British, he was arrested and hanged. At the time of his hanging, he was 18 years, 8 months 8 days old, making him one of the youngest revolutionaries in India.&lt;ref name=Guha&gt;{{Harvnb|Guha|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation not found|date=September 2018}}

The British newspaper, ''The Empire'', wrote:&lt;ref name=Patel2008&gt;{{Harvnb|Patel|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Khudiram Bose was executed this morning;...It is alleged that he mounted the scaffold with his body erect. He was cheerful and smiling.}}

==All India Muslim League==
The [[All-India Muslim League]] was founded by the [[All India Muhammadan Educational Conference]] at [[Dhaka]] (now [[Bangladesh]]), in 1906, in the context of the circumstances that were generated over the partition of Bengal in 1905.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Being a political party to secure the interests of the Muslim diaspora in [[British Raj|British India]], the Muslim League played a decisive role behind the creation of [[Pakistan]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jalal|1994|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] joined the [[Indian National Congress]], which was the largest Indian political organisation. Like most of the Congress at the time, Jinnah did not favour outright self-rule, considering British influences on education, law, culture and industry as beneficial to India. Jinnah became a member of the sixty-member [[Imperial Legislative Council]]. The council had no real power or authority, and included a large number of un-elected pro-Raj loyalists and Europeans. Nevertheless, Jinnah was instrumental in the passing of the ''Child Marriages Restraint Act'', the legitimisation of the Muslim [[waqf]] (religious endowments) and was appointed to the Sandhurst committee, which helped establish the [[Indian Military Academy]] at [[Dehradun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/Quaid/politician7.htm|title=The Statesman: Jinnah's differences with the Congress|first=Government of Pakistan|last=Official website|accessdate=20 April 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060127234847/http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/Quaid/politician7.htm |archivedate = 27 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First World War]], Jinnah joined other Indian moderates in supporting the British war effort.

==First World War==

[[File:Indian army soldier after siege of Kut.jpg|thumb|This photograph shows an emaciated Indian Army soldier who survived the [[Siege of Kut]], part of the campaign in Mesopotamia ]]
The First World War began with an unprecedented outpouring of support towards Britain from within the mainstream political leadership, contrary to initial British fears of an Indian revolt. India contributed massively to the British war effort by providing men and resources. About 1.3 million Indian soldiers and laborers served in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food, money and ammunition. However, Bengal and [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] remained hotbeds of [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|anti colonial activities]]. Nationalism in Bengal, increasingly closely linked with the [[Ghadar Mutiny|unrests in Punjab]], was significant enough to nearly paralyze the regional administration, whilst [[Hindu-German Conspiracy|failed conspiracies]] were made by revolutionaries to trigger nationalist revolt in India.&lt;ref name=Gupta12&gt;{{Harvnb|Gupta|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Popplewell 1995 p=201"&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the revolutionary conspiracies had significant impact inside India. The prospect of subversive violence and its effect on the popular war effort drew support amongst Indian population for special measures against anti-colonial activities in the form of [[Defence of India Act 1915]], and no major mutinies occurred. However, the war-time conspiracies did lead to profound fears of insurrection among British officials, preparing them to use extreme force to frighten the Indians into submission.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence James, ''Raj: The Making and Unmaking of British India'' (2000) pp 439–518&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalist response to war===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
In the aftermath of the First World War, high casualty rates, soaring inflation compounded by heavy taxation, a [[1918 influenza pandemic|widespread influenza epidemic]] and the disruption of trade during the war escalated human suffering in India.

The pre-war nationalist movement revived as moderate and extremist groups within the Congress submerged their differences in order to stand as a unified front.They argued their enormous services to the British Empire during the war demanded a reward, and demonstrated the Indian capacity for self-rule. In 1916, the Congress succeeded in forging the [[Lucknow Pact]], a temporary alliance with the Muslim League over the issues of devolution of political power and the future of Islam in the region.

===British reforms===
The British themselves adopted a "carrot and stick" approach in recognition of India's support during the war and in response to renewed nationalist demands. In August 1917, [[Edwin Samuel Montagu|Edwin Montagu]], the secretary of state for India, made the historic announcement in Parliament that the British policy for India was "increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realization of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire." The means of achieving the proposed measure were later enshrined in the [[Government of India Act, 1919]], which introduced the principle of a dual mode of administration, or diarchy, in which both elected Indian legislators and appointed British officials shared power. The act also expanded the central and provincial legislatures and widened the franchise considerably. Diarchy set in motion certain real changes at the provincial level: a number of non-controversial or "transferred" portfolios, such as agriculture, local government, health, education, and public works, were handed over to Indians, while more sensitive matters such as finance, taxation, and maintaining law and order were retained by the provincial British administrators.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Raj: The Making and Unmaking of British India'' (2000) pp 459–60, 519–20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gandhi arrives in India==
{{See also|Rowlatt Satyagraha|Jallianwala Bagh massacre}}
[[File:Gandhi Kheda 1918.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Gandhi in 1918, at the time of the Kheda and Champaran satyagrahas]]
[[File:Dr Rajendra Pd. DR.Anugrah Narayan Sinha.jpg|thumb|200px|left|upright=0.85|(Sitting L to R) [[Rajendra Prasad]] and [[Anugrah Narayan Sinha]] during [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s 1917 [[Champaran Satyagraha]].]]
Gandhi had been a leader of the Indian nationalist movement in [[South Africa]].He had also been a vocal opponent of basic discrimination and abusive labour treatment as well as suppressive police control such as the [[Rowlatt Acts]].  During these protests, Gandhi had perfected the concept of ''[[satyagraha]]''.In January 1914 (well before the First World War began) Gandhi was successful. The legislation against Indians was repealed and all Indian political prisoners were released by General [[Jan Smuts]].&lt;ref&gt;Denis Judd, ''Empire: The British Imperial Experience From 1765 To The Present'' (pp 226-411998)&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi accomplished this through extensive use of non-violent protests, such as boycotting, protest marching, and fasting by him and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Indian Independence Movement|url=http://www.tcnj.edu/|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi returned to India on 9 January 1915, and initially entered the political fray not with calls for a nation-state, but in support of the unified commerce-oriented territory that the Congress Party had been asking for. Gandhi believed that the industrial development and educational development that the Europeans had brought with them were required to alleviate many of India's problems. [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], a veteran Congressman and Indian leader, became Gandhi's mentor. Gandhi's ideas and strategies of non-violent [[civil disobedience]] initially appeared impractical to some Indians and Congressmen. In Gandhi's own words, "civil disobedience is civil breach of immoral statutory enactments."  It had to be carried out non-violently by withdrawing co-operation with the corrupt state.  Gandhi had great respect for Lokmanya Tilak. His programmes were all inspired by Tilak's "Chatusutri" programme. It was at this point he met the prophet Ryan Chart, where he founded some of his most spiritual messages with his British colleague. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The positive impact of reform was seriously undermined in 1919 by the [[Rowlatt Act]], named after the recommendations made the previous year to the [[Imperial Legislative Council]] by the [[Rowlatt Committee]]. The commission was set up to look into the war-time conspiracies by the nationalist organisations and recommend measures to deal with the problem in the post-war period.  Rowlatt recommended the extension of the war-time powers of the [[Defence of India act 1915|Defence of India act]] into the post-war period. The war-time act had vested the Viceroy's government with extraordinary powers to quell sedition by silencing the press, detaining [[Activism|political activists]] without trial, and arresting any individuals suspected of sedition or treason without a warrant. It was increasingly reviled within India due to widespread and indiscriminate use. Many popular leaders, including [[Annie Beasant]] and Ali brothers had been detained. Rowlatt act was, therefore, passed in the face of universal opposition among the (non-official) Indian members in the Viceroy's council. The extension of the act drew widespread opposition and criticism. In protest, a nationwide cessation of work (''[[hartal]]'') was called, marking the beginning of widespread, although not nationwide, popular discontent.

The agitation unleashed by the acts led to British attacks on demonstrators, culminating on 13 April 1919, in the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] (also known as the Amritsar Massacre) in [[Amritsar]], Punjab.  The British military commander, Brigadier-General [[Reginald Dyer]], blocked the main, and only entrance, and ordered his soldiers to fire into an unarmed and unsuspecting crowd of some 15,000 men, women and children. They had assembled peacefully at Jallianwala Bagh, a walled courtyard, but Dyer had wanted to execute the imposed ban on all meetings and proposed to teach all Indians a lesson the harsher way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collett|2005|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 1,651 rounds were fired, killing 379 people (as according to an official British commission; Indian officials' estimates ranged as high as 1,499 and wounding 1,137 in the massacre.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lloyd|2011|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyer was forced to retire but was hailed as a hero in Britain, demonstrating to Indian nationalists that the Empire was beholden to public opinion in Britain, but not in India.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Sayer, "British Reaction to the Amritsar Massacre 1919–1920," ''Past &amp; Present,'' May 1991, Issue 131, pp 130–164&lt;/ref&gt; The episode dissolved wartime hopes of home rule and goodwill and opened a rift that could not be bridged short of complete self-rule.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Judd, "The Amritsar Massacre of 1919: Gandhi, the Raj and the Growth of Indian Nationalism, 1915–39," in Judd, ''Empire: The British Imperial Experience from 1765 to the Present'' (1996) pp 258- 72&lt;/ref&gt;

===First non-co-operation movement===
From 1920 to 1922, Gandhi started the Non-Cooperation Movement.  At the Kolkata session of the Congress in September 1920, Gandhi convinced other leaders of the need to start a non-co-operation movement in support of Khilafat as well as for dominion status. The first satyagraha movement urged the use of [[khadi]] and Indian material as alternatives to those shipped from Britain. It also urged people to boycott British educational institutions and law courts; resign from government employment; refuse to pay taxes; and forsake British titles and honours. Although this came too late to influence the framing of the new ''[[Government of India Act 1919]]'', the movement enjoyed widespread popular support, and the resulting unparalleled magnitude of disorder presented a serious challenge to foreign rule. However, Gandhi called off the movement because he was scared after [[Chauri Chaura incident]], which saw the death of twenty-two policemen at the hands of an angry mob.

Membership in the party was opened to anyone prepared to pay a token fee, and a hierarchy of committees was established and made responsible for discipline and control over a hitherto amorphous and diffuse movement. The party was transformed from an elite organisation to one of mass national appeal and participation.

Gandhi was sentenced in 1922 to six years in prison, but was released after serving two. On his release from prison, he set up the [[Sabarmati Ashram]] in [[Ahmedabad]], on the banks of river [[Sabarmati River|Sabarmati]], established the newspaper ''Young India'', and inaugurated a series of reforms aimed at the socially disadvantaged within Hindu society&amp;nbsp;— the rural poor, and the [[Dalit (outcaste)|untouchables]].&lt;ref&gt;Sankar Ghose, ''Gandhi'' (1991) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Paswan and Pramanshi Jaideva, ''Encyclopaedia of Dalits in India'' (2003) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

This era saw the emergence of new generation of Indians from within the Congress Party, including [[C. Rajagopalachari]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Vallabhbhai Patel]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and others- who would later on come to form the prominent voices of the Indian self-rule movement, whether keeping with Gandhian Values, or, as in the case of Bose's [[Indian National Army]], diverging from it.

The Indian political spectrum was further broadened in the mid-1920s by the emergence of both moderate and militant parties, such as the [[Swaraj Party]], [[Hindu Mahasabha]], [[Communist Party of India]] and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]]. Regional political organisations also continued to represent the interests of non-[[Brahmin]]s in [[Madras]], [[Mahar]]s in [[Maharashtra]], and [[Sikh]]s in Punjab. However, people like Mahakavi [[Subramanya Bharathi]], [[Vanchinathan]] and Neelakanda Brahmachari played a major role from Tamil Nadu in both self-rule struggle and fighting for equality for all castes and communities.

Many women participated in the movement, including Kasturba Gandhi (Gandhi's wife), Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, Muthulaxmi Reddy, Aruna Asaf Ali, and many others.

== Purna Swaraj ==
Following the rejection of the recommendations of the [[Simon Commission]] by Indians, an all-party conference was held at [[Mumbai]] in May 1928. This was meant to instill a sense of Liberation among people. The conference appointed a drafting committee under [[Motilal Nehru]] to draw up a constitution for India. The [[Kolkata]] session of the Indian National Congress asked the British government to accord dominion status to India by December 1929, or a countrywide civil disobedience movement would be launched. By 1929, however, in the midst of rising political discontent and increasingly violent regional movements, the call for complete sovereignty and end of British rule began to find increasing grounds within the Public. Under the presidency of [[Jawaharlal]] at his historic [[Lahore]] session in December 1929, [[the Indian National Congress]] adopted the idea of complete self-rule and end of British rule. It authorised the Working Committee to launch a civil disobedience movement throughout the country. It was decided that 26 January 1930 should be observed all over India as the ''[[Purna Swaraj]]'' (complete self-rule) Day. Many Indian political parties and Indian revolutionaries of a wide spectrum united to observe the day with honour and pride.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In March 1931, the [[Gandhi-Irwin Pact]] was signed, and the government agreed to set all political prisoners free (Although, some of the great revolutionaries were not set free and the death sentence for Bhagat Singh and his two comrades was not taken back which further intensified the agitation against Congress not only outside it but within the Congress itself).
For the next few years, the Congress and the government were locked in conflict and negotiations until what became the [[Government of India Act 1935]] could be hammered out. By then, the rift between the Congress and the Muslim League had become unbridgeable as each pointed the finger at the other acrimoniously. The Muslim League disputed the claim of the Congress to represent all people of India, while the Congress disputed the Muslim League's claim to voice the aspirations of all Muslims.

The Civil Disobedience Movement indicated a new part in the process of the Indian self-rule struggle. As a whole, it became a failure by itself, but it brought the Indian population together, under the Indian National Congress's leadership. The movement made the Indian people strive even more towards self-rule. The movement allowed the Indian community to revive their inner confidence and strength against the British Government. In addition, the movement weakened the authority of the British and aided in the end of the British Empire in India. Overall, the civil disobedience Movement was an essential achievement in the history of Indian self-rule.

==Elections and the Lahore resolution==
{{Main|Indian provincial elections, 1937}}
[[File:Jinnah Gandhi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Jinnah]] with [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]], 1944.]]
The [[Government of India Act 1935]], the voluminous and final constitutional effort at governing [[British India]], articulated three major goals: establishing a loose federal structure, achieving provincial autonomy, and safeguarding minority interests through separate electorates. The federal provisions, intended to unite [[princely state]]s and British India at the centre, were not implemented because of ambiguities in safeguarding the existing privileges of princes. In February 1937, however, provincial autonomy became a reality when elections were held; the Congress emerged as the dominant party with a clear majority in five provinces and held an upper hand in two, while the Muslim League performed poorly.

In 1939, the Viceroy [[Victor Alexander John Hope|Linlithgow]] declared India's entrance into the Second World War without consulting provincial governments. In protest, the Congress asked all of its elected representatives to resign from the government. [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the president of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]], persuaded participants at the annual Muslim League session at Lahore in 1940 to adopt what later came to be known as the [[Lahore Resolution]], demanding the division of India into two separate sovereign states, one Muslim, the other Hindu; sometimes referred to as [[Two Nation Theory]]. Although the idea of [[Pakistan]] had been introduced as early as 1930, very few had responded to it. However, the volatile political climate and hostilities between the Hindus and Muslims transformed the idea of Pakistan into a stronger demand.

Apart from a few stray incidents, armed rebellions against the British rulers did not occur before the beginning of the 20th century. The Indian revolutionary underground began gathering momentum through the first decade of the 20th century, with groups arising in Bengal, [[Maharashtra]], [[Odisha]], Bihar, [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], and the [[Madras Presidency]] including what is now called [[South India]]. More groups were scattered around India. Particularly notable movements arose in Bengal, especially around the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]] in 1905, and in [[1907 Punjab unrest|Punjab after 1907]].&lt;ref name=Fraser257&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|1977|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the former case, it was the educated, intelligent and
dedicated youth of the urban middle class ''[[Bhadralok]]'' community that came to form the "classic" Indian revolutionary,&lt;ref name=Fraser257/&gt; while the latter had an immense support base in the rural and Military society of the Punjab. In Bengal, the ''[[Anushilan Samiti]]'' emerged [[History of the Anushilan Samiti|from conglomerations]] of local youth groups and gyms (''Akhra'') in Bengal in 1902, forming two prominent and somewhat independent arms in [[East Bengal|East]] and [[West Bengal]] identified as ''[[Dhaka Anushilan Samiti]]''  in [[Dhaka]] (modern day [[Bangladesh]]), and the ''[[Jugantar]]'' group (centred at [[Calcutta]]) respectively. Led by nationalists of the likes of [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] and his brother [[Barindra Ghosh]], the ''Samiti'' was influenced by philosophies as diverse as [[Hindu]] [[Shakti|''Shakta'' philosophy]] propounded by Bengali literaetuer [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay|Bankim]] and [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda]], [[Carbonari|Italian Nationalism]], and [[Pan-Asianism]] of [[Kakuzo Okakura]]. The ''Samiti'' was involved in a number of noted incidences of revolutionary terrorism against British interests and administration in India within the decade of its founding, including [[Alipore bomb case|early attempts]] to assassinate Raj officials whilst led by Ghosh brothers. In the meantime, in Maharashtra and Punjab arose similarly militant nationalist feelings. The District Magistrate of [[Nasik]], [[A.M.T. Jackson]] was shot dead by [[Anant Kanhere]] in December 1909, followed by the death of Robert D'Escourt Ashe at the hands of [[Vanchi Iyer]].&lt;ref name=Yadav4&gt;{{Harvnb|Yadav|1992|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian nationalism made headway through Indian societies as far as Paris and London. In London [[India House]] under the patronage of [[Shyamji Krishna Verma]] came under increasing scrutiny for championing and justifying violence in the cause of Indian nationalism, which found in Indian students in Britain and from Indian expatriates in [[Paris Indian Society]] avid followers. By 1907, through Indian nationalist [[Madame Bhikaji Rustom Cama]]'s links to Russian revolutionary Nicholas Safranski, Indian groups including Bengal revolutionaries as well as India House under [[V.D.Savarkar]] were able to obtain manuals for manufacturing bombs. India House was also a source of arms and seditious literature that was rapidly distributed in India. In addition to ''The Indian Sociologist'', pamphlets like ''Bande Mataram'' and ''Oh Martyrs!'' by Savarkar extolled revolutionary violence. Direct influences and incitement from India House were noted in several incidents of political violence, including assassinations, in India at the time.&lt;ref name=Yadav4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hopkirk46&gt;{{Harvnb|Hopkirk|1994|p=46}} [By 1909] India House was beginning to come under suspicion ... too late to save Sir William Curzon Wyllie from the assassin's pistol ...

He despatched these copies to various addresses in India.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the two charges against Savarkar during his trial in Bombay was for abetting the murder of the District Magistrate of Nasik, A.M.T. Jackson, by [[Anant Kanhere]] in December 1909. The arms used were directly traced through an Italian courier to India House. Ex-India House residents M.P.T. Acharya and V.V.S.

Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were followed by the [[Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy|1912 attempt]] on the life of Viceroy of India. Following this, the nucleus of networks formed in [[India House]], the [[Anushilan Samiti]], nationlalists in Punjab, and the nationalism that arose among Indian expatriates and labourers in North America, a different movement began to emerge in the North American [[Ghadar Party]], culminating in the  [[Hindu-German Conspiracy|Sedetious conspiracy]] of World War I led by [[Rash Behari Bose]] and [[Lala Hardayal]].

However, the emergence of the Gandhian movement slowly began to absorb the different revolutionary groups. The Bengal ''Samiti'' moved away from its philosophy of violence in the 1920s, when a number of its members identified closely with the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] and Gandhian non-violent movement. Revolutionary nationalist violence saw a resurgence after the collapse of Gandhian Noncooperation movement in 1922. In Bengal, this saw reorganisation of groups linked to the ''Samiti'' under the leadership of [[Surya Sen]] and [[Hem Chandra Kanungo]]. A spate of violence led up to enactment of the [[Bengal Criminal Law Amendment]] in the early 1920s, which recalled the powers of incarceration and detention of the Defence of India Act. In north India, remnants of Punjab and Bengalee revolutionary organisations reorganised, notably under [[Sachindranath Sanyal]], founding the [[Hindustan Republican Association]] with [[Chandrashekhar Azad]] in north India. The HSRA had strong influences from leftist ideologies. [[Hindustan Socialist Republican Association]] (HSRA) was formed under the leadership of [[Chandrasekhar Azad]]. [[Kakori train robbery]] was done largely by the members of HSRA. A number of Congress leaders from Bengal, especially [[Subhash Chandra Bose]], were accused by the British Government of having links with and allowing patronage to the revolutionary organisations during this time. The violence and radical philosophy revived in the 1930s, when revolutionaries of the ''Samiti'' and the HSRA were involved in was involved in the [[Chittagong armoury raid]] and the [[Kakori conspiracy]] and other attempts against the administration in British India and Raj officials.  [[Bhagat Singh]] and [[Batukeshwar Dutt]] threw a bomb inside the [[Central Legislative Assembly]] on 8 April 1929 protesting against the passage of the Public Safety Bill and the Trade Disputes Bill while raising slogans of "[[Inquilab Zindabad]]", though no one was killed or injured in the bomb incident. Bhagat Singh surrendered after the bombing incident and a trial was conducted. Sukhdev and Rajguru were also arrested by police during search operations after the bombing incident. Following the trial (Central Assembly Bomb Case), Bhagat Singh, [[Sukhdev]] and [[Rajguru]] were hanged in 1931. [[Allama Mashriqi]] founded [[Khaksars|Khaksar Tehreek]] in order to direct particularly the Muslims towards the self-rule movement.&lt;ref&gt;Khaksar Tehrik Ki Jiddo Juhad Volume 1. Author Khaksar Sher Zaman&lt;/ref&gt; Some of its members left for the Indian National Congress then led by Subhas Chandra Bose, while others identified more closely with [[Communism]]. The ''Jugantar'' branch formally dissolved in 1938. On 13 March 1940, [[Udham Singh]] shot [[Michael O'Dwyer]](the last political murder outside India), generally held responsible for the [[Amritsar Massacre]], in London. However, the revolutionary movement gradually disseminated into the Gandhian movement. As the political scenario changed in the late 1930s&amp;nbsp;— with the mainstream leaders considering several options offered by the British and with religious politics coming into play&amp;nbsp;— revolutionary activities gradually declined. Many past revolutionaries joined mainstream politics by joining [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] and other parties, especially communist ones, while many of the activists were kept under hold in different jails across the country.

Within a short time of its inception, these organisations became the focus of an extensive police and intelligence operations. Operations against ''[[Anushilan Samiti]]'' saw founding of the [[Special Branch|Special branch]] of [[Calcutta Police]]. The intelligence operations against India House saw the founding of the [[Indian Political Intelligence Office]] which later grew to be the Intelligence bureau in independent India. Heading the intelligence and missions against Ghadarite movement and India revolutionaries was the [[MI5(g)]] section, and at one point invokved the [[Pinkerton's]] detective agency. Notable officers who led the police and intelligence operations against Indian revolutionaries, or were involved in it, at various time included [[John Arnold Wallinger]], [[Sir Robert Nathan]], [[Sir Harold Stuart]], [[Vernon Kell]], [[Sir Charles Stevenson-Moore]] and [[Sir Charles Tegart]], as well as [[W. Somerset Maugham]]. The threat posed by the activities of the ''Samiti'' in Bengal during [[World War I]], along with the threat of a [[Ghadar mutiny|Ghadarite uprising in Punjab]], saw the passage of [[Defence of India Act 1915]]. These measures saw the arrest, internment, transportations and execution of a number of revolutionaries linked to the organisation, and was successful in crushing the East Bengal Branch. In the aftermath of the war, the [[Rowlatt committee]] recommended extending the Defence of India Act (as the [[Rowlatt act]]) to thwart any possible revival of the ''Samiti'' in Bengal and the Ghadarite movement in Punjab. In the 1920s, [[Alluri Sitarama Raju]] led the ill-fated [[Rampa Rebellion of 1922]]–24, during which a band of tribal leaders and other sympathisers fought against the British Raj. He was referred to as "Manyam Veerudu" ("Hero of the Jungles") by the local people. After the passing of the 1882 Madras Forest Act, its restrictions on the free movement of tribal peoples in the forest prevented them from engaging in their traditional ''[[Podu (agriculture)|podu]]'' ([[Slash-and-burn]]) agricultural system, which involved [[shifting cultivation]]. Raju led a protest movement in the border areas of the Godavari Agency in [[Madras Presidency]] (present-day [[Andhra Pradesh]]). Inspired by the patriotic zeal of revolutionaries in Bengal, Raju raided police stations in and around [[Chintapalle, Visakhapatnam|Chintapalle]], [[Rampachodavaram]], [[Dammanapalli]], Krishna-devi-peta, [[Rajavommangi]], [[Addateegala]], [[Narsipatnam]] and [[Annavaram]]. Raju and his followers stole guns and ammunition and killed several British army officers, including Scott Coward near Dammanapalli.&lt;ref name="Balakrishna"&gt;{{cite web|last=Balakrishna|first=V.G.|title=Freedom Movement in Andhra Pradesh|url=http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr98/fe0798/PIBF0707982.html|publisher=Government of India Press Information Bureau|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British campaign lasted for nearly a year from December 1922. Raju was eventually trapped by the British in the forests of Chintapalli then tied to a tree and shot dead with a rifle.&lt;ref name="Balakrishna"/&gt;

Government of India through the Ministry of Home Affairs has later notified 38 movements/struggles across Indian territories as the ones that led to the country gaining self-rule and ending the [[British Raj]]. The [[Kallara-Pangode Struggle]] is one of these 39 agitations.

==Final process of Indian self-rule movement==
In 1937, [[Indian Provincial Elections, 1937|provincial elections]] were held and the Congress came to power in seven of the eleven provinces. This was a strong indicator of the Indian people's support for complete self-rule.

When the Second World War started, [[Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow|Viceroy Linlithgow]] unilaterally declared India a belligerent on the side of Britain, without consulting the elected Indian representatives. In opposition to Linlithgow's action, the entire Congress leadership resigned from the provincial and local governments. The Muslims and Sikhs, by contrast, strongly supported the war effort and gained enormous stature in London. Defying Congress, millions of Indians supported the war effort, and indeed the [[Indian Army during World War II|British Indian Army]] became the largest volunteer force, numbering 2,500,000 men during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roy | first1 = Kaushik | year = 2009 | title = Military Loyalty in the Colonial Context: A Case Study of the Indian Army during World War II | url = | journal = Journal of Military History | volume = 73 | issue = 2| pages = 144–172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially during the [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940, Gandhi resisted calls for massive civil disobedience movements that came from within as well as outside his party, stating he did not seek India's self-rule out of the ashes of a destroyed Britain. In 1942, the Congress launched the [[Quit India]] movement. There was some violence but the Raj cracked down and arrested tens of thousands of Congress leaders, including all the main national and provincial figures. They were not released until the end of the war was in sight in 1945.

The self-rule movement saw the rise of three movements: The first of these, the [[Kakori conspiracy]] (9 August 1925) was led by Indian youth under the leadership of [[Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil]]; second was the [[Azad Hind]] movement led by [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose]] which saw its inception early in the war and joined Germany and Japan to fight Britain; the third one saw its inception in August 1942, was led by [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]]&lt;ref&gt;Dr.'Krant'M.L. Verma ''Swadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas'' (Vol-2) p.559&lt;/ref&gt; and reflected the common man resulting the failure of the [[Cripps' mission]] to reach a consensus with the Indian political leadership over the transfer of power after the war.

The entry of India into the war was strongly opposed by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], who had been elected President of the Congress in 1938 and 1939, but later resigned due to differences in opinion with Gandhi. After resignation he formed his own wing separated from the mainstream congress leadership known as [[Forward bloc]] which was the centre of ex-congressmen with socialist views; however he remained emotionally attached with him for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bose|1985|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bose then founded the [[All India Forward Bloc]]. In 1940, a year after war broke out, the British had put Bose under house arrest in Calcutta. However, he escaped and made his way through [[Afghanistan]] to [[Nazi Germany]] to seek [[Axis powers of World War II|Hitler and Mussolini's]] help for raising an army to fight the British.  The [[Free India Legion]] comprising [[Erwin Rommel]]'s Indian POWs was formed.  However,  in light of Germany's changing fortunes, a German land invasion of India became untenable and Hitler advised Bose to go to Japan and arranged for a submarine. Bose was ferried to Japanese Southeast Asia, where he formed the [[Azad Hind Government]], a Provisional Free Indian Government in exile, and reorganised the [[Indian National Army]] composed of Indian [[POW]]s and volunteering Indian [[expatriates]] in South-East Asia, with the help of the Japanese. Its aim was to reach India as a fighting force that would build on public resentment to inspire revolts among Indian soldiers to defeat the British ''raj''.

The INA was to see action against the allies, including the [[British Indian Army]], in the forests of Arakan, [[Burma]] and in [[Assam]], laying [[Battle of Imphal|siege on Imphal and Kohima]] with the [[Japanese 15th Army]]. During the war, the [[Andaman and Nicobar]] islands [[Invasion and Occupation of the Andaman Islands during World War II|were captured by the Japanese]] and handed over by them to the INA.

The INA failed owing to disrupted logistics, poor supplies from the Japanese, and lack of training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondediplo.com/2005/05/13wwiiasia |title=Forgotten armies of the East – Le Monde diplomatique – English edition |publisher=Mondediplo.com |date=10 May 2005 |accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It surrendered unconditionally to the British in Singapore in 1945.  Bose, however, attempted to escape to Japanese-held Manchuria in an attempt to escape to the Soviet Union, marking the end of the entire Azad Hind movement.

===Quit India Movement===
{{Main|Quit India Movement}}
The Quit India Movement ''(Bharat Chhodo Andolan)'' or the ''August Movement'' was a [[civil disobedience]] movement in [[India]] which commenced on 8 August 1942 in response to [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s call for immediate self-rule by Indians and against sending Indians to World War II. He asked all teachers to leave their schools, and other Indians to leave their respective jobs and take part in this movement. Due to Gandhi's political influence, his request was followed by a massive proportion of the population. In addition, the INC led the Quit India Movement to demand the British to leave India and to transfer the political power to INC.

During the movement, Gandhi and his followers continued to use non-violence against British rule. This movement was where Gandhi gave his famous message, "Do or Die!", and this message spread towards the Indian community. In addition, this movement was addressed directly to women as "disciplined soldiers of Indian freedom" and they had to keep the war for independence to go on (against British rule).

[[File:QUITIN2.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Procession in [[Bangalore]] during the [[Quit India Movement]].]]
At the outbreak of war, the Congress Party had during the Wardha meeting of the working-committee in September 1939, passed a resolution conditionally supporting the fight against fascism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicc.org.in/the_congress_and_the_freedom_movement.htm#the|title=The Congress and The Freedom Movement|accessdate=24 September 2007|publisher =Indian National Congress |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811001411/http://www.aicc.org.in/the_congress_and_the_freedom_movement.htm#the |archivedate = 11 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were rebuffed when they asked for self-rule in return. In March 1942, faced with an increasingly dissatisfied sub-continent only reluctantly participating in the war, and deteriorations in the war situation in Europe and [[South East Asia]], and with growing dissatisfactions among Indian troops- especially in Europe- and among the civilian population in the sub-continent, the British government sent a delegation to India under [[Stafford Cripps]], in what came to be known as the [[Cripps' Mission]]. The purpose of the mission was to negotiate with the [[Indian National Congress]] a deal to obtain total co-operation during the war, in return of progressive devolution and distribution of power from the crown and the [[Viceroy]] to elected Indian legislature. However, the talks failed, having failed to address the key demand of a timeframe towards self-government, and of definition of the powers to be relinquished, essentially portraying an offer of limited dominion-status that was wholly unacceptable to the Indian movement.&lt;ref name= Barkawi &gt;Culture and Combat in the Colonies. The Indian Army in the Second World War. Tarak Barkawi. J Contemp History. 41(2), 325–355.pp:332&lt;/ref&gt; To force the British Raj to meet its demands and to obtain definitive word on total self-rule, the Congress took the decision to launch the Quit India Movement.

The aim of the movement was to force the British Government to the negotiating table by holding the Allied war effort hostage. The call for determined but [[passive resistance]] that signified the certitude that Gandhi foresaw for the movement is best described by his call to ''Do or Die'', issued on 8 August at the [[Gowalia Tank]] Maidan in Bombay, since renamed ''August Kranti Maidan'' (August Revolution Ground). However, almost the entire Congress leadership, and not merely at the national level, was put into confinement less than 24 hours after Gandhi's speech, and the greater number of the Congress khiland were to spend the rest of the war in jail.

On 8 August 1942, the Quit India resolution was passed at the Mumbai session of the All India Congress Committee (AICC). The draft proposed that if the British did not accede to the demands, a massive Civil Disobedience would be launched. However, it was an extremely controversial decision. At Gowalia Tank, [[Mumbai]], Gandhi urged Indians to follow a non-violent civil disobedience. Gandhi told the masses to act as citizens of a sovereign nation and not to follow the orders of the British. The British, already alarmed by the advance of the Japanese army to the India–Burma border, responded the next day by imprisoning Gandhi at the [[Aga Khan Palace]] in [[Pune]]. The Congress Party's Working Committee, or national leadership was arrested all together and imprisoned at the Ahmednagar Fort. They also banned the party altogether. All the major leaders of the INC were arrested and detained. As the masses were leaderless the protest took a violent turn. Large-scale protests and demonstrations were held all over the country. Workers remained absent en masse and strikes were called. The movement also saw widespread acts of sabotage, Indian under-ground organisation carried out bomb attacks on allied supply convoys, government buildings were set on fire, electricity lines were disconnected and transport and communication lines were severed. The disruptions were under control in a few weeks and had little impact on the war effort. The movement soon became a leaderless act of defiance, with a number of acts that deviated from Gandhi's principle of non-violence. In large parts of the country, the local underground organisations took over the movement. However, by 1943, ''Quit India'' had petered out.

All the other major parties rejected the Quit India plan, and most cooperated closely with the British, as did the princely states, the civil service and the police. The [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] supported the Raj and grew rapidly in membership, and in influence with the British.

There was opposition to the Quit India Movement from several political quarters who were fighting for Indian self-rule. Hindu nationalist parties like the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] openly opposed the call and boycotted the Quit India Movement.&lt;ref name="Bapu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Prabhu Bapu|title=Hindu Mahasabha in Colonial North India, 1915–1930: Constructing Nation and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUFalxUFFWkC&amp;pg=PA103|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-67165-1|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]], the president of the Hindu Mahasabha at that time, even went to the extent of writing a letter titled "Stick to your Posts", in which he instructed Hindu Sabhaites who happened to be "members of municipalities, local bodies, legislatures or those serving in the army...to stick to their posts" across the country, and not to join the Quit India Movement at any cost.&lt;ref name="Bapu2013"/&gt;

The other Hindu nationalist organisation, and Mahasabha affiliate [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) had a tradition of keeping aloof from the anti-British Indian self-rule movement since its founding by [[K.B. Hedgewar]] in 1925. In 1942, the RSS, under [[M.S. Golwalkar]] completely abstained from joining in the Quit India Movement as well. The Bombay government (British) appreciated the RSS as such, by noting that,
&lt;blockquote&gt; The Sangh has scrupulously kept itself within the law, and in particular, has refrained from taking part in the disturbances that broke out in August 1942.&lt;ref name="Bandyopādhyāẏa2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sekhara Bandyopadhyaya |year=2004 |title=From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0oVra0ulQ3QC&amp;pg=PA422 |publisher=Orient Blackswan |page=422 |isbn=978-81-250-2596-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The British Government stated that the RSS was not at all supporting any civil disobedience against them, and as such their other political activities(even if objectionable) can be overlooked.&lt;ref name="Chandra2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Chandra|2008|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further, the British Government also asserted that at Sangh meetings organised during the times of anti-British movements started and fought by the [[Indian National Congress]],
&lt;blockquote&gt; Speakers urged the Sangh members to keep aloof from the congress movement and these instructions were generally observed.&lt;ref name="Chandra2008"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; As such, the British government did not crack down on the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha at all.

The RSS head (sarsanghchalak) during that time, [[M.S. Golwalkar]] later openly admitted to the fact that the RSS did not participate in the Quit India Movement. However, such an attitude during the Indian independence movement also led to the Sangh being viewed with distrust and anger, both by the general Indian public, as well as certain members of the organisation itself. In Golwalkar's own words,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1942 also, there was a strong sentiment in the hearts of many. At that time too, the routine work of the Sangh continued. Sangh decided not to do anything directly. ‘Sangh is the organisation of inactive people, their talks have no substance’ was the opinion uttered not only by outsiders but also our own swayamsevaks.&lt;ref name="Puniyani2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Puniyani|2005|pp=134-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Islam2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shamsul Islam|title=Religious Dimensions of Indian Nationalism: A Study of RSS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaQjbO8SN48C&amp;pg=PA187|year=2006|publisher=Media House|isbn=978-81-7495-236-3|pages=187–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Overall, the Quit India Movement turned out to be not very successful and only lasted until 1943. It drew away from Gandhi's tactic of non-violence; it eventually became a rebellious act without any real leader.

===Christmas Island Mutiny and Royal Indian Navy Revolt===
{{Main|Battle of Christmas Island|Royal Indian Navy Mutiny}}

After two Japanese attacks on [[Christmas Island]] in late February and early March 1942, relations between the British officers and their Indian troops broke down. On the night of 10 March, the Indian troops assisted by Sikh policemen mutinied, killing five British soldiers and imprisoning the remaining 21 Europeans on the island. Later on 31 March, a Japanese fleet arrived at the island and the Indians surrendered.&lt;ref name="CITA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.christmas.net.au/about/history.html | title=Christmas Island History | publisher=Christmas Island Tourism Association | accessdate=9 December 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208180546/http://www.christmas.net.au/about/history.html | archivedate=8 December 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Indian Navy Mutiny]] encompasses a [[strike action|total strike]] and subsequent [[mutiny]] by Indian sailors of the Royal Indian revolt on board ship and shore establishments at Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) harbour on 18 February 1946. From the initial flashpoint in Bombay, the mutiny spread and found support throughout [[British India]], from [[Karachi]] to [[Calcutta]] and ultimately came to involve 78 ships, 20 shore establishments and 20,000 sailors.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Notes_on_India.html?id=-ipOZf7y_B4C&amp;redir_esc=y Notes on India]'' By Robert Bohm.pp213&lt;/ref&gt;

The agitations, mass strikes, demonstrations and consequently support for the mutineers, therefore continued several days even after the mutiny had been called off. Along with this, the assessment may be made that it described in crystal clear terms to the government that the [[British Indian Armed forces]] could no longer be universally relied upon for support in crisis, and even more it was more likely itself to be the source of the sparks that would ignite trouble in a country fast slipping out of the scenario of political settlement.&lt;ref&gt;James L.

==Sovereignty and partition of India==
{{Main|History of the Republic of India|Partition of India|Pakistan movement}}

On 3 June 1947, Viscount [[Louis Mountbatten]], the last British [[Governor-General of India]], announced the partitioning of British India into India and [[Pakistan]]. With the speedy passage through the British Parliament of the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]], at 11:57 on [[Yom-e-Istiqlal|14 August 1947]] Pakistan was declared a separate nation, and at 12:02, just after
midnight, on [[Independence Day (India)|15 August 1947]], India also became a sovereign and democratic nation. Eventually, 15 August became the Independence Day for India, due to the ending of British rule over India. On that 15 August, both Pakistan and India had the right to remain in or remove themselves from the British Commonwealth. In 1949, India decided to remain in the commonwealth.

Violent clashes between Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims followed. Prime Minister Nehru and deputy prime minister Sardar [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] invited Mountbatten to continue as [[Governor General of India]]. He was replaced in June 1948 by [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]]. Patel took on the responsibility of bringing into the Indian Union 565 princely states, steering efforts by his "iron fist in a velvet glove" policies, exemplified by the use of military force to integrate [[Junagadh]] and [[Hyderabad State]] into India ([[Operation Polo]]). On the other hand, Nehru kept the issue of [[Kashmir]] in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mitra|1997|pp=55–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constituent Assembly, headed by the prominent lawyer, reformer and Dalit leader, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was tasked with creating the constitution of free India. The Constituent Assembly completed the work of drafting the constitution on 26 November 1949; on 26 January 1950, the [[Republic of India]] was officially proclaimed. The Constituent Assembly elected Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]] as the first [[President of India]], taking over from Governor General Rajgopalachari. Subsequently, the French ceded [[Chandernagore]] in 1951, and [[Pondicherry district|Pondichéry]] and its remaining Indian colonies in 1954. India [[Indian annexation of Goa|invaded and annexed Goa]] and Portugal's other [[Portuguese India|Indian enclaves]] in 1961, and [[Sikkim]] voted to join the Indian Union in 1975.

Following self-rule in 1947, India remained in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and [[India–United Kingdom relations|relations between the UK and India]] have been friendly. There are many areas in which the two countries seek stronger ties for mutual benefit, and there are also strong cultural and social ties between the two nations. The UK has an ethnic Indian population of over 1.6 million. In 2010, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] described Indian – British relations as a "New [[Special Relationship]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ministers to build a new 'special relationship' with India |first= Dean |last= Nelson |newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=7 July 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/7877719/Ministers-to-build-a-new-special-relationship-with-India.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though resource rich, [[Bolivia]] is one of the poorest countries in [[Latin America]]. In the 1980s the tin market collapsed, the currency dived, and inflation soared. [[Austerity]] measures restored some confidence, but at the cost of widening inequality. This was exacerbated when, at the behest of the US, coca growing, a prime source of income for the poor, was shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia country profile|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1210487.stm|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also tensions over natural gas deposits, perhaps Bolivia's last remaining resource. And while [[GDP]] and [[Gross national income|GNI]] have both grown significantly since 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Bank Data/Bolivia|url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/bolivia|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; severe disparities exist both regionally and ethnically. [[UNICEF]] reports that women and children are the most vulnerable group. In 2002, the percentage of the population living below the poverty line was 82% in rural areas and 54% in urban areas.The departments with the most poverty are Potosi, Chuquisaca and Pando, while Santa Cruz and Tarija have the least.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNICEF/Situation of poverty in the country|url=https://www.unicef.org/bolivia/resources_2332.htm|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gini coefficient]] data indicates that income inequality in [[Bolivia]] has increased from 1990 to 2014 (from 42 to 48.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GINI index (World Bank estimate)|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?locations=BO|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Inequality==
Bolivia is one of the most culturally diverse societies in Latin America, with approximately 35 different ethnic groups. Official figures from the Bolivian 
Population Census 2001 estimates that approximately 62% of the total population are indigenous in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Bolivian Census 2001, Los pueblos indígenas de Bolivia: diagnóstico sociodemográfico a partir del censo del 2001, [http://www.eclac.org/cgi-bin/getProd.asp?xml=/publicaciones/xml/3/23263/P23263.xml&amp;xsl=/celade/tpl/p9f.xsl&amp;base=/celade/tpl/top-bottom.xsl]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this majority of the population remain highly marginalized in economic terms and continue to live in extreme poverty. In Bolivia, mean income per capita in indigenous households was about 300 Bolivian Bolivianos per month in 2001 compared with 480 Bolivian Bolivianos for non-indigenous households.&lt;ref&gt;Bolivian Census 2001, Los pueblos indígenas de Bolivia: diagnóstico sociodemográfico a partir del censo del 2001, [http://www.eclac.org/cgi-bin/getProd.asp?xml=/publicaciones/xml/3/23263/P23263.xml&amp;xsl=/celade/tpl/p9f.xsl&amp;base=/celade/tpl/top-bottom.xsl]&lt;/ref&gt; This gap can partly be explained by the fact that the largest source of income among the non-indigenous is non-agricultural wages, while the most important source of income for indigenous families, is agricultural self-employment which tend to be lower on average. By factoring out the difference in income due to types of employment, indigenous families still receive lower average incomes compared to non-indigenous families even within each category of employment. It should also be noted that the differences in income might also be due to differences in worker characteristics. However, neither labour market experience nor female participation seems to drive the differences in incomes. Education has appeared to have the biggest correlation with the disparity in income.

==Ethnic Education Gap==
The main [[social indicator]]s by the (such as illiteracy rate, mother and child mortality; primary and secondary enrolment rates) also indicate that indigenous peoples have significantly less access to social services than non-indigenous peoples. While non-indigenous people (age 15 and older) completed on average 9.6 years of education, indigenous peoples only completed 5.9 years.&lt;ref&gt;National Household Survey 2008 by Instituto Nacional de Estadística (National Statistics Institute) [http://www.ine.gob.bo/indice/indice.aspx?d1=0402&amp;d2=6]&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the significant progress [[Education in Bolivia|Bolivia]] has made in enhancing access to education in terms of overall school enrolment rates in the last decade, a high drop-out rate, especially among indigenous children is responsible for a persistent education gap between the indigenous and non-indigenous, with 42.4% of indigenous students dropping out before completing primary school compared to only 17.6% of non-indigenous students.&lt;ref&gt;National Household Survey 2008 by Instituto Nacional de Estadística (National Statistics Institute) [http://www.ine.gob.bo/indice/indice.aspx?d1=0402&amp;d2=6]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Killer's Paradise''''' is a 2007 documentary exploring the high murder rate of women that has persisted unsolved in [[Guatemala]] since the end of the [[Guatemalan Civil War]]. The film is a co-production of the [[National Film Board of Canada]] and the [[BBC]] and was directed by Toronto-based journalist and filmmaker [[Giselle Portenier]]. It premiered on 8 March 2007 in Toronto and has been broadcast on multiple channels around the world, including [[DOC: The Documentary Channel]] in the United States.

== General description ==
More than 2,200 women were murdered in Guatemala between 2001 and 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amnestyusa.org/By_Country/Guatemala/page.do?id=1011162&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=30&amp;n3=912 | title = Guatemala: Human Rights Concerns | publisher = Amnesty International USA | author =  | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and countless more raped, tortured, and mutilated. This film displays this epidemic by examining the cases of several murders that occur during and just prior to filming. In particular, the filmmakers follow the family of Claudina Velásquez, a 19-year-old student who was murdered one night after a party with friends. When the case stalls, Claudina's father, accompanied by a camera crew, makes several appearances at the offices of homicide detectives. Initially, Claudina is dismissed as a prostitute, due to the sandals and navel ring she was found wearing. Claudina's father pressures investigators to actively pursue the case, but is repeatedly told that the case has been passed from one investigator to another.

This case and others in the film, like that of an unidentified woman found naked in a dry riverbed, showcase the pervasiveness of the murder of women in Guatemala, and point to numerous reasons that these murders are almost never solved. Witnesses and the family members of victims interviewed in the film speak on camera reluctantly and only as a last resort, and explain that they fear retaliation from the murderers, who are often young gang members or disaffected soldiers, many jobless following the end of major military conflict in Guatemala. The film also displays the unwillingness of authorities to investigate the murders, owing to corruption and fear of retaliation from perpetrators. A pervasive societal machismo and misogyny are also revealed, as when police deem victims wearing makeup, fingernail polish, or supposedly revealing clothing to be prostitutes and decline to investigate their murders. While the film focuses primarily on young women who are abducted off the streets, it also mentions the large number of women who are beaten or murdered by husbands and boyfriends, cases which are rarely reported or prosecuted. Additionally, a law persists whereby a convicted rapist can be acquitted if his victim agrees to marry him, meaning that many victims of "solved" rape cases are coerced into abusive marriages for fear of their lives.

In spite of the continued increase in the murder rate of women, the film is not entirely without hope. The filmmakers are granted an interview with then President [[Óscar Berger]], who dismisses their criticism as merely "pessimistic," and says he is optimistic that new programs, including a national overhaul of the police force and foreign training for homicide investigators, will improve the situation. Director Portenier's criticism of governmental incompetence is met with frustration and disdain, and Berger leaves the interview abruptly, thanking Portenier and grimacing through his anger. One scene shows a large protest march in the capital, Guatemala City, where citizens cordon off the Ministry of Justice with yellow police tape, declaring it a "crime scene of inaction." Another thread of the film follows the sister of one murder victim as she appeals to the [[United States Congress]], eventually gaining an audience in a committee in order to bring international attention to the plight of women in Guatemala.

| In November 2017, ''Battlefront II'' received unfavorable critical attention when its [[loot box]] monetization scheme during its open beta period was revealed, which many felt was a "pay-to-win" scheme since some loot box rewards directly influenced multiplayer gameplay.

== Murders ==
Van Schoor was hired as a security guard after he had served as a police officer.

He would react to the silent alarm when it was triggered in businesses he monitored and to dispatch of the intruders with his 9mm pistol immediately.

Most of his victims were black men and so suspicions were that his murders were racially motivated, but van Schoor denied that and declared the deaths of the burglars by saying that he had "just done his job".&lt;ref name="rich"&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Of The Most Horrific Serial Killers Released From Prison|periodical=The Richest|publisher=|url=http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/most-shocking/10-of-the-most-horrific-serial-killers-released-from-prison/?view=all|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2015-12-09|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=2014-02-09|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imprisonment ==
Van Schoor was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for seven murders and two assassinations. While serving his sentence, according to the statements of a prison employee, he is said to have behaved like an "exemplary prisoner" and to have demonstrated leadership qualities.

After serving twelve years in prison, Van Schoor was released on parole.

'''Lule Saami language''' ''(julevsámegiella)'' is a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Sami languages|Saami]] language spoken in [[Lule Lappmark]], i.e. around the [[Lule River]], [[Sweden]] and in the northern parts of [[Nordland]] county in [[Norway]], especially [[Tysfjord]] municipality, where Lule Saami is an official language. It is written in the [[Latin script]], having an official [[alphabet]].

==Status==
With 1,500 to 2,000 speakers it is the second largest of all Saami languages. It is reported that the number of native speakers is in sharp decline among the younger generations. The language has, however, been standardised in 1983 and elaborately cultivated ever since.

==Phonology==
{{no sources|date=September 2018}}
===Consonants===

Some analyses of Lule Saami phonology may include preaspirated stops and affricates ({{IPA|/hp/}}, {{IPA|/ht/}}, {{IPA|/ht͡s/}}, {{IPA|/ht͡ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/hk/}}) and pre-stopped or pre-glottalised nasals (voiceless {{IPA|/pm/}}, {{IPA|/tn/}}, {{IPA|/tɲ/}}, {{IPA|/kŋ/}} and voiced {{IPA|/bːm/}}, {{IPA|/dːn/}}, {{IPA|/dːɲ/}}, {{IPA|/gːŋ/}}). However, these can be treated as clusters for the purpose of phonology, since they are clearly composed of two segments and only the first of these lengthens in quantity 3. The terms "preaspirated" and "pre-stopped" will be used in this article to describe these combinations for convenience.

* Stops before a [[homorganic]] nasal (pre-stopped nasals) are realised as [[unreleased stop]]s.
* {{IPA|/v/}} is realised as a labiodental fricative {{IPA|[v]}} in the syllable onset (before a vowel), and as bilabial {{IPA|[w]}} in the syllable coda (in a consonant cluster).

===Vowels===
Lule Saami possesses the following vowels:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"

| {{IPA|ea̯}} || {{IPA|oɑ̯}}
|-
! Open
| colspan="2" | {{IPA|a}} || colspan="2" | {{IPA|aː}} || colspan="2" |
|}

* {{IPA|/ea̯/}} can be realised as a true diphthong, or a long monophtong {{IPA|[ɛː]}}.
* Long {{IPA|/eː/}} and the diphthongs {{IPA|/ea̯/}} and {{IPA|/oɑ̯/}} occur only in stressed syllables.
* Long {{IPA|/iː/}} and {{IPA|/uː/}} are very rare, as is short {{IPA|/e/}}. They also only occur in stressed syllables.
* Short {{IPA|/o/}} and long {{IPA|/oː/}} can occur in unstressed syllables, but only when a preceding stressed syllable contains {{IPA|/o/}}.

====Consonant length and gradation====

Consonants, including [[consonant cluster|clusters]], that occur after a stressed syllable can occur in multiple distinctive length types, or quantities. These are conventionally labelled quantity 1, 2 and 3 or Q1, Q2 and Q3 for short. The consonants of a word alternate in a process known as [[consonant gradation]], where consonants appear in different quantities depending on the specific grammatical form. Normally, one of the possibilities is named the ''strong grade'', while the other is named ''weak grade''. The consonants of a weak grade are normally quantity 1 or 2, while the consonants of a strong grade are normally quantity 2 or 3.

* '''Quantity 1''' includes any single consonant. It originates from [[Proto-Samic|Proto-Saamic]] single consonants in the weak grade.
* '''Quantity 2''' includes any combination of consonants (including two of the same) with a short consonant in the coda of the preceding syllable. It originates from Proto-Saamic single consonants in the strong grade, as well as combinations of two consonants in the weak grade.
* '''Quantity 3''' includes any combination of consonants (including two of the same) with a long consonant in the coda of the preceding syllable. It originates from Proto-Saamic combinations of two consonants in the strong grade.

Throughout this article and related articles, consonants that are part of different syllables are written with two consonant letters in IPA, while the lengthening of consonants in quantity 3 is indicated with an IPA length mark ({{IPA|ː}}).

Not all consonants can occur in every quantity type. The following limitations exist:
* Single {{IPA|/h/}} is restricted to quantity 1, and does not alternate.
* Single {{IPA|/j/}} is also restricted to quantity 1, but alternates with {{IPA|/ɟ/}}.
* Voiced stops and affricates only occur in quantity 3, except for {{IPA|/ɟ/}} which can also occur in quantity 2.
* {{IPA|/ʎ/}} occurs in quantity 2 and 3, but not in quantity 1.

When a consonant can occur in all three quantities, quantity 3 is termed "overlong".

===Phonological processes===

====Umlaut====

Umlaut is a process whereby a diphthong in a stressed syllable changes depending on the vowel in the next syllable.

The first type of umlaut, causes an alternation between {{IPA|/ea̯/}} and {{IPA|/ie̯/}} in words whose stems end with unstressed {{IPA|/ie̯/}}. For such words, these two diphthongs can be considered variants of each other, while in words whose stems end with another vowel, these vowels remain distinct. The following table shows the different patterns that occur with different following vowels:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! Second vowel !! aː !! uo̯ !! ie̯ !! a !! u !! i
|-
! Stem ends in /ie̯/
| colspan="2" | ea̯ || ie̯ || colspan="2" | ea̯ || ie̯
|-
! Stem ends in another vowel
| colspan="2" | ea̯ || &amp;mdash; || colspan="3" | ea̯
|-
! Stem ends in another vowel
| colspan="2" | ie̯ || &amp;mdash; || colspan="3" | ie̯
|}

The second type of umlaut, called "diphthong simplification" or "monophthongization", is similar to its Northern Saami counterpart, but works differently. The diphthongs {{IPA|/ea̯/}} and {{IPA|/oɑ̯/}} become {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} respectively, if:
* The vowel in the next syllable is short (thus including also {{IPA|/a/}}), and
* The following consonant is quantity 1 or 2.
The diphthongs {{IPA|/ie̯/}} and {{IPA|/uo̯/}} are unaffected. The reverse process also occurs, turning the long vowels back into diphthongs if the consonant becomes quantity 3 or the vowel in the next syllable becomes long.

The third type of umlaut, progressive umlaut, works in the other direction. It causes the ''unstressed'' vowels {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} to be rounded to {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} respectively, if the preceding ''stressed'' vowel is short {{IPA|/o/}}.

====Unstressed vowel lengthening====

If a stressed syllable contains a short vowel followed by a single (quantity 1) consonant, then a short vowel in the following syllable is lengthened.
* {{wikt-lang|smj|dahkat}} "to do" ~ ''dagá'' (1st p. sg. present)
* {{wikt-lang|smj|bådnjåt}} "to twist" ~ ''bånjå̄'' (1st p. sg. present)

==Dialects==

* Northern dialects: [[Sörkaitum]], [[Sirkas]] and [[Jåkkåkaska]] in Sweden, [[Tysfjord]] in Norway
* Southern dialects: [[Tuorpon]] in Sweden
* Forest dialects: [[Gällivare]] and [[Serri]] in Sweden

Features of the northern dialects of Lule Saami are:
* Long {{IPA|/aː/}} is also rounded to {{IPA|/oː/}} after {{IPA|/o/}} in a first syllable.

Features of the southern dialects of Lule Saami are:
* Umlaut of short {{IPA|/a/}} to {{IPA|/e/}} before {{IPA|/i/}}.

Traditionally, the character n-acute (Ń/ń) has been used to represent the {{IPA|[ŋ]}} sound, found, for example, in the English word "so'''ng'''". In place of n-acute (available in [[Unicode]] and mechanical type writers, but not in [[Latin-1]] or traditional Nordic [[keyboard layout|keyboards]]), many have used ñ or even ng. In modern orthography, such as in the official publications of the Swedish government and the recently published translation of the New Testament, it is usually replaced with [[ŋ]], in accordance with the orthography of many other Saami languages.

==Grammar==

===Cases===

Lule Saami has seven [[grammatical case|case]]s:

====Nominative====

Like the other [[Uralic languages]], the [[nominative]] singular is unmarked and indicates the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].
The nominative plural is also unmarked and is always formally the same as the [[genitive]] singular.

====Genitive====

The ''genitive'' singular is unmarked and looks the same as the [[nominative]] plural. The genitive plural is marked by an ''-j''. The genitive is used:

*to indicate possession
*with prepositions
*with postpositions.

====Accusative====

The [[accusative]] is the direct [[Object (grammar)|object]] case and it is marked with ''-v'' in the singular. In the plural, its marker is ''-t'', which is preceded by the plural marker ''-j''.

====Inessive====

The [[inessive]] marker is ''-n'' in the singular and the plural, when it is then preceded by the plural marker ''-j''. This case is used to indicate:

*where something is
*who has possession of something

====Illative====

The [[illative]] marker is ''-j'' in the singular and ''-da'' in the plural, which is preceded by the plural marker ''-i'', making it look the same as the plural [[accusative]]. This case is used to indicate:

*where something is going
*who is receiving something
*the indirect [[Object (grammar)|object]]

====Elative====

The [[elative case|elative]] marker is ''-s'' in the singular and the plural, when it is then preceded by the plural marker ''-j''. This case is used to indicate:

*where something is coming from

====Comitative====

The [[comitative]] marker in the singular is ''-jn'' and ''-j'' in the plural, which means that it looks like the genitive plural. The comitative is used to state ''with whom or what'' something was done.

===Pronouns===

The personal pronouns have three numbers - singular, plural and [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]]. The following table contains personal pronouns in the nominative and genitive/accusative cases.

{| class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
!English
!nominative
!English
!genitive
|-
|First person (singular) || '''I''' || mån || '''my''' || muv

The '''Marcel Linsman Prize''' (or '''Linsman Prize''') is a Belgian prize awarded every 3 years by the influential AILg (Association des Ingenieurs Diplomés de la Université de Liège), a Belgian academic association of engineers, to living scientists for excellence in the biomedical sciences. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.ailg.be/index.php?page=prix-marcel-linsman|title= Prix Marcel Linsman|publisher=Association des Ingenieurs Diplomés de la Université de Liège|accessdate = 26 November 2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The prize is restricted to researchers with a medical or engineering degree having performed research in Belgium. The age limit is 45 years but there is no restriction on the citizenship. For many years, the preference has been given to researchers in the field of neuroscience. This prize is awarded in memory of Marcel Linsman (1912-1989), distinguished University Professor.

The prize is usually awarded during an official ceremony taking place in one Belgian university during which two other prestigious prizes in different fields are awarded. Similar to other prestigious prize ceremonies, the recipients deliver a scientific presentation of their research.

The reputation achieved by this prize is ubiquitously recognized amongst academics in Europe.

== Marcel Linsman ==
Born in Liège on 22 June 1912, he studied mathematical sciences at the University of Liège, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1934. In 1937, he received his doctorate, with the highest distinction" He was appointed assistant professor at Liège in 1938, and in 1964, full professor.  In 1943, he became interested in numerical calculation and recognized immediately the electronic possibilities.  He moved to Harvard University in 1947. From 1951 to 1955, he managed the development of one of the earliest European electronic computers, known as Machine I.R.S.I.A. His interest then took him into non-numerical applications of the computer. Starting with automatic translation, he initiated many projects, including teaching informatics and medical applications. Throughout his career, he was the recipient of many awards.

In IFIP, he was present from the first Council meeting in Rome until 1971, representing the Belgian member society. He was also active in the Technical Committee on Education (TC3). During the time IFIP was registered in Belgium, 1962 through 1967, he served as IFIP Assistant Secretary and handled all legal matters for IFIP.  In 1974, he was in the first group to receive the IFIP Silver Core Award.

Marcel Linsman died during the night from 18 to 19 April 1989.  A foundation in his name has been established to promote scientific excellence in the field of biomedical sciences.

'''Moroccan Jews''' ({{lang-ar|اليهود المغاربة|al-Yehud al-Magharibah}} {{lang-he-n|יהודים מרוקאים}} ''Yehudim Maroka'im'') are the [[Jews]] who live or have lived in the area of [[North Africa]]n country of [[Morocco]]. Some Jews migrated to this area and settled among the [[Berbers]]. They were later met by a second wave of migration from the [[Iberian peninsula]] in the period immediately preceding and following the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]], when the Jews were expelled from [[Kingdom of Spain|kingdoms of Spain]], and soon afterwards, from [[Portugal]] as well. This second immigration wave deeply modified [[History of the Jews in Morocco|Moroccan jewry]], who largely embraced the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[Sephardic|Sephardic liturgy]], making the Moroccan Jews switch to a mostly Sephardic identity.

At its peak in the 1940s, Morocco's Jewish population exceeded 250,000, but due to the [[migration of Moroccan Jews to Israel]] and other nations, including [[Operation Yachin]] from 1961 to 1964, this number has been reduced to approximately 5,000. The vast majority of Moroccan Jews now [[Moroccan Jews in Israel|live in Israel]], where they constitute the second-largest Jewish community, approximatively half a million. Other communities are found in [[France]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]], the [[United States]] and [[South America]], mainly in [[Venezuela]], [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Jews in Morocco}}
[[File:A Jewish house in Mogador by Darondeau 1807 1841.jpg|thumb|150px|Etching of Jewish home in [[Mogador]], [[Darondeau]] (1807–1841)]]
Moroccan Jews constitute an ancient community, immigrating to the region as early as 70 CE.  Until the 1950s the majority of Morocco's Jews were still living in Morocco. In accordance with the norms of the Islamic legal system, Jewish Moroccans had separate legal courts pertaining to "personal law" under which communities (Muslim ''[[sharia]]'', Christian [[Canon law]] and Jewish ''[[halakha]]'' law abiding) were allowed to rule themselves under their own system. After Israel's independence in 1948, and due to domestic strife in the 1950s, the next several decades saw waves of Jewish emigration to Israel, France and Canada. Moroccan Jews emigrated for a variety of reasons. Some have emigrated to Israel for religious reasons, some faced persecution, and others left for better economic prospects than they faced in post-colonial Morocco. With every Arab-Israeli war, tensions between Arabs and Jews would rise, sparking more Jewish emigration. By the time of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, the majority of Morocco's Jewish population had emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4350488,00.html|title=Morocco film searches out Jews who left|author=|date=|website=YnetNews.com|access-date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a protectorate of France, parts of Morocco were heavily influenced by French culture, while the same is true of the portions of the country that belonged to Spain. Traditionally, the Jews were classified as being French-Moroccan or Spanish-Moroccan depending on where in Morocco they lived, and remnants of these classifications can be felt today. These differences are reflected in language, foods, last names and even liturgy.

Most Jews in Morocco lived in desolate areas during the late 1930s. This was in part due to increased taxation by the French protectorate. In 1936, a Jewish man, named Léon Blum, was appointed as prime minister of France. This gave some Moroccan Jews hope that they may be able to become French citizens at some point. Nearby Algerian Jews were granted right of passage to France, and this only furthered the desire of Moroccan Jews to embrace French culture to the extent of the Algerian Jews.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kenbib|first=Mohammed|date=2014-08-08|title=Moroccan Jews and the Vichy regime, 1940–42|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13629387.2014.950523|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=540–553|doi=10.1080/13629387.2014.950523|issn=1362-9387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small community of around 2,000–2,500 Jews live in Morocco today. However, in a rapidly increasing trend, young men from the community are emigrating to Israel and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4354823,00.html|title=Moroccan Jews study high-tech in Israel|author=|date=|website=YnetNews.com|access-date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, according to ''[[The Economist]]'', "No Arab country has gone to the lengths of Morocco to revive its Jewish heritage."&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Morocco’s little idyll of Jewish-Muslim coexistence|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21730897-essaouira-sets-example-rest-middle-east-moroccos-little-idyll|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has restored 110 synagogues and has the [[Arab world]]’s [[Moroccan Jewish Museum|only Jewish museum]].&lt;ref name="veconomist" /&gt; More than 50,000 Israelis visit Morocco annually.&lt;ref name="veconomist" /&gt;

* Morocco: In 2012 it was estimated that 2,000–2,500 Jews still lived in Morocco, mainly in [[Casablanca]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Other towns are said to have smaller, aging populations.
* Israel: The 1950s saw large waves of Jewish emigration from Morocco to Israel. Many Moroccan Jews were transferred to peripheral [[development towns]] while others settled in larger, established cities. Today, Jews of Moroccan descent can be found all across Israel.
* France: Large communities in France include [[Paris]], [[Marseille]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Lyon]] and [[Nice]].
* Argentina: Mainly in [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Rosario]].

* Canada: In the 1950s Canada began extending visas to Jews from Morocco. Large communities developed in Montreal and Toronto. Moroccans were attracted to Canada because of its high quality of life and to Montreal in particular because of the French language. Toronto is known for its significant Moroccan population originating from cities such as [[Tangiers]] and [[Tetouan]]. In the recent past, however, an emergence of French-Moroccan musical liturgy and customs has been noticed even in this dominant Moroccan city. For example, the traditional Moroccan Bakashot, classical music sung by Sephardic Jews in the winter months across countries in the Middle East on Friday night, has come to life in recent productions by Magen David Congregation and Abir Ya'akob Congregation. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
* Venezuela: Concentrated mainly in [[Caracas]].
* Gibraltar: The Jewish community in Gibraltar originates from Tangiers and Tetouan.

== Jewish quarters in Morocco ==
The Jewish quarters in Morocco were called ''[[Mellah|mellahs]]''. Jews in Morocco were considered &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[Dhimmi|dhimmis]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; under Muslim law, meaning that they were seen as an inferior religious group, that were distinguished from the Muslim majority, and were prevented from participating in certain activities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Deshen, Shlomo. "Urban Jews in Sherifian Morocco." Middle Eastern Studies 20, no. 4 (1984): 212-23. doi:10.1080/00263208408700607&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[Dhimmi|dhimmis]]'' such as Jews were tolerated, following the [[Pact of Umar]] in the 7th century, unlike the policy of intolerance that the Christians practiced with the Jews at that time in Europe. Sultans put Jews in the ''mellahs,'' as what most see as an attempt to ostracize the Jews, and keep them from being exposed to insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;Deshen, Shlomo. "Urban Jews in Sherifian Morocco." ''Middle Eastern Studies''20, no. 4 (1984): 214 . doi:10.1080/00263208408700607.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish quarters in Moroccan cities were called ''Mellahs.'' The Sultans also wanted the Jews to be protected for political reasons. An attack on minorities was seen as an attack on the Sultan's power. The Sultan put the Jews in the ''Mellah'' for their safety, as well as to protect the Sultan rulings from being tested by insurgents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The word ''mellah'' is similar to the Hebrew word for salt, ''melach (מלח)''. The term ''mellah'' refers to the salty, marshy area where the Jews of Northern Morocco were originally transferred and gathered.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus, Ira M.

''The American Historical Review''113, no. 3 (2008): 946-47. doi:10.1086/ahr.113.3.946.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''mellah'' was not a ghetto and was not structured in a way similar to Jewish quarters in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus, Ira M.

==Culture==
Moroccan Jewry has developed as a hybrid of the many cultures that have shaped Morocco itself, namely Jewish, Arab, Berber, French and Spanish.

===Music===
[[File:Fête juive à Tétouan, Alfred Dehodencq, 1865.jpg|thumb|Jewish Festival in Tetuan, [[Alfred Dehodencq]], 1865, [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme|Paris Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]
Even before the arrival of [[Sephardi Jews]] to Morocco, Moroccan Jews performed and developed the traditions of the [[Andalusian classical music]] and introduced it into their [[Liturgical music]]. In his book "Jews of Andalusia and the Maghreb" on the musical traditions in Jewish societies of North Africa, [[Haim Zafrani]] writes: "''In Spain and Morocco, Jews were ardent maintainers of Andalusian music and the zealous guardians of its old traditions ....''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Juifs d'Andalousie et du Maghreb|series=Références Maisonneuve et Larose|author=Haïm Zafrani |publisher=Maisonneuve &amp; Larose|year=2002|page=228|isbn=978-2-7068-1629-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cdsEySgTqxAC&amp;pg=PA228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henna===
Traditional Henna parties usually take place within the week before a special occasion, such as a wedding, [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]], or baby showers. During pre-wedding Henna parties, the Matriarch of the family (often the grandmother) smudges [[henna]] in the palm of the bride and groom to symbolically bestow the new couple with good health, fertility, wisdom, and security. The henna is believed in Moroccan tradition to protect the couple from demons. The grandmother covers the henna, a dough-like paste produced by mixing crushed henna plant leaves with water, in order to lock in body heat and generate a richer color. Normally, the henna will dye skin orange for up to 2 weeks. In Moroccan folklore, the bride is exempt of her household duties until the henna completely fades. After the bride and groom are blessed with the henna, the guests also spread henna on their palms to bring good luck.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

===Clothing===
Although most Moroccan Jews tend to dress in styles of their adopted countries, traditional Moroccan clothing is sometimes worn during celebrations ([[Mimouna]], weddings, Bar Miṣvas, etc.) or even during more intimate gatherings, such as Shabbat dinner. Men usually wear a white jellaba ([[jellabiya]]) cloak while women wear more ornate [[kaftans]].

===Mimouna===
[[Mimouna]] is celebrated by many Moroccan Jews on the night following the last day of Passover. It has spread to be an almost national holiday in Israel where it is particularly prevalent in the city of Haifa.

==Religious observance==
{{Main|Minhag Morocco}}
Many Rabanim have passed through and sojourned in Morocco leaving behind great influence. In 2008, a project to preserve Moroccan Torah and the words of its Ḥakhamim was initiated. DarkeAbotenou.com was created by a few members of the Toronto Sephardic Community; devoting their time and effort to increasing global awareness of the customs and laws that Jews of Morocco live with every day. Daily emails are sent in both English and French containing the customs, laws, and traditional liturgy of both the French and Spanish parts of Morocco. This daily publication is currently broadcast in both English and French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkeabotenou.com/blog/about/ Darké Abotenou » About]. Darkeabotenou.com (2008-11-21). Retrieved on 4 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgy===
The observer of a typical Moroccan Jewish prayer service will note the presence of Oriental motifs in the melodies. However, unlike the tunes of Eastern rites (Syrian, Iraqi, etc.),  which were influenced by Middle Eastern sounds, Moroccan Jewish religious tunes have a uniquely Andalusian feel. Furthermore, just as Eastern liturgical melodies are organized into Maqams, Moroccan liturgy can be classified by Noubas. The Moroccan prayer rite itself is also unique among Sephardic customs. The Moroccan [[nusach]] has many unique components but has also incorporated numerous Ashkenazic customs due to the country's proximity and exposure to Europe. Some customs of the Moroccan nusach include:
* Two blessing for [[Hallel]]: One blessing (ligmor et ha'Hallel) is said when the full Hallel is recited, while the other blessing (likro et ha'Hallel) is said when the abridged Hallel is recited. Other Sephardim omit the latter.
* Yiru Enenu: The blessing commencing with the words ''Yiru Enenu'' (translation: Our eyes shall see) is recited after Hashkivenu in the Arvit service after the Sabbath. Many Ashkenazim say this passage on every weekday night after Hashkivenu. This custom is discussed in [[Tosafot]] of Tractate Berakhot 4a.
* Le'David: Before the Arvit service after the Sabbath, three psalms are recited in a unique tune said to be the same tune that King David's soldiers recited them in. The psalms are Chapters 144, 67 and 44 (in that order). Some congregations begin this service with Chapter 16 in a tune that leads up to the other three psalms.
* [[Pesukei Dezimra]]: The opening verse of [[Psalm 30]] ("Mizmor Shir Ḥanukat Habayit LeDavid") is added to the remainder of the Psalm during Shaḥarit of Hanuka. Other Sepharadim begin with "Aromimkha" even on Ḥanuka.
* Shir HaShirim: This is usually read between [[Mincha]] and [[Kabbalat Shabbat]] on the Sabbath eve. Other Sephardic groups tend to read it before Minḥa. Moroccan Jews chant Shir HaShirim with a unique [[cantillation]]. A common practice is for a different congregant to sing each chapter.
* Before the repetition of the [[Amidah]] in Shaḥarit and Musaf of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, the hymn "Hashem sham'ati shim'akha yareti" (Translation:  Hashem, I have heard your speech and was awed) is sung. The origin of this verse is [[Habakkuk]] 3:2.
* The Moroccan tune for [[Torah reading|Torah Reading]] is unique to the Moroccan tradition, unlike all other [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]] who merely utilize different variations of the Yerushalmi tune.
* Some of the Moroccan Piyutim / Jewish Prayer Melodies and Songs - are said to come from the songs of the Leviim / Levites - that were sung on the steps leading to the Beit HaMikdash / Holy Temple in Jerusalem.

===Religious customs===
* [[Psalm 29]] and [[Lekha Dodi]] are recited sitting down in the Kabbalat Shabbat service.
* Packets of salt are distributed to congregants on the second night of Passover, marking the first counting of the 'Omer. The significance of salt includes the commemoration of the sacrifices in the Temple and other Kabbalistic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kehilacentre.com/uploads/store/salt_article.pdf "Salt of Omer" in the Kehila Centre Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704131203/http://www.kehilacentre.com/uploads/store/salt_article.pdf |date=2008-07-04 }}. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pirke Avot]] is read during the [[Musaf]] service of Shabbat between Passover and [[Shavuot]]. As well, the custom is for pre-Bar Miṣva boys to read each chapter, and this is usually performed with a special tune.
* After reciting the hamotzie blessing over bread, there is a custom to dip the bread into salt while reciting "Adonai melekh, Adonai malakh, Adonai yimlokh le'olam va'ed" (Translation: God reigns; God has reigned; God will reign for ever and ever). This "verse" is actually a compilation of three verses taken from Psalms and Exodus. The validity of this custom has been disputed among Moroccan [[Poskim]] since it may constitute an interruption of a blessing.
* Before the Magid section of the [[Passover Seder]], the [[Seder plate]] is raised and passed over the heads of those present while reciting "Bibhilu yaṣanu mi–miṣrayim, halaḥma 'anya bené ḥorin" (Translation: In haste we went out of Egypt [with our] bread of affliction, [now we are] free people). It can be heard here.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|DwjIcjE93ds|Pesah פסח – Bibhilou בבהילו – Jo 'Amar ג'ו עמר z"l}}. Retrieved on 4 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years the Moroccan Jews' [[DNA]] was examined and studied by numerous studies, the general image of it showed that in terms of [[Y-DNA]] it was mainly from the same [[Levant]]ine source as the vast majority of the world's Jewry, meaning that they too are descendants of the Ancient [[Hebrews]]/[[Israelites]] from the [[Biblical timeline for ancient Israel and Judah|Biblical times]]. In the case of [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi Jews]] (in particular Moroccan Jews), who are apparently closely related, the non-Jewish component is mainly [[southern European]].&lt;ref name=zooss&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Biol Direct |year=2010 |volume=5 |issue=57 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-5-57 |title=The Origin of Eastern European Jews Revealed by Autosomal, Sex Chromosomal and mtDNA Polymorphisms |first=Avshalom |last=Zoossmann-Diskin |pmc=2964539 |pmid=20925954 |url=http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/57 |page=57 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116090339/http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/57 |archivedate=November 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic research shows that about 27% of Moroccan Jews descend from one female ancestor.&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/Genetics-and-the-Jewish-identity|title=Genetics and the Jewish identity|work=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of the Jewish populations of North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia, Libya) was the subject of further detailed study in 2008 by Doron Behar et al.&lt;ref name="Behar2008b"/&gt; The analysis concludes that Jews from this region do not share the [[haplogroup]]s of the mitochondrial DNA haplogroups (M1 and U6) that are typical of  the North African Berber and Arab populations. Similarly, while the frequency of haplogroups L, associated with [[sub-Saharan Africa]], are present in approximately  20–25% at the Berber populations studied, these haplogroups are only present in 1.3%, 2.7% and 3.6% respectively of Jews from Morocco, Tunisia and Libya.&lt;ref name="Behar2008b"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behar|first=Doran M.|last2=Metspalu|first2=Ene|last3=Kivisild|first3=Toomas|last4=Rosset|first4=Saharon|last5=Tzur|first5=Shay|last6=Hadid|first6=Yarin|last7=Yudkovsky|first7=Guennady|last8=Rosengarten|first8=Dror|last9=Pereira|first9=Luisa|date=|year=2008|title=Counting the founders: the matrilineal genetic ancestry of the Jewish Diaspora|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=3|issue=4|pages=e2062|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2062B|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002062|issn=1932-6203|pmc=2323359|pmid=18446216|via=|editor1-last=MacAulay|editor1-first=Vincent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behar et al. conclude that it is unlikely that North African Jews have significant Arab, or Berber admixture, "consistent with social restrictions imposed by religious restrictions," or [[endogamy]]. This study also found genetic similarities between the Ashkenazi and North African Jews of European mitochondrial DNA pools, but differences between both of these of the diaspora and Jews from the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Behar2008b" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6629">'''Norbert Vollertsen''' (born 10 February 1958 in [[Düsseldorf]]) is a German doctor and [[human rights]] activist.

Vollertsen practiced medicine in [[North Korea]] from 1999 to 2001 with the Cap Anamur Committee, a [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental cooperation organization]]. In August 1999, he and Francois Large, another aid worker, donated their skin to Pak Jong Thae, a tractor factory worker in [[Haeju]], [[South Hwanghae Province|South Hwanghae]], who had suffered burns over three-quarters of his body and underwent three [[skin grafting]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germans donate their skin to Korean patient|publisher=Korean Central News Agency|date=1999-08-05|accessdate=2007-07-10|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1999/9908/news08/05.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his contribution, Vollertsen received the official Democratic People's Republic of Korea's [[Order of Friendship 2nd Class|Friendship Medal]] for his humanitarian assistance later that same month, in a ceremony attended by [[Supreme People's Assembly]] vice-president [[Yang Hyong Sop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DPRK Friendship Medal awarded to Germans|publisher=Korean Central News Agency|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1999/9908/news08/23.htm|date=1999-08-23|accessdate=2007-07-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012050824/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1999/9908/news08/23.htm|archivedate=2014-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also given a pass that allowed him to travel through the country freely, which was very unusual for a foreigner.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/2967889.stm|title=Westerner's help for N Korean refugees|date=2003-04-23|accessdate=2007-07-10|publisher=BBC News|last=Edmonds|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As he traveled in his capacity as an emergency physician, tending to the illnesses and injuries of common North Koreans in the countryside, he struggled with a nearly non-existent healthcare system, abject [[Poverty in North Korea|poverty]] and growing proof of a network of political prisons in North Korea that enforced the flow of wealth from the citizenry to the [[Pyongyang]]-based [[military|Korean People's Army]] and the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] which was then headed by [[Kim Jong-il]]. Using smuggled cameras, he obtained photos and films of flagrant, large-scale [[human rights abuses|Human rights violations in North Korea]]. In particular, mass starvation was used as a tool of political control. He began collecting evidence of abuses, which he passed to a visiting [[United States Congress]] man, an act for which he was put under surveillance. Despite this Vollertsen continued to speak out against the North Korean government, which soon lost patience and forced him to leave North Korea in January 2001. Soon after returning home, he gave an interview about his experiences in North Korea, which the North Korean government denounced.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2001/200101/news01/16.htm|date=2001-01-16|accessdate=2007-07-10|publisher=Korean Central News Agency|title=Spokesman for DPRK FDRC on letter from German "Cap Anamur" Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Korean government has portrayed him as a dishonest media manipulator who is suffering from mental instability. His wife, reacting to his decision to stay in South Korea as an anti-Kim activist, divorced him and is raising their children with a partner. "My wife blamed me for not taking care of my family. She said my vision, my goals, my projects, were worth much more to me. And afterwards, I realised she was right. I do not want to sacrifice my family. But I know my wife and her partner are taking care of my children, and that they are safe and healthy. But the North Korean children are not", said Vollertsen in 2003.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

In September 2006, Vollertsen claimed that he had been attacked by a gang and had been run over by a taxi while in [[Seoul]] prior to giving a speech on North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Things Getting Darker for Vollertson|url=http://www.rjkoehler.com/2006/09/25/things-getting-darker-for-vollertson/|date=2006-09-25|accessdate=2007-07-09|last=Koehler|first=Robert|publisher=The Marmot's Hole|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040341/http://www.rjkoehler.com/2006/09/25/things-getting-darker-for-vollertson/|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written the book ''Inside North Korea: Diary of a Mad Place'', published in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|isbn=1-893554-87-2|oclc=226117315|last=Vollertson|first=Norbert|publisher=Encounter Books|publication-place=San Francisco|year=2004|title=Inside North Korea: Diary of a Mad Place}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was earlier translated into Japanese by Midori Segi and published in Japan in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=瀬木碧 [Midori Segi]|publisher=草思社 [Sōshisha]|script-title=ja:北朝鮮を知りすぎた医者国境からの報告 |trans-title=The doctor who knew too much about North Korea: A report from inside the borders|isbn=4-7942-1090-6|oclc=48952380|id={{JPNO|20208614}}|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philosophical Association of Japan''' ('''PAJ'''; 日本哲学会 ''Nippon Tetsugakukai'') is the largest [[learned society]] for [[philosophy]] in Japan. The purpose of the association is to "promote the study of philosophy and active interaction among researchers from philosophy, working as a forum to discuss on research, education and the role of philosophy in the modern world." The association was founded by Japanese philosophers in 1949, with Amano Teiyū (September 30 1884 – March 6 1980) being elected its first president. Since 1952, the association has published the journal {{Nihongo|''Philosophy''|哲学|Tetsugaku}} annually, with Volume 69 releasing in April 2018.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philosophy-japan.org/en/|title=History of the Philosophical Association of Japan (PAJ)|last=|first=|date=|website=Philosophy Japan|language=ja, en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/philosophy/-char/en|title=Philosophy (Tetsugaku)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.jstage.jst.go.jp|language=en, Japanese|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The PAJ was founded in 1949 by Japanese philosophers, with Amano Teiyū being elected its first president. Beginning in 1952, mainly through the efforts of presidents Amano, Ide Takashi (March 10 1892 – March 9 1980), Shimomura Toratarō (August 17 1902 – January 22 1995), Mutai Risaku (August 8 1880 – July 5 1974), and Watsuji Tetsurō (1889 – 1960){{Citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=Watsuji doesn't appear to be in the list of past presidents - who is he? Why is he listed here? Has his name been romanized incorrectly?}}, the first edition of the association's journal {{Nihongo|''Philosophy''|哲学|Tetsugaku}} was published "with the primary purpose of offering occasions for the exchange of opinions and information about research in philosophy inside and outside of Japan".

== Activities ==

*'''Annual conference'''
**The PAJ organizes a three day conference during which it hosts oral presentations, a general [[symposium]], a "societies symposium", international sessions, joint research workshops, PAJ working group workshops, and the general assembly. It most recently held the 77th conference on May 18-20, 2018 at [[Kobe University]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1990">While '''[[polygamous]] [[marriages]]''' are not legally recognized under the [[civil marriage]] laws of '''[[Namibia]]''', a bill was successfully passed in 2003, based on the model in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lac.org.na/projects/grap/Pdf/custmar2003.pdf RECOGNITION OF CUSTOMARY MARRIAGES IN SOUTH AFRICA: A MODEL FOR NAMIBIA?]&lt;/ref&gt; which recognizes polygamous unions under customary law; affording a generous amount of benefits to polygamous unions, ranging from inheritance rights to child custody. It has been estimated that nearly one in seven women in Namibia live in polygamous relationships, which has resulted in large numbers of unmarried men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genderindex.org/country/namibia Namibia: Family Code]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since May 2009, a debate concerning legalizing civil polygamous marriages has been ongoing throughout the parliament in Namibia. The bill has faced both praise and fierce opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogcatalog.com/blog/onelove-southern-africa/c1483783b4b34ec42e61016bfa005a02 Namibia debates polygamy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723055704/http://www.blogcatalog.com/blog/onelove-southern-africa/c1483783b4b34ec42e61016bfa005a02 |date=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been past attempts to outlaw polygamous marriages (including under customary law), which have received about an equal reaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unam.na/centres/hrdc/7_nternational_human_rights_norms_and_standards.pdf Nico Horn: International human rights norms and standards: The development of Namibian case and statutory law.]&lt;/ref&gt; A bill that would have provided pension benefits to the spouses of a deceased polygamous president was voted down in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lac.org.na/news/inthenews/pdf/poligamy.pdf Polygamy]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3572">'''''Pot belge''''' (French for  "Belgian mix" or "Belgian stew", sometimes translated as '''Belgian pot''') is a mixture of drugs illegally used by cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-04/jail-time-for-belgian-pot-dealers/1794040|title=Jail time for 'Belgian pot' dealers|last=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=July 4, 2006|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]]|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/10/tourdefrance.cycling|title=Ten years on from the Tour of Shame that blew the lid off organised doping|last=Fotheringham|first=William|date=10 July 2008|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term is commonly used to describe a mixture of drugs, variously constituted from [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], [[caffeine]], [[amphetamines]], and other [[analgesics]].  N.B. the use of the French word ''pot'' is not a reference to [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], and this drug is not normally associated with ''pot belge''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tdfblog.com/2005/03/ag2r_official_a.html AG2R official arrested in 'pot belge' probe]&lt;/ref&gt; A French reference also lists morphine in the mix, and notes that it can also be called "insane person mix",&lt;ref&gt;Bacquaert, Patrick (30 June 2006) [http://www.irbms.com/rubriques/Dopage/pot-belge.php Pot Belge] Institut Régional du Bien-être de la Médecine et du Sport santé en Nord Pas de Calais&lt;/ref&gt; though it's unclear whether this refers to the potential results of its use, or the suggestion that "you have to be crazy to take it."

The mixture has become widely associated with the world of professional cycling where it was used for many years, before the institution of highly regulated testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200107160045 The Tour must go on]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are suggestions that its use among amateur participants has been on the increase as both a recreational and a (relatively cheap) performance-enhancing drug.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/jul/05/fitness Why drugs are still a scourge]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his memoir 'Prisonnier du dopage', former pro cyclist [[Philippe Gaumont]] describes using ''pot belge'' for winter training purposes more than as aid during competition: "J'ai toujours entendu les anciens dire que prendre les amphétamines pour une grande sortie d'entraînement aide à 'débloquer le moteur'" (rough translation from French: "I've always heard old timers say that taking amphetamines before a training ride helps to 'unclog the motor'"). Gaumont describes his use of ''pot belge'' during a seven-hour training ride of the Cofidis team in the mountains at Arcalis in 1997, where he easily outdistanced the team's climbers thanks to the drug. After that, he became dependent on the ''pot belge'' for training: "Dès que j'étais mal dans ma peau, je prenais du pot belge" (translation: "I'd use ''pot belge'' as soon as I didn't feel so good").&lt;ref&gt;''Prisonnier du dopage'' (Paris: Editions Grasset &amp; Fasquelle, 2005): 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of ''pot belge'' became more widely known during the 2006 Bordeaux-based trial following 2004's "Cahors affair".&lt;ref&gt;[http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2006/jun06/jun20news2 Jalabert caught up in "Cahors affair" trial]&lt;/ref&gt;  Several well-known professional cyclists were mentioned during the testimony of defendants.

==Climate==
The climate of Quintueles is oceanic, humid and generally temperate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Cuisine==
[[Fabes de la Granja|Spanish beans]] are produced in great quantities in Quintueles.  These Spanish beans, along with the local fish and shellfish, comprise the staple foods of the region. Popular dishes include Spanish beans with [[clam]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[goose barnacle]]s, [[Crangon crangon|brown shrimp]], [[velvet crab]]s, [[European spider crab]]s, [[conger|conger eels]], and [[Whiting (fish)|whiting]].&lt;!-- "barbaes" is listed as a food too.  This must be Asturian.  What is the English equivalent? I can't determine it. --&gt;  The local [[cider]] is also produced in abundance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Cultural heritage==
[[File:Playa La Ñora 2017.jpg|thumb|La Ñora beach.]]
[[Playa de La Ñora]], a local beach, is a major attraction in the area.  Quintueles' granaries, villages and farms produce the apples and [[Fabes de la Granja|Spanish beans]] that the community is known for.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Also worth mentioning are the local sandstone quarries. Folklore states that a fifteenth-century hermitage was situated among the quarries. Upon paying homage to the [[Virgin of the Snows]], the hermit was said to have received the protection of a large oak tree for his dwelling. The neighbourhood where this oak tree stood was named "Granderroble" in observance of the legend.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Directions to Quintueles==
Beginning from [[Gijón]], take the A-8 toward [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] and leave at junction 378 for Quintueles.  On entering the town, bear left at the intersection with the N-632.  After 200 metres, turn right onto highway VV-I in the direction of [[Playa de la Ñora]].  After two kilometres is Quintueles' school and church, which are an important part of the community.  Another option is to follow the N-632 road towards [[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]]. Shortly after passing the installation of [[Llorea]] is the council of Gijón. Continue past Villaviciosa to arrive in the town of Quintueles.  After three more kilometres the route reaches the bypass to Playa de la Ñora.  Quintueles is approximately 10 kilometres from Gijón.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Cuisine of the Lamp ([[Gastronómico de la Llámpara]]), is a festival organized by the Trumpet Society of Cultural Recreation ([[Sociedad Cultural Recreativa Clarín]]) of a neighbouring municipality, [[Quintes]]. The festival is hosted by the townsfolk of both Quintueles and Quintes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

== Location ==
Quintueles is situated on the [[flat coast]] of [[Spain|Spain's]] [[Cantabrian Sea]]. It is approximately 19 kilometres from [[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]] and 12 kilometres from [[Gijón]].  Quintueles is a coastal town with beautiful, tall cliffs that overlook the Cantabrian Sea.  Quintueles currently has a population of 663 people and there are about 460 dwellings.  The town has an area of 9,81 square kilometres; the sea marks its northern border, while [[Gijón]] lies to the west, [[Quintes]] to the east and [[San Miguel de Arroes]] to the south.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Quintueles has ten subdivisions:
* San Clemente
* Cerredo
* Capellanía
* Cazamular
* La Corolla
* El Peñucal
* Friuz
* Granderroble
* Rodavigo
* Los Pisones

==Local economy==
The Quintueles community has been dedicated to agriculture and stockbreeding for generations, but the modern trend is displaying growth in the service sector.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Many find the appeal of Quintueles to be its convenient location—it is near a large city, but the distance is great enough to maintain a pastoral atmosphere.  This theory, however, is simply speculation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Wildlife==
The landscape of Quintueles is dominated by cultivated fields and orchards in the plains zones.  Quintueles also has forests of [[eucalyptus]], with a few native [[laurels]], [[chestnut|chestnut trees]], [[oak]]s, and [[hazelnut|hazelnut trees]].   [[Fern]]s, [[furzes]], and [[Blackberry|brambles]] may also be found in thickets.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

This area is filled with animals typically found in coastal regions.  Marine birds, namely [[seagull]]s and [[hawk]]s, are common.  Migratory birds such as [[swallow]]s, [[thrushes]] and [[starling]]s are also present.  [[Weasel]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[boar]]s, and [[fox]]es are found in the forests.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

SIMI operated several terrorist training camps in the southern Indian state of [[Kerala]]. Due to [[votebank]] politics and pressure from human rights activists, the ruling [[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|LDF]] government failed to act against such terrorist groups. Emboldened by the passive attitude of the government and its failure to bring charges against the organisers of the Binanipuram camp, SIMI conducted more terror training camps in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/kerala-goes-soft-on-simi-country-pays/articleshow/3374387.cms |title=Kerala goes soft on Simi, country pays - The Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian Mujahideen]], a SIMI front, enjoys a certain degree of political patronage in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/what-a-terrorist-wants-bomb-blasts-and-kerala-holiday/20140328.htm |title=What a terrorist wants: Bomb blasts and Kerala holiday! - Rediff.com India News |publisher=Rediff.com |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Binanipuram camp ===

A camp was organised in 2006 at Binanipuram near [[Aluva]] in [[Ernakulam district]] of [[Kerala]] state. 40-50 SIMI members were trained in commando and jungle warfare skills.&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080825/main5.htm |title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Main News |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 2006, Kerala police questioned 18 people and arrested five — Ansar Moulavi, Shaduli, Nizamuddin, Abdul Rafeeq and Shamas — under the [[Unlawful Activities Prevention Act|Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]]. The five arrested were later released on bail.

Ansar Moulavi and Shaduli are also accused of attending another training camp at Vagamon conducted between December 2007 - January 2008. Both were arrested after the [[Jaipur bombings|13 May 2008 Jaipur bombings]] by the [[Rajasthan police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Mary |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1080817/jsp/nation/story_9702584.jsp |title=The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) &amp;#124; Nation &amp;#124; Kerala Kerala ‘slip’ under glare|publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=2008-08-17 |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vagamon camp ===

A camp was conducted at Thangalpara, [[Vagamon]] in [[Idukki district]] of Kerala in December 2007-January 2008. Camp attendees are said to be trained in commando, jungle warfare, trekking, rock climbing, [[Abseiling|rappeling]] and [[herbal medicine]]. Speeches inciting the participants to wage ''[[jihad]]'' (war) against India are said to made.&lt;ref name=da&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=182440 |title=Elusive Simi operative deported from Dubai |publisher=Daijiworld.com |date=2013-08-04 |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 20 students from [[Hubli]], [[Belgaum]] and [[Bangalore]] were trained to assemble explosives with easily available materials by a bomb expert [[Abdul Subhan Qureshi]]. [[Ammonium nitrate]], a commonly available nitrogenous fertiliser, was used in the [[2008 Ahmedabad bombings]]. Prototypes of liquid bombs using commonly available [[hydrogen peroxide]] were first experimented at the Vagamon camp.&lt;ref name=t /&gt;

Abdul Sathar alias Manzoor, from Aluva in Kerala, is accused of attending the camp and of being involved in the 2008 Ahmedabad bombings and [[2008 Bangalore serial blasts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Yasins-interrogation-may-throw-light-on-ISI-link-to-2008-serial-blasts/articleshow/22149206.cms |title=Yasin's interrogation may throw light on ISI link to 2008 serial blasts &amp;#124; Bengaluru News - Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also accused of recruitment of youths from Kerala and sending them to Pakistan for terror training by the [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SIMI-man-held-for-Kerala-terror-camp/articleshow/21586261.cms |title=SIMI man held for Kerala terror camp &amp;#124; India News - Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2013-08-04 |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declared a proclaimed offender, an Interpol red alert notice was issued against him. A fugitive for six years, he was deported from [[Dubai]] on 2 August 2013 and arrested on arrival in India.&lt;ref name=da /&gt;

===Kannur camp===

On 23 April 2013, a terror training camp inside a building owned by Thanal Foundation Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/21-pfi-activists-convicted-organising-terror-camp-kerala-38004 |title=21 PFI activists convicted for organising terror camp in Kerala |publisher=The News Minute |date=2016-01-22 |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Mayyil [[Narath]] area of [[Kannur district]] was organised by members of [[Popular Front of India]] (PFI), a SIMI front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pfi-is-simi-in-another-form-kerala-govt-tells-hc/979440/ |title=PFI is SIMI in another form, Kerala govt tells HC |publisher=Indian Express |date=2012-07-26 |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp was raided by police and 21 people were arrested. Country bombs, a sword, a human effigy, cellphones and accessories for making bombs were recovered during the police raid.&lt;ref name=daiji&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=377329 |title=Narath arms training case - 21 PFI activists awarded imprisonment |publisher=Daijiworld.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the charge sheet filed by the investigators, activists belonging to Popular Front of India and its political wing [[Social Democratic Party of India]] had organised this training camp. The charge sheet said that one of the participants had links with [[Indian Mujahideen]] terrorist group. The investigators provided evidence of transfer of funds between bank accounts to prove its allegations. The bank accounts details of Sanaulla Shabandri were found during the raid on the house of one of the accused. Shabandri from [[Bhatkal]], is believed to be a close associate of [[Yasin Bhatkal]] and an [[Indian Mujahideen]] member.&lt;ref name=daiji /&gt;

On 21 January 2016, a court sentenced 21 of those accused to varying years of imprisonments after they were found guilty under several charges including criminal conspiracy, membership of unlawful assembly, possession of arms and explosive substances, inciting communal disharmony, assertions prejudicial to national integration besides organising a terrorist camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=New Delhi, Mar 17, 2016, (PTI) 14:45 IST |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/535075/kannur-terror-camp-case-absconding.html |title=Kannur terror camp case: Absconding accused nabbed from Kerala |publisher=Deccanherald.com |date=2016-03-17 |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court found that the enterprise was unlawful and that the accused persons could not explain why they were in possession of weapons and country-bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/NIA-court-sends-21-to-jail-in-Narath-case/article14011919.ece |title=NIA court sends 21 to jail in Narath case |publisher=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarah Moore Grimké''' (November 26, 1792&amp;nbsp;– December 23, 1873) was an American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], writer, and member of the [[women's suffrage movement]]. Born and reared in South Carolina to a prominent, wealthy [[Planter (American South)|planter]] family, she moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in the 1820s where she became a [[Quaker]]. Her younger sister [[Angelina Grimké]] joined her there and they both became active in the abolition movement. The sisters began to speak on the abolitionist lecture circuit, among a tradition of women who had been speaking in public on political issues since colonial days, including [[Susanna Wright]], [[Hannah Griffitts]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Anna Dickinson]]. They recounted their knowledge of slavery firsthand, urged abolition, and also became lawyers for [[women's rights]].

==Early life==
Sarah Grimké &amp;ndash; her parents sometimes called her "Sally"&lt;ref name=Perryxi /&gt; &amp;ndash; was born in South Carolina, the sixth&lt;ref name=Perryxi&gt;Perry (2002), p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; of 14 children and the second daughter&lt;ref name=Perryxi /&gt; of Mary Smith and [[John Faucheraud Grimké]]. Their father was a rich [[Planter (American South)|planter]], and an attorney and judge in South Carolina.

Sarah's early experiences with education shaped her future as an abolitionist and [[feminist]]. Throughout her childhood, she was keenly aware of the inferiority of her own education when compared to her brothers' classical one. Although her family recognized her remarkable intelligence, she was prevented from obtaining a substantive education or pursuing her dream of becoming an attorney, as these goals were considered "unwomanly."&lt;ref name=lumpkin&gt;Lumpkin, Shirley. "American Women Prose Writers: 1820–1870" in Hudock, Amy E. and Rodier, Katharine. (eds.) ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'' v. 239. Detroit: Gale Group, 2001. From Literature Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated by private tutors on subjects considered appropriate for a young southern woman of her class,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Marion Ann and Heather E. Weir (2006). ''Let Her Speak for Herself: Nineteenth-Century Women Writing on Women in Genesis'', Baylor University Press, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; including French, painting with watercolors, playing the [[harpsichord]], and doing embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra F. VanBurkleo, and Mary Jo Miles. [http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00294.html Grimké, Sarah Moore], ''American National Biography Online,'' February 2000. Retrieved November 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father allowed Sarah to study geography, history and mathematics from the books in his library, and to read his law books; however, he drew the line at her learning Latin.&lt;ref name=Perry1&gt;Perry (2002), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah's mother Mary was a dedicated homemaker and an active member in the community. She was a leader in Charleston's Ladies Benevolent Society. Mary was also an active [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] and consequently often devoted herself to the poor and to women incarcerated in a nearby prison. Mary's beliefs were rigid; in addition, her many charitable activities kept her from developing affectionate relationships with her children.&lt;ref name=durso&gt;Durso (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling confined in her role, Sarah developed a connection to her family's slaves to an extent that unsettled her parents. From the time she was twelve years old, Sarah spent her Sunday afternoons teaching Bible classes to the young slaves on the plantation, an experience she found extremely frustrating. While she wanted desperately to teach them to read the scripture for themselves, and they had a longing for such learning, her parents prohibited this, as teaching slaves to read was illegal. Her parents also said that literacy would only make the slaves unhappy and rebellious, making them unfit for physical labor. Teaching slaves to read had been prohibited since 1740 in South Carolina.

Sarah secretly taught Hetty, her personal slave, to read and write, but when her parents discovered the young tutor at work, the vehemence of her father's response proved alarming. He was furious and nearly had the young slave girl whipped. Fear of causing trouble for the slaves themselves prevented Sarah from undertaking such a task again.  Years afterward, she reflected on the incident, writing "I took an almost malicious satisfaction in teaching my little waiting maid at night, when she was supposed to be occupied in combing and brushing my locks. The light was put out, the keyhole screened, and flat on our stomachs before the fire, with the spelling book under our eyes, we defied the laws of South Carolina."&lt;ref name=Perry2&gt;Perry (2002), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah's brother [[Thomas Smith Grimké|Thomas]] went to [[Yale Law School]] in 1805.&lt;ref name=Perry24&gt;Perry (2002), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; During his visits back home, Thomas continued teaching Sarah new ideas about the dangers of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the importance of religion. These ideas, combined with her secret studies of the law, gave her some of the basis for her later work as an activist.&lt;ref name=durso /&gt; Her father told her that if she had been a man, she would have been the greatest lawyer in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2002), p. 2. Lerner gives a somewhat different version, in which her father said "she would have made the greatest jurist in the country." Lerner (1998), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah believed her inability to get higher education was unfair. She wondered at the behavior of her family and neighbors, who encouraged slaves to be baptized and to attend worship services, but did not consider them true brothers and sisters in faith.

From her youth, Sarah believed that religion should take a more proactive role in improving the lives of those who suffered most.  Her religious quest took her first to [[Presbyterianism]]; she converted in 1817.&lt;ref name=Perryxi /&gt; After moving to Philadelphia in 1821, she joined the Quakers, whom she had learned about in an earlier visit with her father.&lt;ref name=Perryxi /&gt; There, she became an outspoken advocate for education and [[women's suffrage|suffrage]] for African Americans and women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Grimké, Sarah. Letter addressed to Mary S. Parker, President of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, in [http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/book-sum/grimke3.html ''Letters on the Equality of the Sexes''.] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090724001330/http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/book-sum/grimke3.html |date=2009-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1817, Sarah's father was seriously ill, and the doctors of Charleston recommended he travel to Philadelphia to consult [[Philip Syng Physick]]. Despite her vehement objections, her father insisted that Sarah, then 26 years old, accompany him as his nursemaid. Sarah relented, and they left Charleston for the north in May, 1819. When Physick found he could not help, he suggested that they take in the sea air of the fishing village of [[Long Branch, New Jersey]]. The pair settled into a boardinghouse, where, after just a few weeks, John Faucheraud Grimké died.&lt;ref name=Perry34etc&gt;Perry (2002), pp. 34–37, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ceplair (1989), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this experience, Sarah became more self-assured, independent, and morally responsible. She stayed in Philadelphia a few months after her father died and met Israel Morris, who would introduce her to Quakerism, specifically the writings of [[John Woolman]].&lt;ref name=lumpkin /&gt;&lt;ref name=lerner&gt;Lerner (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Charleston, but decided that she would go back to Philadelphia to become a Quaker minister and leave her Episcopalian upbringing behind. She was stymied, however, when she was repeatedly ignored and shut out by the male-dominated council.&lt;ref name=lumpkin /&gt; Becoming alienated, she later wrote, "I think no criminal under sentence of death can look more fearfully to the day of execution than I do towards our Yearly Meeting."&lt;ref name=Perry84&gt;Perry (2002), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

She returned to Charleston in the spring of 1827 to "save" her sister [[Angelina Grimké|Angelina]] from the limitations of the South. Angelina visited Sarah in Philadelphia from July to November of the same year and returned to Charleston committed to the Quaker faith. After leaving Charleston, Angelina and Sarah traveled around New England speaking on the abolitionist circuit, at first addressing women only in large parlors and small churches. Their speeches concerning abolition and [[women's rights]] reached thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritchie|first=Joy|title=Available Means|year=2001|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, 1829, Angelina joined her sister in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Ceplair (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; They had long had a close relationship; for years, Angelina called Sarah "mother", as Sarah was both her godmother and primary caretaker.&lt;ref name=lerner /&gt;

In 1868, Sarah discovered that her late brother had three illegitimate mixed-race sons by his personal slave. Welcoming them into the family, Sarah worked to provide funds to educate [[Archibald Grimké]] and [[Francis James Grimké]], who went on to successful careers and marriages, and were leaders in the African-American community.&lt;ref name=lumpkin /&gt; John, the youngest, was not interested in formal education and returned to the South to live.

==Activism==
{{see also|Grimké sisters}}

Sarah and Angelina had come to loathe slavery and all its degradations. They had hoped that their new faith would be more accepting of their abolitionist beliefs than their former had been. However, their initial attempts to attack slavery caused them difficulties in the Quaker community. The sisters persisted despite their belief that the fight for women's rights was as important as the fight to abolish slavery. Although Sarah had the desire to 'equip women for economic independence and for social usefulness' [22], they continued to be attacked, even by some abolitionists, who considered their position extreme. In 1836, Sarah published ''Epistle to the Clergy of the Southern States.'' In 1837, ''Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and the Condition of Women'' was published serially in a Massachusetts newspaper, ''The Spectator'', and immediately reprinted in ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', the newspaper published by radical abolitionist and women's rights leader [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. The letters were published in book form in 1838.

When the sisters were together in Philadelphia, they devoted themselves to charity work and to the Society of Friends (the proper name for the religion often called "Quaker"). Sarah began working toward becoming a clergy member but was continually discouraged by male members of the church. Sarah realized that, though the church was something she agreed with in theory, it was not delivering on its promises.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It was around this time that anti-slavery rhetoric began entering public discourse.

Joining her sister in the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] in 1836, Sarah originally felt that she had found the place where she truly belonged, in which her thoughts and ideas were encouraged. However, as she and Angelina began speaking not only on abolition, but also on the importance of women's rights, they began to face much criticism. Their public speeches were seen as unwomanly because they spoke to mixed-gender audiences, called "promiscuous audiences" at the time. They also publicly debated men who disagreed with them. This was too much for the general public of 1837 and caused many harsh attacks on their womanhood; one line of thought suggested that they were both just poor "spinsters" displaying themselves in order to find any man who would be willing to take one.&lt;ref name=lumpkin /&gt;

In 1838, Angelina married [[Theodore Dwight Weld|Theodore Weld]], a leading abolitionist who had been a severe critic of their inclusion of women's rights into the abolition movement. She retired to the background of the movement while being a wife and mother, though not immediately. Sarah completely ceased to speak publicly. Apparently Weld had recently written her a letter detailing her inadequacies in speaking. He tried to explain that he wrote this out of love for her, but said that she was damaging the cause, not helping it, unlike her sister. However, as Sarah received many requests to speak over the following years (as did Angelina), it is questionable whether her "inadequacies" were as bad as he described.&lt;ref name=lumpkin /&gt;

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Sarah wrote and lectured in support of President [[Abraham Lincoln]].

Sarah Moore Grimké was the author of the first developed public argument for women's equality. She worked to rid the United States of slavery, Christian churches which had become "unchristian," and prejudice against African Americans and women.&lt;ref name=lumpkin /&gt;

Her writings gave suffrage workers such as [[Lucy Stone]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Lucretia Mott]] several arguments and ideas that they would need to help end slavery and begin the women's suffrage movement.&lt;ref name=lumpkin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Million, Joelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ydeGAAAAMAAJ&amp;q ''Woman's Voice, Woman's Place: Lucy Stone and the Birth of the Women's Rights Movement.''] Praeger, 2003. {{ISBN|0-275-97877-X}}, pp. 36, 68, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Grimke is categorized as not only an abolitionist but also a feminist because she challenged the Society for Friends, which touted women's inclusion but denied her. It was through her abolitionist pursuits that she became more sensitive to the restrictions on women. She so opposed being subject to men that she refused to marry. Both Sarah and Angelina became very involved in the anti-slavery movement and published volumes of literature and letters on the topic. When they became well known, they began lecturing around the country on the issue. At the time women did not speak in public meetings, so Sarah was viewed as a leader in feminist issues. She openly challenged women's domestic roles.

She is remembered on the [[Boston Women's Heritage Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Downtown|url=http://bwht.org/downtown/#5|website=Boston Women's Heritage Trail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views on Faith and Creation ==
Sarah Grimke's view on abolition is clear based on her activism and she was a major female player in the abolition movement. These views were rooted in her Quaker faith and she believed, similar to her sister, that slavery was contrary to God's will. Similarly, her views on women's rights were rooted in the Bible. She had strong opinions especially on the story of creation. She believed Adam and Eve were created equally, unlike many who believed Eve was created as a gift for Adam. She also assigns much of the blame for the fall on Adam, who was tempted by an equal, instead of Eve, who was tempted by a supernatural evil, which is more forgivable given their innocence. This view was a main argument in her  "Letter 1: The Original Equality of Woman"&lt;ref&gt;Grimke, Sarah. "Letter 1: The Original Equality of Woman" (July 11, 1837). pp. 205–207&lt;/ref&gt; which is the foundation of her views of equality of the sexes, which is discussed in more detail in her "Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and the Condition of Woman".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sarah Grimke used Scripture in most of her writings that demonstrated her dedication to the Quaker faith and her genuine belief in it compatibility with activism. In 1837 Sarah responded to a ''Pastoral Letter'' that reinforced Biblical interpretations supporting the role of females in the [[Private sphere|"private sphere"]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;only'',''using Scripture to provide the benefits and power of this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963703406|title=Women's America : refocusing the past|last=editor.|first=Kerber, Linda K., editor. De Hart, Jane Sherron, editor. Dayton, Cornelia Hughes, editor. Wu, Judy Tzu-Chun,|isbn=9780199349364|oclc=963703406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah responded to this letter also with Scripture, encouraging women to take on a motto of " 'The Lord is my light, and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; whom shall I be afraid?' She must feel, if she feels rightly, that she is filling one of the most important duties laid upon her as an accountable being, and that her character, instead of being 'unnatural', is in exact accordance with the will of Him,".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://users.wfu.edu/zulick/340/grimkeletter.html|title=Sarah Grimke, Letter in Response to the Pastoral Letter|website=users.wfu.edu|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her faith and closeness to God were a critical factor in her ability to be unafraid during times of opposition and to argue on behalf of women and slaves well.

They are partly who migrated to [[India]] and their descendants and mostly refugees from Sri Lanka because of the recently concluded [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. There is also a small population of [[Sinhalese people]] in India, numbering about 3,500 and mostly located in [[Delhi]] and [[Chennai]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rop3=109305&amp;rog3=IN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joshuaproject.net/countries.php?rog3=IN&amp;sf=primarylanguagename&amp;so=asc&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early arrivals===
During 19th century and early 20th century some [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] especially from [[Jaffna]] migrated or settled in India for various reasons such as [[education]], employment in the British Indian government, business and other reasons.

===Sri Lankan refugees===
The Sri Lankan refugees arrived in [[Tamil Nadu]] in four waves. The first wave on 24 July 1983, after [[Black July]], to the 29 July 1987 up until the [[Indo-Sri Lanka Accord]], 134,053 Sri Lankan Tamils arrived in India. The first repatriation took place after the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord in 1987 and between 24 December 1987 and 31 August 1989, 25,585 refugees and non-camp Sri Lankan nationals returned to Sri Lanka. The second wave began with the start of [[Eelam War II]] after 25 August 1989, where 122,000 Sri Lankan Tamils came to Tamil Nadu. On 20 January 1992, after the assassination of [[Rajiv Gandhi]] 54,188 refugees were voluntarily repatriated to Sri Lanka, until March 1995. [[Eelam War III]] commenced in April 1995 starting the third wave or refugees. By 12 April 2002, nearly 23,356 refugees had come to Tamil Nadu. The flow of refugees had stopped in 2002 because of the cease fire agreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2009/11/focus-on-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vaeakau-Taumako''' (formerly known as ''Pileni'') is a [[Polynesian language]] spoken in some of the [[Reef Islands]] as well as in the [[Taumako]] Islands (also known as the [[Duff Islands]]) in the [[Temotu Province|Temotu]] province of the [[Solomon Islands]].

The language is spoken throughout the Taumako Islands, while in the Reef Islands, it is spoken on [[Aua, Reef Islands|Aua]], [[Matema]], [[Nifiloli]], [[Nupani]], [[Nukapu]], and [[Pileni]]. Speakers are thought{{by whom|date=July 2015}} to be descendants of people from Tuvalu.

The language has traditionally been considered one of the [[Futunic languages|Futunic]] group of Polynesian languages, but a 2008 study exclusively based on lexical evidence concluded that this membership is weakly supported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/research.php ''Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

Vaeakau-Taumako does not vary from the standard Polynesian and Austronesian vowel system, featuring five vowels that can be used either in a long or short form. Short vowels found in word-final syllables are frequently devoiced or dropped, but long vowels in the same position are always stressed. There is little allophonic variation between vowel pronunciations.&lt;ref group="GVT" name="p28"&gt;p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]

|-

| e: /e/ and /ē/
|
| o: /o/ and /ō/
|-
! [[Low vowel|Low]]
| 
| a: /a/ and /ā/
|
|}

Vowel sequences in Vaeakau-Taumako are typically not treated as [[diphthongs]], as they are not fully reduplicated, as shown in the word "holauhola". This is despite the vowels in the original word being pronounced like a diphthong.&lt;ref group="GVT" name="p28"/&gt;

===Consonants===

The Vaeakau-Taumako language has one of the most complex consonant system of the Polynesian languages, with 19 distinct phonemes, plus a large amount of variation across dialects. /b/ and /d/ are found primarily in loan words, rather being native to the language.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirated sounds are characteristic of the language, and are typically strong and audible. However, the use of aspirated sounds varies across dialects, enough that it is difficult to identify a consistent pattern aside from noting they always occur at the start of stressed syllables.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==

===Pronouns===

Vaeakau-Taumako pronouns distinguish between 1st, 2nd and 3rd person pronouns. There are some [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive distinctions]], and variations for singular, dual and plural in all cases. There are no gender distinctions. There is variation in the pronoun system for the dialects of Vaeakau-Taumako which can become quite complex, so for simplicity, only the general forms are recorded here.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

====Independent personal pronouns====

There are two distinctive base sets of independent personal pronouns in Vaeakau-Taumako. The standard forms are used for formal occasions and recorded text, while the colloquial forms are typically found in informal, everyday conversation.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

''hatou, hatu''
|}

====Bound subject pronouns====

The language also features bound subject pronouns which act as clitics to the tense-aspect-mood marker of the verb of the constituent. They are not obligatory to use. The presence of the "u" has free variation by the choice of the speaker, but they are typically less prevalent in the colloquial forms.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

====Hortative pronouns====

The dual, plural and 2nd person singular have specific pronouns used in imperative and [[hortative]] sentences.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

| ''ko''
| ''lu''
| ''tu''
|-
! 3rd person
| 
| ''la''
| ''latu, hatu''
|}

====Emphatic corefential pronouns====

When the subject and direct object of a sentence are the same thing, repetition of the independent pronoun in place of both argument positions is typically used. However, there is a set of emphatic coreferential pronouns used for the direct object to refer to someone or a group of people acting alone.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

| ''okhoe''
| ''okhoulua''
| ''okhoutou''
|-
! 3rd person
| ''okhoia''
| ''okhilaua''
| ''okilhatou''
|}

====The general pronoun ''nga''====

The word ''nga'' functions as a pronoun with specific use. It is a third person pronoun, but lacks specification for number, and is used to refer to both singular and plural referents. It typically is an anaphoric reference to a previously mentioned referent.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.106-107&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possession ==

=== Control ===
While it is common for Polynesian languages to distinguish between alienability and inalienability with [[Polynesian languages#a and o possession|a and o possessives]], this is not the case for Vaeakau-Taumako. This distinction exists, however it instead marks control – not of the possessed item itself, but of the possessive relationship.&lt;ref group="GVT" name="p109"&gt;p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A-possessives ====
Relationships that can be initiated or terminated freely, such as items that can be bought, sold or given away at will are marked with the a-possessive.&lt;ref group="GVT" name="p109" /&gt;

==== O-possessives ====
Relationships that are outside of the possessor's personal control, such as body parts and kinship relationships are marked with o-possessives.&lt;ref group="GVT" name="p109" /&gt;

=== Alienability and inalienability ===
Instead of a- and o- possessives, alienability and inalienability in Vaeakau-Taumako are distinguished by the use of either prenominal or postnominal possessive pronouns.&lt;ref group="GVT" name="p111"&gt;p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prenominal possessive pronouns ====
Prenominal possessive pronouns occur directly preceding the possessed nouns, and are typically used for inalienable relationships, such as kinship terms and body parts.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.112&lt;/ref&gt; Prenominal possessive pronouns distinguish between singular, dual and plural of the possessor. The singular possessive forms make an additional distinction between singular and plural of the possessed entity, and encode the a- or o-possessive directly. The dual and plural possessor forms are combined with the possessive prepositions ''a'' and ''o'' to express this distinction, or they may occur without a preposition.&lt;ref group="GVT" name="p111" /&gt;

|
|}

==== Postnominal possessive pronouns ====
The postnominal possessive pronoun succeeds the possessed noun, and are used to mark alienable relationships, such as owned items. They make no distinction between singular and plural of the possessed item, instead the distinction is usually made through the choice of article preceding the possessed noun. Like with prenominal possessive pronouns, the postnominal possessives are based on the possessive prepositions ''a'' and ''o'', plus a pronominal form indicating person and number of the possessor. In the singular form, this is the same set of suffixes found on the prenominal possessives,  whereas in the dual and plural form, a distinct set of person and number forms are found. In the third and first person, these forms are identical to the independent personal pronouns, except for the lack of aspiration on the initial consonant.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

=== Possessive Suffixes ===
The possessive suffixes ''-ku''  (1st person), ''-u'' (2nd person) and ''-na'' (3rd person) apply to a restricted set of kinship nouns: ''tama''/''mha'' ‘father’, ''hina'' ‘mother’, ''thoka'' ‘same-sex sibling’, ''thupu'' ‘grandparent’, and ''mokupu'' ‘grandchild’. These nouns cannot occur without possessive marking, they require either a possessive suffix or, in the dual and plural, a postnominal possessive pronoun.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.147&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative construction is for these nouns to take the 3rd person possessive suffix ''-na'' in combination with a prenominal possessive pronoun or possessive prepositional phrase. The form in ''-na'' must in such cases be understood as a neutral or unmarked form, since it may combine with a pronoun of any person and number; but a form in ''-na'' without any further possessive marking is unambiguously 3rd person.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.148&lt;/ref&gt; Nouns other than those previously mentioned do not take possessive suffixes, but instead combine with possessive pronouns.&lt;ref group="GVT"&gt;p.149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negation==

Vaeako-Taumako displays negation in prohibitions ([[prohibitive]], [[irrealis]], [[imperfective]], admonitive), statements (verbal and non verbal) polar questions and noun phrases. Negation morphemes behave similarly to verbs in many respects although they do not take tense-aspect-mood markers or form independent predicates.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011). A grammar of Vaeakau-Taumako. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton.p.397&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are instances of their taking complement clauses and for this reason negation morphemes might be considered a sub-class of verb.&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prohibition ===

Prohibitive clauses may be divided into two. Prohibitive ''auā'', (equal to the English 'don’t') and Admonitive ''na''. Prohibitives pattern themselves in similar ways and are most frequently positioned cause initially. Admonitives behave and distribute slightly differently as will be illustrated below.

Negated clauses appear with only a small range of tense-aspect-mood markers. Prohibitive clauses often display no tense-aspect-mood marker at all, if they do, the markers are either ''na'' [[irrealis]] or ''me'' prescriptive. Negated declarative clauses typically occur with either perfective ''ne'' or imperfective ''no'', with other options only marginally represented in  collected data.&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.386&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prohibitive ''auā'' ====

''auā'' appears clause-initially, however discourse particles such as ''nahilā'' (’take care, make sure’) may precede it. Other grammatical morphemes such as articles or markers of tense, aspect or mood may not precede it which excludes ''auā'' from the verb category of Vaeakao-Taumako.&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.386&lt;/ref&gt;

''Auā tau hano!''

‘Don’t go.’  &lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.386&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''auā'' behaves like a verb in that it may take clausal complements, which are then often either nominalised or the irrealis marker ''na'' is present (see table 1.1.3).&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.386&lt;/ref&gt;
A correlation exists between singular 2nd person subject and a nominalised clause although this correlation is not absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.387&lt;/ref&gt;

''Auā ko no hualonga!''

‘Don’t make noise!’ &lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.388&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting this, the 2nd person dual or plural subjects attract the irrealis marker ''na'' to create a prohibitive clause.

''Auā kholuna ō!''

‘Don’t you (two) go!’ &lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.388&lt;/ref&gt;

Within data sets of Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011), as implied by the imperative nature of the morpheme, ''auā''  will tend to appear with 2nd person subjects as above, although both 1st and 3rd subjects are also found.

''Auā''  is also found in conjunction with modifiers such as ''ala'' which marks a hypothetical or ''oki'', ‘back, again’. (&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.386&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Irrealis ''na'' and Imperfective ''no'' =====

Irrealis ''na'' and [[imperfective]] ''no'' adheres to a common pattern of appearing in 2nd person in dual or plural within prohibitive clause structure.

Instances of 3rd person are less frequent and tend to include the imperfective ''no'' in postposition to morpheme ''auā.''

‘Nothing shall be hidden from you.’&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.388&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Admonitive ''na'' =====

''na'' behaves similarly to ''aluā'' only in that it is clause initial, it is otherwise classified as a clause initial particle  and it must be accompanied by the tense-aspect-mood marker ''me''  which acts as a [[prescriptive]].&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.389&lt;/ref&gt;

‘Don’t kill the man!’&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.389&lt;/ref&gt;       						

However ''na'' also has a second function, it acts to point out the consequences of disobeying the order. In this role the ''na'' often appears without ''me'', creating a clause without tense-aspect-mood marking.&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.390&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statements ===

==== Verbal Clause Negation ====

Verbal negation is made up of three morphemes which act independently and may be understood as the English equivalents to ''siai'' ‘not’, ''sikiai'' ‘not yet’,and ''hiekh'' ‘not at all’.&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.390&lt;/ref&gt;

===== ''siai'' ‘not, no’ =====

According to Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) the colloquial pronunciation of  ''siai'' is ''hiai'', however the standard written form is ''siai''. 
''Siai'' comes after preverbal arguments but is placed before the tense-aspect-mood particle and following [[clitic]] pronoun.

‘She did not listen to her mother.’&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.391&lt;/ref&gt;					

As in the case of ''auā'' modifying particles, which are traditionally found after verbs,  may appear following ''siai''. An example of this is ''loa'' which is an emphatic marker.

For example, ''siai loa''.

'He refused to eat, and he didn’t wash his face either.’ &lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.392&lt;/ref&gt;

A further example is the addition of ''po'' which generally serves to connect a complement clause.

{| class="wikitable"

''Siai po ke ileila sika''.

‘She did not feel safe.’&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.393&lt;/ref&gt;

===== ''sikiai, hikiai'' ‘not yet’ =====

''sikiai, hikiai'' (where ''sikiai'' is the formal written expression of spoken ''hikiai'') appears in the same formation as above ''siai'' except it proceeds the preverbal argument and precedes any tense-aspect-mood markers. It appears less frequently and is often accompanied by the perfective marker ''ne''.&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.394&lt;/ref&gt;

===== ''hiekhī/hiekhiē'' ‘not at all’ =====

This is the emphatic form of the negator. It follows the same distribution as both ''sia'' and ''sikiai'' and is often accompanied by the post-nuclear modifier ''loa''.&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.395&lt;/ref&gt;

As with ''siai''  ''hiekhī'' appears in conjunction with complementiser ''po'', although with lower frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.395&lt;/ref&gt;

‘We had no idea where to draw water.’&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.395&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Non-verbal Clause Negation ====

The same negators are used as in the verbal clauses above.

2.1.4 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| a || Malani || na || siai || e || vai || ai
|-
|then || Malani || DEM.2|| NEG || SG.NSP || water || OBL.PRO

''A Malani na siai e vai ai.''

‘And Malani, there was no water there.’&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.396&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Questions ===

==== Polar Questions ====

Polar questions are commonly formed in three ways. A declarative clause with a rise in intonation to mark the interrogative which requires the binary, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response, much as they are in English may be used. The second alternative is  the addition of the verbal negator ''(o) siai'' ‘(or) not’  and the third is the addition of verbal negator ''sikiai'' (not yet) if the interrogative has a temporal element.&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.398&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple interrogative formed with declarative clause:

3.1
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| tha=ka|| ō || mua?
|-
| 1DU.INCL=FUT || go.PL || just
|}

''Thaka  ō mua?''

‘Shall we go?’&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.398&lt;/ref&gt;

3.1 a

''(o) siai''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| E || ai || mua || etai || ne || au || o || sai
|-
| GNR || exist || just || person || PFV || come || CONJ || NEG
|}

''E ai mua etai ne au o siai? (NUP)''

‘Has anyone come here?’ &lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.399&lt;/ref&gt;

3.1 b

''sikiai''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| a ||  hina-na ||  ko-i  || taku-a ||  ange ||  po ||  ke || hano || mua ||  oi || kute-a || mua || a || thaupē || po || ka || lanu||  o ||  sikiai

|}

''A hinana koi takuange po ke hano moa oi kutea moa a haupƝ po ko lanu e hikiai?''
     
‘His mother told him to go and see if the tide was rising yet.’&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.398&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Noun Phrase Negation ===

==== Negated Existence ====

Non-specific article ''e'' can be used to express 'negated existence' unless the noun has a possessive marker in which case ''e'' is absent.&lt;ref&gt;Næss, A., &amp; Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

3.1.1

'''Whirl-Mart''' is a [[culture jamming]] ritual aimed at retail [[superstore]]s and described by participants as "art and action".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXQMrC-U9pEC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22Whirl-Mart%22#PPA102,M1 Stewart, Kathleen. Ordinary Affects. Duke University Press, 2007]. {{ISBN|0-8223-4107-7}}. P.102&lt;/ref&gt;

An event consists of a group of supposed shoppers who congregate at a large superstore (usually a [[Wal-Mart]], [[Toys "R" Us]], [[Asda]], or [[J Sainsbury|Sainsbury's]]) and slowly push empty shopping carts silently through store aisles. Participants will not purchase anything and seek to form a lengthy chain of non-shoppers, continually weaving and "whirling" through a maze of store aisles for up to an hour at a time. Participants describe their actions as "a collective reclamation of space that is otherwise only used for buying and selling". Whirl-Marters seek to mimic and mock what they perceive as the absurdity of the [[shopping]] process.

==Origins==
The activity was founded by the group "Breathing Planet Troupe" at a Wal-Mart store in [[Troy, New York]], USA on April 1, 2001. The group was seeking to respond to an article from [[AdBusters]] magazine that called for foolish activities in conjunction with [[April Fool's Day]]. Since that time, Whirl-Mart activities have spread to many other communities around the world, including [[Texas]], [[Iowa]], [[Arizona]], and [[Pennsylvania]] in the USA, [[Canada]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. It is often "celebrated" at noon on the first Saturday or Sunday of the month. Whirl-Marters are often very loosely organized, describing themselves as open to anyone wishing to show up and participate.

In addition to being "just darned fun," the activity provides a legal outlet for would-be protesters to address "cathedral(s) of consumption" like Wal-Mart. Consequently, experienced Whirl-Marters (when confronted by security or store management) do not admit to being protestors and instead maintain that they are engaged in a peaceful "consumption awareness ritual." Whirl-Marters do not aim to block store aisles or interfere with legitimate shoppers, and typically will not speak unless addressed. Their aim is to create a non-disruptive, peaceful demonstration of how ridiculous they see Western [[consumerism]] to be. Participants are non-confrontational in seeking to make themselves silent examples rather than active propagandists. Some variations of the Whirl-Mart protest involve filling carts but then simply abandoning them or, when checking out, claiming to have forgotten the money to purchase the items in the overflowing cart, leaving said cart for the employees to clean up.

==Confrontations==
Participants claim they can generally talk their way out of being evicted from the store's corporate property (though the involvement of [[police|law enforcement]] officials in forcibly removing Whirl-Marters is not unheard of). When employees approach, Whirl-Mart participants generally scatter to various store aisles, forcing management or security to confront them individually. Participants will very rarely admit to or even address the topic of non-violent protest of [[commercialism]] or [[Economic materialism|materialism]], preferring to present themselves as would-be shoppers who are "still looking for something to buy" after spending up to an hour wandering aimlessly through a warehouse-sized superstore. Whirl-Marters often wear an identifying shirt or smock; in most jurisdictions it is not legally considered soliciting to wear a garment advertising a product, service, or cause.

Some participants have attempted to document their activities with cameras or video recorders. The film or tape from these are often seized by store authorities. A few websites have video documenting Whirl-Mart events; however, in general, superstores do not permit cameras or video recorders on their premises &amp;mdash; excluding security cameras used by the [[corporation]] itself.

'''Zaramo''' is a [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo language]], formerly primary language of the Zaramo people of eastern [[Tanzania]]. Zaramo is also known as Zalamo, Kizaramo, Dzalamo, Zaramu, Saramo and, Myagatwa. The language is critically endangered. The ethnic population of the Zaramo people reaches about 200,000, yet there are only a few elderly speakers remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/3145|title=Did you know Zaramo is critically endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These speakers are mostly located in the villages surrounding the city of Dar es Salaam. Zaramo is thought to be passed down matrilineally to the children in these villages, while it remains critically endangered in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.language-archives.org/language/zaj|title=OLAC resources in and about the Zaramo language|website=www.language-archives.org|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are very few translations of the language in existence except for a few native speakers' documented translations, and the publication of the New Testament from 1975. 

== Classification ==
Zaramo is genetically tied to the Niger-Congo language family. It is classified under the Atlantic-Congo, Volta-Congo, Benue-Congo, Bantoid, Southern, Narrow Bantu, Central, G, and Zigula-Zaramo families. (G.33)&lt;ref name="Zaramo"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/zaj|title=Zaramo|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Zaramo is the official language of a Bantu tribe located in the coastal area surrounding the former capital city of Tanzania, Dar es Salaam. Linguistic evidence supports the theory that Zaramo originated from the Luguru tribe. A migration of the Zaramo people eastward from their original location in Tanzania has been the source of slight changes in their cultural language.

The Zaramo as they are known today are made up of clans that migrated from the Kutu and the Luguru around 1700. Their common ancestry with the Luguru is substantiated, in that they have the same common language with only slight dialectal variations. The language of the Zaramo is mutually intelligible with those of the Jutu, the Luguru, the Kwere, and the Kami. Most Zaramo people of today chose to speak the lingua franca of Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/zaramo|title=Zaramo - Dictionary definition of Zaramo {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ethnic population of the Zaramo people reaches about 200,000, today there are only a few elderly speakers of Zaramo language. Most Zaramo people speak Swahili as their first language today and have adopted Swahili-Arabic names. They favor the Swahili over their endangered dialect for its broad use in communication and trade.

== Geographic Distribution ==

=== Official Status ===
Zaramo is not the official language of any country or region. Currently, the only locations where Zaramo still exists is Pwani region of eastern Tanzania. This area is located between too cities - Bagamoyo and Dar es Salaam. The rural, costal area is home to the Zaramo people who are the only ethnic group to speak the language.

=== Dialects Varieties ===
There are no known dialects of Zaramo. It shares a lexical similarity: 68% with Kutu&amp;nbsp;[kdc], 65% with Kami&amp;nbsp;[kcu], 61% with Kwere&amp;nbsp;[cwe]&amp;nbsp;and Doe&amp;nbsp;[doe].&lt;ref name="Zaramo"/&gt; This connection is substantiated by the historical relationship between the tribes.

== Examples ==
There are very few examples of Zaramo language available. A list of words and phrases was provided by a native speaker to the author of &lt;u&gt;Short Specimens of the Vocabularies of Three Unpublished African Languages: Gindo, Zaramo, and Angazidja.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kjtAAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=zaramo+laguage&amp;ots=gOU78Cnxip&amp;sig=F6boQ7d6KvRuOOKSzcj5VfzlwOE#v=onepage&amp;q=zaramo%20laguage&amp;f=false|title=Short Specimens of the Vocabularies of Three Unpublished African Languages: Gindo, Zaramo, and Angazidja|last=Steere|first=Edward|date=1859-01-01|publisher=C.

== Writing System ==
The Zaramo language uses latin script for its writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail&amp;key=Latn|title=ScriptSource - Latin|website=scriptsource.org|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin script is the most widely used writing system in the world. Some languages adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters such Zaramo, and other languages from the Niger-Congro orthographies.
