The '''Black Sea bumping incident''' of 12 February 1988 occurred when American [[cruiser]] {{USS|Yorktown|CG-48|6}} tried to exercise the right of [[innocent passage]] through Soviet [[territorial waters]] in the [[Black Sea]] during the [[Cold War]]. The cruiser was bumped by the Soviet [[frigate]] ''[[Ukrainian frigate Dnipropetrovsk|Bezzavetny]]'' with the intention of pushing ''Yorktown'' into [[international waters]]. This incident also involved the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Caron|DD-970|6}}, sailing in company with USS ''Yorktown'' and claiming the right of innocent passage, which was intentionally shouldered by a Soviet {{sclass2-|Mirka|frigate|1}} ''SKR-6''. ''Yorktown'' reported minor damage to its [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], with no holing or risk of flooding.&lt;ref name="Aceves"&gt;{{cite journal |author=William J. Aceves |title= Diplomacy at Sea: U.S. Freedom of Navigation Operations in the Black Sea|journal= International Law Studies|volume=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Caron'' was not damaged.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt;

At the time, the Soviet Union recognized the right of innocent passage for warships in its territorial waters solely in designated [[sea lane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kraska|Pedrozo|2013|pp=255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States believed that there was no legal basis for a coastal nation to limit warship transits to sea lanes only.&lt;ref name="=Kraska Pedrozo"&gt;{{harvnb|Kraska|Pedrozo|2013|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the [[U.S. Department of State]] found that the Russian-language text of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], Article 22, paragraph 1 allowed the coastal state to regulate the right of innocent passage whenever necessary, while the English-language text did not.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; Following the incident, the Soviet Union expressed a commitment to resolve the issue of innocent passage in Soviet territorial waters.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt;

== Background ==
In 1979, the United States launched an informal program to promote the "rights and [[freedom of navigation|freedoms of navigation]] and overflight guaranteed to all nations under [[international law]]."&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; The US government said that it initiated the program because some countries were beginning to assert jurisdictional boundaries beyond traditional claims.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; The United States wished to stop this and, it said, diplomatic protests had seemed to be ineffective.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; A new [[customary international law]] could emerge if nations avoided operating their ships and aircraft in the disputed areas, and the US saw this as undesirable.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt;

In the 1980s, US warships were passing through the straits from the [[Mediterranean]] into the Black Sea two or three times a year to "show the flag" and to claim the right of innocent passage in the coastal states.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; Aside from the right of free passage, US naval activity in the Black Sea served the purpose of upholding US rights under the 1936 [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits]]. According to a US government official, "the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosporus]] form an international waterway" under that convention and "if you don't periodically reaffirm your rights you find that they're hard to revive."&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt;

Meanwhile, "The Rules of Navigation and Sojourn of Foreign Warships in the Territorial Waters and Internal Waters and Ports of the USSR," enacted by the [[Soviet Council of Ministers]] in 1983, acknowledged the right of innocent passage of foreign warships only in restricted areas of the Soviet territorial waters in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Sea of Okhotsk]] and the [[Sea of Japan]];&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; no [[sea lanes]] for innocent passage in the Black Sea were designated.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; The Soviet vessels and aircraft were routinely dispatched to observe US warships there.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; In the 1980s, the Soviet Union viewed the US presence in the Black Sea as an attempt to undermine improving [[Soviet–American relations]].&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt;

After the [[1986 Black Sea incident|1986 incident]] in the Black Sea, involving USS ''Yorktown'' and USS ''Caron'', a meeting of the Soviet Defence Council was held later in the same year.&lt;ref name="RG"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.rg.ru/2014/04/10/korabli.html|script-title =ru:Атака "Беззаветного"|publisher =''[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]]''|author =Сергей Птичкин|language =Russian|date =10 April 2014|accessdate =8 September 2014|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140908203738/http://www.rg.ru/2014/04/10/korabli.html|archivedate =8 September 2014|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy [[Vladimir Chernavin]] offered to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], Defense Minister [[Sergey Sokolov (commander)|Sergey Sokolov]], Foreign Minister [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], and other senior officials that intruding foreign warships could be driven from Soviet waters by several means including bumping.&lt;ref name="RG"/&gt;

== Incident ==
On 12 February 1988, the {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}} USS ''Yorktown'', and the {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|1}} USS ''Caron'', conducted an [[innocent passage]] exercise in the Black Sea. ''Caron'' passed {{convert|7.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} off the Soviet shore, and ''Yorktown'' drew to {{convert|10.3|mi|km|abbr=on}} offshore. The commander of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] [[Mikhail Khronopulo]] received an order from Chernavin to curb the passage of US warships.&lt;ref name="RG"/&gt; Initially the destroyer ''[[Soviet destroyer Krasny Kavkaz|Krasnyy Kavkaz]]'' was tasked with confronting them, but she experienced technical problems so ''Bezzavetnyy'', a {{sclass2-|Krivak|frigate|1}}, was dispatched instead.&lt;ref name="KP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/25836.3/2809165/|script-title=ru:Империя наносит последний удар|publisher=''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]''|language=Russian|author=Алексей Овчинников|date=16 February 2012|accessdate=7 September 2014 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907174215/http://www.kp.ru/daily/25836.3/2809165/|archivedate=7 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to ''Bezzavetny''{{'}}s commander, Captain Vladimir Bogdashin, his ship had two [[cruise missile]]s instead of four, was half the size of ''Yorktown,'' and was only a third its size by [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]].&lt;ref name="KP"/&gt; The Soviet frigate ''SKR-6'', commanded by Captain Anatoliy Petrov, was approximately one quarter the size of USS ''Caron''.&lt;ref name="KP"/&gt;

First, ''Caron'' was approached by the frigate ''SKR-6'', and three minutes later, ''Yorktown'' was approached by the frigate ''Bezzavetnyy'',&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; while [[Tupolev Tu-16]] bombers monitored the vessels' movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://articles.philly.com/1988-02-13/news/26243991_1_soviet-ships-soviet-coast-soviet-protest| title =Soviet, U.S. Ships Bump In Black Sea| publisher =[[Philadelphia Media Network]]| author =Mark Thompson| date =13 February 1988| accessdate =6 September 2014| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140907172512/http://articles.philly.com/1988-02-13/news/26243991_1_soviet-ships-soviet-coast-soviet-protest| archivedate =7 September 2014| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the US warships clipped a corner of the Soviet territorial waters, they were bumped. At 10:02 a.m, local time, {{Coord|44|15.2|N|33|35.4|E|display=inline}}, {{convert|10.5|nmi|lk=in}} from the coast, ''SKR-6'' bumped the [[port side]] aft of ''Caron'' at frame about {{convert|60|ft|m}} from the bow.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; ''Caron'' received superficial scraping of paint, with no personnel injuries.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; ''Bezzavetnyy'', having bumped ''Yorktown'', was ordered{{by whom|date=February 2018}} to move away and not to contact her again.&lt;ref name="KP"/&gt;

Both US warships stayed on even course after the incident. ''Caron'' left Soviet territorial waters at 11:50 a.m. local time without further incident.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt;

Both US warships reported the incident to the commander in chief of United States naval forces in Europe. ''Caron'' reported that, at 13:20 local time, it was informed on channel 16 [[VHF]] by ''Bezzavetnyy'': "Soviet ships have orders to prevent violation of territorial waters, extreme measure is to strike your ship with one of ours."&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; The reply of ''Caron'' was "I am engaged in innocent passage consistent with international law."&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; ''Yorktown'', in its report stated that on 9:56, local time, it was contacted by ''Bezzavetnyy'' via channel 16 and told to leave Soviet territorial waters or "our ship is going to strike on yours."&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; Then, according to the report, ''Bezzavetnyy'' came alongside port side of ''Yorktown'' at 10:03 and bumped it by turning into the ship.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt;

The [[starboard]] anchor of ''Bezzavetnyy'' was torn away.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; Two [[Harpoon missile]] canisters on ''Yorktown'' sustained damage when ''Bezzavetnyy''{{'}}s bullnose passed down port quarter. ''Bezzavetnyy'' then cleared to port and took station {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} off the port beam of ''Yorktown''.&lt;ref name="Aceves"/&gt; ''Bezzavetnyy'' required a minor repair.&lt;ref name="KP"/&gt;

== Response ==
The [[Soviet Ministry of Defense]] issued a statement blaming the U.S. warships for ignoring the "warning signals of Soviet border guard ships" and for "dangerously maneuvering in Soviet waters".&lt;ref name="=Kraska Pedrozo"/&gt; The incident also drew a diplomatic protest from the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kraska|Pedrozo|2013|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These incidents were covered in the annual review of compliance with the US/Soviet Agreement On the Prevention of Incidents On and Over the High Seas signed on 25 May 1972.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

== Background of the verse ==
There are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent.&lt;ref name="arabic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamawakened.com/|title=Main Menu|website=Islam Awakened|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslims, such as [[Islamic feminism|Islamic feminist]] groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for [[Islam and domestic violence|domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="issue" /&gt;

In the Prophet's [[Farewell Sermon|farewell sermon]] as recorded in al-Tabari's History,&lt;ref&gt;al-Tabari, ''History of Al-Tabari, Vol. IX: The Last Years of the Prophet'' tr. Poonawala, I.K. (Albany, NY, 1990) pp. 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly in a ''hadith'' collected by Abu Dawud,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunnah.com/abudawud/11/185 sunnah.com] Sunan Abu Dawud 10:1900&lt;/ref&gt; he instructed husbands to beat their wives, but not severely (فَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ضَرْبًا غَيْرَ مُبَرِّحٍ ''fadribuhunna darban ghayra mubarrih''; literal translation: "beat them, a beating without severity") if their wives commit an immorality or adultery in the husband's absence; according to the cited farewell address sermon in al-Tabari's history, for a wife to allow someone a husband dislikes to "tread" on his bed means to commit sexual indecencies in the absence of the husband. This is obtained not only from the context of the sermon and the hadith cited, but also from the cited Cliff Note 772 in Vol. IX of Al-Tabari's history. Ibn 'Abbas, a companion of the Prophet, is recorded in the Tafsir of al-Tabari for verse 4:34 as saying that beating without severity is using a ''[[siwak]]'' (small tooth cleaning twig) or a similar object.&lt;ref&gt;Tafseer al-Tabari for 4:34 [http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;tSoraNo=4&amp;tAyahNo=34&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1 al-tafsir.com]&lt;/ref&gt; There are sources that say that [[Muhammad]] himself never hit a woman and forbade it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.systemoflife.com/dawah/character-of-prophet/330-ther-mercy-of-prophet-pbuh-on-women-|title=The Mercy of Prophet PBUH on Women|author=Created on Monday, 08 August 2011 22:48|date=2011-08-08|publisher=Systemoflife.com|accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hadith collected by Abu Dawud, Muhammad told men not to hit their wives on the face.&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2137 cited in Philips, A.A.B. &amp; Jones, J. ''Polygamy in Islam 2nd edition''. International Islamic Publish House (Riyad, 2005) p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hadith narration of the Farewell Sermon appears in Sunan Ibn Majah. The Arabic phrase mentioned above is here translated, "hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark."

{{Quote|'''It was narrated that:''' Sulaiman bin Amr bin Ahwas said: “My father told me that he was present at the Farewell Pilgrimage with the Messenger of Allah. He praised and glorified Allah, and reminded and exhorted (the people). Then he said: 'I enjoin good treatment of women, for they are prisoners with you, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit clear indecency. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark. If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding (furniture), nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses. And their right over you are that you should treat them kindly with regard to their clothing and food.' ”  '''Grade''': '''Sahih''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/urn/1319250|title=Hadith - The Chapters on Marriage - Sunan Ibn Majah - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|website=sunnah.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}{{Quote|text=`A’isha said: the Messenger of Allah (saws ) never struck a servant or a woman.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sunan Abu Dawood]]'', hadith 4786 / Book 43, Hadith 14 / Book 42, Hadith 4768&lt;/ref&gt;}}In his [[Arabic-English Lexicon|''Arabic-English Lexicon'']], [[Edward William Lane]] notes various definitions for the Arabic word "''Lahada''” such as "''Lahada'' means push, which appears in the first hadith and is rendered as "he struck" in the English translation by Abdul Hamid Siddiqui.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studyquran.org/LaneLexicon/Volume7/00000204.pdf|title=Lane's Lexicon, p.2676|last=|first=|date=|website=Study Quran|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these scholars highlight that the Qur'an can be interpreted differently as society changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Qur'an and Woman|last1=Wadud|first1=Amina|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Women's Rights in Islam|last1=Mernissi|first1=Fatimea|date=1991|publisher=Perseus Books|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|last1=Chaudhry|first1=Ayesha|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan A.C. Brown]] gives the wider scholarly tendency when it comes to the verse:

{{Quote|The vast majority of the ulama across the Sunni schools of law inherited the Prophet's unease over domestic violence and placed further restrictions on the evident meaning of the 'Wife Beating Verse'. A leading Meccan scholar from the second generation of Muslims, [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|Ata' bin Abi Rabah]], counseled a husband not to beat his wife even if she ignored him but rather to express his anger in some other way. [[Al-Darimi|Darimi]], a teacher of both [[Tirmidhi]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim bin Hajjaj]] as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad's disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women'. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet's example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating. Even [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Qur'an, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one's wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of 'strongly disliked' or 'disliked verging on prohibited'.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2014), pp. 275-276&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first part of the verse about men having authority over women is meant for obedience towards [[God in Islam|God]], not the husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_251_300/does_the_quran_allow_beating_of.htm|title=DOES THE QUR'AN ALLOW BEATING OF WOMEN?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.irfi.org|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background on the roles of men and women in Islam===
{{Main article|Gender roles in Islam|Women in Islam}}
The Qur'an states that men are the guardians of women, and thus responsible for earning livelihood for the family and female relatives. Women, however, are given a degree of autonomy over their own income and property, provided this autonomy is exercised in a way that is agreeable to the wishes of the husband, provided his wishes not be in violation of Islamic principles.&lt;ref name="hash"&gt;Iman Hashim, ''Reconciling Islam and feminism'', Gender &amp; Development, 1999, vol. 7, issue 1, p 7, {{ISSN|1355-2074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they are responsible for educating the children, as God has given the one preference over the other. Man is also considered to be the head of the family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amin Ahsan Islahi]], [[Tadabbur-i-Qur'an]], 2nd ed., vol. 2, (Lahore: Faran Foundation, 1986), p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an recommends that wives be obedient and adaptable to their husbands. Wives should also keep the secrets of their husbands and protect their honor and integrity. Islamic scholars consider this important in running a smooth family system.&lt;ref name="jsoc"&gt;[[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]], ''[[Mizan]]'', Chapter:The Social Law of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree (of advantage) over them. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise. (Qu'ran 2:228)&lt;ref name=versemen&gt;{{cite web|title=al-Baqarah 2:228|url=http://www.islamawakened.com/quran/2/228/default.htm|website=Islam Awakened|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For both men and women, ''zulm''- known in English as actions of 'cruelty' against someone- is explicitly prohibited.&lt;ref name=issue/&gt;

====Equality of genders throughout the Qur'an====
The equality of men and women is discussed in many places throughout the text. The Quran blamed Adam and Eve for the original sin as Satan talks to both of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~msaiupui/statuswomen.html|title=Status of Women in Islam|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iupui.edu|publisher=[[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922031909/http://www.iupui.edu/~msaiupui/statuswomen.html|archive-date=2018-09-22|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Then began Satan to whisper suggestions to them, bringing openly before their minds all their shame (Qur’an 7:20)&lt;ref name=verse1&gt;{{cite web|title=al-A' raf|url=http://islamawakened.com/quran/7/20/default.htm|website=Islam Awakened|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}
The Qur'an is also very specific that both men and women should receive equal punishment for wrongdoings (24:2), and that both men and women are seen as equals under God, and will be rewarded for their faith by entering Heaven (4:124).

{{Quote|text=The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes(Qur’an 24:2)&lt;ref name=verse2&gt;{{cite web|title=An-nur 24:2|url=http://islamawakened.com/quran/24/2/default.htm|website=Islam Awakened|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
{{Quote|text=Whoever does good deed,- male or female- and he is believer, he will enter Heaven, and not the least injustice will be done to him.

====Male and female relationships in the times of the Prophet====

In her book ''Qur'an and Women'', scholar [[Amina Wadud]] writes about the importance of women in the time of the Prophet.  During this time, women did not have access to the technology that women today have; giving birth and raising children was much more difficult due to diseases and lack of healthcare knowledge.  For this reason, Wadud writes, "The Qur'an establishes his [the husband's] responsibility as ''qiwamah'': seeing to it that the women is not burdened with additional responsibilities which jeopardize that primary demanding responsibility only she can fulfill." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wadud|first1=Amina|title=Qur'an and Woman|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need to reproduce and raise children contributed to the importance of gender roles in the time of the Prophet.

====Examples from the Prophet====
The late [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei|Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Hussein Tabataba'i]] (1903-1981 AD) provides the following exegesis on 4:34 from both [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'ite]] sources in his [[Mizan]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Ibn Abi Hatim has narrated through Ash’ath ibn ‘Abdil-Malik from [[al-Hasan]] that he said: “A woman came to the Prophet complaining against her husband that he had slapped her. The Messenger of Allah said: “Retribution”. Then Allah revealed the verse, “Men are maintainers of women… (4:34); so the woman returned without retribution [ad-Durr 'l-munthur, as-Suyuti]. [as-Suyuti] has narrated it from the Prophet through other chains too.  Some of them say that the Messenger of Allah said: “I wanted one thing (retribution), but Allah decided otherwise"...there were some instances where Allah had amended some prophetic orders by adding to or deleting from it, but it was only in his administrative order, not in matters of the law ordained by him for his people, otherwise it would have been an invalid nullification...the Messenger of Allah used to wonder aloud: "How can you embrace the woman with a hand you had hit her with?".  It is narrated also in [[al-Kafi]] through his chain from Abu Maryam from Abu Ja’far (Imam [[Muhammad al-Baqir]]) that he said: “The Messenger of Allah said: “What! Does one of you hit his wife, and then attempt to embrace her?".  Countless such statements are found in the traditions; and one may understand from them the Islamic views on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;Tafsir al-Mizan, by al-Allamah as-Sayyid Muhammad Husayn at-Tabataba-i, translated by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi. V. 8, p.217,220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Al-Tabari]] (839-923 AD) wrote that, "The Prophet never raised his hand against one of his wives, or against a slave, nor against any person at all." In fact, when the Prophet faced rebellion of his wives, rather than beat him, Al-Tabari accounts that he instead, "stayed away from his wives for 29 nights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mernissi|first1=Fatimea|title=The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Women's Rights in Islam|date=1991|publisher=Perseus Books|location=Cambridge|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates and discussion about the text==
In response to ''nushûz'', admonishment, leaving wives in their beds and ''idribihunna'' are permitted. Islamic scholars agree such actions can not be undertaken for any reason other than those mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] (see [[An-Nisa, 34#Interpretation of the word "nushûz"|''nushûz'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Saleem Shahzad, ''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novtitl2y1.html Can a Husband force his Wife to wear the Hijab?]'', [[Al-Mawrid|Renaissance - Monthly Islamic Journal]], 11(11), November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 1: Authority of men and its reasons===
This allots men authority over women due to following reasons:
1: Because God has given some more strength than others.
2: Because men spent from their property to support women i.e., 
clothing, residence, and sustenance.The word ''qawwamun''  is also used at Al-Quran 4:134. Here it is said that believers should be Qawwamun with fairness.

====1: God has favoured some over others====
One of the reason men being ''qawwamun'' over women is that God has favoured some over others.{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}

====2: Men are responsible of maintenance of women====
Second reason of men being ''qawwamun'' over women is that because men are responsible of earning for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://insideislam.wisc.edu/2010/09/controlling-women-is-not-part-of-islam/|title=Controlling women is not part of Islam|last=|first=|date=2010-09-22|work=Inside Islam|access-date=2018-09-22|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 2: Characters of pious women===
The verse declares that pious women are:
1: Obedient
2: Guarding the unseen as God prescribes.{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}

====1: Obedient or ''Qanitat''====
The verse commands women to be ''qanitat''. The term has been used in {{Cite Quran|33|35|s=ns}} to refer to men and women alike, who are obedient to God. Some commentators use the term to mean obedience to the husband, while others assert that it means obedience to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wadud|first1=Amina|title=Qur'an and Women|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some "scholars" agree that the husband does not have absolute control over his wife, and her first loyalty is to God.&lt;ref name = Kecia&gt;{{Cite book

====2: Guarding the unseen====
''Hafizat'' is derived from ''hafaz'' meaning to guard. The subjective form is ''hafiz'' meaning a person who guards and ''hafizah'' meaning she who guards (feminine). ''Hafizat'' is plural of ''hafizah'' (both being feminine).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} It means that good women guard themselves in the absence of Husband as God prescribes.{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}

===Part 3: Rebellious women and advice===
And those whose rebellion (''nushûz'') is feared. It is advised
1: to admonish them
2: to leave them alone in beds
3: to beat them

* the term "''nushûz''" (نُشُوز) is translated as "disloyalty and ill-conduct" by Yusuf Ali, "rebellion" by [[Marmaduke Pickthall|Pickthall]] and "desertion" by [[M. H. Shakir|Shakir]]. Other scholars{{Who|date=September 2018}} have drawn on hadiths{{Which|date=September 2018}} to interpret the meaning of the word.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====1: to admonish them ====
The first response to ''nushuz'' is ''wā'z'' (‘وَعَظ’), meaning to first admonish or scold the wife of her behaviour.&lt;ref name="jsoc"/&gt; There is strong agreement amongst Muslim scholars that this admonishment must be conducted in a spirit of reconciliation.&lt;ref name="Ammar" /&gt;

====2: to leave them alone in beds ====

According to tafsir ibn kathir, a well known commentary of Quran. He describes in his exegesis.

{{quote|The Sunan and Musnad compilers recorded that Mu`awiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri said, "O Allah's Messenger! What is the right that the wife of one of us has on him'' The Prophet saido feed her when you eat, cloth her when you buy clothes for yourself, refrain from striking her face or cursing her, and to not abandon her, except in the house.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=672&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Should the ''nushuz'' continue, the next step is to refuse to share the bed with the wife. Again Muslim scholars emphasize on the spirit of healing while conducting this action.&lt;ref name="Ammar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ammar|first=Nawal H.|date=May 2007|title=Wife Battery in Islam: A Comprehensive Understanding of Interpretations|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801207300658|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=13|issue=5|pages=519–523|doi=10.1177/1077801207300658|pmid=17478676|via=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====3:  to beat them (''iḍribūhunna'' and ''daraba'')====
According to tafsir ibn Kathir.

{{quote|Muslim recorded that Jabir said that during the Farewell Hajj, the Prophet said;
(Fear Allah regarding women, for they are your assistants. You have the right on them that they do not allow any person whom you dislike to step on your mat. However, if they do that, you are allowed to discipline them lightly. They have a right on you that you provide them with their provision and clothes, in a reasonable manner.) Ibn `Abbas and several others said that the Ayah refers to a beating that is not violent. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that it means, a beating that is not severe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=672&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term ''iḍribūhunna'' (usually translated, 'beat them') in 4:34 comes from the root ''ḍaraba'' (Arabic: ضرب).&lt;ref&gt;ضرب defined in Lane, E.W. (1863-93) ''An Arabic English Lexicon'' Reprinted in Beirut: Librarie du Liban, 1968, p.1777 [http://www.studyquran.org/LaneLexicon/Volume5/00000062.pdf View on studyquran.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The word has been used many times in the Quran to mean: to hit, to travel the earth, to set up, to condemn and to give examples. Thus scholars interpret ''iḍribūhunna'' in different ways. Whereas many interpret it to mean "to strike", others hold that the term means "to separate".&lt;ref name="Ammar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-29/koran-434-islam-domestic-violence/10112916|title='A licence to treat his wife badly': Why women fear Koran 4.34|date=2018-08-29|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an action is to be administered only if neither the husband nor the wife are willing to divorce.&lt;ref name="shaf" /&gt; In the context of this verse, iḍribūhunna has also been interpreted to mean "go to bed with them",&lt;ref&gt;Al-Qur'an: a Contemporary Translation by Ahmed Ali, Princeton University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; the Arabic root word "''daraba''" being taken from the prosaic example "the stud-camel covered the she-camel".&lt;ref&gt;Raghib, ''Al-Mufridat fi Gharib Al-Qur'an''&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''daraba'' is translated by Yusuf Ali as "beat," but the Arabic word is used elsewhere in the Qur'an to convey different meanings. The phrase, "''Daraba Allah mathalan''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|11|24|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; translates to, "Allah ''gives'' or ''sets'' an example."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/252662926|title=Qur'an and Woman: Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman's Perspective|last=Amina|first=Wadud|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780198029434|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=76|oclc=252662926}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this word might be compared to the way "to strike" is used in English, which can mean, "to strike a pose," or "to strike a bargain," not just referring to the physical act of hitting something. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/873805718|title=Domestic violence and the Islamic tradition : ethics, law and the Muslim discourse on gender|last=Chaudhry|first=Ayesha|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=|isbn=9780191669897|edition=1st|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=13|oclc=873805718}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''daraba'' is also intentional, because a different Arabic word exists, "''daraba''" which is translated to, "to strike repeatedly or intensely."&lt;ref name="Darraba"&gt;{{cite book|title=Qur'an and Woman|last1=Wadud|first1=Amina|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown]] resumes the situation:&lt;blockquote&gt;If a wife exhibited egregious disobedience (nushuz) such as uncharacteristically insulting behavior, leaving the house against the husband's will and without a valid excuse or denying her husband sex (without medical grounds), the husband should first admonish her to be conscious of God and proper etiquette. If she did not desist from her behavior, he should cease sleeping with her in their bed. If she still continued in her nushuz, he should then strike her to teach her the error of her ways. Shaffii law only allowed the husband to use his hand or a wound-up handkerchief (mina malfuf), not a whip or stick. All schools of law prohibited striking the wife in the face or in any sensitive area likely to cause injury. All except some Maliki jurists held that the wife could claim compensation payment (diya) from the husband for any injury she sustained, and Hanbalis, the later Shaffii school as well as the Maliki school, allowed a judge to dissolve the marriage at no cost to the wife if harm had been done. In effect,  any  physical harm was grounds for compensation and divorce since the Prophet had limited striking one's wife to 'a light blow that leaves no mark.' Causing any injury thus meant that a husband had exceeded his rights. All schools of law agreed that if the wife died due to a beating, her family could claim her wergild or possibly even have the husband executed.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2014), pp. 276-277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Many jurists interpret ''iḍribūhunna'' as "more or less symbolic."&lt;ref name="asad"&gt;[[Muhammad Asad]], ''The Message of the Qur'an'' (his translation of the Qur'an).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One such authority is the earliest [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|hafiz]], [[Ibn Abbas]].[http://www.themodernreligion.com/women/w_abuse_badawi.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Others,{{Who|date=September 2018}} however, argue that a mere symbolic administration would be pointless and rather should be an "energetic demonstration" of the love of the husband. But it is agreed that the demonstration should not seriously hurt the wife.&lt;ref name="shaf" /&gt;

The 2007 translation ''[[The Sublime Quran]]'' by Laleh Bakhtiar translates ''iḍribūhunna'' not as 'beat them' but as 'go away from them'. The introduction to her translation discusses the linguistic and shari‘ah reasons in Arabic for understanding this verb in context. The Prophet never beat his wives, and his example from the [[Sunnah]] informs the interpretation of this verse. This interpretation is supported by the fact that some other verses, such as 4:101 which contains word ''darabtum'' (derivation from ''daraba''), demonstrate also the interpretation of Arabic word ''daraba'' to have meaning 'going' or 'moving'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Islamic scholar Tahir-ul-Qadri has given the same translation in his translation of the Quran "''Irfan-ul-Quran''": "(...)and (if they still do not improve) turn away from them, striking a temporary parting.(...)".&lt;ref name="irfan-ul-quran.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Minhaj Internet Bureau |url=http://www.irfan-ul-quran.com/quran/english/contents/sura/cols/0/ar/1/ur/1/ra/1/en/1/sid/4/ |title=an-Nisā’ (Women) |publisher=Irfan-ul-Quran |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translation is further supported by the fact that the word "''darabtum''" is used in the same chapter (specifically, in {{Cite Quran|4|94|s=ns}}), which means to "go abroad" in the sake of Allah and which is derived from the same root word ("''daraba''") as "''idribuhunna''" in 4:34.&lt;ref name="4:94"&gt;Osama Abdallah. [http://www.islamawareness.net/Wife/beating1.html ''Systematic comparison with 4:94''] Islamawareness.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Woman in the Shade of Islam'' by Saudi scholar Abdul Rahman al-Sheha stated that a man may "beat" his wife only if it occurs without "hurting, breaking a bone, leaving blue or black marks on the body and avoiding hitting the face, at any cost."

A widely used 1930 English translation of the Quran by British Muslim scholar Marmaduke Pickthall determined the verse to mean that, as a last resort, men can "scourge" their wives.&lt;ref name=issue/&gt;

Some jurists argue that even when hitting is acceptable under the Qur'an, it is still discountenanced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] comments that "Whenever the Prophet (peace be on him) permitted a man to administer corporal punishment to his wife, he did so with reluctance, and continued to express his distaste for it. And even in cases where it is necessary, the Prophet (peace be on him) directed men not to hit across the face, nor to beat severely nor to use anything that might leave marks on the body." "Towards Understanding the Qur'an" Translation by Zafar I. Ansari from "Tafheem Al-Qur'an" (specifically, commentary on 4:34) by Syed Abul-A'ala Mawdudi, Islamic Foundation, Leicester, England.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The medieval jurist ash-[[Shafi'i]], founder of one of the main schools of ''[[fiqh]]'', commented on this verse that "hitting is permitted, but not hitting is preferable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[S]ome of the greatest Muslim scholars (e.g., Ash-Shafi'i) are of the opinion that it is just barely permissible, and should preferably be avoided: and they justify this opinion by the Prophet's personal feelings with regard to this problem." [[Muhammad Asad]], ''The Message of the Qur'an'' (his translation of the Qur'an).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam|No god but God]]'', [[University of Southern California]] scholar [[Reza Aslan]], stated that false interpretations of the text have occurred because Quranic commentary "has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men."&lt;ref name=issue/&gt;

The Islamic prophet Mohammed himself, according to Islamic tradition, never once struck a woman in argument. This fact is sometimes cited in debates about the text.&lt;ref name="issue"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261.html|title=Clothes Aren't the Issue|last=Nomani|first=Asra Q.|date=October 22, 2006|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922033032/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261_2.html?noredirect=on|archive-date=2018-09-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6582">{{For|other uses, including other legal terms|Barratry (disambiguation){{!}}Barratry}}

'''Barratry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ær|ə|t|r|i}} {{Respell|BARR|ə|tree}}) is a legal term with several meanings. In [[common law]], barratry is the offense committed by people who are "overly officious in instigating or encouraging prosecution of groundless litigation" or who bring "repeated or persistent acts of litigation" for the purposes of profit or harassment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/barratry Barratry at freedictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although it remains a crime in some jurisdictions, barratry has frequently been abolished as being anachronistic and obsolete. 

If barratrous litigation is deemed to be for the purpose of silencing critics, it is known as a [[strategic lawsuit against public participation]] (SLAPP). Jurisdictions that otherwise have no barratry laws may have SLAPP laws.

In [[admiralty law]], [[Barratry (admiralty law)|barratry]]  is misconduct by the master or crew of a vessel against the [[shipowner]] (or [[demise charter]]er), such misconduct damaging the ship or its cargo.
== Barratry by country ==

===Australia===
In Australia, the term barratry is predominantly used in the first sense of a frivolous or harassing litigant. The concept has fallen into disuse in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lrc.nsf/pages/DP36CHP2 Discussion Paper 36 (1994) - Barratry, Maintenance and Champerty]. Law Reform Commission, New South Wales. Accessed August 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New South Wales ====
The offence of being a common barrator was abolished in New South Wales by Section 4A of the Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act 1993.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, barratry, alongside all [[Common law offence|common law offences]] except [[contempt of court]], were abolished by the 1953 consolidation of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].

=== United Kingdom ===

====England and Wales====
In [[England and Wales]] the [[common law offence]] of '''being a common barrator''' was abolished by section 13(1)(a) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].

===== History =====

Being a common barrator was an offence under the [[common law]] of England. It was classified as a [[misdemeanor]]&lt;!--Note that "misdemeanor" is a correct spelling in British English usage for the legal term of art--&gt;. It consisted of "persistently stirring up quarrels in the Courts or out of them". It is uncertain whether, in the ordinary way, persons charged with commission of the offence were dealt with by [[indictment]].&lt;ref name="bailii.org"&gt;[[Law Commission (England and Wales)|The Law Commission]], [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1966/3.html Proposals to Abolish Certain Ancient Criminal Offences] (Law Com 3), paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] recommended for the offence to be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Law Commission (England and Wales)|The Law Commission]], [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1966/3.html Proposals to Abolish Certain Ancient Criminal Offences] (Law Com 3), paragraphs 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; It said that there had been no indictments for this offence for "many years" and that, as an indictable misdemeanor, it was "wholly obsolete".&lt;ref name="bailii.org"/&gt; Its recommendation was implemented by the Criminal Law Act 1967.

==== Scotland ====
In Scots law, barratry referred to the crime committed by a judge who is induced by bribery to pronounce judgment.

===United States===
Several jurisdictions in the United States have declared barratry (in the sense of a frivolous or harassing litigant) to be a [[crime]] as part of their [[tort reform]] efforts. For example, in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[California]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], barratry is a [[misdemeanor]].&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Sanford'', 202 Cal. App. 3d Supp. 1 (1988); 18 Pa.C.S. 5109.  [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA3/202CA3dS1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Okla. Stat. tit. 21 § 550-551.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Texas]], barratry is a misdemeanor on the first conviction, but a [[felony]] on subsequent convictions.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Penal Code section 38.12&lt;/ref&gt;

* California Penal Code Section 158: "Common barratry is the practice of exciting groundless judicial proceedings, and is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six months and by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000)."
* California Penal Code Section 159: "No person can be convicted of common barratry except upon proof that he has excited suits or proceedings at law in at least three instances, and with a corrupt or malicious intent to vex and annoy."
* Revised Code of Washington 9.12.010: "Every person who brings on his or her own behalf, or instigates, incites, or encourages another to bring, any false suit at law or in equity in any court of this state, with intent thereby to distress or harass a defendant in the suit, or who serves or sends any paper or document purporting to be or resembling a judicial process, that is not in fact a judicial process, is guilty of a misdemeanor; and in case the person offending is an attorney, he or she may, in addition thereto be [[disbarment|disbarred]] from practicing law within this state."&lt;ref name="rcw"&gt;[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.12.010 RCW 9.12.010 Barratry], Revised Code of Washington. Accessed 2012-3-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Virginia laws on barratry, champerty, and maintenance were overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States in [[NAACP v. Button]] 371 U.S. 415 (1963).

==Other==

In his ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', Canto XXI, [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] places barrators in the Eighth Circle, fifth bolgia of [[Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 9 Circles of Hell (Dante's Inferno) - History Lists|url = http://historylists.org/art/9-circles-of-hell-dantes-inferno.html|website = historylists.org|accessdate = 2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blitz Wolf''''' is a 1942 anti-German [[World War II]] [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]-parodying cartoon produced and distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It was directed by [[Tex Avery]] and produced by [[Fred Quimby]]. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons]] but lost to another anti-German World War II parody ''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'', a [[Donald Duck]] cartoon.&lt;ref name="Shull2"&gt;Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 113-114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The plot is a parody of the [[Three Little Pigs]], told from a [[World War II|Second World War]] [[anti-German propaganda]] perspective. In this cartoon, the pigs go to war against Adolf Wolf ([[Adolf Hitler]]), who is set on invading their country, Pigmania. The two pigs who built their houses of straw and sticks claim they don't have to take precautions against the wolf, because they signed [[non-aggression pact]]s with him. The pig who built his house of stone, "Sergeant Pork" (an homage to [[Sergeant York (film)|Sergeant York]]), does take his precautions and outfits his house with defense machinery.

Adolf Wolf invades Pigmania, despite the two pigs protesting that he signed a treaty with them. He destroys their houses, forcing the pigs to hide in the third pig's house, prompting a battle between the two parties. Towards the end of the cartoon, Adolf Wolf is blown out of his bomber plane by the pigs' artillery shells filled with [[war bond|Defense bonds]] and falls down to Earth alongside a bomb, which promptly blows him to [[Hell]] upon impact. There he realizes he is dead and says: ''"Where am I? Have I been blown to... ?",'' whereupon a group of devils adds: ''"Ehhhh, it's a possibility!''", in reference to a then well-known [[catchphrase]] by [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]].

==Cultural references==
*This is Tex Avery's first cartoon at MGM, and also the first film at MGM for animator [[Ed Love]] (Love had arrived at MGM with [[Kenneth Muse]] just after the 1941 Disney animators' strike).
*The [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|MGM lion]], Tanner, roars to the tune of "[[Hold That Tiger]]".
*Adolf Wolf, the antagonist of the cartoon, would serve as inspiration for Tex Avery's unnamed wolf, who would appear in other cartoons such as Red Hot Riding Hood and Northwest Hounded Police.
*Tex Avery would once again parody the story of the Three Little Pigs in "One Ham's Family" and "The Three Little Pups".
*This short was widely available, uncut, on the [[MGM/UA Home Video|MGM/UA video]] label's [[VHS]] release, ''Tex Avery's Screwball Classics, Vol. 4'' and on the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] laserdisc collection ''The Complete Tex Avery''. A fully restored and uncut version is available on [[Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection|Academy Awards Animation Collection]] DVD set by [[Warner Home Video]], and as a bonus feature (in standard definition) on Disc 3 of the ''[[Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 2]]'' Blu-ray set.
*There is a reference to the [[Doolittle Raid]] on Tokyo (when the bomb lands and destroys Tokyo, there is a sign "Doolittle Dood It!" coming out from the water).
*[[Pinto Colvig]] provides the voice of "Practical Pig", as he did in Disney's ''[[Three Little Pigs (film)|Three Little Pigs]]''.
*Adolf Wolf's voice was provided by [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]], who would later voice [[Droopy]], who starred in his own adaptation of the story called ''The Three Little Pups''.
*In the beginning, the two little pigs mockingly sing to Sergeant Pork: ''[[You're in the Army Now (song)|You're in the Army Now]],''/ ''You're Not Behind the Plow,''/ ''You're Diggin' a Ditch,''/ '''''[pause and motion freeze],'''''/ ''You're in the Army Now!'' The pause was inserted to replace the line "You Son of a Bitch", which would be inappropriate for a film at the time. This is much similar to a gag in the [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon ''[[The Draft Horse]]''.
*Most of the scenery doesn't resemble World War II at all. The [[trenches]] resemble [[World War I]].
*As the tanks arrive, one small tank has the line "[[Good Humor]]" written on its side and makes the sound of an ice cream truck. This is similar to a joke later used in ''[[Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips]].''
*A lone [[flame tank]] not spewing fire holds up a sign with the line ''''I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire.''''
*When the straw house is blown away, a sign says ''''Gone with the Wind'''', referring to the [[Gone with the Wind (film)|1939 film]] (with another smaller sign agreeing that this is a corny gag).
*At one point, Sgt. Pork distracts incoming shellfire by holding up a copy of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine's (unseen-by-the-audience) Petty Girl [[pin-up]] artwork by [[George Petty]].

==Analysis==
Out of 15 cartoon shorts released by the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio]] in 1942, this was the only one to have World War II as its subject matter. Besides targeting Adolf Hitler, the short includes references to [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States]].&lt;ref name="Shull"&gt;Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 52-54&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wolf holds a sign inviting the audience to hiss at him, as nobody cares about their reaction. This breaks the [[fourth wall]] and reveals the character's contempt for the audience.&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt;

There is a mixed message regarding the characters. The Wolf is a [[Psychopathy#Etymology|sociopath]] with enough [[panache]] to keep the audience interested in him. Conversely, [[Sergeant]] Pork is a humorless, stoic character who fails to stand out.&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt;

The MGM pressbook termed the short as pro-democracy [[propaganda]]. The two lazy pig brothers reject preparation for defense because of their [[non-aggression pact]], an allusion to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. Their brother Sgt. Pork is named after Sgt. [[Alvin C. York]], a World War I hero who inspired the film ''[[Sergeant York (film)|Sergeant York]]'' (1941). He represents the attitude of preparing for war.&lt;ref name="Shull2"/&gt;

The Wolf violates a [[non-aggression pact]] to blow down the pigs' homes. The two lazy pigs become [[fugitive]]s of war and seek asylum in their brother's [[Fortification|fortified]] home. Said home demonstrates a sign: "No Japs allowed". The three pigs use a huge cannon to bomb [[Tokyo]]. The city is destroyed with the image of the [[Rising Sun Flag]] collapsing in the background.&lt;ref name="Shull2"/&gt;

During the showdown, the Wolf fires an artillery shell against the fortified house. Sgt. Pork in his trench reaches down for his copy of the ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine. The pig opens the magazine and shows the centerfold to the shell. The shell stops in midflight and whistles in appreciation. It then retreats and returns with ten other shells. This group of friends are fascinated by the image presented to them. They make catcall sounds and then fall down de-activated.&lt;ref name="Kakoudaki"&gt;Kakoudaki (2004), p. 339-341&lt;/ref&gt; The pinup here is used as more than a talisman for boosting morale. It exploits the male vulnerability of the enemy through eliciting erotic arousal. The shells stand-in for their human operators.&lt;ref name="Kakoudaki"/&gt;

In another scene where a weapon stands-in for military personnel, Pork's cannon collapses exhausted. Its owner revives it through feeding it B-1 vitamins.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f8STwtqdeg#t=7m5s&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Thiamin|B1]] helps the body generate energy.) The cannon stands erect again, a phallic image, and begins blasting away all on its own. The label may reference the number system of military hardware like the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]].&lt;ref name="Kakoudaki"/&gt;

The Wolf utilizes a "Stinka Bomber PU". This is a parody of the German [[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka]], a [[dive bomber]] used by the [[Luftwaffe]].&lt;ref name="Shull2"/&gt; The shells that down the aircraft are filled with [[War bond|defense bonds]]. The cartoon concludes with two printed titles: "The end of Adolf" and "If you'll Buy a Stamp or Bond- We'll Skin that Skunk Across the Pond!"&lt;ref name="Shull2"/&gt;

According to [[Chuck Jones]], Tex Avery was criticized by an MGM producer for being overly rough in his depiction of Hitler. The producer reminded Avery that the victor of the war was yet to be determined.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Phelps (2005), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

This cartoon has rarely been shown in the United States since World War II years. However, it has been shown on [[Cable News Network|CNN]], [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[Cartoon Network]] with the word "Japs" airbrushed out from the No Japs Allowed sign, and the scene involving a missile hitting [[Tokyo]] cut (this edited version is also available on the Region 2 Tex Avery 5-disc DVD set).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8694">'''Catastrophic optical damage''' ('''COD'''), or '''catastrophic optical mirror damage''' ('''COMD'''), is a failure mode of high-power [[semiconductor laser]]s. It occurs when the [[semiconductor junction]] is overloaded by exceeding its [[power density]] and absorbs too much of the produced light energy, leading to [[melting]] and [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]] of the [[semiconductor material]] at the facets of the laser. This is often colloquially referred to as "blowing the diode." The affected area contains a large number of [[lattice defect]]s, negatively affecting its performance. If the affected area is sufficiently large, it can be observable under [[optical microscope]] as darkening of the laser facet, and/or as presence of cracks and grooves. The damage can occur within a single laser pulse, in less than a millisecond. The time to COD is inversely proportional to the power density.

Catastrophic optical damage is one of the limiting factors in increasing performance of semiconductor lasers. It is the primary failure mode for [[AlGaInP]]/[[AlGaAs]] red lasers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afosr.af.mil/pages/afrtrl04.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213230544/http://www.afosr.af.mil/pages/afrtrl04.htm |date=February 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short-wavelength lasers are more susceptible to COD than long-wavelength ones.

The typical values for COD in industrial products range between 12 and 20 [[megawatt|MW]]/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Causes and mechanisms==
At the edge of a diode laser, where light is emitted, a mirror is traditionally formed by [[cleavage (crystal)|cleaving]] the semiconductor wafer to form a [[specular reflection|specularly reflecting]] plane. This approach is facilitated by the weakness of the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Miller index|110]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[crystallographic plane]] in III-V semiconductor crystals (such as [[GaAs]], [[Indium(III) phosphide|InP]], [[Gallium(II) antimonide|GaSb]], etc.) compared to other planes. A scratch made at the edge of the wafer and a slight bending force causes a nearly atomically perfect mirror-like cleavage plane to form and propagate in a straight line across the wafer.

But it so happens that the atomic states at the cleavage plane are altered (compared to their bulk properties within the crystal) by the termination of the perfectly periodic lattice at that plane. [[Surface states]] at the cleaved plane have [[energy level]]s within the (otherwise forbidden) [[band gap]] of the semiconductor.

The absorbed light causes generation of electron-hole pairs. These can lead to breaking of [[chemical bond]]s on the crystal surface followed by [[oxidation]], or to release of heat by [[nonradiative recombination]]. The oxidized surface then shows increased absorption of the laser light, which further accelerates its degradation. The oxidation is especially problematic for semiconductor layers containing aluminium.&lt;ref name="hpdl"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJs6nK3TZrwC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=%22catastrophic+optical+damage%22&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22catastrophic%20optical%20damage%22 |title=High-power diode lasers: fundamentals, technology, applications|page=195|author=Roland Diehl|publisher=Springer|year=2000|isbn=3-540-66693-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, as a result when light propagates through the cleavage plane and transits to free space from within the semiconductor crystal, a fraction of the light energy is absorbed by the surface states where it is converted to heat by [[phonon]]-[[electron]] interactions. This heats the cleaved mirror. In addition the mirror may heat simply because the edge of the diode laser—which is electrically [[laser pumping|pumped]]—is in less-than-perfect contact with the mount that provides a path for heat removal. The heating of the mirror causes the band gap of the semiconductor to shrink in the warmer areas. The band gap shrinkage brings more electronic band-to-band transitions into alignment with the photon energy causing yet more absorption. This is [[thermal runaway]], a form of [[positive feedback]], and the result can be melting of the facet, known as ''catastrophic optical damage'', or COD.

Deterioration of the laser facets with aging and effects of the environment (erosion by water, oxygen, etc.) increases light absorption by the surface, and decreases the COD threshold. A sudden catastrophic failure of the laser due to COD then can occur after many thousands hours in service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Te3yNTMLWE4C&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=%22catastrophic+optical+damage%22&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22catastrophic%20optical%20damage%22&amp;f=false |title=Diode laser arrays|author=Dan Botez, Don R. Scifres|page=314|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994 |isbn=0-521-41975-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improvements==
One of the methods of increasing the COD threshold in [[Aluminium gallium indium phosphide|AlGaInP]] laser structures is the [[sulfur]] treatment, which replaces the [[oxide]]s at the laser facet with [[chalcogenide glass]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.104833|title=Improvement of catastrophic optical damage level of AlGaInP visible laser diodes|year=1991|last1=Kamiyama|first1=Satoshi|last2=Mori|first2=Yoshihiro|last3=Takahashi|first3=Yasuhito|last4=Ohnaka|first4=Kiyoshi|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=58|pages=2595|bibcode = 1991ApPhL..58.2595K|issue=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This decreases the recombination velocity of the surface states.&lt;ref name="hpdl"/&gt;

Reduction of recombination velocity of surface states can be also achieved by cleaving the crystals in ultrahigh [[vacuum]] and immediate deposition of a suitable passivation layer.&lt;ref name="hpdl"/&gt;

A thin layer of aluminium can be deposited over the surface, for [[getter]]ing the oxygen.&lt;ref name="hpdl"/&gt;

Another approach is doping of the surface, increasing the band gap and decreasing absorption of the lasing wavelength, shifting the absorption maximum several nanometers up.&lt;ref name="hpdl"/&gt;

[[Current crowding]] near the mirror area can be avoided by prevention of injecting [[charge carrier]]s near the mirror region. This is achieved by depositing the electrodes away from the mirror, at least several carrier diffusion distances.&lt;ref name="hpdl"/&gt;

Energy density on the surface can be reduced by employing a [[waveguide]] broadening the optical cavity, so the same amount of energy exits through a larger area. Energy density of 15–20 MW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; corresponding to 100&amp;nbsp;mW per micrometer of stripe width are now achievable. A wider laser stripe can be used for higher output power, for the cost of transverse mode oscillations and therefore worsening of spectral and spatial beam quality.&lt;ref name="hpdl"/&gt;

In the 1970s, this problem, which is particularly nettlesome for GaAs-based lasers emitting between 1&amp;nbsp;µm and 0.630&amp;nbsp;µm wavelengths (less so for InP based lasers used for long-haul telecommunications which emit between 1.3&amp;nbsp;µm and 2&amp;nbsp;µm), was identified. Michael Ettenberg, a researcher and later Vice President at [[RCA]] Laboratories' [[David Sarnoff Research Center]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], devised a solution. A thin layer of [[aluminum oxide]] was deposited on the facet. If the aluminum oxide thickness is chosen correctly, it functions as an [[anti-reflective coating]], reducing reflection at the surface. This alleviated the heating and COD at the facet.&lt;!--Why?--&gt;

Since then, various other refinements have been employed. One approach is to create a so-called non-absorbing mirror (NAM) such that the final 10&amp;nbsp;µm or so before the light emits from the cleaved facet are rendered non-absorbing at the wavelength of interest. Such lasers are called '''window lasers'''.

In the very early 1990s, SDL, Inc. began supplying high power diode lasers with good reliability characteristics. CEO Donald Scifres and CTO David Welch presented new reliability performance data at, e.g., [[The International Society for Optical Engineering|SPIE]] Photonics West conferences of the era. The methods used by SDL to defeat COD were considered to be highly proprietary and have still not been disclosed publicly as of June, 2006.

In the mid-1990s IBM Research (Ruschlikon, [[Switzerland]]) announced that it had devised its so-called "E2 process" which conferred extraordinary resistance to COD in GaAs-based lasers. This process, too, has never been disclosed as of June, 2006.

'''Coding bootcamps''' are intensive programs of [[software development]] which started in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/08/coding-bootcamps-are-replacing-computer-science-degrees/|title=Coding bootcamps are replacing computer science degrees|last=Choxi|first=Roshan|date=2015|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-02-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Coding bootcamps made their debut in 2011 with the Code Academy (now Starter League). Since then, many others have followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/what-hacker-apprenticeships-tell-us-about-the-future-of-education/251039/|title=What Hacker Apprenticeships Tell Us About the Future of Education|last=Moon|first=Joe|date=2012|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-02-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2017, there were 95 full-time coding bootcamp courses in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/in-2016-the-coding-bootcamp-bubble-is-bound-to-burst/|title=In 2016, The Coding Bootcamp Bubble Is Bound to Burst|last=Lapowsky|first=Issie|date=2016|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-02-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of courses typically ranges from between 8 to 36 weeks, with most lasting 10 to 12 (averaging 12.9) weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-job-placement-2017|title=2017 Coding Bootcamp Market Size Study|last=|first=|date=|website=www.coursereport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collaboration with higher education ===
Following the increased popularity of coding bootcamps, some universities have started their own intensive coding programs or partnered with existing private coding bootcamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/blog/collaboration-in-higher-education-universities-coding-bootcamps|title=Collaboration in Higher Education: Universities + Coding Bootcamps|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online coding bootcamps ===
There are various online options for online bootcamps. Bootcamps usually match students with a mentor and are also generally cheaper and more accommodating to specific student needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2016-08-11/4-things-to-know-about-online-coding-boot-camps|title=4 Things to Know About Online Coding Boot Camps|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data science bootcamps and fellowships ===
Bootcamps that focus less on [[Solution stack|full stack development]] and more on producing [[Data science|data scientists]] and 
[[Information engineering|data engineers]] are known as data science bootcamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends/q-%22Data-Scientist%22-q-%22Data-Engineer%22.html|title="Data Scientist" and "Data Engineer" Job Trends|website=www.indeed.com|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tuition ==

Coding bootcamps can be part-time or online, they may be funded by employers or qualify for student loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/29/edtechs-next-big-disruption-is-the-college-degree/|title=Edtech’s Next Big Disruption Is The College Degree|last=Skonnard|first=Aaron|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2017 market research report, tuition ranged from free to $21,000 for a course, with an average tuition of $11,874.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-job-placement-2017|title=2017 Coding Bootcamp Market Size Study|last=|first=|date=|website=www.coursereport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Deferred Tuition" refers to a payment model in which students pay the school a percentage (18%-22.5%) of their salary for 1–3 years after graduation, instead of upfront tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/blog/coding-bootcamp-deferred-tuition-income-share-agreements|title=Deferred Tuition|last=|first=|date=|website=www.coursereport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, coding bootcamps can be free or a couple thousand euros per program. In contrast to formal university education, private offerings for training appear expensive. {{Citation needed|reason= Please cite|date=April 2018}}

On August 16, 2016, the US Department of Education announced up to $17 million in loans or grants for students to study with nontraditional training providers, including coding bootcamps.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-administration-to-fund-nontraditional-training-for-students-1471341782|title=Obama Administration to Fund Nontraditional Training for Students|last=Mitchell|first=Josh|date=2016-08-16|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These grants or loans will be administered through the pilot program, EQUIP which stands for Educational Quality through Innovation Partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-08-16-the-equip-eight-dept-of-ed-selects-partners-for-higher-education-experiment|title=The EQUIP Eight: Dept. of Ed Selects Partners for Higher Education Experiment (EdSurge News)|date=2016-08-16|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Programs must partner with an accredited college and third-party quality assurance entity (QAE) in order to receive federal financial aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/03/18/groups-seek-become-quality-reviewers-boot-camps-online-courses-and-other-noncollege|title=Groups seek to become quality reviewers of boot camps, online courses and other noncollege offerings|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In 2016, there were concerns that partnering private coding bootcamps with federal financial aid could attract less reputable organizations to create coding bootcamp programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2016/08/22/keep-coding-bootcamps-great-dont-give-them-taxpayer-money/#7821bb1350a0|title=Keep Coding Bootcamps Great: Don't Give Them Taxpayer Money|last=Cooper|first=Preston|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barriers to entry and exit mean established schools face less competition than in a free market, which can lead to deterioration of quality, and increase in prices. Also, problems within traditional university models could easily transfer to the university/bootcamp partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/08/16/colleges-partner-with-training-bootcamps-and-online-course-providers-for-federal-experiment/|title=Colleges partner with training boot camps and online course providers for federal experiment|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, others believe that enhancing policy around financial aid will help lower income prospective students attend. There are several sentiments of coding bootcamps being accessible only for the rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/06/are-coding-bootcamps-only-for-the-rich/|title=Are coding bootcamps only for the rich?|last=Pathak|first=Prasid|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54638">[[File:Protests against Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).jpg|thumbnail|right|Iranians protest the JCPOA outside the [[Iranian parliament]]]]

The '''[[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]]''', more commonly known as the '''Iran nuclear deal''' was the international agreement reached on [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear program]] in [[Vienna]] in 2015. The deal, made after several years of negotiation, set in place strict guidelines to regulate and oversee the Iranian nuclear program including the reduction of [[centrifuges]], [[enriched uranium]] stockpiles, and an agreement to allow regular inspections of nuclear sites, among other aspects. The deal has attracted enormous criticism by certain political and media elements in the [[United States]] and [[Iran]] as the deal is viewed as conciliatory in nature by some factions in both countries. For example, [[Donald Trump|President Donald J. Trump]] called the Iran deal, “the worst deal ever negotiated”&lt;ref name="The Timez Editorial Board 2018"&gt;{{cite web | author=The Times Editorial Board | title=Trump is inching closer to blowing up the Iran nuclear deal | website=latimes.com | date=2018-01-13 | url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-trump-iran-20180113-story.html | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and United States [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]] characterized it as "flawed",&lt;ref name="MitchFlawed 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Editorial | first=Reuters | title=McConnell says Iran agreement flawed, promises thorough review | website=U.S. | date=2015-07-14 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-congress-mcconnell/mcconnell-says-iran-agreement-flawed-promises-thorough-review-idUSKCN0PO1MT20150714 | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; while hardliners in Iran have indicated a desire to subvert it.&lt;ref name="Erdbrinkz 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Erdbrink | first=Thomas | title=Iran Celebrates Nuclear Deal, Tempered by Cynicism and Hard-Liner Warnings | website=The New York Times | date=2015-07-14 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-celebrates-nuclear-deal-tempered-by-cynicism-and-hard-liner-warnings.html | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the criticism in the United States has been centered on the issue of appeasement and Iran's compliance, while in Iran many of the criticisms revolve around the issue of sovereignty and non-nuclear restrictions.&lt;ref name="TIME.com 2013"&gt;{{cite web | title=Not Everyone’s Happy: Hardliners in Iran Criticize Geneva Nuclear Deal | website=TIME.com | date=2013-11-25 | url=http://world.time.com/2013/11/25/not-everyones-happy-hardliners-in-iran-criticize-geneva-nuclear-deal/ | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iran, debate over the deal has become representative of a number of persisting social, economic, and political conflicts that have played a large role in the rift between [[moderates]], [[reformists]], and [[conservatives]].&lt;ref name="Fisher 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Fisher | first=Max | title=How the nuclear deal boosted Iran's moderates - and showed Iranian elections can matter | website=Vox | date=2016-03-02 | url=https://www.vox.com/2016/3/2/11147102/iran-election-moderates-nuclear-deal | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the deal is seen as a symbol in the battle between competing visions on how the United States should carry out its [[United States foreign policy in the Middle East|foreign policy in the Middle East]].

Negotiation on Iran's nuclear program between the international community and Iran have occurred on and off since 2006, however the negotiations that led to the 2015 framework agreement, and the eventual final agreement, began in March 2013.&lt;ref name="Arms Control Association 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=Timeline of Nuclear Diplomacy With Iran | website=Arms Control Association | date=2018-01-12 | url=https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheet/Timeline-of-Nuclear-Diplomacy-With-Iran | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These talks, spearheaded by State Department officials [[Jake Sullivan]] and [[William Joseph Burns]], were conducted with an Iranian delegation led by Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Asghar Khaji.&lt;ref name="Editorialz 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Editorial | first=Reuters | title=U.S., Iran held secret talks on march to nuclear deal | website=U.S. | date=2013-11-24 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-bilateral/u-s-iran-held-secret-talks-on-march-to-nuclear-deal-idUSBRE9AN0FB20131124 | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial meetings were largely fruitless but June 2013 saw the election of [[Hassan Rouhani]], a centrist and reformist from the [[Moderation and Development Party]]. Rouhani had previously served as [[Supreme National Security Council|Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council]] and as such had been Iran's lead nuclear negotiator as recently as 2005.&lt;ref name="Naji 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Naji | first=Kasra | title=Profile: Hassan Rouhani | website=BBC News | date=2017-05-20 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-22886729 | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his inauguration in August 2013 and during a phone call with [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] in September 2013, Rouhani relayed his intent to restart negotiations with the West on the nuclear issue.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=At inauguration Hassan Rouhani urges more talks | website=Al Jazeera | date=2017-08-05 | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/inauguration-hassan-rouhani-urges-talks-170805130014403.html | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 2013, the [[P5+1]] countries and Iran reached a pact known as the [[Joint Plan of Action]]. This interim agreement was signed in [[Geneva]] and included provisions that limited Iran's use of [[enriched uranium]], restricted the installation of new [[centrifuges]], and allowed [[IAEA]] supervision of several [[Nuclear facilities in Iran|Iranian nuclear sites]], all in exchange for modest sanctions relief by the United States. The plan was slated to go into effect in January 2014.&lt;ref name="Washington Post JPAINTERIM"&gt;{{cite web | title=World powers reach nuclear deal with Iran to freeze its nuclear program | website=Washington Post | date=2013-11-23 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kerry-in-geneva-raising-hopes-for-historic-nuclear-deal-with-iran/2013/11/23/53e7bfe6-5430-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further negotiations between [[P5+1]] and Iran took place over the course of 2014 in pursuit of a more comprehensive deal. In June 2014, the deadline to meet the goal of a comprehensive agreement was not met and the deadline was therefore extended to November 2014. After the goal of November 2014 was not met, another extension was made to June 2015.&lt;ref name="Lyons 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Lyons | first=Kate | title=Iran nuclear talks: timeline | website=the Guardian | date=2015-07-14 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/iran-nuclear-talks-timeline | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, the negotiations produced a [[Iran nuclear deal framework|framework deal]] which included provisions for intensified inspections by the IAEA, and increased restrictions on the nuclear program.&lt;ref name="Borger Lewis 2015FRAMEWORK"&gt;{{cite web | last=Borger | first=Julian | last2=Lewis | first2=Paul | title=Iran nuclear deal: negotiators announce 'framework' agreement | website=the Guardian | date=2015-04-02 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/iran-nuclear-deal-negotiators-announce-framework-agreement | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The details of the plan were not worked out until negotiations of the plan concluded three months later. Talks over the specifics of the framework deal were carried out over the course of these three months primarily between [[United States|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] and [[Foreign Minister of Iran|Iranian Foreign Minister]] [[Mohammad Javad Zarif]] with the other foreign ministers of [[P5+1]] also taking part. On 14 July 2015, after seventeen days of near uninterrupted negotiations and a deadline extension, P5+1 and Iran reached a finalized agreement, the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]].&lt;ref name="SeventeenDays 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Porter | first=Gareth | title=Behind the Scenes: How the US and Iran Reached Their Landmark Deal | website=The Nation | date=2015-09-05 | url=https://www.thenation.com/article/behind-the-scenes-how-the-us-and-iran-reached-their-landmark-deal/ | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IAEA]] inspectors spend 3,000 calendar days per year in Iran, installing tamper-proof sealings and collecting surveillance camera photos, measurement data and documents. IAEA representatives asserted (e.g. in March 2018) that they have verified that Iran is implementing its nuclear-related commitments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-generals-introductory-remarks-at-press-conference IAWA director general Yukiya Amano: Introductory remarks at press conference], 5 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key provisions of the JCPOA===

*Reduction of Iran's stockpile of [[enriched uranium]] by 98%, from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms, to be maintained over fifteen years. Remaining uranium will only be authorized to be enriched to 3.67%, the level adequate enough for use in civilian [[nuclear power]] and research. Existing enriched uranium above the 3.67% mark will be sold or diluted. All research and development into enriched uranium is limited for a period of eight years and may only be conducted at the [[Natanz#nuclear facility|Natanz nuclear facility]] in [[Isfahan Province|Isfahan Province, Iran]]. 
*An exhaustive system of inspections by international observers from the [[IAEA]] will be put in place. This system will include a continuous monitoring of all aspects of Iran's nuclear supply chain such as [[uranium]] mills, observation by [[infrared]] [[satellites]], [[fiber optic]] seals on equipment, sensors, and surveillance cameras. Dedicated IAEA inspectors for [[Iran]], will triple from 50 to 150. IAEA inspectors also have the ability to request physical access to sites if specific concerns of non-compliance arise. 
*Iran will cut down on the number of operational [[centrifuges]]. Of its 19,000 centrifuges, all but 6,104 will be put in storage with an even smaller amount allowed to enrich uranium for a period of ten years. All of the stored centrifuges must be held at the [[Natanz]] site under [[IAEA]] supervision.
*Iran is forbidden from constructing additional heavy water sites or accumulating additional heavy water for a period of fifteen years. Iran's existing [[IR-40|Arak heavy water reactor site]] will be forbidden from producing power above 20 MWth (megawatt thermal) and will undergo a redesign to limit its capability to produce [[Reactor-grade plutonium|weapons grade plutonium]]. All heavy water in Iran's possession that exceeds the limitations of the deal will be placed for sale on the international market. 
*Iran will not participate in [[Nuclear reprocessing|spent fuel reprocessing]] in any capacity for a period of fifteen years and all [[Spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel]] in Iran will be shipped out of the country.
*The [[Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant]] will be forbidden from holding fissile material. Of the 2,700 IR-1 [[centrifuges]] currently installed at Fordow, only 1,044 will be allowed to remain. Enriching of uranium at the site will also be heavily restricted.
*A "snapback" mechanism that automatically replaces all [[Sanctions against Iran|international sanctions on Iran]] if compliance of the agreement is not met.&lt;ref name="Panda Diplomat 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Panda | first=Ankit | last2=Diplomat | first2=The | title=How the Iran Deal's 'Snap Back' Mechanism Will Keep Tehran Compliant | website=The Diplomat | date=2015-07-15 | url=https://thediplomat.com/2015/07/how-the-iran-deals-snap-back-mechanism-will-keep-tehran-compliant/ | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Key Excerpts of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) | website=whitehouse.gov | date=2015-07-14 | url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/14/key-excerpts-joint-comprehensive-plan-action-jcpoa | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial features==

===Sanctions relief===

The lifting of economic and military sanctions on [[Iran]] led to much ire among conservatives and some liberals in the [[United States]] who viewed the move as detrimental to security in the region.&lt;ref name="ire 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Lawmakers alarmed over Iranian nuclear windfall | website=USA TODAY | date=2015-07-05 | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/07/05/lawmakers-alarmed-iran-nuclear-windfall/29652429/ | access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the money [[Iranian frozen assets|frozen in foreign banks]] that would become available to the regime upon the deal's implementation was estimated to be between $29 billion and $150 billion. Money that, critics claim, would lead to increasing expenditures on Iran's military capability and a financial boost to proxy groups in the region such as [[Hezbollah]] in [[Lebanon]] and [[Houthis|Houthi rebels]] in [[Yemen]]. The billions of dollars Iran would have access to was assailed as a "signing bonus" by some critics. However, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of Treasury]] estimated that Iran's [[liquid assets]] after the sanctions relief would be only $50 billion, most of which would not go to military activities because of Iran's  dire need for [[foreign reserves]].&lt;ref name="Gladstoness 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Gladstone | first=Rick | title=Value of Iran Sanctions Relief Is Hard to Measure | website=The New York Times | date=2015-08-05 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/world/middleeast/conflicting-claims-cloud-irans-financial-gain-in-nuclear-deal.html | access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on Israel===
{{POV|date=January 2018}}
Shortly after the announcement of the deal, critics within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Israel lobby in the United States]] lambasted the move as a rebuff to Israel and a blatant undermining of [[Israel-United States relations]]. In addition, the deal was characterized as a threat to Israel's national security on the basis that it would to lead to an empowerment of anti-Israel actors in the region and the deal would actually facilitate [[Iran's nuclear program]] rather than hamper it. [[Tom Cotton|Senator Tom Cotton]] (R-[[arkansas|AR]]) visited Israel and met with Israeli [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu]] shortly after the announcement of the deal and vocalized his commitment to Israel. Prior to the visit, Cotton has said his solution to Iran's nuclear program would be a  “credible threat of military force”.&lt;ref name="Washington Postzzz 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title=Tom Cotton: No ordinary freshman congressman | website=Washington Post | date=2012-12-05 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2012/12/05/tom-cotton-no-ordinary-freshman-congressman/ | access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beinarzt 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Beinart | first=Peter | title=Why the Iran Deal Makes Obama's Critics So Angry | website=The Atlantic | date=2015-07-14 | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/07/iran-nuclear-deal-obama/398450/ | access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the Iran nuclear deal a "historic mistake", told [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] that Israel was under increased threat because of the deal and said in a statement, “In the coming decade, the deal will reward Iran, the terrorist regime in [[Tehran]], with hundreds of billions of dollars. This cash bonanza will fuel Iran’s terrorism worldwide, its aggression in the region and its efforts to destroy Israel, which are ongoing.”&lt;ref name="Kershnerses 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kershner | first=Isabel | title=Iran Deal Denounced by Netanyahu as ‘Historic Mistake’ | website=The New York Times | date=2015-07-14 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-israel.html | access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many conservatives in the United States claimed the deal would usher a financial windfall for Iranian sponsored groups in the Middle East that pose a threat to Israel including [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]]. In addition the lack of focus on Iran's ballistic missile program and the lifting of weapons embargoes was also viewed as a peril for Israel.&lt;ref name="The Iran Primerss 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Republican and Democratic Platforms on Iran | website=The Iran Primer | date=2016-07-25 | url=http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2016/jul/25/republican-and-democratic-platforms-iran | access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]] criticized what he viewed as the deal's "near total silence on Iran's missile programs.”&lt;ref name="JNi.Medias 2017"&gt;{{cite web | author=JNi.Media | title=Israel, Saudis, Applaud, Europe Condemns Republicans’ Interjecting Realism into Iran Nuke Deal - The Jewish Press - 25 Tishri 5778 – October 14, 2017 - JewishPress.com | website=JewishPress.com | date=2017-10-14 | url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/us-news/israel-saudis-applaud-europe-condemns-republicans-interjecting-realism-into-iran-nuke-deal/2017/10/14/ | access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspection regime===

Under the deal, international monitors are authorized to monitor declared Iranian nuclear sites through numerous electronic means including but not limited to: fiber-optic seals, cameras, sensors that detect radioactive particles, and commercial satellite imagery.  President Obama said that [[IAEA]] inspectors would have "24/7 access" to Iran's "key nuclear facilities."&lt;ref name="The New York Times 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Text and Video: Obama’s Address on the Iran Nuclear Deal | website=The New York Times | date=2015-07-14 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/text-and-video-obamas-address-on-the-iran-nuclear-deal.html | access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claimed that the inspection regime would not provide sufficient access to Iran's military sites.

==Opposition in Iran==
[[File:Protest against JCPOA during Ali Akbar Salehi speech in the Parliament.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Ali Akbar Salehi]], head of Iran's atomic energy agency, is heckled by anti-JCPOA members of the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]].]]
Iran was less bitterly divided over the deal than the United States but opposition in the form of hardliners, especially in more conservative religious institutions such as the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] still existed. These hardliners are concentrated more in Iran's unelected governmental institutions such as the aforementioned Revolutionary Guards, the [[Basij]], the [[Assembly of Experts]], and the [[Guardian Council]]. These bodies wield immense power in the [[Islamic Republic of Iran|Islamic Republic]] and are composed largely of clerical elites and religious reactionaries who bitterly oppose the [[Western world|West]] and [[Western culture|Western ideals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobepost.com/2018/05/01/iran-nuclear-talks-security/|title=Iran Deal: a Stepping Stone to Further Talks on Regional Security|last=Knott|first=Paul|date=2018-05-01|work=The Globe Post|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those more open to the deal included Iran's centrists and reformists who are characterized by a greater openness to foreign cultures, [[secularization]], and [[economic globalization]]. The JCPOA created a rift at the highest levels of government as evidenced by a leaked government directive to media outlets which urged them to praise the deal and its negotiators and avoid criticism.&lt;ref name="Naji 2015"&gt;{{cite web |last=Naji |first=Kasra |title=Iranian press 'ordered to praise nuclear deal' |publisher=BBC News |date=2015-07-26 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33668390 |access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hassan Rouhani in Yazd 05.jpg|thumbnail|right|President [[Hassan Rouhani]]]]
Iranian president [[Hassan Rouhani]], who in many ways paved the way for the deal, said the alternative to the deal was an "economic Stone Age" brought on by sanctions and economic isolation. He also chastised the Revolutionary Guard Corps for its opposition.&lt;ref name="Erdbrink Gladstone 2015"&gt;{{cite web |last=Erdbrink |first=Thomas |last2=Gladstone |first2=Rick |title=Iran’s President Defends Nuclear Deal in Blunt Remarks |website=The New York Times |date=2015-07-23 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/24/world/middleeast/irans-president-defends-nuclear-deal-in-blunt-remarks.html |access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]] gave his tacit approval of the deal and characterized it as a win for Iran exclaiming, “After 12 years of struggling with the Islamic republic, the result is that they have to bear the turning of thousands of centrifuges in the country,” a move that is likely to quell the resistance of the country's hardliner factions.&lt;ref name="Erdbrink 2015"&gt;{{cite web |last=Erdbrink |first=Thomas |title=Ayatollah Khamenei, Backing Iran Negotiators, Endorses Nuclear Deal |website=The New York Times |date=2015-07-16 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/world/middleeast/ayatollah-ali-khamenei-of-iran-backs-negotiators-and-doesnt-criticize-nuclear-deal.html |access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardliners are against the deal for a variety of the reasons, notably their desire to turn Iran into a nuclear armed state in order to deter the [[United States]] and [[Israel]], its violations of the [[Ali Khamenei|Ayatollah Khamenei]]'s red lines, and their belief that international inspections are a front for American intelligence-gathering.&lt;ref name="Milans McFaul 2015"&gt;{{cite web |last=Milani |first=Abbas |last2=McFaul |first2=Michael |title=What Do Iranians Think of the Iran Deal? |website=The Atlantic |date=2015-08-11 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/08/iran-deal-politics-rouhani-khamenei/400985/ |access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unofficially, members of the Revolutionary Guard worry that opening Iran up to global trade with the removal of sanctions will impede the organization's profits. The Revolutionary Guard Corps is believed to control a third of Iran's economy, a staggeringly high figure that could be reduced with more international commerce.&lt;ref name="Gregory 2010"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregory |first=Mark |title=Iran's Revolutionary Guards and their business empire |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-07-26 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-10743580 |access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic liberalization brought on by the deal could loosen the IRGC's control of the economy and lead to fresh resentment within the organization. In addition, the removal of U.S. sanctions also denies the Guard Corps from using the United States, or the West for that matter, as a propaganda tool and scapegoat for Iran's domestic problems.&lt;ref name="Milani McFaul 2015"&gt;{{cite web |last=Milani |first=Abbas |last2=McFaul |first2=Michael |title=What Do Iranians Think of the Iran Deal? |website=The Atlantic |date=2015-08-11 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/08/iran-deal-politics-rouhani-khamenei/400985/ |access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prominent opponents of the JCPOA in Iran is former [[Supreme National Security Council|Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council]] [[Saeed Jalili]] who lambasted the deal and its negotiators for having offered too many concessions to American negotiators.&lt;ref name="akarami"&gt;{{cite web |author=akarami |title=Former Iran deal negotiator slams concessions in nuclear deal |website=Al-Monitor |url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ru/originals/2015/09/jalili-jcpoa-nuclear-concessions.html |access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jalili claimed the nuclear deal “violated Iran's independence and national sovereignty.”&lt;ref name="Rezaei2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Farhad Rezaei|title=Iran’s Nuclear Program: A Study in Proliferation and Rollback|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YJLZDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|date=5 January 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-44120-7|pages=230–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media in Iran is also divided on partisan lines as well, with conservative newspapers such as the ''[[Kayhan]]'' newspaper and ''[[Ettelaat]]'' newspaper publishing articles that opposed the deal.&lt;ref name="Kangarlou 2015"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kangarlou |first=Tara |title=Tehran’s Nuclear Pact Debate Mirrors Washington's |website=Al Jazeera America |date=2015-08-13 |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/8/13/why-tehrans-debate-over-nuclear-pact-mirrors-washingtons.html |access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ways, the battle over the [[JCPOA]] is a [[Proxy fight|proxy conflict]] in the overarching debate over the future of Iran. The factions of the Iranian political spectrum who support the deal are the same faction who support [[globalization]], less religious influence in government, and a moderate [[foreign policy]] while those who oppose the deal are the same faction that advocate for a more religiously conservative society, the "[[Resistive economy|resistance economy]]", and more military intervention abroad.&lt;ref name="Milani McFaul 2015" /&gt; Nevertheless, the Iranian parliament approved the Iran deal 161-59-13 sending it to the [[Guardian Council]] which passed it with a "strong majority".&lt;ref&gt;Iran's Guardian Council passes nuclear bill into law https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-law/irans-guardian-council-passes-nuclear-bill-into-law-idUSKCN0S81OW20151014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges to the JCPOA===
[[File:Ali Khamenei with the Revolutionary Guard Corps and Basij - Mashhad (52).jpg|thumbnail|right|Ali Khamenei with members of the Revolutionary Guard Corps.]]
Outside of conservative political backlash there still remains a great litany of economic, social, and military challenges to the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal within [[Iran]] itself. Much of the popular support for the Iran deal comes from the public's perception of economic upsurges as a result of the sanctions relief brought on by the [[JCPOA]]. If the [[Economy of Iran|Iranian economy]] continues to remain stagnated, and foreign investment remains low, it is likely the public will turn away from the nuclear deal since it did not bring the level of economic relief that many Iranians banked their support of the deal on. This is evidenced by the 13% drop in approval of the deal among Iranians in the year after the deal was reached.&lt;ref name="The Iran Primer 2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=Poll 1: Iranian Views on Nuclear Deal |website=The Iran Primer |date=2016-07-13 |url=http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2016/jul/14/poll-1-iranian-views-nuclear-deal |access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the implementation of the JCPOA many foreign investors have remained weary of Iran. Decades of global economic isolation have strengthened the "economy of resistance", or the self-sufficient economy developed under sanctions, and as a result many businesses are actually front companies for or directly linked to the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]]. Other aspects that have hampered [[foreign direct investment]] in the wake of the Iran deal include high levels of corruption and the arrest of foreigners suspected of [[espionage]]. Insufficient economic growth will almost assuredly impede the reformist presidency of [[Hassan Rouhani]] and lead to conservative gains that can further impede the [[JCPOA]].&lt;ref&gt;Challenges to the Nuclear Deal: The Economy https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/perspectives/PE200/PE218/RAND_PE218.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran's increasing military involvement in the [[Middle East]] may also present a challenge to the deal. The regional conflict between [[Sunni]] and [[Shiite]] proxy groups aggravates tensions between the region's powers and motivates Iran to "demonstrate its resolve" for the purpose of domestic audiences. The conflicts that arise as a result can lead to greater confrontation between the [[United States]] and [[Iran]] which can undermine the deal.&lt;ref&gt;Challenges to the Nuclear Deal: Geopolitics https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/perspectives/PE200/PE218/RAND_PE218.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition in the United States==

===Political opposition===

The Iran deal was met with almost unanimous derision and denunciation by [[conservatism in the United States|conservatives in the United States]]. Within days of the finalization of the deal, all [[Republican Party presidential candidates, 2016|Republican Party candidates for president in the 2016 election]] had issued a public statement criticizing the deal in one form or another. [[U.S. Senator]] from [[South Carolina]] and Republican candidate, [[Lindsey Graham]] called it a, "terrible deal" and a "death sentence for [[Israel]]."&lt;ref name="Lindsey Graham: Press Release 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=First to Weight In: Graham: | website=Lindsey Graham: Press Release | date=2015-07-16 | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=112098 | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement from former [[Governor of Florida|Florida governor]] [[Jeb Bush]] said, "The nuclear agreement announced by the Obama administration today is a dangerous, deeply flawed, and short sighted deal." [[Ben Carson]] called it a "historic mistake" while former [[Governor of Arkansas|Arkansas governor]] [[Mike Huckabee]] lambasted [[John Kerry]] for not standing strongly enough with [[Israel]]. [[Governor of New Jersey|New Jersey governor]] [[Chris Christie]] said "The deal threatens Israel, it threatens the [[United States]], and it turns 70 years of nuclear policy on its head."&lt;ref name="LoBianco Tatum 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=LoBianco | first=Tom | last2=Tatum | first2=Sophie | title=GOP 2016 hopefuls slam Iran nuclear deal - CNNPolitics | website=CNN | date=2015-07-14 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/14/politics/2016-candidates-iran-deal/index.html | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States Congress]], disparagement was equally fierce. [[Speaker of the House]] [[John Boehner]] told reporters in a briefing he thought it was a  “bad deal” but added he did not have all the details so he couldn't make a definitive statement.&lt;ref name="Editorial 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Editorial | first=Reuters | title=U.S. House Speaker Boehner says Iran accord looks like a 'bad deal' | website=U.S. | date=2015-07-14 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-boehner-deal/u-s-house-speaker-boehner-says-iran-accord-looks-like-a-bad-deal-idUSL2N0ZU13820150714 | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boehner later said he would "do everything" in his power to block the deal.&lt;ref name="Walsh Barrett 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Walsh | first=Deirdre | last2=Barrett | first2=Ted | title=Boehner vows to 'do everything' to block Iran deal - CNNPolitics | website=CNN | date=2015-07-22 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/22/politics/john-boehner-iran-deal-nuclear/index.html | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]] accused the Obama administration of approaching the talks with a  "flawed perspective" that prioritized Iran's interests over the "national goal" of [[Iran and weapons of mass destruction|Iranian nuclear disarmament]].&lt;ref name="ABC News Radio 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title=McConnell: Iran Deal a Result of 'Flawed Perspective' - Politics News | website=ABC News Radio | date=2011-05-12 | url=http://abcnewsradioonline.com/politics-news/mcconnell-iran-deal-a-result-of-flawed-perspective.html | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bob Corker]], U.S. Senator from [[Tennessee]] and chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] claimed it offered too many concessions to Iran and echoed other Republican leaders in describing it as counterproductive.&lt;ref name="USA TODAY 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Corker warns of 'breathtaking' concessions on Iran deal | website=USA TODAY | date=2015-06-15 | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/06/15/corker-says-back-away-from-iran-deal/71260448/ | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Burr]], U.S. Senator from [[North Carolina]] and chairman of the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] called it "dangerously limited" and criticized [[President Obama]] for "mischaracterizing" the threat Iran poses to the United States.&lt;ref name="U.S. Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Burr on Iran Deal: American People Aren’t Buying Into Bad Deal | website=U.S. Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina | date=2015-08-05 | url=https://www.burr.senate.gov/press/releases/burr-on-iran-deal-american-people-arent-buying-into-bad-deal- | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative [[Louie Gohmert]] of [[Texas's 1st congressional district]], who called the Iran deal a "move towards a [[nuclear holocaust]]",&lt;ref name="Talking Points Memo 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Gohmert Vows To Quit Congress And Await 'Nuclear Holocaust' If Iran Deal Passes | website=Talking Points Memo | date=2015-09-09 | url=https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/louie-gohmert-glenn-beck-iran | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a resolution into the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] that would classify the Iran nuclear deal as a [[treaty]] which, if passed, would require the Senate to vote on it. As it stands the Iran deal was made as an [[executive agreement]].

[[File:Tea Party Patriots Stop the Iran Nuclear Deal IMG 4628 (21293537052).jpg|thumbnail|right|Senator [[Ted Cruz]] delivers a speech before protesters denouncing the Iran nuclear deal.]]

A [[Stop Iran Rally|rally]] organized in July 2015 by Jeffrey Wiesenfeld, an investment management principal and child of [[Holocaust]] survivors, drew thousands of people to [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]] to protest the Iran deal. The crowd which numbered in the thousands chanted "Kill the deal!" and "Where is Chuck?" (in reference to Senator [[Chuck Schumer]]) and saw bipartisan speakers including [[George Pataki]] and [[Alan Dershowitz]].&lt;ref name="the Guardian 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Thousands pack New York’s Times Square to protest Iran nuclear deal with US | website=the Guardian | date=2015-07-23 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/23/thousands-pack-times-square-protest-iran-nuclear-deal-us | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Republican congressional leaders organized a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] rally on the [[U.S. Capitol|Capitol]] lawn to protest the terms of the [[JCPOA]]. For several hours hundreds of protesters voiced their opposition to the bill. Then-presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] headlined the rally alongside Senator [[Ted Cruz]]. Trump spoke against the deal saying he had never seen a deal as "incompetently negotiated" as the Iranian nuclear deal. Other speakers included former [[Governor of Alaska|Alaska governor]] [[Sarah Palin]] who similarly voiced opposition to the deal.&lt;ref name="Stokolz Gass 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Stokols | first=Eli | last2=Gass | first2=Nick | title=Trump storms Washington | website=POLITICO | date=2017-12-15 | url=https://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/donald-trump-iran-deal-washington-rally-213451 | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D dies in D 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Donald Trump, Ted Cruz headline Capitol rally against Iran nuclear deal | website=Washington Post | date=2015-09-09 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/09/donald-trump-ted-cruz-to-headline-capitol-rally-against-iran-nuclear-deal/ | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] widely praised the deal with Democratic candidate and former [[Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] releasing a statement announcing her support for the deal, "I support the agreement because it can help us prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. With vigorous enforcement, unyielding verification, and swift consequences for any violations, this agreement can make the United States, Israel, and our [[Arab]] partners safer," and, "we should applaud President Obama, [[John Kerry|Secretary Kerry]], and [[Ernest Moniz|Secretary Moniz]] for getting this done, and proceed with wisdom and strength in enforcing this deal to the fullest and in meeting the broader Iranian challenge."&lt;ref name="Yglesias 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Yglesias | first=Matthew | title=Hillary Clinton makes the case for Obama's Iran nuclear deal | website=Vox | date=2015-07-14 | url=https://www.vox.com/2015/7/14/8966945/hillary-clinton-statement-iran-deal | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vermont]] Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] also supported the deal in order to "give peace a chance."&lt;ref name="BernieHippie 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Bernie Sanders defends Iran nuclear deal | website=Washington Post | date=2015-08-09 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/09/bernie-sanders-defends-iran-nuclear-deal/ | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Jim Webb]] former Democratic senator from [[Virginia]] and [[Secretary of the Navy]] broke from other Democratic candidates, telling [[National Public Radio]] that he was skeptical of removing sanctions and believed that the U.S. had tacitly acknowledged that Iran will develop a nuclear weapon.&lt;ref name="Gass 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Gass | first=Nick | title=Webb breaks from 2016 Dems in dinging Iran deal | website=POLITICO | date=2015-07-15 | url=https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/jim-webb-criticize-iran-deal-120145.html | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]], Washington D.C. based pro-Israel [[501(c) organization|501(c)(4) organization]], purchased more than $25 million in television advertising to assail the deal and began a campaign of lobbying congressman in its effort to scrap the [[JCPOA]]. Alongside its subsidiary group, Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran, AIPAC's lobbying barrage targeted undecided Democratic politicians.&lt;ref name="Davis 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Davis | first=Julie Hirschfeld | title=It’s Either Iran Nuclear Deal or ‘Some Form of War,’ Obama Warns | website=The New York Times | date=2015-08-05 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/us/politics/obama-urges-critics-of-iran-deal-to-ignore-drumbeat-of-war.html | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR.org 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Lobbyists Spending Millions To Sway The Undecided On Iran Deal | website=NPR.org | date=2015-08-06 | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/06/429911872/in-iran-deal-fight-lobbyists-are-spending-millions-to-sway-12-senators | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polling===

A [[Cable News Network|CNN]]/[[Opinion Research Corporation|ORC]] poll conducted in mid-August 2015 showed that 52% of American registered voters believe Congress should reject the [[JCPOA]]&lt;ref name="Agiesta Diamond 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Agiesta | first=Jennifer | last2=Diamond | first2=Jeremy | title=Poll: Most Americans want Congress to reject Iran deal | website=CNN | date=2015-08-20 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/20/politics/iran-deal-poll-majority-americans-disapprove/index.html | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a poll by [[Pew Research Center]] in September showed that only 21% of its respondents supported the deal while the rest either opposed it or offered no opinion.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Support for Iran Nuclear Agreement Falls | website=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press | date=2015-09-08 | url=http://www.people-press.org/2015/09/08/support-for-iran-nuclear-agreement-falls/ | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However that same month the [[University of Maryland]] held a panel which featured expert-vetted arguments on both sides of the issue and found that after weighing all options, only 45% of respondents opposed the deal.&lt;ref name="UMD Right Now :: University of Maryland 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=UMD Study Finds that After Weighing Options, a Majority of Americans Approve Iran Nuclear Deal | website=UMD Right Now :: University of Maryland | date=2015-09-02 | url=https://www.umdrightnow.umd.edu/news/umd-study-finds-after-weighing-options-majority-americans-approve-iran-nuclear-deal | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll conducted on behalf of the [[American Jewish Committee]] found that 47% of American Jews disapprove of the deal, with only a narrow majority supporting it.&lt;ref name="JTA 2015"&gt;{{cite web | author=JTA | title=Jews Back Iran Deal by Narrow Margin, Poll Says | website=The Forward | date=2015-09-11 | url=https://forward.com/news/breaking-news/320816/jews-back-iran-deal-by-narrow-margin-poll-says/ | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll of [[Iranian-Americans]] found that 8 in 10 believed the agreement would improve ties between the [[United States]] and [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="paaia.org 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=PAAIA Releases National Public Opinion Survey of Iranian Americans &amp; the American Public - PAAIA | website=paaia.org | date=2015-08-12 | url=http://www.paaia.org/CMS/paaia-releases-national-public-opinion-survey-of-iranian-americans-american-public.aspx | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812183300/http://www.paaia.org/CMS/paaia-releases-national-public-opinion-survey-of-iranian-americans-american-public.aspx | archive-date=2015-08-12 | dead-url=yes | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CNN/ORC poll administered in October 2017 on the Iran deal showed that 67% of American respondents wanted to remain in the deal.&lt;ref name="Struyk 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Struyk | first=Ryan | title=CNN poll: Two-thirds want to stay in Iran nuclear deal | website=CNN | date=2017-10-20 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/20/politics/poll-trump-iran-deal-north-korea/index.html | access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experts===
William H. Tobey, a senior fellow in [[Harvard University|Harvard's]] [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]] expressed his opposition to the deal saying that Iran gave too few concessions in return for too much sanctions relief and that the deal was simply postponing Iran's development of a [[nuclear weapon]] rather than halting it, calling the deal a mere "speed bump" in the country's path to being nuclear armed.&lt;ref name="Mecklin 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Mecklin | first=John | title=The experts assess the Iran agreement of 2015 | website=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | date=2015-07-14 | url=https://thebulletin.org/experts-assess-iran-agreement-20158507 | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial written by former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst and vice president of the [[Center for Security Policy]], a [[Washington D.C.]] based [[conservative]] think tank, Frederick H. Fleitz, claimed that the deal was made at the expense of the United States and called it "not a verifiable agreement". Fleitz argued that since the [[IAEA]] only had non-negotiable access to declared nuclear sites and not military or missile facilities, the deal was toothless, and Iran could easily develop a nuclear weapon under the nose of international inspectors.&lt;ref name="Fleitz 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Fleitz | first=Fred | title=Iran nuclear deal much worse than experts predicted | website=Fox News | date=2015-07-14 | url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/14/iran-nuclear-deal-much-worse-than-experts-predicted.html | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James S. Robbins]], a senior fellow in the [[American Foreign Policy Council]] called the deal "impotent" in an editorial in [[US News &amp; World Report]] due to the fact it does little to hamper Iran's missile programs.&lt;ref name="Robbins 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Robbins | first=James S. | title=Iran Shoots a Hole in the Nuclear Deal | website=US News &amp; World Report | date=2016-03-15 | url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/articles/2016-03-15/iran-missile-test-reveals-weakness-of-nuclear-deal | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, a letter signed by 190 former generals and admirals was sent to Congressional leaders expressing opposition to the bill. The letter argued that the deal put too many limitations on IAEA access to Iranian sites, would provide Iran with $150 billion in sanctions relief much of which would surely go funding [[Iran and state-sponsored terrorism|Iranian proxy groups]] in the Middle East, and offered too few concessions from [[Iran]]. American national security, the five paragraph letter argued, would be put at risk if the deal was not rejected.&lt;ref name="Washington Post 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Read: An open letter from retired generals and admirals opposing the Iran nuclear deal | website=Washington Post | date=2015-07-14 | url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/read-an-open-letter-from-retired-generals-and-admirals-opposing-the-iran-nuclear-deal/1703/ | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the signers of the letter included [[Robert J. Kelly]], former commander-in-chief of the [[United States Pacific Fleet]], [[William G. Boykin]], former Deputy [[Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence]], Joseph Hoar, former commander of [[U.S. Central Command]], and Joe Sestak, former Navy vice admiral and Director for Defense on the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] under [[Bill Clinton]], among others. The letter was made in response to a letter signed by 36 generals and admirals praising the deal.&lt;ref name="Washington Post 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title=Read: An open letter from retired generals and admirals on the Iran nuclear deal | website=Washington Post | date=2012-06-07 | url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/read-an-open-letter-from-retired-generals-and-admirals-on-the-iran-nuclear-deal/1689/ | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to both letters, former [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] general [[Anthony Zinni]] said "I'm convinced that 90% of the guys who signed the letter one way or the other don't have any clue about whether it's a good or bad deal. They sign it because somebody's asked them to sign it."&lt;ref name="Thompson 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Thompson | first=Mark | title=Retired Generals Wage Letter War Over Iran Nuclear-Deal Vote | website=Time | date=2015-08-27 | url=http://time.com/4013966/iran-nuclear-vote-generals/ | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trump Administration===
The [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]] has characterized Iran as an adversary of the United States on numerous occasions and has been critical of the regime in [[Tehran]] and the Iran nuclear deal. Over the course of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], [[Donald Trump]] repeatedly attacked the deal. During a speech to the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC he said dismantling the Iranian nuclear deal was his first priority.&lt;ref name="Begleyz 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Begley | first=Sarah | title=Read Donald Trump's Speech to AIPAC | website=Time | date=2016-03-21 | url=http://time.com/4267058/donald-trump-aipac-speech-transcript/ | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a presidential debate he described it as a "horrible deal".&lt;ref name="Washington Postzz 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=The first Trump-Clinton presidential debate transcript, annotated | website=Washington Post | date=2016-09-26 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/26/the-first-trump-clinton-presidential-debate-transcript-annotated/ | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After assuming office, Trump administration [[National Security Adviser]] [[Michael Flynn]] placed Iran “officially on notice” during a February 1 press conference.&lt;ref name="NPR.org 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Flynn Puts Iran On Notice After Ballistic Missile Test | website=NPR.org | date=2017-02-02 | url=https://www.npr.org/2017/02/02/512998437/flynn-puts-iran-on-notice-after-ballistic-missile-test | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Trump administration shied away from outright dismantling the deal. Instead, in April 2017 it commenced a "policy review" during which time it announced it would continue to implement the [[JCPOA]]. The administration has continued to recertify the Iran deal despite President Trump's previous objections, most likely bowing to pressure from cabinet members [[Secretary of State]] [[Rex Tillerson]] and [[Secretary of Defense]] [[James Mattis]] who are proponents of the deal.&lt;ref name="Savransky 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Savransky | first=Rebecca | title=Tillerson: Staying in the Iran deal in best interest of the US | website=TheHill | date=2017-10-15 | url=http://thehill.com/policy/international/355508-tillerson-staying-in-the-iran-deal-in-best-interest-of-the-us | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Starr Cohen Browne 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Starr | first=Barbara | last2=Cohen | first2=Zachary | last3=Browne | first3=Ryan | title=Mattis: US should stay in Iran deal | website=CNN | date=2017-10-03 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/politics/mattis-iran-nuclear-deal-national-security/index.html | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=Trump waives Iran nuclear sanctions 'for last time' | website=Al Jazeera | date=2018-01-12 | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/trump-waives-iran-nuclear-sanctions-time-180112164307626.html | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, National Security Adviser [[H.R. McMaster]] has called the Iran deal "fundamentally flawed", and added the "incompleteness" of the deal "could give the regime cover to advance a nuclear program."&lt;ref name="Diaz 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Diaz | first=Daniella | title=McMaster: Iran deal 'fundamentally flawed' | website=CNN | date=2017-09-21 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/21/politics/h-r-mcmaster-donald-trump-iran-deal-white-house/index.html | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, McMaster invited a group of [[Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate|Democratic senators]] to the [[White House]] for a policy discussion on the deal. Those in the meeting reported that they felt as if the purpose of the discussion was to give McMaster talking points in his attempt to persuade President Trump to remain in the deal.&lt;ref name="Bashaa 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Bash | first=Dana | title=Senate Dems sense McMaster not sold on decertifying Iran deal | website=CNN | date=2017-10-05 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/05/politics/hr-mcmaster-iran-deal/index.html | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 January 2018, [[Donald Trump|President Trump]] issued another waiver of sanctions on Iran saying this was "to secure our European allies' agreement to fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal."&lt;ref name="Diamondzz 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Diamond | first=Jeremy | title=Trump issues warning, but continues to honor Iran deal | website=CNN | date=2018-01-12 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/12/politics/president-donald-trump-iran-deal-waiver/index.html | access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Stewart Alsop II]] realized he was more intrigued by the one-on-one demonstrations of coming technologies conducted in hallways and hotel rooms during the off hours during technology conferences.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/15/technology/state-of-the-art-onstage-digital-hits-and-misses.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted Alsop to found the first DEMO Conference in 1991.

:''For the 1956 conference on artificial intelligence, see [[Dartmouth workshop]].''

The '''Dartmouth Conference''' is the longest continuous bilateral dialogue between [[Americans|American]] and [[Soviet people|Soviet]] (now [[Russians|Russian]]) representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=Harold H.|title=A public peace process : sustained dialogue to transform racial and ethnic conflicts|date=1999|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-21939-3|page=xvi|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first '''Dartmouth Conference''' took place at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1961. Subsequent conferences were held through 1990. They were revived in 2014 and continue today. Task forces begun under the auspices of the main conference continued to work after the main conference stopped. The '''Regional Conflicts Task Force''' extended the [[Sustained dialogue|sustained dialogue model]], based on the Dartmouth experience, to conflicts in [[Tajikistan]] and [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. Dartmouth inspired a number of other dialogues in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere, many of them under the auspices of the [[Sustained Dialogue Institute]] and the [[Kettering Foundation]].

==Origin==
[[File:Norman Cousins.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|Norman Cousins]]
The Dartmouth Conference was begun by [[Norman Cousins]], editor of the [[Saturday Review of Literature]], and a founding member of the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (SANE). Speaking to the presidium of the [[Soviet Peace Committee]] in June 1959, he proposed that citizens of the United States and the Soviet Union meet to have informal discussions to widen contacts and to explore areas of contention between them.&lt;ref name=Bobrysheva7&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bobrysheva|first1=Alice|title=Thanks for the memories : my years with the Dartmouth Conference|date=2003|publisher=Kettering Foundation Press|location=Dayton, Ohio|isbn=0923993096|page=7|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After discussing the idea with [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] later that year, Cousins began to organize a meeting between prominent citizens of the two countries.

Together with Philip Mosely, a professor at Columbia, he organized the American side of the conference. The [[Soviet Peace Committee]] organized the Soviet side of the first conference and several that followed.  The Ford Foundation provided financial support for the American side.

That first conference took place in October 1960 on the campus of [[Dartmouth College]]. It began to set the model for the conferences that followed. The discussions covered most issues then important in [[Federal government of the United States|U.S.]]-[[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet]] relations. As later, they were kept off the record.

==Cold War conferences==
Several things distinguished the Dartmouth Conferences from others that brought Soviets and Americans together. For one, the participants came from a variety of backgrounds. The American participants at the first conference included [[Agnes DeMille]], the choreographer; [[Walter Rostow]], then an aide to John F, Kennedy; [[Grenville Clark]], a prominent lawyer; and Senator [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]] of Connecticut.  The Soviet delegation was led by a prominent playwright, [[Oleksandr Korniychuk]] and included a chemist, a composer, and an historian.&lt;ref name=voorhees31&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorhees|first1=James|title=Dialogue sustained : the multilevel peace process and the Dartmouth Conference|date=2002|publisher=Institute of Peace Press [u.a.]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1929223307|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent conferences included Members of Congress, prominent scholars, industrialists, and former diplomats, but also [[Marian Anderson]] and [[Arthur Miller]].&lt;ref name=Dartmouth50-63-81&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kettering Foundation|title=The Dartmouth Conference: The First 50 Years 1960-2010|date=2010|publisher=The Kettering Foundation|location=Dayton, OH|pages=63–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first conferences, the Soviet delegations were less diverse, but broadened after Soviet society began to [[Glasnost|open up]] after [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] in 1985. On the Soviet side, many of the participants came from policy-oriented institutes like ISKAN, including the [[Institute of World Economy and International Relations]] (IMEMO) and the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Oriental Studies]].

Discussion of a broad range of subjects was another distinguishing quality of Dartmouth. Whereas the [[Pugwash Conferences]], for example, focused on nuclear disarmament, Dartmouth covered the entire Soviet-American relationship. Arms control and disarmament were prominent, as was the state of the relationship itself.  Trade was frequently discussed, as were conflicts in the Third World, a perennial source of discord during the Cold War. Even environmental problems were addressed.

Early on, the conferences were not intended explicitly to influence policy. But this had changed by Dartmouth V in 1969.&lt;ref name=voorhees69&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorhees|first1=James|title=Dialogue sustained : the multilevel peace process and the Dartmouth Conference|date=2002|publisher=Institute of Peace Press [u.a.]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1929223307|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did seek to influence policy through meetings with officials, contacts available to participants. The results of the conferences were frequently communicated directly to officials. Each conference came to include meetings with Soviet or American officials. In addition, on a number of occasions, the American participants received official briefings beforehand. Indeed, in 1981, at the beginning of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]], Secretary of State [[Alexander Haig]] suggested points that the Americans should emphasize in their discussions at Dartmouth XIII.&lt;ref name=voorhees144&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorhees|first1=James|title=Dialogue sustained : the multilevel peace process and the Dartmouth Conference|date=2002|publisher=Institute of Peace Press [u.a.]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1929223307|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Member of Congress|members of Congress]] often took part, as did former officials from the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|Executive Branch]].

Participants like [[Georgy Arbatov]] and [[Yevgeny Primakov]] were well connected in the Soviet hierarchy. In addition, beginning with the first conference, reports were sent to the higher reaches of the Soviet bureaucracy,&lt;ref name=Bobrysheva36&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bobrysheva|first1=Alice|title=Thanks for the memories : my years with the Dartmouth Conference|date=2003|publisher=Kettering Foundation Press|location=Dayton, Ohio|isbn=0923993096|page=36|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Primakov attested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Primakov|first1=Yevgeny|title=Reminiscing on the Dartmouth Conference|url=http://old.ivran.ru/conference/dartmouth-conf/266|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1970, the [[Kettering Foundation]] took on primarily responsibility for the Dartmouth Conferences on the American side. On the Soviet side, that role was taken by the [[Soviet Peace Committee]], joined by the [[Institute for US and Canadian Studies]] (ISKAN), an arrangement that lasted through the end of the Cold War.&lt;ref name=voorhees69 /&gt;

Dartmouth XVII was the last conference held before the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. After that, the work of Dartmouth continued, but it was done under the auspices of the Regional Conflicts Task Force and the [[Kettering Foundation]]. In the new century, the Sustained Dialogue Institute took up much of what the task force had done.

== The Dartmouth Conference Reborn ==
In 2014, immediately following the outbreak of armed conflict in the eastern Ukraine, in which Russian fighters and heavy equipment were soon engaged, US-Russian contacts at the official level ceased.  The Bilateral Presidential Commissions created by Presidents Medvedev and Obama in 2009, in large part as a conflict management mechanism, was suspended.  The US and Europe imposed sanctions on Russia, which imposed its own sanctions in retaliation.  The result was that neither official nor informal, citizen-based channels were available to find creative ways out of what appeared to many to be a rapidly developing new Cold War.

Building upon its historical role, the [[Kettering Foundation]] proposed to [[Vitaly Naumkin]] and [[Harold H. Saunders|Harold Saunders]], co-chairmen of the Task Force on the U.S. - Russia Relationship, that the Dartmouth Conferences be renewed.  To assure the effectiveness of these conferences, each side sought and received support for this process at high levels of their governments.  In contrast to the more professional backgrounds of those in the task force, participants for this renewed Dartmouth Conference brought together distinguished figures from a wide variety of backgrounds in order to more adequately and persuasively represent public thinking.  Dartmouth XVIII convened in November 2014 on the campus of the [[Kettering Foundation]] in Dayton, OH.  After vigorous discussion of the concerns expressed by each side about the actions of the other, the participants focused on identifying steps that could be undertaken jointly to re-inject positive elements into the relationship.  A proposal for joint efforts in the medical field is now underway as are several other projects.  Meeting with US officials in Washington, DC, following the conference, participants were encouraged by a high State Department official to continue meeting, as "you are the only on-going bilateral discussions today in this critical relationship."

In response to a proposal from our Russian colleagues, Dartmouth XIX convened in March 2015 in Suzdal, Russia.  The context of this meeting was shaped by sharply declining prices for Russia's major export, oil; sharply intensifying differences over Ukraine and many other issues; and calls from influential Russian voices that Russia abandon all efforts to become an integral part of the Euro-Atlantic world.  In this context, as the report of the American delegation noted, "Powerful, influential elements in the Russian leadership, as they affirmed and re-affirmed to us, continue to see Russia as a part of the broader Euro-Atlantic community. However, Russia also has its own regional relationships,  interests, culture, history, traditions and values for which it demands respect."  In their joint report, the participants made a number of concrete recommendations.  These included, 1) reconvening the Bilateral Presidential Commissions, noting that their absence in a period of crisis was "a high price to pay;" 2) reconvening the NATO-Russia military council; 3) strengthening the conventional arms control regime in Europe; 4) deepening the Lavrov/Kerry dialogue on Syria with the objective of coordinating or at least keeping each other more fully informed of our approaches and strategies;  and 5) in regard to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], create a contact group to work on common approaches to such issues as controlling the flow of fighters, financing and possibly sharing ideas on the sensitive issue of Turkey’s role in this conflict.

Dartmouth XX met at [[Airlie House]] in [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton]], VA in late October 2015 to continue work on the broad agenda of US-Russia relations.

==Task forces==
During the 1970s, the conferences had come to include small meetings focused on particular issues. These had proven to be valuable&lt;ref name=Rockefeller&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rockefeller|first1=David|title=Memoirs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R84xS9eEgsAC&amp;pg=PT202&amp;dq=%27David+Rockefeller%27+Dartmouth+Conferences&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBWoVChMIwczQ9fG9yAIVyHQ-Ch1W5Ap4#v=onepage&amp;q='David%20Rockefeller'%20Dartmouth%20Conferences&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of establishing task forces to discuss particular issues between conferences was raised at Dartmouth IX in 1975. But it was not until the early 1980s that task forces began to meet regularly. They came to do some of the most important work associated with the Dartmouth Conference.

===The Regional Conflicts Task Force===
The Regional Conflicts Task Force first met in 1982. It was led by [[Yevgeny Primakov|Evgeny Primakov]] on the Soviet side and [[Harold H. Saunders|Harold Saunders]] on the American until Primakov left to take a senior position under [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]. His place was taken by Gennadi Chufrin, a scholar from the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]].  The Task Force met regularly until 2001, then worked directly on conflicts in [[Tajikistani Civil War|Tajikistan]] and over [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Nagorno-Karabakh]].

The task force had qualities different from those found at the main conferences. The meetings were more frequent, meeting twice a year until after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The participants changed less often.&lt;ref name=SaundersSustained36-37&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=Harold H.|title=Sustained dialogue in conflicts : transformation and change|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=9780230339804|pages=36–37|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Saunders’ estimation, these qualities allowed the discussions to become more analytical and begin a process that he believed could be important in resolving conflict.

Partly because of this, Saunders’ experience on the Regional Conflicts Task Force led him to develop a five-stage approach to international conflict resolution that he called ‘Sustained Dialogue.’&lt;ref name=SaundersSustained23-30&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=Harold H.|title=Sustained dialogue in conflicts : transformation and change|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=9780230339804|pages=23–30|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; That approach became the basis for several initiatives that stemmed from Dartmouth.

Immediately following the [[Russo-Georgian War]] in 2008, the Regional Conflicts Task Force initiated a new series of meetings focusing on addressing key issues in the U.S. - Russia relationship, from Ukraine and Georgia to Afghanistan, Syria, and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]].  Meeting roughly every six months, this task force held the 12th of these new meetings in July 2015, focusing on Afghanistan. It will convene its 13th meeting in January 2016 to discuss interactions between the two countries in Syria and their implications for our bilateral relationship.  As with the larger conference, each task force produces a specific set of recommendations that are communicated jointly to the two governments in face-to-face meetings.

===Other task forces===
The influence of the Regional Conflicts Task Force came to be essential to Dartmouth, especially after the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union collapsed. But several other task forces met during the 1980s and early 1990s.

The Arms Control Task Force began to meet in April 1983 under the leadership of [[Paul M. Doty|Paul Doty]] and [[Georgy Arbatov]]. It met a total of 15 times through ten years, ending its work in 1992. The subjects of the discussions mirrored the issued prominent in the official discussions taking place at the time. These included nuclear, chemical, and conventional arms control, denuclearization, missile defense, and security in Europe.&lt;ref name=voorhees159-285&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorhees|first1=James|title=Dialogue sustained : the multilevel peace process and the Dartmouth Conference|date=2002|publisher=Institute of Peace Press [u.a.]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1929223307|pages=159–164, 194–196, 201–203, 230–234, 250–255, 280–295}}&lt;/ref&gt; A measure of the cooperation the two sides achieved was that, in 1986, Arbatov made copies of the Soviet proposals on arms control that had been made at the [[Reykjavik Summit]].&lt;ref name=voorhees196&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorhees|first1=James|title=Dialogue sustained : the multilevel peace process and the Dartmouth Conference|date=2002|publisher=Institute of Peace Press [u.a.]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1929223307|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had been a member of the Soviet delegation that went to Iceland. After the [[Revolutions of 1989|Berlin Wall fell]], the discussion of the task force began to include additional topics, such as the [[Enlargement of NATO|expansion of NATO]] and nuclear proliferation in the face of the [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction#Soviet era|dispersal of Soviet weapons]] among [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name=voorhees230-295&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorhees|first1=James|title=Dialogue sustained : the multilevel peace process and the Dartmouth Conference|date=2002|publisher=Institute of Peace Press [u.a.]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1929223307|pages=230–234, 250–255, 280–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Political Relations Task Force met twice in 1986, and twice again in 1988 before its last meeting in January 1989. It was tasked with examining the prospects for the relationship between the two countries and the obstacles to improvement.&lt;ref name=voorhees179-181&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorhees|first1=James|title=Dialogue sustained : the multilevel peace process and the Dartmouth Conference|date=2002|publisher=Institute of Peace Press [u.a.]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1929223307|pages=179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in Soviet thinking then occurring as [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] gathered steam were prominent in the discussions and helped drive the agenda, but the discussions addressed events in both countries. Meetings in both Washington and Moscow were attended by [[Member of Congress|Members of Congress]].&lt;ref name=voorhees196-237&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorhees|first1=James|title=Dialogue sustained : the multilevel peace process and the Dartmouth Conference|date=2002|publisher=Institute of Peace Press [u.a.]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1929223307|pages=`196–200, 234–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Economic Relations Task Force only met only once, in 1988. One result of the meeting was that American members of the task force were able to contribute to efforts by the Soviets to draft a law on joint ventures.&lt;ref name=voorhees226-227&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorhees|first1=James|title=Dialogue sustained : the multilevel peace process and the Dartmouth Conference|date=2002|publisher=Institute of Peace Press [u.a.]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1929223307|pages=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Africa Task Force addressed issues in the region in 1984, 1985, and 1987, when the region was an area of conflict important enough in the US-Soviet relationship to warrant separate discussions.&lt;ref name=voorhees207-211&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorhees|first1=James|title=Dialogue sustained : the multilevel peace process and the Dartmouth Conference|date=2002|publisher=Institute of Peace Press [u.a.]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1929223307|pages=207–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialogues inspired by the Dartmouth Conference==
Owing largely to the continuing work done by Harold Saunders, the Regional Conflicts Task Force, and the [[Kettering Foundation]], the Dartmouth-inspired model of sustained dialogue was used by groups in several conflicts.

The Regional Conflicts Task Force itself organized the [[Inter-Tajik Dialogue]] with participants from both sides of the conflict in an effort to see whether the Sustained Dialogue framework could be used to design a peace process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Imomov|first1=Ashurboi|last2=Saunders|first2=Harold H.|last3=Chufrin|first3=Gennady|title=The Inter-Tajik Dialogue Within the Framework of the Dartmouth Conference|url=http://www.ca-c.org/dataeng/st_07_imomov.shtml|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The members of the task force ended their direct involvement in 2005, but the dialogue continued for several years under other auspices. It also broadened its activity past discussions among the participants to include creation of an NGO, the Public Committee for Democratic Processes (PCDP) designed to create dialogue about everyday problems at local and regional levels.&lt;ref name=SaundersSustained191-205&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=Harold H.|title=Sustained dialogue in conflicts : transformation and change|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=9780230339804|pages=191–205|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regional Conflicts Task Force continued its experimentation with Sustained Dialogue in the conflicts between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. The group, composed of both Azeris and Armenians met in twelve sessions from October 2001 through Dec 2007.  They developed a framework for a settlement, which has not been adopted by the two governments, but yet remains a part of the political dialogue in the region.&lt;ref name=SaundersSustained135-161&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=Harold H.|title=Sustained dialogue in conflicts : transformation and change|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=9780230339804|pages=135–161|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] created the [[Transnistria]] Conflict Resolution Task Force in partnership with the [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]], the Institute of World Policy in Ukraine, and the [[Institute of World Economy and International Relations]] of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The task force was modeled on Dartmouth. It met four times between 2010 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Rojansky, "Summary of the 4th Meeting of the Transnistria Conflict Resolution Task Force, Odessa, Ukraine, May 26–29, 2013," n.p., n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustained Dialogue Institute==
The [[International Institute for Sustained Dialogue]] (later renamed the Sustained Dialogue Institute) was created in 2002 to continue the work begun by the Regional Conflicts Task Force. It picked up where the task force left off with the [[Inter-Tajik Dialogue]] and the dialogue over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. It also created several dialogues on its own, in the Middle East, Southern Africa, and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;http://sustaineddialogue.org/our-work/international/. Retrieved 14 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It also extended the dialogue to American college campuses through the [[Sustained Dialogue Campus Network]] (SDCN).

==The New Dartmouth==
Early in the new century, the Kettering Foundation tried a different approach to Russian-American dialogue, which was labelled the New Dartmouth. Building on the work it had long done on public deliberation in the United States and used by the [[National Issues Forums]], three groups met to frame the issues in the relationship between the two countries.  Then 25 groups across the country used this framework to discuss the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makarov|first1=Denis V., et al., editors|title=When citizens deliberate : Russian and American citizens consider their relationship|date=2006|publisher=Kettering Foundation Press|location=Dayton, Ohio|isbn=0923993177|pages=1–23|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, two Russian organizations, Russian Center for Citizenship Education and the Foundation for the Development of Civic Culture, conducted 70 similar forums across Russia. They discussed a contrasting framework developed from the American version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makarov|first1=Denis V., et al., editors|title=When citizens deliberate : Russian and American citizens consider their relationship|date=2006|publisher=Kettering Foundation Press|location=Dayton, Ohio|isbn=0923993177|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The results of these public deliberations then formed part of the agenda for the new Dartmouth sessions, held between 2003 and August, 2008 when this work found a new home in Russian libraries and the National Issues Forums network, while larger policy issues were again taken up by the re-focused Task Force on Regional Conflicts.

The '''Dominican Day Parade''' in [[New York City]] is a parade organized by Americans of [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] origin. The event started in 1982 as a local celebration with concerts and cultural events in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] section of [[Manhattan]]. Organized by [[Dominican American]] community leaders, the parade is held annually each August on [[6th Avenue (Manhattan)|6th Avenue]]. Similar parades are also held every year in [[Haverstraw, New York]], [[Paterson, New Jersey]], [[Boston]], and along the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] in [[the Bronx]].

==Parade and Related Events==

The parade is held on [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|6th Avenue]] in [[New York City]].  Marching proceeds from south to north, beginning on 38th Street.  
A gala is held on the second Friday in August before Sunday's parade. Locations of the gala will vary. visit dominicanparade.org for information. A scholarship awards banquet takes place in the fall.

==Mission==
[[File:Dominican people at Dominican parade, New York City.jpg|thumb|right|Dominican Parade, 2014.]]
The newly formed Dominican Day Parade, Inc. is a nonprofit 501 (c) 3, non-partisan organization in formation that organizes the annual parade and festivities.  The organization strives to provide an understanding of the heritage and contributions of the Dominican community in America and throughout the world.   The mission of the Dominican Day Parade, Inc. is to celebrate the richness of the Dominican culture, folklore and popular traditions.

==Themes==

The parade’s theme for 2015 is ''Education and Economic Empowerment''.  The organization recognizes the lack of resources for youth that seek a formal education.  For that reason, Dominican Day Parade, Inc. has set a goal of creating a $250,000 Scholarship Fund.  The fund, the first of its kind in the recent history of the parade, will help pay for education that will, in turn, economically empower young Dominicans throughout the United States.

==Board of directors==

Over the past several years, the leadership of the '''Dominican Day Parade''' had been under scrutiny because the non-profit organization at its helm was not being run according to New York State law.  Under the direction of [[Attorney General]] [[Eric T. Schneiderman]] and [[Mayor Bill de Blasio]], along with other elected officials and community leaders, in 2015, an entirely new entity and [[Board of Directors]] was created for what is now called the '''Dominican Day Parade, Inc.'''  The new members of the board include many distinguished people from the [[Dominican-American]] community, representing a variety of industries and backgrounds.

==Date of Parade==

The '''Dominican Day Parade''' is celebrated on the second Sunday of August to honor the start of the war for the “Second Independence” ([[Dominican Restoration War|La Guerra de la Restauracion]]).  Under the leadership of General [[Gregorio Luperon]], the war was ultimately won from Spain.

In 1844, the [[Dominican Republic]] secured its independence from [[Haiti]] and became a sovereign state until 1861.  Under the leadership of General [[Pedro Santana]], segments of the Dominican population sought to annex the Republic back to [[Spain]] and did so during March 18, 1861.  On August 16, 1863, the start of the war for the Restoration of the Dominican Republic under the command of General Luperon.  The Dominican Republic originally declared its independence from Spain on December 1, 1821.  Ultimately, the [[Dominican Republic]] was re-established, free from [[Spain]], on March 3, 1865.

The '''Duke lacrosse case''' was a widely reported 2006 criminal case in which three members of the [[Duke University]] men's lacrosse team were  [[False accusation of rape|falsely accused of rape]]. The case evoked varied responses from the media, faculty groups, students, the community, and others. The case's resolution sparked public discussion of [[racism]], media bias, and due process on campuses, and ultimately led to the resignation and [[disbarment]] of the lead [[prosecutor]], [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham County]] [[District Attorney]] [[Mike Nifong]].

In March 2006, [[Crystal Mangum|Crystal Gail Mangum]], a black student at [[North Carolina Central University]]&lt;ref name="foxprofile"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crystal Mangum, Stripper Who Falsely Accused Duke Lacrosse Players, Charged with Attempted Murder|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-6219739-504083.html|agency=CBS|accessdate=May 6, 2010|quote=In 2006, Mangum, then a North Carolina Central University student earning money as a stripper, said that three Duke lacrosse players raped her|work=CBS News|first=Neil|last=Katz|date=February 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked as a stripper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/02/18/2010-02-18_crystal_gail_mangum_stripper_in_duke_lacrosse_rape_case_charged_with_arson_and_a.html|title=Crystal Gail Mangum, stripper in Duke lacrosse rape case, charged with arson and attempted murder|work=nydailynews.com|accessdate=September 11, 2010|location=New York|first=Corky|last=Siemaszko|date=February 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; escort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/duke-lacrosse-accuser-crystal-mangums-tragic-life-75197|title=Duke Lacrosse Accuser Crystal Mangum's Tragic Life|date=22 February 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dancer, accused three white Duke University students – all members of the [[Duke Blue Devils men's lacrosse]] team – of [[rape|raping]] her.

In response to the allegations, Duke University suspended the lacrosse team for two games on March 28, 2006. The following week, on April 5, Duke lacrosse coach [[Mike Pressler]] was forced to resign under threat by athletic director [[Joe Alleva]], and Duke [[University president|president]] [[Richard H. Brodhead|Richard Brodhead]] canceled the remainder of the 2006 [[season (sports)|season]].&lt;ref name="Dropping Case"/&gt;

On April 11, 2007, [[North Carolina Attorney General]] [[Roy A. Cooper|Roy Cooper]] dropped all charges and declared the three lacrosse players innocent of the rape allegations. Cooper stated that the players – Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty, and David Evans – were victims of a "tragic rush to accuse".&lt;ref name="Dropping Case"&gt;{{cite news|last=Beard|first=Aaron|title=Prosecutors Drop Charges in Duke Case|agency=Associated Press|date=April 11, 2007|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/n/a/2007/04/11/national/a113721D83.DTL|accessdate=April 11, 2007|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526075138/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F04%2F11%2Fnational%2Fa113721D83.DTL|archivedate=May 26, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial prosecutor, [[Mike Nifong]], was labeled a "rogue prosecutor" by Cooper, and withdrew from the case in January 2007 after the North Carolina State Bar filed ethics charges against him. In June 2007, Nifong was [[disbarment|disbarred]] for "dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation", making him the first prosecutor in North Carolina disbarred for trial conduct. Nifong served one day in jail for lying about sharing DNA tests ([[criminal contempt]]); the lab director said it was a misunderstanding and Nifong claimed it was due to weak memory.&lt;ref name="CrimContempt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Beard|first=Aaron|title=Judge Finds Duke Prosecutor in Contempt|agency=Associated Press|date=August 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mangum faced no charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/06/30/559021/duke-lacrosse-accuser-holds-press.html Duke lacrosse accuser holds press conference to defend herself] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702093826/http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/06/30/559021/duke-lacrosse-accuser-holds-press.html|date=July 2, 2010}}, The News &amp; Observer, June 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper noted several inconsistencies between Mangum's accounts of the evening and Seligmann and Finnerty's [[alibi]] evidence. The Durham Police Department also came under fire for violating their own policies by allowing Nifong to act as the [[de facto]] head of the investigation; using a suspect-only photo identification procedure with Mangum; pursuing the case despite vast discrepancies in notes taken by Investigator Benjamin Himan and Sgt. Mark Gottlieb; and distributing a poster presuming the suspects' guilt shortly after the allegations.&lt;ref name="DurhamLawsuit"/&gt;

In 2007, Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans sought unspecified damages and called for new criminal justice reform laws in a federal civil rights lawsuit against the City of Durham.&lt;ref name="DurhamLawsuit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-players seek $30 million settlement|publisher=News &amp; Observer|date=September 8, 2007|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2007/09/08/45149/ex-players-seek-30-million-settlement.html#storylink=misearch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Mangum claimed that she had only recently taken up stripping, she had actually worked at strip clubs as early as 2002: When she was arrested that year for stealing a taxi and trying to run over a police officer, the incident report stated that she had been lap dancing at a strip club that evening.&lt;ref name="smolkin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smolkin|first=Rachel|authorlink=Rachel Smolkin|date=August–September 2007|title=Justice Delayed|journal=[[American Journalism Review]]|url=http://ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4379|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2006, a party was held at 610 North Buchanan Boulevard, a house owned by Duke University and used as the off-campus residence of the Duke lacrosse team captains. The party was intended as compensation for the team having to remain on campus and miss [[Spring Break]]. The players were consuming alcohol at the party. Several players did not know that strippers were being hired until the players arrived at the party and were asked to contribute to the strippers' fees.&lt;ref name="Parrish"&gt;Parrish, R. B. (2009) ''The Duke Lacrosse Case: A Documentary History and Analysis of the Modern Scottsboro'', p. 19; {{ISBN|1-4392-3590-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team captain contacted Allure, an escort service, and requested two white strippers. However, the two women who arrived, Mangum and Kim Mera Roberts (aka Kim Mera Pittman), were respectively black and biracial (half-black/half-Asian). Before arriving at the party, Mangum, by her own admission, had consumed alcohol and [[Cyclobenzaprine|Flexeril]] (a prescription [[muscle relaxant]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Until Proven Innocent'', pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Mangum and her coworker that day, Roberts, traveled to the party separately. Roberts drove herself and arrived first, and Mangum was later dropped off by a man.&lt;ref name=cohan16&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohan|first=William D.|date=2015|title=The Price of Silence: The Duke Lacrosse Scandal, The Power of the Elite, and the Corruption of Our Great Universities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjbmBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|pages=16–17|isbn=978-1-4516-8179-6|access-date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WhatReallyHappened"&gt;{{cite news|last=Meadows|first=Amy|title=What Really Happened That Night at Duke|publisher=Newsweek|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/35379|date=April 22, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fordhamsummary &gt;{{cite journal|last=Mosteller|first=Robert P.|date=December 2007|title=The Duke Lacrosse Case, Innocence, and False Identifications: A Fundamental Failure to "Do Justice"|url=http://fordhamlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/Vol_76/Mosteller_Vol_76_Dec.pdf|journal=Fordham Law Review|publisher=Fordham Univ.|volume=76|issue=3|pages=1342–45|access-date=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the team captains, one player asked if the strippers had any sex toys, and Roberts responded by asking if the player's penis was too small. The player then brandished a broomstick and suggested that she "use this [as a sex toy]". This exchange of words abruptly stopped the performance, and both strippers shut themselves in the home's bathroom. While the women were still in the bathroom, Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty left the house. The women eventually came out, and Mangum roamed around the yard half-dressed and shouting.&lt;ref name="WhatReallyHappened"/&gt;

According to the accuser, the women were coaxed back into the house with an apology, at which point they were separated. She asserts she was then dragged into a bathroom and raped, beaten, and choked for a half hour.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/second-duke-stripper-offers-account/|title=Second Duke Stripper Offers Account|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, police received a 911 call from a woman complaining that white men gathered outside the home where the party took place had called her racial slurs and threatened to sodomize her with a broomstick.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Some of the party attendees expressed displeasure that the strippers had delivered a very short performance despite being paid several hundred dollars apiece to perform. The team captain who had hired the strippers tried to convince the women to come back into the house and complete the performance. Both women came back into the house, but upon being approached by the player who had earlier held up the broomstick, again refused to perform and locked themselves in the bathroom. By this point, a number of the party guests had left, and the residents of the house, including David Evans, were asking the remaining guests to leave because they were concerned that the noise would cause neighbors to complain to police. When the strippers left the bathroom and the house for the second time, a resident locked the door so they (and the guests who had left the house) could not get back in.&lt;ref name=fordhamsummary/&gt;

Shortly before 1 a.m., Mangum and Roberts entered Roberts's vehicle. Roberts called the partygoers "short dick white boys", and jeered at a player about "how he couldn't get it on his own and had to pay for it",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/11/60minutes/main2082140_page3.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody|title=Duke Rape Suspects Speak Out|last=Schorn|first=Daniel|date=October 11, 2006|work=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS News|page=3|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which one player yelled, "We asked for whites, not niggers." Mangum and Roberts departed in Roberts's car.&lt;ref name="WhatReallyHappened"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/doubts-over-us-college-rape-case/2006/10/20/1160851137762.html|title=Doubts over US college rape case|last=Coultan|first=Mark|date=October 21, 2006|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=September 11, 2010|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts then called 911 and reported that she had just come from 610 North Buchanan and a "white guy" had yelled "nigger" at her from near the East Campus wall. The party ended shortly thereafter and everyone, including the residents, left the house. Police later went to the house as a result of Roberts's complaint, but got no answer at the door; a neighbor confirmed that a party held earlier had ended.&lt;ref name=cohan22&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohan|first=William D.|date=2015|title=The Price of Silence: The Duke Lacrosse Scandal, The Power of the Elite, and the Corruption of Our Great Universities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjbmBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|pages=22–25|isbn=978-1-4516-8179-6|access-date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After departure===
As Roberts drove away with Mangum, the two women began to argue. Roberts stopped the car and attempted to push Mangum out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=2614634&amp;page=1 "'Go Ahead, Put Marks on Me'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127185458/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=2614634&amp;page=1|date=November 27, 2016}}, abcnews.go.com, October 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; When that failed, Roberts drove Mangum to a nearby [[Kroger]] supermarket, went inside, and told a female security guard that a woman was refusing to leave her car. The guard walked to the car and asked Mangum to leave, but Mangum remained in the vehicle. The guard later said she had not smelled alcohol on Mangum's breath, but thought she might have been under the influence of other drugs. At 1:22 AM, the guard called 911 to report that Mangum refused to leave the car. Police then arrived, removed Mangum from the car and questioned her.&lt;ref&gt;Cuomo, Chris &amp; Lara Setrakian,  [http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=1849938&amp;page=1 "Exclusive: Guard Who Saw Alleged Duke Victim Says No Sign or Mention of Rape"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114172220/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=1849938&amp;page=1|date=November 14, 2016}} ''[[ABC News]]'', April 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Mangum had no identification, would not talk to police, was having difficulty walking, and seemed severely impaired, police took her to Durham Center Access, a mental-health and substance-abuse facility, for [[involuntary commitment]]. During the admission process, she claimed that she had been raped prior to her arrival.&lt;ref name=cohan22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Defense motion seeks more reports in Duke lacrosse case", ''The News &amp; Observer'', August 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangum was transferred to [[Duke University Medical Center]]. Examination of her skin, arms, and legs revealed no swelling, no abnormalities, and three small cuts on her right knee and right heel. When asked, she specifically and repeatedly denied receiving any physical blows by hands. Further examination showed no tenderness in the back, chest, and neck.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, R.B. (2009) ''The Duke Lacrosse Case: A Documentary History and Analysis of the Modern Scottsboro'', p. 45; {{ISBN|1-4392-3590-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was diffuse swelling of her vagina. Mangum later claimed that she had performed using a vibrator for a couple in a hotel room shortly before the lacrosse team party. This activity, or a [[yeast infection]], could have caused the swelling. Investigators did not note any other injuries in the rest of the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002981402_dukenight09.html "Piecing together what happened at the Duke lacrosse-team party"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520192134/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002981402_dukenight09.html|date=May 20, 2006}}, ''The Seattle Times'', May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="show gaps"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2006/08/06/44677_lacrosse-files-show-gaps-in-das.html|title=Lacrosse files show gaps in DA's case|publisher=News &amp; Observer|date=August 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defense Sources: Duke Accuser Gave Conflicting Stories About Alleged Rape|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Copsays"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2006/08/27/91873/cop-says-nurse-found-trauma-in.html#storylink=misearch|title=Cop says nurse found trauma in Duke case|publisher=News &amp; Observer|date=August 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Joseph|last=Neff|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2007/04/18/49636/to-the-end-the-account-continues.html#storylink=misearch|title=To the end, the account continues to change|publisher=News &amp; Observer|date=April 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McFadyen e-mail===
A couple of hours after the party ended, Ryan McFadyen, a member of the lacrosse team, sent an e-mail to other players saying that he planned to have some strippers over, kill them, and cut off their skin while wearing his Duke-issue spandex and [[ejaculation|ejaculating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/duke-rape-case-e-mail-shocker|title=Duke Rape Case E-mail Shocker|date=April 5, 2006|publisher=The Smoking Gun|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The e-mail began:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To whom it may concern, tomorrow night, after tonights show, ive decided to have some strippers over to edens 2c. all are welcome.. however there will be no nudity. I plan on killing the bitches as soon as the[y] walk in and proceding {{sic}} to cut their skin off while cumming in my duke issue spandex . . all in besides arch and tack [two of his teammates] please respond&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/society/2014/03/duke-lacrosse-rape-scandal-ryan-mcfadyen Ryan McFadyen e-mail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109192650/http://www.vanityfair.com/society/2014/03/duke-lacrosse-rape-scandal-ryan-mcfadyen|date=January 9, 2015}}, vanityfair.com, March 2014; accessed November 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the players suggested the e-mail was intended as humorous [[irony]]. Administrators asserted the e-mail was an imitation of [[Patrick Bateman]], the [[protagonist]] in the [[Bret Easton Ellis]] novel, ''[[American Psycho]]'', which was read and lectured upon in more than one Duke class, as shown by the e-mail responses from other players. One response read, "I'll bring the Phil Collins," another reference to the ''American Psycho'' book and film. Police released the McFadyen e-mail but refused to release the following e-mail exchanges, leaving the impression that the McFadyen e-mail was actually intended as a serious threat. McFadyen thereafter received a thousand death threats in one week.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, R. B. (2009) ''The Duke Lacrosse Case: A Documentary History and Analysis of the Modern Scottsboro'', pp. 159-61; {{ISBN|1-4392-3590-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The e-mail led many people to assume guilt on the part of the players.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt; McFadyen was not charged with any crime, but he was temporarily suspended from Duke, with the university citing safety concerns. He was invited back to Duke to continue his studies later that summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|date=July 3, 2006|title=Duke's McFadyen reinstated after sending e-mail|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/lacrosse/2006-06-30-duke-mcfadyen_x.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and prosecution==
===Arrests and investigation timeline===
The day after the party, on March 14, 2006, the Durham police began their investigation into the rape allegations by interviewing Mangum and searching 610 North Buchanan pursuant to a warrant. The three team captains who lived at the house, including David Evans, voluntarily gave statements and DNA samples to police and offered to take lie detector tests. The police turned down the offer.&lt;ref name="SelenaR033106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WhatReallyHappened"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cohan63&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohan|first=William D.|date=2015|title=The Price of Silence: The Duke Lacrosse Scandal, The Power of the Elite, and the Corruption of Our Great Universities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjbmBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|pages=63–68|isbn=978-1-4516-8179-6|access-date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2006, the Durham police made their investigation public when Sgt. Mark Gottlieb, the police supervisor, posted on a digital community bulletin board that they were investigating the rape of a young woman by three males at 610 North Buchanan, where she had attended a party in the late evening of March 13, and asking anyone in the area who saw or heard anything unusual to contact Investigator Benjamin Himan.&lt;ref name=cohan63/&gt;

On March 16 and 21, 2006, police showed Mangum [[police lineup|photo arrays]] in an attempt to have her identify her attackers. Each photo array only contained photographs of lacrosse team members, and did not follow the Durham Police Department's recommended policy of including photos of individuals not regarded as potential suspects (known as "fillers"). Mangum identified Reade Seligmann as someone who attended the party, but not as an attacker, and did not identify Evans at all despite seeing his photo twice.&lt;ref name="AGConclusions"&gt;[http://www.ncdoj.gov/getdoc/29748585-538e-43be-9de2-113628743d57/SummaryConclusions.aspx ''Summary of Conclusions''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225602/http://www.ncdoj.gov/getdoc/29748585-538e-43be-9de2-113628743d57/SummaryConclusions.aspx |date=March 3, 2016}}, North Carolina Attorney General's Office &amp; North Carolina Department of Justice, online at ncdoj.gov, accessed May 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2006, Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong received his first briefing on the case from Gottlieb and Himan. Within a few hours of receiving the briefing, Nifong made his first public statement on the case. During the week of March 27, Nifong by his own estimate gave fifty to seventy interviews and devoted more than forty hours to reporters. After that, he continued to make statements, although less frequently. Many of Nifong's statements concerned the team members' alleged failure or refusal to provide information to law enforcement authorities, the team members' invocation of their Constitutional rights, or Nifong's own opinions that a crime had occurred, that it was racially motivated, and that one or more lacrosse players were guilty.&lt;ref name=fordhamnifong1 &gt;{{cite journal|last=Mosteller|first=Robert P.|date=December 2007|title=The Duke Lacrosse Case, Innocence, and False Identifications: A Fundamental Failure to "Do Justice"|url=http://fordhamlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/Vol_76/Mosteller_Vol_76_Dec.pdf|journal=Fordham Law Review|publisher=Fordham Univ.|volume=76|issue=3|pages=1348–51|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2006, Mangum was shown another photo array containing only photos of the 46 white lacrosse team members, including members who had not attended the party, and with no fillers. The photos were shown to Mangum as a [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint presentation]], with each photo projected individually to Mangum, instead of displaying all the pictures arrayed together. For the first time, Mangum identified photos of Seligmann, Evans, and Finnerty as her attackers. She also identified at least one other photo as being a player who was present at the party; further investigation showed he had not been there.&lt;ref name=AGConclusions/&gt;

On April 10, 2006, an attorney retained by one of the lacrosse players stated that time-stamped photographs existed which showed that the woman making the accusations (later identified as Mangum) was already injured when she arrived at the party, and was very impaired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=2403062 "Attorney: Photos will clear Duke lacrosse players"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206060446/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=2403062 |date=February 6, 2016}}, ''[[ESPN]]'', April 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Also on April 10, players' attorneys announced that DNA testing by the North Carolina state crime lab had failed to connect any members of the Duke men's lacrosse team to the alleged rape.&lt;ref name=espn41102&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=2404002 Attorneys: No DNA match in Duke lacrosse case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206052424/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=2404002|date=February 6, 2016}}, ''[[ESPN]]'', April 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2006, Seligmann and Finnerty were [[arrested]] and [[indicted]] on charges of first degree forcible [[rape]], first degree [[sexual offense]] and [[kidnapping]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/duke/ncduke41706ind.html ''North Carolina v.

On May 15, 2006, former team captain and 2006 Duke graduate&lt;ref&gt;Duke's 2006 Commencement had been held on the preceding day, May 14, 2006. Kopty, Yazan, [https://today.duke.edu/2006/05/kopty_speech.html "Transcript of 2006 Graduation Speech" (editor's note)], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828225836/https://today.duke.edu/2006/05/kopty_speech.html|date=August 28, 2016}} ''Duke Today'', May 15, 2006, online at today.duke.edu, accessed May 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Evans became the third player to be indicted on charges of first-degree forcible rape, sexual offense and kidnapping. Just before turning himself in at the Durham County Detention Center, he made a public statement declaring his innocence and his expectation of being cleared of the charges within weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/duke/ncduke41706ind.html Indictments (North Carolina v.

On June 8, 2006, court documents revealed that Roberts, in her initial statement, had said she was with Mangum the entire evening except for a period of less than five minutes. Additionally, after hearing Mangum claim she was sexually assaulted, she called her claims "a crock".&lt;ref&gt;Neff, Joseph. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070420135240/http://www.newsobserver.com/1185/story/448437.html Filing: Second dancer called allegations a 'crock'], ''[[The News &amp; Observer]]''. June 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2006, it was reported that Brian Meehan, director of the private DNA testing lab DSI, had testified that, pursuant to an agreement between himself and Nifong, he had withheld information from DSI's May 12 report, thus producing an incomplete report. Defense attorneys contended that the withheld information was exculpatory evidence.&lt;ref name=yaffe121106/&gt;

On December 22, 2006, Nifong dropped the rape charges against all three lacrosse players after Mangum told an investigator a different version of events and said she was no longer sure about some aspects of her original story. The kidnapping and sexual offense charges were still pending against all three players.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, Aaron, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122200591.html "Duke Lacrosse Case Takes Dramatic Turn"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601033010/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122200591.html|date=June 1, 2016}} WashingtonPost.com, December 23, 2006; accessed May 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 28, 2006, the North Carolina bar filed ethics charges against Nifong over his conduct in the case, accusing him of making public statements that were prejudicial to the administration of justice and heightened public condemnation of the accused, and of engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. The 17-page document accused Nifong of violating four rules of professional conduct, listing more than 100 examples of statements he made to the media.&lt;ref name=fordhamnifong1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wral-tv.com/news/local/story/1120129/ "State Bar Files Ethics Complaint Against Mike Nifong"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111185627/http://www.wral-tv.com/news/local/story/1120129|date=January 11, 2007}}, WRAL.com, December 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 2007, Nifong sent a letter to North Carolina Attorney General [[Roy Cooper]] asking to be taken off the case, citing the responsibility of the case to the Attorney General's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/LegalCenter/story?id=2791514|title=DA in Duke Rape Case Asks to Be Taken off Case|publisher=ABC News|date=January 12, 2007|first=Lara|last=Setrakian|accessdate=April 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, January 13, Cooper announced that his office would take over the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6851890|title=State AG to Take Control of Duke Lacrosse Case|publisher=NPR|date=January 13, 2007|first=Adam|last=Hochberg|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2007, the North Carolina State Bar filed a second round of ethics charges against Nifong for a systematic abuse of prosecutorial discretion that was prejudicial to the administration of justice when he withheld DNA evidence to mislead the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,246281,00.html|title=Former Duke Lacrosse 'Rape' Prosecutor Charged With Withholding Evidence, Misleading Court|publisher=FOXNews.com|date=January 24, 2007|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2007, Justin Paul Caulfield, a legal analyst for the sports magazine ''Inside Lacrosse'', stated on Fox News that the charges against Evans, Finnerty, and Seligmann would soon be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://johnsville.blogspot.com/2007/03/dukenifongcooper69-days-hoax.html|title=Breaking News? No Surprise Here|publisher=The Johnsville News|date=March 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the North Carolina Attorney General's Office first disputed the report, on April 11, 2007, it announced that it had dismissed all charges against the three lacrosse players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charges Dropped In Duke Lacrosse Case|date=April 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper not only dismissed the charges but also took the unusual step of declaring the accused players innocent. Cooper also announced that Mangum would not be prosecuted, stating that investigators and attorneys that had interviewed her thought "she may actually believe the many different stories that she has been telling ... it's in the best interest of justice not to bring charges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/LAW/04/11/cooper.transcript|title=NC attorney general: Duke players "innocent"|publisher=Edition.cnn.com|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2007, the attorney general, in declaring Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans innocent, also called Nifong a "rogue prosecutor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nifong Criticizes AG Cooper In Statement|publisher=Raleigh Chronicle|date=April 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/24/MNGDTN5CEO1.DTL "As Duke rape case unravels, D.A.'s judgment questioned: Defense describes him as willing to skirt law for conviction"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124212418/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F12%2F24%2FMNGDTN5CEO1.DTL|date=January 24, 2008}}, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1459913 "Embattled Nifong Says He will Resign"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530035147/http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1459913|date=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA tests===
Shortly after the party, the prosecution ordered 46 of the 47 lacrosse team members to provide DNA samples, although some members had been absent from the party. The sole black member of the team was exempt because Mangum had stated that her attackers were white. On April 10, 2006, it was announced that DNA testing by the state crime lab had failed to connect any of the 46 tested team members to the alleged rape.&lt;ref name=espn41102/&gt;

After the initial tests by the state crime lab, prosecutor Nifong sought the services of a private laboratory, DNA Security Inc. (aka DSI) of [[Burlington, North Carolina]], to conduct additional tests. DNA from multiple unidentified males was found inside Mangum and upon the rape kit items that had been tested, but none matched any of the lacrosse players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Laura|last=Parker|title=Disbarment may not be end for Nifong|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-06-17-nifong_N.htm?csp=34|publisher=USA Today|date=June 19, 2007|accessdate=October 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nifong falsely represented to the court and the public that DNA had only been found from a single male source, Mangum's boyfriend.&lt;ref name="2nd_DNA_Test"&gt;{{cite news|first=Aaron|last=Beard|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/lacrosse/2006-05-12-duke-lacrosse-dna_x.htm|title=Defense attorney: 2nd DNA test shows no conclusive match|agency=Associated Press|date=May 12, 2006|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duke Lacrosse Player: 'I'm Absolutely Innocent'|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=May 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a motion made on December 15, 2006, defense attorneys argued that the DNA analysis report written by DSI and provided to them by Nifong's office was incomplete, because it omitted information showing that none of the genetic material from several men found on Mangum matched any DNA sample from the lacrosse team. Brian Meehan, the director of DSI who wrote the misleading report, testified that his lab did not try to withhold information, but acknowledged that the decision not to release the full report violated the lab's policies. Meehan testified that after discussions with Nifong, he decided to withhold the names of the persons excluded by the DNA testing (all 46 tested members of the lacrosse team) to protect the privacy of players not implicated in the case, despite the fact that two players (Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty) had already been indicted for rape more than three weeks prior to the release date of the report.&lt;ref name=yaffe121106/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paternity"&gt;[http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1107841 "Paternity Test Ordered in Duke Lacrosse Rape Case"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217134251/http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1107841|date=December 17, 2006}}, WRAL.com, December 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Meehan was later fired in October 2007 based on this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waggoner|first1=Martha|title=Appeals court finds firing OK in Duke lacrosse case|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/08/03/1386821/appeals-court-finds-firing-ok.html|accessdate=February 19, 2015|work=The News &amp; Observer|date=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA was also taken from all surfaces of three of Mangum's false fingernails retrieved from the trash in the party house bathroom (widely but inaccurately reported as DNA taken only from the "underside" of a single fingernail). According to DNA Security, the fingernail DNA showed some characteristics similar to lacrosse player David Evans's DNA. However, the match was not conclusive, as 2% of the male population (including Evans) could not be excluded based on the sample.&lt;ref name="Taylor&amp;Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/penguinslive/s_453128.html "Report: DNA link possible for third Duke player"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121222533/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/penguinslive/s_453128.html|date=November 21, 2007}}, ''[[Associated Press]] and the [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' May 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, because Evans lived in the house, defense attorneys contended that any DNA present might have come from the tissue paper, cotton swabs, or other hygiene-related trash that had been in the garbage can along with the fingernail. This was confirmed later by Attorney General Cooper's investigation: "to the extent that Evans's DNA could not be excluded, the SBI experts confirmed that the DNA could easily have been transferred to the fingernails from other materials in the trash can".&lt;ref name="AGConclusions"/&gt;

Nifong contended that lack of DNA evidence is not unusual and that 75–80% of all [[sexual assault]] cases lack DNA evidence. Rape victims often delay reporting by days or weeks, inadvertently destroying DNA evidence. However, in this case, Mangum had a rape-kit exam administered only hours after the end of the party, so the absence of DNA evidence was considered unlikely by legal experts.&lt;ref&gt;Spilbor, Jonna. [http://writ.news.findlaw.com/commentary/20060414_spilbor.html "The Rape That Never Was: Why, In Light Of The Lack Of DNA Evidence, The Case Against Duke's Lacrosse Team Should Be Dropped"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429002936/http://writ.news.findlaw.com/commentary/20060414_spilbor.html|date=April 29, 2016}}, FindLaw.com, April 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Nifong's subsequent ethics trial on June 14, 2007, the complete DNA findings were revealed during defense attorney Brad Bannon's testimony. According to conservative estimates, the lab had discovered at least two unidentified males' DNA in Mangum's pubic region; at least two unidentified males' DNA in her rectum; at least four to five unidentified males' DNA on her underpants; and at least one identified male's DNA in her vagina.&lt;ref name="Y-Str"&gt;[http://bp1.blogger.com/_k_8jgSqqBEw/RnG7LUtFURI/AAAAAAAAAAU/nPzwO3xy2QI/s1600-h/Rape+Kit+Spreadsheet-001.jpg Y-Str (Male) DNA Characteristics Discovered by DNA Security on the Rape Kit Items] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222358/http://bp1.blogger.com/_k_8jgSqqBEw/RnG7LUtFURI/AAAAAAAAAAU/nPzwO3xy2QI/s1600-h/Rape+Kit+Spreadsheet-001.jpg|date=March 3, 2016}}; retrieved June 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collin Finnerty previous incident===
In November 2005, Finnerty and two of his [[Chaminade High School]] lacrosse teammates had previously been charged with misdemeanor simple assault in [[Washington, D.C.]], following an altercation with a Washington man outside a [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] bar.&lt;ref name=nytmacur&gt;Macur, Juliet.

Although the man alleged that Finnerty had pushed and threatened him, the man was actually punched by a third party (a friend of Finnerty), who admitted to the punch.&lt;ref name=cbsfinnerty&gt;Striker, Clarissa.

Finnerty was initially accepted into a diversion program for first offenders, allowing for the simple assault charge to be dismissed upon his completion of community service.&lt;ref name=nytmacur/&gt;

However, after the Durham charges appeared, the Washington, D.C. prosecutor cancelled his diversion agreement and proceeded with the assault charge. At trial, the chief defense witness was not permitted to testify and police officers presented details which were not in their notes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Finnerty was convicted and sentenced to six months' probation.&lt;ref Judge John H. Bayly with confinement – once, after an anonymous e-mail falsely accused him of violating an order preventing him from being in Georgetown; and again after he was absent from home and missed an obligatory curfew, in order to be in Durham to work on his defense there, an absence which he had previously cleared with the court's own supervising agency. Some observers {{Who|date=September 2018}} noted the similarity of this treatment with previous attempts by the government to pressure witnesses to testify in a certain manner.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, R.B. (2009) ''The Duke Lacrosse Case: A Documentary History and Analysis of the Modern Scottsboro'', pp. 162-70; {{ISBN|1-4392-3590-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 28, 2006, shortly after the Durham rape charges against Finnerty were dropped, Judge Bayly ended Finnerty's probation.

In January 2007, Finnerty's assault conviction was vacated (by an order signed by Bayly) and his record was cleared.&lt;ref name=fincleared/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallia, Joseph, and Melanie Lefkowitz.

==Defense and media questioning==
===Credibility of Crystal Mangum as accuser===
====Possible intoxication and mental state====
Lawyers for the Duke lacrosse players have said that Mangum was intoxicated with alcohol and possibly other drugs on the night of the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1859737&amp;page=1 "Alleged Duke Rape Victim Wants Her Life Back"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202354/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1859737&amp;page=1|date=March 3, 2016}}, ''[[ABC News]]'', April 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By the accuser's own admission to police, she had taken prescription [[Cyclobenzaprine|Flexeril]] and drunk "one or two large-size beers" before she went to the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1092027 "Report: Police Notes Bolster Prosecution Of Duke Lacrosse Case"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530035118/http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1092027|date=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Attorney General's office later noted that Mangum had taken [[Ambien]], [[methadone]], [[Paxil]], and [[amitriptyline]], although when she began taking these medications is uncertain.&lt;ref name="AGConclusions"/&gt; She has a long history of mental problems and suffers from [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name="conflict"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jarvis, Craig|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2007/04/13/44070/mangums-life-conflict-contradictions.html|title=Mangum's life: conflict, contradictions|publisher=News and Observer|date=April 13, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117162251/http://www.newsobserver.com/2007/04/13/44070/mangums-life-conflict-contradictions.html|archivedate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inconsistencies in Mangum's story====
Over the course of the scandal, police reports, media investigations, and defense attorneys' motions and press conferences brought to light several key inconsistencies in Mangum's story.&lt;ref name="conflict"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dancer_gives_details"&gt;Khanna, Samiha &amp; Anne Blythe. [http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/421799.html "Dancer gives details of ordeal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427054608/http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/421799.html|date=April 27, 2006}}, ''[[The News &amp; Observer]]'', March 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the questions about her credibility were:
* Durham police said that Mangum kept changing her story and was not credible, reporting that she initially told them she was raped by 20 white men, later reducing the number to only three.
* Another police report states that Mangum initially claimed she was only groped, rather than raped, but changed her story before going to the hospital.
* On December 22, 2006, Nifong dropped the rape charges after Mangum stated that she was penetrated from behind but that she did not know with what. In North Carolina, penetration with an object is considered sexual assault, not rape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/22/sports/22cnd-duke.html?ex=1324443600&amp;en=663f0920072de97f&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss "Rape Charges Dropped in Duke Case"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328010309/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/22/sports/22cnd-duke.html?ex=1324443600&amp;en=663f0920072de97f&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|date=March 28, 2016}}, ''The New York Times'', December 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 11, 2007, several more inconsistencies came to light after the defense filed a motion detailing her interview on December 21, 2006. For example, she changed details about when she was attacked, who attacked her, and how they attacked her:&lt;ref name="ChangeAgain"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2007/01/12/89217/duke-attack-story-shifts.html#storylink=misearch|title=Duke attack story shifts|publisher=News &amp; Observer|date=January 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WRALChangeAgain"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wral.com/news/local/story/1133573|title=Lacrosse Defense: Accuser's Story Changes Again|date=January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In the new version from the December 21 interview, Mangum claims she was attacked from 11:35&amp;nbsp;p.m. to midnight, much earlier than her previous accusations. This new timing is before the well-documented alibi evidence for Reade Seligmann that places him away from the house. However, the defense revealed that this new timing would suggest Seligmann was on the phone with his girlfriend during the height of the attack. Additionally, she received an incoming call at 11:36&amp;nbsp;p.m. and somebody stayed on the line for 3 minutes, which would be during the party according to the new timetable.
** The new statement contradicts time-stamped photos that show her dancing between 12:00 and 12:04&amp;nbsp;a.m. It would also mean that they stayed at the party for nearly an hour after the supposed attack since Kim Roberts drove her away at 12:53&amp;nbsp;a.m. In her April statement, Mangum said they left immediately after the attack.
** Mangum changed the names of her attackers, claiming they had used multiple [[pseudonyms]].
** The accuser also changed her description of Evans. She previously claimed that she was attacked by a man that looked like Evans except with a mustache, but later stated that the assailant just had a five o'clock shadow.
** Mangum claimed that Evans stood in front of her, making her perform oral sex on him. Previously, she stated that Seligmann did this. In the latest statement, she stated that Seligmann did not commit any sex act on her and that he had said that he could not participate because he was getting married. Although he has a girlfriend, there has never been anything to suggest he was engaged or getting married.
* North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper said Mangum told many different accounts of the attack. In one account, she claimed she was suspended in mid-air and was being assaulted by all three of them in the bathroom. Cooper then said this event seemed very implausible because of the small size of the bathroom. According to a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' investigation, Mangum gave at least a dozen different stories.
* In its own investigation, ''[[The News &amp; Observer]]'', North Carolina's second largest newspaper, determined that Mangum gave at least five different versions of the incident to police and medical interviewers by August 2006.&lt;ref name="show gaps"/&gt;
* Mangum, at one point, claimed both Evans and Finnerty helped her into her car upon departure. However, a photo shows her being helped by another player, while electronic records and witnesses reported that Evans and Finnerty had already left. Upon seeing the photo, Mangum claimed that it must have been doctored or that Duke University paid someone off.&lt;ref name="The Duke Case"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/11/60minutes/main2673456_page2.shtml "The Duke Case: Innocent"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024064301/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/11/60minutes/main2673456_page2.shtml|date=October 24, 2012}}, cbsnews.com, April 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mangum did not consistently choose the same three defendants in the photo lineups. Media reports have disclosed at least two photo lineups that occurred in March and April in which she was asked to recall who she saw at the party and in what capacity. In the March lineup, she did not choose Dave Evans at all. There was only one individual she identified as being at the party with 100% certainty during both procedures – Brad Ross.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/images/wtvd/pdf/suppression_2.pdf Suppression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204617/http://abclocal.go.com/images/wtvd/pdf/suppression_2.pdf|date=March 3, 2016}}, abclocal.go.com; retrieved June 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=I don't know what this source is, but it's definitely *not* a page from ABClocal.go.com, which hosted local ABC TV news coverage.|date=July 2017}} After being identified, Ross provided to police investigators indisputable evidence that he was with his girlfriend at [[North Carolina State University]] before, during, and after the party through cell phone records as well as an [[affidavit]] from a witness.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{Better source|reason=I don't know what this source is, but it's definitely *not* a page from ABClocal.go.com, which hosted local ABC TV news coverage.|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohan|first1=William D.|title=The price of silence: The Duke lacrosse scandal, the power of the elite, and the corruption of our great universities|date=2014|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=9781451681802|pages=67, 116–117, 190–192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjbmBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q=Ross%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other credibility issues====
The Duke defense lawyers or media reports have indicated:
* The second stripper who performed at the house, Kim Roberts, said that Mangum was not raped. She stated that Mangum was not obviously hurt. Likewise, she refuted other aspects of Mangum's story including denying that she helped dress Mangum after the party and saying that they were not forcefully separated by players as Mangum had reported.&lt;ref name="Kim Roberts"&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/15238767 "Duke accuser lying, second stripper says"], msnbc.com, October 13, 2006. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014043420/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/15238767|date=October 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* DNA results revealed that the woman had sex with a man who was not a Duke lacrosse player. Attorney Joseph Cheshire said the tests indicated DNA from a single male source came from a vaginal swab taken from Mangum. Media outlets reported that this DNA was from her boyfriend.&lt;ref name="2nd_DNA_Test"/&gt;

However, it was later revealed that DNA from multiple males who were neither the lacrosse players nor Mangum's boyfriend had been found, but that these findings had been deliberately withheld from the Court and the defense.&lt;ref&gt;Tad Nelson, [http://tadnelsonlaw.com/duke-lacrosse-case "Duke Lacrosse Debacle and Accuser’s Credibility"], FoxNews, January 14, 2007.&lt;br&gt; {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141122041451/http://tadnelsonlaw.com/duke-lacrosse-case|date=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* She had made a similar claim in the past which she did not pursue. On August 18, 1996, the dancer – then 18 years old – told a police officer in Creedmoor she had been raped by three men in June 1993, according to a police document. The officer who took the woman's report at that time asked her to write a detailed timeline of the night's events and bring the account back to the police, but she never returned.&lt;ref name="similar claim"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2006/11/14/44919/event-told-of-accuser-in-lacrosse.html|title=Event told of accuser in lacrosse rape case|publisher=News &amp; Observer|date=November 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="60 minutes"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/11/60minutes/main2082140.shtml?CMP=ILC-SearchStories Duke Rape Suspects Speak Out] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021051448/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/11/60minutes/main2082140.shtml?CMP=ILC-SearchStories|date=October 21, 2012}}. ''[[60 Minutes]]'', October 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The strip club's security officer said that Mangum told co-workers four days after the party that she was going to get money from some boys at a Duke party who had not paid her, mentioning that the boys were white. The security guard did not make a big deal of it because he felt that no one took her seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2006/11/04/97066/accuser-in-duke-lacrosse-case.html#storylink=misearch|title=Accuser in Duke lacrosse case wanted money, man says|publisher=newsobserver.com|date=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Mangum was arrested in 2002 for stealing a cab from a strip club where she had been working.

===Durham Police Department's actions===
Lawyers and media have questioned the methods of the photo identification process, and have argued that the police supervisor in the case, Sgt. Mark Gottlieb, has unfairly targeted Duke students in the past.&lt;ref name="got tough"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2006/09/09/69130/detective-got-tough-with-duke.html#storylink=misearch|title=Detective got tough with Duke students|publisher=News &amp; Observer|date=September 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Photo identification====
Lawyers and media reports alike suggested the photo identification process was severely flawed. During the photo identifications, Mangum was told that she would be viewing Duke University lacrosse players who attended the party, and was asked if she remembered seeing them at the party and in what capacity. Defense attorneys claimed this was essentially a "multiple-choice test in which there were no wrong answers",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1107415/ "Duke Lacrosse Defense Wants Photo IDs Thrown Out"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005065128/http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1107415|date=October 5, 2015}}, WRAL.com, December 14, 2006; retrieved September 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; while Duke law professor [[James Earl Coleman Jr.]] posits that "[t]he officer was telling the witness that all are suspects, and say, in effect, 'Pick three.'

[[U.S. Department of Justice]] guidelines suggest including at least five non-suspect filler photos for each suspect included,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/25/us/25duke.html Wilson, Duff &amp; Glater, Jonathan D.

Ross (the only player she identified as attending the party with 100% certainty during both procedures) provided police investigators with evidence that he was with his girlfriend at [[North Carolina State University]] before, during, and after the party through cell phone records and an affidavit from a witness. Another person whom the accuser had identified in April also provided police with evidence that he did not attend the party at all. In regards to Seligmann's identification, Mangum's confidence increased from 70% in March to 100% in April. Gary Wells — an [[Iowa State University]] professor and expert on police identification procedures — has asserted that memory does not improve  with time.&lt;ref name="conflictingID"&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/content/news/crime_safety/duke_lacrosse/story_graphics/20061008_dukelax.pdf Conflicting Identifications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002032023/http://www.newsobserver.com/content/news/crime_safety/duke_lacrosse/story_graphics/20061008_dukelax.pdf|date=October 2, 2008}}. ''The News &amp; Observer''; retrieved December 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the transcript of the photo identification released on ''[[The Abrams Report]]'', Mangum also stated that David Evans had a mustache on the night of the attack. Evans's lawyer stated that his client has never had a mustache and that photos as well as eyewitness testimony would reveal that Evans has never had a mustache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3rd Duke lacrosse player: all 'fantastic lies'|agency=Associated Press|date=May 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accusations of intimidation tactics====
Defense lawyers suggested police used intimidation tactics on witnesses. On May 11, Moezeldin Elmostafa, an immigrant taxi driver who signed a sworn statement about Seligmann's whereabouts that defense lawyers say provides a solid alibi, was arrested on a 2½-year-old shoplifting charge. Arresting officers first asked if he had anything new to say about the lacrosse case. When he refused to alter his testimony, he was taken into custody. An arrest and conviction would have destroyed his chance for citizenship and could have led to his deportation. Elmostafa was subsequently tried on the shoplifting charge and acquitted, after a grainy security tape proved that a security guard who was the prosecution's chief witness had "misremembered" events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2006/08/30/38843/cabbie-in-lacrosse-case-acquitted.html#storylink=misearch|title=Cabbie in lacrosse case acquitted in shoplifting|publisher=News &amp; Observer|date=August 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, R. B. (2009) ''The Duke Lacrosse Case: A Documentary History and Analysis of the Modern Scottsboro'', pp. 157-58; {{ISBN|1-4392-3590-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police also arrested Mangum's former husband, Kenneth McNeil; her boyfriend, Matthew Murchison; and another friend, with the disposition of their own separate cases entirely in the hands of District Attorney Nifong. The daughter of Durham's police chief was arrested on an old warrant, and the chief himself remained absent from duty and invisible to the press for most of the case.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, R. B. (2009) ''The Duke Lacrosse Case: A Documentary History and Analysis of the Modern Scottsboro'', pp. 175-76; {{ISBN|1-4392-3590-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Supervisor====
''The News &amp; Observer'' suggested that the supervisor of the lacrosse investigation, Sgt. Mark Gottlieb, had unfairly targeted Duke students in the past, putting some of his investigational tactics into question. Gottlieb has made a disproportionate number of arrests of Duke students for misdemeanor violations, such as carrying an open container of alcohol. Normally, these violations earn offenders a pink ticket similar to a traffic ticket.

From May 2005 to February 2006, when Sgt. Gottlieb was a patrol officer in District 2, he made 28 total arrests. Twenty of those arrests were Duke students, and at least 15 were handcuffed and taken to jail. This is in stark contrast to the other two officers on duty in the same district during that same 10-month period. They made 64 total arrests, only two of which were Duke students. Similarly, ''The News &amp; Observer'' charges that Gottlieb treated nonstudents very differently. For example, he wrote up a young man for illegally carrying a concealed .45-caliber handgun and possession of [[marijuana]] (crimes far more severe than the Duke students who were taken to jail committed), but did not take him to jail. Residents complimented Gottlieb for dealing fairly with loud parties and disorderly conduct by students.&lt;ref name="got tough"/&gt;

Duke's student newspaper, ''The Chronicle,'' depicted other examples of violence and dishonesty from Sgt. Gottlieb. It published that one student threw a party at his rental home off-East Campus before [[the Rolling Stones]] concert in October 2005. The morning after the concert, at 3 A.M., Sgt. Gottlieb led a raid on the home with nine other officers while the students were half asleep. It reported that one student was dragged out of bed and then dragged down the stairs. It reported that all seven housemates were put in handcuffs, arrested, and taken into custody for violating a noise ordinance and open container of alcohol violations. Sgt. Gottlieb reportedly told one student, an American citizen of [[Serbia]]n descent, that the student could be deported. Other stories include the throwing of a 130&amp;nbsp;pound male against his car for an open container of alcohol violation, refusing the ID of a student since he was international, searching through a purse without a warrant, refusing to tell a student her rights, and accusations of [[perjury]].&lt;ref name="Chron"&gt;Mueller, Jared.

===Prosecutor Nifong's actions===
====Possible political motivation====
At the time the rape allegations were made in March 2006, Mike Nifong was in the midst of a difficult [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[primary election]] campaign to keep his position as Durham County District Attorney, facing strong opposition. It was understood that if Nifong lost the primary, he would very likely lose his job. Some commentators have opined that Nifong's prosecution of the Duke lacrosse players and his many statements to the media were driven by his political strategy to attract African-American voters. The primary was held on May 6, 2006, and Nifong won by a slim margin of 883 votes. Results showed Nifong won the primary on the basis of strong support from the black community. Nifong went on to win the [[general election]] in November 2006, although by a lower margin than usual for Democratic candidates in Durham County at that time.&lt;ref name=fordhamnifong2 &gt;{{cite journal|last=Mosteller|first=Robert P.|date=December 2007|title=The Duke Lacrosse Case, Innocence, and False Identifications: A Fundamental Failure to "Do Justice"|url=http://fordhamlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/Vol_76/Mosteller_Vol_76_Dec.pdf|journal=Fordham Law Review|publisher=Fordham Univ.|volume=76|issue=3|pages=1354–57|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prosecution's chief investigator====
Nifong hired Linwood E. Wilson as his chief investigator. During Wilson's private detective career, at least seven formal inquiries into his conduct were performed. In 1997, Wilson was reprimanded by the state commission. After his appeal of the decision was rejected, he allowed his detective license to expire. In response to criticism, Wilson stated that no one had ever questioned his integrity. On June 25, 2007, shortly after Nifong's disbarment and removal from office, it was reported that Nifong's replacement, interim district attorney Jim Hardin Jr., fired Wilson from his post.&lt;ref name="linwood fired"&gt;{{cite news|title=Durham DA's investigator jobless|publisher=News &amp; Observer|date=June 26, 2007|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2007/06/26/44935/durham-das-investigator-jobless.html|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media policies regarding identity revelation of accusers and accused===
[[Fox News]] was the sole national [[television]] news outlet to reveal Mangum's photo following the dismissal of the case, although [[MSNBC]] and ''[[60 Minutes]]'' revealed her name.&lt;ref name="foxprofile"/&gt; Several major broadcasters did not publish Mangum's name at any point, including [[ABC News|ABC]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], [[CNN]], and [[NBC News|NBC]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

====Publication of Mangum's identity====
Partially obscured photos of Mangum at the party were broadcast by ''[[The Abrams Report]]'' on cable news channel [[MSNBC]] and by local television affiliate [[NBC]] 17 [[WNCN]] in North Carolina. On April 21, 2006, outspoken talk-radio host [[Tom Leykis]] disclosed Mangum's name during his nationally syndicated talk-radio program. Leykis has disclosed identities of accusers of [[sexual assault]] in the past. On May 15, 2006, MSNBC host [[Tucker Carlson]] disclosed Mangum's first name only on his show, ''[[Tucker (television program)|Tucker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12817650 Tucker] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018142830/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12817650 |date=October 18, 2012}}, ''[[MSNBC]]'', May 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Court records presented by the defense revealed Mangum's name.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Effect on community relations===
The allegations have inflamed already strained relations between Duke University and its host city of Durham, with members of the Duke lacrosse team being vilified in the press and defamed on and off campus. On May 1, 2006, the [[New Black Panthers]] held a protest outside Duke University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2006/04/29/55639/duke-we-will-not-let-the-safety.html#storylink=misearch|title=Duke: 'We will not let the safety...be jeopardized'|publisher=News &amp; Observer|date=April 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case drew national attention and highlighted [[race relations|racial tensions]] within the Durham area.&lt;ref name="Charges to be dropped soon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: All Charges Against Duke Lacrosse Players to Be Dropped Soon|publisher=FoxNews|date=March 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jesse Jackson and Rainbow/Push Involvement===
In 2006, [[Jesse Jackson]] promised the [[Rainbow/Push Coalition]] would pay the college tuition for Mangum.

{{Wikinews|US prosecutor Mike Nifong to be disbarred for ethics violations}}
On June 16, 2007, the North Carolina State Bar ordered Nifong [[Disbarment|disbarred]] after the bar's three-member disciplinary panel unanimously found him guilty of [[fraud]], [[dishonesty]], [[Lie|deceit]] or [[misrepresentation]]; of [[making false statements]] of material fact before a judge; of making false statements of material fact before bar investigators, and of lying about withholding exculpatory DNA evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Setrakian|first1=Lara|last2=Francescani|first2=Chris|date=June 16, 2007|title=Former Duke Prosecutor Nifong Disbarred|url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3285862&amp;page=1|newspaper=ABC News|location=Raleigh, N.C.|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the state bar's announcement, Nifong submitted a letter of resignation from his post as Durham County district attorney, that would have become effective in July 2007. However, on June 18, Durham Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson ordered that Nifong be immediately removed from office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1509633 "Judge Suspends Resigned Nifong From DA's Office"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405100402/http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1509633|date=April 5, 2016}}, wral.com, June 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, 2007, Nifong was held in criminal contempt of court for knowingly making false statements to the court during the criminal proceedings. Durham Superior Court Judge W. Osmond Smith III sentenced Nifong to one day in jail, which he subsequently served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1763323|title=Nifong Guilty of Criminal Contempt; Sentenced to 1 Day in Jail|date=August 31, 2007|work=WRAL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Mangum===

On December 15, 2006, it was reported that Mangum was pregnant and the judge in the case ordered a paternity test.&lt;ref name="Paternity"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/11/60minutes/main2082140.shtml CBS's ''60 Minutes'' segment "Duke Rape Suspects Speak Out"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006065416/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/11/60minutes/main2082140.shtml|date=6 October 2013}}, cbsnews.com, October 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rightsideoftheroad.com/?p=401 "Who is the real victim in the Duke lacrosse case?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505185739/http://www.rightsideoftheroad.com/?p=401|date=May 5, 2007}}, rightsideoftheroad.com, January 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, Mangum graduated from [[North Carolina Central University]] with a degree in police psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.dukechronicle.com/media/storage/paper884/news/2008/05/15/Columns/Summa.Cum.Loony-3371900.shtml "Summa cum loony"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519112050/http://media.www.dukechronicle.com/media/storage/paper884/news/2008/05/15/Columns/Summa.Cum.Loony-3371900.shtml|date=May 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2008, a press release announced the planned publication in October 2008 of a memoir by Mangum, ''The Last Dance for Grace: The Crystal Mangum Story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6343080|title=Duke LAX accuser pens memoir - 8/22/08-Raleigh News-abc11.com|publisher=Abclocal.go.com|date=August 22, 2008|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The press release indicated the book "can't and doesn't deal with the complex legal aspects of the case" but that "the muddling of facts about Crystal's life, along with North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper's desire to settle the dispute over open file discovery, swallowed the case whole". Defense attorney Joseph Cheshire responded to the news by saying that if the book was truthful, "I think it would be fabulous, and I don't think anybody would think badly about her in any way, shape or form", but that if the memoir did not acknowledge the falsity of her allegations against the players, that he would advise them to initiate civil action against her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/3421612 "Duke lacrosse attorney hopes accuser admits she lied"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828043730/http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/3421612|date=August 28, 2016}}, wral.com; retrieved September 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Her book was published later that year.

On June 18, 2007, Duke University announced that it had reached a settlement with Seligmann, Finnerty and Evans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2007/06/settlement.html|title=Duke University, Three Lacrosse Players Announce Settlement|accessdate=May 11, 2015|publisher=[[Duke University]]|date=June 18, 2007|author=Duke Univ.

In January 2007, lacrosse team member Kyle Dowd filed a lawsuit against Duke University and against a visiting associate professor and member of the [[Group of 88]], [[Kim Curtis]], claiming he and another teammate were given failing grades on their final paper as a form of retaliation after the scandal broke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke Civil Lawsuit|url=http://abclocal.go.com/images/wtvd/pdf/dukecivillawsuit.pdf|publisher=ABC News|format=PDF|date=April 11, 2007|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAX Player Lawsuit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=triangle&amp;id=4905060|title=LAX Player Files Lawsuit Against Duke University|date=January 4, 2007|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=January 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was settled with the terms undisclosed except that Dowd's grade was altered to a P (for "Pass").&lt;ref name="Settlement of Dowd Case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/573369.html|title=Faculty revisits case, Nifong|date=May 12, 2007|publisher=The News&amp;Observer|accessdate=May 12, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922121028/http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/573369.html|archivedate=September 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Houston Baker]], who continued to accuse Dowd and the others of being "hooligans, rapists", called Dowd's mother "the mother of a farm animal", after she e-mailed him. Duke Provost Peter Lange responded to Baker, criticizing Baker for prejudging the team based on race and gender, citing this as a classic tactic of racism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Applebome]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/nyregion/15towns.html "After Duke Prosecution Began to Collapse, Demonizing Continued"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121090451/http://select.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/nyregion/15towns.html|date=January 21, 2016}}, ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke's Athletic Director at the time, [[Joe Alleva]], who forced lacrosse coach [[Mike Pressler]]'s resignation, faced criticism for his handling of this case. In 2008, Alleva announced he was leaving Duke for the Athletic Director position at [[Louisiana State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2008/04/15/allevas-tenure-saw-dukes-best-and-worst "Alleva's tenure saw Duke's best and worst"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327182516/http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2008/04/15/allevas-tenure-saw-dukes-best-and-worst|date=27 March 2015 }}, ''Duke Chronicle'', April 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The lacrosse team, reinstated for the 2007 season, reached the [[2007 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Finals]] as the #1 seed.

On June 7, 2007, it was announced that lacrosse coach Mike Pressler and Duke had reached a financial settlement. Pressler was later hired as coach by Division II (now Division I) [[Bryant University]] in Rhode Island. In October 2007, Pressler filed suit seeking to undo the settlement and hold a trial on his wrongful termination claim on the grounds that Duke spokesman John Burness had made disparaging comments about him. After Duke failed in an attempt to have the case dismissed, the matter was settled in 2010 with Duke apologizing in a press release but refusing to comment regarding any compensation to Pressler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukechronicle.com/article/duke-settles-former-lacrosse-coach-pressler Duke settles with former lacrosse coach Pressler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609223127/http://dukechronicle.com/article/duke-settles-former-lacrosse-coach-pressler|date=June 9, 2016 }}, TheChronicle.com; accessed November 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
On September 7, 2007, it was reported that the three accused players (Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans), who had already settled with Duke University, planned to file a lawsuit for violations of their civil rights against the city of Durham and several city employees, unless the city agreed to a settlement including payment of $30 million over five years and the passage of new criminal justice reform laws. The city's liability insurance covers up to $5 million.&lt;ref name="DurhamLawsuit"/&gt;

Lawyers cited three main areas of vulnerability for the city:
* The suspect-only photo identification procedure given to Mangum.
* Vast discrepancies in notes taken by Investigator Benjamin Himan during his March interview with Mangum and Sgt. Gottlieb's notes in July
* The release of a [[CrimeStoppers]] poster by the police shortly after the allegations that a woman "was sodomized, raped, assaulted and robbed. This horrific crime sent shock waves throughout our community."&lt;ref name="DurhamLawsuit"/&gt;

Durham declined the settlement offer and on October 5, 2007, the three accused players filed a federal lawsuit alleging a broad conspiracy to frame them. Named in the suit were Nifong, the lab that handled the DNA work, the city of Durham, the city's former police chief, the deputy police chief, the two police detectives who handled the case and five other police department employees. The players are seeking unspecified damages, and also want to place the Durham Police Department under court supervision for 10 years, claiming the actions of the police department pose "a substantial risk of irreparable injury to other persons in the City of Durham". According to the suit, Nifong engineered the conspiracy to help him win support for his election bid. Nifong reportedly told his campaign manager that the case would provide "'millions of dollars' in free advertising".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/content/media/2007/10/5/20071005_laxlawsuit.pdf|title=Copy of lawsuit|format=PDF|accessdate=April 16, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327105944/http://www.newsobserver.com/content/media/2007/10/5/20071005_laxlawsuit.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2008, the city of Durham filed a motion to remove itself as a defendant, arguing it had no responsibility for Nifong's actions. On the same day, Nifong filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2008/01/16/91745/nifong-files-for-bankruptcy-city.html#storylink=misearch|title=Nifong files for bankruptcy; city replies to suit|date=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 27, 2008, Judge William L.

On March 31, 2011, Judge James Beaty issued a ruling on the ''Evans et al.'' case, upholding claims against Nifong and his hired investigator Wilson for conspiracy to commit malicious prosecution in the course of their investigation; the city of Durham for negligence; Nifong, Wilson, and police investigators Gottlieb and Himan for malicious prosecution, concealment of evidence, and fabrication of false evidence. However, the players' civil rights claims, which constituted the bulk of their Complaint, were dismissed on the grounds that the applicable civil rights laws pertained only to persons of African-American descent.&lt;ref&gt;Judge James Beaty, Memorandum Opinion, March 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=May 2017}}{{dubious|Dubious claim|reason=the civil rights statutes cited in their suit are not limited in their protection to African Americans|date=May 2017}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Plaintiffs contend that they have alleged race discrimination as white plaintiffs. However, the § 1985 claims based on this *971 contention fails for two reasons. First, the Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit have indicated an intent to limit the protections of § 1985 to discrimination against "those classes of persons who are, so far as the enforcement of their rights is concerned, `in unprotected circumstances similar to those of the victims of Klan violence.'"

Case No. 11-1436 (C.A. 4), holding:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To recapitulate, we hold as follows. We reverse the district court's denial of all defendants' motions to dismiss the federal claims alleged against them. We reverse the court's denial of the City's motion for summary judgment as to the state common-law claims alleged against it. We affirm the court's denial of Officers Gottlieb and Himan's motions to dismiss the state common-law malicious prosecution claims alleged against them. We reverse the court's denial of the officers' motions to dismiss all other state common-law claims. We dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction the City's appeal of the state constitutional claims alleged against it. Finally, we remand the cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://judicialview.com/Court-Cases/Constitutional_Law/Evans-v-Chalmers/17/568746|title=Federal Cases &gt; Constitutional Law Evans v Chalmers|publisher=Judicial View|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The only claims to survive this decision were state constitutional claims. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III concurred, ruling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A few additional observations may underscore the overblown nature of this case. Plaintiffs have sought to raise every experimental claim and to corral every conceivable defendant. The result is a case on the far limbs of law and one destined, were it to succeed in whole, to spread damage in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-4th-circuit/1617846.html|title=Evans V. Chalmers|website=Caselaw.findlaw.com|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On October 7, 2013, the United States Supreme Court denied the Petition for Certorari filed by Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans, declining to review the decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/evans-v-city-of-durham|title=Casetext|publisher=Casetext|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2014, the three accused lacrosse players and the City of Durham settled their long-running lawsuit. Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans agreed to dismiss their lawsuit and received no monetary compensation whatsoever. The city agreed to make a $50,000 grant to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/durham-settles-with-wrongly-accused-duke-lacrosse-players/13650645|title=Durham settles with wrongly accused Duke lacrosse players|website=WRAL.com|date=2014-05-16|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit filed by non-accused players and their families==
On February 21, 2008, the families of 38 of the lacrosse team's 47 members who were not accused filed a 225-page lawsuit against [[Duke University]], the Duke University Hospital, the city of [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], and various officials of each organization for multiple claims of harassment, deprivation of civil rights, breach of contract and other claims.&lt;ref name="Unindicted Lawsuit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Duke Lacrosse Players File Federal Lawsuit Against University, City of Durham|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,331568,00.html|work=Fox News|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5h6xRBSx3?url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,331568,00.html|archivedate=May 28, 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=May 22, 2009|date=February 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Duke University spokesperson responded that "[w]e have now seen the lawsuit and as we said before, if these plaintiffs have a complaint, it is with Mr. Nifong. Their legal strategy – attacking Duke – is misdirected and without merit. To help these families move on, Duke offered to cover the cost of any attorneys' fees or other out-of-pocket expenses, but they rejected this offer. We will vigorously defend the university against these claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/lacrosse/bal-sp.duke22feb22,0,156697.story|title=Other Duke players, parents file lawsuit|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 22, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5h6xQmtsw?url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/lacrosse/bal-sp.duke22feb22,0,156697.story|archivedate=May 28, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,331568,00.html|title=Duke Lacrosse Players File Federal Lawsuit Against University, City of Durham|publisher=FoxNews|accessdate=May 22, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5h6xRBSx3?url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,331568,00.html|archivedate=May 28, 2009|deadurl=no|date=February 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city never released an official response to the suit.

==ESPN documentary: ''Fantastic Lies''==
The 2016 documentary film ''Fantastic Lies'', which centered around the case and its aftermath, was part of [[ESPN]]'s ''[[30 for 30]]'' film series. It premiered on March 13, 2016, 10 years to the day after the lacrosse players hosted the house party where Mangum claimed she was raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deitsch|first1=Richard|title=New ESPN 30 for 30 documentary to look back at Duke lacrosse case|url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2016/03/09/duke-lacrosse-case-look-back-media-circus|accessdate=March 28, 2016|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the journalists invited to contribute was ESPN college basketball analyst and Duke graduate [[Jay Bilas]], who in his other capacity as a practicing attorney later wrote a letter to the university administration criticizing their handling of the entire situation and describing president [[Richard H.

'''''Elisabeth''''' is a Viennese, German-language [[Musical theatre|musical]] commissioned by the [[Vereinigte Bühnen Wien]] (VBW), with book/lyrics by [[Michael Kunze]] and music by [[Sylvester Levay]]. It portrays the life and death of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], wife of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph I]]. It has been translated into seven languages and seen by over ten million spectators worldwide, making it the most successful German-language musical of all time.

==Summary==

The musical tells the story of Elisabeth ("Sisi"), the Empress of Austria, from her engagement and marriage in 1854 to her murder in 1898 at the hands of the Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni, through the lens of her growing obsession with Death as her marriage and her empire crumble around her at the turn of the century.

==Synopsis==

The show opens in the "nightly world of the dead and the dreamers", where Luigi Lucheni is being interrogated by a Judge as to why he has murdered the Empress Elisabeth. Lucheni claims that he did no more than what Elisabeth herself wanted, since all her life Elisabeth has been in love with Death himself - and vice versa. As his witnesses, Lucheni brings back the dead aristocracy of the bygone era and takes us to the past, where he serves as a sarcastic narrator of the events that lead to the transformation of the sweet and innocent Sisi to the revered and infamous Elisabeth, Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, and her decline through later years until her assassination.

At a young age, Sisi, grown up in a seemingly sorrowless environment, experiences her first encounter with Death, which launches a love-hate affair that will span her entire life.
Lucheni claims that once Franz Joseph, the Emperor of Austria, picks Elisabeth as his bride - for once opposing his domineering mother Sophie - he begins a chain of events that will eventually topple the Habsburg empire. Elisabeth herself very soon comes to regret her seemingly "fairy-tale marriage." She feels abandoned by her careless husband, psychologically abused by her possessive mother-in-law, and is chronically depressed due to her loneliness. There is only one thing that keeps her emotionally stimulated—the dark and sensual shadow of Death; but Elisabeth is reluctant to consummate their relationship. When Death takes her infant daughter, the tragedy shakes the young Empress extremely, but she refuses to give in to Death's sway.

After her other two children, including her only son Rudolf, are taken away by Sophie, Elisabeth calluses over and becomes cold and selfish. She flees the Austrian court and spends decades restlessly travelling all over the world, trying in vain to escape from her fear of emptiness. Eventually, Elisabeth makes peace with her husband and finds new meaning in her life when she helps unify Austria and Hungary, but her newfound purpose makes her neglect her psychologically delicate son even further, sending young Rudolf into deep depression and causing him to bond with Death.

Eventually, Rudolf's own loneliness and his father's pressure cause him to snap and he embraces Death, committing suicide at Mayerling with his mistress, Mary Vetsera. This event completely breaks down Elisabeth and she begs Death to take her. However, her scorned lover now refuses to take her in.

Another decade goes by. Elisabeth still wanders from place to place, dressed in permanent mourning. Franz Joseph visits her from time to time, begging her to return home to Vienna, firmly believing that love is the answer to all sorrows, but Elisabeth refuses, citing that sometimes love is simply not enough to cure old wounds.

Finally, in a horrifying vision of the fall of the House of Habsburg, Franz Joseph at last meets his mysterious rival. He watches as Death throws Lucheni a dagger, but crushed by the weight of his imperial crest, he is powerless to save his wife.

On September 10, 1898, while on her way to board a ship in Geneva, Empress Elisabeth of Austria is mortally wounded, stabbed in the heart with a crudely sharpened file. As she lies dying, Death comes to claim her spirit with a kiss. With their embrace, the show ends.

==CD and DVD releases==

''Elisabeth'' has been known to inspire a collector's mania that does not limit itself solely to audio and visual memorabilia. However, as of November 2007, there have been a total of at least twenty-five cast albums, complete works, demos, and promotional albums/singles, as well as eight commercial DVDs of the show, released to the public.

The '''Feast of Saint Raphael''' or '''Malakhayude Perunnal''' is an annual festival held in [[Ollur]], near [[Thrissur]], [[Kerala]] ([[India]]), since 1839. It draws thousands of pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;A. Sreedhara Menon, ''Social and Cultural History of Kerala'' (1979), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ollur [[forane]] church, founded in 1718 and dedicated to St Anthony, also houses a famous Shrine of [[Raphael the Archangel]].&lt;ref&gt;José Pereira, ''Baroque India: The Neo-Roman Religious Architecture of [[South Asia]]'' (2000), pp. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the oldest churches built in 18th-century [[Kerala]]. The festival, held on October 23 and 24 of each year, is one of the most important Christian festivals in [[Kerala]]. The festival starts with the hoisting of the ceremonial flag on October 15 to mark the beginning of the celebrations in the church compound.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hindu.com/2004/10/11/stories/2004101105220300.htm Ollur Church Fete Begins on October 23]" ''[[The Hindu]]'', Oct. 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of half a dozen Christian festivals listed by Kerala Tourism as among the attractions of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keralatourism.org/festivalcalendar/category.php?cat=2012 Kerala Tourism], accessed 29 Oct. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The main attraction of the festival is the Vala (Bangle) procession which is coming from the six zones of [[Ollur]] parish on October 23. These Valas will conclude at the foot of the rock-cross of the church.  The processions are very attractive by glittering chariot, ''[[muthukkuda]]s'' (multi coloured silk umbrellas), many types of ''[[Indian musical instruments|vadyams]]'' and ''[[melam]]s'' and followed by firework displays in the church grounds.

The main part of the festival is the main procession carrying the statues of the four angels, [[Raphael (archangel)|Saint Raphael]], [[Saint Michael]], [[Gabriel|Saint Gabriel]], and the Guardian Angel, in the ''Roopakkoodu'' (an intricately decorated support or surround). Formerly accompanied by ''[[Kolam Thullal|thullal]]'' (popularly known as "devil dancing"), this aspect of the festival has in more recent years been suppressed by ecclesiastical order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smcim.org/ollur/festivals.htm Festival webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The [[St. Anthony's Forane Church]], [[Ollur]], was built by the resident christian families of Ollur under the leadership of Chiramel Chakoru Palu, a resident of [[Ollur]], who got the permission from the Raja of Cochin. The foundation stone of the church was laid by Rev. Marottical Poulose.&lt;ref&gt;http://chiramels.com/aboutus.html&lt;/ref&gt; The church was built in typical Kerala Vaastushilpa architectural style in the period 1883-1893. The Ollur Forane church is one of the best models of Christian architecture in India. The Ollur church is one of the wealthiest in the whole of Kerala.For some pictures of the Ollur Forane church see &lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianchristianity.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nazraney.com/journal12.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Saint Raphael==
Raphael is the name of an archangel of Christianity who is one of three angels listed by name in the Bible. The Roman Catholic Church assigns the feast of [[Raphael (archangel)|Saint Raphael]] to October 24. He stands in the choir of archangels and is one of the seven angels who stand before the Throne of God. His name is known in the Bible where he, in the book of Tobit, is the traveling companion of the Tobias, a young man. The Church calls on him as the angel of love, patron of medical doctors and of travelers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nazraney.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Free Press Summer Festival''' was an annual two-day music festival held in [[Houston, Texas]] at [[Buffalo Bayou]]'s [[Eleanor Tinsley Park]].

Other activities include fireworks, interactive art installations, a paint slide, music workshops, a 30-foot water wall and an off-site after party.

The festival was started to emphasize local musical performers, visual arts and artists. A recycling program, [[carbon offset]] credits and a partnership with the [[Texas Campaign for the Environment]] are implemented to help this festival become a greener experience.

The festival is organized by ''[[Free Press Houston]]'', a local independent newspaper and Pegstar.net Presents, a local concert promotion company.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://houston.about.com/od/eventsfestivals/a/Summerfest.htm|title=A Guide to Houston Summer Fest|publisher=About.com|first=Shea|last=Serrano|accessdate=February 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 30, 2017 it has been made official by both Free Press Houston and Austin City Limits promotors that a new version of the festival is to take place in Houston on the weekend of March 24–25, 2018 under a new name; In Bloom Music Festival. This change comes in precisely on the ninth anniversary of the FPSF.

==Environment==

A recycling plan (with assistance from Little Joy Recycling) sorts aluminum, plastic, paper and glass. A free bottle of water is given to anyone who recycles 10 plastic bottles. All carbon output is balanced by [[Carbon credits|carbon offset credits]]. [[Carpooling]] and bicycling to the festival are encouraged. Over 2000 attendees biked to the 2009 festival.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Fancy Pants Tent==

In February 2011, a new pass was introduced that would have granted access to a premium side stage viewing area and entry to a limited access [[electronic music]] tent. The Fancy Pants Tent was intended to host exclusive performances by electronic musicians and provide complimentary bar drinks and hors d'œuvres, free massages and meet and greets.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Complaints about the cost led festival organizers to remove the Fancy Pants ticket tier in April 2011 and announced that all festival attendees would be able to watch the Fancy Pants acts.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==History==

===2009===
The 2009 festival was held August 8–9 with an attendance of approximately 30,000. A portion of the proceeds went to Project Row Houses (a community non-profit responsible for restoration, art and social activism in Houston's [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]] since 1991).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===2014===
The 2014 festival was held on May 31 - June 1, 2014.

The venue was closed and the first day was evacuated at about 1:00pm due to bad weather and lightning. Many acts were bumped or rescheduled with no notice when gates were rumored to be reopened at 3:30pm. Upon return many acts had sound trouble. Weather and construction at the park caused many stages to be moved to the Allen Parkway tarmac, often creating congestion and competing for sound. Partial refunds were not offered.

== About ==
The festival is one of Ireland’s leading cultural enterprises and has contributed significantly to putting Galway on the map, as both a key cultural centre for the arts and a cultural tourism destination. It has also founded and acted as a seedbed for a number of well-known and established arts organizations in Galway.

Originally The Galway Arts Festival, the organization was founded in 1978 by [[University College, Galway|University College Galway]]'s Arts Society in collaboration with community activists of Galway Arts Group. The first festival was described in local papers as "Galway Arts Society's Week of Craic." Their original budget was €1000 of Arts Council Funding and most of the artistic events were staged in an arts centre that now homes Sheridan's Cheesemongers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=40 Things You Might Not Know About GIAF |url=https://www.giaf.ie/about/giaf-40/facts/ |website=Galway International Arts Festival |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The name was changed in 2014, to Galway International Arts Festival, to emphasize the diversity of contributors to the festival. "The festival presents and produces work in Galway which sits side by side with the work of artists and companies from around the world," Artistic Director Paul Fahy explained. "Both are local and global; both are international." The name change also facilitated the vision of the festival as a producing body, creating works that tour internationally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Andrews |first1=Kernan |title=Galway International Arts Festival 2014- what's on, who's coming |url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/69887/galway-international-arts-festival-2014-whats-on-whos-coming |accessdate=17 September 2018 |publisher=Galway Advertiser |date=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The Festival ==
The festival takes place in [[Galway, Ireland]] for two weeks in late July. It presents and produces programmes across  theatre, music, visual arts, opera, street spectacle, dance, discussion and comedy. The 2018 festival set records for attendance, breaking a quarter million for the first time, representing a 20% increase over the participants in the 2017 festival. Over 600 artists created and took part in over 200 events across the festival. This 41st festival also featured a brand new Festival Garden which transformed Eyre Square into a gathering place for locals and visitors alike, offering pop-up performances and local food stands. The Festival Garden attracted more than 145,000 people. Visitors to the 2017 festival were estimated to be 45% from Galway, 18% around the rest of Ireland, and 37% outside of Ireland. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sensational shows &amp; record-breaking attendance for 41st Galway International Arts Festival |url=https://www.giaf.ie/news/sensational-shows-record-breaking-attendance-and-box-office-for-41st-galway |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Touring ==
In the last seven years, the organization has produced or co-produced 23 productions and has toured to London, New York, Edinburgh, Chicago, Adelaide, Sydney, Hong Kong and Washington. These include 4 major exhibition commissions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tours |url=https://www.giaf.ie/tours |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Leon Gary Plauche''' (November 10, 1945 – October 20, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/137622607 ''Leon Gary Plauche' memorial'']&lt;/ref&gt; was an American man known for the 1984 [[vigilante]] killing of Jeff Doucet, who had [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] his son, Jody Plauche. The killing occurred on Friday, March 16, 1984, and it was captured on camera by a news television crew. Although Plauche shot and killed Doucet, he was given a seven-year [[suspended sentence]] with five years' [[probation]] and 300 hours of [[community service]] for the shooting and received no jail time. The case received wide publicity because some people questioned whether Plauche should be charged with murder or be let off. Plauche stated that he was in the right, and that those in a similar position would have done the same thing.&lt;ref name=Toluna.Father/&gt;

== Kidnapping by Doucet ==
Gary Plauche lived in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]. He was separated from his wife June at the time of the shooting. In 1984, his 11-year-old son, Jody Plauche, was taking [[karate]] lessons. Jody's karate instructor, 25-year-old Jeffrey Doucet, had been sexually abusing Jody for at least a year. In February 1984, Doucet kidnapped Jody and took him to a motel in California where he sexually assaulted and molested him. Police searched the country for Jody, and he was eventually found after Doucet allowed Jody to place a collect call to his mother from the motel. California police raided the motel and arrested Doucet without incident.&lt;ref name=ESPN.Father/&gt;

On March 1, 1984, Jody was returned to his family in Louisiana, but Gary, who was 38 at the time, heard reports that Doucet had sexually assaulted his son. In an interview with a news television crew, Gary said that he did not know what to do and just felt helpless.&lt;ref name="youtube.com" /&gt;

== Doucet's killing by Plauche ==
On Friday, March 16, 1984, Doucet was flown back from California to [[Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport]], also known as Ryan Field, to face trial. Doucet arrived and was led in handcuffs by police officers through the airport at around 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., where Plauche was waiting for Doucet with a gun.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi3Hyxuf5AE|title=Father of Kidnapped Son gets Revenge|date=2 July 2006|work=YouTube|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plauche was friends with several high-ranking police officers in the Baton Rouge Police Department; while many people believed that these contacts told Plauche where and when Doucet would be arriving, it was actually an employee of the TV news station [[WBRZ-TV]] who gave Plauche the information. A news television crew was also waiting for Doucet and had set up their cameras to record his arrival. Opposite the news crew was a bank of pay telephones, where Plauche waited while talking to his best friend on a telephone. He wore a baseball cap and sunglasses, so no one recognized him.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

As Doucet was escorted through the airport, he passed the television crew who were taping the scene. He then walked past Plauche, who took out his gun and fired a single shot, directly at the right side of Doucet's head, at [[point-blank range]]. Doucet immediately fell to the floor, and Plauche placed the gun down before officers restrained him.&lt;ref name=LATimes.Father/&gt;

The entire incident was captured on videotape. Officers grabbed hold of Plauche and recognized who he was at once. They kept him pinned against the bank of telephones, asking him as captured on camera, "Gary, why? Why, Gary?"&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

Doucet died the next day.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Dead/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulletin.Judge/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Plauche was initially charged with [[second-degree murder]] but agreed to a [[plea bargain]] in which he pleaded [[no contest]] to [[manslaughter]]. He was sentenced to seven years [[suspended sentence|suspended]], with five years' [[probation]] and 300 hours of [[community service]], which he completed in 1989.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Sentenced/&gt;

Psychological Reports helped Plauche's case after it was learned that Doucet had abused Jody Plauche months prior to the kidnapping. Dr. Edward P. Uzee examined Plauche and determined that he could not tell the difference between right and wrong when he killed Doucet. Uzee also determined that Doucet had the ability to manipulate others and took advantage of the fact that Plauche was separated from his wife June at the time, and had managed to wedge his way into the Plauche family. Judge Frank Saia ruled that sending Plauche to prison would not help anyone, and that there was virtually no risk of him committing another crime.&lt;ref name=Bulletin.Judge/&gt;

The video of Plauche killing Doucet has been featured on many shock television programs and documentaries, including the 2002 [[Michael Moore]] documentary ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' and the 1993 [[shockumentary]] ''[[Traces of Death]]''. The footage has also been uploaded to [[YouTube]], where the video has received more than 20 million views.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; The video featured on YouTube was taken from the television series, ''[[Anatomy of Crime]]'', which aired in 2000 on [[Court TV]] and was produced by [[John Langley]], the creator of ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]''.&lt;ref name="youtube.com" /&gt;

== Death ==
Plauche suffered a stroke in 2011&lt;ref name=ESPN.Father/&gt; and died in 2014 aged 68 at a nursing home after another stroke.&lt;ref&gt;Schmaltz, Trey (October 22, 2014).

'''Google Code-in''' ('''GCI''') is an annual programming competition hosted by [[Google|Google Inc.]] that allows pre-university students to complete tasks specified by various, partnering open source organizations. The contest was originally the [[Google Highly Open Participation Contest]], but in 2010, the format was modified into its current state. Students that complete tasks win certificates and T-shirts. Each organization also selects two grand prize award winners who will earn a trip to [[Googleplex|Google's Headquarters]] located in Mountain View, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Google Code-in|url=http://www.google-melange.com/gci/document/show/gci_program/google/gci2013/help_page|publisher=Google|accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://opensource.com/education/14/12/google-code-teen-initiative|title = Google Code-in tasks and rewards for teens|date = |accessdate = |website = Opensource.com|publisher = Red Hat|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The program began as [[Google Highly Open Participation Contest]]. In 2010, the program was modified into Google Code-in. After the 2014 edition, the Google Melange was replaced by a separate website for Google Code-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-summer-of-code-discuss/xgKLwl6Dr0Y|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mauritius]], an [[Africa|African]] country, participated for the first time in 2016, and was noticed for its strong debut&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://opensource.googleblog.com/2016/12/taking-pulse-of-google-code-in-2016.html|title=Taking the pulse of Google Code-in 2016|work=Google Open Source Blog|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017, produced its first Grand Prize winner &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/01/google-code-in-2017-winners.html|title=Announcing the Winners of Google Code-in 2017|work=Google Open Source Blog|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Google Code-in grand prize winners ceremony 12.jpg|alt=Google Code-in 2015 Grand Prize Winners Trip|thumb|Google Code-in 2015 Grand Prize winners' trip ]]
Google partners with certain open source organizations, all of which have had previous experience working with Google open source programs like [[Google Summer of Code]]. These organizations come up with "bite-sized" tasks that are self-contained, designed for pre-university students to complete. When the contest begins, students can register and claim tasks. Once claimed, students will have a set period of time to complete the task and can receive help from the mentor and the organization's community. Students may ask for deadline extensions if needed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contest Rules for Google Code-in 2013 |url=https://www.google-melange.com/gci/document/show/gci_program/google/gci2013/contest_rules |publisher=Google |accessdate=31 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101064828/https://www.google-melange.com/gci/document/show/gci_program/google/gci2013/contest_rules |archivedate=1 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the Greenlandic national broadcaster [[Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa]] (KNR) has attempted to gain EBU membership and thus participate independently in the Eurovision Song Contest. However KNR cannot obtain EBU membership due to the autonomous country not being independent from the [[Kingdom of Denmark]].

'''Infoseek''' was a popular internet [[search engine]] founded in 1994 by [[Steve Kirsch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kirschfoundation.org/who/about.html|title=Kirsch Foundation About the Founders|website=www.kirschfoundation.org|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infoseek was originally operated by the '''Infoseek Corporation''', headquartered in [[Sunnyvale, California]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/19970702014416/http://info.infoseek.com/doc/contact.html Contacting Infoseek]." Infoseek. July 2, 1997. Retrieved on January 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Infoseek was bought by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 1999,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/07/12/deals/disney/|title=Disney absorbs Infoseek - Jul. 12, 1999|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the technology was merged with that of the Disney-acquired [[Starwave]] to form the [[Go.com]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2016/09/mike-slade-on-80s-microsoft-next-starwave-and-steve-jobs-return-to-apple/|title=Mike Slade on 80s Microsoft, NeXT, Starwave and Steve Jobs’ Return to Apple|work=Internet History Podcast|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By September 1997, Infoseek had 7.3 million visitors per month.&lt;ref name="source"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clubi.ie/webserch/engines/infoseek/history.htm|title=Infoseek - a history (from WebSerch)|last=|first=|date=2009-05-01|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501140446/http://www.clubi.ie/webserch/engines/infoseek/history.htm|archive-date=May 1, 2009|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It bought out the [[WebChat Broadcasting System]] in April 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/15/business/fi-39335|title=Infoseek to Buy WebChat Broadcasting|last=Reuters|date=1998-04-15|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Disney purchased a 43% stake of Infoseek, and incorporated the site into its various media businesses. Around the same time, Disney acquired the [[Starwave]] Corporation, which included ESPN.com and ABCNews.com.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofseo.com/The-Industry/Short_History_of_Early_Search_Engines.aspx|title=Short History of Early Search Engines – The History of SEO|website=www.thehistoryofseo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Disney acquired the remaining Infoseek stock it didn't own. Disney bundled its Starwave properties and Infoseek and formed the GO.com portal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Infoseek was among the first search engines to sell advertising on a [[Cost per impression|CPM]], Cost Per Thousand Impressions, basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mediaaudit.com/media-watchdog/the-media-transparency-standoff-20-years-in-the-making/|title=Media Transparency Standoff: 20 Years In The Making - Media Management, Inc.|date=2016-09-01|work=Media Management Inc.|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the first Cost Per Click programs, as well as the precursor to pop-ups called daughter windows, was sold by east coast sales executive Robert Formentin to [[Grey Global Group|Grey Advertising]] for a [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] [[Pampers]] campaign.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1998, Infoseek was the first internet company to develop and launch [[behavioral targeting]] via its UltraMatch targeting algorithms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In 1999, Infoseek engineer [[Li Yanhong]] moved to [[Beijing]], [[China]] and co-founded the search engine [[Baidu]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In February 2001, Disney decided to cancel the service and lay off all staff. Also in 2001, Bernt Wahl, Andy Bensky and 15 software engineers, all Infoseek employees, led a management buyout attempt from Disney but were ultimately rebuffed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Infoseek's Ultraseek Server software technology, an enterprise search engine product, was sold in 2000 to [[Inktomi]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under Inktomi, Ultraseek Server was renamed "Inktomi Enterprise Search". In December 2002 (prior to the [[Yahoo!]] acquisition of Inktomi), the Ultraseek product suite was sold to a competitor [[Verity Inc]], who re-established the Ultraseek brand name and continued development of the product.

In December 2005, Verity was acquired by [[Autonomy Corporation|Autonomy PLC]]. Under Autonomy, Ultraseek ceased to be a stand-alone product and became a modular component under the IDOL platform. It continued to be developed and marketed as Autonomy's entry-level keyword-based site search offering until after [[Autonomy Corporation|Autonomy]] was acquired by [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) in October 2011.

==Domain name==
The "infoseek.com" [[domain name]] redirects to the "go.com" website. The brand name Infoseek is only used in [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoseek.com.au/|title=Infoseek Australia|website=www.infoseek.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoseek.co.jp|title=楽天が運営するポータルサイト ： 【インフォシーク】Infoseek|website=www.infoseek.co.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ISL collapsed in 2001 with debts of £153million.&lt;ref name="bribe-shadow"&gt;{{Cite news |date=13 March 2008|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/davidbond/2294323/The-66m-bribe-shadow-hanging-over-Fifa.html|title=The £66m 'bribe' shadow hanging over Fifa|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, following a four-year investigation by prosecutors in the Swiss canton of [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], six former ISL executives, including the former chairman Jean Marie Weber, were accused of a series of charges including fraud, embezzlement and the falsification of documents.&lt;ref name="bribe-shadow"/&gt;

ISL was established by former [[Adidas]] boss [[Horst Dassler]], ISL were associated with FIFA, the [[International Olympic Committee]] and the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]].&lt;ref name="bribe-shadow"/&gt;

Court documents released in 2012 show that two FIFA executives, former president [[João Havelange]] and [[Ricardo Teixeira]], received 41m CHF (£27m) worth of bribes from ISL between 1992 and 2000. Only 3m CHF of these were repaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/11/fifa-joao-havelange-bribes-report|work=The Guardian|title=Former Fifa president João Havelange 'received millions in bribes'|date=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, the reformed [[FIFA Ethics Committee]] began investigating the illegal payments made by ISL, in addition to evaluating the behaviour of [[FIFA president]] [[Sepp Blatter]] in the affair.&lt;ref name=GuardJul12&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/17/fifa-michael-j-garcia-football-corruption|title=Fifa appoints Michael J Garcia to investigate football corruption|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=17 July 2012|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNJul12&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA unveils new crime fighting duo to tackle corruption in soccer|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/17/sport/football/football-fifa-ethics-corruption/|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=15 November 2014|date=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISL had specialized in buying and selling broadcast rights to FIFA events such as World Cups on contracts worth millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=IndyISL/&gt; The case was closed on 30 April 2014 after an investigation by Garcia, with [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]] ruling that bribes had been paid by ISL between 1992 and 2000 to Havelange, Teixeira and [[Nicolas Leoz]], then-president of [[CONMEBOL]]. As Havelange (honorary president of FIFA) and Leoz had already resigned from their posts earlier in April 2014, no "[[wiktionary:superfluous#Adjective|superfluous]]" further action was taken.&lt;ref name=IndyISL/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCISL/&gt; In contrast, Blatter was exonerated of "criminal or ethical misconduct", but was also described as "clumsy" and it was questioned whether he "knew or should have known over the years before the bankruptcy of ISL that ISL had made bribes to other FIFA officials".&lt;ref name=IndyISL&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pitt-Brooke|first1=Jack|title=Joao Havelange guilty of taking bribes for World Cup rights but 'clumsy' Fifa president Sepp Blatter escapes|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/joao-havelange-guilty-of-taking-bribes-for-world-cup-rights-but-clumsy-fifa-president-sepp-blatter-escapes-8598250.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCISL&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bond|first1=David|title=Fifa's report into ISL scandal is just window dressing|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/22355455|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|text=the [[Standard Written Form]] of Cornish}}
'''Kernowek Standard''' (KS, ''Standard Cornish''), its initial version spelt '''Kernowak Standard''', is a variety of the spelling of revived [[Cornish language|Cornish]]. It has two specifications, the first of which was published as a draft proposal in March 2007, and the second of which was published as a practical orthography in May 2012.

==Kernowak Standard (KS1)==
Its first iteration, then spelt '''Kernowak Standard''' and now designated '''KS1''', was developed gradually by a group called ''UdnFormScrefys'' ('Single Written Form') as part of the Cornish language community's process of agreement on a [[Standard Written Form]] (SWF) for Cornish through the public body [[Cornish Language Partnership]]. It was published as a proposal in a series of revisions, Revision 11 of which was released to the Cornish Language Commission on 26 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kernowek.net/kernowak-revision-11.pdf A proposed Standard Written Form of Cornish], 26 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal authors were [[Michael Everson]], Neil Kennedy and [[Nicholas Williams]]. Revision 15 was published on 22 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kernowek.net/kernowak-revision-16.pdf A proposed Standard Written Form of Cornish], 22 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Revision 16 was published on 14 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kernowek.net/kernowak-revision-16.pdf A proposed Standard Written Form of Cornish], 14 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal authors were [[Michael Everson]], Neil Kennedy and [[Nicholas Williams]].The orthography was meant to adhere to two basic requirements which the group identified with: to be based on orthographic forms attested in the [[Cornish literature|Cornish literary]] scribal tradition, and to have an unambiguous relationship between spelling and sounds. To embrace both Middle and Late Cornish forms, Kernowak Standard took as its foundation the late Middle Cornish play ''Creation of the World'' by [[William Jordan (writer)|William Jordan]] (1611). On 14 October 2007, during the process of agreeing a [[Standard Written Form]] for Cornish, Kernowak Standard (as KS1) was designated to provide a key source of input into the new SWF, along with another orthography, [[Kernewek Kemmyn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kernowek.net/Commission-statement-14.10.2007.pdf Statement from the Commission for a Single Written Form of Cornish], 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kernowek Standard (KS)==
After the publication of the specification of the agreed Standard Written Form,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/idoc.ashx?docid=36518aec-21e6-4ea9-8a3a-e4ccc27d7fe8&amp;version=-1 An Outline of the Standard Written Form of Cornish], 3 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; members of ''UdnFormScrefys'', after scrutinising the published description, decided to form a new, public group, called ''Spellyans'' ('Spelling'). This group undertook to study the SWF, to determine what shortcomings it might have, and to propose and implement solutions to those shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;http://kernowek.net/ Spellyans website&lt;/ref&gt; The group identified what they saw as a number of inconsistencies, ambiguities, and errors, and discussion on an online discussion list led to the publication of a number of texts in the resulting orthography, '''Kernowek Standard''', designated as '''KS''' and not '''KS2''', culminating in the publication of the Bible in Cornish and a comprehensive grammar, ''Desky Kernowek''&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Nicholas. 2012. ''Desky Kernowek: A Complete Guide to Cornish''. Cathair na Mart: Evertype. {{ISBN|978-1-904808-99-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 May 2012.

Before the [[Standard Written Form]] was reviewed in 2013, KS was described by its proponents as a proposal for a number of changes to be made to the SWF. The following changes were proposed, although only the last one was ultimately adopted by the [[Cornish Language Partnership]] during the SWF's review:

*The supporters of KS argue that the SWF inherited what the group calls an "inconsistency" from [[Kernewek Kemmyn]] with regard to the distribution of the letters ⟨i⟩ and ⟨y⟩ outside monosyllables. For example, the SWF currently has ''palys'' 'palace' and ''gonis'' 'work', but it also has ''kegin'' 'kitchen' and ''kemmyn'' 'common', even though the final sound is the same. Supporters of the current distribution argue that it is etymological and maintains the correct sound when suffixes are added (singular ''kegin'' becomes plural ''keginow'').
*The group also argues that the SWF is ambiguous and inconsistent in its use of ⟨u⟩, which can be pronounced a number of ways. KS proposed the use of ⟨û⟩ for {{IPA|/uː/}}, e.g. ''frût'' 'fruit', to prevent confusion with another ⟨u⟩ sound that can be pronounced either {{IPA|/iː/}} or {{IPA|/yː/}} (e.g. ''tus'' 'people'), and ⟨ù⟩ for short {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, e.g. ''pùb'' 'every', also to prevent confusion with the ⟨u⟩ above.
*The addition of the digraphs ⟨ai⟩ {{IPA|[eː]}}, to distinguish from ⟨ay⟩ {{IPA|[aɪ]}} and ⟨ey⟩ {{IPA|/əɪ/}}, and ⟨au⟩ {{IPA|/ɔ/}} ({{IPA|[ɔː]~[ɔ]}}) to distinguish from ⟨aw⟩ {{IPA|/aʊ/}}.
*The principal devisor of Kernowek Standard, Nicholas Williams, argues that current use of the graphs ⟨av⟩, ⟨ev⟩, and ⟨edh⟩ in final unstressed position results in incorrect pronunciation. He maintains that a consonant switch between stressed and unstressed final position should be made, stressed ⟨av⟩, ⟨ev⟩, and ⟨edh⟩ switching to unstressed ⟨af⟩, ⟨ef⟩, and ⟨eth⟩ respectively, similar to the SWF's current ⟨g⟩/⟨k⟩ and ⟨b⟩/⟨p⟩ switch.
*Correction of an inconsistency between ''menydh'' 'mountain' (Welsh ''mynydd'') and ''nowyth'' 'new' (Welsh ''newydd''). In KS, both are spelt with -th because they are in final unstressed syllables. During the SWF review, the spelling of ''nowydh'' was accepted for the SWF. The supporters of KS argue that this was the wrong one of the two choices.

'''Vilnius Queer Festival “Kreivės”''' is a cultural and social initiative which started in 2014.

The '''Mapimí Silent Zone''' ({{lang-es|La Zona del Silencio}}) is the popular name for a desert patch near the [[Bolsón de Mapimí]] in [[Durango]], [[Mexico]], overlapping the [[Mapimí Biosphere Reserve]]. It is the subject of an [[urban myth]] that claims it is an area where [[radio signal]]s and any type of communications cannot be received.&lt;ref name=Eckles&gt;{{cite web|last=Eckles|first=Jim|title=The Athena That Got Away|url=http://143.84.21.9/pao/FactSheets/AthenatoMexico.htm|publisher=White Sands Missile Range|accessdate=21 February 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaus&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaus|first=Andrea|title=The Zone Of Silence of northern Mexico - scientific marvel or just fiction?|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1468-the-zone-of-silence-of-nothern-mexico-scientific-marvel-or-just-fiction|publisher=MexConnect|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Scientists have dubbed this area as the "Mar de Tetys", or the Sea of Thetys, because this area was once completely submerged in water. This is evidenced by traces of marine life fossils found in the area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In July 1970 an Athena test missile launched from a U.S. military base near Green River, Utah toward [[White Sands Missile Range]] lost control and fell in the Mapimí Desert region.
When the rocket went off course, it was carrying two small containers of [[Isotopes of cobalt#Table|cobalt 57]], a radioactive element.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19700804&amp;id=2180AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ShEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3568,432596&amp;hl=en|title = Mexicans Find Radioactive Cone|last = Associated Press|first = |date = August 4, 1970|work = The Milwaukee Sentinel|access-date = July 27, 2015|via = Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19700804&amp;id=ZclOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wgEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3586,4256164&amp;hl=en|title = Mexicans Find Errant Rocket|last = Associated Press|first = |date = August 4, 1970|work = The Toledo Blade|access-date = July 27, 2015|via = Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After several weeks of searching, local farmers found and reported the crash in the Northeast corner of the State of Durango. Once the rocket was found, a road was built, and the missile wreckage and a [[Radioactive contamination#Low level contamination|small amount]] of [[Radioactive contamination#Surface contamination|contaminated top soil]] was transported away.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Legends ==
As a result of the US Air Force recovery operation there, a number of myths and legends relating to the area arose. Reportedly, a local resident hired to guard the crash debris during recovery operations helped spread these rumors. Legends include "strange magnetic anomalies that prevent radio transmission", mutations of flora and fauna, extraterrestrial visitations,&lt;ref name="Eckles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaus" /&gt; and a Mexican pilot who supposedly first reported that his radio experienced unexplained malfunctions while flying over the area in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The area is sometimes compared to the [[Bermuda Triangle]], as both are located between parallels 26 and 28.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;“Mapimi Silent Zone.” ''Atlas Obscura'', Web. Accessed 13 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, when compasses and communications equipment are shown to work properly in the zone, local [[new age]] and [[paranormal]] enthusiasts claim that "the zone moves around". Residents, who do not accept the zone's existence, call such enthusiasts "zoneros" or "silenciosos", and say their activities have an adverse effect on the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mapimi-silent-zone Mapimí Silent Zone - Atlas Obscura]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the legend is now being used to help promote tourism in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/exploring-mexicos-zone-of-silence-where-radio-signals-fail-and-meteorites-crash |last1=Wilson|first1=T.E.|title= Exploring Mexico’s Zone of Silence, Where Radio Signals Fail and Meteorites Crash|access-date=2018-04-24|website=atlasobscura.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Melodifestivalen 2017''' was the 57th edition of the Swedish music competition [[Melodifestivalen]], which selected Sweden's entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017]]. The competition was organised by [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT) and took place over a six-week period between 4 February and 11 March 2017.

The format of the competition consisted of 6 shows: 4 semi-final rounds, a second chance round and a final. An initial 28 entries were selected for the competition through three methods: an open call for song submissions, direct invitations to specific artists and songwriters and a wildcard given to one of the artists that participated in the ''Svensktoppen nästa'' competition organised by [[Sveriges Radio P4]]. The 28 competing entries were divided into four semi-finals, with seven compositions in each. From each semi-final, the songs that earn first and second place qualified directly to the final, while the songs that place third and fourth proceeded to the Second Chance round. The bottom three songs in each semi-final were eliminated from the competition. An additional four entries qualified from the Second Chance round to the final, bringing the total number of competing entries in the final to 12. All 6 shows were hosted by [[Clara Henry]], [[David Lindgren]] and [[Hasse Andersson]].

The winning song would compete for Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 to be held in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]. Sweden competed in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 on the 9th of May and had to place within the top 10 out of the 18 in their semi-final in order to qualify and compete in the final on 13 May.

=== Entry selection ===
Entries for the 2017 competition were selected through three methods:&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;
*14 entries were chosen by a selection panel from submissions received by SVT through an open call for songs.
*13 entries were selected by SVT via special invitations to artists and songwriters.
*1 entry was provided by the selected artist from the competition ''Svensktoppen nästa'' organised by [[Sveriges Radio P4]].

SVT opened two submission contests that accepted entries between 1 and 19 September 2016 for interested artists and songwriters to submit their proposals for the competition. The ''Regular contest'' was open for entries that had at least one songwriter that already had a musical work published, while the ''Public contest'' accepted entries from songwriters without previously published musical work.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt; Entries submitted for the competition were required to be new compositions which had never been published, between 2–3 minutes in length and with at least one songwriter that holds Swedish citizenship. The choice of language was free, however, SVT aims to have 30% of the contest's places reserved for entries sung mainly in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. SVT also aims to reserve at least 50% of the contest's places for entries written by female composers and lyricists either in a solo or collaborative capacity.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

Following the conclusion of the submission periods, SVT received 2,478 entries—an increase of 28 entries from the previous year. 2,116 of the entries were entered into the ''Regular contest'', while 362 entries were entered into the ''Public contest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Källman |first1=Pär |last2=Sinding-Larsen |first2=Madeleine |date=20 September 2016 |url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/2478-latar-tavlar-for-en-plats-i-melodifestivalen-2017 |title=2 478 låtar tävlar för en plats i Melodifestivalen 2017 |website=svt.se |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |accessdate=20 September 2016 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; SVT created a shortlist of entries from the received submissions and formed a selection panel that was tasked to select fourteen entries for the competition. Only five entries from the ''Public contest'' were under consideration with no guarantee that one would be selected to compete in Melodifestivalen.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

"'''Members Only'''" is the eighth episode in the [[South Park (season 20)|twentieth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 275th episode of the series overall, it first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on November 16, 2016.

The episode, while mostly progressing the season's plot, lampooned [[political correctness#2016 US presidential election|Donald Trump's rejection of political correctness during his presidential campaign]] and parodied a worst-case scenario of a Trump-led presidency.

==Plot==
The newly elected [[Mr. Garrison]] relishes his newfound authority by getting a [[Donald Trump]]-esque toupée and forcing [[List of South Park Elementary staff#PC Principal|PC Principal]] and other townspeople to perform [[fellatio]] on him as revenge for doubting him. However, as Denmark prepares to unleash their Troll Trace program worldwide, he is called to [[the Pentagon]] to manage the global crisis. Having absolutely no idea what to do, he angrily rebuffs a warning from [[Boris Johnson]] in [[London]]. Johnson warns Garrison that the country is collapsing after everybody ate the "[[Member Berries|mem'burries]]". Meanwhile, the member berries flood the [[White House]], where their leader, an aged [[The Godfather|Godfather]]-like berry, plans to bring back "the real Stormtroopers."

[[Butters Stotch|Butters]] suddenly joins [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Heidi Turner|Heidi Turner]] at the [[SpaceX]] building, hoping to leave Earth with them. Under the threat of Troll Trace, Butters has reversed his previous attitude toward women to the point where Heidi becomes interested in him, much to Cartman's annoyance. The three are disappointed to find that their desire to leave the planet was only taken metaphorically, as they are instead given a guided tour of the facility led by [[Elon Musk]]. After Musk explains that a Mars rocket is still several years away, he becomes interested in speeding up the process when offered Heidi's assistance.

Detained in the Troll Trace building in Denmark, [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Gerald Broflovski]] is given a cell phone by the Troll Trace CEO and is told he can call anybody to help him, although it will end up revealing his identity as Skankhunt42. Gerald calls [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] and instructs him to continue trolling as Skankhunt42, effectively framing Ike when Sheila catches him. When [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] comes home and finds Ike grounded, Kyle suddenly realizes his father has been the troll all along. He grabs Ike and leaves the house, leaving Shelia bewildered.

==Reception==
Jesse Schedeen with [[IGN]] rated the episode an 8.5 out of 10 and stated that he enjoyed how the episode "cleverly built on recent political events as it shed more light on the Member Berries and their true, horrifying plan for mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schedeeen|first=Jesse|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/17/south-park-members-only-review|website=[[IGN]]|date=November 16, 2016|accessdate=November 17, 2016|title=South Park: "Members Only" Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Lambert with 411 Mania rated it a 6.5 out of 10 and noted "Something just feels a bit off from the start of the season to now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Jeremy|title=South Park 20.8 Review – ‘Members Only’|url=http://411mania.com/movies/south-park-20-8-review-members-only/|website=411 Mania|accessdate=November 17, 2016|date=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Caffrey with ''[[The A.V.

'''''Miky Maous''''' is a Greek weekly comic that was first published on 1 July 1966, by Christos Terzopoulos. It was the second oldest comic title in [[Greece]] until it ceased publication in 2013. In 2006, the magazine surpassed 2000 issues and forty years of consecutive weekly print.

''Miky Maous'' was published by Nea Aktina A. E., a subsidiary of Terzopoulos Publishing S. A. and [[Lambrakis Press Group]] since 1999. At the beginning of September 2013, Miky Maous ceased publications due to the ongoing crisis in Greece, that caused budget problems to Nea Aktina.

In 2014, the magazine was relaunched by Kathimerini, with a new numbering starting again from #1.

In Greek culture, the phrase ''Miky Maous'' has become synonymous with comic books as almost every Greek has been a [[Disney]] magazine reader at some point in his or her life.

[[Image:Cattle In The Show Ring, Devon.jpg|thumb|Show halters and bulldog nose rings on cattle at an [[agricultural show]] in the United Kingdom]]
A '''nose ring''' is a ring made of metal designed to be installed through the nasal septum of [[pig]]s (to prevent them from [[Domestic pig#Rooting|rooting]]) as well as domestic [[cattle]], usually [[bull]]s.  In pigs, nose rings are alternatively pierced through the rim of the nose. Nose rings are often required for bulls when exhibited at [[agricultural show]]s. There is a clip-on ring design used for controlling and directing cattle for handling. Nose rings are used to encourage the [[weaning]] of young [[calf|calves]] by discouraging them from suckling.

==History==
[[File:Standard of ur.jpg|thumb|The Standard of Ur]]
Historically, the use of nose rings for controlling animals dates to the dawn of recorded human civilization.  They were used in ancient [[Sumer]] and are seen on the [[Standard of Ur]], where they were used on both [[Bovinae|bovine]]s and [[Equidae|equine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin W. Schwabe, 'Cattle, Priests and Medicine', Vol.4, at p. 16 (U. of Minn. 1978), {{ISBN|0-8166-0825-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
The nose ring assists the handler to control a dangerous animal with minimal risk of injury or disruption by exerting stress on one of the most sensitive parts of the animal, the nose.  Bulls, especially, are powerful and sometimes unpredictable animals which, if uncontrolled, can kill or severely injure a human handler.&lt;ref name=Albright&gt;[http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/vetext/INF-DA/INF-DA_CAREPRAX6.HTML Jack Albright, ''Why and how to read a cow or bull'', Hoard's Dairyman Magazine, W.D. Hoard and Sons Co., Fort Atkinson, Wis., (Nov. 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dairy Care Practices: Animal Care Series'', Dairy Workgroup University of California Cooperative Extension (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Show halter.jpg|thumbnail|A nose ring is used to maintain control of this [[bull]] being exhibited at a livestock show.]]

Control of the bull may be done by holding the ring by hand, looping a piece of rope through it, clipping on a bull staff.  A rope or chain from the ring may be attached to a bull's horns or to a [[Horse tack#Halters|head-collar]] for additional control.

With an aggressive bull, a short length of chain or rope may be left hanging loose from the ring, so when he ducks in a threatening manner, the bull will step on the chain and be deterred from attacking.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, William C., &amp; Robertson, Major E D S, ''Practical Animal Husbandry'' Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh, 7th ed, 1959: p 16&lt;/ref&gt;  This lead may also facilitate capture and control of a frisky bull.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Rebhun's diseases of dairy cattle |author=Thomas J. Divers, Simon Francis Peek |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbEWJrEtECIC&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and insertion==
Bull rings are usually about {{Convert|3|to|5|in|cm|0}} in diameter, depending on the size of the bull.  Bull rings are commonly made from aluminium, stainless steel or copper, in the form of a pair of hinged semicircles, held closed by a small [[brass]] bolt whose head is broken off during installation.  If a ring needs to be removed (for example, if the bull has grown out of it), it is cut or unscrewed.  

The ring is normally placed on the bull between 9 and 12 months of age.&lt;ref&gt;''Dairy Care Practices: Animal Care Series'', Dairy Workgroup University of California Cooperative Extension&lt;/ref&gt;  It is usually done by a [[veterinarian]], who pierces the septum with a [[scalpel]] or punch. Self-piercing rings (with sharp ends designed to be pressed through the septum and then pulled together with a screw) have been available for many years; these are also usually installed by a veterinarian rather than the owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifestyleblock.co.nz/articles/cattle/20_noseringing_bull.htm C. Dalton, ''Noseringing a Bull'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/vetext/INF-DA/INF-DA_CAREPRAX6.HTML ''Dairy Care Practices: Animal Care Series'', Dairy Workgroup University of California Cooperative Extension (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other designs==
===Calf-weaning ring===
Calf-weaning nose rings or nosebands provide an alternative to separating calves from their mothers during the weaning period. They have plastic spikes which are uncomfortable for the mother, causing her to reject the calf's efforts at suckling. Weaning nose rings are also available for sheep and goats. These nose rings (usually made of plastic) clip onto the nose without piercing it, and are reusable.
[[Image:XN Bos taurus 00.jpg|thumb|left|A spiked ring which prevents suckling]]

===Bulldogs===
Self-locking or spring-closing show-lead nose rings, also called "bulldogs" or nose grips, are removable rings that do not require the nose to be pierced. They are often used on steers and cows, along with a halter, at [[agricultural show]]s, or when handling cattle for examination, marking or treatment.  They stay shut until released, and usually have a loop for the attachment of a cord or [[lead rope]].  They give similar control to a bull ring without the need for permanent attachment.

===Bull tongs===
Bull-holders, also known as bull-tongs, have a pliers action and are used for short periods on grown cattle when they are being [[Cattle age determination|mouthed]] or drenched. A chain, rope or strap keeps the grips closed and may be passed over a bar at the front of a head bail to elevate the head.  The thumb and forefinger may also used in this way on smaller animals.

==Pig nose rings==
[[Image:Rung pig 2.JPG|thumb|right|Nose rings on a young pig foraging on the [[New Forest]]]]
[[Domestic pig#Rooting|Rooting]] is the act of a pig nudging into something with its snout, such as into the dirt to unearth plants to eat. In some circumstances, owners of pigs may find this undesirable.  Nose rings make rooting painful for the animal, although a ringed pig may still able to forage freely through leaf litter and surface vegetation.  Pig nose-ringing may sometimes be required by local regulations, as when [[livestock|farm]] pigs are released into public woods to [[pannage]] (such as on the [[New Forest]] in southern [[England]]).

Nose rings specifically designed for pigs usually consist of open copper or steel wire rings with sharp ends, about one inch (about 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter.  These are typically clipped to the rim of the nose instead of through the septum, as this is far more painful to the pig and is considered "thus more effective for deterring the pig from rooting than piercing through the septum is".  As they may sometimes become dislodged, an adult pig may be given three to four rings.

==Bull handling in the show ring==
For safety reasons, many show societies require bulls over 12 months to be led with a nose ring.   A bull may be led by a rope tied through the ring, although a [[halter]] (headcollar) is usually also used so as not to rely unduly on the nose ring for control. If the bull has horns, the lead rope may also be fastened around those and then passed down through the nose ring.  Some shows require other cattle to be led with nose grips (bulldogs). Several methods exist for handling a bull with a ring installed.  One method of leading a bull is to have one person on either side of the bull with both halter lead ropes through the ring, which prevents the bull from gaining pace and also from running into the handlers.&lt;ref&gt;Land Newspaper, Rural Press, Richmond, 20 March 2008 - p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Another practice is for one handler to use a rope and the other a bull-staff attached to the ring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buckscountyshow.co.uk/pdf/healthsafety.pdf Bucks County Agricultural Health and Safety Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bridgendshow.org.uk/health_safety_policy.html Bridgend County Show Health and Safety Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bull handling on the farm or ranch==
It is estimated that 42% of all livestock-related human fatalities are a result of bull attacks, and only about one in twenty victims of a bull attack survives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfa-fca.ca/upload/casw_livestock.pdf Canadian Farming Administration, ''Handling Livestock Successfully'', 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Dairy breed bulls are particularly dangerous and unpredictable; the hazards of bull handling are a significant cause of injury and death for dairy farmers in some parts of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/livestocksystems/DI0878.html Larry D. Jacobson, Extension Agricultural Engineer, ''Safe Work Practices on Dairy Farms'', University of Minnesota Extension Services (1989)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618112456/http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/livestocksystems/DI0878.html |date=2010-06-18 }}("During the last 10 years, 12 farmers in Minnesota were mauled and gored to death by dairy bulls").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cumberlink.com/articles/2008/02/12/shipp_news/news390.txt Cumberland County (Pa.)

Michelle Park, "Bull attacks, kills owner at South Heidelberg Township farm".&lt;/ref&gt;  Most cattle breeders recognize the importance of looking after expensive bulls that are expected to improve herds and profits. Nonetheless, the dangers of bull handling, particularly from dairy bulls in close quarters, are regularly proven by the obituaries.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' C. Parsons, ''Students Mourn Teacher: FFA Advisor Killed by Bull'', 81 Capital Press, No.38, page 1 (Sept. 19, 2008) (veteran agricultural instructor killed by a dairy bull after warning others not to enter pen)&lt;/ref&gt; Good bull management and safety practices require caution in handling beef and dairy bulls, and use of the nose ring and chain is a recommended precaution for modern farmers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nasd/docs/d001001-d001100/d001018/d001018.html Kerri Ebert and Michael Dennis, Pa.

Mills, ''Bulls on the Dairy Farm'', Kansas State University, Oct. 4, 2002 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in many regions, particularly in the beef industry, bulls do not have nose rings unless they are to be exhibited and they are generally driven about as other cattle would be.&lt;ref&gt;W A Beattie, ''Beef Cattle Breeding and Management'', Popular Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;   Cows with young calves can be particularly dangerous if protecting their young, and cattle in general, including calves, steers and bullocks, do cause many serious human injuries and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfa-fca.ca/upload/casw_livestock.pdf Cfa-fca.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/programs/extension/farm_safety/cow.html Serious Cattle-lnflicted Injuries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandin.com/behaviour/principles/principles.html Grandin.com. Injuries are caused by a steer or cow]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the use of both a ring and a halter, and management of the bull by two people, is the preferred method today for controlling the bull.   Typically, a bull was led by a wooden staff with a steel end that snapped into the ring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquefarmtools.info/USERIMAGES/270.JPG An example of a bull staff]&lt;/ref&gt; A long rigid steel or wooden bull staff locked into the ring could also be used to push a bull out of a pen without requiring the handler to enter the pen for cleaning or feeding.&lt;ref&gt;''The James Way'', The James Manufacturing Co., Ft. Atkinson, Wisc. (1914), at p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the risk that the bull may drive the staff into the handler if the bull misbehaves&lt;ref&gt;V G Cole, ''Beef Production Guide'', Livestock &amp; Grain Producers Association of NSW, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; many handlers prefer to avoid their use nowadays.  One current veterinary text still recommends the use of a staff in addition to the halter: &lt;blockquote&gt;Many handlers rely on a nose ring to control a bull.  But a ring in his nose is no good unless you have a bull staff and use it.  A bull staff is a pole with a snap in the end that clips to the bull ring.  Leading a bull with a staff gives you a lot more handling power as the bull can't get any closer to you than the length of the staff allows. Leading him only by a chain in the ring lets him run over you at will.&lt;ref name="C.E. Spaulding, D.V.M. 1998 p. 27"&gt;C.E. Spaulding, D.V.M. &amp; Jackie Clay, ''Veterinary Guide for Animal Owners'', Rodale Press, Inc., Emmaus, Pa. (2d ed. 1998), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most dairy or beef farms traditionally had at least one, if not several, bulls for breeding purposes.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Yearbook 1922, Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. (1922), pp. 325-28 (noting a national on-farm bull population of over 600,000 "scrub" bulls in addition to a multi-year supply of "pure bred" bulls)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O.C.

Clement, ''We Gotta Have More Jails'', The Writer's Club Press, New York (1984-87), at pp. 79-80. A humorous description of moving a cow to a neighbor's Jersey bull for breeding purposes, and the use of a 12-foot bull staff to get the loose-running bull under control after he had already spotted the cow&lt;/ref&gt; Being trampled, jammed against a wall or gored by a bull was one of the most frequent causes of death in the dairy industry prior to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;O.C.

[[Image:Brahman bulls.jpg|thumb|Bulls respond well to a good handler]]

When allowed outside his pen, the bull typically was kept in a halter connected by a strap snapped into the ring in his nose for ease of control.&lt;ref&gt;O.C. Gregg, Ed., ''Minnesota Farmer's Institute Annual'' '''15''', p. 126, Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minn. (1902)&lt;/ref&gt; In the bull pen, the use of a ring connected by a cable to a fixed point was recommended as a means of controlling and securing the bull while allowing a degree of movement by the subject bull.&lt;ref&gt;The James Way, The James Manufacturing Co., Ft. Atkinson, Wisc. (1930), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;  If the pen was strong enough, the bull could be turned loose, and if needed, placed in a stanchion.&lt;ref&gt;The James Way, The James Manufacturing Co., Ft. Atkinson, Wisc. (1914), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers who lacked an assistant, or a bull staff, had no choice but to adopt other means.  Some farmers elected to move their bulls by tying a rope to the ring and tying the other end of the rope to a farm [[tractor]], providing both motive power and a degree of protection from the angry bull.&lt;ref&gt;Sara De Luca, ''Dancing the Cows Home: A Wisconsin Girlhood'', Minn. Hist. Soc. Press, St. Paul, Minn. (1996) pp.99-100 (moving a heifer with a tractor)&lt;/ref&gt;  The efficacy of this technique is doubtful, and may depend on the size of the tractor and of the bull; one authority has "seen a bull lift the front end of a tractor like a toy".&lt;ref name="C.E. Spaulding, D.V.M. 1998 p. 27"/&gt;  Others used dogs and horses.  Not all farmers could afford specially designed and manufactured bull handling products, which were not readily available until the 1980s.  The experimental improvisation of techniques for bull handling, as in many aspects of [[family farm]]ing, was a common practice.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cotter &amp; B. Jackson, ''Voices of America: Growing Up on a Minnesota Farm'', Arcadia Publishing Co., Chicago, Ill.

The '''origins of the Kingdom of Alba''' pertain to the origins of the [[Kingdom of Alba]], or the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] [[Kingdom of Scotland]], either as a mythological event or a historical process, during the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]].

==Origin paradigms==
===Medieval version===
The conceptualisation of the past as the standard of the Middle Ages is perhaps best encapsulated by the [[German language|German]] term ''[[Völkerwanderung]]''. In this model, the Scots are portrayed as making their way from [[Egypt]]{{cn|date=June 2017}} via [[Ireland]] to Scotland, annihilating their enemies on the way. The legitimacy therefore derives from conquest, and purity of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]]/royal descent. The tradition in Scotland was influenced by the ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'' and the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''. Ultimately, such conceptualizations can be derived from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' and the [[Bible]], but were just as much an organic and original product of the medieval Scots themselves.

In the ''[[Life of St Cathróe of Metz]]'', the [[hagiography|hagiographer]] recounts the mythological origin of the saint's people, the Gaels. The hagiographer recounts that they landed in the vicinity of [[Cruachan Feli]] - called the ''Mountain of Ireland''. He recounts that the Gaels conquered Ireland after a series of battles with the [[Picts]] (here ''Pictanes''). They followed up their conquest of Ireland by invading Britain, conquering Iona before conquering the cities of ''Rigmonath'' (=''Cennrigmonaid''; i.e. [[St Andrews]]) and ''Bellathor'' (=''Cinnbelathoir''; an unidentified Scoto-Pictish [[palace]]). Afterwards, their commander - a Spartan called ''Nel'' (=Niall) - named the land and people after his Egyptian wife [[Scota]]. The tale is astonishingly important, because it dates to about 980, an extremely early date, and has Scottish sources. Indeed, the saint himself is Scottish, born of royalty. According to the ''Life'', he was educated in [[Armagh]], before returning to [[Scotland]] and entering the service of King [[Constantine II of Scotland|Constantine II]] (Causantín mac Áeda). Constantine gave Cathróe conduct to the court of King [[Dyfnwal I of Strathclyde|Dyfnwal]] of [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], and from there made his way to Viking England, and finally, the continent.{{ref|CathróeCitation}}

Medieval Scottish [[genealogy|genealogies]] trace the origin of the Scots to [[Fergus Mór mac Eirc]], the legendary founder of [[Dál Riata]]. The ''[[Senchus fer n-Alban]]'' also contains the myth of Fergus. This is an older document, perhaps dating to the seventh century, that has been heavily interpolated with later material, probably including the mythological parts. Appended to the ''Míniugud Senchasa Fher nAlba'' in many manuscripts is the ''[[Genelaig Albanensium]]'', a list of genealogies relating to Gaelic rulers of Scotland going up to at least Constantine III (995-7) (it goes later in some of the manuscripts). It is likely that this material was inserted into the  ''Míniugud'' in the early eleventh century.{{ref|MíniugudCitation}}

In the ''[[Duan Albanach]]'', this tradition is re-enforced. It is known to have been written in the reign of King [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]] (Máel Coluim mac Donnchada) (one line reads "Maelcoluim is now the king"). It recounts the earliest histories of the Picts, and then celebrates the conquest of the Picts by the ''Gaedhil''. It calls the Scottish Gaels the ''children of Conaire'' and the traces the descent of the Scottish kings from Fergus mac Eirc. It does not trace their descent any further, because in the manuscript the ''Duan Albanach'' follows from a companion piece, the ''[[Duan Eireannach]]'' (i.e. ''Irish Poem''), which had already recounted the history of the Gaels from [[Scythia]] via Egypt to Ireland.{{ref|DuanCitation}}

These mythical traditions are incorporated into the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], and in that document origins from Ireland are omitted for the first time. They were believed in the early modern period and beyond, and even King [[James I of England|James VI]] traced his origin to Fergus, saying, in his own words, that he was a "Monarch sprunge of Ferguse race".{{ref|JamesCitation}}

===Goth versus Gael===
The [[Goths|Goth]] versus [[Gael]] model was developed in the context of a vast cultural and linguistic chasm which existed in [[Scotland in the early modern era]], and was invented in the context of the [[Anglo-Scottish Union]] and the [[Jacobite risings]] in the eighteenth century. The model originates ultimately in the later [[Middle Ages]], when the [[West Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking subjects of the Scottish king began to think of themselves as Scots, and began the ethnic and cultural disassociation of Scottish and Gaelic, previously two identical concepts, by calling their own brand of English ''Scottis'' and renaming ''Scottis'' as ''[[Scottish Gaelic#From the Middle Ages to the end of Classical Gaelic education|Erse]]''. Also important was the impact of the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[Act of Union 1707|Union]]. [[Scots language|Scots]] imported English prejudices about the Irish Gaels, and in turn adapted them for the Scottish Gaels. {{ref|Goth1Citation}}

The Goth versus Gael debate centred on which part of Scotland's past is the more important, the Germanic or the Celtic. [[Germanicists]], or ''Gothicists'' as they are sometimes called, attempted to disassociate Gaels and Gaelic from the Scottish past. One extreme example was [[John Pinkerton]], who believed passionately that the people and language of [[lowland Scotland]] derived from a [[Gothic language|Gothic]] [[dialect]] spoken by the Picts. John Pinkerton even invented ancient tales to give substance to this fictional ancient people. The main thrust of the Germanicist model was destroyed in the nineteenth century when [[William Forbes Skene]] and others brought medieval Scotland into the frame of serious, recognisably modern scholarship. Nevertheless, this model has had a lot of impact on popular understandings of medieval [[Scottish history]]. It explains, for instance, why some popular historians believe that English became the language of [[Lowland Scotland]] in the reign of Malcolm III, owing to the influence of his wife, the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo]]-[[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Saint Margaret]], when in fact no such thing happened for another few centuries.{{ref|Goth2Citation}}{{Dubious|date=August 2011}}

==Origins==
===Gaelic and Pictish kings===
That Pictland had Gaelic kings is not in question. One of the earliest, if not the earliest, was [[Nechtan IV of the Picts|Nechtan mac Derile]], the son of a Gaelic lord named [[Dargart mac Finguine|Dargart]] and the Pictish princess [[Derile]].{{ref|NechtanCitation}} Pictish kings, moreover, were probably Gaelic-speaking poets. There exists a Gaelic elegy to the Pictish king, Bridei, Bili's son. The poem is attributed to his contemporary, [[Adamnan|Adomnán]] of [[Iona]], but this is tenuous. It is however probably contemporary, dating to the late 7th or early eighth century. Another poem, attributed to [[Riagail of Bangor]], celebrates the same ruler's victory of the [[Northumbrians]], at the [[Battle of Dun Nechtain]] on 20 May 685.{{ref|PictpoemCitation}}

In the early eighth century, the great King of the Picts was [[Oengus I of the Picts|Óengus mac Fergusa]], conqueror of Dalriada. It is possible, as has been pointed out by some linguists and historians, that Óengus and Fergus are just Gaelic versions of native Pictish names, namely, ''Onuist'' and ''Urguist'', the names recorded in one strand of the Pictish king lists.{{ref|UniustCitation}} However, these names are rare in the larger [[Brythonic languages|P-Celtic]] world, and largely out of place in the context of previous Pictish kings. Furthermore, an inscription relating to Causantín son of Fergus reads:

&lt;div class="notice spoilerbox"&gt;
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;div class="toccolours spoilercontents"&gt;
'' CV[…]NTIN/FILIUSFIRCU/S. &lt;br&gt;
(''Constantine son of Fergus'').{{ref|DupplinCitation}} &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
|}&lt;/div&gt;

This inscription is from the [[Dupplin Cross]], and was found in the heart of southern Pictland, near [[Forteviot]]. It dates from the late 8th or early ninth century. If the name in question really were the Pictish ''Urguist'', then it is odd that a contemporary Pictish description gave the Gaelic form, form beginning with the unmistakably [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] ''F''. {{ref|WatsonCitation}} It is thus likely that several of the later Pictish Kings spoke Gaelic as their first language.

===Fortriu to Moray===
[[Image:Forres sueno.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sueno's Stone]], located in [[Forres]], in the old kingdom of [[Fortriu]]. This gigantic probably post-Pictish monument marks some kind of military triumph.]]
The [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] historian Alex Woolf has recently put forward a  case for relocating the Kingdom of Fortriu north of the ''Mounth'' (the [[Grampian Mountains|Grampians]]). Previously, it had been located in the vicinity of Strathearn; but as Woolf pointed out, this is based on one passage saying that the ''Men of Fortriu'' fought a battle in Strathearn. This is an unconvincing reason, because there are two Strathearns - [[Strathearn|one in the south]], and [[Strathdearn|one in the north]] - and, moreover, every battle has to be fought outside the territory of one of the combatants. By contrast, a northern recension of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' makes it clear that Fortriu was north of the ''Mounth'', in the area visited by [[Columba]]. The case has to be accepted, and there can be little doubt that the core of Fortriu lay to the north of the Grampian Mountains - in Moray, Ross and perhaps Mar and Buchan too.{{ref|WoolfCitation}}

Relocating Fortriu north of the ''Mounth'' increases the importance of the Vikings. After all, the Viking impact on the north was greater than in the south, and in the north, the Vikings actually conquered and made permanent territorial gains.

===Pictland to Alba===

There remains the possibility that [[Alba]] is simply a [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] translation of the Pictish name for Pictland. Both the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and the [[Irish language|Irish]] use archaic words for ''Briton'' to describe the Picts. It is very likely therefore that the Picts did so themselves; or if they did not originally, they came to do so. In which case the Pictish for Pictland would have been either the same as their word for Britain, or an obsolete term. Alba was exactly this kind of word in [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]]. It is therefore plausible that ''Alba'' is simply a Gaelic translation. The name change is first registered at the very beginning of the tenth century, {{ref|AlbaCitation}}  not long before [[Constantine II of Scotland|Constantine II]] is alleged to have Scotticised the "Pictish" Church,{{ref|SCCitation}} and at the height of Viking raids. Later records, especially the [[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]] and other documents in the [[Poppleton Manuscript]], tell us that the Picts were simply conquered and annihilated by king [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Kenneth MacAlpin]] (Cináed mac Ailpín). This is the traditional explanation, and the one repeated by many historians.  The only thing which is certain is that before 900,  the ''Cruithentuath'' (Gaelic for Pictland), and perhaps Fortriu, became Gaelic-speaking Alba.

The '''Peking to Paris''' motor race was an [[automobile race]], originally held in 1907,  between [[Beijing|Peking]] (now Beijing), then [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] [[China]] and [[Paris]], [[France]], a distance of {{convert|14994|km}}.

The idea for the race came from a challenge published in the Paris newspaper [[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]] on 31 January 1907, reading:

:"''What needs to be proved today is that as long as a man has a car, he can do anything and go anywhere. Is there anyone who will undertake to travel this summer from Peking to Paris by automobile?''"

The race started from the French embassy in Peking on 10 June 1907. The winner Prince [[Scipione Borghese, 10th Prince of Sulmona|Scipione Borghese]] arrived in Paris on 10 August 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pekintoparis.com/2007/history.html|title=Peking to Paris Motor Challenge, 2007.

== 1907 teams ==
There were forty entrants in the race, but only five teams ended up going ahead with shipping the cars to Peking.  The race was held despite the race committee cancelling the race.

* '''[[Itala]]''', {{flagicon|Italy|1861}} [[Italy|Italian]], 7 litre engine, finished 1st, driven by Prince [[Scipione Borghese, 10th Prince of Sulmona|Scipione Borghese]] and [[Ettore Guizzardi]]
* '''[[Spyker]]''', {{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Netherlands|Dutch]], finished 2nd, driven by [[Charles Godard]] with [[Jean du Taillis]]
* '''[[Mototri Contal|Contal]]''', {{flagicon|France}} [[France|French]], did not finish, three-wheeler [[Cyclecar]], driven by [[Auguste Pons]]
* '''[[De Dion-Bouton|DeDion 1]]''', {{flagicon|France}} French, finished 3rd, driven by [[Georges Cormier]]
* '''[[De Dion-Bouton|DeDion 2]]''', {{flagicon|France}} French, finished 4th, driven by [[Victor Collignon]]

== The 1907 race ==
[[File:1907 Itala - bridge crash - Project Gutenberg etext 17432.jpg|thumb|Hazards of the road: Borghese &amp; Barzini's [[Itala]] having fallen through a bridge]]

There were no rules in the race, except that the first car to Paris would win the prize of a [[Wine bottle#Sizes|magnum]] of [[Mumm]] [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. The race went without any assistance through countryside where there were no roads or roadmaps.  For the race, [[camel]]s carrying fuel left Peking and set up at stations along the route, to provide fuel for the racers. The race followed a [[telegraph]] route, so that the race was well covered in newspapers at the time. Each car had one journalist as a passenger, with the journalists sending stories from the telegraph stations regularly throughout the race.

It was held during a time when cars were fairly new and the route traversed remote areas of [[Asia]] where people were not yet familiar with motor travel. The route between Peking and [[Lake Baikal]] had only previously been attempted on horseback. The race was won by Italian [[Prince Scipione Borghese]] of the [[Borghese]] family, accompanied by the journalist [[Luigi Barzini, Sr.]]  He was confident and had even taken a detour from [[Moscow]] to [[St Petersburg]] for a dinner which was held for the team, and afterwards headed back to Moscow and rejoined the race. The event was not intended to be a race or competition, but quickly became one due to its pioneering nature and the technical superiority of the Italians' car, a {{convert|7433|cc|abbr=on}} [[Itala]] 35/45 HP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museoauto.it/website/en/collezione/37-itala/108-itala-mod-3545-hp-pechino-parigi|title=ITALA mod. 35/45 HP (Pechino – Parigi)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330150647/http://www.museoauto.it/website/en/collezione/37-itala/108-itala-mod-3545-hp-pechino-parigi|archive-date=30 March 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=|work=museoauto.it|accessdate=9 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second in the race was Charles Goddard in the Spyker; he had no money, had to ask others for petrol, and borrowed his car for the race. He was arrested for fraud near the end of the race. Some of the other cars had difficulties in going up ravines, across mud, quicksand, and bridges across rivers not designed for vehicles. The Contal cyclecar became bogged down in the [[Gobi desert]] and was not recovered, with the crew lucky to be found alive by locals. Barzini published the book ''Peking to Paris'' in 1908&lt;ref&gt;[[s:it:La metà del mondo vista da un'automobile|Read the text on italian Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;, filled with hundreds of pictures.

== Re-enactments ==
[[File:1907 Itala - being pulled - Project Gutenberg etext 17432.jpg|thumb|The Itala being pulled across unnavigable terrain]]
Several races have been held to re-enact the event, including the [[1908 New York to Paris Race|Great Auto Race of 1908]] which raced from New York, west to Paris (by sea for part of the way). During most of the twentieth century other re-enactments could not be held, because of the establishment of the [[USSR]] after the 1917 [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s, racers were again allowed to race.

=== 1990 ===
In 1990 the [[London To Peking Motor Challenge]] was held, which raced in the opposite direction to the original race, from London to Beijing.

=== 1997 ===
In 1997 there was "The Second Peking to Paris Motor Challenge", consisting of 94 [[vintage car]]s, which took a more southerly route through Tibet, India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Greece, and Italy. It was won by the British pair Phil Surtees and John Bayliss, driving a 1942 [[Willys MB|Willys Jeep]].

=== 2005 ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
On 18 April 2005 a 1973 [[Fiat 500]] made it from [[Bari]], [[Italy]], to Beijing in a {{convert|16000|km|mi|sing=on}} journey across the whole of [[Russia]] and passing through [[Vladivostok]]. The route was partially similar to the original one. Driven for 100 days by [[Danilo Elia]] and Fabrizio Bonserio, the old and tiny car was followed along its journey by newspapers and television from all over the world. After the long journey, Elia wrote a book entitled ''La bizzarra impresa'' ({{ISBN|88-7480-088-6}}), in Italian, also available in German by the National Geographic Deutschland (''Echt Abgefahren'', {{ISBN|978-3-89405-834-0}}).

On 15 May 2005 five cars led by Lang Kidby departed Beijing for Paris, retracing the original route with very similar cars to the originals; a 1907 [[Spyker]], a 1907 and a 1912 [[De Dion-Bouton]], a 1907 [[Itala]], and a Contal Cycle-car replica. This journey was televised by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] in a four-part documentary series entitled ''Peking to Paris''. The show was hosted by [[Warren Brown (cartoonist)|Warren Brown]], one of two drivers on the Itala and a cartoonist with [[Sydney]] newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]''. The Australian team, driving westward, met the Italian Fiat 500, driving eastward, in an unplanned meeting, somewhere around [[Krasnojarsk]], Russia.

=== 2007 ===
In 2007 the [http://www.endurorally.com/ Endurance Rally Association] staged a [http://www.pekingparis.com/pp2007/index.html rally] to celebrate the centenary of the original 1907 race. Unlike the 1997 event, also staged by Philip Young, which took a southerly route, this event followed more faithfully the route taken by Prince Borghese in 1907 in the winning Itala. From Beijing, competitors went north to the Mongolian border at [[Zamyn-Üüd]] and, as with his original route, north to [[Ulan Bator|Ulaan Bataar]]. The route then went west across [[Mongolia]], crossing the Russian border at [[Tsagaannuur, Bayan-Ölgii|Tsagaannuur]] through Siberia to Moscow, on to St Petersburg (where Prince Borghese attended "a great banqet") and then through the [[Baltic states]] to finish in Paris. 
126 [[History of the automobile#Veteran era|veteran]], vintage, and [[classic car]]s took part, the oldest being a 1903 Mercedes. The major challenge of the rally proved to be Mongolia and the Gobi desert with no conventional roads, merely rutted tracks at best. Despite this 106 crossed the finishing line. The rally covered 12642 km in 36 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pekingparis.com/pp2007/route2007.html|title=Peking to Paris Motor Challenge - The Peking to Paris 2007 Route|last=|first=|date=|website=PekingtoParis.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


=== 2013 ===
The fifth race started at Beijing on 28 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peking to Paris Rally Briton killed in Siberia car crash|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22885146|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was for vintage cars and was to last 33 days. In the third week, the race was marred by the death of a British participant, 46-year-old mother-of-two Emma Wilkinson, in a head-on collision with a vehicle unconnected with the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three die in crash near Tyumen involving Peking to Paris rally car|url=http://en.sib.fm/news/2013/06/12/three-die-in-crash-near-tyu-involving-peking-to-paris-rally-car|publisher=[[Sib.fm]]|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monuments ==
[[File:ITALA 35 45 HP Monument in Kirov, Russia.jpg|thumb|The sculpture of Borghese's Itala in Kirov, Russia]]
In 2015, commissioned by [[Pirelli]] Kirov Tyre Plant, a monument to the Borghese's Itala was erected in [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Kirov]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kirov.aif.ru/culture/art/v_kirove_ustanovili_pamyatnik_avtoprobegu_pekin-parizh|title=В Кирове установили памятник автопробегу Пекин-Париж|last=|first=|date=|website=AiF Kirov|publisher=|language=Russian|trans-title=Monument commemorating 1907 Beijing-Paris rally opened in Kirov|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument commemorates the fact of Borghese's team making a stopover in [[Vyatka Governorate]].

==In adolescence==
[[Middle school]] and [[high school]] seems to be the place in which the queen bee syndrome is born.{{Explain|reason=If the syndrome in the workplace is the product of cultural influences, and not a clinical condition in a person, how can it stem from adolescence?|date=October 2018}}{{cn|date=October 2018}} Vicious [[bullying]] of teen girls can sometimes be found in the interactions of adolescent girls, often with the operations spearheaded by one individual, who has as of late been dubbed the "[[Queen bee (sociology)|queen bee]]."  In recent years, research has shown that adolescent girls form (often small) groups called cliques, which are often created based on a shared characteristic or quality of the members such as attractiveness or popularity. Association with such a group is often wanted by those who are part of the larger, all encompassing group, such as a class or school. It is the association with these groups that brings an individual similar treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Closson, L. M. (2009). Aggressive and Prosocial Behaviors Within Early Adolescent Friendship Cliques&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
A popular example of a movie based on girls with queen bee syndrome is the 2004 film, ''[[Mean Girls]]''. The authorized biographer of [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], stated in an interview his belief that the former British prime minister had herself suffered from the syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Somerset |first=Guy |title=Charles Moore interview |url=http://www.noted.co.nz/archive/listener-nz-2013/charles-moore-interview-the-extended-version/ |magazine=[[New Zealand Listener]] |accessdate=26 February 2017 |date=6 June 2013 |quote=Partly there was a genuine problem about the talent within the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory Party]] at that time – it was not great. But I think also she did suffer, as her critics say, from what they call the queen bee syndrome: she thought, 'I can do it, why can't others? It's not for me to fish around to find the right women, I'm just going to get the nearest good person to hand' ... All her comments, even as a young woman about other women in letters to [her sister] [[Muriel Cullen|Muriel]], tend to be competitive and sometimes quite critical. She didn't have much personal solidarity with women if they were also ambitious. She was very close to some women who were in subsidiary positions, such as her diary secretaries – she's extremely fond of them and very nice to them - but I don't think you'll find much closeness to any female equal. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227151552/http://www.noted.co.nz/archive/listener-nz-2013/charles-moore-interview-the-extended-version/ |archive-date=2017-02-27 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the workplace==
Recent research has postulated that queen bee syndrome may be a product of certain cultural influences,&lt;ref name=Derks2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1348/014466610X525280|pmid=21884548|title=Do sexist organizational cultures create the Queen Bee?|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=50|issue=3|pages=519–535|year=2011|last1=Derks|first1=Belle|last2=Ellemers|first2=Naomi|last3=Van Laar|first3=Colette|last4=De Groot|first4=Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Derks2011b&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0956797611417258|pmid=21873568|title=Gender-Bias Primes Elicit Queen-Bee Responses Among Senior Policewomen|journal=Psychological Science|volume=22|issue=10|pages=1243–1249|year=2011|last1=Derks|first1=Belle|last2=Van Laar|first2=Colette|last3=Ellemers|first3=Naomi|last4=De Groot|first4=Kim|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/487084|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially those related to the modern workplace.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} 

Researchers have hypothesized&lt;ref name=Derks2011b /&gt; that queen bee behavior may be developed by women who have achieved high workplace positions within their respective fields as a way to defend against any gender bias found in their cultures. By opposing attempts of subordinates of their own sex to advance in career paths, women displaying queen bee behavior try to fit in with their male counterparts by adhering to the cultural stigmas placed on gender in the workplace. Distancing themselves from female subordinates can allow for the opportunity to show more masculine qualities, stereotypically seen as more culturally valuable and professional. By showing these supposedly important masculine qualities, women displaying queen bee behavior seek to further legitimize their right to be in important professional positions as well as attaining job security by showing commitment to their professional roles.&lt;ref name=Derks2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Derks2011b /&gt;

{{About|secession in ancient Rome|other uses of secession|Secession (disambiguation)}}
'''Secessio plebis''' (''withdrawal of the commoners'', or ''Secession of the Plebs'') was an informal exercise of power by Rome's [[plebeian]] citizens, similar to a [[general strike]] taken to the extreme.  During a ''secessio plebis'', the [[plebs]] would simply abandon the city ''en masse'' and leave the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] order to themselves.  Therefore, a secessio meant that all shops and workshops would shut down and commercial transactions would largely cease.   This was an effective strategy in the [[Conflict of the Orders]] due to strength in numbers; [[plebeian]] citizens made up the vast majority of Rome's populace and produced most of its food and resources, while a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] citizen was a member of the minority upper class, the equivalent of the [[landed gentry]] of later times.   Authors report different numbers for how many secessions there were.  Cary &amp; Scullard state there were five between 494 BC and 287 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Secessions in Roman history==
===494 BC===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Aventine Secession (494 BC)]] --&gt;
{{Main|First secessio plebis}}
[[File:Secessio plebis.JPG|thumb|300px|The Secession of the People to the Mons Sacer, engraving by B. Barloccini, 1849.]]
Beginning in 495 BC, and culminating in 494&amp;ndash;493 BC, as a result of concerns about debt and the failure of the senate to provide for plebeian welfare, the plebeians on the advice of [[Lucius Sicinius Vellutus]] seceded to the [[Monte Sacro|Mons Sacer]] (''the Sacred Mountain''). As part of a negotiated resolution, the patricians freed some of the plebs from their debts and conceded some of their power by creating the office of the [[Tribune of the Plebs]]. This office was the first government position held by the plebs, since at this time the office of consul was held by patricians solely. Plebeian Tribunes were made personally [[sacrosanct]] during their period in office.

===449 BC===
The Second Secessio Plebis of 449 BC was caused by the abuses of a commission of the decemviri (ten men) and involved demands for the restoration of the plebeian tribunes (the representatives of the plebeians) and of the right to appeal, which had been suspended.

In 450 BC Rome decided to appoint the commission of the decemviri which was tasked with compiling a law code (which became the Law of the [[Twelve Tables]]). The commission was given a term of one year, during which the offices of state were suspended. The decemviri were also exempted from appeal. In 450 BC they issued a set of laws, but did not resign at the end of their term and became abusive. They killed a soldier who had been a plebeian tribune and who criticised them. One of the decemviri, [[Appius Claudius Crassus]], tried to force a woman, [[Verginia]], to marry him. To prevent this, her father stabbed her and cursed Appius Claudius Crassus. This sparked riots which started with the crowd which witnessed the incident and spread to the army which was encamped outside the city. The people went to the Aventine Hill. 

The senate tried to get the decemviri to resign, but they refused. The people decided to withdraw en masse to Mons Sacer like in the first secession. The senate blamed this on the decemviri and managed to force them to resign. It sent two senators, Lucius Valerus Potitus and Marcus Horatius Barbatus, to Mons Sacer to negotiate. The people demanded the restoration of the plebeian tribunes and the right to appeal, which had been suspended during the term of the decemviri. This was agreed and they returned to the Aventine Hill and elected their tribunes.

Lucius Valerius Potitus and Marcus Horatius Barbatus became the consuls (the two annually elected heads of the Republic) for 449 BC. They introduced new laws which strengthened the rights of the plebeians. The lex Valeria Horatia de plebiscìtis provided that the laws passed by the Plebeian Council were binding of all Roman citizens (that is, both patricians and plebeians) despite  patrician opposition to laws passed by this assembly being binding on them. However, after being passed, these laws had to receive the approval of the senate (auctoritas patrum). This meant that the senate could veto the laws passed by the plebeians. Lex Valeria Horatia de senatus consulta ordered that the senatus consulta (the decrees of the senate) had to be kept in the temple of Ceres by the plebeian aediles, the assistants of the plebeian tribunes. This meant that the plebeian tribunes and aediles had knowledge of these decrees (previously they were kept secret). This put them in the public domain. Previously, the consuls had been in the habit of suppressing or altering them.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 3.55.13 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The lex Valeria Horatia de provocatio forbade the creation of offices of state which were not subject to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

===445 BC===
The third secession is alluded to by [[Florus]] ([[Lex Canuleia]]).

===342 BC===
This fourth secession is noted by [[Livy]]. The [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]] calls this an "obscure military revolt".

===287 BC===
In 287 BC, the plebs seceded a final time to the Janiculum to force the patricians to adopt the [[Lex Hortensia]], which gave [[Concilium Plebis|plebiscites]] the force of law.

'''Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko'''  ({{lang-ru|Серге́й Макарович Крамаренко}}) (born 23 April 1923) is a Soviet Air Force officer who fought in the [[Eastern Front of World War II|World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. For his service in Korea became a holder of the Title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. He achieved several high command positions in the USSR and was also Air Force advisor in Iraq and Algeria in the 1970s. Retired in 1977 with the rank of major-general, he lives with his family in Moscow.

==Childhood and encounter with aviation==
Sergei Kramarenko was born on 23 April 1923 in the village of Kalinovka in [[Sumy Oblast]], [[Ukraine]], the eldest of three sons of Makar Kramarenko and Nadezhda Galkovskaya. His parents were divorced when he and his brothers were still children and he went with his mother and brothers to live first in the Caucasus, and later to a [[kolkhoz]] (collective farm) near the [[Volga river]].

During the 1930s the young Kramarenko listened to radio broadcasts about the deeds of Soviet airmen like [[Valery Chkalov]] and [[Georgiy Baidukov]], and so decided to become a pilot. In the autumn of 1940 he began a flying course at the [[Dzerzhinsky, Moscow Oblast|Dzerzhinsky]] aeroclub, and as one of the 80 who graduated with the highest marks was offered the opportunity to become a military pilot. Kramarenko accepted and began military training on 1 April 1941 at [[Borisoglebsk]] aerodrome.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov y Seybrov: V Nebe Dvukh Voyn" (Against Messers and Sabres: In the Sky of Two Wars", Chast (Part) I, pp.1-20. EKSMO, Moskow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==The German-Soviet War (1941-45)==
Sergei Kramarenko first saw action in late November 1942 over [[Stalingrad]], as part of the 523rd IAP- equipped with the [[LaGG-3]]. Like most inexperienced fliers, he began as wingman to more experienced pilots, such as Capt. Mikhail Baranovskiy and Lt. Yury Ryzhov. In early 1943 his unit was re-equipped with the [[Lavochkin]] [[La-5]], which performance-wise proved to be on a par with the German [[Fw 190]] and [[Bf 109]].

===First aerial victory===
On 23 February 1943 he was flying as wingman in a flight led by Capt. Baranovskiy when they engaged a group of dive-bomber [[Ju 87 Stuka]]s. Several escorting Fw 190s jumped his element leader Ryzhov and he promptly rushed to assist:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In that moment in front of me, with a left turn at 100-150 meters arrived two unknown aircraft of green color - in their fuselages were black crosses. In spite it was the first time I saw them, immediately I knew they were two Fw 190s. As soon as they finished their turn, one of them began to shoot at my leader. I opened fire against the trailing airplane and I saw shell strikes all over the aircraft. I watched that suddenly it went upwards turning, and his leader after him.
Right then, ahead of me from the left went by tracers. I looked to the left and saw that 300 meters behind at the left were two Focke-Wulfs. They shoot right at me, and the tracers of their aircraft get closer and closer to my airplane. What should I do? To climb was impossible, because there were two more Focke-Wulfs. Immediately broke to the left, underneath the tracers. I dove [...]
Many years later, while I described this episode to a journalist friend of mine, he told me that he saw in German memoirs a report of the leader of that ''Schwarm''. [...] After the combat with me, while returning home, one of his pilots, because of unexplainable reasons, got into a dive and crashed into the ground. I realized that one of the shells of my cannons hit the pilot's cockpit and wounded the pilot, who because of the loss of blood fainted and crashed to his death.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov: V Nebe Dvukh Voyn", Chast I, pp.42-44. EKSMO, Moscow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kramarenko's first victory claim was Fw 190A-3 (WkNr 2265) of ''Oberfeldwebel'' Karl Stadeck, (of 2./[[JG 51]] "Mölders"), who was killed. He claimed while flying Lavochkin La-5 "Red 34".&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko and Milos Sedivy, "Lovec", Svet Krídel, Prague, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downed, wounded, captured and rescued===

On 19 March 1944 three [[La-5#Flying the La-5|La-5FN]]s of the 19th IAP intercepted a group of [[Ju 88]] bombers escorted by six [[Bf 110]] fighters. Kramarenko's leader - Pavel Maslyakov - shot down one of the Junkers, but was in return jumped by one of the Bf 110s. Kramarenko was ready to cover him, scoring hits on the Messerchmitt. He then fell prey to the Bf 110 wingman, who set his aircraft on fire and forced him to bail out with severe burns to face and hands.

Kramarenko was captured almost immediately by German troops, and as he was unwilling to answer the questions of his SS interrogator he was to be executed. Fortunately for Kramarenko the order was cancelled at the last minute by a Wehrmacht General, who ordered also that Kramarenko be sent to a German field hospital. Two weeks later Kramarenko was rescued by Soviet troops liberating the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov: V Nebe Dbukh Voyn", Chast I, pp.65-71. EKSMO, Moskow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service in Kozhedub's 176th GIAP===
After several months of convalescence in a Moscow burns hospital, he returned to his regiment (now redesignated 176th GIAP). Kramarenko was appointed wingman to the Regiment navigator Major Aleksandr Kumanichkin, already an ace with 35 aerial victories ( he claimed five more in Korea). Both men were aggressive and disciplined in the air and they became a lethal team. He flew Kumanichkin's wing for several of the ace's victories, and shared some of them. On 16 April 1945 Kramarenko scored his second full victory: a Fw 190 over Eastern Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov: V Nebe Dvukh Voyn", Chast I, pp.85-122. EKSMO, Moskow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft he flew that day was the [[Lavochkin La-7]] "Red 27", of the regimental executive officer Major [[Ivan Kozhedub]]. Kozhedub had lent Kramarenko his aircraft because he was not scheduled to fly and no other aircraft was available.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko and Milos Sedivy, "Lovec", Svet Kridél, Prague, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Post War and the beginning of the Cold War (1945-50)==
In 1946 the 176th GIAP was redeployed to the aerodrome of [[Tyoply Stan District|Tyoply Stan]] on the south-west outskirts of Moscow and was among the first units to receive the new prop-driven [[La-9]], the jet-propelled [[La-15]], and in late 1949 the [[MiG-15]]. Already the ''zamkomesk'' (Замкомэск, '''зам'''еститель '''ком'''андира '''эск'''адрильи = ''zamestitel komandir eskadrilii'' = deputy squadron leader) of the regiment's 3rd AE of [[Aleksandr Vasko]], Капитан (''Kapitan'' = Captain) Kramarenko flew the MiG-15 during the 1950 May Day fly-past over the [[Kremlin]] and [[Red Square]], and on 14 August over Tushino airbase (for  Air Force Day ).

==The Korean War (1950-53)==
In early October 1950 the 176th GIAP were called to a meeting in the Officers' Club at Tyoply Stan by General Redkin, the Executive Officer of the Air Defense of Moscow, with [[Vasily Stalin]] (son of [[Joseph Stalin]]) also attending. Redkin detailed the critical situation in [[North Korea]], with American [[B-29]] heavy bombers bombing the poorly defended North Korean cities. The Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Korea]] had officially requested Soviet assistance. When asked for volunteers all pilots, including Kramarenko, raised their hands. The unit was soon deployed to Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov. V Nebe Dvukh Voyn", Chast II, p.154. EKSMO, Moscow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet involvement would be a secret until well after the end of the [[Cold War]].

Travelling across [[Siberia]], Kozhedub's 324th IAD (made up of the 176th GIAP and 196th IAP) arrived in the city of [[Dunfyn]], where they were given Chinese uniforms to wear. The Soviet fliers received their first salary in Chinese currency which they spent at local markets, buying civilian clothing to replace the Chinese uniforms. An intense period of air-to-air training in the [[MiG-15]] followed. The Russians trained alongside Chinese pilots in the nearby airbase of [[Mukden]]. Kozhedub brought Kramarenko with him and personally checked the training of their Chinese and Korean apprentices. Kramarenko remembered the poor training of the Chinese students who could barely perform even basic training flights. Both he and Kozhedub also realized the meager diet of rice they received was a problem. As soon as the Chinese rations were replaced by meat and other high-calorie food the situation improved.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov. V Nebe Dvukh Voyn", Chast II, p.158. EKSMO, Moscow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===First victories===
Both regiments of the 324th IAD redeployed to the forward airbase at [[Dandong Langtou Airport|Antung]], and entered into battle in early April 1951. On 3 April they suffered three losses for no victories, although on 4 April 1951 Fiodor Shebanov managed to shoot down an [[F-86]] and the pilot captured&lt;ref&gt;Leonid Krylov and Yuriy Tepsurkayev, "Soviet MiG-15 Aces of the Korean War", Chapter 2, Osprey Publishing Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;).

Kramarenko noted that the main reason for such a defeat was their failure to enter Korean airspace at higher altitude and superior speed in comparison with American aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov. V Nebe Dvukh Voyn", Chast II, p.164. EKSMO, Moscow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yevgeny Pepelyaev]] (196th IAP's commander) and [[Sergei Vishnyakov]] (176th GIAP's executive officer) instructed the MiG pilots to jump the American formations in co-ordinated attacks from different directions.&lt;ref&gt;Igor Seydov and German Askold, "Krasnye Dyavoly na 38-y Paralleli&lt;/ref&gt; Now with these coordinated attacks and both height and high speed the MiG-15 fliers had combat conditions in their favor.

These tactics were tested on 12 April 1951 when 44 MiG-15s of the 176th GIAP and 196th IAP faced an American formation made up of 48 B-29s escorted by 96 jet fighters. Against these uneven odds the Soviet fliers claimed some 10 B-29s, 3 [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|F-80s]], and 1 [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86]] shot down. Kramarenko's first victory in Korea was the F-80C of Captain A. B. Swanson (18th ABG).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Kramarenko's second victory in the Korean sky occurred on 2 June, as he recalls:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In such conditions (on 2 and 17 June [1951] I managed to shoot down some Sabres. For example, reminded me the following combat: We flew in a ''zveno'' [a flight, a 4-airplanes formation] in the area assigned to patrol, having performed some circuits, when we spotted a group of eight Sabres, heading in a head-on course. We maneuvered to gain altitude and turned around to attack them from the rear hemisphere, but the Sabres spotted us and turned around too. A quartet kept on flying straight, and I with a dive began to chase the aircraft of the rearmost quartet. Two Sabres went to left, and two to the right; Lazutin's pair attacked the pair on the left, and went towards the right. The Sabres began to dive, but by then the range had decreased, and at about 400 meters I open fire. I see hits all over the Sabre wingman, which releasing smoke kept on diving. My wingman jumped the second Sabre, but his aircraft began to shake, due to the speed had almost reached 1.000 km/h, and consequently missed. We got out of the dive, and we saw that below remained only one Sabre - no trace of the second. Soon the ground control confirmed us, that he fell.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov. V Nebe Dvukh Voyn", Chast II, p.183. EKSMO, Moscow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His victory was probably confirmed by the interception of American radio dialogue: the F-86A Bu.No 49-1130 of Thomas C. Hanson ([[336th Fighter Squadron|336th FIS]], Killed), although USAF records list the aircraft as lost in an accident shortly after take-off.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko and Milos Sedivy, "Lovec", Svet Kridél, Prague, 2008 and [http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/pmkor/korwald_date.htm KORWALD]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clash of Titans===
On 17 June 1951 Kramarenko and his six wingmen almost fell in an American ambush when they engaged eight Sabres who were acting as bait for three more F-86s lying in wait and ready to attack from above. What follows is Kramarenko's account of the duel he had against an American ace of World War II:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Then the Sabres changed to another tactic. Individual pairs of their most experienced pilots would sit off to the side, and when combat was joined would pounce on the trailing aircraft of our group, and frequently shoot them down. [...]
 
My flight was flying to reinforce the strike group in the lead battle. As we got to the place of combat, the enemy were just finishing up moving out over the sea. Our side was also running out of fuel, and they were heading for home. As we got there, we could see an eight of Sabres coming right at us at the same altitude. Without thinking, I gave the command “Let’s attack them” and turned at a nearly 90 degree bank to wind up 600 meters behind this group. It was just as I got the leader in my sights and gave him a burst that I got a sensation of that something was behind me. That sensation made me turn right and look behind me, and what it was I do not know to this day. Perhaps I had seen something. But inexplicable as it was, there I now saw less than 100 meters behind me the huge nose of a Sabre and the blasts and tracers of its six machine guns firing at me. Without thinking, in the space of a few hundredths of a second I reacted automatically, and my MiG momentarily did a half roll, dropping into a dive. While in the dive, I looked back and saw a group consisting of three Sabres right behind me in a dive.  [...]

I could have initiated a dive, but I have been told that the Sabre was heavier than the MiG, so it should dive better. Because of that, to dive wasn't an option. Then I saw right in front of me a cluster of saving clouds. My only choice was to head my aircraft towards one of them. Once inside the cloud, I made a very sharp turn of 90° to the left, I got out of the clouds and performed a right turn. I supposed that the lead Sabre would thought that my MiG kept on diving straight after getting out of the cloud. And that was exactly what happened. Now, below me, there were these three Sabres, which were looking for me downwards. Without losing not even a second, I jumped them. I have turned the wits. Now it was my turn to attack.
But somehow they spotted me and immediately they split: the wingmen performed a diving turn to the left, and the leader a climbing right turn. This tactic allow them to neutralize my attack and to transform me into their prey: it was a trap. Whichever one I attacked, I would be forced to turn my tail to the others and then they would get me under fire. What was I to do? I could climb up and give battle, but I did not want to get into this interesting and advantageous situation: if you are going to do battle with strong pilots, with the Sabre wing commander, you had better be in a better position.

It is true that they were 3, but it didn't matter to me: I was very self-confident in my skills and my MiG. But now, I should decide fast who I shall to attack. Should I attack the pair which was diving, or the Sabre which was climbing? If I would jumped the first ones, the latter would dive after me and he would shoot me down. That's why I choose the later, because it was closer and was making a climbing turn to the right. So, I dived and soon I put myself behind him, I aimed, and at a distance of about 600 meters, I opened up. To slow down and to hold my fire until to be closer it was impossible, because the two remaining Sabres could catch me. My shells struck the Sabre. Evidently, some of the projectiles should hit it close to the engine, because the aircraft began to leave a trail of dark-gray smoke. The Sabre began to descend, and later entered in a steep dive.

I could not see all the fall, because when I looked back, I saw a couple of Sabres at 500 meters. A little bit more, and both would open fire with their 12,7 mm (0,50") machineguns.
Evidently, that was when I made a mistake. I should increase my angle of climbing and drag the Sabres to high altitude, where the MiG had the advantage. But I came to that conclusion only a long time later. At that time I reversed my heading, passed over the Sabres and in a slight dive I led my aircraft to a small group of clouds. Once there I turned to the right and went I got out of them, I started a ‘Boyevoy Razvorot [‘Combat Turn’, a climbing turn with a roll angle of 40-50°] to the left, but I didn’t found the Sabres below where I expect them to be, but behind at my left. [...]

I threw my aircraft in a dive, but instead of a sharp pull-up into a climb I began to slowly roll my aircraft into a flat dive. The Sabres, who didn’t expect that, stayed in the height, far above and behind.

I dived to the right towards the hydroelectric station over the Yalu river [this station is referred in the Russian cartography as Suphun hydroelectric station, and as Suiho Dam/Reservoir in the American one – Note of the authors]. This huge reservoir had a dam of 300 meters height and a power station which provided energy not only to half of Korea but also the whole North-East of China. Precisely it was the main target we should protect. Besides us, their defense consisted in a dozen of anti-aircraft batteries, which had the order to shoot at any airplane which get closer to the dam.

I had the hope that the gunners of these batteries would help me to get these Sabres out of my tail. And that was what happened: the gunners accomplished their order to open fire at any intruder, and in front of me it appeared a dark cloud caused by the detonation of the anti-aircraft shells. I didn’t want to evade that cloud, because the Sabres would reduce the distance and they would shoot me down. At that moment I preferred to eventually die in the hands of my fellow gunners, rather than the bullets of the Sabres, so I headed for the very center of a cloud. The aircraft punched into the cloud. Once inside and away from the shell bursts I immediately swung the aircraft from side to side, up and down. Grabbing the stick, I pulled back on it. The results were that the wings fluttered a bit.

But after several tens of seconds passed, suddenly I was once again out in the sunshine. The aircraft had punched through the black cloud. Behind and below me were the dam and the reservoir. Off to the left I could see the departing Sabres, having lost me in the cloud and perhaps figured I was dead. Following me had proven to be useless, the sea was near, and not wanting a new fight, even though I had come close to passing out from the stress. In order to not lose consciousness I focused my attention in front of me and pinched the arteries in my neck, as I did not want the blood to leave my head. It was far easier for the Sabre pilots to take this stress – they had a special anti-G suit which, when it sensed increased stress on the pilot, filled with air and, grasping him tightly, prevented the blood from leaving his head. Up until then our designers had never thought of such an idea.

I circled the airfield a couple of times, landed and then, taxiing over to the hardstand, saw my wingmen. They, having lost me during the sharp turn, continued to go after the eight Sabres, but when they got to the coastline had to turn back, searched for me, and not finding me, returned to the airfield.

Subsequent examination of my gun camera footage showed good hits on the Sabre. Ground command reported where it had impacted.”&lt;ref&gt;Sergey Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov: V Nebe Dvukh Voyn", Chast II, pp.184-190, EKSMO, Moscow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Sabre downed by Kramarenko was the F-86A BuNo 49-1281 of Lt.Col. [[Glenn T. Eagleston]] ([[4th Operations Group|4th FIG's]] commander, a famed World War II ace with 18.5 Luftwaffe kills while flying a [[P-51 Mustang]], and two victories against MiGs in Korea), who belly-landed his jet at [[Gimpo International Airport|Kimpo Airbase]] South Korea. The jet was damaged beyond repair and was written off.&lt;ref&gt;Warren E. Thompson and David R. McLaren, "MiG Alley, Sabres vs MiGs over Korea", Appendix B, p.172, Specialty Press, 2002 -the date mentioned, 25 June 1951, is wrong. Bruce Hinton provide the actual date for the battle -17 June 1951- in Larry Davis, "The 4th Fighter Wing in the Korean War", Chapter 4, pp.59-61, Schiffer Military History, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the two Sabres who came to assist Eagleston was also a notable combat pilot: Lt.Col. Bruce Hinton, the first Sabre pilot to shoot down a MiG on 17 December 1950.

===First jet-vs-jet ace in history===
Kramarenko's streak of successes continued during June and July. On the 23rd he was credited with another F-86 kill (although records show no Sabre was lost that day). On 11 July the 176th GIAP engaged a group of Sabres escorting F-80s, while the 196th IAP intercepted the fighter-bombers. While leading six MiG-15bis Kramarenko engaged a flight of six Sabres, and at 300 meters shot down one F-86 which was seen to crash south-west of Tetsuzan, the pilot ejecting into the sea.&lt;ref name="KORWALD"&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/pmkor/korwald_date.htm KORWALD]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 1951 sixteen MiG-15bis of the 176th GIAP relieved other MiGs of the 17th IAP which were tangling with Sabres. Kramarenko's flight was among them, and flying at 14,000 meters he spotted two F-86s at 10,000 meters. A single burst at 250 meters sent one of them downwards out of control.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Igor Seydov and Askold German, "Krasnye Dyavoly na 38-y Paralleli", EKSMO, Moscow, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy 37 and 23&amp;nbsp;mm shells from Kramarenko's MiG-15bis destroyed the rudder and elevators of the F-86A BuNo 49-1098 (4th FIW) and its pilot managed to reach South Korea where he bailed out safely.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Davis, "4th Fighter Wing in the Korean War", Chapter 6, p.87, Schiffer Military History, 2001; and [http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/pmkor/korwald_date.htm KORWALD]&lt;/ref&gt; This was Kramarenko's fifth victory. Sergei Kramarenko was the actual first ace of the Korean War, and due to the fact that all his victims were jets, the first jet-vs-jet ace in history.&lt;ref&gt;Diego Zampini, "Red Stars over North Korea", Flieger Revue, Xtra 22, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hero of the Soviet Union===

The 324th IAD had been fighting without a respite since April. During August it was allowed to rest for a month. When the unit came back into the fight, Kramarenko soon claimed new victories:

* 12 September 1951: he got credit for an F-80 kill,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; in fact the [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|F-84E]] BuNo 49-2399 of Captain Chapman ([[136th Airlift Wing|136th FBW]]), who managed to reach [[Korea Bay]] and eject there.&lt;ref name="KORWALD"/&gt;
* 22 September 1951: he claimed a Sabre. In actuality he had seriously damaged the F-86A BuNo 49-1158 (4th FIW), but this jet survived and could be salvaged.&lt;ref name="KORWALD"/&gt;
* 30 October 1951: one more jet was claimed - the F-84E BuNo 51-615 of the 49th FBW (the unnamed flier was rescued).

Kramarenko was postulated to be awarded the ''Zolotaya Svezda'', which is given with the title of ''Geroy Sovietskogo Soyuza'' ([[Hero of the Soviet Union]]). He was finally decorated with this award on 10 November 1951 by the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, [[Nikolay Shvernik]]. On his return to the skies over Korea, Kramarenko kept on scoring victories:

* 1 December 1951: he claimed two [[Gloster Meteor]]s of [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF]], the seriously damaged Meteor F.8 S/N A77-559 of Flight Sergeant Bill Middlemiss, and the shot-down Meteor F.8 S/N A77-251 of Pilot Officer Vance Drummond RAAF, who bailed out and was captured.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Kramarenko and Milos Sedivy, "Lovec", Svet Krídel, Prague, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He could also have shot down one more fighter that day. He pulled behind and within firing range of a third Meteor, the pilot of which was completely unaware of his presence. But at that point Kramarenko showed his humanity: he felt that the air battle was already over, he and his team had won, and he felt that there was no need to draw more blood that day. Consequently, he ordered his wingman Ikar Gulyy to disengage and to leave the unknown Australian flier alone.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov. V Nebe Dvukh Voyn", Chast II, pp.195-198, EKSMO, Moscow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* 12 January 1952: he was credited with two F-86 kills in two separate engagements. The first claim matches with a US aircraft lost - F-86E BuNo 50-615 of Paul G. Ridgeway ([[334th Fighter Squadron|334th FIS]]), though the USAF records credit it to an "engine failure".&lt;ref name="KORWALD"/&gt;
* 16 January 1952: Kramarenko scored his last confirmed victory over Teiju, a F-86 which then crashed near the village of Un-Denri.&lt;ref&gt;TsAMO RF 176th GIAP ‘Zhurnal uchyota boevykh vyletov’ za period s 23.12.1951–30.01.1952, Opus 539889s, delo 5, p.15-19; and [http://www.korean-war.com/sovietunion.html Russian Claims of the Korean War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101081848/http://www.korean-war.com/sovietunion.html |date=2006-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramarenko recalled this victory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"After takeoff and climb to altitude we saw the entire sky was filled with moving dots. We dropped our tanks and hit the throttles, and our MiGs went into combat. Immediately the regiment broke up into several groups and pairs. I and my six were following the group commander’s flight, which were attacking a group of Sabres flying an intersecting course from below the Sabres. At that moment his group found itself under attack from a flight of Sabres. I gave the command to my wingman to repulse the attack, and we proceeded to cut through their flight. A long burst in front of the Sabres forced them to break off the attack and climb away. I gave the command to Lazutin to go after them, while I and my wingman turned to follow the group commander, who had opened fire as he closed on the Sabres, but they made a sharp maneuver to avoid his fire and split up. One flight went into steep left bank, and the other did the same to the right. Vishnyakov’s flight split up as well and began to go after both groups as pairs. At that moment his pair was jumped from above by a pair of Sabres, who literally popped up about 300-400 meters from me. I immediately went over to get on their tails. The Sabres rolled over and went into a dive. I ordered Gogolev, my third pair leader, “Cover the commander,” and tried to go after the Sabres. I could see that the Sabres were holding a dive at an angle of about 60 degrees – I aimed at them and immediately gave one of them a burst. I saw the shells detonate in the area of the cockpit, and there was clearly black smoke now visible inside the cockpit; the Sabre’s dive angle increased and he kept ongoing down. At that moment, Gulyy called me:
-I’m spinning! 
I looked behind me and saw his aircraft nearly inverted. I gave the command: 
-Hit your air brakes! Pull out!
I saw Gulyy pull out of the inverted position and we then went into a dive, climbed back up to altitude, and returned home. [...]

Fifty years later a special group carrying out a search for American pilots who were missing in action asked me if the pilot of the Sabre I shot down had bailed out. I could only repeat what I wrote above.”&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov. V Nebe Dvukh Voyn", Chast II, pp.202-203, EKSMO, Moscow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The USAF reported no Sabre loss on that date, but the fact that the US-Russia Joint Commission for POW-MIA interviewed him in 2002 looking for details on this kill indicates that this victory is unofficially admitted by the Americans. {KORWALD shows a ''F-80C'' loss with the Pilot MIA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/pmkor/korwald_info_734.htm KORWALD]&lt;/ref&gt;}

===Shot down===

On 17 January 1952 Kramarenko flew his last combat mission in Korea. During it he damaged an F-86, but was not only shot down himself but also fired upon by the Sabre flier while he was hanging defenseless in his parachute. He himself describes the events:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“17 January was a heavy day for me. The radar station picked up the approach of a group of ground attack aircraft on their way to Anju. Our regiment was sent out to repulse them. Arriving in the area of combat operations, we just spotted the last group of Thunderjets sliding along above the clouds to our south. Vishnyakov went to go after them, but we were not able to attack as the Thunderjets went into a cloud and we found ourselves over the coastline. 
Not seeing the usual Sabre escort, we made a left turn and began a level climb and had just turned around when I spotted two groups of Sabres diving down to attack Vishnyakov. We were engaging under the most unfavorable conditions, but nevertheless we beat off the first attack of the Sabres and, by using maneuver, climbed back up to about 9000 meters. At that moment another group of Sabres showed up, and moved to come down to attack the regimental commander’s group from above. As for me, as I virtually had no speed due to the climb, managed to increase my climb angle and at 600 meters I opened fire on the Sabre group leader. His aircraft ran through my tracers, and I saw several explosions on it. He increased his dive and angle and headed down. Turning around, I saw that my group was also being attacked from above by a group of Sabres. I gave the command: “Everybody break!” and we turned under the Sabres, but now I saw that my rear wingman, Senior Lieutenant Voronoy, was being fired on by two Sabres. Voronoy went into a sharp dive and headed down. I returned to the battle. At that moment my third pair came under attack from two Sabres coming down from above which, as they opened fire, cut through them and headed out directly towards above me. I followed them, firing at the wingman. He, evidently damaged, turned and banked over into a dive. 
I was not able to go after the damaged aircraft, as I suddenly felt a sharp blow and the aircraft around me began to rapidly spin. I kicked hard left rudder, but the controls did not respond. It was so sudden that one wing suddenly broke off. I made the decision to bail out of the uncontrollable aircraft, as it was now in a vertical spin downward. With a great deal of difficulty – as I was rammed into the left side of the aircraft – I managed to get my hand on the ejection seat control lever and pull it. A sharp blow momentarily pressed down on my eyes, so I have no idea how I flew out of the aircraft. As I came back to life I was falling together with the seat, I released the harness and kicked out of the seat with my legs. I could see that the clouds below me were coming up rapidly, so I pulled on the parachute ripcord ring, and after I yanked it the canopy opened. I came to a sharp halt, and now I was floating under the parachute. 
Above me was the blue sky, below me the clouds. They were about 800 meters below. I glanced around and saw a Sabre coming at me very quickly. He came on for a few more seconds, and suddenly I saw the smoke and tracers that he was firing his six machine guns. Death was coming for me, and all I could do was wait as he came after me. Fortunately, the Sabre was about 800-1000 meters away, and the tracers flew by tens of meters below me. But for those very few seconds the tracers began to head up towards my legs and only stopped a few meters away.
Perhaps at the last second I could pull my legs up at the moment that I felt the bullets were about to hit my legs. But at that precise moment the tracers stopped. I could see the Sabre bank away sharply when 500 meters away, and passing about 50 meters away from me, make a quick turn. I got nauseous from his jet exhaust as he passed. I saw the Sabre make another turn and come back to attack me again. 
Now I understood that he wanted to get even for the death of his leader, but then I didn’t want to think about that so silently waited for the end to come. The second time, I thought, he won’t miss.
I looked down. The cloud was now much closer – perhaps 50-100 meters away. I thought: ‘What will happen first – will I go into the cloud or will his tracers hit me? If the Sabre opens fire, he won’t miss.’ But when the Sabre closed to 800 meters and new tracers flew from it, I poked into the cloud. It immediately became quite dark, humid, but it was a beautiful sensation that I was safe, as he could not see me and I did not see the approaching Sabre and his tracers."&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov. V Nebe Dvukh Voyn", Chast II, pp.206-208, EKSMO, Moscow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kramarenko landed safely was found by a North Korean villager who took care of him until he was recovered by a search party and returned to Antung.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov. V Nebe Dvukh Voyn", Chast II, pp.210-212, EKSMO, Moscow, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Sabre attacked by Kramarenko was the F-86E BuNo 50-636 of Major George V. Wendling ([[16th Weapons Squadron|16th FIS]]), which received "major damage" on that day.&lt;ref&gt;Warren E. Thompson and David R. McLaren, "MiG Alley. Sabres vs MiGs over Korea", Appendix A, p.166, Specialty Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Almost certainly the pilot who shot down and shot at the Soviet ace was Major William F. Shaeffer, of the 16th FIS, 51st FIW.&lt;ref&gt;Warren E. Thompson and David R. McLaren, "MiG Alley. Sabres vs MiGs over Korea", Appendix C, p.176, Specialty Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the decision of General Staff of USSR's Armed Forces, the VVS 303rd and 324th IAD were replaced by PVO divisions, the 97th and 190th IAD. So, on 31 January 324th, IAD ceased combat operations in Korea and 176th GIAP (and Kramarenko with it) returned to the Soviet Union.

==Credits for aerial victories of Sergei Makarovich Kramarenko==

In the [[German-Soviet War]] Sergei Kramarenko scored two individual victories and 10 more group (shared) kills, plus a balloon. During the [[Korean War]] he flew 104 combat sorties, engaged UN aircraft in 42 occasions, and was officially credited with 13 victories. After cross-referencing his credited victories with German and US losses, it seems that in fact he shot down one German warplane during World War II, and he scored at least eight or nine victories in Korea, besides seriously damaging three more UN jets.

==Post War Career and Family==
After his return to the Soviet Union, he studied at the Air Force Academy, where he graduated in 1954. Around that same time, in Moscow, he met an art student - Yulya Alekseyevna. Soon they began dating and going together to the Bolshoy Theater and others. In 1956 he got his first command duty as deputy commander of a regiment placed in Machulishchi, Belarus. In 1957 he proposed marriage to Yulya, and she accepted. Already married, that same year Kramarenko received his second command assignment - the 167th IAP in Georgia. Soon other commissions followed all over the Soviet Union, and he was also blessed by the births of his son Aleksandr and his daughter Nadezhda.

In 1970 he received a new appointment, this time on foreign soil: the Iraqi Air Force had bought brand new MiG-21s, and Kramarenko helped Iraqi pilots and officers to learn to operate the Soviet aircraft and trained them in tactics. A similar duty followed in Algeria in the mid-1970s. Finally, already a Major-General of the Air Force, Kramarenko retired in 1977.

In 1981, Karamenko became the vice-president of the ''Rossiskaya Assotsiatsya Geroev (Russian Association of Heroes, the War Veteran Association, named that way because many of his members are Heroes of the Soviet Union)'', a post which he currently holds.  He published his autobiography, titled "''Против «мессеров» и «сейбров»''", or ''"Against the Messers and Sabres"'' in 2006. It was translated into English in 2008 as ''"The Red Air Force at War: Air Combat Over the Eastern Front &amp; Korea"'' . Sergei Kramarenko currently live in his flat in Moscow together with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Mkakrovich Kramarenko, "Protiv Messerov i Seybrov.

'''Shriekfest Horror Film Festival''' is a [[film festival]] specializing in the [[Horror film|horror]] genre. It is the longest running horror festival in [[Los Angeles]]. In 2017, Shriekfest expanded to include an Orlando, FL festival location.

==History==
Shriekfest Horror Film Festival was founded in July 2001.&lt;ref name="Shriekfest-r15" /&gt; It is the oldest continually running genre festival in Los Angeles, California. It is held in October at [[Raleigh Studios]] on Melrose Boulevard in the [[Charlie Chaplin Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17498 | title = Shriekfest 2009 Horror Film Festival Line-Up Announced | work = [[Bloody Disgusting]] | date = 2009-09-25 | accessdate = 2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival was founded by actress [[Denise Gossett]]&lt;ref name="Shriekfest-r5" /&gt; with her partner Kimberlee Beeson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/94239/15th-annual-shriekfest-announces-its-call-for-entries/ | title = 15th Annual Shriekfest Announces its Call for Entries | work = Dread Central | accessdate = 2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gossett came up with the idea after starring in the horror film ''[[Chain of Souls]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Thomas M.| last=Sipos | url = http://www.hollywoodinvestigator.com/2003/shriekfest.htm | title = Horror Films Haunt Shriekfest 2003 | work = Hollywood Investigator | date = 2003-10-11 | accessdate = 2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She realized there was a scarcity of  film festivals and competitions for the horror genre.&lt;ref name="Shriekfest-r14" /&gt; She and Beeson created Shriekfest in the hopes that young and upcoming filmmakers and screenwriters would find in it an outlet for their talent. Their partnership lasted until 2003, after which time Todd Beeson became the new partner in the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.horrorsociety.com/2007/08/27/shriekfest-and-darkromancecom-team-up-for-a-second-time/ | title = Shriekfest and DarkRomance.com Team Up for a Second Time | work = Horror Society | date = 2007-08-27 | accessdate = 2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shriekfest awards multiple prizes for horror films and [[screenplay]]s. It also awards films in the [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] categories. Prizes include trophies, as well as cash, product awards, and publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.shockya.com/news/2010/04/14/call-for-entries-shriekfest-film-festival/ | title = Call for Entries Shriekfest Film Festival | work = Shockya.com | accessdate = 2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival also has an under-18 category open to young filmmakers and screenwriters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.filmfestivalworld.com/festival/Shriekfest_HorrorSciFi_Film_Festival/ | title = Shriekfest Horror/SciFi Film Festival | work = Film Festival World | accessdate = 2010-04-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100327162819/http://www.filmfestivalworld.com/festival/Shriekfest_HorrorSciFi_Film_Festival/ | archivedate = 2010-03-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shriekfest went [[environmentalism|green]] in 2010 and now accepts screenplays and films via email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://hellnotes.com/shriekfest-2010-goes-green | title = Shriekfest 2010 Goes Green | work = Hellnotes | accessdate = 2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Teatro Carignano''' ('''Carignano Theatre''') is a theatre in [[Turin]] and one of the oldest and most important theatres in Italy. Designed by [[Benedetto Alfieri]], it is located opposite the [[Palazzo Carignano]]. Building commenced in 1752 and the theatre was inaugurated the following year with a performance of [[Baldassare Galuppi]]'s opera, ''Calamità de' cuori''. Much of the theatre was destroyed in a fire in 1786, but it was rebuilt in a few months using Alfieri's original plans. Since then it has undergone several renovations. Although today it is primarily used for performances of plays, in the past it was an important [[opera house]]. The theatre is owned by the City of Turin but administered by the theatre company, Teatro Stabile di Torino, and is one of the company's principal performing venues.

==Premieres and debuts==
Premieres and notable debuts at the Teatro Carignano include:&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise indicated this list is sourced from Casaglia (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Giovanni Pacini]]'s opera ''La schiava di Bagdad'' (world premiere, 28 October 1820)
*[[Nicola Vaccai]]'s opera ''La pastorella feudataria'' (world premiere, 18 September 1824)
*Dancer [[Domenico Ronzani]]'s debut as a choreographer in the ballet ''La Morte di Procotieff'' (Autumn 1840)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2366">The '''Festival International des Très Courts''' is an international [[film festival]] of [[short subject|Shorts]] created in 1999 and held each year in dozens of cities simultaneously.

The festival aims to promote the production of films in the ''Very Short'' format (3 minutes maximum, excluding title and credits). Productions come from all over the world. The International Selection broadcasts simultaneously in all participating cities.

==The Eleventh Edition==
The 11th Festival was held on 24th 25th and 26 April 2009, in 71 cities spread over 17 countries. The International Selection included 52 films from 19 countries.

==Organization of the Festival==
International coordination of the festival is managed from [[Paris]]. Programming by ''Tres d'Esprit'' and broadcasting by ''Nanospheres Productions''. In each city, local companies govern their festival. Each year approximately 50 short films are selected from over 1000 viewed, from all continents. Then the films are submitted to a jury to deliver three awards: the ''Grand Prix'', the prize for ''animation'' and the ''originality prize''. A fourth, the ''public prize'', is awarded on the internet by the public. Cities and countries may have their own selection in addition to the International Selection,  for example the Quebec festival for 2009 had a category of films made in Quebec.

==The jury presidents==

Each year, a president is chosen to chair the jury of the official selection of the festival.

[[File:NightShift.png|thumb|The logo for The Night Shift]]

'''The Night Shift''' is the name given to a series of concerts run by the '''[[Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment]]'''. As a Resident Orchestra at the [[Southbank Centre]], the first Night Shift took place on 22 May 2006 at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]]. Since then there have been fifteen further concerts at venues including the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]], [[Royal Festival Hall]], [[The Roundhouse]] and the Corn Exchange, [[Brighton Dome]].

The Night Shift aims to "present classical music in a new way to attract an audience that rarely or never attends classical music".  It is characterised by its lack of formalities traditionally associated with classical music and key features include the following:

* Pre and post concert entertainment such as [[DJ]]s, [[Folk music|Folk]] and [[Jazz]] groups, [[VJ (video performance artist)|VJs]] and dance
* Drinks promotions and drinks allowed in the concert hall,
* A relaxed atmosphere in the concert hall; the audience is encouraged to move, talk and clap as they wish.
* The concert is presented from the stage and includes interviews with performers and questions from the audience.

Ticket prices are kept low, typically £8 in advance, £12 on the door and £4 for students. To date there have been over 7500 attendances at Night Shift events, with a peak audience of 1,200 at [[The Roundhouse]] on 29 January 2010, where [[Vladimir Jurowski]] conducted [[Beethoven]]’s [[Coriolan Overture]] and [[beethoven symphony 7|Symphony No. 7]]. The one-hour concert was presented by [[Alistair Appleton]], accompanied by live video projections. Other artists to have appeared at The Night Shift include [[Robin Ticciati]], [[Marin Alsop]], [[Rachel Podger]], [[Edward Gardner (conductor)|Edward Gardner]], [[Christian Tetzlaff]], Eduardo Portal, [[Stephen Hough]] and [[Yannick Nézet-Séguin]].

On 13 August The Night Shift will be debuting at [[Wiltons Music Hall|Wilton’s Music Hall]] in [[London East End|London’s East End]], performing a programme of [[Handel]] and [[Purcell]], played on seventeenth-century instruments, with a support show from Nathan ‘Flutebox’ Lee, the [[beatboxing]] flute player.

In January 2010, independent research into The Night Shift&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Anne | last=Millman | year=2010 | title=Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment: The Night Shift}}&lt;/ref&gt; was produced which revealed a number of trends. All Night Shift surveys showed a high proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds, followed by 19- to 24-year-olds and 35- to 44-year-olds, with few attendees over the age of 45, and approximately 30-40% of ticket sales attributed to students.
Major motivating factors included ''competitive ticket pricing'', ''informal atmosphere'' and the ''influence of friends''. The research gave the following conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, The Night Shift is cool. The Night Shift succeeds in reversing all negative preconceptions of live classical music concerts: in the course of an hour or so attendees moved from expectations that the experience will be expensive, formal, long, middle aged, proper, strict and stuffy to an understanding that it can be accessible, comfortable, inclusive, informal, laid back, relaxing, spontaneous and studenty. The OAE is doing a service to the entire sector.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another piece of independent research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dobson | first=Melissa |title=Journal of New Music Research |publisher=Routledge |date = July 2010|chapter=New Audiences for Classical Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in August 2010 highlighted the effectiveness of the use of embedded information in The Night Shift concert format. It found that the use of audience participation, verbal introductions, explanations from the stage and demonstrations of different ways of playing the same passage of music all helped create a more inclusive atmosphere and build a rapport with audience members, particularly those relatively unfamiliar with classical music.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Ventricular fibrillation''' ('''V-fib''' or '''VF''') is when the [[heart]] quivers instead of pumping due to disorganized [[electrical conduction system of the heart|electrical activity]] in the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]].&lt;ref name=NIH2011/&gt; It is a type of [[cardiac arrhythmia]].&lt;ref name=NIH2011/&gt; Ventricular fibrillation results in [[cardiac arrest]] with [[loss of consciousness]] and no [[pulse]].&lt;ref name=Bal2016/&gt; This is followed by [[death]] in the absence of treatment.&lt;ref name=NIH2011/&gt; Ventricular fibrillation is found initially in about 10% of people in cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name=Bal2016/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Ventricular fibrillation is a cause of [[cardiac arrest]] and [[sudden cardiac death]]. The ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion (from the apex of the heart to the outflow of the ventricles), and so the [[ventricle (heart) |ventricle]]s fail to pump blood around the body – because of this, it is classified as a [[cardiac arrest]] rhythm, and patients in V-fib should be treated with [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and prompt [[defibrillation]]. Left untreated, ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body, including the heart, are starved of oxygen, and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli. Prior to cardiac arrest, patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying [[#Causes|cause]]. Patients may exhibit signs of [[agonal breathing]], which to a layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing, but is a sign of [[Shock (circulatory)|hypoperfusion]] of the [[brainstem]].

It has an appearance on [[electrocardiography]] of irregular electrical activity with no discernable pattern. It may be described as 'coarse' or 'fine' depending on its amplitude, or as progressing from coarse to fine V-fib. Coarse V-fib may be more responsive to defibrillation, while fine V-fib can mimic the appearance of [[asystole]] on a [[defibrillator]] or [[cardiac monitor]] set to a low [[Gain (electronics) |gain]].  Some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine V-fib in the hope that it can be reverted to a [[cardiac rhythm]] compatible with life, whereas others will deliver [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and sometimes [[drug]]s as described in the [[advanced cardiac life support]] protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation.

==Causes==
Ventricular fibrillation has been described as "chaotic asynchronous fractionated activity of the heart" (Moe et al. 1964). A more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a "turbulent, disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded [[electrocardiogram|electrocardiograph]]ic deflections continuously change in shape, magnitude and direction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Robles de Medina | first1 = EO | last2 = Bernard | first2 = R | last3 = Coumel | first3 = P | others = et al |title= Definition of terms related to cardiac rhythm.  WHO/ISFC Task Force |journal= Eur J Cardiol |volume=8 |issue=b2 |pages= 127–44 |year=1978 |pmid= 699945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ventricular fibrillation most commonly occurs within [[disease]]d hearts, and, in the vast majority of cases, is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease. Ventricular fibrillation is also seen in those with [[cardiomyopathy]], [[myocarditis]], and other heart pathologies. In addition, it is seen with [[electrolyte imbalance]], overdoses of [[Cardiotoxicity|cardiotoxic]] drugs, and following near [[drowning]] or [[major trauma]].&lt;ref name= "Mogayzel et al 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= https://doi.org/10.1016/S0196-0644(95)70263-6 |title= Out-of-Hospital Ventricular Fibrillation in Children and Adolescents: Causes and Outcomes |date= April 1995 |last=Mogayzel |first=Cyndra |last2=Quan |first2= Linda |website=Annals of Emergency Medicine |pages= 484–91 |doi= 10.1016/s0196-0644(95)70263-6 |access-date=2017-07-21 |last3=Graves |first3=Judith R |last4= Tiedeman |first4= Dean |last5= Fahrenbruch |first5= Carol |last6=Herndon |first6= Paul |volume= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also notable that ventricular fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause, the so-called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.

Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation occurs with a reputed incidence of approximately 1% of all cases of out-of-hospital arrest, as well as 3–9% of the cases of ventricular fibrillation unrelated to [[myocardial infarction]], and 14% of all ventricular fibrillation resuscitations in patients under the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Viskin | first1 = S | last2 = Belhassen | first2 = B |title=Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation |journal=Am. Heart J. |volume= 120 |issue=3 |pages=661–71 |year=1990 |pmid= 2202193 |doi= 10.1016/0002-8703(90)90025-S|url= http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0002-8703(90)90025-S}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows then that, on the basis of the fact that ventricular fibrillation itself is common, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation accounts for an appreciable mortality. Recently described syndromes such as the [[Brugada Syndrome]] may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias. In the Brugada syndrome, changes may be found in the resting [[ECG]] with evidence of [[right bundle branch block]] (RBBB) and ST elevation in the chest leads V1-V3, with an underlying propensity to sudden cardiac death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Brugada | first1 = P | last2 = Brugada | first2 = J |title=Right bundle branch block, persistent ST segment elevation and sudden cardiac death: a distinct clinical and electrocardiographic syndrome. A multicenter report |journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. |volume=20 |issue= 6 |pages=1391–6 |year=1992 |pmid=1309182 |doi= 10.1016/0735-1097(92)90253-J|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevance of this is that theories of the underlying pathophysiology and electrophysiology must account for the occurrence of fibrillation in the apparent "healthy" heart. It is evident that there are mechanisms at work that we do not fully appreciate and understand. Investigators are exploring new techniques of detecting and understanding the underlying mechanisms of sudden cardiac death in these patients without pathological evidence of underlying heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last1 =Saumarez | first1 = RC | last2 = Heald | first2 = S | last3 = Gill | first3 = J | others = et al |title= Primary ventricular fibrillation is associated with increased paced right ventricular electrogram fractionation |journal=Circulation |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=2565–71 |year=1995 |pmid=7586358 |doi= 10.1161/01.cir.92.9.2565|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7586358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Familial conditions that predispose individuals to developing ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death are often the result of gene mutations that affect cellular transmembrane ion channels. For example, in Brugada Syndrome, sodium channels are affected. In certain forms of long QT syndrome, the potassium inward rectifier channel is affected.

===Abnormal automaticity===
Automaticity is a measure of the propensity of a fiber to initiate an impulse spontaneously. The product of a [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] myocardium can be hyperirritable myocardial cells. These may then act as pacemakers. The ventricles are then being stimulated by more than one [[pacemaker]]. Scar and dying tissue is inexcitable, but around these areas usually lies a penumbra of hypoxic tissue that is excitable. Ventricular excitability may generate [[re-entry ventricular arrhythmia]].

Most myocardial cells with an associated increased propensity to arrhythmia development have an associated loss of [[membrane potential]]. That is, the maximum diastolic potential is less negative and therefore exists closer to the [[threshold potential]]. Cellular depolarisation can be due to a raised external concentration of [[potassium]] ions K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, a decreased intracellular concentration of [[sodium]] ions Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, increased permeability to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or a decreased permeability to K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The ionic basic automaticity is the net gain of an intracellular positive charge during diastole in the presence of a voltage-dependent channel activated by potentials negative to &amp;ndash;50 to &amp;ndash;60&amp;nbsp;mV.

Myocardial cells are exposed to different environments. Normal cells may be exposed to hyperkalaemia; abnormal cells may be perfused by normal environment. For example, with a healed myocardial infarction, abnormal cells can be exposed to an abnormal environment such as with a myocardial infarction with myocardial ischaemia. In conditions such as myocardial ischaemia, possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration, the increased external K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration, norepinephrine release and acidosis.&lt;ref&gt;Ho K 1993&lt;/ref&gt; When myocardial cell are exposed to hyperkalemia, the maximum diastolic potential is depolarized as a result of the alteration of Ik1 potassium current, whose intensity and direction is strictly dependent on intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations. With Ik1 suppressed, an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation of [[funny current]] even in myocardial cells (which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents). This can lead to the instauration of automaticity in ischemic tissue.

===Re-entry===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ventricular fibrillation]] --&gt;
The role of re-entry or circus motion was demonstrated separately by Mines and Garrey.&lt;ref&gt;Mines GR 1913, Garrey WE 1914&lt;/ref&gt; Mines created a ring of excitable tissue by cutting the atria out of the [[ray fish]]. Garrey cut out a similar ring from the [[turtle]] ventricle. They were both able to show that, if a ring of excitable tissue was stimulated at a single point, the subsequent waves of depolarisation would pass around the ring. The waves eventually meet and cancel each other out, but, if an area of transient block occurred with a [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] that blocked one wavefront and subsequently allowed the other to proceed retrogradely over the other path, then a self-sustaining circus movement phenomenon would result. For this to happen, however, it is necessary that there be some form of non-uniformity. In practice, this may be an area of [[ischemic]] or [[infarct]]ed myocardium, or underlying [[Myocardial scarring|scar tissue]].

It is possible to think of the advancing wave of depolarisation as a dipole with a head and a tail. The length of the refractory period and the time taken for the dipole to travel a certain distance—the propagation velocity—will determine whether such a circumstance will arise for re-entry to occur. Factors that promote re-entry would include a slow-propagation velocity, a short refractory period with a sufficient size of ring of conduction tissue. These would enable a dipole to reach an area that had been refractory and is now able to be depolarised with continuation of the [[wavefront]].

In clinical practice, therefore, factors that would lead to the right conditions to favour such re-entry mechanisms include increased heart size through [[hypertrophy]] or dilatation, drugs which alter the length of the refractory period and areas of cardiac disease. Therefore, the substrate of ventricular fibrillation is transient or permanent conduction block. Block due either to areas of damaged or refractory tissue leads to areas of myocardium for initiation and perpetuation of fibrillation through the phenomenon of re-entry.

===Triggered activity===
Triggered activity can occur due to the presence of [[Afterdepolarization|afterdepolarisations]]. These are depolarising oscillations in the membrane voltage induced by preceding action potentials. These can occur before or after full repolarisation of the fiber and as such are termed either early (EADs) or delayed afterdepolarisations (DADs). All afterdepolarisations may not reach threshold potential, but, if they do, they can trigger another afterdepolarisation, and thus self-perpetuate.

The distribution of frequency and power of a waveform can be expressed as a power spectrum in which the contribution of different waveform frequencies to the waveform under analysis is measured. This can be expressed as either the dominant or peak frequency, i.e., the frequency with the greatest power or the median frequency, which divides the spectrum in two halves.

Frequency analysis has many other uses in medicine and in cardiology, including analysis of heart rate variability and assessment of cardiac function, as well as in imaging and acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Shusterman V, Beigel A, Shah SI, etal |title=Changes in autonomic activity and ventricular repolarization |journal=J Electrocardiol |volume=Suppl |issue= |pages=185–92 |series=32 |year=1999 |pmid=10688324 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-0736(99)90078-X|url=}}&lt;!-- other PMIDs  10413369 9857869 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kaplan SR, Bashein G, Sheehan FH, etal |title=Three-dimensional echocardiographic assessment of annular shape changes in the normal and regurgitant mitral valve |journal=Am.

== Treatment ==

[[Defibrillation]] is the definitive treatment of ventricular fibrillation, whereby an electrical current is applied to the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles, with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for coordinated contractions to occur again. The use of this is often dictated around the world by [[Advanced Cardiac Life Support]] or [[Advanced Life Support]] algorithms, which is taught to medical practitioners including doctors, nurses and paramedics and also advocates the use of drugs, predominantly [[epinephrine]], after every second unsuccessful attempt at defibrillation, as well as [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) in between defibrillation attempts. Though ALS/ACLS algorithms encourage the use of drugs, they state first and foremost that defibrillation should not be delayed for any other intervention and that adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation be delivered with minimal interruption.

The [[precordial thump]] is a manoeuver promoted as a mechanical alternative to defibrillation. Some advanced life support algorithms advocate its use once and only in the case of witnessed and monitored V-fib arrests as the likelihood of it successfully [[cardioversion|cardioverting]] a patient are small and this diminishes quickly in the first minute of onset.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Patients who survive a 'V-fib arrest' and who make a good recovery from this are often considered for implantation of an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]], which can quickly deliver this same life-saving defibrillation should another episode of ventricular fibrillation occur outside a hospital environment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Epidemiology==
Sudden [[cardiac arrest]] is the leading cause of death in the industrialised world. It exacts a significant mortality with approximately 70,000 to 90,000 sudden cardiac deaths each year in the United Kingdom, and survival rates are only 2%.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] Guidelines 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these deaths are due to ventricular fibrillation secondary to [[myocardial infarction]], or "heart attack".&lt;ref&gt;Myerburg RJ et al. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; During ventricular fibrillation, [[cardiac output]] drops to zero, and, unless remedied promptly, death usually ensues within minutes.

==History==

Lyman Brewer suggests that the first recorded account of ventricular fibrillation dates as far back as 1500 BC, and can be found in the [[Ebers papyrus]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. The extract recorded 3500 years ago may even date from as far back as 3500 BC. It states: "When the heart is diseased, its work is imperfectly performed: the vessels proceeding from the heart become inactive, so that you cannot feel them … if the heart trembles, has little power and sinks, the disease is advanced and death is near." A book authored by Jo Miles suggests that it may even go back farther. Tests done on frozen remains found in the Himalayas seemed fairly conclusive that the first known case of ventricular fibrillation dates back to at least 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brewer LA |title=Sphygmology through the centuries. Historical notes |journal=Am. J. Surg. |volume=145 |issue=6 |pages=695–701 |year=1983 |pmid=6344674 |doi= 10.1016/0002-9610(83)90124-1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether this is a description of ventricular fibrillation is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brewer LA |title=Sphygmology through the centuries. Historical notes |journal=Am. J. Surg. |volume=145 |issue=6 |pages=696–702 |year=1983 |pmid=6344674 |doi= 10.1016/0002-9610(83)90124-1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next recorded description occurs 3000 years later and is recorded by [[Vesalius]], who described the appearance of "worm-like" movements of the heart in animals prior to death.

The significance and clinical importance of these observations and descriptions possibly of ventricular fibrillation were not recognised until John Erichsen in 1842 described ventricular fibrillation following the [[Ligature (medicine)|ligation]] of a [[coronary artery]] (Erichsen JE 1842). Subsequent to this in 1850, fibrillation was described by Ludwig and Hoffa when they demonstrated the provocation of ventricular fibrillation in an animal by applying a "[[Michael Faraday|Faradic]]" (electrical) current to the heart.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffa M et al. 1850&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, [[Alfred Vulpian|Edmé Félix Alfred Vulpian]] coined the term ''mouvement fibrillaire'', a term that he seems to have used to describe both atrial and ventricular fibrillation.&lt;ref&gt;Vulpian A 1874&lt;/ref&gt; John A. MacWilliam, a physiologist who had trained under Ludwig and who subsequently became Professor of Physiology at the [[University of Aberdeen]], gave an accurate description of the [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] in 1887. This definition still holds today, and is interesting in the fact that his studies and description predate the use of [[electrocardiography]]. His description is as follows: "The ventricular muscle is thrown into a state of irregular arrhythmic contraction, whilst there is a great fall in the arterial blood pressure, the ventricles become dilated with blood as the rapid quivering movement of their walls is insufficient to expel their contents; the muscular action partakes of the nature of a rapid incoordinate twitching of the muscular tissue … The cardiac pump is thrown out of gear, and the last of its vital energy is dissipated in the violent and the prolonged turmoil of fruitless activity in the ventricular walls." MacWilliam spent many years working on ventricular fibrillation and was one of the first to show that ventricular fibrillation could be terminated by a series of induction shocks through the heart.&lt;ref&gt;MacWilliam JA 1887&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[electrocardiogram]] recording of ventricular fibrillation was by August Hoffman in a paper published in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman A 1912&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, two other researchers, George Ralph Mines and Garrey, working separately, produced work demonstrating the phenomenon of [[Ventricular fibrillation#Re-entry|circus movement]] and [[Ventricular fibrillation#Re-entry|re-entry]] as possible substrates for the generation of arrhythmias. This work was also accompanied by Lewis, who performed further outstanding work into the concept of "circus movement."

Later milestones include the work by [[W. J. Kerr]] and [[W. L. Bender]] in 1922, who produced an electrocardiogram showing [[ventricular tachycardia]] evolving into ventricular fibrillation.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, WJ et al. 1922&lt;/ref&gt; The re-entry mechanism was also advocated by DeBoer, who showed that ventricular fibrillation could be induced in late systole with a single shock to a frog heart.&lt;ref&gt;De Boer S 1923&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "R on T ectopics" was further brought out by Katz in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Katz LN 1928&lt;/ref&gt; This was called the “vulnerable period” by Wiggers and Wegria in 1940, who brought to attention the concept of the danger of [[Premature ventricular contraction|premature ventricular beats]] occurring on a [[T wave]].

Another definition of VF was produced by Wiggers in 1940. He described ventricular fibrillation as "an incoordinate type of contraction which, despite a high [[metabolic rate]] of the [[myocardium]], produces no useful beats. As a result, the arterial pressure falls abruptly to very low levels, and death results within six to eight minutes from anemia [ischemia] of the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wiggers, CJ et al. 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

Spontaneous conversion of ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm is rare in all but small animals.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Defibrillation]] is the process that converts ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm. This is usually by application of an [[electric shock]] to the myocardium and is discussed in detail in the relevant article.
