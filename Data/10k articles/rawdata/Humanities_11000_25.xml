[[File:East-Hem 700ad.jpg|thumb|300px|Eastern Hemisphere at the end of the 7th century.]]

The '''7th century''' is the period from [[601]] to [[700]] in accordance with the [[Julian calendar]] in the [[Common Era]]. The [[Muslim conquests]] began with the unification of Arabia by [[Muhammad]] starting in [[622]]. After Muhammad's death in [[632]], [[Islam]] expanded beyond the [[Arabian Peninsula]] under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] (632–661) and the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] (661–750). The [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] in the 7th century led to the downfall of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. Also conquered during the 7th century were [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Arab conquest of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]].

The [[Byzantine Empire]] continued suffering setbacks during the rapid expansion of the [[Caliphate|Muslim Empire]].

In the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the 7th century was the ''Siglo de Concilios'', that is, century of councils, referring to the [[Councils of Toledo]].

[[Harsha]] united [[Northern India]], which had reverted to small republics and states after the fall of the [[Gupta Empire]] in the 6th century.

In [[China]], the [[Sui dynasty]] was replaced by the [[Tang dynasty]], which set up its military bases from Korea to [[Central Asia]], and was next to the Arabian later. China began to reach its height. [[Silla]] allied itself with the Tang Dynasty, subjugating [[Baekje]] and defeating [[Goguryeo]] to unite the [[Korean Peninsula]] under one ruler.  The [[Asuka period]] persisted in [[Japan]] throughout the 7th century.

'''''A Fictional Guide to Scotland''''' is a collection of [[short stories]] and one [[poem]] from 17 writers who were either [[Scottish people|Scottish]] by birth or lived in [[Scotland]] at the time of submission.  The pieces which made it into the book were selected through an anonymous submissions process with an [[OpenInk]] editor Elizabeth Reeder and guest editors, [[Meaghan Delahunt]] and [[Suhayl Saadi]], choosing the final pieces.

OpenInk was a group of Glasgow-based writers who came together out of a desire to create publications which offered writers and readers a unique experience. The OpenInk Editorial board was entirely voluntary. One of the editors was a full-time writer working both on her own writing and as a writer in residence in Glasgow. The remaining editors worked by day in a range of professions and wrote in their spare time.

The publication of the book was supported by a grant from [[Glasgow City Council]].  In addition, the editors raised a substantial amount of the money required for the project through sponsorship from friends and family.

In addition to the book, OpenInk ran a reading tour entitled ''A Fictional Guide to Scotland''. This reading tour visited places as far and wide as [[Wigtown]], [[Ullapool]], [[Inverness]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Stirling]], [[Lanark]] and [[Glasgow]] and was supported by the [[Scottish Arts Council]].

'''Adriano Valerini''' (active circa 1560-died 1590s) was an [[Italy|Italian]] actor of [[Commedia dell'arte]], active in Northern Italy.

He was born in [[Verona]], and could read Latin and Greek. He was the head of a company of actors. In Milan, he fell under the censorship of [[Charles Borromeo]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Italian Comedy'', by Pierre Louis Duchartre and Randolph T Weaver, 1928, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; He has published a tragic play ''l'Afrodite'', nearly one hundred [[madrigal]]s, a funeral oration for the fellow comic and possible mistress [[Vincenza Armani]],&lt;ref&gt;''Oratione D'Adriano Valerini Veronese, in morte della divina Signora Vincenza Armani, comica eccellentissima''.

An '''anti-establishment''' view or belief is one which stands in opposition to the conventional social, political, and economic principles of a society. The term was first used in the modern sense in 1958, by the [[UK|British]] magazine ''[[New Statesman]]'' to refer to its political and social agenda.&lt;ref&gt;The Compact Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition, Clarendon Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-19-861258-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Antiestablishmentarianism''' (or '''anti-establishmentarianism''') is an expression for such a [[political philosophy]].

The center-right electoral alliance led by League's secretary [[Matteo Salvini]] won a pluralities of seats in both houses. The M5S and the League agreed to form a [[Government of Change|government coalition]], which resulted in [[Giuseppe Conte]] being appointed Prime Minister and forming the [[Conte Cabinet|65th government of the Italian Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.afr.com/news/politics/world/italys-antiestablishment-party-leaders-agree-to-terms-for-government-20180531-h10tmx|title=Italy's anti-establishment party leaders agree to terms for government|date=2018-06-01|work=Financial Review|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/09/italys-populist-government-hopes-the-rules-change-in-its-favor.html|title=Italy's anti-establishment government hopes the rules change in its favor next May|last=Amaro|first=Silvia|date=2018-10-09|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Power to the People (Italy)|Power to the People]], a left-wing to far-left electoral alliance comprising several parties, organizations, associations, committees and [[Self-managed social centers in Italy|social centers]], is also an anti-establishment movement. In its manifesto, membership to Power to the People is described as "[[Social policy|social]] and [[Politics|political]], anti-[[Liberism|liberist]] and [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]], [[Communism|communist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]], [[Feminism|feminist]], [[Secularism|secular]], [[Pacifism|pacifist]], [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[Southern Italy autonomist movements|southernist]] [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]]", whose goal as coalition is "to create real democracy, through daily practices, [[self-governance]] experiments, [[socialisation]] of knowing and popular [[Participatory politics|participation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://poterealpopolo.org/manifesto|title=Manifesto Potere al Popolo|work=Potere al Popolo|access-date=2018-06-04|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 general election]], they obtained 370,320 votes for the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] (1.13%) and 319,094 votes for the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate]] (1.05%), without electing any representatives.

== Anti-establishment figures in the United Kingdom ==
In the UK anti-establishment figures and groups are seen as those who argue or act against the [[ruling class]]. Having an [[established church]], in England,  a [[Royal family|British monarchy]], an [[aristocracy]], and an unelected [[House of Lords|upper house]] in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] made up in part by [[Hereditary peer|hereditary nobles]], the UK has a clearly definable [[The Establishment|Establishment]] against which anti-establishment figures can be contrasted. In particular, [[satire|satirical humour]] is commonly used to undermine the deference shown by the majority of the population towards those who govern them. Examples of British anti-establishment satire include much of the humour of [[Peter Cook]] and [[Ben Elton]]; novels such as [[Rumpole of the Bailey]]; magazines such as [[Private Eye]]; and television programmes like [[Spitting Image]], [[Rumpole of the Bailey]], [[That Was The Week That Was]], and [[The Prisoner]] (see also the [[satire boom]] of the 1960s). Anti-establishment themes also can be seen in the novels of writers such as [[Will Self]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spikemagazine.com/0597self.php|title=Self Destruction|author=Chris Mitchell|work=Spike Magazine|accessdate=20 October 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061101072152/http://www.spikemagazine.com/0597self.php| archivedate= 1 November 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by operating through the arts and media, the line between politics and culture is blurred, so that [[pigeonholing]] figures such as [[Banksy]] as either anti-establishment or counter-culture figures can be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5346822.stm|title=Faces of the week|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 October 2006 | date=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] newspapers such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', are less subtle, and commonly report on the sex-lives of the [[House of Windsor|Royals]] simply because it sells newspapers, but in the process have been described as having anti-establishment views that have weakened traditional institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5385814.stm|title=Prince fears media embarrassment|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 October 2006 | date=27 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, as time passes, anti-establishment figures sometimes end up becoming part of the Establishment, as [[Mick Jagger]], the [[Rolling Stones]] frontman, became a [[Knight]] in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2045813.stm | work=BBC News | title=Jagger: It's only rock 'n' roll | date=12 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when [[The Who]] [[frontman]] [[Roger Daltrey]] was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 2005 in recognition of both his music and his work for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4249453.stm|title=Who singer Daltrey collects CBE|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 October 2006 | date=9 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernier responded to [[Power and Politics]] that he wanted to focus on the disaffected voters stating that "there is 20 per cent of the population who do not even bother to vote that his party will debate discussions that "the leadership and the caucus" did not want to have when he was a party member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bernier-departure-conservatives-didn-t-tell-1.4797877|title=Bernier didn't tell anyone from the Conservative Party about his dramatic exit {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== The pop term "anti-establishment" in the United States ==
Individuals who were anti-establishment often spoke of "fighting [[the man]]", "selling out to the Establishment", and "tearing down the Establishment." Many well renowned activists and activist groups innovated great changes to society by standing up to "[[the Establishment]]", including the [[MC5]], [[Symbionese Liberation Army]], [[Black Panther Party]], [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Malvina Reynolds]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Howard Zinn]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], [[System of a Down]], K-Rino, [[Immortal Technique]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Terminator X]], [[Gil-Scott Heron]], [[dead prez]], [[Timothy Leary]], [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], and [[Lupe Fiasco]] among others.

The "Establishment" to these, and these anti-establishment activists was not simply the people of the older generation. Dictionary.com defines the establishment as "the existing power structure in society; the dominant groups in society and their customs or institutions; institutional authority",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/establishment|title=The definition of establishment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Merriam-Webster defines the words as "a group of social, economic, and political leaders who form a ruling class"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/establishment|title=Definition of ESTABLISHMENT|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Free Dictionary defines it as "A group of people holding most of the power and influence in a government or society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/establishment|title=Establishment|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social critic and "people's" historian Howard Zinn defines the establishment as "Republicans, Democrats, newspapers [and] television" in his book, ''[[A People's History of the United States]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinnseven20.html|title=The Seventies: Under Control?|work=historyisaweapon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Zinn calls out the "huge military establishment" which one could assume is part of his definition of the "Establishment." In a chapter of the book that expresses Zinn's political theory for the future he defines "the Establishment [as] that uneasy club of business executives, generals, and politicos."&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, Howard. "The Coming Revolt of the Guards." History Is A Weapon. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 March 2012. &lt;http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinncomrev24.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in Zinn's book is a reprinted quote from Samuel Huntington, who was a Harvard University political science professor and White House political consultant, that describes the establishment and the coalition a president should establish upon being elected:
:"...the President act[s]...with the support and cooperation of key individuals and groups in the executive office, the federal bureaucracy, Congress, and the more important businesses, banks, law firms, foundations, and media, which constitute the private sector's "Establishment."...The day after [the President's]...election, the size of his majority is almost — if not entirely — irrelevant to his ability to govern the country. What counts then is his ability to mobilize support from the leaders of key institutions in a society and government. ... This coalition must include key people in Congress, the executive branch, and the private-sector 'Establishment'."&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, Howard. "The Seventies: Under Control?." History Is A Weapon. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 March 2012. &lt;http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinnseven20.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early usage ===
The anti-establishment began in the 1940s and continued through the 1950s. 

Many [[World War II]] [[veteran]]s, who had seen horrors and inhumanities, began to question every aspect of life, including its meaning. Urged to return to "normal lives" and plagued by [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (discussing it was "not manly"), many veterans found [[suburbia]] cloying and empty.

The [[Hells Angels]] were originally composed of WWII veterans feeling rebellious: the name came from WWII fighting units. The image of [[Marlon Brando]] as a motorcycle rebel in ''[[The Wild One]]'' and [[James Dean]] as a ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' horrified some Americans and electrified others. Some veterans, who founded the [[Beat Movement]], were denigrated as ''Beatniks'' and accused of being "downbeat" on everything. [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] wrote a Beat autobiography that cited his wartime service.

Many people craved angry "true" commentary such as Lenny Bruce's acid-tongued comedy, or simply a desire for more personal freedom, even "vices". [[Playboy magazine]], with its famous nudes, was the first [[skin mag]] sold alongside national magazines, and caused a scandal and backlash.

Many women also harbored a deep resentment. During the war years, they had been encouraged to assume men's roles in industry, both [[White-collar worker|white collar]] and [[blue collar]]. [[Rosie the Riveter]] was a national icon. But after the war, women were forced to give up their jobs and become homemakers.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Citizens had also begun to question authority, especially after the Gary Powers [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 Incident]], wherein President Eisenhower repeatedly assured people the USA was not spying on Russia, then was caught in a blatant lie. This general dissatisfaction was popularized by [[Peggy Lee]]'s laconic pop song "[[Is That All There Is?]]", but remained unspoken and unfocused. It was not until the [[Baby Boomers]] came along in huge numbers that protest became organized (or disorganized in the case of the hippies), who were named by the Beats as "little hipsters".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== 1960s ===
"Anti-establishment" became a buzzword of the tumultuous 1960s. Young people raised in comparative luxury saw many wrongs perpetuated by society and began to question "the Establishment". Contentious issues included the ongoing [[Vietnam War]] with no clear goal or end point, the constant military build-up and diversion of funds for the [[Cold War]], perpetual widespread poverty being ignored, money-wasting [[boondoggle (project)|boondoggle]]s like [[pork barrel]] projects and the [[Space Race]], festering race issues, a stultifying education system, repressive laws and harsh sentences for casual [[recreational drug use|drug use]], and a general malaise among the older generation. On the other side, "[[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]]" often regarded questions as accusations, and saw the younger generation as spoiled, drugged-out, sex-crazed, unambitious [[slacker]]s.

Anti-establishment debates were common because they touched on everyday aspects of life. Even innocent questions could escalate into angry diatribes. For example, "Why do we spend millions on a foreign war and a space program when our schools are falling apart?" would be answered with "We need to keep our military strong and ready to stop the Communists from taking over the world." As in any debate, there were valid and unsupported arguments on both sides. "[[Make love not war]]" invoked "America, love it or leave it."

[[File:Ken Westerfield 1977.jpg|thumb|320px|right|As a [[hippie]], [[Ken Westerfield]] helped to popularize [[Frisbee]] as an [[Flying disc games|alternative disc sport]] in the 1960s and 1970s.]]
As the 1960s simmered, the anti-Establishment adopted conventions in opposition to the Establishment. T-shirts and blue jeans became the uniform of the young because their parents wore collar shirts and slacks. Drug use, with its illegal panache, was favored over the legal consumption of alcohol. Promoting peace and love was the antidote to promulgating hatred and war. Living in genteel poverty was more "honest" than amassing a nest egg and a house in the [[suburb]]s. [[Rock and roll|Rock 'n roll]] was played loudly over [[easy listening]]. [[Draft dodger|Dodging the draft]] was passive resistance to traditional [[military service]]. Dancing was free-style, not learned in a ballroom. Over time, anti-establishment messages crept into popular culture: songs, fashion, movies, lifestyle choices, television.

The emphasis on freedom allowed previously hushed conversations about sex, politics, or religion to be openly discussed. A wave of radical liberation movements for minority groups came out of the 1960s, including [[second-wave feminism]]; [[Black Power]], [[Red Power]], and the [[Chicano Movement]]; and [[gay liberation]]. These movements differed from previous efforts to improve minority rights by their opposition to [[respectability politics]] and militant tone. Programs were put in place to deal with inequities: [[Equal Opportunity Employment]], the [[Head Start (education)|Head Start Program]], enforcement of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], [[desegregation busing|busing]], and others. But the widespread dissemination of new ideas also sparked a backlash and resurgence in conservative religions, new segregated private schools, [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] and [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion legislation]], and other reversals. Extremists tended to be heard more because they made good copy for newspapers and television. In many ways, the angry debates of the 1960s led to modern right-wing talk radio and coalitions for "traditional [[family values]]".

As the 1960s passed, society had changed to the point that the definition of the Establishment had blurred, and the term "anti-establishment" seemed to fall out of use.

=== 1960s to present: the use of anti-establishment rhetoric in American politics ===
Howard Zinn, in his bestseller titled ''A People's History of the United States'' mentions the concept of "establishment" several times in the book.

== Anti-establishment in India ==
In India, the 1960s saw emergence of a group of writers who called themselves [[Hungryalists]]. They were the first anti-establishment and counter culture writers in Bengal whose dissenting voice drew attention of the government and court cases were filed against them.&lt;ref&gt;Amritalok ISSN.0971-4308&lt;/ref&gt; The main anti-establishment voices in Bengali literature have been [[Malay Roy Choudhury]], [[Samir Roychoudhury]], [[Subimal Basak]] and Tridib Mitra.

== 1999 WTO protests, Occupy protests and anti-establishment thought ==
In 2011, with the rise of anti-austerity protests, the [[Arab Spring]], online activism like [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] and the advent of the [[Occupy protests]] targeting the power of high finance and fighting for "the 99%," anti-establishment thought has reappeared. BBC News commented in one article that "The sinister [[Guy Fawkes mask]] made famous by the film ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' has become an emblem for anti-establishment protest groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735 | work=BBC News | title=V for Vendetta masks: Who's behind them? | date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|1999 WTO protests]] the Earth Rainbow Network had (and still has) a page titled "The Anti-Establishment Files: Info and background material on the coming World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthrainbownetwork.com/AntiEstablishmentFiles.htm|title=The Anti-Establishment Files: The WTO meeting in Seattle|work=earthrainbownetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17489">'''Archontology''' is the study of historical offices and important positions in [[State (polity)|state]], [[international]], [[politics|political]], [[religion|religious]] and other organizations and societies. It includes [[chronology]], [[Order of succession|succession]] of office holders, their [[biography|biographies]] and related records.

==Background==
[[Political science]] and [[history]] would be void and misunderstood without naming its chief [[Actor (policy debate)|actors]]. In many cases, these actors were those who either sat on the [[throne]] or enjoyed popular support at [[election]] or violently seized the power when circumstances permitted. There have always been those who held important state, public and [[Political party|party]] offices, those who wielded [[Autocracy|absolute power]], those who were limited in their actions by [[law]] or [[tradition]]. This category colloquially known as "rulers" has been an object of studies in scientific [[chronology]] for long ages. An interest in studying the rulers emerged long before it became a part of history and chronology as academic disciplines. This distinctive interest in studying the chronologies of heads of states, governments, ministries and other offices may be rigorously defined as institutional chronology or even as archontology (from Greek, αρχων ([[archon]]), meaning ''ruler''; used specifically for supreme magistrates, as in [[Athens]], or even kings, as in the [[Cimmerian Bosporus]]).

==Development of archontology==
Institutional chronology as integral part of general chronology dates back to the times of first civilizations. One of the earliest efforts of ancient historians was aimed at compiling the chronology of contemporary rulers and their predecessors. The [[kinglist]]s, found in most centers of the ancient civilizations (for an example, see the [[Sumerian kinglist]]), formed a basis for building more detailed historical accounts and served as a skeleton for further historical studies. It is difficult to imagine what history of [[Ancient Egypt]] we would have, if modern [[historian]]s could not base their research on the tables of rulers by [[Manetho]] and the [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] inscriptions. The history of [[Rome]] would be difficult to reconstruct if we did not have the availability of [[consular]] lists. The tradition of keeping records of rulers survived through the ages and became a part of modern history and chronology, but in fact it appears as a distinctive field of study and independent discipline closely related to [[political science]] and legal studies.

Historians and chronographers built the lists of [[Monarch|kings]], [[Queen regnant|queen]]s, [[president]]s and other powerful leaders. Royal [[Genealogy|genealogies]] including information on [[reign]]s and [[Pedigree chart#In human genealogy|pedigree]] became the first analytical works in institutional chronology. A 17th-century work of [[R. P. Anselme]], ''Histoire de la maison royale de France et des grands officiers de la Couronne''&lt;ref&gt;[[R. P. Anselme]], ''Histoire de la maison royale de France et des grands officiers de la Couronne''. Paris, 1674&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of early studies focused on the heads of state and the holders of highest state offices.

The 19th and 20th centuries witnessed the appearance of general works attempting to compile the lists of rulers sorted out by nations and time.&lt;ref&gt;([[Anthony Marinus Hendrik Johan Stokvis|Stokvis]], [[Poole]], [[Spuler]], Truhart)&lt;/ref&gt; The most massive example of such study is the work of [[Peter Truhart]], ''Regenten der Welt/Regents of Nations''&lt;ref&gt;Peter Truhart, ''Regenten der Welt/Regents of Nations''. Munich, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; a universal reference book for heads of states and governments of all nations of all times. It was published twice, in 1985 and in 2001, but is still riddled with errors resulting from the attempt by its author to include as much information as available regardless of its validity from the viewpoint of chronology. Works focused on a narrow scope of research enjoyed a far better success. The ''Handbook of British Chronology'', a work continuously improved by its editors, serves as an excellent example of the combining of theoretical, historical and chronological methods.

A large number of studies closely related to the institutional chronology is represented by thematic works on rulers of different nations. These works may include documented information, but often deviate from the main course of archontology. Apparently in attempt to extend the limits of a target group, their authors often focus on curious but less important facts.

Contemporary archontology and genealogy receive the support of many enthusiasts interested in collecting the information related to the history of offices. Modern technical improvements should increase the sophistication of chronological analysis and turn institutional chronology into a more refined discipline. These fields not only offer opportunities for amateurs, but currently depend on their input, both as to facts and as to analysis and organization. However, the quality of studies has not yet dramatically improved. The process of collecting attracts many of those whose primary objectives were far from profound analysis and extensive study. The majority of the studies currently being published leans towards an easier approach.

==Approaches to archontology==
Further development of archontology as academic discipline requires new approaches. More attention to the facts determining the dates of reigns and offices. What should be accepted as a sound reason for dating the beginning of a reign: the death of a predecessor, the [[proclamation]] by parliament, [[coronation]]? What does officially determine the premature end of an office holder's tenure: the date of his/her [[resignation]], the date when the resignation was accepted by national [[legislature]], the installation of a successor? Such questions are often neglected or noted only occasionally. Therefore, the study of political developments and national legal systems should be recognized as essential tool in determination of dates. Personal identification of "rulers" should be used by adding biographical details including full names, [[titles]], precise dates and geographic locations of births and deaths.

Numerous studies contradict each other concerning even the most obvious dates. The reasons for such contradictions apparently lay in the fact that different authors were chiefly concerned with building consistent chronologies, which recorded each possible name and date, but failed to provide reasonable explanations for picking the dates and sometimes even for historical characters included in such records. In most of these works one can hardly find references to the primary sources including archival documents. A lack of details and proper explanations diminishes the quality of reference works on institutional chronology.

The availability of quality studies in this field varies from country to country. It is very simple to learn the dates and mechanisms of changing presidents in the [[United States]] from 1789, but not every book may answer the question what preceded the [[inauguration]] of [[George Washington]] and what role the presidents of the [[Continental Congress]] played in 1774 - 1788. The history of [[Russia]] is covered in thousands of studies, but we still cannot name a book providing documented dates for its heads of government in the 20th century as a constituent republic of the [[Soviet Union]]. A number of gaps remain for historians to fill. This enterprise would not involve only the study of printed primary sources, but also a lot of work in the [[archives]].

Archontology is not aimed at a simple collecting of dates and names, but combining them into detailed chronologies, where the changes of office holders are reasonably explained from the viewpoints of history, political science and law. This approach significantly boosts the value of the collected material and should help fill in the gaps existing in chronologies of national leaders. There is no carefully elaborated and universally accepted system for selecting and verifying chronological facts, but such a system would be extremely helpful to determine the criteria of selection for dates and names.

The lack of authoritative information results from many factors. It might seem to be easy, but verification of dates and creation of consecutive chronologies appears to be a challenging task. Lists of rulers used as appendices to academic works are usually over-simplified and poorly verified. This may be the case because the verification requires consulting a great number of official periodicals and collections of legal statutes published in various countries. The tiny facts related to the changes in government are hidden deeply in the minutes of national parliaments and executive bodies.

An illustrative example of discovering new names for institutional chronology is the story of [[Wilhelm Pfannkuch]], who was practically excluded from the list of rulers of [[Germany]] until the facts were found restoring his place in historical chronology. While [[Eduard David]], the first president of the ''Nationalversammlung'' (7 February 1919 - 13 February 1919), was always considered as temporary head of state of Germany from 7 February 1919 to 11 February 1919, the name of Pfannkuch was omitted. The minutes of the ''Nationalversammlung'' for 6 February 1919 reveal that Pfannkuch indeed chaired the Nationalversammlung on 6 February 1919 and partly on 7 February 1919 as ''Alterspräsident'' (president by age). Thus in his capacity as head of the national constituent assembly, he briefly exercised the functions of [[head of state]].

The study of national leadership chronologies may be enriched by attaching theoretical analysis of patterns found in political developments of different countries. Provisional governments, temporary substitutions of office holders, term definitions, authentic position titles, [[Regent|regencies]] – these topics form only a part of theoretical issues.

The works not focused on the institutional chronology tend to use colloquial terms and definitions, which partially distort the historical retrospective. Currently, most works on chronology of rulers and high state officials require extensive improvement as they appear as skeletons of names and dates, to which no flesh of facts is attached. A reader may find himself confused with thousands of unexplained dates and names, while different works continue to contradict each other, adding to the reader's confusion. The nations whose histories feature a rich variety of constitutional and unconstitutional changes of rulers are presented in the reference books in an impoverished form, due the fact that their institutional histories are not properly studied. It would not be a surprise to fail in finding the complete membership of a [[Nicaragua]]n governing [[Military dictatorship|junta]] in the mid-19th century, but we still lack definite works on many [[Europe]]an governments. A great number of stand-ins and short-lived political bodies await inclusion in the works on institutional chronology. All these omissions might be done away with only if we applied a more thorough approach to these studies.

Theoretical principles of institutional chronology are still far from being clearly formulated. A researcher puzzled with two or more conflicting dates needs a definite guidance on what event makes the date valid from the viewpoint of institutional chronology or needs an alternative date backed by facts. A simple question as to when an office holder legally took possession of his or her office may raise a number of tough questions. A very interesting instance of this issue is the case of the [[Executive Directory]] of the [[France|French Republic]] in 1795 - 1799. Various works on the history of the Executive Directory give rather contradicting answers to a question as to when a directory’s member formally took his office. A detailed study showed that at least three different approaches might be applied to the precise determination of their terms of office. Out of 13 directors, the initial four members officially entered into exercising their duties upon constituting the Directory as an executive body, seven – upon their election, and two – on the dates fixed in a special law. Despite the fact that numerous works on the history of France in the 18th century have been published and continue being published, these difficulties remain largely unknown. As a result, one finds conflicting and confusing appearances of the respective dates in reference works.

A significant portion of sources for studying the institutional chronology consists of the archives of actual legislation. The collections of documents issued for the purpose of governing by the heads of states and governments, ministers, military leaders and others contain valuable information for studying authentic definitions used by the office holders, their self-styles and official [[parlance]] in general. Slightest changes in styles, frequently ignored in the works on general history, might be restored only by careful examination of heritage accumulated by the national governments. For instance, it is known that the colloquial use of the term tsar for the All-Russian Emperor in 1721–1917 is strictly incorrect, because in this period the term [[tsar]] was used in the sense of monarch only for subsidiary (and partially imaginary) [[polities]] (with the exception of [[Poland]], at least from 1815 to 1830). The lack of proper definition for a ruler's style results in a distorted view of political development. The answers are often to be found exclusively in the study of legal documents.

==Disciplinary aims and objectives==
Besides purely academic interest, institutional chronology has a true practical meaning. It is used in many disciplines and can be utilized for different purposes. Definite and proven information on the terms of offices may be successfully used for dating the documents. The advantages of proven chronologies of office holders appear when reasonable defined terms of offices narrow the area of research. The right of signature pertinent to office holders and the dates of holding the office help determine the dates of issuing a document if such date was not found in original copy. The principle of using the rulers' names for year counting is known for many nations including [[ancient Rome]] and [[Greece]], imperial [[China]] and [[Japan]]. The regnal years have an essential role for chronology of [[England]] and other European countries. Thus, only a neatly composed chronology of rulers may serve as a good basis for researchers.

The ultimate goals of institutional chronology cannot be achieved only by removing discrepancies and filling the gaps in the lists of rulers. As a matter of fact, these gaps cannot be reconciled unless some universal definitions and terms are accepted by researchers. The criteria for selection of persons to be included in archontological studies, the criteria for selection and verification of terms and dates, the ways of identification of rulers and office holders are still to be defined. Current approaches should go through reconsideration for further improvement and sophistication.

To become an independent academic discipline, archontology should focus on elaborating new standards and terminology for classification of rulers and officials. The existing chronologies, based on well established facts, may serve as a basis for archontological studies, but it should be extended, restructured and supplemented with theoretical information including historical, political and juridical aspects for changes in the forms of government and governmental succession. It is not necessarily that the studies should focus on the succession of office holders. The research on authentic titles, mechanisms for succession, classification of legal information, inauguration ceremonies and others may form an organic part of archontology.

While a universal improvement of records for all nations and ages could hardly be expected in the nearest future, the study of institutional chronologies for particular countries and [[supranational]] unions should be encouraged through sophistication of methods and approaches. The appearance of enriched, verified and documented chronologies recorded with the appropriate [[technical terminology]] would signify a real improvement in the development of this field of study and would help the general regeneration of archontology.

==Writings and views==
Kelly is [[openly lesbian]]. Regarding her academic career, Kelly says, "If someone had told me 30 years ago that in 2010 I would be tenured and promoted to a professor as a publicly professed Lesbian at the country's largest Catholic university, I would not have believed them. I love the university and I think I have given back a great deal of my time and effort as a result."&lt;ref name="Outing DePaul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depauliaonline.com/focus/outing-depaul-1.2154591|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121183741/http://www.depauliaonline.com/focus/outing-depaul-1.2154591|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-21|title=Outing DePaul|publisher=The DePaulia|date=|accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among her research interests, Kelly lists feminist theory, [[LGBT|LGBT politics]], and [[queer theory]].

In 2005, Kelly published the collective memoir ''Telling Our Lives: Conversations on Solidarity and Difference'' with Frida Kerner Furman and Linda Williamson Nelson.

==Political career and LGBT activism==
In March 2010, Chicago Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]] named Kelly head of the city's LGBT advisory council for a three-year term. The council serves as a liaison for the gay community to the city government and is responsible for identifying areas of prejudice or discrimination impacting the gay community in relation to housing and human rights issues.&lt;ref name="Daley appoints new chair" /&gt;

==Controversy==
In 1979, Beth Kelly published an article and autobiographical account titled "On 'Woman/Girl Love'—Or, Lesbians Do 'Do It.'"  Kelly recounted a sexual relationship she experienced, beginning when she was 8 years old, with a grandaunt who was at least 40–50 years older, and described her personal involvement in similar relationships both "as a girl and as a woman." The article which presents a positive description of pederasty, has been reprinted by pro-[[pederasty]] organizations such as [[NAMBLA]].&lt;ref&gt;David Thorstad, [https://books.google.com/books?id=C37q4LOUNcgC&amp;pg=PA255 "Man/Boy Love and the American Gay Movement,"] in ''Male Intergenerational Intimacy: Historical, Socio-Psychological, and Legal Perspectives'', p. 255, 1991, {{ISBN|1560240008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2099">A '''bow-wow theory''' is any of the theories by various scholars, including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], on the [[Origin of language|origins]] of [[human language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Moran |first1=John |last2=Gode |first2=Alexander |title=On the origin of language |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1986 |isbn=0-226-73012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bow-wow theories suggest that the first human languages developed as [[onomatopoeia]], imitations of natural sounds.&lt;ref name=Thorndike&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.98.2531.1 |last=Thorndike |first=E.L. |title=The origin of language |journal=Science |series=New series |volume=98 |issue=2531 |pages=1–6 |date=2 July 1943 |url=http://www.psych.yorku.ca/gigi/documents/Thorndike_1943.pdf |pmid=17747316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "bow-wow theory" was coined by [[Max Müller]], a [[Philology|philologist]] who was critical of the notion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2709105 |last=Sprinker |first=Michael |title=Gerard Manley Hopkins on the origin of language |jstor=2709105 |journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]|volume=41 |issue=1 |date=January–March 1980 |pages=113–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bow-wow theory is largely discredited as an account of the origin of language,&lt;ref name=Thorndike/&gt; though some contemporary theories suggest that general imitative abilities may have played an important role in the evolution of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Malle |first1=Bertram F. |editor=T.

'''Buddharūpa''' (literally, "Form of the Awakened One") is the [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] term used in [[Buddhism]] for statues or models of beings who have obtained [[buddhahood]], including the historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].

==Commonalities==
Despite cultural and regional differences in the interpretations of texts about the life of [[Gautama Buddha]], there are some general guidelines to the attributes of a Buddharupa:
*Fingers and toes are elongated proportionately
*Long, aquiline nose
*Elongated earlobes
*Head protuberance
*Broad shoulders

The elongated earlobes are vestiges of his life as a prince, when he wore extravagant jewelry. The bump at the top of the head is the [[ushnisha]] and represents spirituality, wisdom, and awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Victoria and Albert Museum|title=Iconography of the Buddha|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/iconography-of-the-buddha/|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
{{further|Buddhist art}}
Depictions of the Buddha vary widely across cultures.

===Proportions===
The image of Buddhas started to emerge from the first century CE in [[North India]], developed in [[Gandhara]] and [[Mathura]]. The art of Gandhara was influenced by [[Ancient Greek art]], leading to the development of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] with anatomically well-proportioned and realistic figure of the Buddha. One of the most influential Buddhist art was [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art and the later [[Amaravati mandal, Andhra Pradesh|Amaravati]] style. From India the depiction of Buddha spread to the rest of Asia. The Buddharupas of India, Sri Lanka, Javanese [[Borobudur|Sailendra]] and [[Cambodian art]] usually depict a well-proportioned figure, but sometimes he is shown emaciated, in recollection of the Buddha's years of ascetic practices. Japanese buddharupas are often very square and stolid while Indian and Southeast Asian ones often have thinner figures.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Many people may be familiar with the "Happy" or "Laughing" Buddha, a different historical figure, who should not be confused with the images of Gautama Buddha. [[Budai]], a Chinese Buddhist monk also known as ''Hotei'', is depicted as fat and happy, almost always shown smiling or laughing, and is associated with [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha.

===Postures, gestures and artefacts===
Images of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] sometimes show him reclining, recalling the Buddha Shakyamuni's departure into final nirvana.

Other times he is holding various symbolic objects, or making symbolic [[mudra]]s (gestures).

The clothing also varies; in China and Japan, where it is considered socially improper for monks and nuns to expose the upper arm, the Buddharupa has a tunic and long sleeves, much like the traditional monks and nuns, while in India they are often topless. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Carsten Niebuhr''' or '''Karsten Niebuhr''' (17 March 1733 [[Cuxhaven|Lüdingworth]] – 26 April 1815 [[Meldorf]], [[Dithmarschen]]), a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]], [[cartographer]], and [[explorer]] in the service of [[Denmark]], is renowned for his participation in the Royal [[Danish Arabia Expedition (1761–67)|Danish Arabia Expedition]] (1761-1767). He was the father of the Danish-German statesman and historian [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], who published an account of his father's life in 1817.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Niebuhr.jpg|thumb|left|Carsten Niebuhr in the attire of a distinguished Arab in Yemen, gift from al-Mahdi 'Abbas, Imam of Yemen]]
Niebuhr was born in Lüdingworth (now a part of [[Cuxhaven]], [[Lower Saxony]]) in what was then [[Bremen-Verden]]. His father Barthold Niebuhr (1704-1749) was a successful  [[farmer]] and owned his own property. Carsten and his sister were educated at home by a local school teacher, then he attended the Latin School in [[Otterndorf]], near [[Cuxhaven]].

Originally Niebuhr had intended to become a [[surveying|surveyor]], but in 1757 he went to the ''Georgia Augusta'' [[University of Göttingen]], at this time Germany's most progressive institution of higher education. Niebuhr was probably a strong student because in 1760 [[Johann David Michaelis]] (1717-1791) recommended him as a participant in the Royal [[Danish Arabia Expedition (1761–67)|Danish Arabia Expedition]] (1761-1767), mounted by [[Frederick V of Denmark]] (1722-1766). For a year and a half before the expedition Niebuhr studied mathematics, cartography and navigational astronomy under [[Tobias Mayer]] (1723-1762), one of the premier astronomers of the 18th century, and the author of the Lunar Distance Method for determining longitude. Niebuhr's observations during the Arabia Expedition proved the accuracy and the practicality of this method for use by mariners at sea.

==Expeditions==
The expedition sailed in January 1761 via Marseilles and Malta to [[Istanbul]] and [[Alexandria]]. Then the members of the expedition visited [[Cairo]] and [[Sinai]], before traversing the [[Red Sea]] via [[Jiddah]] to [[Yemen]], which was their main destination. In [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]], on 25 May 1763, the expedition's philologist, [[Frederik Christian von Haven]], died, and on 11 July 1763, on the way to [[Sana]], the capital of Yemen, its naturalist [[Peter Forsskål]] also died. In Sana the remaining members of the expedition had an audience with the Imam of Yemen [[al-Mahdi Abbas]] (1719-1775), but suffered from the climate and returned to Mocha. Niebuhr seems to have preserved his own life and restored his health by adopting native dress and eating native food. From Mocha the expedition continued to [[Bombay]], the expedition's artist Georg Wilhelm Baurenfeind died on the 29th of August and the expedition's servant Lars Berggren on the following day; both were buried at sea. The surgeon Christian C. Kramer (1732-1763) also died, soon after landing in Bombay.

Niebuhr was now the only surviving member. He stayed in Bombay for fourteen months and then returned home by way of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Bushire]], [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] and [[Persepolis]]. His copies of the cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis proved to be a key turning-point in the decipherment of cuneiform, and the birth of [[Assyriology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niebuhr|first1=Carsten|title=Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien und andern umliegender Ländern|trans-title=Account of travels to Arabia and other surrounding lands|date=1778|publisher=Nicolaus Möller|location=Copenhagen, Denmark|volume= vol. 2|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TG5BAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=German}} ; see also [https://books.google.com/books?id=TG5BAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA150-IA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false the fold-out plate (Tabelle XXXI)] after p. 152.  From p. 150:  ''"Ich will auf der Tabelle XXXI, noch eine, oder vielmehr vier Inschriften H, I, K, L beyfügen, die ich etwa in der Mitte an der Hauptmauer nach Süden, alle neben einander, angetroffen habe.  Der Stein worauf sie stehen, ist 26 Fuß lang, und 6 Fuß hoch, und dieser ist ganz damit bedeckt.  Man kann also daraus die Größe der Buchstaben beurtheilen.  Auch hier sind drey verschiedene Alphabete."''  (I want to include in Plate XXXI another, or rather four inscriptions H, I, K, L, which I found approximately in the middle of the main wall to the south [in the ruined palace at Persepolis], all side by side.  The stone on which they appear, is 26 feet long and 6 feet high, and it's completely covered with them.  One can thus judge therefrom the size of the letters.  Also here, [there] are three different alphabets.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sayce|first1=Rev. Arnold H.|title=The Archaeology of the Cuneiform Inscriptions|date=1908|publisher=Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|location=London, England|page=9|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/stream/archaeologyofcun00sayc#page/8/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also visited the ruins of [[Babylon]] (making many important sketches), [[Baghdad]], [[Mosul]] and [[Aleppo]]. He seems also to have visited the [[Behistun Inscription]] in around 1764. After a visit to [[Cyprus]] he made a tour through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], crossed the [[Taurus Mountains]] to [[Bursa]], reached [[Constantinople]] in February 1767 and finally arrived in [[Copenhagen]] in the following November.

[[File:Map of Yemen, prepared by Niebuhr.tif|thumb|Map of Yemen, prepared by Niebuhr]] Niebuhr's production during the expedition is indeed impressive. It includes small-scale maps and charts of [[Yemen]], the [[Red Sea]], the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Oman]], and other larger scale maps covering the [[Nile Delta]], the [[Gulf of Suez]] and the regions surrounding various port cities he visited, including [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] and [[Surat]]. He completed 28 town plans of significant historical value because of their uniqueness for that period. In summary, Niebuhr's maps, charts and plans constitute the greatest single addition to the cartography of the region that was produced through field research and published in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence J. Baack|Baack, Lawrence J.]] ''Undying curiosity. Carsten Niebuhr and the Royal Danish Expedition to Arabia (1761-1767)''. Stuttgart, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and later career==
In 1773 Niebuhr married Christiane Sophia Blumenberg, the daughter of the crown physician, and for some years he held a post in the Danish military service, which enabled him to remain in [[Copenhagen]]. In 1776 he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In 1778 he accepted a position in the civil service of Danish [[Holstein]], and went to reside at [[Meldorf]] ([[Ditmarschen]]). In 1806 he was promoted to ''Etatsrat'', and in 1809 was made a Knight of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]], one of [[Denmark]]-[[Norway]]'s most valued honours for service.

==Works==
Niebuhr's first book, ''Beschreibung von Arabien'', was published in Copenhagen in 1772, the Danish government providing subsidies for the engraving and printing of its numerous illustrations. This was followed in 1774 and 1778 by the first two volumes of Niebuhr's ''Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien und andern umliegender Ländern''. These works (particularly the one published in 1778), and most specifically the accurate copies of the cuneiform inscriptions found at Persepolis, were to prove to be extremely important to the decipherment of cuneiform writing. Before Niebuhr's publication, cuneiform inscriptions were often thought to be merely decorations and embellishments, and no accurate decipherments or translations had been made up to that point. Niebuhr demonstrated that the three trilingual inscriptions found at Persepolis were in fact three distinct forms of cuneiform writing (which he termed Class I, Class II, and Class III) to be read from left to right. His accurate copies of the trilingual inscriptions gave Orientalists the key to finally crack the cuneiform code, leading to the discovery of Old Persian, Akkadian, and Sumerian.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer,Samuel Noah. The Sumerians: Their History, Culture and Character. University of Chicago Press, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

The third volume of the Reisebeschreibung, also based on materials from the expedition, was not published till 1837, long after Niebuhr's death, under the editorship of his daughter and his assistant, Johan Nicolaus Gloyer. Niebuhr also contributed papers on the interior of [[Africa]], the political and military condition of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and other subjects to a German periodical, the ''[[Deutsches Museum]]''. In addition, he edited and published the work of his friend Peter Forsskål, the naturalist on the Arabian expedition, under the titles ''Descriptiones animalium, Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica'' and ''Icones rerum naturalium'' (Copenhagen, 1775 and 1776).

[[French language|French]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translations of Niebuhr's narratives were published during his lifetime, and a condensed English translation of his own three volumes, prepared by [[Robert Heron (writer)|Robert Heron]], was published in Edinburgh in 1792, under the title "Travels through Arabia". A facsimile edition of this translation, as by "M. Niebuhr", was published in two volumes by the Libraire du Liban, Beirut (undated).

The government funds covered only a fraction of the printing costs for Niebuhr's first book, and probably a similar or smaller proportion of the costs for the other two volumes. To ensure that the volumes were published, Niebuhr had to pay over 80% of the costs himself. In all, Niebuhr devoted ten years of his life, the years 1768-1778, to the publication of six volumes of findings from the expedition. He had virtually no help from the academics who had conceived and shaped the expedition in [[Göttingen]] and [[Copenhagen]]. It was only Niebuhr's determination to publish the findings of the expedition that ensured that the [[Danish Arabia Expedition (1761–67)|Danish Arabia Expedition]] would produce results that would benefit the world of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence J. Baack|Baack, Lawrence J.]] ''Undying curiosity. Carsten Niebuhr and the Royal Danish Expedition to Arabia (1761-1767)''. Stuttgart, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Niebuhr died in [[Meldorf]] in 1815.

[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749-1832) highly prized Niebuhr's works. In 1811 he wrote to his son [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], that "You carry a name which I have learned to honour since my youth."

Carsten Niebuhrs Gade, a street in the port area of [[Copenhagen]], is named for him.

'''Catholic Church and politics''' aims to cover subjects of where the [[Catholic Church]] and [[politics]] share common ground.

==Background==
According to the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], "the separation of church and state does not require division between belief and public action, between moral principles and political choices, but protects the right of believers and religious groups to practice their faith and act on their values in public life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/faithful-citizenship/church-teaching/catholics-in-political-life.cfm "Catholics in Political Life", United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
As a program and a movement, political Catholicism - a political and cultural conception which promotes the ideas and social teaching of the [[Catholic Church]] (''[[Catholic social teaching]]'') in public life through government action - was started by [[Prussia]]n Catholics in the second half of the 19th century, as a response to [[secular]] social concepts. The main reason were the measures by Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] to limit the influence of Catholic Church, first in Prussia, and then in united Germany. That struggle is known in history as the ''[[Kulturkampf]]''.

From Germany, political Catholic social movements spread in [[Austria-Hungary]], especially in today's Austria, [[Christian Social Movement in Ukraine|Ukraine]], Slovenia and [[Croatian Catholic movement|Croatia]]. [[Catholic Action]] was the name of many groups of [[Laity|lay]] Catholics who were attempting to encourage a Catholic influence on political society.

After the 1891 [[encyclical]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' ''(Of New Things)'' by [[Pope Leo XIII]], political Catholic movements got a new impulse for development, and they spread the area of their involvement. With this encyclical, the Catholic Church expanded its interest in social, economical, political and cultural issues, and it called for a drastic conversion of Western society in the 19th century in the face of [[capitalist]] influences. Following the release of the document, the [[labour movement]] which had previously floundered began to flourish in Europe and later in North America. Catholic believers, both lay and clergy alike, had a desire for active social and political engagement in order to deal with acute social problems according to Catholic Christian principles, as opposed to a purely secular approach.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} For example, [[Mary Harris Jones]], better known as "Mother Jones", and the [[National Catholic Welfare Council]] were central in the campaign to end [[child labour]] in the [[United States]] during the early 20th century.

==Catholic movements in the 20th century==
{{more citations needed|date=July 2013}}

In the 20th century, Catholic political movements became very strong in Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Ireland, France and Latin America. What these movements had in common was a defense of the acquired rights of the Catholic Church (attacked by [[anticlerical]] politicians) and a defense of Christian faith and moral values (threatened by increasing [[secularization]]).  Members of opposing schools of thought called such attempts [[clericalism]].

These Catholic movements developed various forms of [[Christian democratic]] ideology, generally promoting a morally and socially conservative agenda whilst supporting a middle ground third way between unrestrained capitalism and state socialism.  [[Freemasons]] were seen mainly as enemies and vehement opponents of political Catholicism. A special situation occurred in Mexico, where an atheistic president ruled in the 1920s and oppressed the Church and Catholics.  This led to the open Christian revolution of 1926 to 1929, known as the [[Cristero War]].

Some of the earliest important political parties were:

*[[Conservative Catholic Party of Switzerland]] – 1848;
*[[Catholic Party (Belgium)]] – 1869;
*[[Centre Party (Germany)]] – with origins in 1870;
*[[Christian Social Party (Austria)]] – 1893;
*[[Popular Liberal Action]] in France – 1901;
*[[General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses]] ([[Netherlands]]) – 1904, transformed into the [[Roman Catholic State Party]] in 1926;
*[[Slovak People's Party]] – 1918;
*[[Croatian Popular Party (1919)|Croatian Popular Party]] – 1919;
*[[Italian People's Party (1919–1926)|Italian People's Party]] – 1919;
*[[Polish Christian Democratic Party]] – 1919;
*[[Bavarian People's Party]] – 1919;
*[[National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty]] in Mexico – 1924.
*[[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)]] - 1955

Most of these parties in Europe joined together in [[White International]] (1922). [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s mixture of Catholicism and nationalism received its own brand of [[National Catholicism]] and it inspired similar movements throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Payne1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley G. Payne|title=Spanish Catholicism: An Historical Overview|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGoqcg22N4gC&amp;pg=PR13|year=1984|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-09804-9|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to political parties, Catholic/Christian [[trade unions]] were created, which fought for [[worker's rights]]: the earliest include:

*[[Typographic Workers Trade Union]] in Spain (1897);
*[[Solidarity (South African trade union)|Solidarity]] in South Africa (1902);
*[[Confederation of Christian Trade Unions]] in Belgium (1904);
*[[Catholic Workers Union]] in  Mexico (1908);
*[[International Federation of Christian Trade Unions]] (IFCTO), in The Hague in 1920 (which was preceded by the [[International Secretariat of Christian Trade Unions]] founded in Zürich in 1908, led through the [[World Confederation of Labour]] (WCL) to today's [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC));
*[[French Confederation of Christian Workers]] (1919);
*[[Luxembourg Confederation of Christian Trade Unions]] (1921);
*[[Canadian Catholic Federation of Labour]] (1921)
*[[Young Christian Workers]] in Belgium (1924);
*[[Catholic Worker Movement]] in the USA (from 1933).

After World War II, more unions were formed, including:

*[[Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions]] (from 1950);
*[[Christian Trade Union Federation of Germany]] (from 1959);
*[[Christian Workers' Union]] in Belize (from 1963);
*[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] in Poland (from 1980).

Until the [[Second Vatican Council]], the Church did not always accept the model of modern democracy and its expansion into social and economic realms because it was wary of anticlerical socialistic tendencies. When Catholic social activists were perceived to be too extreme in social conflicts, the Church hierarchy tried to stop their excesses; occasions of this included the [[Worker-priest]] movement in France in the 1940s and 1950s, and [[liberation theology]] in Latin America in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. But some movements were strongly supported by the Church - in Australia the [[Catholic Social Studies Movement]] during the 1940s and 1950s, from which the [[National Civic Council]] has developed.

Catholic clergy and lay activists sometimes tended to support far-right leaders such [[Francisco Franco]] and [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], as well as the military regimes in [[Latin America]]. As a result, many workers involved in the [[labor movement]] joined [[social democratic]] and [[communist]] parties, which were sometimes secular and called for revolution against old values, which included religion and the Church.

In recent times, after the Second World War, Christian engagement in politics became weaker and even "Demo-Christian" parties by name lost some of their Christianity. Stronger Christian involvement in Europe on the beginning of the 21st century has produced some new small parties, for example those joined in the [[European Christian Political Movement]]. According to ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist [[Ross Douthat]], part of the younger generation of Catholics are now showing a renewed interest in forms of political Catholicism such as a revived [[Integralism#Catholic Integralism|Catholic Integralism]] or [[Tradinista!]] socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Douthat, Ross (October 8, 2016).

The '''Cave monastery of İnceğiz''' ({{lang-tr|İnceğiz Mağara Manastırı}}) is a [[cave monastery]] formed by carving a rocky cliff located in İnceğiz village of [[Çatalca]] district in [[Istanbul Province]], northwestern Turkey.

İnceğiz village is located about {{cvt|9|km}} northwest of Çatalca.&lt;ref name="sl"/&gt; The cave monastery is situated at Karasu Valley overlooking Karasu Creek. It is a four-story apartment building of [[rock-cut architecture]]. The structure was cut out in limestone formation, which has a suitable [[lithography]] for easy forming.&lt;ref name="cci"/&gt; The site in the cliff is accessible by a wooden staircase on the trail. The openings of the cliff dwelling are barred by chains.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

Initially, the four stories were interconnected. However, due to erosion and earthquakes, some parts of the structure collapsed, and so some of the connections are broken.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; The first floor contains three rooms.&lt;ref name="cci"/&gt; The staircase inside the structure leading from the first floor to the upper floors has broken down while only few steps below the second floor are intact. The second floor is accessible from outside.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;  On the second floor, there is a church measuring {{cvt|4.50|x|7|m}} with a large crucifix relief on the wall.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; The dome of the cross-formed room is {{cvt|2.60|m}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="cci"/&gt; The third floor contains three rooms including two large ones. On the fourth floor, there is a residence room of size {{cvt|5|x|5|m}} and a [[chapel]].&lt;ref name="cci"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

The cave monastery has been known since the 1950s.&lt;ref name="cci"/&gt; It is assumed that it was heavily used by Christians for a while.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; It is likely that the place was inhabited from the 4th century until the end of the 12th century, and was used as a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[monastery]].&lt;ref name="sl"/&gt; However, archaeological excavations carried out between 1992 and 1995 revealed that the area was settled even much earlier.&lt;ref name="cci"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ad"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">'''Center Forward''' is an American [[political action committee]] advocating centrist policies in the [[United States]] government. The organization has roots in the [[Blue Dog Coalition]] of centrist [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] who hold some common views with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] counterparts. The organization’s mission is to promote business growth and maintain fiscal responsibility while also promoting meaningful reforms. After the Blue Dog Coalition whittled in members, the organization was founded to promote more centrist views among the party. Blue Dog members have noted that Center Forward could be the path towards the return of a Democratic majority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/blue-dog-democrats-whittled-down-in-number-are-trying-to-regroup/2014/01/15/37d4e7e2-7dfd-11e3-95c6-0a7aa80874bc_story.html Kane, Paul; Blue Dog Democrats, whittled down in number, are trying to regroup; ''The Washington Post''; January 15, 2014;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drusch, Andrea; Rampy, Northrop hang a shingle — Cornyn cousel heads to Abbott — K2&amp;Co. launches policy blog — Scott Brown steering committee hosts Dubliner reception; Politico; March 28, 2014; https://www.politico.com/tipsheets/politico-influence/2014/03/rampy-northrop-hang-a-shingle-cornyn-cousel-heads-to-abbott-k2-co-launches-policy-blog-scott-brown-steering-committee-hosts-dubliner-reception-212543 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Castañeda, Leonardo; Private money funds $38K in travel by San Diego House members, staff; inewsource; August 25, 2017; https://inewsource.org/2017/08/25/private-travel-house-members/ &lt;/ref&gt;

Center Forward has endorsed various politicians, including [[John Barrow (U.S. politician)|John Barrow]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]’s 2014 elections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/10/21/democrats-tout-student-loan-issues-ryan-budget-higher-ed-cuts-political-ads Stratford, Michael; Student Loans and Political Ads; ''Inside Higher Ed''; October 21, 2014;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Center Forward reportedly spent $1 million on national television ads promoting a bipartisan approach to balancing the budget.

'''''Confessions Illustrated''''' was a black-and-white magazine published by [[EC Comics]] in early 1956. Part of EC's Picto-Fiction line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The format alternated blocks of text with several illustrations per page.

The first issue had a cover date of January–February 1956, but the second issue was the last. A third issue existed but was not printed by EC. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and the line was canceled when EC's distributor went bankrupt.

''Confessions Illustrated'' was edited by [[Al Feldstein]]. The stories were written by [[Daniel Keyes]]. Artists featured include Bud Parke, [[Jack Kamen]], [[Joe Orlando]], [[Wally Wood]], [[Johnny Craig]], [[Rudy Nappi]] and [[Reed Crandall]].

In 2006 ''Confessions Illustrated'' was reprinted along with the other [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] magazines by publisher [[Russ Cochran (publisher)|Russ Cochran]] (and [[Gemstone Publishing]]) in hardbound volumes as the final part of his '''Complete EC Library'''. The reprint volume included the previously unpublished third issue of ''Confessions Illustrated''.

The '''conservation and restoration of silver objects''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and [[Silver (household)|personal value]] made from [[silver]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

Historically, objects made from silver were created for religious, artistic, technical, and domestic uses. The act of [[conservation and restoration]] strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. The prevention and removal of surface tarnish is the primary concern of conservator-restorers when dealing with silver objects.

== Use of silver ==
[[Silver]] is a [[precious metal]] that has been mined for use as early as 4000 B.C. in [[Anatolia]] (Modern [[Turkey]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 History of Silver|url=http://www.925-1000.com/silverhistory.html |publisher=The Silver Institute|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because silver is malleable and durable it has been used for many purposes which include [[jewelry]], tableware, ornaments, [[coin]]s, musical instruments and [[movie film]]. It is often used as a plating on other metals.

==Tarnish==
{{About||additional information|tarnish}} 
All metals, apart from pure gold, will corrode naturally when exposed to elements such as air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberge|first=Pierre|title=Gold Corrosion|url=http://corrosion-doctors.org/MatSelect/corrgold.htm|publisher=Corrosion Doctors|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; High relative humidity, moisture, and air pollutants  are common causes of corrosion in metals, including silver.&lt;ref name=Erhardt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erhardt|first=David|author2=Charles S. Tumosa and Marion F. Mecklenburg|title=Applying science to the question of museum climate|journal=Museum Microclimates|year=2007|series=National Museum of Denmark|pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Silver is known in the chemistry world as a [[noble metal]] which means it is resistant to corrosion, but not completely.  Whether [[silver plating]] or pure silver, the composite of the metal will [[tarnish]] when exposed to air and sulfur.

Tarnish is a chemical reaction on the surface of metal (copper, brass, silver, etc.) and causes a layer of corrosion. In the case of silver tarnish, the silver combines with sulfur and forms [[silver sulfide]] ( Ag2S ) which is black. The original silver surface can be restored if the layer of silver sulfide is removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At Home Experiment: Put a Shine on it|url=http://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/homeexpts/TARNISH.html|publisher=SciFun|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On some metals, tarnish serves as a protective layer known as a [[patina]] and is typically found on copper and bronze roofing, architectural elements, statues and bells.

== Collections care ==
{{Main article|Collections care}}

===Storage and handling ===
Proper handling, storage, and treatment can help prevent deterioration of silver objects.&lt;ref name="Erhardt"/&gt; Metals are best conserved when stored in an even and low humidity atmosphere, ideally at 40% [[relative humidity]] or lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver tends to corrode easily when stored in damp, moist locations such as a basement because it will accelerate tarnishing. Some storage boxes contain  materials, such as wood, acidic paper, rubber, and adhesives, that can off-gas corrosive materials. Conservators wear [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile]] gloves when handling silver to prevent oils, ammonia, and salts from the skin from corroding the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventing interaction with sulfur gases===
Sulfur-containing gases and particulates can tarnish the surface of silver. These corrosive agents can come from air pollution, paints, textiles, bacterial by-products, and other chemically treated objects or building materials. When storing silver, museum conservators wrap silver in [[sulfur]]-free tissue paper and store in a tight sealed [[polyethylene]] bag. [[Activated charcoal]] is sometimes used to absorb sulfur by placing it in the bag but not in direct contact with the object. Likewise, Pacific Silver Cloth has also been used by museums to prevent tarnishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacquering===
{{About||lacquering|lacquer|other uses|lacquerware}}
[[Lacquer]]ing is the process of creating a hard durable finish on the surface of an object such as wood or metal.
Polished silver is sometimes lacquered to protect against tarnish and to prevent over-polishing. There are different types of [[resin]]s that are used such as Acryloid B-72 and Incralac. If silver pieces are being displayed in the open, such as in a house or museum exhibit case, it is difficult to prevent corrosion from air exposure. A surface coating will prevent or slow tarnishing and is a service done by professionals or conservator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |pages=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most used coatings is Agateen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=Beverly|title=The De-electrification and Re-electrification of Historic Lighting Fixtures at Winterthur Museum|journal=Journal of the American Institute of Conservation|year=2003|volume=42|series=6|issue=3|pages=457–462|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic42-03-006_3.html|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacquer is applied to a surface that has been cleaned with [[ethanol]], [[acetone]], or [[methyl ethyl ketone]]. Oils from human hands prevent the lacquer from adhering to the silver. Agateen No. 27 ([[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]]) and [[Paraloid B-72]] are the most commonly used lacquers however there is a debate which lacquer, cellulose nitrate or acrylic, is best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wharton|first=Glenn|title=The Cleaning and Lacquering of Museum silver|journal=Western Association for Art Conservation|date=Jan 1989|volume=11|issue=1|pages=4–5|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn11/wn11-1/wn11-103.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historic methods of treating silver ==
The art of crafting objects out of silver, also known as [[silversmith]]ing, has been around for centuries. With the creation of hand-made silver objects, the issue of cleaning and caring for these items was a concern. Silversmiths would give advice to clients on how to properly care for their silver. Here are examples of instructions given by silversmiths in the 17th and 18th centuries.

: 1737 - "Clean it now and then with only warm water and soap, with a Spunge, and then wash it  with clean water, and dry it very well with a soft Linnen cloth, and keep it in a dry place, for the damp will spoyle it".&lt;ref name="Cripps 1967 17–18"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cripps|first=Wilfred|title=Old English Plate|year=1967|publisher=Spring Books|location=London|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1679 - "...rubb the [[flagon]]s and [[chalice]]s from topp to the Bottome, not crosswise, but the Bason and patnes are to be rubb’d roundwise, not acrosse, and by noe means use either [[chalk]], [[sand]], or [[salt]]" &lt;ref name="Cripps 1967 17–18"/&gt;

Although dated, these instructions are very similar to current methods of cleaning and polishing of silver.

== Current practices ==
The following sections discuss the different methods in which silver objects can be cleaned and polished. Some of the methods described below can cause damage to the surface of the silver, such as scratching or accelerated tarnishing. A conservator should be consulted if there are any questions about the methods below especially when dealing with archaeological, antique or sensitive objects.&lt;ref name=cfs/&gt;

===Museum conservation practices – historical objects===

Water sensitive objects are masked in plastic wrap to avoid getting wet. A [[slurry]] of precipitated (pharmaceutical grade) [[calcium carbonate]] and [[deionized water]] is created and rubbed onto the silver piece with a cotton rag or cotton ball. It is recommended that the slurry be tested on the bottom or in a non-visible area of the silver for abrasiveness. If the slurry is too abrasive it will scratch the surface and increase the potential for future tarnishing. The polish is applied with a soft cloth and polished in a circular motion.&lt;ref name=draymanwesser&gt;{{cite book|last=Drayman-Weisser|first=T|title=Caring for Your Collections|year=1992|publisher=Harry N. Abrams Incorp|location=New York|pages=109–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Unpolished and polished silver artwork pieces.jpg|left|thumb|Parts of a silver object from [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] collection, in the process of being polished with [[calcium carbonate]]. An unpolished piece  is on the left and a finished piece on the right.]]

[[Ethyl alcohol]] is sometimes added to the slurry mixture to help dry out excess water.  The slurry mixture is applied throughout the piece until completely polished. Dark tarnish spots are sometimes located on the surface and may need to be polished more than once to remove. Over polishing is an issue with silver and can cause harm to the surface of the metal. After polishing, the silver object is rinsed in deionized water and dried with a cotton cloth.&lt;ref name=cfs&gt;{{cite web|last=National Park Service|title=Caring for Silver and Copper Alloy Materials|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/10-02.pdf|work=Conserve O Gram|publisher=NPS|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once cleaned and dried the silver is wrapped in [[acid-free]] tissue paper and placed in a sealed plastic bag. A [[3M]] anti-tarnish strip is also placed in the bag to absorb any sulfur that may be in the air. The tissue paper is used as a buffer to prevent the silver surface coming into contact with the anti-tarnish strip.&lt;ref name=draymanwesser/&gt;

===Waddings===
Waddings are cloths that have been infused with an organic [[solvent]]. Because they contain solvents instead of water, they can be used for polishing metal objects that cannot be exposed to water. Polishing waddings will leave abrasive particles behind and the residue can be  removed using a soft brush or by rubbing the surface with a soft [[linen]] cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Selwyn|first=L|title=Care and Tarnish Removal|url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/publications/notes/9-7_e.pdf|publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=4 March 2012|date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural methods===
The following sections include methods that use natural methods such as water and salt to clean the surface of silver. Some of the methods use heat which may be dangerous to silver tableware such as candlesticks or knife handles. Water trapped in crevices of silver objects can accelerate tarnishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Single Ingredient'' - [[Toothpaste]] is applied with a clean cloth as a gentle abrasive with a soft bristle toothbrush and rinsed in water.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt;

''Boiling Water Bath'' - The silver object or pieces are placed into an aluminum pot and covered with water. One [[tablespoon]] of salt and [[baking soda]] is added and boiled for three minutes. After cooling, the silver is placed into a warm soapy water mixture and cleaned with a cotton cloth and then dried with a separate cotton cloth.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt; 

''Soaking bath'' – A glass roasting pan is lined with [[aluminum foil]] with the dull side facing downwards. The silver is placed atop of the foil and a [[quart]] of boiling water is poured over the pieces with two tablespoons of baking soda. The silver soaks for five minutes and is dried with a clean cloth.&lt;ref name=natural&gt;{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Ellen|title=All Natural Way to Clean Tarnished Silver|url=http://greenliving.nationalgeographic.com/allnatural-way-clean-tarnished-silver-3214.html|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical dips===
A popular and quick method for polishing silver is the use of chemical dips. Dips work by dissolving the tarnished surface of the silver at a highly accelerated rate. Many dips are made of [[acid]]s and other agents. Acids are very corrosive and pose a danger to the silver surface as well as to the user. Dips can be harmful to objects with sealed surfaces such as candlesticks, trophies and teapots with hollow components because the chemical could leak into the hollow area and can never be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herman|first=Jeffrey|title=Silver Care|url=http://www.silversmithing.com/care.htm#Chemical%20Dips|publisher=Society of Silversmiths|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike museum quality polishing, employing a slurry of calcium carbonate and ionized water, dips are quicker and less expensive. However, dips are more abrasive to the surfaces of silver, gold, and other metals. NOTE: Jeffrey Herman confirms this method damages silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tarn-X Tarnish Remover Review and Other Silver Dips - WARNING! |url=http://www.hermansilver.com/tarn-x.htm |website=www.hermansilver.com |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laser cleaning===
Can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=SALIMBENI |first1=RENZO |title=LASER TECHNIQUES FOR CONSERVATION OF ARTWORKS |url=http://www.ace.hu/am/2006_1/AM-2006-1-RS.pdf |publisher=Institute of Applied Physics “Nello Carrara”- CNR, |accessdate=1 October 2013 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The above process wil naturally lead to the cleaning of silver, which is passed through lasers to remove any dirt and pollutants.

===Plasma cleaning===
Can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schmidt-Otta |first1=K |title=Plasma-Reduction: Its Potential for Use in the Conservation of Metals |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/346055/NMA_metals_s3_p01_plasma_reduction.pdf |accessdate=1 October 2013 |date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panna-project.eu/work-packages/wp-3/cleaning-of-a-tarnished-daguerreotype.html |title=Cleaning treatment of a tarnished Daguerreotype by using the reducing afterglow of an atmospheric plasma |accessdate=2013-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927080603/http://www.panna-project.eu/work-packages/wp-3/cleaning-of-a-tarnished-daguerreotype.html |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}  Accessed 1.10.2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Plasma cleaning

===Polishing wheels===
{{About||metal polishing|polishing (metalworking)|other uses|polishing}}
Polishing wheels, also known as buffing wheels or polishing mops, use a specific electric tool to physically remove tarnish from the surface rather than chemically as with the calcium carbonate slurry or commercial dips.&lt;ref name=wheel/&gt;

Because silver is soft,  the surface can be easily cut or scratched. The main buffing type used for silver, gold, and plated objects is Canton flannel. This flannel is made of very soft material and will not scratch the plated, lacquered, or other soft surfaces.&lt;ref name=wheel/&gt;

Along with buffing wheels, particular compounds are used to help polish the material. Two main types of compounds used for silver and gold surfaces are red and blue compounds. Red, also known as [[jeweler's rouge]], polishes without any cutting action. The blue compound is a dryer compound and is used with a grease-less wheel that also does not cut or scratch the surface.&lt;ref name=wheel&gt;{{cite web|last=Caswell Electroplating in Miniature|title=How to Buff and Polish: An Introduction to Buffing &amp; Polishing|url=http://www.caswellplating.com/buffman.htm|publisher=Caswell Inc.|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum conservation practices - Archaeology objects==
[[File:Miletopoli (oggi mysia in turchia), medaglioni ellenistici in argento, II-I sec ac. 02.JPG|thumb|right|Hellenistic silver medallion, partly gilt, Miletopoli,2nd-1st centuries BC,after conservation, Antikensammlung Berlin]]
Archaeological silver objects are particularly sensitive to mistakes in planning or carrying out conservation restoration. The essential problem connected with archaeological silver objects is brittleness.&lt;ref&gt;Wanhill, R.J.H., 2000, Brittle archaeological silver. Identification, restoration and conservation, Materialen, 16, 30– 5; also NLR Technical Publication NLR.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain objects, such as those that are completely mineralized, nielloed, or gil, are particularly problematic.  When dealing with archaeological objects, reversible processes, such as the use of Paraloid B-72 glue, are preferred to permanent treatments.

Benzotriazole can be used as corrosion inhibitor for archaeological importance. Suitable protective coatings include Paraloid B-72 (or Paraloid B 67 - soluble in white spirit) and Renaissance Wax.

'''''EASE Guidelines for Authors and Translators of Scientific Articles to be Published in English''''' (often shortened to '''''EASE Guidelines for Authors and Translators''''' or '''''EASE Guidelines''''') were first published by the [[European Association of Science Editors]] (EASE) in 2010.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;Ufnalska S. 2010.

They also support the global initiative [[Healthcare Information For All by 2015]] by advising authors to make [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] of their papers highly informative, reliable, and easily understandable. The document has been translated into many languages ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Bengali language|Bangla]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[English language|English]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ([[Brazil]]ian), [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]), to facilitate its popularization worldwide and help scientists from non-[[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries.&lt;ref name=CSE&gt; Ufnalska S.B. 2011.

== History ==
''EASE Guidelines'' are a result of long discussions on the electronic [[European Association of Science Editors|EASE]] Forum and during the [[European_Association_of_Science_Editors#2009 conference: Integrity in Science Communication|2009 EASE conference in Pisa]], as well as subsequent consultations within the EASE Council.&lt;ref&gt;Ufnalska S. 2010. 
{{cite web|url= http://www.ease.org.uk/pdfese/ESE_may10.pdf |title=Major editorial guidelines need to be translated and popularized. }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|( 1.1 MB
)}} ''European Science Editing'' 36(2): 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==

The document includes a succinct set of practical guidelines explaining how to write complete, concise and clear manuscripts (see a [http://www.ease.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Sylwia-Ufnalska-EASE-2016.pdf short presentation]). It is supplemented with a list for further reading as well as several short appendices (Abstracts; Ambiguity; Cohesion; Ethics; Plurals; Simplicity; Spelling; Text-tables) that present selected issues in greater detail or provide more examples.

''EASE Guidelines'' emphasize the need for proper structuring of the [[Academic paper#Scholarly paper|article]] (e.g. making the tested hypothesis clear in the Introduction), making the [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] highly informative (including most important [[data]] and conclusions), and writing understandably, so that the readers are not discouraged or confused. Ethical issues are also taken into account, e.g. authorship criteria, [[plagiarism]], redundant publications, and other types of [[scientific misconduct]]. The 2013 edition of the publication ethics checklist ([https://web.archive.org/web/20140810105700/http://www.ease.org.uk/sites/default/files/ease_guidelines-june2014-ethics.pdf Appendix: Ethics], page 10 of ''EASE Guidelines'') was presented at the 3rd World Conference on Research Integrity in Montreal in May 2013. It can be used routinely during submission, as one short form instead of many separate forms to be filled by authors.

== Perspectives ==

The [[European Association of Science Editors|EASE]] Council plans to add more appendices on specific subjects and more translations (made mostly by volunteers), as well as to review ''EASE Guidelines'' annually.&lt;ref name=LP /&gt;

Non-commercial [[printing]] of the document is allowed, so it can be used as a [[handout]], e.g. for [[postgraduate education|courses]] in [[scientific literature|scientific writing]] and [[scientific misconduct|publication ethics]].&lt;ref name="CSE" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1793">'''Echetlaeus''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἐχετλαῖος) or '''Echetlus''' (Ἔχετλος) was an [[Ancient Athens|ancient Athenian]] mythical hero of the  [[Battle of Marathon]] with the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians of the Achaemenid Empire]]. The latter name was also the name of a hero of ancient Thebes.

==The hero of the Athenians==
The following tradition was current in ancient Athens after the Battle of Marathon. 

During the battle, a man appeared among the Athenians, who resembled a rustic, and slew many of the Persians with his plough. After the battle, he disappeared. When the Athenians searched for him, they couldn't find him anywhere.When they consulted the [[oracle]], they were commanded to worship the hero Echetlaeus, that is the hero with the ''echetlon'', or [[ploughshare]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 1.32.5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AgoraAthens5thcentury.png|thumb|Plan showing the major buildings of the Agora; the Stoa Poikile is number 20]]
This Echetlus was depicted in the painting which represented the Battle of Marathon in the [[Stoa Poikile]] (Painted Porch), erected during the 5th century BC and located in the [[Ancient Agora of Athens]]. The Stoa Poikile was one of the most famous sites in ancient Athens, due to its display of war-related paintings and loot.

==Echetlus of Thebes==
In addition, in the play ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]'', '''Echetlus''' is the name of one of the defenders of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. He is killed when the seven attacked the city.&lt;ref&gt;Statius, Thebaid, 10.296 [http://www.theoi.com/Text/StatiusThebaid10.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
A '''Faqeeh''' (plural ''Fuqahā'', {{lang-ar|[[wikt:فقيه|فقيه]], pl. فقهاء}}) is an ''Islamic jurist'', an expert in [[fiqh]], or [[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]] and [[Islamic Law]].

==Definition==
{{main article|fiqh}}

[[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/207723/fiqh Fiqh] Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; or fiqh is the human understanding of the [[Sharia]] (believed by Muslims to represent divine law as revealed in the [[Quran]] and the ''[[Sunnah]]'' (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]))&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Frank E.|title=Islamic Law and the Legal System of Saudí: Studies of Saudi Arabia|date=2000|publisher=Brill|pages=4–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-PfDuvnHMGoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=vogel+islamic+law#v=onepage&amp;q=vogel%20islamic%20law&amp;f=false|isbn=9004110623}}&lt;/ref&gt; —sharia expanded and developed by interpretation (''[[ijtihad]]'') of the Quran and ''Sunnah'' by Islamic jurists (''[[Ulema]]'')&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt; and implemented by the rulings (''[[Fatwa]]'') of jurists on questions presented to them.

''Fiqh'' deals with the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. In the modern era there are four prominent schools (''[[madh'hab]]'') of ''fiqh'' within [[Sunni]] practice and two (or three) within [[Shi'a]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;Glasse, Cyril, ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Altamira, 2001, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] describes ''fiqh'' as "knowledge of the rules of God which concern the actions of persons who own themselves bound to obey the law respecting what is required (''[[wajib]]''), sinful (''[[haraam]]''), recommended (''[[mustahab|mandūb]]''), disapproved (''[[makrūh]]'') or neutral (''[[mubah]]'')".&lt;ref&gt;Levy (1957). Page 150.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is consistent amongst the jurists.

Another definition of ''Fiqh'' is "Knowledge of legislative rulings, pertaining to the actions of man, as derived from their detailed evidences."&lt;ref name=Kulseth-440&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kulseth|first1=P. M.|title=Redeemed: The Saga of Eyja's Family in Iceland and the Muslim World|date=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|page=440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PqkZp1ElMmcC&amp;pg=PA440&amp;dq=fiqh+Knowledge+of+legislative+rulings,+pertaining+to+the+actions+of+man,+as+derived+from+their+detailed+evidences&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIiP3lg9XqxwIVTwWSCh21vwQf#v=onepage&amp;q=fiqh%20Knowledge%20of%20legislative%20rulings%2C%20pertaining%20to%20the%20actions%20of%20man%2C%20as%20derived%20from%20their%20detailed%20evidences&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

*"Legislative rulings..." here excludes rulings that are purely theoretical in nature, such as those found in the science of ''Usul Al Fiqh'', as well as those theological in nature, generally discussed in the books of [[Aqidah]] or [[Kalam]].
*"derived from their detailed evidences" here connotes two things:
#that there is a method of derivation; and,
#that the source for such derivation are the various evidences considered valid Islamically.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Methods of derivation==
Methods of derivation are laid out in the books of ''Usul Al Fiqh'' (principles of fiqh), and those evidences which are deemed valid for deriving rulings from are many in number. Four of them are agreed upon by the vast Majority of Jurists, they are:
* The [[Qur'an]]
* The [[Hadith|Sunnah]]
* [[Ijma']] or Consensus
* [[Qiyas]] or Analogy

These four types of evidence are seen as acceptable by the vast majority of Jurists from both the schools of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Jurists (the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Hanbali]] and sometimes the [[Zahiriyah]]), as well as [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] Jurists.  However, [[Zahiriyah]] or Literalists do not see [[Qiyas]] as valid.

While Twelver Shia see edicts of the [[Twelvers|Twelve]] Imams as holding the same weight as the Quran and Sunnah, this is unacceptable by Sunni Jurists.

==Conditions for being a Faqeeh==
The Faqeeh is one who has fulfilled the conditions for [[Ijtihad]] either in their entirety or in piecemeal.  In the Sunni point of view it is generally held that there are either no (or very few) Jurists or Fuqaha that have reached the level of Mujtahid Mutlaq in our day and age. In the [[Twelver]] (Ithna Asheri) Shia view, each of their [[Marja']] have reached this level.

The Faqeeh who fulfills all conditions of Ijtihad is sometimes referred to as a ''Mujtahid Mutlaq'' or Unrestricted Jurist-Scholar, while he who has not reached that level generally will master of the methodology (''Usul'') used by one or more of the prominent ''madhhab'' and then able to apply this methodology to arrive at the traditional legal rulings of his/her respective madhhab. According to the Sunni Muslim website Living Islam, "There is no mujtahid mutlaq today nor even a claimant to that title."&lt;ref name=Haddad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haddad|first1=GF|title=What is the definition of a mujtahid mutlaq, and are there any today.|url=http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/fiqha_e60.html|website=livingislam.org|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the level of Mujtahid Mutlaq is the ''Mujtahid Muqayyad'' or a Restricted Jurist-Scholar.  A ''Mujtahid Muqayyad'' must pass rulings according to the confines of his particular [[madhhab]] (school of jurisprudence), or particular area of specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sunni Path|publisher=Hakikat Kitapevi.|page=33|edition=15th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0RsuasOoNH0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%27%27%27Mujtahid+Muqayyad%27%27%27&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI2Jr359nqxwIV0X-SCh3DFwEP#v=onepage&amp;q=%27%27%27Mujtahid%20Muqayyad%27%27%27&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is according to the view that Ijtihad or the ability of legal deduction can be achieved in specified areas, and does not require a holistic grasp of the [[Shariah]] and its entailing Laws and legal theory.

'''Gallus Mag''' (real name unknown) was a 6-foot-tall plus female [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] at a 19th century [[New York City]] [[Water Street (Manhattan)|Water Street]] [[bar (establishment)|bar]] called "[[The Hole in the Wall (New York bar)|The Hole in the Wall]]", who figures prominently in New York City [[folklore]].

==Bar bouncer==
[[Herbert Asbury]]'s book ''[[The Gangs of New York (book)|The Gangs of New York]]'' thus described her:

:''"It was her custom, after she'd felled an obstreperous customer with her club, to clutch his ear between her teeth and so drag him to the door, amid the frenzied cheers of the onlookers. If her victim protested she bit his ear off, and having cast the fellow into the street she carefully deposited the detached member in a jar of alcohol behind the bar…. She was one of the most feared denizens on the waterfront and the police of the period shudderingly described her as the most savage female they'd ever encountered."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Asbury|Asbury, Herbert]]. ''The Gangs of New York''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928; {{ISBN|978-1-56025-275-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gender Balance Council''' (Arabic: &lt;span lang="ar" dir="ltr"&gt;مجلس الإمارات للتوازن بين الجنسين ''majlis al-ʾimārāt lit-tawāzun bayna al-jinsayn'')&lt;/span&gt; is a federal entity in the UAE. According to Sheikha Jawaher bint Mohammed Al Qasimi, the Gender Balance Council seeks [[empowering women]] and enhancing their role in the development of the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/uaes-gender-balance-council-will-empower-women-sheikha-jawaher-says|title=Gender Balance Council will empower women, Sheikha Jawaher says|website=The National|accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the country, more women graduate from universities than; however, social and legal constrains are put on women's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-31658184|title=Working Emirati women to get 'gender balance' council - BBC News|accessdate=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GBC is chaired by President of [[Dubai Women Establishment]], [[Manal bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Shaikha Manal bint Mohammed Al Maktoum]]. Currently 41st on the international gender equality index, the UAE is set to be one of the world’s top 25 by the year 2021.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History and mission ==
The UAE Gender Balance&amp;nbsp;Council was created by virtue of a Cabinet resolution issued in February 2015. "The focus of the GBC is [[Women's empowerment|women empowerment]] in order to achieve more development in the country.&lt;ref name="ftn3"&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/uaes-gender-balance-council-will-empower-women-sheikha-jawaher-says&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structure ===
As of 2016, the hierarchy of the council includes 
* Noura Al Suwaidi, the head of the General Women’s Union
* Reem Abdullah Eisa Al Falasi, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood,
* Mona El Mari the executive director of Dubai Women Establishment
* Abdullah Nasser Lutah, the secretary general of the Emirates Competitiveness Council
In addition to representatives of presidency affairs ministries, cabinet affairs and ministries of foreign affairs, economics, social affairs, labor and the federal committee for human resources.

=== Mission and role ===
The Gender Balance Council's goal is to achieve female empowerment.&lt;ref name="ftn4"&gt;http://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/government/shaikh-mohammed-forms-uae-gender-balance-council&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the GBC was announced by Sh. Mohammed during a session, "Toward Gender Balance in Governments", on the role of women in development and the UAE’s international competitiveness.&lt;ref name="ftn6"&gt;https://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates/1395276338717.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The GBC’s role consists of bridging the gap between women and men and enhancing the UAE’s global status in the matter. The GBC undertakes several legal roles, notably review of legislation introduced and policies proposed in the matter of gender balance, but also seeks to balance rights like nationality rights, divorce rights, [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|guardianship]] and custody rights, inheritance rights, freedom of movement, protection from child, marriage, and protection from [[gender-based violence]].&lt;ref name="ftn8"&gt;http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/UAE-Gender-Eqaulity-Profile-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Set by [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|ruler of Dubai]], a goal for the UAE to become one of the world’s top 25 countries for gender equality by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government's measures ==
The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) upholds the principle of equal treatment of all citizens, but does not specifically address gender-based discrimination and contains references that primarily identify women as wives and mothers.As such, the Constitution, as well as other laws, tends to reinforce traditional gender roles, rather than promoting equality between women and men in the UAE. Aware of this situation, the United Arab Emirates tends to make the necessary and possible legal amendment to surpass any noted shortage in gender balance.

The General Women’s Union is a national organization which launched the “Know your Rights” campaign with MEPI in October 2009 to empower Emirati women to understand their rights, under UAE law and international conventions, and increase their [[awareness]] of the current personal status law in the UAE, as issued in 2006, and its application. The strategy aims at activating the role of women in the UAE and ensuring their positive participation in eight key areas: education, economy, media, social work, health; legislation; environment as well as political and executive fields.&lt;ref name="ftn9"&gt;http://abudhabi.usembassy.gov/mepi-women-rights2/uae-women-learn-their-rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016 the GBC announced the establishment of a committee to review the law and to activate the Gender Balance Index across various sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/government/uae-to-review-maternity-law-activate-gender-balance-index|title=UAE to review maternity law, activate Gender Balance Index - Khaleej Times|last=Reporter|first=Staff|accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's '[[Ministry of Happiness]]' is headed by [[Ohoud Al Roumi]], while five roles in the new cabinet went to women as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emirateswoman.com/minister-happiness-revealed-ohood-al-roumi/|title=Ohood Al Roumi Named Minister Of Happiness – Emirates Woman|accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil society and women rights ==
The UAE encourages the creation of NGO’s that defend women rights as a very effective manner to guarantee that the [[Demographics of the United Arab Emirates|Emirati society]] adopt the values that champion human rights in general, notably women rights.

The GBC has a priority of creating a supportive environment for women and working "to alter stereotypes" about Arab women.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emirati women education ==
The literacy rate of women in the UAE was 80.7 percent in 2003, higher than the male literacy rate of 75.6 percent. Across all institutions of higher education in the UAE,&amp;nbsp;including both Federal and private institutions, the total number of UAE National women enrolled in higher education is approximately 190 percent of the number of UAE National males.

== Maternity leave ==
In August 2016,The GBC announced it would review the country’s maternity law, and some private sector firms have already enhanced their policies. Dubai-based [[Omnicom Group|Omnicom]] Media Group MENA recently increased entitlement to 90 days, following a number of requests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipd.ae/people-management-magazine/hr-news-opinion/maternity-leave-abu-dhabi|title=Maternity leave extended for government employees in Abu Dhabi|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ginger Group''' was not a formal political party in [[Canada]], but a [[Political factions|faction]] of radical [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive]] and [[Labour Party of Canada|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] who advocated [[socialism]]. The term [[ginger group]] also refers to a small group with new, radical ideas trying to act as a catalyst within a larger body.

The Ginger Group split with the Progressive Party in 1924 when Progressive leader [[Robert Forke]] proved too eager to accommodate the Liberal government of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and agreed to support the government's budget with only minimal concessions. [[J. S. Woodsworth]], using his right as the leader of the Independent Labour MPs, moved a stronger amendment to the budget based on demands the Progressives had made in earlier years but had since abandoned. The Progressive and Labour MPs who broke with their Progressive colleagues to support Woodsworth became the "Ginger Group".&lt;ref name=irvine&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMLs5Gbq5wC&amp;pg=PA133 |title=William Irvine: the Life of a Prairie Radical |first=Anthony |last=Mardiros |publisher=James Lorimer &amp; Co |location=Tonornto |date=1979 |pages=132-140 |isbn=978-0-8886-2237-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=agnes&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nlnmjRt71oC&amp;pg=PA75 |title=Agnes Macphail and the Politics of Equality |first=Terence Allan |last=Crowley |page=75-77 |publisher=James Lorimer &amp; Co |location=Tonornto |date=1990 |isbn=978-1-5502-8326-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made up of [[United Farmers of Alberta]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s [[George Gibson Coote]], [[Robert Gardiner (Canadian politician)|Robert Gardiner]], [[Edward Joseph Garland]], [[Donald MacBeth Kennedy]] and [[Henry Elvins Spencer]] as well as [[United Farmers of Ontario]] MP [[Agnes Macphail]]. The group was later joined by [[Labour Party of Canada|Labour]] MPs J. S. Woodsworth, [[William Irvine (Canada)|William Irvine]], [[Abraham Albert Heaps]] and [[Angus MacInnis]], independent MP [[Joseph Tweed Shaw]] and [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive]] MPs [[Milton Neil Campbell]], [[William John Ward]], [[William Charles Good]], and [[Preston Elliott]].&lt;ref name=irvine/&gt;&lt;ref name=agnes/&gt;&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ginger Group |work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |edition=online |date=2015-03-04 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/ginger-group/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Ginger Group played a role in forming the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] in 1932, with Woodsworth becoming the new party's leader.&lt;ref name=irvine/&gt;

The only sitting United Farmers of Alberta who did not join the CCF at its founding was [[William Thomas Lucas]] who ran for re-election unsuccessfully as a Conservative in 1935.

The name Ginger Group was also used to refer to a group of [[Conservative Party of Canada (historic)|Conservative]] MPs who, in 1917 opposed [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Borden]]'s use of the [[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]] to introduce [[conscription]] during the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]].&lt;ref name=agnes/&gt;&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

'''''I Am Legend''''' is a 2007 American [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction]] [[drama film]] based on the [[I Am Legend (novel)|novel of the same name]], directed by [[Francis Lawrence]] and starring [[Will Smith]], who plays [[United States Army|US Army]] [[virology|virologist]] Robert Neville. The story is set in [[New York City]] after a virus, which was originally created to cure cancer, has wiped out most of mankind, leaving Neville as the last human in New York, other than nocturnal mutants.  Neville is immune to the virus and he works to develop a cure while defending himself against the hostile mutants.

[[Warner Bros.]] began developing ''I Am Legend'' in 1994, and various actors and directors were attached to the project, though production was delayed due to budgetary concerns related to the script. Production began in 2006 in [[New York City]], filming mainly on location in the city, including a $5 million scene&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 | title=A 'Legend' in the Making | work=The Hollywood Reporter | accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011204523/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].

The film was released on December 14, 2007, in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and opened to the largest ever [[box office]] (not adjusted for [[inflation]]) for a non-[[Christmas]] film released in the U.S. in December. The film was the seventh-[[2007 in film#Top grossing films|highest grossing film of 2007]], earning $256 million domestically and $329 million internationally, for a total of $585 million.

In 2009, a [[genetic engineering|genetically re-engineered]] [[measles]] [[virus]], originally created as a [[Cancer research|cure for cancer]], turns into a lethal strain which kills 90% of those it infects, mutates over 9% into predatory, nocturnal and [[vampiric]] mutants, called Darkseekers, who are extremely vulnerable to sunlight, with less than 1% immune. Three years after the outbreak, [[United States Army|US Army]] virologist [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Robert Neville ([[Will Smith]]) lives an isolated life in the deserted ruins of [[New York City]], unsure if any other uninfected humans are left in the world.

Neville's daily routine includes experimentation on infected rats to find a cure to the virus and venturing through [[Manhattan]] to search for food and supplies, as well as waiting each day for any human survivors who have responded to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which instruct any uninfected people to meet him at midday at the [[South Street Seaport]].

Flashbacks reveal that his wife ([[Salli Richardson]]) and daughter ([[Willow Smith]]) died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan, prior to the military-enforced [[quarantine]] of the island in 2009, when Neville stayed behind on the island as military personnel.  Neville's only mitigation for his loneliness is his [[German Shepherd]] named Samantha, a.k.a. Sam (given to him by his daughter as a puppy to protect him before she died in the helicopter crash), interaction with [[mannequins]] he has set up as patrons at a video store, and recordings of old television broadcasts. At night, he barricades himself and Sam inside his heavily fortified [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]] home to hide from the Darkseekers. One day, while waiting for survivors, Sam follows a deer into a dark building. Neville cautiously goes in after her and finds the deer's corpse along with Sam, but the building is infested by a colony of Darkseekers. Both manage to escape unharmed and the attacking Darkseekers are killed by the sunlight.

&lt;!--all edits to trap section need to be [[WP:SYNTH]] free. Please do not speculate on who set the second trap and motives of the infected--&gt;
Neville finds a promising treatment derived from his own blood, so he sets a [[Animal trapping#Snares|snare trap]] and captures a female Darkseeker from the colony building, while a male Darkseeker (termed "Alpha Male" in the script, and played by [[Dash Mihok]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-1aM7D_ymdAC&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=201|title=Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 2010|author=Roger Ebert|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date= 9 Nov 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; tries to go after them, but is blocked by the sunlight and returns to the shadows. Back in his laboratory in the basement of his house, Neville treats the female without success. The next day, he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the female; by the time he manages to escape, the sun is setting and he is attacked by infected dogs. Neville and Sam manage to eliminate them, but Sam is bitten in the fight. Neville injects her with a strand of his serum, but when she shows signs of infection, Neville is forced to strangle her to death. Heartbroken and driven over the edge of insanity by his dog's death, he ventures out and suicidally attacks a group of Darkseekers the next night. He kills a large number of Darkseekers but the rest overwhelm him and he is nearly killed, but is rescued by a pair of immune survivors, Anna ([[Alice Braga]]) and a young boy named Ethan ([[Charlie Tahan]]), who have traveled from [[Maryland]] after hearing one of his broadcasts. They take the injured Neville back to his home, where Anna explains that they survived the outbreak aboard a [[Red Cross]] evacuation ship from [[São Paulo]] and are making their way to a survivors' camp in [[Bethel, Vermont]]. Neville angrily argues that no such survivors' camp exists.

Neville once again attempts to administer a potential cure to the infected woman in his laboratory, but the next night, a group of Darkseekers, who had followed Anna and Neville back the night before, attacks the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute in the back of the lab. He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers at the cost of his own life, saving the cure. The next day, before dusk, Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors camp in [[Vermont]]. They are greeted by military officers and other human survivors before Anna is shown handing the cure to military personnel.

===Director's Cut ending===
&lt;!-- NOTE: The alternative ending is covered in its own section. Please do not replace the original ending here with the alternative ending. Thanks! --&gt;
During the lab attack, the alpha male makes a butterfly-shaped smear on the glass. Neville realizes that the alpha male is identifying the female which he was experimenting on by her butterfly tattoo and that it wants her back. Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. Neville and the alpha male stare each other down as the former apologizes to the latter. The alpha male accepts it and the Darkseekers leave. Shocked, Neville looks over the pictures of his numerous test subjects and the implications of his research methods begin to dawn on him. Neville, Anna, and Ethan then drive to the survivors' camp in Vermont with the antidote.

[[Mark Protosevich]] was hired to write the script after the studio was impressed with his [[spec script]] of ''[[The Cell]]''. Protosevich's first draft took place in 2000 in [[San Francisco]], and contained many similarities with the finished film, though the Darkseekers (called 'Hemocytes') were civilized to the point of the creatures in ''The Omega Man'' and Anna was a lone [[morphine]] [[Substance dependence|addict]], as well as the fact that a Hemocyte character named Christopher joined forces with Neville. Warner Bros. immediately put the film on the fast track, attaching [[Neal H. Moritz]] as [[film producer|producer]].&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt;

Actors [[Tom Cruise]], [[Michael Douglas]],&lt;ref name="duo"/&gt; and [[Mel Gibson]]&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; had been considered to star in the film,&lt;ref name="duo"&gt;{{cite news | author=Anita M.

In July, Scott and Schwarzenegger finalized negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Anita M.

The Scott/Logan version of ''I Am Legend'' was a mix of sci-fi and psychological thriller, without dialogue in the first hour and with a sombre ending.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; The creatures in Logan's version were similar to the Darkseekers of the finished film in their animalistic, barbaric nature. The studio, fearing its lack of commercial appeal and merchandising potential, began to worry about the liberties they had given Scott&amp;nbsp;– then on a negative streak of box office disappointments&amp;nbsp;– and urged the production team to reconsider the lack of action in the screenplay. After an "esoteric" draft by writer [[Neal Jimenez]], Warner Bros. reassigned Protosevich to the project, reluctantly working with Scott again.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt;

In December 1997, the project was called into question when the projected budget escalated to $108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big-budget film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR111729674.html?categoryid=3&amp;cs=1 | title='Legend' may not live on; Leighton lightens up | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=December 4, 1997 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott rewrote the script in an attempt to reduce the film's budget by $20 million,&lt;ref name="reins"&gt;{{cite news | author=Chris Petrikin | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117469681.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=Fox reins in 'Riders' | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=April 13, 1998 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in March 1998, the studio canceled the project due to continued budgetary concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-03-16/news/9803160197_1_legend-hollywood-reporter-million-budget | title=Schwarzenegger's 'Legend' is in peril | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=March 16, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quite possibly to the box office disappointment of Scott's last three films, ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'', ''[[White Squall (film)|White Squall]]'', and ''[[G.I.

[[Guillermo del Toro]] was originally approached to direct by Smith, but turned it down to direct ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117929062.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=Helmer takes on 'Legend' for WB | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=September 13, 2005 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence, whose film ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'' was produced by Goldsman, was fascinated by empty urban environments. He said, "Something's always really excited me about that... to have experienced that much loss, to be without people or any kind of social interaction for that long."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Goldsman took on the project as he admired the second ''I Am Legend'' film adaptation, ''The Omega Man''.&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Jensen | title=Will Smith: Making a 'Legend' | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=August 16, 2007 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20052055,00.html | accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rewrite was done to distance the project from the other [[zombie]] films inspired by the novel,&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; as well as from the recently released ''[[28 Days Later]],'' although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted [[London]] in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith's film ''[[Hancock (film)|Hancock]]'', which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor's films. This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks: production was given a green light, using Goldsman's script and the outline.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Elements from Protosevich's script were introduced, while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and [[solitary confinement]].&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith's improvisational skills and Lawrence's preference to keep various scenes silent.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The director had watched [[Jane Campion]]'s film ''[[The Piano]]'' with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son, and realized that silence could be very effective cinema.&lt;ref name=empire2/&gt;

[This] always felt like it had those possibilities to me."&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying [[Muhammad Ali]] in ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'' (2001). He said that "when you're on your own, it is kind of hard to find conflict." The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes.&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;{{cite news | author = Ian Nathan | title = I Am Legend | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = October 2007 | pages = 78–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare for his role, Smith visited the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former [[prisoner of war]].&lt;ref name=china/&gt; Smith compared Neville to [[Job (Bible)|Job]], who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the [[Book of Job]], ''I Am Legend'' studies the questions, "Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?"&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He also cited an influence in [[Tom Hanks]]' performance in ''[[Cast Away]]'' (2000).&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;

Akiva Goldsman decided to move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take advantage of locations that would more easily show emptiness.&lt;ref name="variation" /&gt; Goldsman explained, "L.A. looks empty at three o'clock in the afternoon, [but] New York is never empty . . . it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world."&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics,&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages.

Shooting the scene consumed $5 million of the film's reported $150 million budget, which was likely the most expensive shoot in the city to date. The scene, which had to meet requirements from 14 government agencies, involved 250 crew members and 1,000 extras, including 160 National Guard members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joseph |last=Steuer | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 | title=A 'Legend' in the making | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=April 24, 2007 | accessdate=April 26, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070428014812/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Addiego |first= Walter | url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/14/DDCFTTNAT.DTL | title=Review: I, human – Will Smith plays last man standing in 'I Am Legend' | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | date=December 14, 2007 | accessdate=December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also present were several [[Humvee]]s, three [[Stryker]]s, a {{convert|110|ft|m|adj=on}} [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutter]], a {{convert|41|ft|m|adj=on}} [[USCG Utility Boat|utility boat]], and two {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} response boat small craft, as well as other vehicles including taxis, police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news |first=Joseph |last=Steuer | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSN2335654320070424 | title=Government agencies cover filmmakers in red tape | publisher=Reuters | date=April 24, 2007 | accessdate=September 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming concluded on March 31, 2007.&lt;ref name="taking" /&gt; [[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) was used to depict the main spans of the Brooklyn Bridge and the [[Manhattan Bridge]] collapsing as missiles from passing military jets blew them up to quarantine Manhattan island.

Reshoots were conducted around November 2007. Lawrence noted, "We weren't seeing fully rendered shots until about a month ago. The movie starts to take on a whole other life. It's not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go, 'Huh, maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle, or tweak this a little bit.'

===Effects===
A week into filming, Francis felt the infected (referred to as "Darkseekers" or "hemocytes" in the script), who were being portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use CGI resulted in an increased budget and extended [[post-production]], although the end results were not always well received.&lt;ref name="timesreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rtreview" /&gt; The concept behind the infected was that their [[adrenal gland]]s were open all of the time and Lawrence explained, "They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can't get out of people in the middle of the night when they're barefoot. And their metabolisms are really spiked, so they're constantly [[hyperventilation|hyperventilating]], which you can't really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The actors remained on set to provide [[motion capture]].&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/nv_i_am_legend.html|title=Sony Pictures Imageworks - I Am Legend|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The film's producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human, but not the standard", so Mike Patton, lead singer of [[Faith No More]], was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Harris |first= Chris | title=Mike Patton Hits The Big Screen, Voicing 'I Am Legend' Baddies And Scoring 'Perfect' Indie Flick  | date=December 13, 2007 | url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1576342/story.jhtml | accessdate=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, CGI was used for the [[lion]]s and [[deer]] in the film, and to erase pedestrians in shots of New York. Workers visible in windows, spectators, and moving cars in the distance were all removed. In his vision of an empty New York, Lawrence cited [[John Ford]] as his influence: "We didn't want to make an apocalyptic movie where the landscape felt apocalyptic. A lot of the movie takes place on a beautiful day. There's something magical about the empty city as opposed to dark and scary that was the ideal that the cast and crew wanted."&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;

==Release==
''I Am Legend'' was originally slated for a November 21, 2007, release in the United States and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=16042 | title=Shooting Dates for ''I Am Legend'' | publisher=ComingSoon.net | date=August 16, 2006 | accessdate=April 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was delayed to December 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=11189 | title=I Am Legend | publisher=ComingSoon.net | accessdate=April 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film opened on December 26, 2007, in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.launchingfilms.com/releaseschedule/schedule.php?sort=date&amp;startmonth=12&amp;startyear=2007 | title=UK Film release schedule | publisher=Film Distributors' Association | accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], having been originally scheduled for January 4, 2008.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;

Premieres were held in Tokyo, New York, and London. At the London premiere in [[Leicester Square]], British comedian and actor [[Neg Dupree]] was arrested after pushing his way onto the red carpet and running around shouting "I am Negend!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.negdupree.com/urban-sports/uk/red-carpet-run/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117081800/http://www.negdupree.com/urban-sports/uk/red-carpet-run/ |archivedate=January 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} Neg Dupree Red Carpet Run&lt;/ref&gt; The stunt was part of his "Neg's Urban Sports" section of comedy game show ''[[Balls of Steel (TV series)|Balls of Steel]]''.

===Marketing===
The film's teaser was attached to the screenings of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''. And a tie-in comic from [[DC Comics]] and [[Vertigo Comics]] has been created, ''I Am Legend: Awakening''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.futuremovies.co.uk/filmmaking/one-man-his-dog-and-a-cg-apocalypse/nick-goundry |title=I Am Legend: Awakening|publisher=Future Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project draws upon collaboration from [[Bill Sienkiewicz]], screenwriter Mark Protosevich, and author [[Orson Scott Card]]. The son of the original book's author, Richard Christian Matheson, also collaborated on the project. The project will advance from the comic to an online format in which animated featurettes (created by the team from [[Broken Saints]]) will be shown on the official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Erik Amaya | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10992 | title=CCI: This Book is Legend | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=July 28, 2007 | accessdate=July 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Warner Bros. Pictures, in conjunction with the Electric Sheep Company, launched the online multiplayer game ''I Am Legend: Survival'' in the virtual world ''[[Second Life]]''.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film had an approval rating of 69% based on 211 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''I Am Legend'' overcomes questionable special effects and succeeds largely on the strength of Will Smith's mesmerizing performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_am_legend/ |title=I Am Legend |accessdate=April 11, 2010|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a rating to reviews, the film has an [[arithmetic mean|average]] score of 65 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="meta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/iamlegend |title=I Am Legend (2007): Reviews |accessdate=April 11, 2010|publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]] wrote that Will Smith gave a "graceful and effortless performance" and also noted the "third-act collapse".

''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' published an article on December 14, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= McCarthy |first= Erin
|publication-date= December 14, 2007 |title= I Am Legend's Junk Science: Hollywood Sci-Fi vs. Reality |periodical= [[Popular Mechanics]] |url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/a2399/4236920/ |accessdate= November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressing some of the scientific issues raised by the film:

# the rate of deterioration of urban structures, [[infrastructure]], and survival of [[fauna]] and [[flora]]
# the plausibility of a [[retrovirus]] spreading out of control as depicted in the film (The [[measles]] virus depicted in the film, however, is not a retrovirus, but is in fact a part of the ''[[Paramyxovirus]]'' family.)
# the mechanics of the Brooklyn Bridge's destruction

The magazine solicited reactions from [[Alan Weisman]], author of ''[[The World Without Us]]'', [[virology|virologist]] W. Ian Lipkin, [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], and Michel Bruneau, [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], comparing their predictions with the film's depictions. The article raised the most questions regarding the virus' mutation and the medical results, and pointed out that a [[suspension bridge]] like the Brooklyn Bridge would likely completely collapse rather than losing only its middle span. Neville's method of producing power using gasoline-powered generators seemed the most credible: "This part of the tale is possible, if not entirely likely," ''Popular Mechanics'' editor Roy Berendsohn says.

Philosopher [[Slavoj Zizek]] criticized the film politically as being the most [[Reactionary|regressive]] adaptation from the novel. He said that while the original novel had a progressive [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] message where Neville became a "legend" to the new creatures and is subsequently killed by them (much like vampires were legends to humans), the 2007 film finds a cure for the Darkseekers and it is delivered by a survivor through apparent [[miracle|divine intervention]]. According to Zizek, this misses the original message and "openly opt[s] for [[religious fundamentalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zizek |first=Slavoj  |authorlink=Slavoj Žižek |title=Living in the End Times |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MIz6BPT23Q4C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=I+Am+legend+zizek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JlR9UY_8NJKu4AObpIGgBw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20Am%20legend%20zizek&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 28, 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Verso Books |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Director Francis Lawrence said in 2008 that there would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role. The plot of the film would reveal what happened to Neville before the infected took over New York. [[D. B. Weiss]] was hired to write the script, while Lawrence was in negotiations to return as director on the contingent that the story was interesting enough. Smith later discussed the premise, which would have his character and a team going from New York City to [[Washington, D.C.]], as they made their last stand against those infected with the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Weintraub|title=Will Smith talks I AM LEGEND prequel|work=Collider.com|date=December 5, 2008|url=http://www.collider.com/entertainment/news/article.asp/aid/10055/tcid/1|accessdate=December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film would again explore the premise of what it is like to be alone. Lawrence stated, "... the tough thing is, how do we do that again and in a different way?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=11673&amp;count=0|title=Director Talks "I Am Legend" Prequel|work=WorstPreviews.com|date=January 16, 2009|accessdate=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, Francis Lawrence stated that the prequel was no longer in development saying, "I don't think that's ever going to happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2011/05/03/i-am-legend-prequel-will-smith-francis-lawrence|title=EXCLUSIVE: 'I Am Legend Prequel' Is Dead, Says Francis Lawrence|work=MoviesBlog.MTV.com|date=May 3, 2011|accessdate=August 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808124621/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2011/05/03/i-am-legend-prequel-will-smith-francis-lawrence|archivedate=August 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Warner Bros. announced that negotiations had been made to produce another installment, with the intention of having Will Smith reprise his role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Fleming Jr |first= Mike |title= Warner Bros Plans More 'I Am Legend' With Will Smith |work= Deadline |publisher= Penske Business Media, LLC |date= February 17, 2012 |url= http://www.deadline.com/2012/02/warner-bros-plans-more-i-am-legend/ |accessdate= February 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the studio attained a script entitled ''A Garden at the End of the World'', described as a post-apocalyptic variation of ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''. Studio executives found so many similarities to ''I Am Legend'' in the screenplay, they had the writer Gary Graham rewrite it so it could serve as the next film. Serving as a reboot of the story, the studio hopes to create a franchise of films. [[Will Smith]], who is known for his reluctance to appear in sequels,&lt;ref name="ial" /&gt; has not commented on whether he will appear or not.&lt;ref name="ial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/i-am-legend-reboot-sold-by-iphone-salesman-warner-bros-will-smith-844507/|title=Warner Bros Connects With iPhone Salesman/Scribe's Pitch For 'I Am Legend' Reboot|date=October 2, 2014|work=Deadline|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I Hate This (a play without the baby)''''' is a solo performance by [[David Hansen (playwright)|David Hansen]] detailing his experiences as the father of a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] child.

==Production==
First produced at [[Cleveland Public Theater|Cleveland Public Theatre]] in 2003, this award winning performance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestof.clevescene.com/bestof/award.php?award=21037&amp;year=2003 |title=Best Actor 2003 |publisher=Cleveland Scene |accessdate=2007-10-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922144546/http://bestof.clevescene.com/bestof/award.php?award=21037&amp;year=2003 |archivedate=2007-09-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been presented at the [[Minnesota Fringe Festival]] and the [[New York International Fringe Festival|New York Fringe Festival]], as well as for numerous bereavement organisations in the United States and in Great Britain, and as a training event at hospitals for midwives, nurses and doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-sands.org/fileadmin/content/Media/David_Hansen_final.doc|title=Critically acclaimed play, 'I HATE THIS (a play without the baby)’, to be performed across the UK for the first time this summer|publisher=SANDS UK|accessdate = 2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production was revived by the playwright at Cleveland Public Theater in April, 2011.&lt;ref name="cpt11"&gt;[http://cptonline.org/theater-show.php?id=142 Cleveland Public Theatre website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 the play was first performed in its entirety by a different actor than David Hansen. Freerange Theatre Company produced ''I Hate This'' at [[The Lowry|The Lowry Studio Theatre]] in [[Manchester]], England. The role of David was played by John Dayton, directed by Hugo Chandor. In November 2015 ''I Hate This'' was produced at [[Hartwick College]] in [[Oneonta, New York]] in a fully realized production directed, designed and performed by Brian Chandler Cook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.com/news/local_news/hartwick-senior-to-perform-one-man-show/article_fea5aba1-49cf-5576-9cbe-894bd9847ca6.html|title=Hartwick senior to perform one-man show|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
At their thirty-week [[prenatal]] appointment, the playwright and his wife discover their first child has died due to [[preeclampsia]].  The events of the play cover the thirty-six hours between that revelation and the birth of their son, and also events during the year that leads up to this child's first birthday, all from the point of view of the father.  In twenty-seven short scenes, the narrator performs a dozen characters including members of his family, friends, and a number of health care professionals and counselors.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By elucidating such mundane moments as his futile attempts to be removed from a baby-food company mailing list, Hansen gives us a glimpse into day-to-day life after a baby dies."

'''''Jack Upland''''' or '''''Jack up Lande''''' (c. 1389–96?) is a polemical, probably [[Lollard]], literary work which can be seen as a "sequel" to ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', with [[Antichrist]] attacking Christians through corrupt confession. Jack asks a "flattering friar" (''cf.'' ''Piers Plowman''{{'}}s "Friar Flatterer") nearly seventy questions attacking the [[mendicant order]]s and exposing their distance from scriptural truth.

Two extant works respond to Jack's questions: ''Responsiones ad Questiones LXV'' (before 1396) and ''Friar Daw's Reply'' (Digby 41, c. 1420). The latter text blasts [[John Wycliffe]] as one of history's major [[heresy|heretics]]. Responding to Friar Daw, an unknown author wrote ''Upland's Rejoinder'', which survives in Digby 41, in the margins surrounding ''Friar Daw's Reply''. ''Upland's Rejoinder'' intensifies the level of invective: Daw is said to recruit the young sons of true-living plowmen to become (paradoxically) "worldly beggars," [[apostacy|apostates]] against true rule, and [[sodomy|sodomites]].

''Jack Upland'' was printed by itself in an [[octavo]] edition c. 1536–40 by [[John Gough (printer)|John Gough]] (STC 5098). [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Acts and Monuments]]'' (1563, 1570) reprinted ''Jack Upland'' and attributed it to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. [[Thomas Speght]]'s 1602 edition of Chaucer's ''Works'' (STC 5080) included ''Jack Upland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=26098|first=David|last=Matthews|title=Speght, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1959, Lehrer began his career in journalism at ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' in Texas.  Later, he worked as a Reporter for the ''[[Dallas Times-Herald]]'', where he covered the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in 1963. There, he was a Political Columnist for several years, and in 1968 he became the City Editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jim-Lehrer 
|title=Jim Lehrer - American Journalist and Author |date=30 August 2011 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica 
|website=Britannica.com |accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehrer began his television career at [[KERA-TV]] in Dallas, Texas, as the Executive Director of Public Affairs, an On-air Host, and Editor of a nightly news program. He moved to [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in Washington, D.C., to become the Public Affairs Coordinator, a member of Journalism Advisory Board, and a Fellow at the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] (CPB).  He worked as a Correspondent for the National Public Affairs Center for Television (NPACT) where he met [[Robert MacNeil]]. In 1973, they covered the [[Senate Watergate hearings]] and the revelation of the [[Watergate scandal#Senate Watergate hearings revelation of the Watergate Tapes|Watergate Tapes]] broadcast, live on PBS. Lehrer covered the [[House Judiciary Committee]]'s [[Watergate scandal#Final investigations and resignation|impeachment inquiry of President Richard Nixon]].

In October 1975, Lehrer became the Washington Correspondent for the "[[Robert MacNeil]] Report" on Thirteen/[[WNET]] New York. Two months later on December 1, 1975, he was promoted to co-anchor, and the program was accordingly renamed "The MacNeil/Lehrer Report". In September 1983, Lehrer and MacNeil relaunched their show as ''The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour'' which, after MacNeil's departure in 1995, was renamed ''The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'', and in 2009 became the ''PBS NewsHour''.&lt;ref name=PBSbio&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us: Jim Lehrer, Executive Editor |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/spc/news/jimlehrer/ |publisher=The PBS NewsHour |year=2012 |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehrer underwent a heart valve surgery in April 2008, and, while he recuperated, [[Ray Suarez]] anchored in his stead until his return on June 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=The Associated Press | title=''NewsHour'' Anchor Jim Lehrer Has Heart Surgery | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/04/25/arts/TV-Lehrer-Surgery.php | work=The International Herald Tribune | date=25 April 2008 | accessdate=26 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2011, Lehrer stepped down as anchor of the ''PBS NewsHour''; however, he continued to moderate the Friday news analysis segments, and continued to be involved with the show's production company, MacNeil/Lehrer Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Farhi |title=Jim Lehrer to step down from daily broadcast at 'NewsHour' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/jim-lehrer-to-step-down-from-daily-broadcast-at-pbs-newshour/2011/05/12/AFS5VwyG_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=May 12, 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehrer hosted the [[First U.S. presidential debate of 2012|first U.S. Presidential Debate]] for the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 U.S. Presidential general election]].

Coming out of semi-retirement to moderate his 12th Presidential Debate, while he was criticized on [[social media]] and in the press for his lack of control and open-ended questions, he was praised for letting the candidates have some control in the debate on their own terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Bauder | title = Tough Reviews for Jim Lehrer as Debate Moderator |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Tough-reviews-for-Jim-Lehrer-as-debate-moderator-3917905.php | date = 4 October 2012 | publisher = ''Hearst Communications Inc.'' | work = San Francisco Chronicle, California, USA | accessdate = 4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/jim-lehrers-debate-performance-criticized-defended-and-analyzed/2012/10/04/62d09810-0e19-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_story.html |title=Jim Lehrer's Debate Performance Criticized, Defended, and Analyzed |publisher=''The Washington Post, USA'' |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Journals of Ayn Rand''''' is a book derived from the private journals of novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]]. Edited by David Harriman with the approval of Rand's estate, it was published in 1997, 15 years after her death. Some reviewers considered it an interesting source of information for readers with an interest in Rand, but several scholars criticized Harriman's editing as being too heavy-handed and insufficiently acknowledged in the published text.

==Background==
When Rand died in 1982, her private papers were left to her student and heir [[Leonard Peikoff]]. Starting in 1983, Peikoff began authorizing the publication of excerpts from her journals and other unpublished writings. From 1983 to 1994, several such excerpts appeared in ''[[The Objectivist Forum]]''&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The excerpts published in ''The Objectivist Forum'' were:&lt;br /&gt;"Philosophic Journal" (August 1983)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes for Atlas Shrugged" (December 1983)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes for Atlas Shrugged" (April 1984)&lt;br /&gt;"Philosophic Notes" (August 1984)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes for The Fountainhead" (December 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Intellectual Activist]]''.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The excerpts published in ''The Intellectual Activist'' were:&lt;br /&gt;"From Ayn Rand's Notes for Atlas Shrugged" (January 1992)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes on Scene in Roark's Apartment" (January 1993)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes on the Thomas Committee" (November 1993)&lt;br /&gt;"'Memory-Storing' Epistemology" (January 1994)&lt;br /&gt;"Ayn Rand's Journals: Selections from The Moral Basis of Individualism" (November 1995)&lt;br /&gt;"From Ayn Rand's Journals: Notes on The Fountainhead" (January and March 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; David Harriman, a physicist and a speaker for the [[Ayn Rand Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_DavidHarriman |title=David Harriman |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=September 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617063729/http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_DavidHarriman |archivedate=June 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited Rand's journals for publication in book form. The hardcover edition of the fully edited ''Journals of Ayn Rand'' was published by [[E. P. Dutton|Dutton]] in 1997. A paperback edition was published by [[Plume (publishing)|Plume]] in 1999.

==Contents==
In a foreword for the book, Peikoff describes Rand's journals, with a few exceptions, as being "written for herself, for her own clarity" and not intended for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preface by Harriman describes the material as being about three-quarters of Rand's "''working'' journals", collected from "numerous boxes of papers she left behind at her death". He describes his editing as consisting of "selection, organization, line editing, and insertion of explanatory comments."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that "not a great deal of line editing was required", and that his editorial insertions and "omissions of passages" are marked in the published text.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|pages=xvi–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the book consists of Rand's edited journals, divided into five major sections. The first section, titled "Early Projects" includes scenarios for silent movies that Rand developed when she first moved to Hollywood in the 1920s. There are also notes and outlines for her first published novel, ''[[We the Living]]'', and for another early novel that was never completed. Entries in an early "philosophic journal" from April and May 1934, are described by Rand as "the vague beginnings of an amateur philosopher."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second section, titled "''The Fountainhead''", consists of material related to her [[The Fountainhead|novel of that name]]. She took extensive notes from her research on architecture, and created profiles for each character, often based on information about real people. There are several outlines of the plot and notes she made while the novel was being written.

The third section, titled "Transition Between Novels", includes draft material for three unfinished projects. The first was a non-fiction book to be called ''The Moral Basis of Individualism''. The second was a movie about the development of the [[atomic bomb]], tentatively titled ''Top Secret''. The third was an essay called "To All Innocent Fifth Columnists", to be circulated by a proposed organization of conservative intellectuals that never formed. This section also reprints a transcript of Rand's 1949 testimony before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], along with her own notes about the committee's efforts to investigate [[Communism]].

The fourth section, "''Atlas Shrugged''", has her notes and outlines for her [[Atlas Shrugged|final novel]]. In addition to planning for characters and plot points, her notes include research on the railroad and steel industries, and thoughts on various philosophical issues to be addressed in the novel.

The fifth and final section, "Final Years", covers the years 1955 to 1977. It includes notes about "psycho-epistemology" and ideas for two possible books. One was a non-fiction book about Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. The other was a novel to be titled ''To Lorne Dieterling''.

==Reception==
Objectivist philosopher [[David Kelley]] described the material in Rand's journals as "contain[ing] a number of passages that explain key points in her philosophy more fully and clearly than anything she published." Kelley called the book "a treasure" and said Harriman's editing was "skillful", although he criticized Harriman for not providing more complete notes on cases where Rand had later changed her positions from those documented in the journal entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] magazine [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'']], [[Walter Olson]] said the book was "a less-than-ideal place to start for those not already closely familiar with the Russian-born author's work."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|1998|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he said it did "furnish a deep popcorn bowl of sheer fan value" for those interested in Rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|1998|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brief review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it a "valuable sourcebook" for those interested in Rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hardcovers in Brief |work=[[The Washington Post]] {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}} |date=November 9, 1997 |accessdate=July 9, 2014 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-759398.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', conservative writer [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] offered his "harsh assessment" that the insights Rand had about the dangers of collectivism were "made absurd only by the philosophy she piled on top of it." For aspiring writers, he said, "The journals' central lesson is that one should never underestimate the importance of pomposity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooks|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review produced responses in the form of a short article in ''Liberty'' calling it an "uninformed hatchet job"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raico|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a letter from philosopher [[Allan Gotthelf]] calling it "the usual sneers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gotthelf|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a bibliography of Rand's works, [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] said the book "illustrates Rand’s dedication to her craft and her meticulous preparation for writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Brooks and Gladstein indicated that the term 'journals' was misleading because the material focuses on Rand's works and ideas, instead of more personal thoughts.

Describing Rand as a rigorous but misanthropic thinker, ''[[Booklist]]'' said her journals would "be of vital interest to many".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seaman|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said it was of interest only for those who were "lovers and loathers" of Rand, describing the book as being "As intriguing yet sometimes numbing as her fiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Forecasts: Nonfiction: ''The Journals of Ayn Rand'' |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=August 4, 1997 |volume=244 |issue=32 |page=56 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-94370-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]]'' recommended the book for academic libraries, saying it would be welcomed by "Rand aficionados".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Overmyer|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of the book were also published in ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=''Journals of Ayn Rand'' |work=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=July 15, 1997 |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-harriman/journals-of-ayn-rand/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kamiya|1998|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns about editing===
In a review of the book in [[Liberty (1987)|''Liberty'']] magazine, [[Stephen D. Cox|Stephen Cox]] questioned the editorial choices made by Harriman. He said that Harriman tried "to steer a middle course" between casual and scholarly readers of Rand's work, but he wondered "where should the line be drawn?" He cited examples given by Harriman as the types of passages omitted, saying some of them were "precisely the kind of note that scholars want to see". Cox also said that Harriman's editing for grammar and "wordiness" was insufficiently explained, which acted "to undermine the objective authority of the text."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cox|1998|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in the next issue of ''Liberty'', Rand scholar [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]] raised additional concerns about how Harriman had edited the material. Sciabarra compared a passage that had been published previously in ''The Intellectual Activist'' with the corresponding passage in the book. He found differences between the two, including the omission of a reference to [[Albert Jay Nock]] in the book version. He quoted Harriman's preface about how changes from the original were supposed to be noted in the text, and said, "When such editorial changes are not made explicit, when not even ellipsis points are provided to indicate missing text, doubt is cast unnecessarily on the volume's authenticity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Sciabarra's essay, Gladstein gave the book as an example of publishing efforts by Rand's estate that "have not always exhibited a confidence-inspiring level of academic rigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[The Ayn Rand Cult]]'', journalist Jeff Walker suggested the published journals might be "completely unreliable and ... may have been thoroughly twisted in the interests of the present-day cult".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1999|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While writing a [[Goddess of the Market|biography of Rand]], historian Jennifer Burns worked with the original journals in the Ayn Rand Archives, and compared the material there with published versions. She said Rand's journals had been edited in ways that are "significant and problematic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns said Harriman's changes "significantly alter Rand's meaning" in a number of cases, transforming the tentative and evolving ideas in Rand's notes into "a slick manufactured world in which all her ideas are definite, well formulated, and clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an entry on her blog describing her experiences at the archives, Burns said the staff of the archives "heartily disapproved" of how the book was edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=In the Rand Archives, Part 2: The edited letters and diaries |url=http://www.jenniferburns.org/blog/65-in-the-rand-archives-part-2-the-edited-letters-and-diaries |first=Jennifer |last=Burns |date=September 13, 2009 |accessdate=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kingston''' is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and largest city of [[Jamaica]], located on the southeastern coast of the island. It faces a natural [[harbor|harbour]] protected by the [[Palisadoes]], a long [[spit (landform)|sand spit]] which connects the town of [[Port Royal]] and the [[Norman Manley International Airport]] to the rest of the island. In the [[Americas]], Kingston is the largest predominantly English-speaking city south of the United States.

The local government bodies of the parishes of Kingston and [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|St. Andrew]] were amalgamated by the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation Act of 1923, to form the '''Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation''' ('''KSAC'''). Greater Kingston, or the "Corporate Area" refers to those areas under the KSAC; however, it does not solely refer to [[Kingston Parish, Jamaica|Kingston Parish]], which only consists of the old downtown and Port Royal. Kingston Parish had a population of 96,052, and St. Andrew Parish had a population of 555,828 in 2001.&lt;ref name="kingston"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartyoung.com/cities/kingston/brief_history.htm |title=Brief history of Kingston, Jamaica |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190604/http://www.smartyoung.com/cities/kingston/brief_history.htm |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kingston is only bordered by Saint Andrew to the east, west and north. The geographical border for the parish of Kingston encompasses the following communities, [[Tivoli Gardens (Kingston, Jamaica)|Tivoli Gardens]], [[Denham Town]], [[Rae Town]], [[Kingston Gardens]], [[National Heroes Park]], Bournemouth Gardens, [[Norman Gardens (Kingston, Jamaica)|Norman Gardens]], [[Rennock Lodge]], Springfield  and [[Port Royal]], along with portions of [[Rollington Town]], [[Franklyn Town]] and [[Allman Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electoral Commission of Jamaica|url=http://www.eoj.com.jm/parish-4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Texas, Perry-Castañeda Library Map Collection|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/jamaica.html/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city proper is bounded by Six Miles to the west, Stony Hill to the north, Papine to the northeast and Harbour View to the east, communities in urban and suburban Saint Andrew. Communities in rural St. Andrew such as Gordon Town, Mavis Bank, Lawrence Tavern, Mt. Airy and Bull Bay would not be described as being in Kingston city.

Two parts make up the central area of Kingston: the historic Downtown, and New Kingston. Both are served by [[Norman Manley International Airport]] and also by the smaller and primarily domestic [[Tinson Pen Aerodrome]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Kingston, Jamaica}}
[[File:1882 Kingston Fire.png|thumb|Scenes in Kingston after the 1882 fire.]]
[[File:Map Kingston 1897.jpg|thumb|Map of Kingston 1897]]

Kingston was founded in July 1692{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} as a place for survivors of the [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|1692 earthquake]] that destroyed [[Port Royal]]. Before the [[earthquake]], Kingston’s functions were purely agricultural. The earthquake survivors set up a camp on the sea front. Approximately two thousand people died due to mosquito-borne diseases. Initially the people lived in a tented camp on Colonel Barry's ''Hog Crawle''. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703. Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. The new grid system of the town was designed to facilitate commerce, particularly the system of main thoroughfares {{convert|66|ft}} across which allowed transportation between the port and plantations farther inland.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=Emily|title=Kingston, Jamaica – a city born of 'wickedness' and disaster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/24/story-cities-9-kingston-jamaica-richest-wickedest-city-world|accessdate=24 March 2016|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1716 it had become the largest town and the centre of trade for [[Jamaica]].
The government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in [[Port Royal]], and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of [[Liguanea]].

The first free school, Wolmers's, was founded in 1729&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolmers.net/boys/history.html|title=Wolmers's Boys School|website=wolmers.net|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a theatre, first on Harbour Street and then moved in 1774 to North Parade. Both are still in existence. In 1755 the [[List of Governors of Jamaica|governor]], [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]], had decided to transfer the government offices from [[Spanish Town]] to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston.

By the end of the 18th century, the city contained more than 3,000 brick buildings. The harbour fostered trade, and played part in several naval wars of the 18th century. Kingston took over the functions of Spanish Town (the capital at the time). These functions included agriculture, commercial, processing and a main transport hub to and from Kingston and other sections of the island.

The government passed an act to transfer the government offices to Kingston from Spanish Town, which occurred in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Kingston-Jamaica&lt;/ref&gt; It kept this status when the island was granted independence in 1962.

[[File:Kingston (1907).jpg|thumb|Bird's eye view of Kingston after the 1907 earthquake]]

In 1907, 800 people died in another earthquake known as the [[1907 Kingston earthquake]], destroying nearly all the historical buildings south of Parade in the city. That was when a restriction of no more than {{convert|60|ft|m}} was instituted on buildings in the city centre. These three-story-high buildings were built with reinforced concrete. Construction on King Street in the city was the first area to breach this building code.

During the 1930s, island-wide riots led to the development of [[trade union]]s and political parties to represent workers.

The city became home to the [[Mona, Jamaica|Mona]] campus of the [[University of the West Indies]] founded in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Kingston-Jamaica&lt;/ref&gt; with 24 medical students.

Not until the 1960s did major change occur in the development of Kingston’s city centre. The international attention of [[reggae]] music at that time coincided with the expansion and development of {{convert|95|acre|ha}} of the Kingston city centre waterfront area. These developments led to an influx of shops and offices, and the development of a new financial centre: New Kingston, which replaced the Knutsford Racetrack. Multi-story buildings and boulevards were placed within that section.

In 1966 Kingston was the host city to the [[1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]].

The western section of the city was not the focus of development, and that area proved to be politically tense. The 1970s saw deteriorating economic conditions that led to recurrent violence and a decline in tourism which later affected the island.

[[File:Downtown Kingston waterfront.jpg|thumb|right|View of the central Kingston waterfront showing the [[Bank of Nova Scotia]] and the [[Bank of Jamaica]]]]

In the 1980 general elections, the [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] [[People's National Party]] (PNP) government was voted out, and subsequent governments have been more market-oriented. Within a global urban era, the 1990s saw that Kingston has made efforts to modernise and develop its city structure and functions. Various organisations such as the Kingston Restoration Company, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), the Port Authority of Jamaica and the [[Port Royal]] Development Company, among others sought to develop the urban structure of the city.

==Demographics==
The majority of the population of Kingston is of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African descent]]. Large minority ethnic groups include [[Indo-Jamaican|East Indians]] and Chinese, who came to the country as [[indentured servants]] in the late 19th century. The Chinese occupy important roles in Jamaica's economy especially in the retail markets in Downtown Kingston and the wider metropolitan area. There is also a minority of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], mostly descending from immigrants from Germany and Great Britain. [[Syrians]] and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] form one of the most influential ethnic groups in not only Kingston, but the entire island. Though a minority ethnic group, the [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] were able to give Jamaica one of its prime ministers, [[Edward Philip George Seaga]]. There is a strong undercurrent of bias based on skin color as darker skinned Jamaicans are usually at the very bottom of the socio-economic ladder; a phenomenon evidenced by the disproportionate representation of foreigners and mixed-race individuals in lucrative private sector and government positions. Multi-racial Jamaicans continue to form the second largest racial group, and there is also a small Jewish population in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucija.org/visit.htm|title=Synagogue and Heritage Centre|accessdate=30 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728141912/http://www.ucija.org/visit.htm |archivedate=28 July 2011 }}

==Religion==

There is a wide variety of [[Christianity|Christian]] churches in the city. Most are [[Protestantism|Protestant]], a legacy of British colonisation of the island. The chief denominations are [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]], [[Baptist]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Methodist]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]]. 

There is a strong [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] community, with the [[Holy Trinity Cathedral (Kingston)|Holy Trinity Cathedral]] which is the seat of metropolitan archbishop and was consecrated in 1911, as well a few Catholic schools and institutions such as the [[Immaculate Conception High School (Jamaica)|Immaculate Conception High School]], St Francis Primary and Infant School, [[Holy Childhood High|Holy Childhood High School]] which was founded and is owned by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of our Lady of Perpetual Help (FMS) in Jamaica.

Afro-Christian [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religions such as the [[Rastafari movement]] also have a significant following.

The [[Shaare Shalom Synagogue]] serves Kingston's [[Judaism|Jewish]] population. The city also has communities of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Muslims]]. The Islamic Council of Jamaica and the Islamic Education and Dawah Centre are both located in Kingston. There are three units of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.lds.org/|title=LDS Meetinghouse Location website, accessed 11 April 2010|website=lds.org|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Air jamaica building from the west.jpg|thumb|left|[[Air Jamaica]] headquarters]]
Kingston plays a central role in Jamaica's economy. The vast majority of economic activity takes place within Kingston, and as most government ministries are located in the city, it is a key force in legislation in regards to Jamaica's finances.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Kingston, Jamaica.JPG|thumb|Photo of Kingston taken from the [[International Space Station]]]]

Kingston is surrounded by the [[Blue Mountains (Jamaica)|Blue Mountains]], Red Hills, Long Mountain and the [[Kingston Harbour]]. The city is on the [[Liguanea]] plain, an alluvial plain alongside the Hope River. Kingston experiences frequent earthquakes, including the 1907 earthquake.

Kingston has a tropical climate, specifically a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet-and-dry climate]], that borders on a hot-[[semi arid]] climate. (''Bsh''). characterised by a wet season from May to November, which coincides with the hurricane season, and a dry season from December to April. During the dry season, there is not much rainfall, however, cold and stationary fronts occur at this time, and often bring heavy showers, especially in March. Kingston is in the [[rain shadow]] of the Blue Mountains; therefore, little to none of the moisture carried by the Northeast [[Trade Winds]] falls over Kingston, causing Kingston to be very dry in comparison to [[Portland Parish, Jamaica|Portland]] and [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|Saint Mary]] on the windward side of the Blue Mountains. Kingston is on a coastal location, hence it comes under the influence of the sea, though dense urban development can negate this effect. In the 21st century, Kingston has experienced temperatures as high as {{convert|38.8|°C|0}} and as low as {{convert|13.4|°C|0}}. Between 1895 and 1990, the total average rainfall was recorded at {{convert|813|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the highest monthly average rainfall recorded in October at {{convert|177|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the lowest monthly average rainfall recorded in March at {{convert|18|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=climate /&gt; Fog, hail, thunder and tornadoes are all extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voodooskies.com/weather/jamaica/kingston/monthly/climate|title=Voodoo Skies - Kingston Monthly Climate weather history|first=|last=VoodooSkies.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Housing ==
In 1848 the Jamaican government expanded Kingston by constructing new homes in the west, north and east of the city. This housing became highly segregated in terms of race and class and by 1860 the majority of white elites lived on the outskirts of the city.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mappingkingston.wordpress.com/2012/08/18/urban-growth-and-town-expansion/|title=Urban Growth and Town Expansion|date=18 August 2012|website=Kingston, Jamaica|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Kingston’s population grew, existing settlements became so densely occupied that marshes in the southwest were filled in to allow the development of new housing. By 1935, continued population growth and poverty resulted in the emergence of slums in the east and west of the city. Later these areas were demolished by the government and residents were rehoused in [[Denham Town]]. This development accommodated 3,000 people, leaving more than one sixth of displaced resident homeless. Consequently, overcrowding persisted throughout the city and cramped living condition resulted in public health issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Suburbanization]] also became significant and by the 1960s this residential area spread to the foothills of the Blue Mountains. Subsequently, the lack of space and continued consumerism meant this area then expanded to the east of the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Colin|last2=Howard|first2=David|date=1 June 2006|title=Contradictory socio-economic consequences of structural adjustment in Kingston, Jamaica|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4959.2006.00197.x/abstract|journal=Geographical Journal|language=en|volume=172|issue=2|pages=106–129|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4959.2006.00197.x|issn=1475-4959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kingston, 20% of the population now live in squatter settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalhousingindicators.org/en/content/kingston-jamaica|title=Kingston, Jamaica {{!}} Global Housing Policy Indicators|website=globalhousingindicators.org|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrastingly, Kingston is also home to the ‘Goldilocks zone’, a suburb that holds some of the most expensive houses in all of Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atlantablackstar.com/2014/09/29/9-richest-neighborhoods-in-jamaica/2/|title=9 of the Richest Neighborhoods in Jamaica - Page 2 of 5|last=Leo|date=29 September 2014|website=Atlanta Black Star|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks==

The city of Kingston is home to a number of urban parks which are frequently transformed to accommodate various events and festivities on the Jamaican calendar. The most popular parks include: Emancipation Park, Hope Gardens, Devon House, National Heroes' Park, [[St. William Grant|St William Grant Park]] and Mandela Park.

===Emancipation Park===
{{Main|Emancipation Park (Kingston, Jamaica)}}
[[File:Emancipation Park-Statues-1.jpg|thumb|Emancipation Park, Kingston, Jamaica 2004]]
The Liguanea Club, a recreational and social club for the upper class in society, located on Knutsford Boulevard, owned over {{convert|35|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land including the former Liguanea Park now the site of Emancipation Park. The club gave the land measuring seven acres as a gift to the Jamaican Government.

Several government members argued that the land should be converted into a business district, while others felt a multi-functional entertainment complex should be built on the site. The large financial input needed for either venture, was not forthcoming. In 2002 Cabinet granted approval for the transfer of the land to the National Housing Trust on the condition that a park was built and maintained at that location. The land was transferred for one Jamaican dollar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emancipationpark.org.jm/about-us/history-of-emancipation-park.php] Official website of Emancipation Park&lt;/ref&gt;

The park is well known for the 11&amp;nbsp;ft. (approximately 3m) high bronze sculpture done by Jamaican artist Laura Facey, situated at the park's main entrance. This prominent sculpture comprises two naked black male and female statues gazing to the skies – symbolic of their triumphant rise from the horrors of slavery. The statue was unveiled in July 2003, in time for the park's first anniversary&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emancipationpark.org.jm/about-us/facey-sings.php] Official website of Emancipation Park&lt;/ref&gt; which caused an out cry from the Jamaican populace who believed that the blatant nudity and generous bodily proportions of the figures were very inappropriate to depict the freedom of black people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicatravelandculture.com/destinations/kingston/redemption-song-statue.htm] Jamaica Travel and Culture.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hope Gardens===
The Royal Botanical Gardens at Hope, popularly called Hope Gardens serves as a national attraction. The Hope Gardens is a part of the {{convert|2000|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land making it the largest botanical garden in the English-speaking Caribbean. The land situated by the foothills of the Blue Mountains was originally owned by Major Richard Hope from whom it got its name. Two hundred acres of this land was obtained by the Government of Jamaica in 1880 and was originally established as a plant introduction and crop-testing facility for plants such as pineapple, cocoa, coffee and tobacco. The formal Botanical Gardens were laid out on approximately {{convert|60|acres|0|abbr=on}} of this land with the assistance of personnel from the Kew Gardens in England.

In the 1950s, the Queen, after visiting the island and being pleased with the state of the gardens, gave permission for it to be called the Royal Botanical Gardens, Hope. The Gardens have many exotic species along with some endemic trees of Jamaica. Over the years, the ravages of hurricanes and other disasters have resulted in the loss of a significant number of species. However, there are still some prominent trees and popular sites to be viewed in the Gardens. At Hope Gardens, visitors can view a number of other features including the Coconut Museum, the Sunken Gardens, the Orchid House, the Lily Pond, the Maze and Palm Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitjamaica.com/activities/royal-botanical-gardens.aspx |title=Hope Royal Botanical Gardens, Kingston |publisher=Visitjamaica.com |date= |accessdate=13 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718133245/http://www.visitjamaica.com/activities/royal-botanical-gardens.aspx |archivedate=18 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jamaicachm.org.jm/PDF/February2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hope Gardens has an adjoining zoo referred to as Hope Gardens Zoo. The gardens and zoo are currently undergoing redevelopment to improve the physical landscape and the animal inventory as a part of Bring Back The Hope campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.jamaicaobserver.com/business/Robert-Lalor-appointed-CEO-of-Nature-Preservation-Foundation_8732757 |title=Robert Lalor appointed CEO of Nature Preservation Foundation - Business - JamaicaObserver.com |publisher=M.jamaicaobserver.com |date=1 May 2011 |accessdate=13 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330052057/http://m.jamaicaobserver.com/business/Robert-Lalor-appointed-CEO-of-Nature-Preservation-Foundation_8732757 |archivedate=30 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==

===Road===
The [[St. William Grant|St William Grant Park]] (Parade) in the heart of downtown Kingston is the starting point for three of [[A2 road (Jamaica)|Jamaica's four A roads]], namely the A1 (Kingston to [[Lucea, Jamaica|Lucea]]), the A3 (Kingston to [[Saint Ann's Bay]]) and the A4 (Kingston to [[Annotto Bay]]), while the city itself is provided with a dense network of trunk, main, secondary and minor roads. It also consists of the [[Highway 2000, Jamaica]] which runs through [[Portmore, Jamaica|Portmore]], [[Ocho Rios]] and [[Mandeville, Jamaica|Mandeville]]. A new section of [[Highway 2000, Jamaica]] (called "T3") was recently opened to the public. It has greatly reduced the travel time between Kingston and Montego Bay from 4 hours to a mere 2 1/2 hours.

Kingston is served well by a modern bus system, mini buses and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  [http://wikimapia.org/#lat=17.9710231&amp;lon=-76.7928994&amp;z=18&amp;l=0&amp;m=b&amp;v=8 Parade], [[Cross Roads, Jamaica|Cross Roads]], [[Half Way Tree]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="autogenerated66"&gt;[http://www.mtw.gov.jm/general_information/reports/TransportStatisticsReport2003_2004.pdf Table 3.12 (PDF page 66) ff.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315174612/http://www.mtw.gov.jm/general_information/reports/TransportStatisticsReport2003_2004.pdf |date=15 March 2013 }}, Annual Transport Statistics Report: Jamaica in Figures 2003-2004, Jamaica Ministry of Transport and Works.&lt;/ref&gt;

Private car ownership levels are high,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and like many major urban conurbations Kingston suffers from frequent traffic jams and pollution.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Buses===
In June 1898, the existing mule car service was phased out and a transition to electric trams, initially operated by the West India Electric Company and later by the Jamaica Public Service Company, was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Jamaica Public Service Company Limited |url=http://www.myjpsco.com/about_us/our_history.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507143804/http://www.myjpsco.com/about_us/our_history.php |archivedate=7 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This transition to the electric tram was completed on 31 March 1899. This service continued to operate, but the inflexibility of a tram service could not keep pace with a growing city, and the tram service ceased to operate on 7 August 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Last Trams, The Daily Gleaner, 7 August 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1948 and 1953 a motor bus service was operated by a company called Jamaica Utilities. The government revoked its franchise in 1953. 

From 1953 to 1983 the [[Jamaica Omnibus Service]] operated a service, which at its peak consisted of over 600 buses and served an area spanning Spanish Town, Border, Mt. James, Bull Bay and Port Royal. It was wound up by the government in 1983 after being nationalised in 1974.

Kingston is served well by a modern bus system, the [[Jamaica Urban Transit Company]] (JUTC), mini buses, and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  [http://wikimapia.org/#lat=17.9710231&amp;lon=-76.7928994&amp;z=18&amp;l=0&amp;m=b&amp;v=8 Parade], [[Cross Roads, Jamaica|Cross Roads]], [[Half Way Tree]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="autogenerated66"/&gt;

===Rail===
The now disused [[Kingston railway station, Jamaica|Kingston railway station]] served the [[Railways of Jamaica: Kingston to Montego Bay|Kingston to Montego Bay]] main line with branches from [[Railways of Jamaica: Spanish Town to Ewarton|Spanish Town to Ewarton]], [[Railways of Jamaica: Bog Walk to Port Antonio|Bog Walk to Port Antonio]], [[Railways of Jamaica: Linstead to New Works|Linstead to New Works]] and [[Railways of Jamaica: May Pen to Frankfield|May pen to Frankfield]].

The railway station opened in 1845 and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica's railways abruptly ceased.&lt;ref name="JTH18"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3884/is_200303/ai_n9209497/pg_18 The rise and fall of railways in Jamaica, 1845-1975 - Pg18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425135205/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3884/is_200303/ai_n9209497/pg_18/ |date=25 April 2009 }} Journal of Transport History - March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
Kingston's international airport is [[Norman Manley International Airport]] while [[Tinson Pen Aerodrome]] provides domestic services.

===Sea===
Historically, the Kingston waterfront was Jamaica's main port with many [[Pier#Working piers|finger piers]] at which freighters and passenger liners could dock. More recently, with the [[containerisation]] of freight, the port has moved to Newport West.

==Law enforcement==
Jamaica's police force, the [[Jamaica Constabulary Force]], is based on Old Hope Road near [[Liguanea]]. Smaller police stations, such as Hunt's Bay, Matilda's Corner and Half-Way-Tree, are dispersed across the Corporate Area. The Supreme Court of Jamaica is also located in Kingston. Other courts, such as the Half-Way-Tree Resident Magistrate's Court, [[Gun Court]], Traffic Court and Family Court, make Kingston their home. The [[Jamaica Defence Force]] (JDF) has its headquarters at [[Up Park Camp]] near New Kingston and Cross Roads. The JDF also operates a major naval base at Port Royal.

===Fire service===
Fire response in Kingston is provided by the [[Jamaica Fire Brigade]], the national fire service. The service operates from fire stations spread throughout the Corporate Area. Currently fire stations are located at &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamaica Fire Brigade |url=http://www.jamaicafirebrigade.org/stat.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620121015/http://www.jamaicafirebrigade.org/stat.html |archivedate=20 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
The [[Gleaner Company]], the [[Jamaica Observer]] and the Sunday Herald, three of Jamaica's large newspaper companies, make their home in Kingston. Several television and radio stations including [[Television Jamaica]] (TVJ), CVM TV, [[RJR 94 FM]], [[TBC Radio]] 88.5 FM, Hitz 92 FM, FAME 95 FM, LOVE TV, ZIP 103, Kool 97 FM and LOVE FM, are all based in Kingston.

==Sports==

The capital is home to four [[association football]] teams who play in the [[Jamaican Premier League]]. The teams are [[Arnett Gardens F.C.|Arnett Gardens]], [[Boys' Town F.C.|Boy's Town]], [[Harbour View F.C.|Harbour View]], [[Maverley Hughenden]], [[Waterhouse F.C.]].

==Telecommunications==

===Fixed voice and broadband===
Fixed voice and broadband services in Kingston are provided by either [[Flow (brand)|FLOW]] and [[Digicel]] (via their new Digicel Play service which currently exclusive to the Kingston Metropolitan Area). [[Flow (brand)|FLOW]] uses a [[Hybrid fibre-coaxial|Hybrid Fibre and Coaxial]] network to provide IPTV, VoIP &amp; POTS and broadband capable of speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. [[Flow (brand)|FLOW]] also uses a Copper network to provide [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] and [[ADSL]] capable of speeds up to 12 Mbit/s. [[Digicel]] uses a [[GPON]] fibre-optic network, providing IPTV, VoIP and broadband speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s. Digicel's Fibre-optic network boasts capacity of up to 10 Gbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightwaveonline.com/articles/2016/05/digicel-tests-huawei-s-xg-pon-in-jamaica.html|title=Digicel tests Huawei's XG-PON in Jamaica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile voice and broadband===
Mobile voice and broadband services in Kingston are dominated by incumbents, [[Flow (brand)|FLOW]] &amp; [[Digicel]]. Both carriers provide GSM, EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+ and LTE connectivity in and around the city.

Currently, [[Flow (brand)|FLOW]] offers HSPA+ of up to 21 Mbit/s on 850&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz. FLOW also offers [[DC-HSDPA]] (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum.

[[Digicel]] also offers 21 Mbit/s HSPA+ however, they also offer [[DC-HSDPA]] (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 850&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum. [[Digicel]] was also first to market with LTE in Jamaica. Their network covers all of Kingston Parish and most of the populous areas in the Kingston Metropolitan Area, capable of speeds of up to 75 Mbit/s on 10&amp;nbsp;MHz of Band 17 spectrum.

[[Flow (brand)|FLOW]] also offers LTE in Kingston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2016/01/18/flow-jamaica-begins-4g-deployment/|title=FLOW Jamaica begins 4G deployment|first=|last=TeleGeography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flow (brand)|FLOW]]'s LTE network is accessible on Band 4 or AWS spectrum. Due to the network delaying its rollout to acquire more spectrum, its network is theoretically faster than both Digicel and Caricel, to the tune of 150 Mbit/s (20&amp;nbsp;MHz of Bandwidth)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20160726/flow-jamaica-applies-lte-spectrum-high-speed-internet|title=FLOW Jamaica applies for LTE spectrum for high speed Internet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with further plans to add low band spectrum, possibly increasing theoretical speeds up to 225 Mbit/s.

Kingston is also home to [[Caricel]], Jamaica's newest telecoms operator, which deployed its LTE network first to the Kingston Metropolitan Area.

In addition, both carriers have their Jamaican head offices in the city (with the exception of Digicel, which has its company headquarters in Kingston rather than a regional office there as is the case with FLOW, which is based in [[Miami]]).

==Postal service==
Postal services in Kingston and throughout the island are provided by the [[Postal Corporation of Jamaica]], the national post office of Jamaica. Services include domestic and international mail delivery, post office boxes, registered mail, priority mail (local courier), parcel delivery, express mail service (international courier), advertising mail and provision of post office boxes.

Kingston is divided in several postal zones enumerated as follows;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Postal Corporation of Jamaica|url=http://www.jamaicapost.gov.jm/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kirkuk–Haifa oil pipeline''' (also known as the '''Iraq–Haifa pipeline''' or '''Mediterranean pipeline''') was a crude oil pipeline from the oil fields in [[Kirkuk]], located in the former Ottoman vilayet of Mosul in northern [[Iraq]], through [[Jordan]] to [[Haifa]] (in [[Mandatory Palestine|mandatory Palestine]], now in the territory of [[Israel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonné|first1=Alfred|title=The Concessions for the Mosul-Haifa Pipe Line|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=November 1932|volume=164|pages=116–126|jstor=1018964|doi=10.1177/000271623216400115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iraq Petroleum Company, ''AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONSTRUCTION IN THE YEARS 1932 TO 1934 OF THE PIPELINE OF THE IRAQ PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED FROM ITS OILFIELD IN THE VICINITY OF KIRKUK TO THE MEDITERRANEAN PORTS OF HAIFA (Palestine) and TRIPOLI (Lebanon)'', pg. iii&lt;/ref&gt; The pipeline was operational between 1935 and 1948. Its length was about {{convert|942|km}}, with a diameter of {{convert|12|in}} (reducing to {{convert|10|and|8|in}} in parts), and it took about 10&amp;nbsp;days for crude oil to travel the full length of the line. The oil arriving in Haifa was distilled in the [[Oil Refineries Ltd|Haifa refineries]], stored in tanks, and then put in tankers for shipment to Europe.

The pipeline was built by the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] between 1932 and 1934,&lt;ref&gt;Iraq Petroleum Company, ''AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONSTRUCTION IN THE YEARS 1932 TO 1934 OF THE PIPELINE OF THE IRAQ PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED FROM ITS OILFIELD IN THE VICINITY OF KIRKUK TO THE MEDITERRANEAN PORTS OF HAIFA (Palestine) and TRIPOLI (Lebanon)'', pg. iii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PduotC73nh0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA165,M1 The History of the British Petroleum Company, p.164-165]&lt;/ref&gt; during which period most of the area through which the pipeline passed was under a [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate]] approved by the [[League of Nations]]. The pipeline was one of two carrying oil from the [[Baba Gurgur]], [[Kirkuk]] oilfield to the Mediterranean coast. The double pipeline split at [[Haditha]] (Pumping Station K3) with a second line carrying oil to [[Tripoli, Lebanon]], which was then under a French mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Iraq Petroleum Company, ''AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONSTRUCTION IN THE YEARS 1932 TO 1934 OF THE PIPELINE OF THE IRAQ PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED FROM ITS OILFIELD IN THE VICINITY OF KIRKUK TO THE MEDITERRANEAN PORTS OF HAIFA (Palestine) and TRIPOLI (Lebanon)'',&lt;/ref&gt; That line was built primarily to satisfy the demands of the French partner in IPC, ''Compagnie Française des Pétroles'', for a separate line to be built across French mandated territory.

The pipeline and the Haifa refineries were considered strategically important by the British Government, and indeed provided much of the fuel needs of the British and American forces in the Mediterranean during the [[Second World War]].

The pipeline was a target of attacks by Arab gangs during the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], and as a result one of the main objectives of a joint British-Jewish [[Special Night Squads]] commanded by Captain [[Orde Wingate]] was to protect the pipeline against such attacks. Later on, the pipeline was the target of attacks by the [[Irgun]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etzel.org.il/places/israel2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, with the outbreak of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the official operation of the pipeline ended when the Iraqi Government refused to pump any more oil through it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/u-s-checking-possibility-of-pumping-oil-from-northern-iraq-to-haifa-via-jordan-1.98134 U.S. checking possibility of pumping oil from northern Iraq to Haifa, via Jordan - Israel News | Haaretz Daily Newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the [[Russian Empire]]==
'''1902''' M: Mikhail Osipovich Menshikov (1902) - The first textual reference to 
the Protocols, in a far-right newspaper article; claims that they were 
stolen by a "French journalist" in Nice, and quotes a line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===1903===
*In [[Russian language|Russian]], in the newspaper ''[[Znamya (newspaper)|Znamya]]''. The headline in the newspaper was ''Programa zavoevanija mira evrejami'' (''The Jewish Programme to Conquer the World''). The title of ''The Protocols'' (purported) itself was ''The Protocols of the Sessions of the "World Alliance of Freemasons and of the Sages of Zion"''. The publisher was [[Pavel Krushevan]]. Publication was in nine issues of the newspaper, from No. 190 through No. 197 and No. 200, from August to September (old style) or in September (new style).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Non-Existent Manuscript - University of Nebraska Press|url = http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Non-Existent-Manuscript,671722.aspx|website = www.nebraskapress.unl.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Los Placeres''' is an [[archeological site]] located between the “Waspán” and “Tabacalera Nicaragüense” neighborhoods at kilometer 4½ of the “Carretera Norte”, in [[Managua]], en [[Nicaragua]]. The site extends to the coast of [[Lake Managua]]. A large part of the area that delimits the site is being impacted by a new urban settlement known as Barrio Hugo Chávez, which divides the site, where its new settlers have disturbed the ground for installation of pipes for drinking water, toilet and housing, this activity has caused a serious incidental findings and impacts to the [[prehispanic]] archaeological site.

The Sector where the largest concentration of material evidence is on the surface is where excavations and archaeological research was made, mainly in the place that still preserves prehispanic mounds or architectural structures which probably corresponded to domestic or ceremonial areas.

This material is part of the document "Los Placeres, a scientific interest archaeological site.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |author1=Carcía Vazquez, Ramiro |author2=Luvy Pichardo P. |author3=Espinoza Pérez, Edgar |year=2003|title=Los Placeres, un Sitio Arqueológico de Interés Científico|journal=Departamento de Investigaciones Antropológicas, Museo Nacional de Nicaragua|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological Investigation Background==
Due to the internal complexity this site has drawn interest and attention and is catalogued as object of scientific importance and research by the characteristics of its environment, and archaeological evidence observed; a group of archaeologists led by Dr. Frederick Lange in the 1980s (Lange, 1983, Sheets 1983) carried out an inventory and recognition of interest sites in the Pacific area of Nicaragua with the purpose of determining different settlement patterns within the Great Nicoya Sub-Cultural area, this prospection included Los Placeres, finding the presence of multiple chronological periods of occupation 500-800 CE, 800-1350 CE and 1350-1530 CE., and main structures and spatial distribution of potential settlements that inhabited the banks of the Lake and its regional connection by means of the lake.

Dominican Victor Holguín conducted two surveys, the results do not offer much interpretation of cultural material due to lack of knowledge and its classification system (Holguín: 1983). Ten years later, archaeologist Ronaldo Salgado conducted a survey and surface recollection determining that site was probably occupied from 500 to 1500 CE, which coincides with the material analysis of the controlled excavations performed by Stauber in 1996. (Stauber: 1996)

Therefore, it is suggested that apart from this site together with other registered by population impact by the Archaeology Department of the National Museum (Pichardo: 1996), (García: 1996) (Espinoza: 1996) (Zambrana: 1996) located on the shores of Lake Managua that used aquatic and land resources and fertile land for deployment in this area.

It is possible that biological characteristics determined and influenced the way of life, work and ceremonial and funerary practices in prehispanic Managua, and late period at the time of contact (Oviedo: 1976), in his descriptions he mentions a town very prosperous and a beautiful and populous square. ([[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]], 1976: 3 376-377).

For several years after the eighties, natural disasters, water floods, agriculture, erosion, grazing livestock, robberies, lack of budgets and human resources of the cultural institution, destined for archaeological research has minimized research in the area, even with the existence of potential areas considered part of the archaeological reserve of one of the sites with a great information potential, of native people who lived on the shores of Lake Managua. (Stauber: 1996).

By 1996 within the Managua Metropolitan Zone archaeological research project (Lange: et al. 1996) (Stauber: 1996) (Pichardo: 1996) during his second season performed investigation, prospecting and excavation as it was considered a site of great scientific and ethno historical interest, where results determined it to be a multiple components site, represented by different occupation periods, Bagaces (300-800 CE), Sapoa (800-1350 CE), Ometepe (1350-1550 CE) and foreign contacts according to diagnosed pottery,  also found a variety of domestic residues  represented by the different ceramic types (Stauber: 1996) and [[Stone tool|lithic]] stone artifacts for hunting, fishing, grinding, also the location and distribution of several mounds where quantity and density of surface archaeological material is evident; where it is possible to affirm that there was a large population concentration.

During these excavations (Stauber: 1996) as result of the analysis of the material, concluded with emphasis on regional trade with groups of the central part and the Pacific through the lake, a possible social stratified organization, with emphasis on local organization.

What has not yet been reported on any field report and material analysis, of the aforementioned in the Los Placeres archaeological history (Stauber: 1996) is the evidence of burial areas.

It is necessary to systematically extend research and with scientific rigor with the purpose of defining burial spaces and obtain data related to prehispanic burial patterns on the site.

It should be noted that the population has impacted many secondary burials in Sacasa striated type urns (Bonilla ''et al.'' 1990), with small offerings pots, in different Managua settlements; mainly located on banks of Lake Managua, and other burial findings found in neighboring sites, as in Barrio Domitilla Lugo, El Rodeo (Pichardo: 1996), Las Torres (Garcia, Vázquez: 1996), and the San Cristobal site (Weiss: 1983).

It is likely that each hamlet or native settlement demarcated its burial area, because it is a decisive element to define social stratification by its funerary trousseau and the spatial distribution of the site and the village.

At the site Las Torres (Garcia: 1996) close to the lake shore, an important funeral pattern was found, scientifically recorded during archaeological investigations to develop in the area of the Metropolitan area of Managua and could determine a social stratification and form of collective burials or family based on spatial distribution and funerary trousseau.

The materials studied by Stauber within the second archaeological research season in the Metropolitan Zone (1996) the percentage of classified and scanned material, reported a strong presence and percentage of Sacasa striated type (Bonilla ''et al.'' 1990: 227) and suggests that perhaps had utilitarian and household use.

Within the main Sacasa ceramics burials, frequently over 50% of excavated materials depicted specific uses and utilitarian purposes represented in dishes called tecomates, [[ollas]] with enlarged outward edge, and outside of the utilitarian function, Sacasa seems to have had significance as burial pottery. (Bonilla: 228) represented in the funerary urns, boot or shoe shaped.

==Prehispanic Funerary Urns==
[[File:Placeres 2.png|thumb|300px|Placeres Double Burial. Detail of remains of child and mother.]]
During urbanization work and activities near a House, 4 prehispanic funeral urns were found, one of them large was placed in the center with a circular lid possibly Sacasa Striated type (800 BC-1350 DC, Bonilla ''et al.'' 227). Lack of current population awareness and the interest by the belief that it contained treasures; artifacts were completely destroyed and altered the context and archaeological record. Lack of prevention and supervision causes that each day more sites are destroyed and therefore the archaeological information.

All recovered parts were inventoried and taken to the restoration and laboratory of the Anthropology Department of the National Museum for their proper restoration, conservation and study by archaeologists.

Most urns and the skeletal remains are completely fragmented making it almost impossible to determine its context and spatial distribution; it is not possible to determine sex or age of the individuals.

In general and according to burials characteristics found in the Pacific area and the coast of Lake Managua (Garcia: 1996) it is a funerary component possibly of one or two individuals due to the amount of Sacasa Striated type urns shoe shaped, also possibly associated with Papagayo ceramic polychrome fragments (800-1350 DC).

Other ceramic types associated with children burials is Las Brisas (not yet dated) where a funerary burial was found and the Sitio del Ferrocarril site in the city of Managua (Zambrana: 1996). Also at the laboratory are two shoe shaped miniature Sacasa Striated vessels associated with the funeral component where it is supposed that these had remnants of food or fish bone (García: 1999).

An archaeological recovery was made by a trench 6 x 4 meters long and width respectively, the excavation was abandoned for more than 15 days, were objects and human remains were displayed of the prehispanic inhabitants of the site.

Excavation had reached a depth of approximately 35 to 40 centimeters depth at the time it was abandoned.

Each of the funerary urns was coded using numbers 1 to 8, then surface cleaning was made and proceeded to excavate around before lifting, it must be clarified that most of these burials were already completely excavated and suffered vandalism. The maximum burial depth approximately ranges from 75 to 80 centimeters, only the oblong funeral urns were seated on the geological stratum known as Talpetate.

==The Site==
Current residents have built latrines and in most archeological remains have been found; vegetation consists of fruit trees, bananas, and ornamental plants in the houses. Soils are sedimentary; clay with very fine light brown sand residues, the fertile stratum ranges between 30 and 40 centimeters in thickness in succession appears the Talpetate stratum.

==Spatial Burial Distribution==
[[File:Placeres 3.png|thumb|300px|Placeres Double Burial. Offerings detail at the foot of the human remains, turtle shell (?), pottery round jar and ceramics.]]
Interpretation made about this burials area is that they seem to be distributed in the following manner and its description is made according to their north-south location: there are four red slip oblong-shaped funerary pottery urns of type known as Sacasa Striated located in north, south, east and west positions as if representing the four cardinal points.

'''Burial 1:''' It is a secondary funeral urn burial, 60 centimeters in diameter which was discovered by the west side of the trench, was superficially fragmented and contents at the top disturbed, was aligned with burials 2, 8, and 3, which correspond to urns shoes shaped burials.

'''Burials 2, 8 &amp; 3:'''  Were located in the center of the excavation between the urn 1 located on the west side, these are medium urns shoe shaped of the Sacasa Striated ceramic type, they were aligned with the tip east to west, the urn on the east side of the excavation was destroyed, as well as primary burial which corresponded to the human bones of an individual with the skull oriented to the west, the specimen was buried with extended hands facing where the sun rises. Anthropological biometric and cultural context data that could have been retrieved from these human bones was lost due to its total destruction.

'''Burial 4:''' By the southwest side of the excavation associated with funerary urn 7, oblong shape urn 4 ) shoe-shaped was found, the tip in position  west, aligned with urns 1 and 6; while cleaning it human remains were found that correspond to lower limbs of an adult specimen, the  bone remnants were found at the west of the urn.

'''Burial 5:'''
It was located exactly at the center of Northern excavation profile and refers to a funeral urn, it is the only one that did not suffer disturbance except for the vessel which served as cover of the same; it was on a straight line from urns 7 &amp; 8 and oriented north to south.

'''Burial 6:'''  Between funeral urns burial 1 and 7, next to the southwest corner of the excavation found burial 6, which consists of an oblong ceramic Sacas Striated type and with a Murillo neck vessel applied which functioned as the urn lid, this urn type was the only one that had a different pottery type, is possible that the use of this type of ceramic mark a cultural burials differentiation, the medium shoe-shaped urns belong to infant burials and there is only one child buried in a medium oblong urn Sacasa Striated type, that was also disturbed.

'''Burial 7:''' It is an oblong ceramic Sacasa Striated vessel, located at the south and associated with burials 4 and 8 and in a straight line with funerary urn number 5. Only the burial mold was found where it was deposited on the Talpetate stratum, disappeared from the excavation and the whereabouts of prehispanic object is unknown, also lost is the cultural information.

'''Burial 8:''' It is a medium prehispanic piece shoe shaped, only the mold impression was found, left on a clay layer, disappeared from the excavation and cultural information was lost.

About these cultural vestiges two possibilities are inferred; the first is that it is related to a primary burial, disturbed or altered at the excavation time and second that the human remains were placed alongside the urn as funerary offerings. At the top of the ground of the dirt that contained this urn the mold or footprint where the small vessel was located that probably was the funeral offering of an infant. This burial was also disturbed and stolen.

All objects used in the burial ceremony were oblong and shape shoe ceramic Sacasa Striated Urn type and only one distinguished by having a lid made from ceramic Murillo neck applied type.

It must be established that all burials were disturbed and stolen and that the prehispanic objects corresponding to burials 7-8 and the urn 6) lid disappeared and their whereabouts is unknown. Funeral burial or urn number 9 which was associated with the bones of a direct burial by this sector of the trench was completely destroyed by the person that performed the excavation.

==Laboratory Work==
In relation to the ceramic it can be asserted that only three types of ceramics are reported: Sacasa Striated, Murillo neck applied, some Papagayo polychrome ceramic pots, there were basalt and chalcedony lithic chips.

Funerary urns were transferred to the laboratory with part of their archaeological contents were burials urns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

==Osteology Analysis==
Analysis conducted on the archaeological evidence found in each of the urns provided the following data: Urn 1: diameter of 60 x 55&amp;nbsp;cm width and height respectively, found at between 30 and 40&amp;nbsp;cm depth relative to the edge of the urn begun appearing the first bone fragments.

The first anatomical part discovered was part of the skull which was placed face-down, the ribs, shoulder, scapulae and phalanxes were associated with the [[humerus]] and [[ulna]] – left side [[radius]] on the left side of the head. Lower limb of the skeletal remains were on the right side of the skull, the [[femur]]s below and the [[tibia]] - [[fibula]]e above, the [[human pelvis|pelvis]] and [[vertebra]]e residues were below the [[human skull|skull]].

According to the biological characteristics of the bone and based on teeth wear, the human remains seem to correspond to an adult female specimen, aged 30 to 35 years approximately.

Furthermore, there were deciduous teeth remains or milk molar, premolar, canine and incisive, which appear to approximately correspond to a 1 to 2 years old child. Unfortunately the conservation state of the long bones did not permit obtaining biometric data to infer about the height of the adult individual.

Inside two small vases were found, one oblong shaped, flat base and wide mouth (8&amp;nbsp;cm) short-necked measuring 8 x 11&amp;nbsp;cm in height and width, Sacasa Striated ceramic type. The second corresponds to a small vessel with socket base, short neck; red slip probably associated with the red Rivas ceramic, measured 9 x 10&amp;nbsp;cm, height and width, and the mouth diameter is 5.2&amp;nbsp;cm.

These vessels are considered funerary offerings that relatives or family deposited with their dead at the time of the burial ceremony. Surely human remains deposited in this urn belonged to the mother and her baby, a collective family burial in a zone of burials.

'''URN 2:''' Corresponds to a prehispanic piece shoe shaped with the following dimensions: Length 40, width 28, height 31 and mouth diameter 21.5&amp;nbsp;cm, was recovered completely fragmented and altered, at the bottom of the urn were found remains of temporary dental or deciduous molars, premolars, canine and incisors that seem to correspond to an infant aged 6 to 8 years approximately.

'''URN 3:''' This artifact is similar to the previous one and has the same dimensions, inside a chalcedony chip was found, 2 of flint stone, and one of basalt. In the cleaning process animal remains were collected corresponding to fish vertebrae, amphibians, and evidence of vegetal remains and wildlife with combustion evidence (coal).

Human remains consist of very small residues including temporary dental parts or milk teeth: Molars 3, premolars 2, the four canines and 4 incisors. According to the biological characteristics of teeth roughly appear to belong to a child aged 12 to 18 months.

Mixed with the children remains 92 elaborate necklace beads made from clay cylindrical shape were found, round shape decorated in brown and black, they probably formed a small baby necklace that was possibly worn around his neck as a body adornment.

From these burials is the only reported with this type of offering, in addition to lithic residues and fauna remains; this evidence probably constitute the child funerary dress that could be considered as a cultural differentiation element with regard to the "social status" of the individual.

Associated with this urn skeletal remains were discovered that seem to correspond to an adult specimen and was directly deposited on soil or direct burial. The human bones of this burial were destroyed by some local children who threw stones and subsequently the skeleton was destroyed completely by the person that commenced the excavation, this action against cultural property was completely vandalism.
           
'''URN 4:''' This was located by the south end near the southwest corner of the excavation; it is a medium-sized urn equal to the previous and the same ceramic type. While being rescued it was found in the same fragmented state and stolen.

At the laboratory remains of human bones were found inside, which corresponds to a child. Probably the infant relatives deposited a small vase as offering, the dirt containing the urn still had the mold of the small vessel that was extracted and stolen by vandals.

While retrieving the remains human remains were found at the west side of the urn, it is inferred  this was a primary burial, probably disrupted, and probably buried with the body pointing south to north; the human remains seem to correspond to fragments of an adult lower limb, gender and age undetermined.

'''URN 5:''' It is an oblong Sacasa Striated ceramic type with dimensions of 60 X 60&amp;nbsp;cm in height and diameter respectively, its mouth measures 30&amp;nbsp;cm long and was located in the center of the northern excavation.

This funeral burial is possibly the least damaged because it was only partially unearthed; only the urn upper part and the lid vessel were damaged by predators.

To extract this urn its content was partially excavated "in situ", then packaged and carefully moved to the laboratory. Using the same methodology that was used in the cleaning of the previous urns allowed us to obtain the following information:

Excavation was made in small layers and at about 20 – 25&amp;nbsp;cm depth relative to the edge of the urn began to appear the first human skeletal remains, then discovered a skull, which was carefully cleaned discovering it had been placed face down, vertebrae, sternum, ribs, and shoulder were on both sides the head, skull was oriented towards the east.

Among the human remains, the following dental pieces were found: lateral superior incisive left, and right and the central, two central lower incisive, canine superior left and right and bottom right, M1, M2, lower rights M3, M1, M2, M3 left inferior, left upper M3, Pm1, higher rights Pm2, Pm1, upper left Pm2, Pm1, lower rights Pm2, Pm1, left Pm2 lower.

Well-formed cusps are seen in all the molars, there is no enamel attrition, and teeth wear is in acceptable condition what indicate that these belong to a young person.

On the basis of morphological burials as the mastoid process, the jaw, wears and biological characteristics of their teeth it is inferred that these belong to a young female specimen, aged 18 to 21 years approximately.

Pathology: Only the M2 showed decay evidence (spots), and low concentration of tartar dental cement in most teeth.

Below the woman skull, in sequence were found, cranial bones that according to their anatomical characteristics and biological seem to correspond to a male specimen, who was placed face-down oriented north; seems to be that the lower extremities of both individuals were package deposited in east-west direction and upper extremities north-south. Clavicles, vertebrae, ribs, etc. were found on both sides of the head, as well as the woman.

Among the unearthed human remains are: A fragment of the left jaw branch that preserves dental pieces M1 and M2, a fragment of the jaw left side which preserves in its anatomical position dental pieces Pm1 Pm2, M1, M2 is observed that wear is homogeneous in all the molars.

Among dental disarticulated pieces the following were found: right upper lateral incisor, a lower left canine, lower molars M2 left and right, the premolars Pm1, superior Pm2 left and right, 5 dental pieces, not possible to determine their anatomical position due to its conservation state.

The exception is in M2, presents a much more marked wear, it is likely that this type of tooth abrasion was due to the individual using his teeth as a tool.
According to the biological characteristics of the skull, jaws, long bones and tooth wear leads to conclude that these belong to a mature male adult of about 30 to 35 years of age.

Associated with the previously described human remains is a right jaw branch piece which preserves its molar temporary M1 anatomical position (or milk) with much wear and the premolar Pm2 still in the alveolar orifice in the process of emergency.

We is recorded a fragment of the left jaw that retains in anatomical position premolars Pm1 and Pm2 as deciduous teeth and is observed in the alveoli molar M1 permanent in emergency process.  On the basis of these data it is inferred that the skeletal remains could correspond to an infant aged 10 to 12 years approximately.

Pathology: Observed decay evidence in molars and tartar concentration in most teeth, did not observe any sort of disease in the long bones caused by pathological problems.

'''URN 6:''' It is an oblong medium funerary urn with the following dimensions: diameter 43&amp;nbsp;cm, height 35, mouth measuring 25&amp;nbsp;cm. The urn was located south of urn number 1.

On the West side of the urn, human remains were found possibly part of a femur oriented north-south, it is likely that this was a direct burial that was disturbed at the time of depositing the urn.

Among the human remains are present remains of a skull, a temporary molar, and remains of the upper and lower limbs. The remains suggest that it is a child of about 7 to 9 years of age. Bone fragments have a poor conservation status.

'''URNS 7 &amp; 8:''' Correspond to a child and adult burials, were extracted and stolen, unknown destinations, information was supplied by the residents of the place.

Funeral Burial 9 &amp; 10: Corresponded to a large urn, similar to 5 and a primary funeral urn, the remains seemed to be an adult specimen; the skeletal remains were destroyed and trampled by Jorge Espinoza. This is considered as a vandalism act to the archaeological and cultural assets of the nation, these cases of destruction of predation should be disclosed to society.

==Funerary Practices in Prehispanic Managua==
Funeral patterns practiced by prehispanic native settlers of Managua, interesting information is available, as is the case of archaeological records of burials with funerary trousseau that set or marked social stratification.

The presence of a main burial is a sign of social stratification. The use of artifacts and green stones, are burials establishing the difference.  As a rule, offerings characteristics are better indicators of social rank when they can be associated with personal data of the deceased, such as age and gender. E.g., a case of range acquired by kinship, unlike that achieved by merit, would be represented in the tomb of a teenage individual buried with authority and opulence symbols.

The status distinctions have proved to be more difficult to determine that the ranks, especially in archaeological context for which there is no ethno historic or ethnographic direct analogy.  This is the case when horizontal affiliation markers are perishable and survive as archaeological evidence; decorations painted on bodies, clothing, or hairstyles. (Garcia in Lange: 1996: 115).

These types of secondary burials in funerary Urns seem to be the most common forms of the ceremony of burials; but in recent years that applied analysis on human bones unearthed some urns from different sites in the metropolitan area of Managua and the country found skeletal remains belong to 2 or 3 dismembered individuals, deposited in a same Urn.

Osteological analysis leads to infer that these were real families or that have a kinship as in the case of the urn number 5, a man, a woman and infant human remains were found had no clothes, probably related to common society members that were buried in a collective burial or a mound.

Burials, often in a mound, were practiced in all parts of Nicaragua, and almost in the entire Nicoya peninsula.  In Guacas and Las Casitas, Hartman (1907ª, p.&amp;nbsp;15), could not determine the profile of hole where the body was placed, due to the special nature of the soil. These sites, and certainly in many others, prevailed secondary funeral, and body bones were piled around the skull. (Lothrop. V-I page 93) down.

==Sacasa Striated Ceramic, Cultural Aspects==
All urns and vessels belonging to the type, with the exception of a small red slip bowl, belongs to funerary offerings.

The main burials diagnostic is that areas not covered with grooves or brush are made after cooking.  Decoration is based on live forms, especially animal shapes and strips are applied and grooved.  Finally, a number of such urns are shoe shaped.

On the surface finish, the pots are observed scrapped inside and inside show brush, and stripes on the outside, while the earthenware display brushing on the inside surface and have a polished red slip.

The most frequently represented animals are rodents, bats, peccaries and growling jaguars. Strips frequently applied with grooves, are disposed in spiral or long circles. Other models were used to depict rough eyes, eyebrows and other facial features, as well, round knots, buttons etc.

The grooves are dominant decoration, however, they seem to have been made with strong, bristle brush, to scrape smooth surface without slip before cooking. The grooves tend to run horizontally around the vessel. Often groove markings in different directions, suggesting that the brushing technique was to completely cover the urn, modeling quickly and with meticulous care.

It seems that this ceramic had many uses, in addition to its domestic function. A good number of funerary urns of this kind were found by Bransford (1881), lacking edge, suggesting that these could be removed while placing the body of the deceased inside, showing that this vessels were not always designed to be used as urns. (Lothrop, 1926: 254).

This ceramic type marks a break with early traditions. It became the most important and common household type from the Apompua phase until the Spanish conquest (Haberland, 1986; 1992).

Bransford (1881) found Sacasa Striated accompanied by earthenware Luna Polychrome, indicating the contemporaneity of both types (Garcia in Lange, 1996: 117).

[[Personal protective equipment]], administrative controls, and engineering controls can all work to reduce exposure to noise and chemicals, either by providing the worker with protection such as [[earplug]]s, or by reducing the [[noise]] or chemicals at the source or limiting the time or level of exposure.

== Background ==
OHL is defined as any type of hearing loss, i.e. [[Sensorineural hearing loss|sensorineural]], [[Conductive hearing loss|conductive]], or mixed hearing loss, that occurs due to hazardous characteristics of a work environment.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim KS | title = Occupational hearing loss in Korea | language = English | journal = Journal of Korean Medical Science | volume = 25 | issue = Suppl | pages = S62-9 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21258593 | doi = 10.3346/jkms.2010.25.s.s62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing loss can range in severity from mild to profound.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Hazards of a [[Workplace|work environment]] that can result in OHL include excessive noise, ototoxic chemicals, or physical trauma.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; OHL caused by excessive exposure to noise is also known as [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL). Noise exposure combined with ototoxic chemical exposure can results in more damage to hearing. OHL caused by physical trauma may include foreign bodies in the ear, vibration, [[barotrauma]], or [[head injury]]. OHL, as well as hearing loss in general, can cause negative secondary social and emotional effects that can impact quality of life.&lt;ref name="pmid14570962"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalton DS, Cruickshanks KJ, Klein BE, Klein R, Wiley TL, Nondahl DM | title = The impact of hearing loss on quality of life in older adults | journal = The Gerontologist | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 661–8 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14570962 | doi = 10.1093/geront/43.5.661 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12918624"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arlinger S | title = Negative consequences of uncorrected hearing loss--a review | journal = International Journal of Audiology | volume = 42 Suppl 2 | issue = | pages = 2S17–20 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12918624 | doi = | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stig_Arlinger/publication/10612964_Negative_consequences_of_uncorrected_hearing_loss_-_A_review/links/0912f502caf00a31ce000000/Negative-consequences-of-uncorrected-hearing-loss-A-review.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[United States|United States of America]], approximately 10 million people have NIHL. Over twice that number (~22 million) are occupationally exposed to dangerous noise levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/default.html|title=Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention|last=NIOSH|first=|date=Mar 22, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing loss accounted for a sizable percentage of occupational illness in 2007, at 14% of cases.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html|title=CDC - Facts and Statistics: Noise - NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  United States government agencies such as [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] and [[Mine Safety and Health Administration|MSHA]]  are working to understand the causes of OHL and how it can be prevented while providing regulations and guidelines to help protect the hearing of workers in all occupations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Noise exposure ===
Exposure to noise can cause [[vibration]]s able to cause permanent damage to the ear. Both the volume of the noise and the duration of exposure can influence the likelihood of damage. Sound is measured in units called [[decibel]]s, which is a [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] scale of sound levels that corresponds to the level of loudness that an individual's ear would perceive. Because it is a logarithmic scale, even small incremental increases in decibels correlate to large increases in loudness, and an increase in the risk of hearing loss.

Sounds above 80&amp;nbsp;dB have the potential to cause permanent hearing loss. The intensity of sound is considered too great and hazardous if someone must yell in order to be heard. [[Ringing in the ears]] upon leaving work is also indicative of noise that is at a dangerous level. Farming, machinery work, and construction are some of the many occupations that put workers at risk of hearing loss.

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] establishes recommended exposure limits (RELs) to protect workers against the health effects of exposure to hazardous substances and agents encountered in the workplace. These NIOSH limits are based on the best available science and practices.  NIOSH established the REL for occupational noise exposures to be 85 decibels, A-weighted (dB[A]) as an 8-hour time-weighted average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf|title=Criteria for a Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure|last=NIOSH|first=|date=1998|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational noise exposure at or above this level are considered hazardous. The REL is based on exposures at work 5 days per week and assumes that the individual spends the other 16 hours in the day, as well as weekends, in quieter conditions. NIOSH also specifies a maximum allowable daily noise dose, expressed in percentages. For example, a person continuously exposed to 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A) over an 8-hour work shift will reach 100% of their daily noise dose. This dose limit uses a 3-dB time-intensity tradeoff commonly referred to as the exchange rate or equal-energy rule: for every 3-dB increase in noise level, the allowable exposure time is reduced by half.  For example, if the exposure level increases to 88&amp;nbsp;dB(A), workers should only be exposed for four hours.  Alternatively, for every 3-dB decrease in noise level, the allowable exposure time is doubled, as shown in the table below.

OSHA's current [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) for workers is an average of 90&amp;nbsp;dB over an 8-hour work day. Unlike NIOSH, OSHA uses a 5-dB exchange rate, where an increase in 5-dB for a sound corresponds to the amount of time workers may be exposed to that particular source of sound being halved. For example, workers cannot be exposed to a sound level of 95&amp;nbsp;dB for more than 4 hours per day, or to sounds at 100&amp;nbsp;dB for more than 2 hours per day. Employers who expose workers to 85&amp;nbsp;dB or more for 8 hour shifts are required to provide hearing exams and protection, monitor noise levels, and provide training.

[[File:NIOSHSoundLevelMeter.jpg|alt=NIOSH Sound Level Meter app using iPhone 7 and external microphone|thumb|The NIOSH Sound Level Meter app]]
[[Sound level meter]]s and [[Noise dosimeter|dosimeters]] are two types of devices that are used to measure sound levels in the workplace. Dosimeters are typically worn by the employee to measure their own personal sound exposure. Other sound level meters can be used to double check dosimeter measurements, or used when dosimeters cannot be worn by the employees. They can also be used to evaluate engineering controls aimed at reducing noise levels.

Some recent studies suggest that some smartphone applications may be able to measure noise as precisely as a Type 2 SLM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kardous CA, Shaw PB | title = Evaluation of smartphone sound measurement applications | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 135 | issue = 4 | pages = EL186-92 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 25236152 | pmc = 4659422 | doi = 10.1121/1.4865269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27794313"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kardous CA, Shaw PB | title = Evaluation of smartphone sound measurement applications (apps) using external microphones-A follow-up study | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 140 | issue = 4 | pages = EL327 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27794313 | pmc = 5102154 | doi = 10.1121/1.4964639 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most smartphone sound measurement apps are not accurate enough to be used for legally required measurements, the [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/app.html NIOSH Sound Level Meter app] met the requirements of IEC 61672/ANSI S1.4 Sound Level Meter Standards (Electroacoustics - Sound Level Meters - Part 3: Periodic Tests).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celestina|first=Metod|last2=Hrovat|first2=Jan|last3=Kardous|first3=Chucri A. | name-list-format = vanc |date=October 2018|title=Smartphone-based sound level measurement apps: Evaluation of compliance with international sound level meter standards|journal=Applied Acoustics|volume=139|pages=119–128|doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2018.04.011|issn=0003-682X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ototoxic chemical exposure ===
Chemically-induced hearing loss (CIHL) is a potential result of occupational exposures. Certain chemical compounds may have [[Ototoxicity|ototoxic]] effects.[https://synergist.aiha.org/201811-the-ear-poisons] Exposure to [[organic solvents]], [[Heavy Metals|heavy metals]], and [[Asphyxiant gas|asphyxiants]] such as [[carbon monoxide]] can all cause hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://osha.europa.eu/en/tools-and-publications/publications/literature_reviews/combined-exposure-to-noise-and-ototoxic-substances|title=Combined exposure to noise and ototoxic substances|last=EU-OSHA|first=European Agency for Safety and Health at Work|date=2009|website=Combined exposure to noise and ototoxic substances|publisher=EU OSHA|access-date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ohl/default.html|title = CDC - NIOSH Topic: Occupational Hearing Loss (OHL) Surveillance|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals can be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. Damage can occur to either the inner ear or the auditory nerve.Certain medications may also have the potential to cause hearing loss.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/worksafe/ototoxic-chemicals-chemicals-result-hearing-loss|title = Ototoxic chemicals - chemicals that result in hearing loss|website = Department of Commerce Western Australia|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both noise and chemical exposures are common in many industries, and can both contribute to hearing loss simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campo P, Morata TC, Hong O | title = Chemical exposure and hearing loss | journal = Disease-A-Month | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 119–38 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23507352 | pmc = 4693596 | doi = 10.1016/j.disamonth.2013.01.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage may be more likely or more severe if both are present, in particular if noise is impulsive.&lt;ref name="pmid29604694"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fuente A, Qiu W, Zhang M, Xie H, Kardous CA, Campo P, Morata TC | title = Use of the kurtosis statistic in an evaluation of the effects of noise and solvent exposures on the hearing thresholds of workers: An exploratory study | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 143 | issue = 3 | pages = 1704 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29604694 | doi = 10.1121/1.5028368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Venet T, Campo P, Thomas A, Cour C, Rieger B, Cosnier F | title = The tonotopicity of styrene-induced hearing loss depends on the associated noise spectrum | journal = Neurotoxicology and Teratology | volume = 48 | pages = 56–63 | pmid = 25689156 | doi = 10.1016/j.ntt.2015.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industries in which combinations of exposures may exist include construction, fiberglass, metal manufacturing, and many more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is estimated that over 22 million workers are exposed to dangerous noise levels, and 10 million are exposed to solvents that could potentially cause hearing loss every year, with an unknown number exposed to other ototoxic chemicals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A 2018 informational bulletin by the US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) introduces the issue, provides examples of ototoxic chemicals, lists the industries and occupations at risk and provides prevention information.[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-124/pdfs/2018-124.pdf]

== Prevention ==
OHL is preventable, but currently the interventions to prevent NIHL are complex. A 2017 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] review&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tikka C, Verbeek JH, Kateman E, Morata TC, Dreschler WA, Ferrite S | title = Interventions to prevent occupational noise-induced hearing loss | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = CD006396 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28685503 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006396.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that hearing loss prevention programs revealed that stricter legislation might reduce noise levels. [[Hearing protection devices]], such as [[earmuffs]] and [[earplug]]s can reduce noise exposure to safe levels, but, instructions are needed on how to put plugs into the ears correctly to achieve potential attenuation. Giving workers information on their noise exposure levels by itself was not shown to decrease noise. Engineering solutions might lead to similar noise reduction as that provided by hearing protection. Better evaluation of the noise exposures resulting from engineering interventions is needed, as most of the available information is limited to observations in laboratory conditions. Overall, the effects of hearing loss prevention programs are unclear. Better use of hearing protection as part of a program but does not necessarily protect against hearing loss. The review concluded that in order to prevent NIHL in the workplace the quality of the implementation of prevention programs affects results, and that better quality of studies, especially in the field of engineering controls, and better implementation of legislation are needed. While the 2017 systematic review concluded there is a lack of conclusive evidence it highlighted that this should not be interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness. The implications is that further research could affect conclusions reached.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Hierarchy of controls ===
{{Main|Hierarchy of hazard control}}
[[File:NIOSH Hierarchy of Controls.png|alt=NIOSH Hierarchy of Controls showing elimination as most effective, followed by substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and then as lease effective are personal protective equipment|thumb|350x350px|NIOSH Hierarchy of Controls]]
The [[Hierarchy of hazard control|hierarchy of controls]] provides a visual guide to the effectiveness of the various workplace controls set in place to eliminate or reduce exposure to occupational hazards, including noise or ototoxic chemicals. The hierarchy includes the following from most effective to least effective:
* [[Hazard elimination|Elimination]]: complete removal of the hazard
* [[Hazard substitution|Substitution]]: replacement that offers a smaller risk
* [[Engineering controls]]: physical changes to reduce exposure
* [[Administrative controls]]: changes in work procedures or training
* [[Personal protective equipment]] (PPE): individual equipment to reduce exposure, e.g. [[earplug]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saunions.org.au/ohs/hierachy_of_controls.htm|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=SA Unions|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Engineering controls ====
[[Engineering controls]] is the next highest in the [[hierarchy]] of risk reduction methods when elimination and substitution of the hazard are not possible. These types of controls typically involve making changes in equipment or other changes to minimize the level of noise that reaches a worker's ear. They may also involve measures such as barriers between the worker and the source of the noise, mufflers, regular maintenance of the machinery, or substituting quieter equipment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noisecontrol/|title=NIOSH - Engineering Noise Control - Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://miningsh.arizona.edu/node/46|title=Noise controls (Engineering, Administrative, PPE) {{!}} Mining Safety &amp; Health Resource Center|website=miningsh.arizona.edu|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OSHA Technical Manual (OTM) on noise provides technical information about workplace hazards and controls to OSHA’s Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/new_noise/index.html|title=OSHA Technical Manual - Noise|last=OSHA|first=|date=Aug 15, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the OTM is based on currently available research publications, OSHA standards, and consensus standards. The OTM is available to the public for use by other health and safety professionals, employers, and anyone involved in developing or implementing an effective workplace safety and health program.

Examples of noise control strategies adopted in the workplace can be seen among the winners of the [[Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Awards.]]

==== Administrative controls ====
[[Administrative controls|Administrative control]], behind engineering control, is the next best form of prevention of noise exposure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They can either reduce the exposure to noise, or reduce the decibel level of the noise itself. Limiting the amount of time a worker is allowed to be around an unsafe level of noise exposure, and creating procedures for operation of equipment that could produce harmful levels of noise are both examples of administrative controls.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Personal protection ====
{{Main|Personal protective equipment}}
Elimination or reduction of the source of noise or chemical exposure is ideal, but when that is not possible or adequate, wearing [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) such as earplugs or earmuffs can help reduce the risk of hearing loss due to noise exposure. PPE should be a last resort and  not be used in substitution for engineering or administrative controls. It is important that workers are properly trained on the use of PPE to ensure proper protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Other initiatives ===
In addition to the hierarchy of controls, other programs have been created to promote the prevention of hearing loss in the workplace. For example, the [[Buy Quiet]] program was created to encourage the purchase of quieter tools and machinery in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/|title=Buy Quiet|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Safe-In-Sound Award|Safe-n-Sound Award]] was created to recognize organizations that excel in preventing occupational hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeinsound.us/|title=Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Safe-in-Sound|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Occupational hearing loss is a very present industrial issue that has been noticed since the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sataloff |first1=Robert Thayer |last2=Sataloff |first2=Joseph | name-list-format = vanc |title=Occupational hearing loss |date=1993 |publisher=M. Dekker |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8247-8814-8 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; As industrial society continues to grow, this issue is becoming increasingly detrimental due to the exposure of chemicals and physical objects. Millions of employees have been affected by occupational hearing loss, especially in industry.&lt;ref name="pmid11500698"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Otaibi ST | title = Occupational hearing loss | journal = Saudi Medical Journal | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 523–30 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 11500698 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrialized countries see most of these damages as they result in both economic and living problems.

Within the United States of America alone, 10 of the 28 million people that have experienced hearing loss related to noise exposure. Rarely do workers express concerns or complaints regarding Occupational hearing loss. In order to gather relevant information, workers who have experienced loud work environments are questioned regarding their hearing abilities during everyday activities. When analyzing OHP, it is necessary to consider family history, hobbies, recreational activities, and how they could play a role in a person’s hearing loss. In order to test hearing loss, [[audiometer]]s are used to and are adjusted to [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) regulations. The Occupation and Safety Health Association (OSHA) of the United States of America requires a program that conserves hearing when noise levels are greater than 85&amp;nbsp;dB. This program includes:
1.”Monitoring to assess and record noise levels.”
2. “Periodic audiometry.”
3. “Noise Control”
4. “Education and record keeping.”

It premiered in 1956 in Rio de Janeiro. The play became the basis for the films ''Orfeu Negro'' (''[[Black Orpheus]]'', 1959) and ''[[Orfeu]]'' (1999), and for the musicals ''Orfeu'' (Brazil, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.showbras.com.br/orfeu/orfeu_RELEASE.html ''Orfeu''], background and production details {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Black Orpheus'' (Broadway, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/193206-Lynn-Nottage-Will-Pen-Stage-Adaptation-of-Black-Orpheus-George-C-Wolfe-to-Direct "Lynn Nottage Will Pen Stage Adaptation of ''Black Orpheus''; George C.

'''Pierre Johanns''' (1 April 1882, [[Heinerscheid]], [[Luxembourg]] - 8 February 1955, [[Arlon]], [[Belgium]]) was a [[Luxembourg|Luxemburger]] [[Jesuit]] priest, missionary in [[India]] and [[Indology|Indologist]].

[[File:Pierre Johanns (1882-1955).jpg|thumb|Pierre Johanns (1882-1955).]]

==Education==
Johanns was ordained priest on 1 August 1914 at Louvain, three days before World War I broke out and Germany invaded Belgium. He had studied philosophy under the prestigious metaphysician and mystic, [[Pierre Scheuer]]. Johanns' superior intelligence, nearing genius, had been recognized and he was destined to further studies while awaiting a still impeded passage to India. He took a full Licentiate in Philosophy from the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] (Belgium), and was then sent to [[Oxford]] as soon as the end of the war permitted it, in 1919. To evaluate his doctoral dissertation on "The Agent Intellect in the Western and Eastern Philosophies," Oxford University could not find suitable examiners, and had to have recourse to Cambridge. From there came the extraordinary verdict: "only once in a hundred years does one meet such an intellect." Oxford gave him the doctorate with the highest honours and offered him, despite his being a Roman Catholic and Jesuit, a professorship. But his call was for Calcutta, which he reached in November 1921. He taught philosophy at [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta]], at St Mary's, the [[Jesuit]] theologate at [[Kurseong]], [[Darjeeling]], and even in a Vaisnava monastery. He studied ever more deeply the Hindu tradition. Because he always approached the Real in terms of Value, he felt attuned to the aims and methods of Vedanta. As early as October 1922, he and another Oxford graduate and Jesuit confrere, Georges Dandoy, started ''[[The Light of the East]]'', a monthly directed to the Hindu intelligentsia as an instrument of interfaith reflection and dialogue. His contributions amounted to 216, 146 of which constitute the work ''To Christ through the Vedanta''. In 1938 ill health forced him to go back to Belgium, where he nevertheless founded an "Indian Juniorate" which, until 1955, would train young Jesuits for work in Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;R. De Smet, "Foreword," ''Religious Hinduism'', 4th rev. edition, ed. R. De Smet and J. Neuner (Mumbai: St Pauls, 1997) 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian approach to Hinduism==
A pioneer in promoting a new approach to [[Hindu]] Spirituality and Theology which he popularized through his Review ''Light of the East'' he prepared the radical change of outlook towards Eastern non-Christian religions that ultimately found its way into the [[Vatican II]] declaration ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' (on non-Christian Religions).
Inspired by the writings of [[Brahmabandhab Upadhyay]] (1861-1907), Johanns found in [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], the great [[Hindu]] Philosopher of the 9th century, spiritual and theological paths leading to [[Christ]]. Doing so he initiated an '[[inculturation]]' movement of the [[Christian faith]]. His main work was published in 1932-33 : ''Vers le Christ par le [[Vedanta]]'' (2 vol.). Due to ill health he returned to Europe and died in [[Arlon]] ([[Belgium]]) in 1955.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4503">A '''system''' in [[stratigraphy]] is a unit of [[stratum|rock layers]] that were laid down together within the same corresponding [[Period (geology)|geological period]]. The associated period is a [[geochronology|chronological]] time [[Units of measurement|unit]], a part of the [[geological time scale]], while the system is a unit of [[chronostratigraphy]]. Systems are unrelated to [[lithostratigraphy]], which subdivides rock layers on their [[lithology]]. Systems are subdivisions of [[erathem]]s and are themselves divided into [[series (geology)|series]] and [[stage (geology)|stages]].

==Systems in the geological timescale==
The systems of the [[Phanerozoic]] were defined during the 19th century, beginning with the [[Cretaceous]] (by Belgian geologist [[Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy]] in the [[Paris Basin]]) and the [[Carboniferous]] (by British geologists [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] and [[William Phillips (geologist)|William Phillips]]) in 1822). The [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] were divided into the currently used systems before the second half of the 19th century, except for a minor revision when the [[Ordovician]] system was added in 1879.

The [[Cenozoic]] has seen more recent revisions by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]]. It has been divided into three systems with the [[Paleogene]] and [[Neogene]] replacing the former [[Tertiary]] System though the succeeding [[Quaternary]] remains. The one-time system names of [[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]], [[Oligocene]], [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] are now [[series (stratigraphy)|series]] within the Paleogene and Neogene.

Another recent development is the official division of the [[Proterozoic]] into systems, which was decided in 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5658">The '''Tel-musici''' was an early entertainment innovation, which used telephone lines to transmit phonograph recordings to individual households. Subscribers called a central "music room" to request selections, which they listened to at home over specially designed loudspeakers called "magnaphones". The service later incorporated live programs, expanding its operations to more along the lines of a general "[[telephone newspaper]]".

A Tel-musici company was incorporated in Delaware in 1908, and the service began operation in Wilmington the next year. However, although there were plans to expand throughout the United States, only this single location ever became operational, until it ceased operations around 1914.

==History==
[[File:1909 Tel-musici home installation.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Tel-musici service home installation&lt;ref name="distributing"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435063043335;view=1up;seq=707 "Distributing Music Over Telephone Lines"], ''Telephony'', December 18, 1909, pages 699-701.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The primary individual behind the Tel-musici was inventor George R. Webb. In January 1908, while soliciting for investors, he arranged a demonstration of the concept at a Baltimore hotel, where listeners telephoned a remote location with their requests, which were played back as "'10 cents' worth of [[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]],' or 'a quarter's worth of ragtime'" to the assembled participants.&lt;ref&gt;"Melody by 'Phone", ''Baltimore Sun'', January 26, 1908, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, a Tel-musici company with a capitalization of $10,000 was incorporated in the state of Delaware by "a number of Baltimorians".&lt;ref&gt;[https://mtr.arcade-museum.com/MTR-1908-46-5/29/ "Telmusici Co. Incorporated"], ''Music Trade Review'', February 1, 1908, page 29 (arcade-museum.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 an operating Tel-musici system was established in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] with George Webb as the company president, and J. J. Comer the general manager. The music rooms' musical library was described as comprehensive and "embracing a complete line of all the latest productions". The charge was three cents for each requested standard tune, and seven cents for grand opera. Subscribers were required to guarantee purchases totaling $18 per year. Provisions were also made for transmitting a general program in lieu of individual requests.&lt;ref name="distributing" /&gt;

The promoters hoped to interest local telephone companies in installing their own Tel-musici operations. The Wilmington operation was later taken over by the Wilmington and Philadelphia Traction Co., which operated a Wilmington telephone franchise, and an advertisement for a Tel-musici "dance music program" appeared as late as 1914.&lt;ref&gt;"Last and Best April Dance Program" (advertisement), ''Wilmington (Delaware) Morning Star'', April 26, 1914, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it does not appear that any additional installations became operational.

In 1912, George Webb began promoting the similarly conceived Magnaphone system, established in New York City, which was intended to transmit recording and other audio offerings to subscribers for eight dollars a month.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433090817184;view=1up;seq=196 "Something Really New—The Magnaphone"], ''Popular Electricity'', December 1912, pages 808-810.&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Magnaphone and Music Company was granted a twenty-five year franchise for operations "in the Borough of Manhattan and that part of the Borough of The Bronx west of the Bronx River", however, the franchise was never built. J. J. Comer would later participate, in conjunction with the [[Automatic Electric Company]] of Chicago, with development of the [[Musolaphone]] system, which briefly operated in southside Chicago, and which transmitted live news and entertainment to subscribing homes and businesses over telephone lines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435063043525;view=1up;seq=935 "Increasing the Revenue Producing Efficiency of a Plant"] by Stanley R. Edwards, ''Telephony'', October 11, 1913, pages 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''See also [[Titulus (Roman Catholic)]] for Roman churches called tituli, or [[titulus (disambiguation)]] for more meanings.''

'''''Titulus''''' (Latin "inscription" or "label", the plural ''tituli'' is also used in English) is a term used for the labels or captions naming figures or subjects in art, which were commonly added in classical and [[medieval art]], and remain conventional in [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s.  In particular the term describes the conventional inscriptions on stone that listed the honours of an individual&lt;ref&gt;[[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith, William]] (1875). [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Nobiles.html "Nobiles"]. ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''. London. Reprinted by [[The University of Chicago]].&lt;/ref&gt; or that identified boundaries in the [[Roman Empire]].  A [[Titulus pictus]] is a [[merchant's mark]] or other commercial inscription.

The sense of "title", as in "book title", in modern English derives from this artistic sense, just as the [[Title (property)|legal sense]] derives from plainer inscriptions of record.&lt;ref&gt;"Title", ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous titulus was "IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM" inscribed on the placard hanging above [[Jesus]]' head on the [[Cross]]. 

==Use in Western art==
The increasing reluctance of the art of the West to use ''tituli'' was perhaps because so few people could read them in the [[Early Medieval]] period, and later because they reduced the illusionism of the image. Instead a system of [[Emblem|attributes]], objects identifying popular saints, was developed, but many such figures in Western art are now unidentifiable.  This reluctance affected the choice of scenes shown in art; only those [[miracles of Jesus]] that were easily identifiable visually tended to be shown in cycles of the ''[[Life of Christ]]''.  Thus the ''[[Raising of Lazarus]]'' and ''[[Wedding at Cana]]'' are by far the most commonly shown miracles, and the healing miracles, visually easy to confuse, are neglected.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, 152–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mâle, 177&lt;/ref&gt;  The problems can clearly be seen in the small scenes of the [[Saint Augustine Gospels]] (late 6th century), where about 200 years after the manuscript was written ''tituli'' were added, which according to some art historians misidentify some scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Lewine, Carol F.; [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3049296 JSTOR] ''Vulpes Fossa Habent or the Miracle of the Bent Woman in the Gospels of St. Augustine'', Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,&lt;/ref&gt; [[Banderole (speech scroll)|Banderole]]s were a solution that became popular in the later [[Middle Ages]], and in Northern Europe in the 15th century were sometimes used very extensively for speech, rather as in modern comics, as well as ''tituli''.  These were abandoned as old-fashioned in the [[Renaissance]], but increased respect for classical traditions led to continued use of Ancient Roman-style ''tituli'' where they were considered necessary, including on portraits.

==Examples of tituli==
*In the context of the [[Crucifixion]], the ''titulus'' "{{sc2|IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM}}" (and its translations) is believed to have been affixed to Jesus' cross. ''INRI'' is the abbreviation for the above-mentioned Latin translation.  See [[INRI]] and [[Titulus Crucis]].
*At the recovery of the coffin of [[King Arthur]] at [[Glastonbury Abbey]], at an opportune moment after a devastating fire in the 12th century, a lead cross of Arthur was alleged to have borne the explicit ''titulus'' "{{sc2|HIC JACET SEPULTUS INCLITUS REX ARTHURUS IN INSULA AVALONIA}}". The well-publicized discovery described by [[Giraldus Cambrensis]], redoubled the pilgrimages to the Abbey.

In 2011, a total of 130 activists who did arrive at airport were refused entry upon landing, and a few were flown back to their countries' of origin immediately. Four people were granted entry after agreeing to sign documents in which they pledged not to participate in disturbances of the order. The rest of those refused entry were kept in two jails, some for several days, until their expulsions could be arranged.&lt;ref name="haaretz1"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-expels-39-pro-palestinian-activists-over-weekend-holds-81-more-in-jail-1.372693 |title= Israel expels 39 pro-Palestinian activists over weekend, holds 81 more in jail |date= 7 July 2011 |newspaper= Haaretz |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Welcome to Palestine 2011==
Organizers estimated 600 to 1,000 international activists planned to participate, with delegations from France, Great Britain, Sweden, Germany, the USA, Japan and several African countries.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bahour&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/05/welcome-to-palestine-israel |title= Welcome to Palestine – if you can get in |author= Sam Bahour |date= 5 July 2011 |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Olivia Zemor, a French activist said about half the participants were French and ranged in age from 9 to 85.&lt;ref name=Federman/&gt; [[Sam Bahour]], a Palestinian coordinator for the Right to Enter Campaign, said the international activists were invited to participate in the "Welcome to Palestine" initiative by 30 Palestinian civil society organisations.&lt;ref name=Bahour/&gt;

Upon arrival on 8 July in [[Ben Gurion Airport]] in [[Tel Aviv]], the international activists were to openly declare their intent to go to occupied Palestinian territory to Israeli immigration officials.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bahour/&gt; Activists say Israel's prejudicial border policies prompt visitors intending to travel to Palestinian areas to lie about their destination and this initiative aims to draw attention to the right of Palestinians to receive visitors.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bahour/&gt;

Palestinian civil society organisations who make up Welcome to Palestine said they have planned a full itinerary of peaceful activities beginning in [[Bethlehem]] and [[Ramallah]] on 9 July.&lt;ref name=Kershner/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; According to the New York Times, Palestinian organizers include "well-known advocates of non-violent protest like [[Sami Awad]] of the Bethlehem-based Holy Land Trust and [[Mazin Qumsiyeh]], a science professor at [[Bethlehem University]]."&lt;ref name=Kershner/&gt;

===Israel's response===
In the days prior to the launch of the initiative, [[Yitzhak Aharonovitch]], Israel's Internal Security minister, said those intending to participate were "hooligans", and [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], the Prime Minister, said "Every country has the right to deny entrance of provocateurs and trouble-makers into its borders."&lt;ref name=Kershner&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/09/world/middleeast/09mideast.html |title= Israel Blocks Flights to Protest Gathering |author= Isabel Kershner |date= 8 July 2011 |newspaper= The New York Times |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN1/&gt; Israeli officials ordered a heightened security presence at the airport.&lt;ref name=Kershner/&gt; Local media dubbed the initiative a "flightilla", referencing the stymied attempt of the [[Freedom Flotilla II]] to break the [[Gaza blockade]], and disseminated reports that the international visitors would attempt to create chaos at the airport.&lt;ref name=Kershner/&gt; Activists said they were only planning nonviolent activities, and took issue with what they described as a smear campaign launched by Israel against them.&lt;ref name=Federman/&gt;

Israel's Interior Ministry sent a letter with a list of 342 passengers it described as "pro-Palestinian radicals" to foreign airlines notifying them that these people would be refused entry.&lt;ref name=Kershner/&gt; Airlines were asked to prevent these passengers from boarding, and were warned that if they were allowed to fly into Tel Aviv, they would be sent back again on the same aircraft.&lt;ref name=Kershner/&gt; Several airlines did as Israel requested, among them [[Lufthansa]], [[Swiss International Air Lines]] and [[EasyJet]].&lt;ref name=Kershner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swissinfo&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/Flytilla_passengers_grounded_in_Switzerland.html?cid=30643582 |title= &amp;nbsp;'Flytilla' passengers grounded in Switzerland |author= Simon Bradley |date= 8 July 2011 |publisher= [[swissinfo|swissinfo.ch]] |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jet2.com]] canceled tickets to Israel, and according to [[The Guardian]], did not provide a refund, to three Manchester women that had intended on participating in the  "flytilla" protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=265972] Jet2.com airline cancels tickets of pro-Palestine activists&lt;/ref&gt; Donzel Jean Claude, spokesman for Swiss Air said that this issue is regulated by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] and that airlines are "legally obliged" not to board passengers for whom they have information from the destination country that these people will not be allowed to enter. Dr Mark Ellis, executive director of the [[International Bar Association]] said that "every country has the right to say who can and who cannot enter its borders. It's a controversial matter, but not illegal".&lt;ref name = "JaDa 08Jul2011"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/07/201178123322534460.html |title= Israel's no fly zone |author= Jamail Dahr |date= 8 July 2011 |publisher= Al Jazeera English |accessdate=20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4092857,00.html |title= Who's behind the 'flytilla'? |publisher= ynetnews.com |date= 9 July 2011 |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detainees and deportees===
By 9 July, Israeli authorities had questioned hundreds of airline passengers who had arrived at Ben Gurion Airport, and detained 124 people. Four were deported, and the rest, some 76 women and 38 men, were taken to prisons in Beersheba (Ela) and Ramleh (Givon) in Israel, where Israeli officials said they would be held until deported.&lt;ref name=YNET08&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4092909,00.html |title= 50 'flytilla' activists enter West Bank |author= Elior Levy |date= 9 July 2011 |publisher= ynetnews.com |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the detainees are French, but there are also nationals from Belgium, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/8628922/Israel-deports-dozens-of-activists.html |title= Israel deports dozens of activists |author= Richard Spencer |author2=Mark Weiss  |date=10 July 2011 |newspaper= The Sunday Telegraph |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Australians, Vivienne Porzsolt of Jews against the Occupation,&lt;ref name=JAO&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jao.org.au/?page_id=11 |title= Who We Are |publisher= Jews Against the Occupation |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and former parliamentarian Sylvia Hale, who had been participants on the Canadian Boat to Gaza, the ''Tahrir'',&lt;ref name=CBG&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tahrir.ca |title= Delegates on board Tahrir June-July 2011 |publisher= Canadian Boat to Gaza |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Freedom Flotilla II]],&lt;ref name=AmiraHass&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/gaza-bound-from-aborigine-to-palestinian-rights-1.370136 |title= Gaza-bound: from Aborigine to Palestinian rights |author= Amira Hass |date= 29 June 2011 |newspaper= Haaretz |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; flew from Crete to Tel Aviv and were detained but won a precedent-setting court decision allowing them stay in Israel and apply for permission to travel to Palestine.&lt;ref name=Australian&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/israelis-detain-sylvia-hale-ex-nsw-mp-activist/story-fn59niix-1226094159212 |title= Israel releases activists on bail |author= Jodie Minus |author2=John Lyons  |date= 14 July 2011 |newspaper= The Australian |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the British detainees who include four Scots, five English and three Welsh, was the coordinator for the British end of the visit who is also a university teacher and chairman of The Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, as well as four retired professionals between the ages of 66 and 83, an Open University research fellow, the deputy leader of the [[Wales Green Party]] and a founding member of Swansea Palestine Community Link.&lt;ref name=southwales&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/uk_national_news/9131589.12_held_ahead_of_Bethlehem_visit/ |title= 12 held ahead of Bethlehem visit |author= [[Press Association]] |date= 9 July 2011 |newspaper= South Wales Guardian |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jerusalem Post]] reported on 10 July that group of Belgian men being held in Beersheba issued a statement declaring a hunger strike that French and German detainees at the same facility may also have joined.&lt;ref name=Jposthunger&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=228691 |title= 'Flightilla' detainees reportedly begin hunger strike |author= JPost staff |date= 10 July 2012 |newspaper= The Jerusalem Post |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The demands are to be granted contact with their families, attorneys, and one another, and an international investigation into the process that led to their detainment.&lt;ref name=Jposthunger/&gt; As of 11 July, 38 detainees had been deported, leaving 82 still in Israeli custody.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;
  
Six Israeli pro-Palestinian activists who came to the airport to demonstrate their support for the initiative were arrested by Israeli authorities, after, according to the Israeli police spokesman, they "caused a disturbance in the terminal".&lt;ref name=Jaz&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/07/201178154823642194.html |title= Israel clamps down on fly-in protest |publisher= Al Jazeera English |date= 9 July 2011 |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welcome to Palestine representatives in Bethlehem said legal action would be taken to challenge Israel's response.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

==Responses==
According to [[Benyamin Netanyahu]], the flytilla activists were barred because they represented a "provocation [that] was conceived by extremist Islamic and anti-Israel organizations who object to peace and call for Israel's destruction."&lt;ref name = "GoFi 15Apr2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-on-high-alert-ahead-of-flytilla/ |title= Dozens of 'flytilla' activists detained, but mass fly-in thwarted |author= Yoel Goldman |author2= Gabe Fisher |date= 15 April 2012 |newspaper= The Times of Israel |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel had warned airlines to bar ''[[personae non gratae]]'' from flying or face footing the bill for deporting them, fines, and denial of their aircraft to use Israeli airspace.&lt;ref name = "HuNa 17Apr2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "APTI 14Apr2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.timesofisrael.com/european-airlines-cancel-flytilla-tickets/ |title= European airlines cancel 'flytilla' tickets for 100 activists |author= ''Times'' staff |date= 14 April 2012 |agency= Associated Press |newspaper= The Times of Israel |accessdate= 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of people had their flight reservations cancelled by various airlines on 15 April, and an Israeli official said that anyone who managed to evade the Israeli no-fly requests would be apprehended at the Tel Aviv airport and deported.&lt;ref name=YAHOO&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.yahoo.com/airlines-cancel-activists-flights-israel-130155473.html |title= Airlines cancel activists' flights to Israel |author= Daniel Estrin |date= 14 April 2012 |agency= Associated Press |accessdate= 15 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAN 15Apr2012"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/15/207839.html |title= &amp;nbsp;'Welcome to Palestine'?
