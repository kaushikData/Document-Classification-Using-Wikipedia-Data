      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8957">The '''1934 Resettlement Law''' (also known as the '''Law no. 2510''') was a policy adopted on 14 June 1934 by the Turkish government which set forth the basic principles of immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Cagatay, Soner 2002 ‘Kemalist donemde goc ve iskan politikaları: Turk kimligi uzerine bir calısma (Policies of migration and settlement in the Kemalist era: a study on Turkish identity), Toplum ve Bilim, no. 93, pp. 218-41.&lt;/ref&gt;Joost Jongerden has written that the law constituted a policy of forceful assimilation of non-Turkish minorities through a forced and collective resettlement.&lt;ref name=Joost&gt;{{cite book|last=Jongerden|first=Joost|title=The settlement issue in Turkey and the Kurds : an analysis of spatial policies, modernity and war|year=2007|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden, the Netherlands|isbn=9789004155572|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Mehmed fuad köprülü 1966-001.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Mehmet Fuat Köprülü]], key figure in forging a national identity, which inspired the resettlement law]]
The bill was passed by the Turkish National Assembly on 14 June 1934. The law was made public and put into effect after it was published in the ''Resmi Gazete'' a week after its promulgation.&lt;ref name=Joost /&gt; According to the Interior Minister [[Şükrü Kaya]]:&lt;ref&gt;TBMM Zabıt Ceridesi, Devre: IV, Cilt: 23, İçtima: 3, 14/06/1934, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote |This law will create a country speaking with one language, thinking in the same way and sharing the same sentiment.}}

Taking into consideration security and political concerns, the law closed strategic regions of the country to non-Muslim minority settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Icduygu, A., Toktas, S., &amp; Soner, B. A. (2008). The politics of population in a nation-building process: Emigration of non-Muslims from turkey. Ethnic and Racial Studies, 31(2), 358-389. {{doi|10.1080/01419870701491937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish politicians understood that many non-Turks had been resettled on their own into separate villages and therefore had not assimilated into Turkishness.&lt;ref name=Bayrak /&gt; Those individuals who "spoke alien dialects" had been able to differentiate themselves from the Turkish nation. It was a necessity to assess those villages in which such "alien dialects" were spoken and to distribute populations which spoke the "alien dialects" to nearby Turkish villages in order to foster and encourage forced assimilation.&lt;ref name=Bayrak&gt;{{cite book|last=Bayrak|first=Mehmet|title=Kürtler ve ulusal-demokratik mücadeleleri üstüne : gizli belgeler, arastırmalar, notlar|year=1992|publisher=Özge|location=Ankara|isbn=9789757861010|page=508|edition=1. baskı|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Article I of the law, the Minister of Interior was granted the right to govern and redistribute the interior population of the country in accordance with an individual's adherence to Turkish culture.&lt;ref&gt;‘İskan Kanunu’, no: 2510, 14/06/1934, Düstur, Tertip: 3, Cilt: 15, p. 1156.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 11 was a provision regarding that the resettlement must assure 'unity in language, culture and blood'.&lt;ref&gt;1/335 Numaralı İskan Kanunu Layihası ve İskan Muvakkat Encümeni Mazbatası’ In TBMM Zabıt Ceridesi, Devre: IV, Cilt: 3, Ek: 189, 02/05/1932, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement zones were divided in three separate zones according to the adherence of Turkish culture in the each particular individual:&lt;ref&gt;İskan Kanunu’, no: 2510, 14/06/1934, Düstur, Tertip: 3, Cilt: 15, p. 1156.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Zone 1''' - Areas deemed desirable to increase the density of the culturally Turkish population.
*'''Zone 2''' - Areas deemed desirable to establish populations that had to be assimilated into Turkish culture.
*'''Zone 3''' - Areas which had been decided should be evacuated for military, economic, political, or public health reasons, and where resettlement was prohibited.

In paragraph Four of Article 10, the Ministry of Interior was granted the authority to transfer any individual who did not possess a certain degree of "Turkish culture" to Zone 2, where forced assimilatory practices would take place.&lt;ref name=1158-1160&gt;İskan Kanunu’, no: 2510, 14/06/1934, Düstur, Tertip: 3, Cilt: 15, pp. 1158-1160.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Article 12, those individuals who did not speak Turkish and were in Zone 1 and were not transferred Zone 2 must be settled in villages, towns, and districts that had a preexisting dominance of Turkish culture in order to foster assimilation.&lt;ref name=1158-1160 /&gt;

The law also required the resettlement of Muslim minorities such as Circassians, Albanians, and Abkhazes who were considered Muslims who had failed to fully adhere to the Turkish nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gülalp|first=Haldun|title=Citizenship and Ethnic Conflict: Challenging the nation-state|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134203819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these minorities shared the same faith as their Turkish counterparts, it was still considered a goal by the politicians of the Turkish Republic to bind all peoples of Turkey to become Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;TBMM Zabit Ceridesi, Session IV, vol. 23, addenda 189, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thracian events==
[[File:Yusuf Ziya Zarbun.jpg|thumb|165px|right|Yusuf Ziya Zarbun, far-right politician, who supported the resettlement law]]
Although the Law on Settlement was expected to operate as an instrument for [[Turkification|Turkifying]] the mass of non-Turkish speaking citizens, it immediately emerged as a piece of legislation which sparked riots by non-Muslims, as evidenced in the [[1934 Thrace pogroms]] in the immediate aftermath of the law's passage. Law No. 2510 was issued on 14 June 1934, and the Thrace pogroms began just over a fortnight later, on 3 July. The incidents seeking to force out the region's non-Muslim residents first began in [[Çanakkale]], where [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Jews]] received unsigned letters telling them to leave the city, and then escalated into an [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] campaign involving economic boycotts and verbal assaults as well as physical violence against the Jews living in the various provinces of Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Avner. 1998. Turkiye Cumhuriyetinde Yahudiler (Jews in the Republic of Turkey), Istanbul: Iletisim Yayınları&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that out of a total 15,000-20,000 Jews living in the region, more than half fled to Istanbul during and after the incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Karabatak, Haluk 1996 ‘Turkiye azınlık tarihine bir katkı: 1934 Trakya olayları ve Yahudiler’ (A contribution to the history of minorities in Turkey: the 1934 Thracian affair and the Jews), Tarih ve Toplum, vol. 146, pp. 68-80.&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the Law on Settlement may well have actually provoked the incidents’ outbreak, the national authorities did not side with the attackers but immediately intervened in the incidents. After order was restored, the governors and mayors of the provinces involved were removed from office.&lt;ref&gt;Toprak, Zafer. 1996 ‘1934 Trakya olaylarında hukumetin ve CHP’in sorumlulugu (Government responsibility and the RPP in the 1934 Thracian incidents), Toplumsal Tarih, vol. 34, pp. 19-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dersim Rebellion==
{{main|Dersim rebellion}}
The law played a major role in the events in Dersim in 1938 known as the [[Dersim rebellion]]. Forced resettlement was used in the depopulation of [[Tunceli Province|Dersim]] in Eastern Turkey in 1937-1938, where, according to McDowall, 40,000 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;David McDowall, A modern history of the Kurds, I. B. Tauris, 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-85043-416-0}}, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; In seventeen days of the 1938 offensive alone, 7,954 persons were reported killed or caught alive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Suppression of the Dersim Rebellion in Turkey (1937-38)''; p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; According to official Turkish reports, almost 10 percent of the entire population of Tunceli was killed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Kurds claim that their losses were even higher.

The 1934 Turkish Resettlement Law was the legal justification used for the forced resettlement. It was used primarily to target the region of Dersim as one of its first test cases, which left disastrous consequences for the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George J.

==Biography==
The violent political turbulence of Argentina in the 1970s led Ana Baron to settle in Paris, where she graduated from the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences]] and the [[Sciences Po|Fondation National Sciences Politiques]].&lt;ref name=lucidez/&gt; In those years she became a correspondent of [[Editorial Atlántida]], together with her colleagues Danielle Raymond and Silvina Lanús.&lt;ref name=incansable&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/ana-baron-periodista-incansable-talento_0_By_kSVtw7g.html |title=Ana Baron, una periodista incansable que fue puro talento |trans-title=Ana Baron, a Tireless Journalist Who was Pure Talent |work=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] |language=Spanish |date=21 August 2015 |access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1985 she resided in the United States. Her colleagues recalled an anecdote from 1986:

{{Quote|When [[José López Rega]] was arrested in Miami, a group of Argentines went to the jail to try to interview him. That monster did not want to give interviews and journalists were invited to leave the area, accompanied by an artillery jeep. A few kilometers away, those on television turned on their cameras for other colleagues to give testimony. Ana, with her voice that sometimes knew stridency, proclaimed: "Oh, no. When journalists interview journalists, it's time to go home." She got into her car and they did not see her anymore.&lt;ref name=incansable/&gt;}}

In the 1990s she joined the already created Journalists' Association of Argentina, of which she was a member until November 2004, when she was part of the collective that resigned before its imminent dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.diariosobrediarios.com.ar/dsd/notas/4/209-se-disolvio-la-asociacion-periodistas.php#.VddRSbKqqko |title=Se disolvió la Asociación Periodistas |trans-title=The Journalists' Association Dissolves |work=Diario Sobre Diarios |language=Spanish |date=12 November 2004 |access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998 to 2013 she was the Washington, D.C. correspondent of the Buenos Aires newspaper ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', for which she had been a columnist in preceding years from New York.

In 1999 she was part of the group {{ill|King of Spain International Journalism Prizes|es|Premios Internacionales de Periodismo Rey de España|lt=awarded}} by [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]] for an investigation in the ''Clarín'' supplement ''Zona''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edant.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/1998/11/01/i-00801e.htm |title=Anatomía de un golpe |trans-title=Anatomy of a Coup |first1=Alberto |last1=Amato |first2=Maria |last2=Seoane |first3=Vicente |last3=Muleiro |work=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] Zona |language=Spanish |date=1 November 1998 |access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the secret reports of the US Embassy.&lt;ref name=Infobae/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2015/08/21/argentina-ana-baron-king-spain-journalism-prize-winner-dies/ |title=Argentina's Ana Baron, King of Spain Journalism Prize winner, dies |publisher=[[Fox News Latino]] |agency=EFE |date=21 August 2015 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150823164310/http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2015/08/21/argentina-ana-baron-king-spain-journalism-prize-winner-dies/ |archive-date=2015-08-23 |dead-url=yes |access-date=6 August 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BIX''' (Building Industry Cross-connect) is part of a [[telephony]] cross-connect system (Integrated Building Distribution Network - IBDN) created in the 1970s by [[Nortel Networks]]. As a system, it consists of various sizes of [[Punch block|punch-down blocks]], cable distribution accessories (such as moulded rings and strips), and a punch-down tool to terminate wires at the punch-down block. The BIX cross-connect system as a whole is certified for Category-5e. The BIX cross-connect system is primarily composed of two parts: the mounts, and the connectors.

==Mounts==

BIX mounts are wall-mounted frames, generally built from 16 gauge steel. The frames feature a rectangular plastic backplate, and two plastic brackets that extend from either side of the backplate to fit between two and ten BIX connectors. The connectors are oriented horizontally on the mount. The BIX mounts are referred to as either '12E','10A' or '10C'. The 12E frames will mount up to 12 connectors; The 10A frames will mount up to 10 connectors; the 10C frames will mount 2 connectors.

==Connectors==

BIX connectors are rectangular punch-down blocks used to terminate up to 25 pairs. The connecters have a slip-in fitting which automatically strips the wire as it is punched down, eliminating the need for pre-stripping. BIX connectors also have a pair-splitter to facilitate fast arranging of wires on the punch-down block.

There are many types of BIX connectors, the most popular kinds being the 1A and the 1A4.

1A: Distribution connector, 5-pair markings&lt;ref name="BIX Blocks Accessories"&gt;http://www.trynci.com/cat/telco30.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

1A4: Distribution connector, 4-pair markings&lt;ref name="BIX Blocks Accessories"&gt;http://www.trynci.com/cat/telco30.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

2A: Bridging connector, 12 2-pair clips&lt;ref name="BIX Blocks Accessories"&gt;http://www.trynci.com/cat/telco30.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

5A: Multiplying connector, 5-pair markings&lt;ref name="BIX Blocks Accessories"&gt;http://www.trynci.com/cat/telco30.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

7A: Key apparatus connector&lt;ref name="BIX Blocks Accessories"&gt;http://www.trynci.com/cat/telco30.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

9A: Diode connector, 24 diodes&lt;ref name="BIX Blocks Accessories"&gt;http://www.trynci.com/cat/telco30.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

36B, 36C, 36D: Modular RJ-11 jack connector&lt;ref name="BIX Blocks Accessories"&gt;http://www.trynci.com/cat/telco30.htm&lt;/ref&gt;


==GigaBIX==

NORDX/CDT{{huh|date=November 2011}} developed the GigaBIX [[Insulation-displacement_connector|IDC]]–based system with a transmission performance that
goes beyond the [[Category 6 cable|Category-6]] standard and is available in two topologies: the Patch Cord topology and the Cross-Connect Wire topology. It is based on the mature BIX technology, which is over 25 years old and well-established in the telecommunications industry. The termination and installation procedures have been improved, allowing the quality of the system to surpass Category-6. The system guarantees channel bandwidths up to 300&amp;nbsp;MHz, and can transmit data up to 4.8 Gbit/s.&lt;ref name="bix-evolved1"&gt;{{cite web | title=GigaBIX | work=ITWorldCanada website | url=http://www.itworldcanada.com/a/Network-World/9e696b26-16de-425f-92b9-ab25bd8d0706.html | accessdate=2007-12-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071231115552/http://www.itworldcanada.com/a/Network-World/9e696b26-16de-425f-92b9-ab25bd8d0706.html| archivedate= 31 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GigaBIX system is primarily made up of mounts and connectors. The Patch Cord topology utilizes GigaBIX PS6+ patch cords which are 4 pair 23-AWG UTP cords with a channel bandwidth of 250&amp;nbsp;MHz or 300&amp;nbsp;MHz, depending on how they are employed. These patch cords are typically used with the  and the Cross-Connect topology utilizes GigaBIX cross-connect wire.{{clarification needed|date=August 2015}} Both topologies utilize the same mounts, connectors, distribution frames, and other accessories (such as designation strips, wire guards, covers, distribution rings, and many other accessories).

==History==

Since the 1970s, Northern Telecom (Nortel), who designed the BIX system, had been manufacturing BIX mounts, connectors and tools in house. Northern Telecom's manufacturing division was called Nortel Cable Group. In February 1996, Nortel Cable Group was sold to Cable Design Technologies Corporation and was renamed to NORDX/CDT.&lt;ref name="nordx-cdt"&gt;{{cite web | title=NORDX/CDT, Our First 100 Years | work=Belden CDT Networking (NORDX) website | url=http://www.nordx.com/public/htmen/1_1.htm | accessdate=2006-03-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060320115621/http://www.nordx.com/public/htmen/1_1.htm| archivedate= 20 March 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NORDX/CDT subsequently merged with Belden Inc in July 2004, becoming Belden CDT Inc.&lt;ref name="belden-cdt"&gt;{{cite web | title=Company History | work=Belden CDT Inc. website | url=http://investor.belden.com/history.cfm | accessdate=2006-03-30 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321180327/http://investor.belden.com/history.cfm | archivedate=2006-03-21 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2007, Belden CDT officially changed its name to [[Belden (electronics company)|Belden]].&lt;ref name="belden-inc"&gt;{{cite web | title=Belden Investor Relations | work=Belden Inc.

Belden now sells all BIX products including mounts, connectors, tools and accessories previously sold by NORDX/CDT, and before that, Nortel Cable Group.

{{Other uses|Blacklist (disambiguation)}}{{Selfref|See also; [[Wikipedia:Spam blacklist]], [[Wikipedia:Image blacklist]].}}

'''Blacklisting''' is the action of a group or authority,    compiling a '''blacklist''' (or '''black list''') of people, countries or other entities to be avoided or distrusted as not being acceptable to those making the list.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=blacklist Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary | website=Cambridge Dictionary | date=1 March 2017 | url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/blacklist | accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A blacklist can list people to be discriminated against, refused employment, or censored. As a [[verb]], blacklist can mean to put an individual or entity on such a list.&lt;ref name="Collins English Dictionary 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Blacklist definition and meaning | website=Collins English Dictionary | date=7 March 2017 | url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/blacklist | accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the term ==
The English dramatist [[Philip Massinger]] used the phrase "black list" in his 1639 tragedy ''The Unnatural Combat''.&lt;ref name="Chadjtlington2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Chadlington|title=The Real McCoy: Understanding Peculiar English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzEjAQAAIAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Icon|isbn=978-1-84046-684-3|p=43}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Massinger|title=Dramatic Works: A new way to pay old debts.

Davies|page=194|quotation=Might write me down in the black List of those That have nor Fire, nor Spirit of their own}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the English monarchy]] brought [[Charles II of England]] to the throne in 1660, a [[List of regicides of Charles I|list of regicides]] named those to be punished for the execution of [[Charles I of England|his father]].&lt;ref name="McFedries2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul McFedries|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Weird Word Origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-macyDTIfaMC&amp;pg=PA14|date=August 5, 2008|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=978-1-101-21718-4|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state papers of Charles II say "If any innocent soul be found in this black list, let him not be offended at me, but consider whether some mistaken principle or interest may not have misled him to vote".&lt;ref name="Office1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain. Public Record Office|title=Calendar of state papers, domestic series, of the reign of Charles II: preserved in the state paper department of Her Majesty's Public Record Office|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPNVAAAAYAAJ|year=1968|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman &amp; Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a 1676 history of the events leading up to the Restoration, [[James Heath (historian)|James Heath]] (a supporter of Charles II) alleged that Parliament had passed an Act requiring the sale of estates, "And into this black list the [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] was now put, and other unfortunate Royalists".&lt;ref name="HeathPhillips1676"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Heath|author2=John Phillips|title=A Chronicle of the Late Intestine War in the Three Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland: With the Intervening Affairs of Treaties, and Other Occurrences Relating Thereunto.

[[Edward Gibbon]] wrote in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) of [[Andronikos I Komnenos|Andronicus]] that "His memory was stored with a black list of the enemies and rivals, who had traduced his merit, opposed his greatness, or insulted his misfortunes".&lt;ref name="Gibbon 2005"&gt;{{cite web | last=Gibbon | first=Edward | title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. 8 | website=Online Library of Liberty | date=18 July 2005 | url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/gibbon-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-8?q=black+list#Gibbon_0214-08_148 | accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment context ==
{{Main|Blacklist (employment)}}

The first published reference to blacklisting of an employee dates from 1774. This became a significant employment issue in American mining towns and [[company town]]s, where blacklisting could mean a complete loss of livelihood for workers who went on strike.&lt;ref name="Weir2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E. Weir|title=Workers in America: A Historical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Feb0w1622soC&amp;pg=PA71|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-718-5|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1901 Report of the [[Industrial Commission]] stated "There was no doubt in the minds of workingmen of the existence of the blacklisting system, though it was practically impossible to obtain evidence of it." It cited a news report that in 1895 a former conductor on the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] committed suicide, having been out of work ever since a strike: "Wherever he went the blacklist was ahead of him".&lt;ref name="CommissionMeyer1901"&gt;{{cite book|author1=United States Industrial Commission|author2=Balthasar Henry Meyer|author3=Roswell Cheney McCrea|title=Report of the Industrial Commission on Transportation, including testimony, review and topical digest of evidence, and special reports on railway legislation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3ZMAAAAMAAJ|year=1901|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 outlawed punitive blacklists against employees who supported [[trade union]]s or criticised their employers, the practice continued in common use. The [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947|Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947 made amendments which sustained blacklisting by affirming the right of employers to be anti-union, and by requiring trade union leaders to make loyalty oaths which had the same effect as the [[Hollywood blacklist]]. Since then, lawsuits for unfair dismissal have led to blacklisting being covert or informal, but it remains common.&lt;ref name="Weir2013" /&gt;

== World Wars I and II ==
During [[World War I]], the British government adopted a "blacklist" based on an Order in Council of 23 December 1915, prohibiting British subjects from trade with specified firms and individuals in neutral countries; the lists were published in the ''[[The London Gazette|London Gazette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:The Encyclopedia Americana (1920)/Blacklist, The|The Encyclopedia Americana (1920), Blacklist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1940, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] printed a secret list called ''Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.'' ("Special Search List Great Britain") as part of [[Nazi Germany]]'s preparations for invasion codenamed [[Operation Sea Lion]] – when this booklet was found after the war, it was commonly called the [[The Black Book|Black Book]] and described as a blacklist.&lt;ref name="GoodenLewis2014"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Philip Gooden |author2 = Peter Lewis |title = The Word at War: World War Two in 100 Phrases |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TwlpBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22 |date = September 25, 2014 |publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing |ISBN = 978-1-4729-0490-4 |page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hollywood anti-communist blacklist ==
{{Main|Hollywood blacklist}}
The [[Hollywood blacklist]] was instituted by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] in 1947 to block screenwriters and other Hollywood professionals who were purported to have Communist sympathies from obtaining employment. It started by listing 151 entertainment industry professionals and lasted until 1960 when it was effectively broken by the acknowledgement that blacklisted professionals had been working under assumed names for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wilkerson |first=William |author-link=William Wilkerson |publication-date=1946-07-29 |title=A Vote For Joe Stalin |periodical=The Hollywood Reporter |page=1 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baum"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blacklist-thr-addresses-role-65-391931|title=Blacklist: THR Addresses Role After 65 Years|last=Baum|first=Gary|author2=Daniel Miller|date=November 19, 2012|work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical context ==
{{See also|Patient abuse}}
Blacklisting by multiple providers is a systematic act by doctors to deny care to a certain [[patient]] or patients. It is done in various ways for various reasons; blacklisting is not new. In 1907 the Transvaal Medical Union in South Africa blacklisted patients if they could not pay cash in advance.&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Cape Doctor in the Nineteenth Century: A Social History (Clio Medica, 74) | editor-first=Harriet |editor-last=Deacon | editor2-first=Howard | editor2-last= Phillips | editor3-first=Elizabeth | editor3-last=van Heyningen | publisher = Editions Rodipi B.V. | year = 2004 | url= https://www.amazon.com/The-Cape-Doctor-Nineteenth-Century/dp/9042010649}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, there was a physical list kept by the community of [[physician]]s. A physical list is not necessary to blacklist patients but the effect is the same.

The [[United States Department of Health &amp; Human Services]] (HHS) found that reviewed hospitals did not generate incident reports for 93% of adverse events. The 7% of the time when they did generate reports, the information was inaccurate 63% of the time. Problems causing harm to patients were reported accurately only 2% &lt;ref&gt;2% ~ 7% * [100% - 63%]&lt;/ref&gt; of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-08-00221.pdf |title=Adverse events in hospitals: Methods for identifying events |last1=Ashcraft |first1=Amy |last2=Dorrill |first2=Ruth Ann |date=March 2010 |website=oig.hhs.gov |publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]] |access-date=March 26, 2016  |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If blacklisting is multiple providers systematically denying care to a certain [[patient]] or patients, in this case patients with [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] injuries, it is reasonable to define it as blacklisting when 98% &lt;ref&gt;98% ~ 93% + [7% * 63%]&lt;/ref&gt; of the time the first group, treatment providers, singles out members of the second group, injured patients, to prevent them from having an accurate record made of what injured them. Those patients are further injured by not having the accurate record necessary for getting care for the injuries.

== Fraud control ==

=== Credit card merchant accounts ===
Companies which have a [[payment card]] [[merchant account]] terminated, and their directors, are often added to a list referred to when companies apply for an account; they are then unlikely to be granted a new account by any provider. In the US the list is called TMF/MATCH.

A '''boxout''' is an approximately [[Square (geometry)|square]]-shaped design element that contains text or graphics separate from the [[Column (typography)|main body]] of text or graphics on the page. Unlike a [[Sidebar (publishing)|sidebar]], a boxout does not need to be a vertical [[rectangle]] along one edge of the page.

Boxouts are very commonly used in magazines, but may also be seen in books and on web pages. The function of a boxout is primarily to hold related information separate from the main essay while retaining some degree of connection. As such, boxouts will often be seen containing things like [[glossary|glossaries]] and author [[biographies]]. On web pages they frequently contain [[hyperlink]]s to related articles. In terms of design, boxouts help to break up the page and make it more visually interesting.

'''Bulgarian Sign Language''' (in [[Bulgarian_language|Bulgarian]]: "български жестомимичен език (БЖЕ)") is the language, or perhaps languages, of the [[deaf]] community in [[Bulgaria]]. 

Primary schools were established for the deaf. [[Russian Sign Language]] was introduced in 1910, and allowed in the classroom in 1945, and Wittmann (1991) classifies it as a descendent of Russian Sign.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann, Henri]] (1991).  "Classification linguistique des langues signées non vocalement." Revue québécoise de linguistique théorique et appliquée 10:1.215–88.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1991a-class.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bickford (2005) found that Bulgarian Sign formed a cluster with Slovak, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, and Polish Sign.&lt;ref&gt;Bickford, 2005. [http://www.sil.org/silesr/2005/silesr2005-026.pdf ''The Signed Languages of Eastern Europe'']&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the classroom is different from that used by adults outside,&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; and it is not clear if Wittmann and Bickford looked at the same language; nor, if one is derived from Russian Sign, if it is a dialect or if it creolized to form a new language.

'''Bulk mail''' broadly refers to [[mail]] that is mailed and processed in bulk at reduced rates.  The term does not [[denotation|denote]] any particular purpose for the mail, but is sometimes used (incorrectly) as a synonym for "junk mail".

For example, the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) defines bulk mail broadly as "quantities of mail prepared for mailing at reduced postage rates."  The preparation includes presorting and placing into containers by [[ZIP code]].  The containers, along with a manifest, are taken to an area in a [[post office]] called a bulk-mail-entry unit.  The presorting and the use of containers allow highly automated mail processing, both in bulk and piecewise, in processing facilities called '''bulk mail centers''' (BMCs).

In 2009, the USPS announced plans to streamline sorting and delivery, which would recast the BMCs as "[[Network Distribution Center]]s".&lt;ref&gt;[http://parcelindustry.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=23C6283BD51B46348B616C079EEB2E21&amp;nm=Miscellaneous&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications::Article&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=594390D32C4C40F988FAD341592D70E5 Postal Service to Revamp Bulk Mail Center Network] Parcel, February 25 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postalreporternews.net/2009/02/26/changes-in-store-for-postal-bulk-mail-center-network/ Changes In Store For Postal Bulk Mail Center Network] PostalReporter News Blog, February 26 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Junk mail==
{{main|Advertising mail}}
Although bulk mail, junk mail, and admail are, strictly speaking, not synonymous, the terms are used in common parlance to refer to unsolicited invitations delivered by mail (typically, but not invariably, at bulk rates) to homes and businesses.

'''Cláudio Manuel da Costa''' (June 4, 1729 – July 4, 1789) was a Brazilian poet and musician, considered to be the introducer of [[Neoclassicism]] in Brazil. He wrote under the pen name '''Glauceste Satúrnio''', and his most famous work is the [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''Vila Rica'', that tells the history of the homonymous city, nowadays called [[Ouro Preto]].

He is the patron of the 8th chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

==Biography==
Cláudio Manuel da Costa was born in the city of Vargem do Itacolomi (nowadays [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]]), to Portuguese João Gonçalves da Costa and Brazilian Teresa Ribeiro de Alvarenga. In 1749, he went to [[Lisbon]], where he was graduated in [[Canon law]] in the [[University of Coimbra]], where he composed most of his poems. Returning to Brazil, to the city of [[Ouro Preto]], in 1754, he became a lawyer and a goldsmith.

He was the secretary of Minas Gerais from 1762 to 1765, and a judge of lands from 1769 to 1773. He founded in Ouro Preto a Neoclassic literary academy called "Colônia Ultramarina" ("Ultramarine Colony") in 1768, where he wrote many of his poems and performed the theatre play ''O Parnaso Obsequioso''.

During the 1770s and the 1780s, he became friends with [[Tomás António Gonzaga]], who exercised a great influence in Cláudio's work. According to studies made in the mid-20th century, the preface of Gonzaga's ''[[Cartas Chilenas]]'' (''Chilean Letters'') was written by Costa.

Along with Gonzaga and others, Cláudio was a member of the unsuccessful 1789 [[Inconfidência Mineira|Minas Conspiracy]]. Arrested, he was killed in prison on July 4, 1789.

==Works==
* ''Munúsculo Métrico'' (1751)
* ''Epicédio em Memória de Frei Gaspar da Encarnação'' (1753)
* ''Labirinto de Amor'' (1753)
* ''Obras Poéticas de Glauceste Satúrnio'' (1768 — reimpressed in 1903)
* ''Vila Rica'' (1773 — published in 1839)

==Representations in popular culture==
Costa was portrayed by [[Emiliano Queiroz]] in the [[1999 in film|1999]] film ''[[Tiradentes (film)|Tiradentes]]'', by [[Fernando Torres]] in the [[1972 in film|1972]] film ''[[Os Inconfidentes]]'' and in the [[1969 in television|1969]] [[telenovela]] ''[[Dez Vidas]]'', and by [[Carlos Vereza]] in the [[2003 in film|2003]] film ''[[Aleijadinho: Paixão, Glória e Suplício]]''.

The '''dash''' is a [[punctuation]] mark that is similar in appearance to {{unichar|002D|HYPHEN-MINUS|nlink=hyphen-minus}} and {{unichar|2212|MINUS SIGN|nlink=Plus and minus signs#Minus sign}}, but differs from these symbols in both length and height. The most common versions of the dash are the [[En (typography)|en]] dash (–), equal to half the height of the font; the [[Em (typography)|em]] dash (—), twice as long as the en dash; and the [[#Horizontal bar|horizontal bar]] (―), whose length varies across typefaces.{{efn|In [[Cambria]] and many other fonts, the length of the horizontal bar is equal to ¾ em dash or 1½ en dash.}}

Historically, the names of en dash and em dash were loosely related to the width of a lower-case ''n'' and upper-case ''M'', respectively, in commonly used [[typeface]]s.

Usage varies both within English and in other languages, but the usual convention in printed English text is as follows:
* '''An em dash''' denotes a break in a sentence or to set off parenthetical statements:&lt;ref&gt;''[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/dash-and-em-dash English Oxford Living Dictionary]'' (2018) Oxford University Press. Accessed 15 August, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Glitter, felt, yarn, and buttons—his kitchen looked as if a clown had exploded.&lt;br /&gt;A flock of sparrows—some of them juveniles—alighted and sang.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* '''The en dash but not the em dash''' indicates spans or differentiation, where it may be considered to replace "and" or "to" (but not "to" in the phrase "from … to …"):&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.mhra.org.uk/Publications/Books/StyleGuide/index.html MHRA Style Guide: A Handbook for Authors, Editors, and Writers of Theses]'', 2nd ed, p. 26. Modern Humanities Research Association (London). Accessed 3 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was fought in western Pennsylvania and along the present US–Canada border (Edwards, pp. 81–101).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* '''The em dash or the horizontal bar, but not the en dash''' is used to set off the sources of quotes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Seven social sins: politics without principles, wealth without work, pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, commerce without morality, science without humanity, and worship without sacrifice.—Mahatma Gandhi&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* '''The horizontal bar (or the em dash, but not the en dash)''' introduces quoted text at line start.{{efn|In the Unicode Standard, the horizontal bar is also called "quotation dash" (see [https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2000.pdf General punctuation]).}}

== Figure dash ==
The '''figure dash''' (‒) is so named because it is the same width as a digit, at least in [[font]]s with digits of equal width. This is true of most fonts, not only monospaced fonts.

The figure dash is used within numbers (e.g. phone number 555‒0199), especially in columns for maintaining alignment.

The figure dash is often unavailable; in this case, one may use a [[hyphen-minus]] instead. In [[Unicode]], the figure dash is {{U+|2012}} (decimal 8210). HTML authors must use the numeric forms &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8210;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x2012;&lt;/code&gt; to type it unless the file is in Unicode; there is no equivalent character entity.

In [[TeX]], the standard fonts have no figure dash; however, the digits normally all have the same width as the en dash, so an en dash can be substituted when using standard TeX fonts. In [[XeLaTeX]], one could use &lt;code&gt;\char"2012 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://b-p-i.blogspot.ro/2011/08/figure-dash-in-xelatex.html figure dash in XeLaTeX]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Linux Libertine]] font has the figure dash glyph).

== En dash ==
The '''en dash''', '''en rule''', or '''nut''' ('''&amp;ndash;''') is traditionally half the width of an [[#Em dash|em dash]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Usage ===
The two main uses of the en dash are to connect symmetric items, such as the two ends of a range or two competitors or alternatives, and as a substitute for a hyphen in a compound when one of the connected items is more complex than a single word.

==== Ranges of values ====
The en dash is commonly used to indicate a closed range of values—a range with clearly defined and finite upper and lower boundaries—roughly signifying what might otherwise be communicated by the word "through".&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, David. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20131103150905/http://www.academicwritingtutor.com/hyphens-en-dashes-and-em-dashes-correct-usage/ Hyphens, En Dashes, and Em Dashes: Correct Usage]". Academic Writing Tutor. Retrieved 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This may include ranges such as those between dates, times, or numbers.&lt;ref name = "barronsgrammar"&gt;{{cite book |last = Griffith |first = Benjamin W |title = Pocket Guide to Correct Grammar |series = Barron's Pocket Guides |publisher = Barron's Educational Series |location = Woodbury, NY |year = 2004 |ISBN = 0-7641-2690-3 |display-authors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="copyeditguide"&gt;{{cite book |last = Judd |first = Karen |title = Copyediting: A Practical Guide |publisher = Crisp Publications | location = Menlo Park, CA |year = 2001 |ISBN = 1-56052-608-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webstersgrammar"&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Gordon |last1 = Loberger |first2 = Kate Shoup |last2 = Welsh |title = Webster's new world English grammar handbook |publisher = Hungry Minds |location = New York, NY |year = 2001 |ISBN = 0-7645-6488-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="texttypestyle"&gt;{{cite book

Preference for hyphen vs. en dash in ranges varies.  For example, the [[APA style]] (named after the  American Psychological Association) uses an en dash in ranges, but the [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]] (named after the American Medical Association) uses a hyphen:

|-
|}

Various style guides (including the ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units ([[SI]])'' and the ''[[AMA Manual of Style]]'') recommend that when a number range might be misconstrued as subtraction, the word "'''''to'''''" should be used instead of an en dash. For example, "a voltage of 50&amp;nbsp;V to 100&amp;nbsp;V" is preferable to using "a voltage of 50–100&amp;nbsp;V". Relatedly, in ranges that include negative numbers, "to" is used to avoid ambiguity or awkwardness (for example, "temperatures ranged from −18&amp;thinsp;°C to −34&amp;thinsp;°C", or alternately, −18&amp;thinsp;°C...−34&amp;thinsp;°C). It is also considered poor style (best avoided) to use the en dash in place of the words ''to'' or ''and'' in phrases that follow the forms ''from&amp;nbsp;X to&amp;nbsp;Y'' and ''between&amp;nbsp;X and&amp;nbsp;Y''.&lt;ref name="copyeditguide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="webstersgrammar" /&gt;

==== Relationships and connections ====
The en dash can also be used to contrast values, or illustrate a relationship between two things.&lt;ref name="barronsgrammar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="texttypestyle" /&gt; Examples of this usage include:
* Australia beat American Samoa [[Australia 31–0 American Samoa|31–0]].
* Radical–Unionist coalition
* Boston–Hartford route
* New York–London flight (however, it may be seen that ''New York to London flight'' is more appropriate because New York is a single name composed of two valid words; with a dash the phrase is ambiguous and could mean either ''Flight from New York to London'' or ''New flight from York to London'')&lt;ref name="texttypestyle" /&gt;
* Mother–daughter relationship
* The Supreme Court voted 5–4 to uphold the decision.
* The [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|McCain–Feingold bill]]

Among writers who use en dashes in these contexts, a distinction is often made between "simple" attributive compounds (written with a hyphen) and other subtypes (written with an en dash); at least one authority considers name pairs, where the paired elements carry equal weight, as in the [[Taft–Hartley Act]] to be "simple",&lt;ref name="copyeditguide" /&gt; while others consider an en dash appropriate in instances such as these&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Garner |first=Bryan A. |author-link = Bryan A.

However, there is a difference between something named for a parallel/coordinate relationship between two people (for example, [[Satyendra Nath Bose|Bose]] and [[Einstein]]) and something named for a single person who had a [[compound surname]], which may be written with a hyphen or a space but not an en dash (for example, the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] [hyphen] is named after one person (Mr. [[John Lennard-Jones]]), as are [[Bence Jones protein]]s and [[John Hughlings Jackson|Hughlings Jackson syndrome]] [space]). Copyeditors use dictionaries (general, medical, biographical, and geographical) to confirm the [[eponym]]ity (and thus the styling) for specific terms, given that no one can know them all offhand.

The preference for an en dash instead of a hyphen in these coordinate/relationship/connection types of terms is a matter of style preference, not inherent orthographic "correctness"; both are equally "correct", and each is the preferred style in some style guides. For example, the ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', the ''[[AMA Manual of Style]]'', and [[Dorland's medical reference works]] use hyphens, not en dashes, in coordinate terms (such as ''[[blood–brain barrier]]''), in [[eponym]]s (such as ''[[Cheyne–Stokes respiration]]'', ''[[Kaplan–Meier method]]''), and so on.

==== Attributive compounds ====
In English, the en dash is usually used instead of a [[hyphen]] in [[Adjectival phrase|compound (phrasal) attributives]] in which one or both elements is itself a compound, especially when the compound element is an [[wikt:open compound|open compound]], meaning it is not itself hyphenated. This manner of usage may include such examples as:&lt;ref name="copyeditguide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="webstersgrammar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Company2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=The American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style |url = https://books.google.com/?id=xb6ie6PqYhwC&amp;pg=PA129 |year = 2005 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=978-0-618-60499-9 |page = 129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LutzStevenson2005"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gary |last1=Lutz |first2=Diane |last2=Stevenson |title=The Writer's Digest Grammar Desk Reference |url = https://books.google.com/?id=SsQ9ugnMcpUC&amp;pg=PA296 |via=Google Books|date=2005 |publisher=Writer's Digest Books |isbn=978-1-58297-335-7 |page = 296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The hospital–nursing home connection (the connection between the ''hospital'' and the ''nursing home'', not a ''home connection'' between the ''hospital'' and ''nursing'')
* A nursing home–home care policy (a policy about the ''nursing home'' and ''home care'')
* Pre–Civil War era
* [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]]–winning novel
* The non–San Francisco part of the world
* The post–World War II era
** (Compare ''[[post-war]] era'', which, if not fully compounded (''postwar''), takes a hyphen, not an en dash. The difference is that ''war'' is not an open compound whereas ''World War II'' is.)
* [[Trans–New Guinea languages]]
* The ex–prime minister
* a long–focal length camera
* water ice–based bedrock
* The pro-conscription–anti-conscription debate
* Public-school–private-school rivalries

The disambiguating value of the en dash in these patterns was illustrated by Strunk and White in ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' with the following example: When ''Chattanooga News'' and ''Chattanooga Free Press'' merged, the joint company was inaptly named ''[[Chattanooga News-Free Press]]'' (using a hyphen), which could be interpreted as meaning that their newspapers were news-free.&lt;ref name="Einsohn2000" /&gt;

An exception to the use of en dashes is usually made when [[prefix]]ing an already-[[wikt:hyphenated compound|hyphenated compound]]; an en dash is generally avoided as a distraction in this case. Examples of this include:&lt;ref name="Einsohn2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=Amy |last=Einsohn |title=The Copyeditor's Handbook: A Guide for Book Publishing and Corporate Communications, with Exercises and Answer Keys |url= https://books.google.com/?id=93i4WNp9ZtYC&amp;pg=PA108 |date=2000 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-21834-5 |pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* non-English-speaking air traffic controllers
* semi-labor-intensive industries
* [[Proto-Indo-European language]]
* The post-[[MS-DOS]] era
* non-government-owned corporations

An en dash can be retained to avoid ambiguity, but whether any ambiguity is plausible is a judgment call. [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]] retains the en dashes in the following examples:&lt;ref name="AMA10_8.3.1"&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last=Iverson |editor1-first=Cheryl |display-editors=etal |title=[[AMA Manual of Style]] |edition=10th |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] / Oxford University Press |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-517633-9 |chapter=8.3.1 Hyphen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* non–self-governing
* non–English-language journals
* non–group-specific blood
* non–Q-wave myocardial infarction
* non–brain-injured subjects

==== Differing recommendations ====
As discussed above, the en dash is sometimes recommended instead of a hyphen in [[compound adjectives]] where neither part of the adjective modifies the other—that is, when each modifies the noun, as in ''[[love–hate relationship]]''.

''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' (''CMOS''), however, limits the use of the en dash to two main purposes:
* First, use it to indicate ranges of time, money, or other amounts, or in certain other cases where it replaces the word ''to''.
* Second, use it in place of a hyphen in a compound adjective when one of the elements of the adjective is an open compound, or when two or more of its elements are compounds, open or hyphenated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Chicago Manual of Style]] |edition=15th |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2003 |pages=261–265 |isbn=0-226-10403-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, the ''CMOS'' favors hyphens in instances where some other guides suggest en dashes, the 16th edition explaining that "Chicago's sense of the en dash does not extend to ''between''", to rule out its use in "US–Canadian relations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Chicago Manual of Style |edition=16th [online] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2010 |at=&amp;sect;&amp;thinsp;6.80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these two uses, en dashes normally do not have spaces around them. An exception is made when avoiding spaces may cause confusion or look odd. For example, compare "12 June&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;3 July" with "12 June–3 July".&lt;ref name="harry shaw"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Harry |title=Errors in English and Ways to Correct Them |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |date=1986 |location=New York |page=185 |isbn=0-06-097047-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Parenthetic and other uses at the sentence level====
{{See also|#En dash versus em dash}}

Like em dashes, en dashes can be used instead of colons or pairs of commas that mark off a nested clause or phrase. They can also be used around parenthetical expressions&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; such as this one&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; in place of the em dashes preferred by some publishers,&lt;ref name="Complete Typographer"/&gt; particularly where short columns are used, since em dashes can look awkward at the end of a line. (See [[#En dash versus em dash|En dash versus em dash]] below.) In these situations, en dashes must have a single space on each side.

===== Itemization mark =====
Either the en dash or the em dash may be used as a [[Bullet (typography)|bullet]] at the start of each item in a bulleted list. (This is a matter of [[graphic design]] rather than [[orthography]].)

=== Typography ===

==== Spacing ====
In most uses of en dashes, such as when used in indicating ranges, they are closed up to the joined words. It is only when en dashes take the role of em dashes – for example, in setting off parenthetical statements such as this one – that they take spaces around them.&lt;ref name="OUP_New_Hart_4.11.1"&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Oxford University Press |title=[[New Hart's Rules: The Oxford Style Guide]] |chapter=4.11.1 En rule |chapter-url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/secondary/harts_rules/4-11-dashes?q=en+dash#en_dash |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{complete citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Year and edition missing; there are numerous versions of this, and they differ.}} For more on the choice of em versus en in this context, see [[#En dash versus em dash|En dash versus em dash]].

==== {{anchor|Encoding, substitution, and keyboard shortcuts}}Encoding and substitution ====
When an en dash is unavailable in a particular [[character encoding]] environment—as in the [[ASCII]] character set—there are some conventional substitutions. Often two hyphens are the substitute.

In Unicode, the en dash is U+2013 (decimal 8211). In HTML, one may use the numeric forms &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8211;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x2013;&lt;/code&gt;; there is also the HTML entity &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;ndash;&lt;/code&gt;.

The en dash is sometimes used as a substitute for the [[minus sign]], when the minus sign character is not available, since the en dash is usually the same width as a plus sign. For example, the original 8-bit [[Macintosh Character Set]] had an en dash, useful for the minus sign, years before Unicode with a dedicated minus sign was available. The hyphen-minus is usually too narrow to make a typographically acceptable minus sign. However, the en dash cannot be used for a minus sign in [[programming language]]s because the syntax usually requires a hyphen-minus.

== Em dash ==
The '''em dash''', '''em rule''', or '''mutton'''&lt;ref name="Stewart1919"&gt;{{Citation |last=Stewart |first=A.

The character is called an ''em dash'' because it is one [[em (typography)|em]] wide, a length that varies depending on the font size. One em is the same length as the font's height (which is typically measured in [[point (typography)|points]]). So in 9-point type, an em dash is 9 points wide, while in 24-point type the em dash is 24 points wide. By comparison, the en dash, with its 1-[[en (typography)|en]] width, is in most [[typeface|fonts]] either a half-em wide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ritter |first=Robert M. |title=[[The Oxford Guide to Style]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2002 |isbn=0-19-869175-0 |page=140 |quote=The en rule is, as its name indicates, an en in length, which makes it longer than a hyphen and half the length of an em rule.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
or the width of an "n".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Graphic Design, Referenced: A Visual Guide to the Language, Applications, and History of Graphic Design |first1=Bryony |last1=Gomez-Palacio |first2=Armin |last2=Vit |publisher=Rockport |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-59253-447-0 |page=75 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=EX6fxDG2Kl4C&amp;pg=PA75 |via=Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Usage ===
The em dash is used in several ways: primarily in places where a set of [[Bracket#Parentheses|parentheses]] or a [[colon (punctuation)|colon]] might otherwise be used,&lt;ref name="OUP_New_Hart_4.11.2"&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Oxford University Press |title=New Hart's Rules: The Oxford Style Guide |chapter=4.11.2 Em rule |url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/secondary/harts_rules/4-11-dashes?q=em+dash#em_dash |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{complete citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Year and edition missing; there are numerous versions of this, and they differ.}} it can show an abrupt change in thought or be used where a [[full stop]] (period) is too strong and a [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] too weak. Em dashes are also used to set off summaries or definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Webster's New World Punctuation: Simplified and Applied |first=Geraldine |last=Woods |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-7645-9916-3 |page=114 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=YyMoNCZlUAwC&amp;pg=PA114 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common uses and definitions are cited below with examples.

==== Colon-like use ====

===== Simple equivalence (or near-equivalence) of colon and em dash=====
* ''Three alkali metals are the usual substituents: sodium, potassium, and lithium.''
* ''Three alkali metals are the usual substituents—sodium, potassium, and lithium.''

===== Inversion of the function of a colon =====
* These are the colors of the flag:  red, white, and blue.
* Red, white, and blue—these are the colors of the flag.

==== Parentheses-like use ====

===== Simple equivalence (or near-equivalence) of paired parenthetical marks =====
* Compare parentheses with em dashes:
** ''Three alkali metals (sodium, potassium, and lithium) are the usual substituents.''
** ''Three alkali metals—sodium, potassium, and lithium—are the usual substituents.''
* Compare commas, em dashes and parentheses (respectively) when no internal commas intervene:
** ''The food, which was delicious, reminded me of home.''
** ''The food—which was delicious—reminded me of home.''
** ''The food (which was delicious) reminded me of home.''

===== Subtle differences in punctuation =====
It may indicate an interpolation stronger than that demarcated by parentheses, as in the following from [[Nicholson Baker]]'s ''[[The Mezzanine]]''.  (The degree of difference is subjective.) 
* "At that age I once stabbed my best friend, Fred, with a pair of pinking shears in the base of the neck, enraged because he had been given the comprehensive sixty-four-crayon Crayola box—including the gold and silver crayons—and would not let me look closely at the box to see how Crayola had stabilized the built-in crayon sharpener under the tiers of crayons."

==== Interruption of a speaker ====

===== Interruption by someone else =====
In this use, it is sometimes doubled:
* "But I'm trying to explain that I—" &lt;br /&gt;"I'm aware of your mitigating circumstances, but your negative attitude was excessive."

In a related use, it may visually indicate the shift between speakers when they overlap in speech. For example, the em dash is used this way in [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'':
* He was Cain, Ulysses, the Flying Dutchman; he was Lot in Sodom, Deirdre of the Sorrows, Sweeney in the nightingales among trees. He was the miracle ingredient Z-147. He was— &lt;br /&gt;"Crazy!" Clevinger interrupted, shrieking. "That's what you are! Crazy!"&lt;br /&gt;"—immense. I'm a real, slam-bang, honest-to-goodness, three-fisted humdinger. I'm a bona fide supraman."

=====Self-interruption=====
* Simple revision of a statement as one's thoughts evolve on the fly:
** "I believe I shall—no, I'm going to do it."
* Contemplative or emotional trailing off (usually in [[dialogue]] or in [[first person narrative]]):
** "I sense something; a presence I've not felt since—" in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = ''Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope'' |publisher = IMDb |accessdate = 10 August 2011 |url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/quotes?qt=qt0440693 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** "Get out or else—"
: Either an [[ellipsis]] or an em dash can indicate [[aposiopesis]], the [[rhetorical device]] by which a sentence is stopped short not because of interruption, but because the speaker is too emotional or pensive to continue. Because the ellipsis is the more common choice, an em dash for this purpose may be ambiguous in expository text, as many readers would assume interruption, although it may be used to indicate great emotion in dramatic [[monologue]].
* Long pause:
** In [[Early Modern English]] texts and afterward, em dashes have been used to add long pauses (as noted by Joseph Robertson's 1785 ''An Essay On Punctuation''): 
:: {{Quote|''Lord Cardinal! if thou think'st on heaven's bliss, &lt;br /&gt;Hold up thy hand, make signal of that hope.— &lt;br /&gt;He dies, and makes no sigh!''|[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], from ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]''}}

==== Quotation ====

===== Quotation mark-like use =====
This is a [[quotation dash]]. It may be distinct from an em dash in its coding (see [[#Horizontal bar|Horizontal bar]]). It may be used to indicate turns in a dialog, in which case each dash starts a paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Chicago Manual of Style |edition=16th |at=&amp;sect;&amp;thinsp;6.88, p. 335 |publisher=Chicago University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaces other quotation marks, and was preferred by authors such as [[James Joyce]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joyce |first=James |title=Ulysses |date=1922 |publisher=The Bodley Head |location=London |at=p. 335, lines 7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
: ―Oh saints above! Miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I wished I hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet
: ―Oh Miss Douce! Miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!

===== Attribution of quote source =====
* Inline quotes:
** ''A penny saved is a penny earned.'' — [[Benjamin Franklin]]
* Block quotes:
{{Quote|''&lt;poem&gt;
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand;
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
"If this were only cleared away,"
They said, "it would be grand!"&lt;/poem&gt;''|[[Lewis Carroll]]}}

==== Redaction ====
{{See also|Fillet (redaction)}}
An em dash may be used to indicate omitted letters in a word redacted to an initial or single letter or to [[Fillet (redaction)|fillet]] a word, by leaving the start and end letters whilst replacing the middle letters with a dash or dashes (for the purposes of [[sanitization (classified information)|censorship]] or simply [[data anonymization]]). In this use, it is sometimes doubled.
* ''It was alleged that D—— had been threatened with blackmail.''
Three em dashes might be used to indicate a completely missing word.&lt;ref name="trouble" /&gt;

==== Itemization mark ====
Either the en dash or the em dash may be used as a [[Bullet (typography)|bullet]] at the start of each item in a bulleted list, but a plain hyphen is more commonly used (and even mandatory in formats like [[Markdown]]).

==== Repetition ====
Three em dashes one after another can be used in a footnote, endnote, or another form of bibliographic entry to indicate repetition of the same author's name as that of the previous work,&lt;ref name="trouble"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sheerin |first1=Peter K |title=The Trouble With EM 'n EN (and Other Shady Characters) |url=https://alistapart.com/article/emen |website=alistapart.com |publisher=''[[A List Apart]]'' |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en |date=19 October 2001 |quote=Three adjacent em dashes (a 3-em dash) are used to substitute for the author’s name when a repeated series of works are presented in a bibliography, as well as to indicate an entire missing word in the text.}} Note that his ''Pete's Guide'' website has an updated version: [http://petesguide.com/perspective/001-emanden/ Version 2.0—May 27, 2002].  &lt;/ref&gt; which is similar to the use of [[ibid.]]

=== Typographic details ===

==== Spacing and substitution ====
According to most American sources (such as ''The Chicago Manual of Style'') and some British sources (such as ''[[Hart's Rules|The Oxford Guide to Style]]''), an em dash should always be set closed, meaning it should not be surrounded by spaces. But the practice in some parts of the English-speaking world, including the style recommended by ''[[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage]]'' for printed newspapers and the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'', sets it open, separating it from its surrounding words by using spaces or [[hair space]]s (U+200A) when it is being used parenthetically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apvschicago.com/2011/05/em-dashes-and-ellipses-closed-or-spaced.html |title=Em Dashes and Ellipses: Closed or Spaced Out? |last=Yin |first=Karen |work=AP vs. Chicago |date=31 May 2016 |accessdate=13 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yagoda, Ben. "[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/mad-dash/ Mad Dash]". ''The New York Times''. 22 October 2012. Accessed 31 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''AP Stylebook'' rejects the use of the open em dash to set off introductory items in lists.  Some writers, finding the em dash unappealingly long, prefer to use an open-set en dash. This "space, en dash, space" sequence is also the predominant style in German and French [[typography]]. (See [[#En dash versus em dash|En dash versus em dash]] below.)

On a practical note, when the em dash is set closed (not surrounded by spaces), it makes highlighting in ebooks difficult, as two words are often treated as conjoined.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- this might be a transient problem or a problem only with some software?--&gt;

In Canada, ''The Canadian Style: A Guide to Writing and Editing'', ''The Oxford Canadian A to Z of Grammar, Spelling &amp; Punctuation: Guide to Canadian English Usage'' (2nd ed.), ''Editing Canadian English'', and the ''Canadian Oxford Dictionary'' all specify that an em dash should be set closed when used between words, a word and numeral, or two numerals.

The Australian government's ''Style Manual for Authors, Editors and Printers'' (6th ed.), also specifies that em dashes inserted between words, a word and numeral, or two numerals, should be set closed. A section on the 2-em rule (⸺) also explains that the 2-em can be used to mark an abrupt break in direct or reported speech, but a space is used before the 2-em if a complete word is missing, while no space is used if part of a word exists before the sudden break. Two examples of this are as follows (properly typeset 2-em and 3-em dashes should appear as a single dash, but they may show on this page as several em dashes with spaces in between):
* I distinctly heard him say, "Go away or I'll ——".
* It was alleged that D—— had been threatened with blackmail.

Monospaced fonts that mimic the look of a typewriter have the same width for all characters. Some of these fonts have em and en dashes that more or less fill the monospaced width they have available. For example, the sequence "hyphen, en dash, em dash, minus" shows as "&lt;code&gt;- – — −&lt;/code&gt;" in a monospace font.

==== Approximating the em dash with two or three hyphens ====
When an em dash is unavailable in a particular [[character encoding]] environment—as in the [[ASCII]] character set—it has usually been [[typographic approximation|approximated]] as a double&amp;nbsp;(--) or triple&amp;nbsp;(---) hyphen-minus. The two-hyphen em dash proxy is perhaps more common, being a widespread convention in the [[typewriter|typewriting]] era. (It is still described for hard copy manuscript preparation in the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' as of the 16th edition, although the manual conveys that typewritten manuscript and copyediting on paper are now dated practices). The three-hyphen em dash proxy was popular with various publishers because the sequence of one, two, or three hyphens could then correspond to the hyphen, en dash, and em dash, respectively.

Because early comic book [[letterer]]s were not aware of the typographic convention of replacing a typewritten double hyphen with an em dash, the double hyphen became traditional in American comics. This practice has continued despite the development of computer lettering.&lt;ref name=NatePiekos2012&gt;{{cite web|last=Piekos |first=Nate |title=Comic Book Grammar &amp; Tradition |url=http://www.blambot.com/grammar.shtml |accessdate=29 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221085635/http://www.blambot.com/grammar.shtml |archivedate=21 December 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ToddKlein2008&gt;{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Todd|title=Punctuating Comics: Dots and Dashes|url=http://kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=1946|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== En dash versus em dash ==
[[File:Dash font comparison.png|thumb|right|These comparisons of the hyphen (-), en dash (–), and em dash (—), in various 12-point fonts, illustrate the typical relationship between lengths ("- n – m —"). In some fonts, the en dash is not much longer than the hyphen, and in [[Lucida Grande]], the en dash is actually shorter than the hyphen.]]

The en dash is wider than the [[hyphen]] but not as wide as the em dash. An [[Em (typography)#Incorrect and alternate definitions|em width]] is defined as the point size of the currently used font, since the M character is not always the width of the point size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A glossary of typographic terms |publisher=Adobe |accessdate=18 October 2007 |url=https://www.adobe.com/uk/type/topics/glossary.html#ememspaceemquad}}&lt;/ref&gt; In running text, various dash conventions are employed: an em dash—like so—or a spaced em dash — like so — or a spaced en dash – like so – can be seen in contemporary publications.

Various style guides and national varieties of languages prescribe different guidance on dashes. Dashes have been cited as being treated differently in the US and the UK, with the former preferring the use of an em dash with no additional spacing and the latter preferring a spaced en dash.&lt;ref name="Complete Typographer"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Hill |last=Will |title = The Complete Typographer: A Foundation Course for Graphic Designers Working With Type |edition=3rd |year=2010 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |ISBN = 978-0-500-28894-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples of the US style, ''The Chicago Manual of Style'' and ''[[APA style|The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association]]'' recommend unspaced em dashes. Style guides outside the US are more variable. For example, ''[[The Elements of Typographic Style]]'' by Canadian typographer [[Robert Bringhurst]] recommends the spaced en dash – like so – and argues that the length and visual magnitude of an em dash "belongs to the padded and corseted aesthetic of Victorian typography".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title = The elements of typographic style |edition=third |first=Robert |last=Bringhurst |publisher = Hartley &amp; Marks, Publishers |year=2004 |ISBN = 978-0-88179-206-5 |page = 80 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=uKkQAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22belongs+to+the+padded+and+corseted+aesthetic%22&amp;q=corseted+aesthetic#search_anchor }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United Kingdom, the spaced en dash is the house style for certain major publishers, including the [[Penguin Group]], the [[Cambridge University Press]], and [[Routledge]]. However, this convention is not universal. The ''Oxford Guide to Style'' (2002, section 5.10.10) acknowledges that the spaced en dash is used by "other British publishers" but states that the [[Oxford University Press]], like "most US publishers", uses the unspaced em dash.

The en dash – always with spaces in running text when, as discussed in this section, indicating a parenthesis or pause – and the spaced em dash both have a certain technical advantage over the unspaced em dash. Most typesetting and word processing expects word spacing to vary to support [[Justification (typesetting)|full justification]]. Alone among punctuation that marks pauses or logical relations in text, the unspaced em dash disables this for the words it falls between. This can cause uneven spacing in the text, but can be mitigated by the use of [[thin space]]s, [[hair space]]s, or even [[zero-width space]]s on the sides of the em dash. This provides the appearance of an unspaced em dash, but allows the words and dashes to break between lines. The spaced em dash risks introducing excessive separation of words. In full justification, the adjacent spaces may be stretched, and the separation of words further exaggerated. En dashes may also be preferred to em dashes when text is set in narrow columns, such as in newspapers and similar publications, since the en dash is smaller. In such cases, its use is based purely on space considerations and is not necessarily related to other typographical concerns.

On the other hand, a spaced en dash may be ambiguous when it is also used for ranges, for example, in dates or between geographical locations with internal spaces.

==Horizontal bar==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Horizontal bar]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Quotation mark#Quotation dash}}

{{unichar|2015|'''Horizontal bar'''|ulink=Unicode}}, also known as a '''quotation dash''', is used to introduce quoted text. This is the standard method of printing [[dialogue]] in some languages. The em dash is equally suitable if the quotation dash is unavailable or is contrary to the house style being used.

There is no support in the standard TeX fonts, but one can use &lt;code&gt;\hbox{---}\kern-.5em---&lt;/code&gt; instead, or just use an em dash.

== Swung dash==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dash]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Tilde#Punctuation}}

{{unichar|2053|'''swung dash'''|ulink=Unicode}} resembles a lengthened [[tilde]], and is used to separate alternatives or approximates. In [[dictionary|dictionaries]], it is frequently used to stand in for the term being defined.  A dictionary entry providing an example for the term ''henceforth'' might employ the swung dash as follows:

:''henceforth'' (adv.) from this time forth; from now on; "&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;⁓&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; she will be known as Mrs. Wales"

There are several similar, related characters:
* {{unichar|007E|TILDE}} (see below)
* {{unichar|02DC|SMALL TILDE}} (see below)
* {{unichar|223C|Tilde operator}}, used in mathematics. Ends not curved as much regular tilde. In [[TeX]] and [[LaTeX]], this character can be expressed using the math mode command &lt;code&gt;$\sim$&lt;/code&gt;.
* {{unichar|301C|Wave dash}}, used in East Asian typography for a variety of purposes, including [[Japanese punctuation#Wave dash|Japanese punctuation]].
* {{unichar|FF5E|Fullwidth tilde}} is a compatibility character for a wide tilde used in East Asian typography.

== In other languages ==
In many languages, such as [[Polish language|Polish]], the em dash is used as an opening [[Quotation mark#Quotation dash|quotation mark]]. There is no matching closing quotation mark; typically a new paragraph will be started, introduced by a dash, for each turn in the dialog.

[[Corpus linguistics|Corpus]] studies indicate that em dashes are more commonly used in Russian than in English.&lt;ref name="AngelelliJacobson2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Claudia V. Angelelli |author2 = Holly E. Jacobson |title = Testing and assessment in translation and interpreting studies: a call for dialogue between research and practice |url = https://books.google.com/?id=3dzk1a7gOnAC&amp;pg=PA174 |year = 2009 |publisher = John Benjamins Publishing Company |ISBN = 978-90-272-3190-1 |page = 174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russian, the em dash is used for the present [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] (meaning "am"/"is"/"are"), which is unpronounced in spoken Russian.

In [[French language|French]], em or en dashes can be used as [[parentheses]] (brackets), but the use of a second dash as a closing parenthesis is optional. When a closing dash is not used the sentence is ended with a period (full-stop) as usual. Dashes are, however, much less common than parentheses.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], em dashes can be used to mark off parenthetical phrases. Unlike in English, the em dashes are spaced like brackets, i.e., there is a space between main sentence and dash, but not between parenthetical phrase and dash.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lema.rae.es/dpd/?key=raya Raya]". In: ''Diccionario panhispánico de dudas''. Madrid: Real Academia Española, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[http://www.uamenlinea.uam.mx/materiales/lengua/puntuacion/html/raya.htm]

==Rendering dashes on computers==
{{hatnote|For insertion of dashes using their Unicode code points (U+2013 for en dash and U+2014 for em dash), see [[Unicode input]].}}

Typewriters and early computers have traditionally had only a limited [[character (computing)|character]] set, often having no key that produces a dash. In consequence, it became common to substitute the nearest available punctuation mark or symbol. Em dashes are often represented in British usage by a single hyphen-minus surrounded by spaces, or in American usage by two hyphen-minuses surrounded by spaces.

Modern computer software typically has support for many more characters and is usually capable of rendering both the en and em dashes correctly—albeit sometimes with an inconvenient input method. Some software, though, may operate in a more limited mode. Some text editors, for example, are restricted to working with a single 8-bit [[character encoding]], and when unencodable characters are entered—for example by pasting from the clipboard—they are often blindly converted to question marks. Sometimes this happens to em and en dashes, even when the 8-bit encoding supports them or when an alternative representation using hyphen-minuses is an option.

Any kind of dash can be used directly in an [[HTML]] document, but HTML also lets them be entered using character references. The em dash and the en dash are special in that they can be written using [[character entity reference]]s as {{code|&amp;mdash;}} and {{code|&amp;ndash;}}, respectively. [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] provides for entry of HTML sequences including {{code|&amp;mdash;}} and {{code|&amp;ndash;}} using its Insert drop-down menu.

* In [[UNIX]] and [[GNU]]/[[Linux]], there are various methods of producing these dashes:
** For em dashes, one may use the [[compose key|compose/multi key]] followed by three presses of the hyphen character. For en dashes, one may press the compose key followed by two hyphens and a period. Also, other keys may be remapped to create dashes.
** In [[X Window System]], the em dash may be entered by pressing the [[compose key]] and three hyphens.
** In [[GTK+]] applications (including outside Unix/Linux, such as in [[The GIMP]]), all dashes and other Unicode characters can be produced with {{key press|shift|ctrl|u}}, which displays a &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then enter a Unicode number for the appropriate dash, and then press the space bar or the enter/return key. For example, {{key press|shift|ctrl|u}} and &lt;code&gt;2013&lt;/code&gt; creates an en dash; the number &lt;code&gt;2014&lt;/code&gt; is for creating an em dash.
* For the en dash, [[LaTeX]] has the macro (&lt;code&gt;\textendash&lt;/code&gt;). 
* In [[macOS]] using the Australian, British, Canadian, Finnish, French, German, Irish, Irish Extended, Italian, Pro Italian, Russian, US, US Extended, or Welsh keyboard layout, an en dash can be obtained by typing {{keypress|Opt|-}}, while an em dash can be typed with {{keypress|Opt|Shift|-}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Typing Special Characters on a Macintosh Keyboard |url = http://www.forlang.wsu.edu/help/keyboards2.asp |publisher=Washington State University|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In [[TeX]], an em dash (—) is typed as three hyphen‐minuses (&lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt;) and an en dash (–) as two hyphen‐minuses (&lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;). Mathematical minus (−) is signified as &lt;code&gt;$-$&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\(-\)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url = http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/reference/characters/#dash |location = CA |publisher = SFI |last = Baker |first = GG |title = Characters |type = reference |contribution = Dash }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] systems, an en or em dash may be entered by pressing the [[Compose key]] (usually left Alt), followed by typing {{kbd|en}} or {{kbd|em}} respectively.
* In [[Microsoft Windows]], with [[Num lock]] enabled for [[numeric keypad]]s or on laptop keyboards, an en- or em-dash may be typed into most text areas by using their respective [[Alt code]] by holding down the [[Alt key]] and pressing either {{key press|0}}{{key press|1}}{{key press|5}}{{key press|0}} for the en dash, or {{key press|Alt|0}}{{key press|1}}{{key press|5}}{{key press|1}} for the em dash. [[Num Lock]] must be enabled for Alt code combinations to work. In addition, the [[Character Map (Windows)|Character Map]] utility included with Windows can be used to copy and paste en and em dash characters into most applications; if an Alt code exists for a character, a user can click on it in the character map, and see the corresponding Alt code in the app's status bar.
* In [[Microsoft Word]] running on a computer whose keyboard has a numeric keypad, an em dash can be typed with {{key press|Ctrl|Alt|-}} (on the numeric keypad, with the numeric hyphen usually in the top-right corner), and an en dash can be typed with {{key press|Ctrl|-}}. This does not work with the hyphen key on the main keyboard (between "0" and "=" with a US or UK layout), which has completely different functions. With Microsoft Word's default settings, in both Windows and Macintosh versions, an em dash symbol, which is not always a true em dash from the font, is automatically produced by [[Autocorrect]] when two unspaced hyphens are entered between words (as in "word--word"). An en dash, which again, is not always a true en dash from the font, is automatically produced when one or two hyphens surrounded by spaces are entered: ("word - word") or ("word -- word"). This feature can be disabled by customizing Autocorrect.
:To determine if the true en- or em-dash from the font are being used, rather than a cross-referenced character from the Symbol font, one can copy and paste a sample of the dash into Word or [[WordPad]] followed by {{key press|Alt|X}}. The hexadecimal Unicode number will appear, revealing whether the character is a true en- or em-dash (Unicode &lt;code&gt;2013&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;2014&lt;/code&gt;). Using the true dash is important, if one needs to share documents with other users in other applications or operating systems.
:The true en- and em-dash, along with other dashes, spaces, and special characters, such as the true minus sign, can be inserted through the Insert menu without the use of the numeric keypad, which some keyboard layouts do not always provide. These symbols can also be assigned keyboard shortcuts through this menu.

The '''death-grip''' or '''death-grip syndrome''' are slang terms for an aggressive and recurrent [[masturbation]] technique. According to some, it ultimately results in an inability to achieve orgasm with a partner due to desensitization from overstimulation.

Death-grip syndrome, sometimes abbreviated as DGS, is sometimes viewed as a subcategory of [[Inhibited ejaculation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/masturbation-death-grip-syndrome-dgs|title=Masturbation Death Grip Syndrome (DGS) {{!}} SexInfo Online|website=www.soc.ucsb.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was arguably coined in 2003 by sexpert [[Dan Savage]] and is an issue that affects both men and women. The concept however is, as of 2018, not recognized by medical bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/kzxajn/women-get-death-grip-syndrome-too-and-it-sucks|title=Women Get 'Death Grip Syndrome' Too, and It Sucks|date=22 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers have suggested such an indisposition arises from penile nerve endings becoming accustomized to more rough friction such as ribbed towels or other cloths used to catch semen. This, along with learned pressure, such as a specific hand speed may have subsequently altered sensory patters in the genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/19/does-my-boyfriends-masturbation-style-prevent-him-orgasming-during-sex|title=Does my boyfriend’s masturbation style prevent him orgasming during sex?|first=Pamela Stephenson|last=Connolly|date=19 February 2018|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have attributed it to normal masturbation that is excessive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/32696-can-you-masturbate-too-much-maybe|title=Can You Masturbate Too Much?

Although men with the indisposition may still experience an [[erection]], it may embroil a relationship negatively due to a sense of being sexually incompatible with a partner due to lasting too long, and subsequent side-effects such as [[blue balls]] or inhibited [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref&gt;POLONSKY, DEREK C. "The Sexual Challenges and Dilemmas of Young Single Men." Handbook of Clinical Sexuality for Mental Health Professionals (2011): 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Some people who have claimed to have masturbated using the death-grip technique claim that although they can still experience pleasure, the typical vagina feels too loose, and [[fellatio]] provides insufficient friction to produce an orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;Flemons, Douglas, and Shelley Green. "Just between us: A relational approach to sex therapy." Quickies: The handbook of brief sex therapy (2004): 126-170.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Santucci, chief of urology at Detroit Receiving's Center for Urologic Reconstruction, has criticized the notion that this masturbation technique causes any issues. Therapist Michael A. Perelman on the other hand attributes the issue to a lack of diversity within masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2015/11/22/men_theres_an_obvious_easy_way_to_avoid_losing_penis_sensitivity_partner/|title=“Men are rubbing themselves raw”: The trick to avoid losing penis sensitivity|date=22 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some broader denotations of the death-grip are becoming accustomized to a very specific means of reaching orgasm, or the effects of constrictive pressure of a waistand, belt or undersized pouch on an erection.&lt;ref&gt;Gudelunas, David.

:''For the "declaratory power" in Canadian law, see [[Section 92(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867]]''

The '''declaratory power''', in [[Scots law]], is an unusual power held by the [[High Court of Justiciary]], which enables it to declare behaviour to be criminal, even if that behaviour had not been previously defined as criminal activity.

This power has been used conservatively in the modern period, generally only in cases where an act is clearly comparable to an existing crime; it has, for example, been used to declare the selling of kits for [[glue-sniffing]] criminal. As the specific boundaries of many offences are left somewhat loosely defined, it can be difficult to distinguish the application of the declaratory power from cases where the court interprets existing legislation to cover new situations.

[[File:Lord-ellenborough.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Although Lord Ellenborough (pictured) rejected a categorical application of the rule ''falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus'' for English courts in the year 1809, the doctrine survives in some American jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;''Enying Li v. Holder'', 738 F.3d 1160 (9th Cir. 2013) (upholding doctrine).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "false in one thing, false in everything."&lt;ref&gt;''Enying Li v. Holder'', 738 F.3d 1160, 1165 (9th Cir. 2013) (defining phrase).&lt;/ref&gt; At [[common law]], it is the legal principle that a witness who [[testimony|testifies]] falsely about one matter is not credible to testify about any matter.&lt;ref&gt;''Kanawha &amp; M. Ry. Co. v. Kerse'', {{ussc|239|page=576|pin=581|year=1916}} ("[T]he jury may reasonably have concluded that their testimony should be rejected in toto ...")&lt;/ref&gt; Although many common law jurisdictions have rejected a categorical application of the rule, the doctrine has survived in some American courts.&lt;ref&gt;George Fisher, ''The Jury's Rise As Lie Detector'', 107 {{smallcaps|[[Yale Law Journal|Yale L. J.]]}} 575, 713 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The origins of the doctrine of ''falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus'' in the common law have been traced as far back as the [[Popish Plot|Stuart Treason Trials]] in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;George Fisher, ''The Jury's Rise As Lie Detector'', 107 {{smallcaps|Yale Law Journal|Yale L. J.}} 575, 713 (1997) (citing 3 {{smallcaps|Wigmore}}, supra note 44, § 1009, at 675).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the widespread acceptance of the principle in seventeenth century English courts suggests that the doctrine has much earlier roots.&lt;ref&gt;George Fisher, ''The Jury's Rise As Lie Detector'', 107 {{smallcaps|Yale Law Journal|Yale L. J.}} 575, 713 (1997) ("Although Wigmore did not find earlier expressions of the rule, its repeated appearance in the trials of this era suggests it had earlier roots.").&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the principle functioned as a mandatory presumption that a witness was unreliable if they previously lied while offering testimony.&lt;ref&gt;George Fisher, ''The Jury's Rise As Lie Detector'', 107 {{smallcaps|Yale Law Journal|Yale L. J.}} 575, 655 (1997) ("In its original form, the rule of falsus in uno was mandatory.").&lt;/ref&gt; By the early nineteenth century, English courts began instructing juries that they may presume a witness who testified falsely was unreliable, but such a presumption was not mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;See 3 {{smallcaps|Wigmore}}, supra note 44, § 1010, at 676.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1809, [[Lord Ellenborough]] rejected a categorical application of the rule, stating that "though a person may be proved on his own shewing, or by other evidence, to have foresworn himself as to a particular fact; it does not follow that he can never afterwards feel the obligation of an oath."&lt;ref&gt;4 A.L.R. 2d 1077 (Originally published in 1949) (citing ''Rex v. Teal'' (1809) 11 East 307, 103 Eng Reprint 1022).&lt;/ref&gt; Although some American courts disfavor the mandatory application of the doctrine, others continue to uphold a mandatory presumption of unreliability for witnesses that have previously testified falsely.&lt;ref&gt;George Fisher, ''The Jury's Rise As Lie Detector'', 107 {{smallcaps|Yale Law Journal|Yale L. J.}} 575, 713 (1997); see also ''Enying Li v. Holder'', 738 F.3d 1160 (9th Cir. 2013) (upholding doctrine); ''The Santissima Trinidad'', 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 283, 339 (1822) (requiring mandatory presumption).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary usage==
Today, many jurisdictions have abandoned the principle as a formal rule of evidence and instead apply the rule as a "permissible inference that the jury may or may not draw."&lt;ref&gt;98 ''[[Corpus Juris Secundum|C. J. S.]]'', Witnesses § 636.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some courts continue to apply the doctrine to discredit witnesses that have previously offered false testimony.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Siewe v. Gonzales'', 480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir. 2007) (holding that "a finding of fraudulent evidence redounds upon all evidence the probative force of which relies in any part on the credibility of the petitioner").&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, for example, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] held that in immigration cases, a court may "use an adverse credibility finding on one claim to support an adverse finding on another claim."&lt;ref&gt;''Enying Li v. Holder'', 738 F.3d 1160, 1168 (9th Cir. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, at the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson murder trial]], Judge [[Lance Ito]] applied the doctrine to instruct the jury that "[a] witness who is willfully false in one material part of his or her testimony is to be distrusted in others."&lt;ref&gt;George Fisher, ''The Jury's Rise As Lie Detector'', 107 {{smallcaps|Yale Law Journal|Yale L. J.}} 575, 700 (1997) (discussing use of doctrine with regard to the testimony of Detective [[Mark Fuhrman]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2018 confirmation hearings into the [[Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination]], Senator [[Richard Blumenthal]] questioned Kavanaugh's credibility when he asked Kavanaugh if he was familiar with the words, {{Lang|la|Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/09/the-four-big-contradictions-in-brett-kavanaughs-senate-testimony/ "The Four Big Contradictions in Brett Kavanaugh's Senate Testimony"] by Tim Murphy, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', September 27, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of the doctrine==
Many legal scholars have criticized the continued use of the doctrine of ''falsus in uno'' to discredit a witness' entire testimony.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Rempell, [http://www.tilj.org/content/journal/44/num2/Rempell185.pdf ''Credibility Assessments &amp; the REAL ID Act's Amendments to Immigration Law''], 44 {{smallcaps|Tex. Int'l L.J.}} 185, 213 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Judge [[Richard Posner]] once remarked that ''falsus in uno'' was a "discredited doctrine" based on "primitive psychology." This assertion was not made in relation to fraudulent documentation or a “material” inconsistency; rather, it was based on what the court characterizes as “innocent mistakes, trivial inconsistencies, and harmless exaggerations” by the applicant during his testimony before an immigration judge. Indeed, later in the Kadia opinion, the court concedes that inconsistencies of less than material importance can be relevant to the assessment of veracity. Specifically, the court stated that “the mistakes that witnesses make in all innocence must be distinguished from slips that, whether or not they go to the core of the witness's testimony, show that the witness is a liar.”&lt;ref&gt;''Kadia v. Gonzales'', 501 F.3d 817, 821 (7th Cir. 2007) (citing John H. Wigmore, {{smallcaps|A Students' Textbook of the Law of Evidence}}, 181 (1935)).&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Posner argued that because witnesses "are prone to fudge, to fumble, to misspeak, to misstate, to exaggerate," few trials would reach a judgment if "any such pratfall warranted disbelieving a witness's entire testimony."&lt;ref&gt;''Kadia v. Gonzales'', 501 F.3d 817, 821 (7th Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, evidence scholar [[John Henry Wigmore]] was an outspoken critic of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Virginian Ry. Co. v. Armentrout'', 166 F.2d 400, 405–06 (4th Cir. 1948) (noting WIgmore's disapproval of the doctrine).&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Treatise on the Anglo-American System of Evidence in Trials at Common Law'', he wrote:

{{quote|It may be said, once for all, that the maxim is in itself worthless, first, in point of validity, because in one form it merely contains in loose fashion a kernel of truth which no one needs to be told, and in the others it is absolutely false as a maxim of life; and secondly, in point of utility, because it merely tells the jury what they may do in any event, not what they must do or must not do, and therefore it is a superfluous form of words. It is also in practice pernicious, first, because there is frequently a misunderstanding of its proper force, and secondly, because it has become in the hands of many counsel a mere instrument for obtaining new trials upon points wholly unimportant in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;2 {{smallcaps|Wigmore}}, 2d Ed., p. 449. {{incomplete short citation|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10228">'''Gaspar da Gama''' also known as '''Gaspar da India''' and '''Gaspar de Almeida''' (probably [[Poznań]], Poland c. 1444 - [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], India or [[Lisbon]], Portugal c. 1510) was a traveller of [[Jewish]] origin who acted as [[interpreter]] ("Língua", in old Portuguese) and provided many services to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Portuguese discoveries|maritime explorations]], since being first approached or captured by [[Vasco da Gama]]'s fleet returning from the first travel from Europe to India.&lt;ref name="JVL1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gaspar da Gama|trans-title=|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/gaspar-da-gama|first=|last=|authorlink=|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|location=Chevy Chase, Maryland|date=|page=|language=|volume=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably born in the Kingdom of Poland, in [[Poznań]], later [[naturalized]] in [[Portugal]]. He sailed with several Portuguese fleets between Europe and India, including the fleet of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] that discovered [[Brazil]] and was known to speak several East and West languages. 

== Biography ==
=== Before meeting the Portuguese ===
His original name is unknown. He appears with the name "Gaspar da Gama" or "Gaspar of the Indies" in the chronicles and reports of discovery written by [[Gaspar Correia]], [[Fernão Lopes de Castanheda]], [[Jerónimo Osório]], [[Damião de Góis]] and [[Álvaro Velho]] but was known to Indians as ''Mahmet''. Some sources confuse the latest with [[Gaspar de Lemos]], a Portuguese sailor who commanded a ship in the fleet that discovered Brazil. Other sources also call him "Gaspar de Almeida" given his friendship with [[Francisco de Almeida]], 1st [[Viceroy of India]].&lt;ref name="jvt"&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/GaspardaGama.html Jewish Library. Gaspar da Gama] (visitado em 3 de dezembro de 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several versions of his life before meeting [[Vasco da Gama]] in India.&lt;ref name="lipener"&gt;LIPINER, Elias. Gaspar da Gama: Um Converso na Frota de Cabral. Rio de Janeiro: Ed. Nova Fronteira ''apud'' [http://www.judaica.com.br/materias/063_03e04.htm CORDEIRO, Hélio Daniel. Gaspar da Gama: um judeu no Descobrimento do Brasil. Revista Judaica, n. 63, abril/2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203180414/http://www.judaica.com.br/materias/063_03e04.htm |date=2008-12-03 }} (visitado em 3 de dezembro de 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were sourced at Gaspar da Gama himself, but he probably tried to hide some "inconvenient" facts about his own past. According to Gaspar's own account, he became a Jewish traveller, making his way to [[Jerusalem]], and then [[Alexandria]], where he was taken prisoner and sold as a slave in India, in India he secured his freedom in the service of the ruler of [[Goa]].&lt;ref name="JVL1" /&gt; The [[chronicler]] Gaspar Correia states that, when found by the Portuguese, Gaspar da Gama was Captain of the fleet of [[Yusuf Adil Shah]], the [[Bijapur Sultanate|Sultan of Bijapur]], Arab governor of [[Goa]] in India.&lt;ref name="cordeiro"/&gt; Damião de Góis says Gaspar da Gama was a Jew born in the city of [[Poznań]] in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and that at that time he did not speak Spanish, but the [[Venetian language]],&lt;ref name="magno"/&gt; the very language used in European based commercial centers in the East.

===Controversy===
The historian [[João de Barros]], reports that the very Gaspar da Gama informed him that his parents were from Bosna (or Posner, i.e., Poznan) in Poland. His parents migrated to [[Jerusalem]] and then to [[Alexandria]], where Gaspar da Gama was born. The Israeli journalist Elias Lipiner, studied the documentation of the Portuguese chroniclers of the [[Age of Discovery]] and considered João de Barros version as the most faithful to facts, suggesting that Gaspar da Gama must have been born in [[Alexandria]] (Egypt) around 1458.&lt;ref name="cordeiro"/&gt; Following [[Radhanite|Jewish Radhanite trade routes]] at the time, he went very young to India where he established himself as a merchant. Other historians, such as the scholar of Brazilian Jewish history Arnold Wiznitzer, think he was born in [[Granada]] or circa 1440 in Bosnia (perhaps confusion with the name of Poznan).

=== Meeting the Portuguese ===
In 1498, when the returning Vasco da Gama fleet landed on the [[Anjadip Island|island of Angediva]], about 20 miles off the coast of Goa, Gaspar da Gama, uninvited, went on the ship of Vasco da Gama and asked happily to go aboard, to visit his native Spain.&lt;ref name="magno"&gt;[http://www2.correioweb.com.br/hotsites/500anos/portugal-brasil/dia29/dia29-1.htm MAGNO, Ana Beatriz. Torre de Babel. CorreioWeb - 500 Anos de Brasil. O vigésimo nono dia da viagem]  (visitado em 4 de dezembro de 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasco Da Gama, Ernest George Ravenstein, [https://books.google.com/books?id=amXCE7J87DQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "A journal of the first voyage of Vasco da Gama, 1497-1499"], Asian Educational Services, 1995, {{ISBN|81-206-1136-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then more than 50 years age, with white beard, with louder and clear manners than that of the Indians of region. As reported by Álvaro Velho, clerk of the Portuguese fleet, Gaspar da Gama said that he was "working for a powerful lord who owns an army of more than 40 thousand horsemen, and that upon hearing of their arrival he had asked to see them. If not he would have died of sadness."

Vasco da Gama pretended to believe, and discreetly sent men to Anjadip Island to get information about the visitor.&lt;ref name="magno"/&gt; Some reliable merchants told that he was a spy, preparing a surprise attack. Upon this, Vasco da Gama had the visitor whipped and interrogated under torture. After having hot oil dropped on his skin, Gaspar da Gama told he was a Jew from [[Granada]] who had converted to Christianity and after traveling to Turkey and Mecca went to the Indies, and that there was no plan to attack the Portuguese. After 12 days of interrogation, Vasco da Gama came to rely more on the prisoner. He gave him a cheese and two soft breads and Gaspar da Gama told him that, after all, he was very happy to find these "Franks".&lt;ref name="magno"/&gt;

Vasco da Gama kept Gaspar as a prisoner and took him on the eventful trip back to Portugal, perhaps considering that his knowledge of the East would be useful. During the long return, Gaspar da Gama befriended the Portuguese, and especially Vasco da Gama. He was baptized the following year, Vasco da Gama being his godfather and gaving him his own surname. The first name - Gaspar - had been chosen as a reference to its origins, being the name of one of [[three Magi]] from the East who visited Jesus.&lt;ref name="cordeiro"&gt;[http://www.judaica.com.br/materias/063_03e04.htm CORDEIRO, Hélio Daniel. Gaspar da Gama: um judeu no Descobrimento do Brasil. Revista Judaica, n. 63, abril/2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203180414/http://www.judaica.com.br/materias/063_03e04.htm |date=2008-12-03 }} (visitado em 3 de dezembro de 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Portugal and back to India===
King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] enjoyed Gaspar da Gama and called him frequently to the court, to hear his stories about the land and customs of the East. There was a suspicion that Gaspar da Gama was an Arabic spy, but the Portuguese recognized his value, because beside having traded in some of their centers in India, he spoke [[Latin]], [[Arabic]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and some languages of India. Because of this, the King Manuel I appointed him counselor and interpreter of the second fleet sailing to the Indies, led by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]].&lt;ref name="cordeiro"/&gt;

Always with a cap on his head and dressed in white linen, Gaspar da Gama was one of the more exotic characters in the fleet of Pedro Álvares Cabral.&lt;ref name="lipener"/&gt; Although not the only linguist at the expedition that discovered the Brazil, he was the main interpreter in the trade negotiations between the Portuguese and Brazilian Indians, along with Gonçalo Madeira. Once in India, Gaspar da Gama fulfilled his mission with his interpreter services and knowledge of geopolitics and customs of India important in business meetings of Portuguese and Indian rajas in Calicut and Cochin.

He returned on his own will to Portugal with Pedro Álvares Cabral. In 1501, the fleet met the expedition of [[Gaspar de Lemos]] appointed by the king of Portugal to explore the newly discovered lands of Brazil, near modern Dakar, Senegal. Talks between Gaspar da Gama and other members of the expedition with the Florentine [[Amerigo Vespucci]] who accompanied Gaspar de Lemos certainly strengthened the idea that the lands discovered by Christopher Columbus were not the Indies, but a new continent.

In 1502 Gaspar da Gama participated in another travel to India commanded by Vasco da Gama, and again in 1505 with the recently appointed viceroy [[Francisco de Almeida]]. During these trips, he learned a few African languages.

He participated in the Indian expeditions of the Portuguese who tried to conquer Hormuz in 1508 and Calicut in 1510, when some assume that he died. Others believe that he returned to Portugal where he died. Some say that his death occurred between 1510 and 1515, or even by about 1520, with nearly eighty years. The change of Christian name "[[Terra de Santa Cruz]]" to "Brazil" is attributed by some to Gaspar da Gama and [[Fernão de Noronha]], both being Jewish. However, this does not have an historical basis, being due to the intense trade in [[Brazilwood]].

"Bodimo ponosni, da smo Slovenci." ''Slovenska država'' 27(2): 3.]&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are only a few speakers left in Slovenia and around the world.

== Language history ==
Gottscheerish belongs to [[Southern Bavarian]] within the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] dialect group. The Bavarian dialects of [[Carinthia]] are closest to it. Gottscheerish shares a lot of properties with the Bavarian dialects of the German language islands of the [[eastern Alps]], among them [[Cimbrian language|Cimbrian]] in [[Veneto]], [[Sappada]] (Pladen), and [[Paluzza|Timau]] (Tischelwang) in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], and [[Zgornja Sorica|Sorica]] (Zarz) in [[Upper Carniola]] (Slovenia).

Gottscheerish developed independently for more than 600 years from the settlement of the first German-speaking settlers from Eastern Tyrol and Western Carinthia around 1330.

The Gottscheer Germans used Gottscheerish as oral language for daily communication, whereas their written language was [[Standard German]]. However, [[Folk music|folk songs]] and [[Oral tradition|folk tales]] collected in the 19th and 20th century have been published in Gottscheerish.

Already in the 19th century many speakers of Gottscheerish left their homes to emigrate to the [[United States]]. After resettlement of most Gottscheers by the German occupation forces in 1941 during the [[Slovene Lands in World War II|Second World War]] only a few hundred speakers of Gottscheerish remained in their homeland. After the war Gottscheerish was forbidden in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

== Present situation ==
According to the [[UNESCO]], Gottscheerish is a "critically endangered language". The majority of its speakers live in the U.S., with a significant community in [[Queens]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20716344 Turin, Mark. 2012. "New York, a graveyard for languages." BBC, 16 December.]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them are of the oldest generation, who spent their childhood in Gottschee County. There are speakers in [[Canada]], Austria and Germany as well, but just as in the U.S. they have hardly any opportunity to practice it. Everyday language in the family and elsewhere is English and German or the local dialect, respectively.&lt;ref name="moric"&gt;[http://dk.fdv.uni-lj.si/diplomska/pdfs/moric-anja.pdf Anja Moric: Usoda Kočevskih Nemcev - Ohranjanje identitete kočevskih Nemcev. Diplomsko delo, Univerza v Ljubljani, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Slovenia there are some families who preserved Gottscheerish in spite of the ban after World War II. Today, however, there are probably no more children learning it as first language. Most Gottscheerish speakers live in [[Gottschee|Moschnitze valley]] (Črmošnjiško-Poljanska dolina) between [[Kočevske Poljane]] and [[Črmošnjice, Semič|Črmošnjice]], where some Gottscheer families collaborated with the [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan movement]] and therefore were allowed to stay.&lt;ref name="tscherne" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmk20&gt;[http://www.pmk-kocevje.si/media/pdf/nemski_jezikovni_otok/pdf/20.pdf Pokrajinski muzej Kočevje: Vsi niso odšli / Not all of them left] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402185328/http://www.pmk-kocevje.si/media/pdf/nemski_jezikovni_otok/pdf/20.pdf |date=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Written representation==
As a primarily or exclusively spoken language, the written representation of Gottscheerish has varied considerably. The following table shows how some of the more problematic phonemes have been represented in different writing systems.

The symbol ''[[ə]]'' for [[schwa]] is frequently distorted in representations of Gottscheerish, incorrectly replaced by the partial differential symbol [[∂]] or umlauted ''[[ä]]''.

==Phonology==
{{Expand section|date=September 2012}}
The phonological inventory of Gottscheerish differs from standard German in a number of ways, especially regarding palatal consonants. The phonological inventory here is based on Hans Tschinkel's 1908 grammar.&lt;ref name = "Tschinkel"/&gt; Tschinkel does not explicitly distinguish between phonemic and phonetic status.

===Consonants===
Consonants in parentheses are either phonetic/positional variants, [[idiolect]] variants, or dialect variants.&lt;ref&gt;Tschinkel, Hans. 1908. ''Grammatik der Gottscheer Mundart.'' Halle: Max Niemeyer, pp. 20–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the westernmost part of Gottschee, known as the Suchen Plateau ({{lang-de|Suchener Hochtal}}), the phonemes /s/ and /ʃ/ merged to yield /ɕ/ and the phonemes /z/ and /ʒ/ merged to yield /ʑ/.&lt;ref&gt;Tschinkel, Hans. 1908.

===Vowels===
Tschinkel gives a large vowel inventory for Gottscheerish, especially for [[diphthong|vowel clusters]]. He does not strictly distinguish between phonemic and phonetic values.&lt;ref&gt;Tschinkel, Hans. 1908. ''Grammatik der Gottscheer Mundart.'' Halle: Max Niemeyer, pp. 12–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hispania''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] and the official journal of the [[American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aatsp.org/?page=History |title=The History of the AATSP - AATSP |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published quarterly by the AATSP and covers [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[literature]], [[linguistics]], and [[pedagogy]]. ''Hispania'' publishes in literature, linguistics, and pedagogy having to do with Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking communities, as well as book/media reviews, which are subdivided into Pan-Hispanic/[[Portuguese Brazilian|Luso-Brazilian]] Literary and Cultural Studies, linguistics, language, media, and fiction and film.

==History==
The first publication of ''Hispania'' dates to the earliest days of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese and the first issue featured a summation of the possibilities of the new organization, written by Lawrence Wilkins, as well as an outline of future plans for the journal written by its founding [[editor in chief]], Aurelio M. Espinosa ([[Stanford University]]).&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;Walsh, Donald Devenish. Hispania, Vol. 50, No. 4, Fiftieth Anniversary Number (Dec. 1967) p. 823-833&lt;/ref&gt; In the outline, Espinosa defined the journal's chief aim as "the betterment of the teaching of Spanish in our schools and colleges".&lt;ref&gt;Espinosa, Aurelio. Hispania, Vol. 1, Organization Number (Nov., 1917) p. 19-23&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, ''Hispania'''s original subtitle was "A Journal Devoted to the Interests of Teachers of Spanish," which reflected the earnest pedagogic tone and content of its first volumes.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; In keeping with his vision of the journal's purpose, Espinosa published more pedagogical material than any of his successors: fully 64 percent of the articles in the nine volumes he edited were pedagogical in nature.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt;

Alfred Coester succeeded Espinosa as editor, a position he held for the next 14 years. During his tenure the journal grew significantly in scope and readership, adding new sections, such as the "Professional Literature" section devoted to reviewing pedagogical articles and books.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; In 1941, a report of the Committee on General Policies led to a revision of ''Hispania'''s scope by recommending among others that its "contents should strike a balance between material of interest to secondary teachers and articles primarily of interest to university members".&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; Further revisions called for more articles on Spanish in elementary schools, on relations with Hispanic America, and on attitudes of personal educators toward the teaching of Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt;

Henry Grattan Doyle succeeded Coester in 1942. Doyle had been editor of the ''[[Modern Language Journal]]'' for four years before he became editor of ''Hispania''.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; Doyle instituted the anonymous peer review process that is still in place today. He also increased the number of articles dealing with Luso-Brazilian languages and literatures. Other additions Doyle made to the editorial process included assigning books for review and ceasing to accept unsolicited reviews.

The post [[World War II]] era was ushered in with a new editor, Donald Walsh, in 1949. Walsh is considered by many, including his successor, Robert Mead Jr., to have developed ''Hispania'' into the modern language journal it is today.&lt;ref name=Mead&gt;Mead, Robert G., Jr. Hispania, Vol. 75, No. 4, “The Quincentennial of the Columbian Era.” (Oct., 1992) p. 1083-1086.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mead/&gt; Walsh broke with the previous editors' focus on pedagogy by broadening ''Hispania'''s scope, diversifying its contents, adding new sections, soliciting contributions from colleagues known for their expertise, and making sure that every issue of the journal had something of practical use and pedagogical value to both the [[K-12 (education)|K-12 teacher]] and the [[postgraduate education|graduate]]-level professor.&lt;ref name=Mead/&gt; Walsh also instituted the change to a two-column format, which saved the journal space and money. He retired from the editorship in 1957.

Robert Meade, Jr. ([[University of Connecticut]]) became interim editor in 1958, having already served since 1953 as an associate editor. Meade reiterated the message that articles must be broad enough in scope to interest the more than 5,000 members, nearly half of whom taught in [[secondary school]]s.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; Meade served during a time of rapid growth within the profession due to increased interest in foreign language study as well as increased funding through the [[National Defense Education Act]] (instituted to keep pace with the former USSR in mathematics, science, and foreign languages).&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; Meade's editorial leadership increased the number of literary articles published in order to rectify an imbalance between the various sections.

Seymour Menton ([[University of Kansas]]) succeeded Meade in 1963. During his three-year tenure as editor, Menton also strove to rectify an imbalance in the journal's article ratio by calling for more literary contributions from members.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; He created a second book review section that focused on reviewing books of scholarly and literary interest, as opposed to the original one, which focused on textbook reviews.

Irving P. Rothberg, who had edited the book review section for nearly nine years prior, succeeded Menton in 1966 and served until 1974. He was in turn succeeded by Donald W. Bleznick, who instituted the inclusion of an editorial policy in each number of ''Hispania'' outlining what the journal would and would not accept for publication, a move intended to reduce the number of unwanted submissions.&lt;ref name=Don&gt;Bleznick, Donald W. Hispania, Vol. 75, No. 4, “The Quincentennial of the Columbian Era.” (Oct., 1992) p. 1083-1086.&lt;/ref&gt; Bleznick managed the journal during one of its most trying times, after a fire destroyed its printing facility in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]] in May 1979. He oversaw the reconstruction of the journal and found it a new publisher in time to have it in print again by 1980.&lt;ref name=Don/&gt;

Theodore A. Sackett became editor in 1984 and directed the journal through most the 1980s. Sackett added "Pedagogy" as a special section in ''Hispania'' in order to address the changing face of the classroom that resulted from the advent of computers and the new concern for communicative competence.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, Raquel. Hispania, Vol. 82, No. 2 (May, 1999), p.293-297.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Estelle Irizarry in 1993. During her editorship, ''Hispania'' became the first journal in the humanities to digitalize and produce a [[Compact disc|CD]] of articles dating from its inception in 1917 through 1990, a project for which members volunteered to prepare issues or volumes. Irizarry also improved efficiency and reduced decision time. Under her tenure, the journal was awarded second place for the "Phoenix Award for Significant Editorial Achievement" from the [[Council of Editors of Learned Journals]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=award&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.celj.org/winners |title=Winners &amp;#124; The Council of Editors of Learned Journals |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janet Pérez assumed the editorship in 2000. Her final term ended in 2009. The end of her editorship coincided with her induction as a permanent member of the [[North American Academy of the Spanish Language]] at a ceremony at the [[Instituto Cervantes]] in [[New York City]].

Sheri Spaine Long, the former editor of ''[[Foreign Language Annals]]'', succeeded Pérez as Editor in January 2010. Concurrently, [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] became the publisher of the journal. Long’s editorship ended in 2018.

Benjamin Fraser began as Editor of the journal in 2018.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ibrahim saeed.jpg|thumbnail|right|Ibrahim Saeed]] --&gt;
'''Ibrahim Saeed''', sometimes spelled as Sayeed (20 May 1945 – 27 May 2007), was an Indian writer and publisher. 

After returning from his second [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], he relinquished the presidency of Jamat-e-Islami, which he had held from 2003 to 2006. For a decade he served as a member of the national representative body of Jamat-e-Islami Hind in [[Delhi]]. Saeed was one of founders of Shanthi Prakashana and later he became chairman of this publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicvoice.com/november.99/community.htm Islamic Voice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholar and orator==
Saeed is known to the people of Karnataka state not merely as a journalist but also as a thinker, an intellectual and a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhatkallys.com/news/news.asp?AID=3879 Welcome to Bhatkallys&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was an orator who traveled widely in Karnataka giving lectures on various topics including communal harmony, character building and moral values, as well as the significance of democracy in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milligazette.com/dailyupdate/2004/20041217.htm PEACE for everyone – International Exhibition on Islam &amp; Peace in Bangalore, The Milli Gazette, India Muslim Media News : Print&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Da’wah]] is another field he had taken up to his heart during his lifetime and had composed several Da’wah related books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahilonline.org/english/coastalnews.asp?nid=3072&amp;sid=185639369 SahilOnline English Daily – Reflection of the TRUTH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Plenty of his Kannada and [[Urdu]] speeches have come out in form of audio cassettes as well. He did voice recording for the first ever Kannada translation of the [[Qur’an]] in electronic format. The multilingual Saeed is fluent in Kannada, Urdu and English. He has studied Arabic and Malayalam languages privately.&lt;ref&gt;http://justsamachar.com/local/path-of-good-faith/&lt;/ref&gt; He used to hold his weekly Qur'an discourse sessions in Kannada and also in [[Beary bashe]], a dialect used by the Indian [[Beary]] community live alongside coastal Karnataka.

==Contribution to communal harmony==
Saeed firmly believed that most of the mistrust between the followers of Islam and of other religions springs from the lack of knowledge about each other’s faith. He was a student of comparative religions and tried to remove mistrust and bring people of various religions closer through his translations, writings and speeches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/06/01/stories/2007060151290300.htm The Hindu : Friday Review Bangalore / Tribute : Path of good faith&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary life==
One work, ''Tappu kalpanegalu'', was reprinted nine times. It earned him prominence in the neighboring states of Karnataka when it was translated into English, [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. He had also rendered services as chairman of Shanti Prakashana, a publishing company based in Mangalore city.

His work ''Mahakavi Iqbalara kavanagalu'' is an attempt to transform thoughts and philosophy of [[Allama Iqbal]] into Kannada language which he had started to pen down in his popular weekly, ''Sanmarga''. Shanti Prakashana, of which he was chairman, later brought  it out in book form. This is the first major work in Kannada as regard to Sir Allama Iqbal’s poetry or philosophy is concerned.

Ibrahim Saeed also served on the translation board of ''Divya Qur’an'' and ''Qur’an Vyakhyana''. The former is a translation and the latter is commentary ([[Tafsir]]) work of the Qur’an in Kannada. ''Qur’an Vyakhyana'' is an abridged version of [[Towards Understanding the Qur'an]], the renowned [[Qur’an]] exegesis. He has enormously contributed to bring out Kannada Translation of Qur'an in audio cassettes and later in CD form.

''Pravadi Jeevana Sandesha'' is a biography of [[Muhammad]] with proper citations and reference sources.

Ibrahim Saeed was a columnist in ''[[Prajavani]]'', the largest published Kannada daily of Karnataka. In Prajavani he wrote under nom de plume ''Sanmargi.''.

'''Shamsun Nahar Iffat Ara''' ({{lang-bn|(ইফ্‌ফাত আরা}}), known as '''Iffat Ara''', is a writer, social activist and literary organizer of [[Bangladesh]]. Her literary career began in late 1950s when she started to write short stories and publish them in the leading newspaper of the country including the ''[[The Azad|Azad]]''. She continues to write defying her age and broken health.

== Life and education ==

Iffat Ara was born to Maulavi Quazi Abdul Hakim and Mosammat Hajera Khatun in [[Mymensingh]] town in 1939. She struggled hard for formal education, first learning Arabic at home to be able to read the [[Quran]]. She then went to Muslim Girls' School for primary education. After her primary education was over, her father withdrew her from the school since, at that time, higher education for girls was not considered necessary.&lt;ref name="thedailystar.net"&gt;{{cite web |last=Islam  |first=Aminul |date=1 February 2007 |title=Iffat Ara: Writing from the Margins |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/starinsight/2007/02/01/she.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210013808/http://www.thedailystar.net/starinsight/2007/02/01/she.htm |archive-date=10 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desperate to continue education, she threatened to commit [[suicide]] and was subsequently admitted to the [[Vidyamoyee Uccha Balika Bidyalaya|Vidyamoyee Govt. Girls' High School]] of the town. But before she could complete the high school she was married to Abdul Latif Talukder, a young lawyer and politician. Luckily it was a short interruption and she could appear in the [[Matriculate]] examination the next year. Later, she passed Intermediate from the [[Muminunnesa Women's College]]. In 1966 she graduated from the same college and proceeded to study for B. Ed. at the Mymensingh Women's Teachers Training College. When [[Ananda Mohan College]] was upgraded to a university-college, Iffat Ara lost no time to get admitted for her [[Master's degree|Masters]] in [[Bengali language]] and literature.

== Personality and philosophy ==

To her, life is work, work is life. She believes in women freedom but does not think marriage is a stumbling block on the way. She is religious and believes that [[Islam]] does not stand on the way for [[Muslim]] women to live a modern life. A very hospitable lady, Iffat Ara is near and dear to many in Mymensingh. She has mothered three children with utmost care and success. At her residence in Mymensingh town, she passes her time through writing, gardening and entertaining young authors and literary workers.

== Women's movements ==

Women's movements in Mymensingh could not be thought of without the active presence of Iffat Ara since the 1960s. She became involved in social welfare activities for women with her membership of [[All Pakistan Women's Association]] in 1966. After birth of [[Bangladesh]] in 1971, she, in association with others like author [[Helena Khan]], Sufia Karim and politician [[Mariam Hashimuddin]] took initiative to set up ''Mahila Samity'' (tr. Women's Association). Later she organized the Mymensingh chapter of the Bangladesh Jatiyo Mahila Sangtha, an organization sponsored by the government. She contributed substantially in establishing Udayan High School in Mymensingh in 1988. Since her marriage she was in touch with politics but never opted for joining politics.

== Professional career ==

In 1968, Iffat Ara joined Nasirabad Girls' School as an assistant teacher and retired from there as its headmistress in 1972. Later she took up the job of feature editor for the women's page of the weekly ''[[Banglar Darpan]]'' published from Mymensingh. When the same establishment started to publish a monthly women's magazine, titled ''Chandrakash'', in 1973, Iffat Ara was appointed its editor. She worked as editor of ''Chandrakash'' till 1979.

== Publications ==
Iffat Ara has published nine titles to her credit. They include novels, a collection of short stories, a book of knowledge for children and essays. She also edited ''Bangladesher Jonopriyo Kavita'' (tr. Popular poems from Bangladesh), a collection of [[Bengali language|Bengali]] poems since the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1999 |title=Lekhok Obidhan |script-title=লেখক অভিধান |trans-title=Author Dictionary |location=Dhaka |publisher=Bangla Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her unique book of knowledge for high school goers ''Shona achey jana nai'' was highly acclaimed and has gone through many editions since 1990. Her novel ''Sukh jakhan shesh belay'' was published in 2000. Currently she is working on a book of short stories for young readers.

== ''Dwitiyo Chinta'' ==

She set up a press in her house and started to publish a literary monthly magazine ''Chinta'' in 1986. Later it was renamed ''[[Dwitiyo Chinta]]'' in 1988. Soon ''Iffat Mansion'', her residence in Mymensingh town since 1960, from where she published her magazine, became a hub of literary activities. The poet [[Jibanananda Das]] birth centenary edition of the ''Dwitiyo Chinta'', brought out in 1999, remains an example of high quality editing and planning of a commemorative issue of a magazine. ''Dwitiyo Chinta'' has published writings of many eminent writers and poets of the country in addition to regional writers.&lt;ref name="thedailystar.net"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4265">An '''information disclosure statement''' (often abbreviated as '''IDS''') refers to a submission of relevant background art or information to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) by an applicant for a [[patent]] during the [[patent prosecution]] process.  There is a duty on all patent applicants to disclose relevant art or background information that the applicant is aware of and that may be relevant to the [[patentability]] of the applicant's invention, as established by the [[United States Code]] title 35 and related sections of 37 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] and the [[Manual of Patent Examining Procedure]] (MPEP).  If a patent applicant, with deceptive intent for art known to the applicant, fails to submit material prior art to the USPTO, then any patent that later issues from the patent application may be declared unenforceable because of [[inequitable conduct]].  Furthermore, the duty to submit such relevant information to the USPTO lies not only on the applicant or inventor, but also on any [[patent attorney]] or other legal staff employed by the applicant.

Art listed on an IDS, on its own, is not automatically considered [[prior art]]. "Mere listing of a reference in an information disclosure statement is not taken as an admission that the reference is prior art against the claims."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/2100_2129.htm MPEP 2129 IV], citing Riverwood Int'l Corp. v. R.A. Jones &amp; Co., 324 F.3d 1346, 1354-55, 66 USPQ2d 1331, 1337-38 (Fed Cir. 2003) and 37 CFR  1.97(h).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The information submitted in an IDS typically includes other issued patents, published patent applications, [[scientific journal]] articles, books, magazine articles, or any other published material that is relevant to the invention disclosed in the applicant's own patent application, irrespective of the country or language in which the published material was made.

Art listed on an IDS is typically broken up into three categories: U.S. patent literature, foreign patent literature, and [[non-patent literature]] (NPL).  US patent literature consists of issued U.S. patents and U.S. patent application publications.  Copies of listed U.S. patent literature do not need to be submitted along with the IDS as USPTO examiners have access to all U.S. patent literature.  Foreign patent literature consists of patents issued in foreign countries, foreign application publications if they exist, and [[Patent Cooperation Treaty|PCT]] international application publications.  Non-patent literature consists of any publication that is not a U.S. or foreign patent publication, such as magazine articles or research journals.  Copies of listed non-patent literature (NPL) and foreign patent publications need to be submitted along with the IDS or they will not be considered by USPTO examiners. If the copies of NPL or foreign patent publications are not in the English language, the applicant must also submit an English translation or a summary of relevancy in the English language in order for the piece of art to be considered by the examiner.

The content requirements of an IDS are defined in [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s609.html 37 CFR 1.98], which can be found in the MPEP.

==Submission requirements==
The submission requirements of an IDS are defined in [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s609.html 37 CFR 1.97], also found in the MPEP, and include when and how the applicant is allowed to submit information disclosure statements.  An IDS is not permitted in a [[provisional application]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxr_1_51.htm#cfr37s1.51 37 CFR §1.51]&lt;/ref&gt;  As of October 2006, relevant art may be submitted on paper using a USPTO-issued form, or electronically using the USPTO's electronic filing system.

[[File:Sverigekarta-Landskap Jämtland.svg|thumb|150px|Jämtland in northern Sweden]]

'''Jämtland dialects''' (''jamska'' {{IPA-xx|ˈjamskɐ|}}, Swedish: ''jämtska'') constitute a group of closely related [[dialect]]s spoken in the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[provinces of Sweden|province]] of [[Jämtland]]. They are commonly used in the entire region, with the exception of [[Frostviken]] in the northernmost part of the province, where the local dialect is of [[trøndersk]] origin, due to its later settlement from Norway. In the eastern part of Jämtland the dialects are transitional to those of [[Ångermanland]]. The dialect group is commonly regarded and treated as a single entity. Some people consider it a language separate from Swedish. 

Jamtlandic shares many characteristics with both Trøndersk—the dialect spoken in [[Trøndelag]], Norway—and with the dialects spoken along the coast of Norrland, Sweden. Due to this ambiguous position, there has been a debate since the early 20th century whether Jamtlandic belongs to the [[West Norse]] or the [[East Norse]] language group. Jamtlandic cannot be uniquely defined belonging to either of these groups. Prior to, and around, the time of the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|dissolution]] of the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Swedish–Norwegian union]], Jamtlandic was undisputedly considered a dialect of Norwegian. See, e.g., p.&amp;nbsp;112 in part one of [[Adolf Noreen|Adolf Noreen's]] ''Vårt språk'' (translated from Swedish):
:''The Westnorthern Swedish ("Norwegian-Swedish"), originally Norwegian dialects in Särna and Idre (the northwesternmost Dalarna), Härjedalen and Jämtland (where, though, the language east of Östersund eventually passes into Medelpadian or Ångermanlandic).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Noreen
|first=Adolf
|title=Vårt språk
|publisher=
|year=1908}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The local name for the dialects is ''jamska'', whose literal equivalent in English would be ''Jamtish'' or ''Jämtish''. There is, however, no common term for the dialects in English, and academic sources call them by various names, such as ''jamska'', ''jämtska'', ''Jämtish dialect'', ''Jämtlandic dialect'', ''Jämtland dialects'' or ''dialects of Jämtland''.

The endonym ''jamska'' is technically a definite form; the indefinite form ''jaamsk/jamske'' is rarely used.

==Language==
Since the early 20th century, whether Jamtlandic is a [[dialect]] or a [[language]] has been hotly debated. Proponents of Jamtlandic as a language point to the differences in vocabulary and pronunciation. A great percentage of the Jamtish speakers recognise Jamtish as a language rather than a Swedish dialect.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} There have been efforts to make the Swedish government recognise it as a [[minority languages of Sweden|minority language]] just as [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Sami language|Sami]]. One of the more prominent people that have been active in the effort to make Jamtish a recognised language is Bo Oscarsson.  Oscarsson has written books about the Jamtish language/dialect and even compiled dictionaries.

==History==
According to the [[Norse saga|sagas]], the region called Jämtland was originally settled by fugitives from Trøndelag after [[Harald I of Norway|Harald Fairhair]] united Norway in the 9th century. It became part of Norway during the reign of [[Haakon I of Norway|Haakon I]] in the 10th century and remained part of Norway until the 17th century. At that point it became part of Sweden. The history of the region accounts for many of the dialect's features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Gjerset
|first=Knut
|title=History of the Norwegian People, Volumes I &amp; II
|publisher=The MacMillan Company
|year=1915}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to the trace the history of Jamtlandic dialects because written sources only exist from the early 18th century, if not including the early 11th century [[Frösö Runestone|Frösö runestone]] or the 14th century legal documents which can not be confirmed to have been written in Old Jamtlandic, the assumed distinct Jamtlandic dialect of Old West Norse.

== Orthography ==
There have been attempts to standardize the orthography of Jamtlandic. The attempt that has been the most popular is ''Vägledning för stavning av jamska'' (1994 and 1995) which is the work of the committee ''Akademien för jamska'' consisting of Bodil Bergner, Berta Magnusson and Bo Oscarsson. The most prominent application of this orthography has been to prepare translations of parts of the [[Bible]] into Jamtlandic resulting in the book ''Nagur Bibelteksta på jamska''. An excerpt:

'''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:26–27''':
:&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;''Å Gud saa: ’Lätt oss gjära når mänish, nager som e lik oss. Å dom ske rå öve fishn derri havan å över foglan pyne himmela, å öve tamdjura öve heile jola, å öve all de djur som kravl å rör se på jorn.´

:&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;''Å Gud skapa mänishan å gjool som n avbild ta se själv. Te kær å kviin skapa n dom.''

It should be emphasized that the book does not fully follow ''Vägledning för stavning av jamska''. For example, using ''Vägledning för stavning av jamska'' one would spell ''gjæra'' v. 'do; make', not "gjära". Another spelling convention in ''Nagur Bibelteksta på jamska'' is the use of the digraph "sh", in e.g. "mänish" n. 'human being' and "fishn" n. 'the fish', with the same pronunciation as English 'sh' in 'shoe'. Properly using ''Vägledning för stavning av jamska'', this would be spelled ''sch''; see § 26 in the external link below.

Jamtlandic uses the letters of the [[Swedish alphabet]], with the addition of '''æ''' and '''ô'''. The letters '''c''', '''q''', '''w''', '''x''', and '''z''' are not used in the Jamtlandic alphabet.

The '''Karirí languages''', generally considered dialects of a single language, are [[extinct language]]s formerly spoken by the [[Kiriri people]] of [[Brazil]]. It was spoken until the middle of the 20th century; the 4,000 ethnic Kiriri are now monolingual Portuguese speakers, though a few know common phrases and names of medicinal plants.

The four known Kariri languages are:
*[[Kipeá language|Kipeá]] (Quipea, Kariri)
*[[Kamurú language|Kamurú]] (Camuru)
*[[Dzubukuá language|Dzubukuá]] (Dzubucua, Kiriri)
*[[Sabujá language|Sabujá]] (Sapoyá, Pedra Branca).
There are short grammatical descriptions of Kipeá and Dzubukuá, and word lists for Kamurú and Sabujá. Ribeiro established through morphological analysis that Kariri is likely to be related to the [[Jê languages]].

==Other languages called 'Kariri'==
The names ''Kariri'' and ''Kiriri'' were applied to many peoples over a wide area in the east of Brazil, in the lower and middle [[São Francisco River]] area and further north. Most of their now-extinct languages are too poorly known to classify, but what is recorded does not suggest that they were all members of the Kariri family. Examples are:
*[[Katembri language|Katembri]] (''Kiriri, Kariri, Kariri de Mirandela'' [near [[Banzaê]] &amp; [[Quijingue]]])
**Kaufman (1990) classified it as [[Katembri–Taruma languages|Katembri–Taruma]]. 
*[[Xukuru language|Xukurú]] (''Kirirí, Kirirí-Xokó'' [in [[Pernambuco]]])
**Loukotka (1968) says this forms a [[Xukuru languages|small family]] with [[Paratió language|Paratió]]. 
*[[Xocó language|Xocó]] (''Xokó, Chocó'' [in [[Sergipe]]], ''Kariri-Xocó, Kariri-Shoko, Cariri-Chocó'' [in [[Alagoas]]], ''Xukuru-Kariri, Xucuru-Kariri, Xucuru-Cariri'' [in [[Alagoas]]])
**Three populations. Not clear if this was one language or three.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5021">'''Kuno Lorenz''' (born September 17, 1932  in [[Vachdorf]], [[Thuringia|Thüringen]]) is a [[Germans|German]] [[philosopher]]. He developed a philosophy of dialogue, in connection with the pragmatic theory of action of the [[Erlangen]] [[constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] school. Lorenz is married to the literary scholar [[Karin Lorenz-Lindemann]].

== Career ==

After studying mathematics and physics in [[Tübingen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Bonn]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]], Lorenz earned his  Ph.D. in 1961 under [[Paul Lorenzen]] in [[Kiel]] with a thesis about ''Arithmetic and Logic as Games''. In 1969 he received his [[habilitation]] degree in [[philosophy]] also under Lorenzen but this time in [[Erlangen]]. In 1970 he was offered the chair of philosophy at the University of Hamburg to succeed [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]. From 1974 till his retirement in 1997 he taught at the University of Saarland in Saarbrücken. Among his former students is [[Arno Ros]].

== Dialogue and predication ==
Lorenz developed (along with [[Paul Lorenzen]]) an approach to arithmetic and logic as dialogue games. In dialogical logic ([[game semantics]]), tree calculations (generally, of Gentzen type calculus) are written upside down, so  that the initial assertion of a proponent stays above and is defended against an opponent as in a game. This is a linguistically more congenial approach to logic which is more suitable as a model for argumentation than the formal derivation in a calculus or truth tables. Lorenz presented for the first time a simple demonstration of [[Gentzen's consistency proof]] on this game-theoretic basis. If one regards logic and mathematics in this way as a game, an intuitionist approach becomes a more plausible option.

== Dialogical constructivism ==

Not only logic, but the whole of philosophy is given a dialogical treatment by Lorenz. Only in the mirror of a relative Other is it possible to reflect upon oneself. Lorenz developed a dialogical constructivism from the focus on the dialogical principle (Martin Buber) and the process of language games of the later Ludwig Wittgenstein. In addition, the pragmatism of Charles Sanders Peirce and the historicism of Wilhelm Dilthey are complementary juxtaposed.

'''Lamba''' is a language found in [[Zambia]] and is commonly spoken in the [[Copperbelt]]. There are about 210,000 native speakers in the northern parts of Zambia and southern fringes of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Lamba is also spoken in [[Lusaka]], mainly because many speakers have migrated there for jobs. Lamba is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]]. (In fact, "mu ntu" means "one person" in Lamba and "ba ntu" means "two or more people".) Depending on who does the counting, Zambia has between 42 and 78 local languages besides [[English language|English]] – see [[Languages of Zambia]] for further details. Some people might say Lamba is a dialect of Bemba. Though the two languages share many words, they are not as close as say [[Cockney]] and [[Haitian Creole]] are to English or French.

Maho (2009) lists the Lima (''Bulima'') and Temba varieties as distinct languages.

There are 88 individual languages of Ethiopia according to [[Ethnologue]],&lt;ref name="Ethnet"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=ET ''Ethnologue'' page on Ethiopian languages]&lt;/ref&gt; with the 1994 Ethiopian census indicating that some 77 tongues were spoken locally. Most of these languages belong to the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family ([[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Cushitic languages]]; [[Omotic languages]] are also spoken, though their classification is uncertain). Additionally, [[Nilo-Saharan languages]] are spoken by what the government calls the [[Nilotic peoples|"Nilotic"]] people, though scholars distinguish Nilotic from the [[Surmic languages]], [[Gumuz languages]], and [[Koman languages]] and spoken in Ethiopia.

Of the languages spoken in Ethiopia, 86 are living and 2 are extinct. 41 of the living languages are institutional, 14 are developing, 18 are vigorous, 8 are in danger of extinction, and 5 are near extinction.&lt;ref name="Ethnet"/&gt;

[[Charles A. Ferguson]] proposed the [[Ethiopian language area]], characterized by shared grammatical and phonological features in 1976. This ''[[sprachbund]]'' includes the Afroasiatic languages of Ethiopia, not the Nilo-Saharan languages. In 2000, [[Mauro Tosco]] questioned the validity of Ferguson's original proposal. There is still no agreement among scholars on this point, but Tosco has at least weakened Ferguson's original claim.

[[English language|English]] is the most widely spoken foreign language and is the [[medium of instruction]] in secondary schools and universities. [[Amharic]] was the language of primary school instruction but has been replaced in many areas by local languages such as [[Oromo language|Oromo]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]].

After the fall of the [[Derg]] in 1991, the [[1995 Constitution of Ethiopia]] granted all ethnic groups the right to develop their languages and to establish [[first language]] [[primary education]] systems. This is a marked change to the language policies of previous [[Politics of Ethiopia|governments in Ethiopia]].

In terms of [[writing system]]s, Ethiopia's principal orthography is the [[Ge'ez script]]. Employed as an [[abugida]] for several of the country's languages, it first came into usage in the sixth and fifth centuries BC as an [[abjad]] to transcribe the Semitic [[Ge'ez language]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo Fattovich, "Akkälä Guzay" in Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C''. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz KG, 2003, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Ge'ez now serves as the liturgical language of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]es. Other writing systems have also been used over the years by different Ethiopian communities. These include Arabic script for writing some Ethiopian languages spoken by Muslim populations&lt;ref&gt;(Alula Pankurst|Pankhurst, Alula]].

===Nilo-Saharan===
In Ethiopia, the term "[[Nilotic]]" is often used to refer to Nilo-Saharan languages and their communities. However, in academic linguistics, "Nilotic" is only part of "Nilo-Saharan", a segment of the larger Nilo-Saharan family.

==Endangered languages==
A number of Ethiopian languages are endangered: they may not be spoken in one or two generations and may become extinct, victims of [[language death]], as [[Weyto language|Weyto]], [[Gafat language|Gafat]], and [[Mesmes language|Mesmes]] have and Ongota very soon will.  The factors that contribute to language death are complex, so it is not easy to estimate which or how many languages are most vulnerable.  Hudson wrote, "Assuming that a language with fewer than 10,000 speakers is endangered, or likely to become extinct within a generation", there are 22 endangered languages in Ethiopia (1999:96).  However, a number of Ethiopian languages never have had populations even that high, so it is not clear that this is an appropriate way to calculate the number of endangered languages in Ethiopia.  The real number may be lower or higher.  The new language policies after the 1991 revolution have strengthened the use of a number of languages.  Publications specifically about endangered languages in Ethiopia include: Appleyard (1998), Hayward (1988), Zelealem (1998a,b, 2004)

The '''Middle Indo-Aryan languages''' (or '''Middle Indic languages''', sometimes conflated with the [[Prakrit]]s, which are a stage of Middle Indic) are a historical group of languages of the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan family]]. They are the descendants of [[Indo-Aryan languages#Old Indo-Aryan|Old Indo-Aryan]] (attested in [[Vedic Sanskrit]]) and the predecessors of the modern [[Indo-Aryan languages]], such as [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] (Hindi-Urdu), [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].

The Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA) stage in the evolution of Indo-Aryan languages is thought to have spanned more than a millennium between 600 BCE and 1000 CE, and is often divided into three major subdivisions.

* The early stage is represented by the [[Ardhamagadhi]] of the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] (c. 250 BC) and [[Jain Agamas]], and by the [[Pali]] of the [[Tripitaka]]s.
* The middle stage is represented by the various literary [[Prakrit]]s, especially the [[Shauraseni language]] and [[Maharashtri Prakrit|Maharashtri]] and [[Magadhi Prakrit]]s. The term Prakrit is also often applied to Middle Indo-Aryan languages (''prākṛta'' literally means "natural" as opposed to ''saṃskṛta'', which literally means "constructed" or "refined"). Modern scholars such as Michael C. Shapiro follow this classification by including all Middle Indo-Aryan languages under the rubric of "Prakrits", while others emphasise the independent development of these languages, often separated from  [[Sanskrit]] by social and geographic differences.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Michael C. ''Hindi.'' &lt;u&gt;Facts about the world's languages: An encyclopedia of the world's major languages, past and present.&lt;/u&gt; Ed. Jane Garry, and Carl Rubino: New England Publishing Associates, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The late stage is represented by the [[Apabhraṃśa]]s of the 6th century and later that preceded early [[Indo-Aryan languages#Modern Indo-Aryan|Modern Indo-Aryan]] languages&lt;ref&gt;Bubenik, Vit (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OtCPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA204 "Chapter Six: Prākrits and Apabhraṃśa"]. In Jain, Danesh; Cardona, George. ''The Indo-Aryan Languages''. Routledge. p. 209. {{ISBN|978-1-135-79711-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro, Hindi"&gt;Shapiro, ''Hindi.''&lt;/ref&gt; (such as [[Braj Bhasha]]).

==History==
The [[Indo-Aryan languages]] are commonly assigned to three major groups - Old Indo-Aryan languages, Middle Indo-Aryan languages and Early Modern and Modern Indo-Aryan languages. The classification reflects stages in linguistic development, rather than being strictly chronological.&lt;ref name="Oberlies2007" /&gt;

The Middle Indo-Aryan languages are younger than the Old Indo-Aryan languages&lt;ref&gt;"The most archaic Old Indo-Aryan is found in Hindu sacred texts called the Vedas, which date to approximately 1500 BCE". Encyclopædia Britannica - Indo-Aryan languages. General characteristics.&lt;/ref&gt; but were contemporaneous with the use of Classical Sanskrit, an Old Indo-Aryan language used for literary purposes.&lt;ref&gt;"If in "Sanskrit" we include the Vedic language and all dialects of the Old Indian period, then it is true to say that all the Prakrits are derived from Sanskrit. If on the other
hand " Sanskrit " is used more strictly of the Panini-Patanjali language or "Classical Sanskrit," then it is untrue to say that any Prakrit is derived from Sanskrit, except that S'auraseni, the Midland Prakrit, is derived from the Old Indian dialect". Introduction to Prakrit, by Alfred C Woolner. Baptist Mission Press 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thomas Oberlies, a number of morphophonological and lexical features of Middle Indo-Aryan languages show that they are not direct continuations of [[Vedic Sanskrit]]. Instead they descend from other dialects similar to, but in some ways more archaic than Vedic Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="Oberlies2007"&gt;Oberlies, Thomas (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OtCPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161 "Chapter Five: Aśokan Prakrit and Pāli"]. In Jain, Danesh; Cardona, George. ''The Indo-Aryan Languages''. Routledge. p. 163. {{ISBN|978-1-135-79711-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early phase: 3rd century BCE===
*Ashokan Prakrits (3rd century BCE; regional dialects)
* [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhari]] (a Buddhist canonical language)
*Pali (a Buddhist canonical language)
*early Ardha Magadhi (language of the oldest Jain sutras)

===Middle phase (200 BCE to 700 CE)===
*Niya Prakrit
*Ardha Magadhi (later Jain canon)
*[[Dramatic Prakrit]]s ([[Maurya Empire|Maurya period]])
**Maharashtri
**Magadhi
**Sauraseni
*[[Elu]]
*[[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit]] (later texts)

===Late phase: Apabhramsa (700-1500)===
*[[Abahatta]] (Magadhi Apabhramsa)
*Elu

==Innovation==
A Middle Indo-Aryan innovation are the [[serial verb construction]]s that have evolved into [[complex predicate]]s in modern north [[India]]n languages such as [[Hindi]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. For example, भाग जा (bhāg jā) 'go run' means run away, पका ले (pakā le) 'take cook' means to cook for oneself, and पका दे (pakā de) 'give cook' means to cook for someone. The second verb restricts the meaning of the main verb or adds a shade of meaning to it.&lt;ref name="Shapiro, Hindi"/&gt;  Subsequently, the second verb was [[grammaticalisation|grammaticalised]] further into what is known as a [[light verb]],
mainly used to convey [[lexical aspect]] distinctions for the main verb. The innovation is based on Sanskrit atmanepadi (fruit of the action accrues to the doer) and parasmaipadi verbs (fruit of the action accrues to some other than the doer). For example, पका दे (pakā de) 'give cook' has the result of the action (cooked food) going to someone else, and पका ले (pakā le) 'take cook' to the one who is doing the cooking.

===Pāli===
{{Main article|Pali}}

Pali is the best attested of the Middle Indo-Aryan languages because of the extensive writings of early Buddhists. These include canonical texts, canonical developments such as [[Abhidhamma]], and a thriving commentarial tradition associated with figures such as [[Buddhaghosa]]. Early Pāli texts, such as the Sutta-nipāta contain many "Magadhisms" (such as ''heke'' for ''eke''; or masculine nominative singular in ''-e''). Pāli continued to be a living [[second language]] until well into the second millennium. The [[Pali Text Society]] was founded in 1881 by [[Thomas William Rhys Davids|T. W. Rhys Davids]] to preserve, edit, and publish texts in Pāli, as well as English translations.

===Ardhamāgadhī===
{{main article|Jain Prakrit}}
Known from a few inscriptions, most importantly the pillars and edicts of [[Ashoka]] found in what is now [[Bihar]].&lt;ref&gt;South Asian folklore: an encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, By Peter J. Claus, Sarah Diamond, Margaret Ann Mills, Routledge, 2003, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gāndhārī===
{{main article|Gāndhārī language}}
Many texts in [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhi]] script have been discovered in the area centred on the [[Khyber Pass]] in what was known in ancient times as [[Gandhara]] and the language of the texts came to be called Gāndhārī. These are largely Buddhist texts which parallel the Pāli Canon, but include Mahāyāna texts as well. The language is distinct from other MI dialects.

===Apabhramsa===
An '''apabhramsa''' (also: '''avahatta''') was a language developed from Prakrits.&lt;ref&gt;BPT Vagish Shastri, Bundelkhand Ki Prachinta, Vidvad Gosthi, 1965, Varanasi, India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Devendra Kumar Jain, Apabhramsa Bhasa aur Sahitya, Bhartiya Jnanapitha Prakashan, 1966, Calcutta, India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.D.Gune, An Introduction to Comparative Philology, Poona Oriental BookHouse, 1959, Poona, India.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Provincial languages developed from different apabhramsas. [[Patanjali]] was the first to use the term apabhramsa in his [[Mahabhasya]] (200 BC). The term is derived from the Sanskrit word Apabhrasta,&lt;ref&gt;R.A.Pandey and R.N. Mishra, Pali Prakrat-Apabhramsa Sangraha, Vishwavidyalaya Prakashan, 1968, Varanasi, India&lt;/ref&gt; and means a corrupted form of [[Sanskrit]]. Mostly [[Jain]] religious language and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] literature of [[Siddhas]] was composed in Apabhramsa language. &lt;br/&gt;When the [[Romani people]] migrated from [[Rajasthan]], [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Sindh]] and [[Afghanistan]] in the 1st century AD, they were speaking an apabhramsa language pertaining to the Western part of India. They spread to Western countries around the 12th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Vagish Shastri, Gypsy language and grammar, Vol XXI, Yogic Voice Consciousness Institute, 2004, Varanasi, India&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apabhramsa poets====
Literary work in apabhramsa appeared in 8th century AD. Poets of apabhramsa are as follows:
# Svayambhu - his poem is Pauma Cariu

Her father was [[Cherokee]] and her mother Natchez, and she learned Natchez at home. She never learned English, but was trilingual in Natchez, [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] and [[Creek language|Creek]].&lt;ref name=Kimball/&gt;

In 1907 she worked a little with anthropologist [[John R. Swanton]] who collected information about Natchez religion, and in the 1930s she worked extensively with linguist [[Mary Haas]] who collected grammatical information and texts using an interpreter. Among the stories she told Mary Haas was one called "The Woman Who was a Fox".&lt;ref name=Kimball&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimball|first=G. |year=2013|title=The Woman Who Was a Fox: The Structure of a Natchez Oral Narrative|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=79|issue=3|pages=421–437|jstor=670925|doi=10.1086/670925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes she used the surname Taylor, which she had taken from her second husband.&lt;ref name=Kimball/&gt;

She married four times; she had one son Adam Levi from her first marriage, with her second husband Will Taylor she received land allotments from the [[Dawes Commission]] in 1907. She was soon widowed, then married a man named Waters, and by  1920 was again widowed and married Albert Raven about whom little is known. In the 1930s she appears to have been once again widowed. In 1930 she sold her land allotment.&lt;ref name=Kimball/&gt; She was the biological cousin of the other last speaker of Natchez, [[Watt Sam]], who in Natchez kinship terminology was her classificatory nephew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10418">'''Natural wine''' is wine made with minimal chemical and technological intervention, both in growing [[grape|grapes]] and making them into [[wine]]. The term is used to distinguish such wine from [[organic wine]] and [[biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic]] wine because of differences in cellar practices. All natural wines are, however, farmed organically at a minimum and many growers are biodynamic in the [[vineyard]] as well.

Strictly speaking, natural wines are wines that are produced without adding or removing anything during winemaking, although some growers add tiny quantities of [[sulfite|sulphites]] at bottling, so that strictly speaking their wines are not natural wines, but 'only' organic (and possibly biodynamic).

Organic wine is organic in the sense of having been produced from [[Organic farming|organically grown]] grapes, but may be subject to chemical and physical manipulation in the winemaking process.&lt;ref&gt;Breton, Félicien: [http://www.frenchscout.com/organic-wines Organic wines]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most influential personalities and ambassadors for natural wines is worth mentioning [[sommelier|sommeliers]] like Pierre Jancou (La Crémerie, Le bistrot Racines, Vivant and Heimat) and Ewen Le Moigne (Saturne) from Paris and Anders Frederik Steen (He worked as sommelier at the world-famous restaurant Noma, then joined Noma alums to form the highly acclaimed restaurant Relae and then Manfreds, both in Copenhagen.) Now Anders is a winemaker in Ardèche. Another influential name is Natural Wine World is Isabelle Legeron MW, France's only female Master of Wine and the only MW worldwide dedicated to the subject.

==Definitions==
At the present time (2013) there exists no official or legal definition of natural wine; neither has any legislation been passed to date by any regional, national or supranational authority, and there are no organizations that can certify that a wine is natural.

However, there are many unofficial definitions or codes of practice published by the different associations of natural wine producers:

* RAW WINE (UK, Germany, USA) [http://www.rawwine.com/]
* L´Association des Vins Naturels (France) [http://www.lesvinsnaturels.org/]
* Les Vins S.A.I.N.S (France) [http://vins-sains.org/category/La-charte/English]
* La Renaissance des Appellations (France) [http://renaissance-des-appellations.com/charte-de-qualite-renaissance-des-appellations/]

* Autentisté (Czech and Slovak Republic)
* Terra Hungarica (Hungary and Carpathian Basin) [http://terrahungarica.hu/]

Additionally, many articles have been written defining what is or is not natural wine given that there is no clear consensus or definition on the topic as of yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324436104578579650208883968|title=The Actual Facts Behind the Rise of Natural Wine|first=Lettie|last=Teague|date=11 July 2013|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decanter.com/people-and-places/wine-articles/529224/natural-wines|title=Wine News|website=Decanter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/dining/natural-wines-worth-a-taste-but-not-the-vitriol.html|title=Natural Wines Worth a Taste, but Not the Vitriol|first=Eric|last=Asimov|date=17 May 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/wine/8495189/Be-wary-at-the-Natural-Wine-Fair.html|title=Be wary at the Natural Wine Fair|first=Victoria|last=Moore|date=5 May 2011|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/pb/lifestyle/news/article.cfm|title=Lifestyle news, reviews, photos and video from New Zealand and around the world|publisher=|via=www.nzherald.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timatkin.com/articles?104|title=Tim Atkin MW - Articles - An agnostic's view of natural wines|first=Tim|last=Atkin|website=www.timatkin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decanter.com/people-and-places/wine-articles/529015/andrew-jefford-august-2011-column|title=Wine News|website=Decanter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
The following basic criteria are generally accepted by most natural wine producers and organizations:
* Organically or biodynamically grown grapes, with or without certification.
* Dry-farmed, low-yielding vineyards.
* Hand-picked.
* No added [[sugars (wine)|sugars]], no [https://vinepair.com/articles/wild-ferment-natural-wine/ cultivated (cultured) yeasts], no foreign bacteria.
* No adjustments for [[acidity (wine)|acidity]].
* No additives for color, mouth-feel, minerality, etc.
* No external flavor additives, including those derived from new [[oak (wine)|oak]] barrels, staves, chips, or liquid extract.
* Minimal or no [[fining (wine)|fining]] or [[filtration (wine)|filtration]].
* No heavy manipulation, such as [[micro-oxygenation]], [[reverse osmosis]], [[spinning cone]], [[cryoextraction]].
* Minimal or no added [[sulphites]] aka [[sulfites]].

==Key individuals==
The following people were or are instrumental in the production or communication of contemporary natural wine:

* [[Rudolf Steiner]], curator of [[biodynamics]].
* [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9146710/Maria-Thun.html Maria Thun] - was a leading authority on “biodynamics”, an approach to agriculture and horticulture which uses the waxing and waning of the moon and the position of the planets and constellations to determine when to sow and harvest; her annual Biodynamic Sowing and Planting Calendar was regarded as a vital land practice tool by aficionados.
* [[Masanobu Fukuoka]], Japanese philosopher of farming.
* [[Jules Chauvet]], developer of [[carbonic maceration]] fermentation, sulphite free winemaking, and author.
* [[Nicolas Joly]], wine producer, head of Renaissance des Appellations Controlees, and spokesman for biodynamics.
* Marcel Lapierre, wine producer, mentor, and early adopter of low to no sulphite winemaking.
* Isabelle Legeron MW, founder of RAW WINE and author of ''Natural Wine: an introduction to organic &amp; biodynamic wines made naturally'', which received positive reviews from ''[[The World of Fine Wine]]'' and ''[[Decanter Magazine]]''.
* [[James Hird]], along with [[Giorgio De Maria]] and [[Mike Bennie]], co-Founders of Rootstock Sydney Festival, a not for profit, sustainable wine and food festival in Sydney Australia.

==Controversy==
The term "Natural wine" is considered by some critics, such as [[Tom Wark]], to be a misleading term. There is no established certification body and the term has no legal status. Winemakers who describe themselves (or are described by others) as "natural" often differ in what they consider to be an acceptable level of intervention. The term might also confuse consumers into assuming that the wine is organically grown.

The inherent ambiguity of the term has been defended by Bradford Taylor, owner of [[Ordinaire (wine bar)|Ordinaire]], a [[wine bar]] in [[Oakland, California]] that exclusively serves natural wine. According to Taylor, "there's something productive about how nebulous the term 'natural' is, how it opens itself up to debate every time it comes up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''nonce word''' (also called an '''occasionalism''') is a [[lexeme]] created for a single occasion to solve an immediate problem of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/nonce-word |title=Nonce Word |work=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |date=2011 |accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Crystal&gt;''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of The English Language''. Ed. [[David Crystal]]. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1995. {{ISBN|0521401798}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|132}} 

Some nonce words may acquire a fixed meaning inferred from context and use, possibly even becoming an established part of the language, at which point they stop being nonce words, while others are essentially meaningless and disposable and are useful for exactly that reason. For instance in child language testing, {{citation required|date=November 2013}} examples of such words include "[[Jean_Berko_Gleason#Children.27s_learning_of_English_morphology.E2.80.8D.E2.80.94.E2.80.8Cthe_Wug_Test|wug]]"  and "blicket".&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society'', 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mJAclUVF8jIC&amp;pg=PA388 p. 388]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicology==
The term is used because such a word is created "[[wikt:for the nonce|for the nonce]]".&lt;ref name=Crystal/&gt;{{RP|455}} All nonce words are also [[Neologism|neologisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Malmkjaer, Kirsten. (Ed.) (2006) ''The Linguistics Encyclopedia''. eBook edition. London &amp; New York: Routledge, p. 601. {{ISBN|0-203-43286-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''nonce word'' was apparently the creation of [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], the influential editor of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.{{citation required|date=March 2014}}

==In child development studies==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
Nonce words are sometimes used to study the [[Language development|development of language]] in children because they allow researchers to test how children treat words of which they have no prior knowledge. This permits inferences about the default assumptions children make about new word meanings, syntactic structure, etc. "Wug" is among the earliest known nonce words used in language learning studies, and is best known for its use in [[Jean Berko Gleason|Jean Berko]]'s "Wug test", in which children were presented with a novel object, called a wug, and then shown multiple instances of the object and asked to complete a sentence that elicits a plural form—e.g., "This is a wug. Now there are two of them. There are two...?" The use of the plural form "wugs" by the child suggests that they have applied a plural rule to the form, and that this knowledge is not specific to prior experience with the word but applies to all nouns, whether familiar or novel.

== Other examples ==

A poem by [[Seamus Heaney]] entitled "Nonce Words" is included in his collection ''[[District and Circle]]''.

Other examples of nonce words include:

* ''Fluddle'', a word reported by [[David Crystal]] which he understood to mean a water spillage between a puddle and a flood, invented by the speaker because no suitable word existed. Crystal speculated in 1995 that it might enter the English language if it proved popular.&lt;ref name=Crystal/&gt;
* [[Bouba/kiki_effect|''Bouba'' and ''kiki'']], used to demonstrate a connection between the sound of words and their meaning.
* ''[[Grok]]'' – coined by [[Robert Heinlein]] in ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', and now almost mainstreamed.
* The poem "[[Jabberwocky]]" is full of nonce words, with only one, ''[[wikt:chortle|chortle]]'', becoming a word in common use.
* The novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' used the word ''quark'' as a nonce word. Physicist [[Murray Gell-Mann]] adopted this word as the name of a [[Quark|subatomic particle]].
* "Bückstabü", the title of a [[Rammstein]] song from their 2009 album ''[[Liebe ist fuer alle da]]'', intended to mean whatever the listener wants it to mean

{{Refimprove|date=December 2012}}
'''Play-by-mail games''', or '''play-by-post games''', are [[game]]s, of any type, played through postal [[mail]] or [[email]].

[[Correspondence chess]] has been played by mail for centuries. The boardgame ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]'' has been played by mail since the 1960s, starting with a printed newsletter (a [[fanzine]]) written by [[John Boardman (physicist)|John Boardman]]. More complex games, moderated entirely or partially by computer programs, were pioneered by [[Rick Loomis]] of [[Flying Buffalo]] in  1970.  The first such game offered via major email services was ''[[WebWar II]]'' (based on Starweb and licensed from Flying Buffalo) from Neolithic Enterprises who accepted email turns from all of the major email services including [[CompuServe]] in 1983.

Play by mail games are often referred to as PBM games, and play by email is sometimes abbreviated PBeM—as opposed to face to face (FTF) or over the board (OTB) games which are played in person. Another variation on the name is [[play-by-Internet]] (PBI) or play-by-web (PBW). In all of these examples, player instructions can be either executed by a human moderator, a computer program, or a combination of the two.

In the 1980s, play-by-mail games reached their peak of popularity with the advent of ''Gaming Universal'', ''Paper Mayhem'' and ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', the first professional magazines devoted to play-by-mail games. (An earlier fanzine, ''[[The Nuts &amp; Bolts of PBM]]'', was the first publication to exclusively cover the hobby.) Bob McLain, the publisher and editor of Gaming Universal, further popularized the hobby by writing articles that appeared in many of the leading mainstream gaming magazines of the time. Flagship later bought overseas right to Gaming Universal, making it the leading magazine in the field. ''Flagship magazine'' was founded by Chris Harvey and [[Nick Palmer]]. The magazine still exists, under a new editor, but health concerns have led to worries over the publication's long term viability.

In the late 1990s, computer and Internet games marginalized play-by-mail conducted by actual postal mail, but the postal hobby still exists with an estimated 2000–3000 adherents worldwide.

==Postal gaming==
[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]
'''Postal gaming''' developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other. It was especially useful for those living in isolated areas and those whose tastes in games were uncommon.

In the case of a two player game such as [[chess]], players would simply send their moves to each other alternately.  In the case of a multi-player game such as [[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]], a central [[game master]] would run the game, receiving the moves and publishing adjudications. Such adjudications were often published in postal game [[zine]]s, some of which contained far more than just games.

The commercial market for play-by-mail games grew to involve computer servers set up to host potentially thousands of players at once.  Players would typically be split up into parallel games in order to keep the number of players per game at a reasonable level, with new games starting as old games ended.  A typical closed game session might involve one to two dozen players, although some games claimed to have as many as five hundred people simultaneously competing in the same game world.  While the central company was responsible for feeding in moves and mailing the processed output back to players, players were also provided with the mailing addresses of others so that direct contact could be made and negotiations performed.  With turns being processed every few weeks (a two-week turnaround being standard), more advanced games could last over a year.

Game themes are heavily varied, and may range from those based on historical or real events to those taking place in alternate or fictional worlds.

One of the most successful and longest running PBM games is TribeNet, a strategy game with themes of exploration, trade and warfare.  TribeNet was launched by Jeff Perkins as a PBM in 1985 and was transformed by Peter Rzechorzek into a PBeM when he took over the game in 1997. Peter has remained in charge for over twenty years. 

The onset of the computer-moderated PBM game (primarily the ''[[Legends (PBM)|Legends]]'' game system) inevitably meant that the human moderated games became "boutique" games with little chance of matching the gross revenues that larger, automated games could produce.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Mechanics===
The mechanics of play-by-mail games require that players think and plan carefully before making moves.  Because planned actions can typically only be submitted at a fixed maximum frequency (e.g., once every few days or every few weeks), the number of discrete actions is limited compared to real-time games.  As a result, players are provided with a variety of resources to assist in turn planning, including game aids, maps, and results from previous turns.  Using this material, planning a single turn may take a number of hours.

Actual move/turn submission is traditionally carried out by filling in a ''turn card''.  This card has formatted entry areas where players enter their planned actions (using some form of encoding) for the upcoming turn.  Players are limited to some finite number of actions, and in some cases must split their resources between these actions (so that additional actions make each less effective).  The way the card is filled in often implies an ordering between each command, so that they are processed in-order, one after another.  Once completed, the card is then mailed (or, in more modern times, emailed) to the game master, where it is either processed, or held until the next turn processing window begins.

By gathering turn cards from a number of players and processing them all at the same time, games can provide simultaneous actions for all players.  However, for this same reason, co-ordination between players can be difficult to achieve.  For example, player A might attempt to move to player B's current location to do something with (or to) player B, while player B might simultaneously attempt to move to player A's current location.  As such, the output/results of the turn can differ significantly from the submitted plan.  Whatever the results, they are mailed back to the player to be studied and used as the basis for the next turn (often along with a new blank turn card).

While billing is sometimes done using a flat per-game rate (when the length of the game is known and finite), games more typically use a per-turn cost schedule.  In such cases, each turn submitted depletes a pool of credit which must periodically be replenished in order to keep playing.  Some games have multiple fee schedules, where players can pay more to perform advanced actions, or to take a greater number of actions in a turn.

Some role-playing PBM games also include an element whereby the player may describe actions of their characters in a free text form. The effect and effectiveness of the action is then based on the judgement of the GM who may allow or partially allow the action. This gives the player more flexibility beyond the normal fixed actions at the cost of more complexity and, usually, expense.

==Play-by-email==
With the rise of the [[Internet]], [[email]] and [[websites]] have largely replaced postal gaming and postal games zines. Play-by-email (PBEM) games differ from popular online multiplayer games in that, for most computerized multiplayer games, the players have to be online at the same time - also known as synchronous play. With a play-by-mail game, the players can play whenever they choose, since responses need not be immediate; this is sometimes referred to as [[turn-based gaming]] and is common among [[Browser game|browser-based]] games.  Some [[video game]]s can be played in turn-based mode: one player makes a move, declaring it by email, and then the turn passes to another player who to makes his or her move. Depending on the game, a PBEM Aide may be available as an alternative to describing the move with text. Such an aide generally consists of a picture of the board along with movable playing pieces, cards, etc. A player moves the pieces as desired and then can either save a static picture of the new game state, or a replay sequentially showing all changes that transpired during his turn, and send this to his opponent.

Several non-commercial email games played on the [[Internet]] and [[BITNET]] predate these.{{Examples|plural|date=July 2015}} Some cards games like poker can also be played by email using cryptography, such as with [[FXTOP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pele.org/cryptopoker/patent_long_distance_card_game_without_any_intermediate_english_version_WO02085475A2.pdf |title=cryptopoker.fr Secured software and process to play long distance poker without any intermediate or third party |website=Pele.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrelevant citation|date=June 2017|reason=aaa}}

==Play-by-web==
An increasingly popular format for play-by-email games is play-by-web. As with play-by-email games the players are notified by email when it becomes their turn, but they must then return to the game's website to continue playing what is essentially a [[Browser game|browser-based]] game. The main advantage of this is that the players can be presented with a graphical representation of the game and an interactive interface to guide them through their turn. Since the notifications only have to remind the players that it is their turn they can just as easily be sent via [[Instant messenger|instant messaging]].

Some sites have extended this gaming style by allowing the players to see each other's actions as they are made. This allows for real time playing while everyone is online and active, or slower progress if not.

Increasingly, this format is being adopted by social and mobile games, often described using the term "asynchronous multiplayer".

[[Swedish nobility|Baron]] '''Povel Karl Henric Ramel''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈpoːvɛl ˈramːɛl||sv-Povel Ramel.ogg}}; 1 June 1922 – 5 June 2007) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] entertainer. Ramel was a singer, pianist, [[vaudeville]] artist, author and a [[novelty song]] composer.  His style was characterized by imaginative wit, both verbal and musical.&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'' article about Ramel&lt;/ref&gt; He took inspiration from US and UK 'crazy' style humor and created his own personal Swedish version, unusual combinations of lyrics and music, word play, [[pastiche]] and general unexpectedness. He wrote approximately 1700 songs, skits and monologues, and he is regarded as a legend and an institution in Swedish entertainment.&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/musik/varfor-skulle-nan-kopa-en-zebra "Varför skulle nån köpa en zebra?"] Interview in ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' November 2, 2006, retrieved June 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Povel Ramel was born in [[Östermalm]], Stockholm into an affluent noble family. His father, Karl Ramel, was a lawyer. At a young age, Ramel found a loving audience for his talents in the family nurses, maids and cooks, and also his parents. His family often went on extensive holidays, and on such an occasion, on a beach in [[Belgium]], when Povel was two years old he stepped on a nail. With the wound infected Povel was not expected to survive, although he recovered, with a slight permanent injury.

Ramel's school-life was troubled. He cut classes, often going to [[Skansen]], an [[open-air museum]] and [[zoo]], favouring their [[monkey]] house. To avoid getting into trouble, Ramel told his teachers that he had lost his attendance book, thereby getting a new one, while showing his parents the old one, free from absence remarks. However, one day his father spotted Ramel visiting the monkey house. Subsequently, his father tried sending Ramel to various schools, but with little success.

At the age of 15, Ramel accompanied his parents on a car trip. There was a collision and Ramel's mother, Märta Tesch, died the following day in hospital. His father died a few months later.

==Career==

After his parents' death, Ramel was raised by his paternal aunt, who recognised his artistic potential. He went to art school, but his infatuation with painting did not last. However, he developed a love for playing the piano and for words, as he became inspired by musicians such as [[Bing Crosby]], [[Fats Waller]], British trumpeter [[Nat Gonella]], [[Spike Jones]] and British dance band leader [[Harry Roy]]. Entering ''[[Aftonbladet]]'''s talent hunt, [[Vi som vill opp]] in 1939, Ramel sang and ''yawned'' his own composition, "En sömnig serenad" ("A Sleepy Serenade"). By this time Ramel was already a prolific songwriter. His aunt wrote the lyrics to one of his songs, "En vår utan dig" ("A Spring Without You"), which he recorded. Ramel's lyrics are noted for their humor and dramatic wordplay. Musically he was able to adopt styles from most types of music for his own purposes.

Later, when called to do his military service, his foot condition kept him out of active duty, and he was given an administrative role. When studying the military code, he learned that most everything was forbidden. But, with no rules to be found against [[Boogie Woogie]] [[Walz]]es, he dutifully wrote ''Johanssons boogie-woogie-vals'', the song that was later to become his first hit.

[[STIM]] (a musical copyright agency) required the record have a label banning its airplay. As a result, the sales were minimal. Then a friend at the record company sent a copy with the label pulled off to Radiotjänst (The Swedish Broadcasting Corporation), and the sales jumped. Ramel was hired by Radiotjänst in 1945, which ushered in a new era of radio entertainment. With several series of innovative radio shows featuring the crazy style of humor, he became a household name in Sweden.

===Knäppupp===
In 1952 Ramel and [[Felix Alvo]] started the [[Knäppupp]] AB (Unbutton Inc.) company. The Knäppupp vaudeville shows were popular with Swedish audiences.&lt;ref name="NE" /&gt; His first vaudeville show was "Akta Huvet" ("Mind Your Head") and Ramel made his entrance hanging from a cable over the auditorium. The show opened at the ''Cirkus'' theatre in [[Gothenburg]] in 1952. Knäppupp AB also produced a number of movies, such as ''Ratataa'' in 1956. Ramel also had several pub shows such as, "Karamelodier". "Karamelodier" is one of Ramel's typical puns, as the word ''karamelodier'' is a combination of the words "karamell" (bon-bon), "Ramel" and "melodier" (melodies).

===Some of his most famous songs===
* Johanssons boogie woogie vals (Johansson's Boogie Woogie Waltz)
* Måste vägen till Curaçao gynga så (Why must the Boat to [[Curaçao]] sway like this)
:Gynga is a broken Swedish version of Gunga (Swing/Sway)
:This song was written by Povel on the [[Motorship|M/S]] San Blas, in a storm, and sung at the stage in San Blas later.
* Släkt-huset (The Family House, mocking "the old family fam" theme)
* Högt uppe på berget (High up on the Mountain)
:Swedish language version of [[On Top of Old Smoky]]
* Far, jag kan inte få upp min kokosnöt (Daddy, I Can't Break Open my [[Coconut]])
:Swedish language version of [[I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts]], featured in ''[[My Life as a Dog]]''
* Skratt (Laughs)
:Presented with some "laughing types" as the engineer's laugh "Hoho hooooooooo" (Like a [[steam whistle]]), "ping-pong laugh" Ha-ha-&lt;small&gt;ha-ha-ha-ha&lt;/small&gt;
* Nya Skrytvalsen (The New Bragging Waltz)
* Tjo va de va livat i holken i lördags (Whoopee Whatta Bustle in the Nesting Box last Saturday)
* Naturbarn (Children of Nature)
* Är det nån som har en våning åt mej? (Anyone Got an Apartment for me?)
* Sorglösa brunn (Carefree Spa, a play based on his time in "Källviks brunn" in [[Loftahammar]])
* Varför är där ingen is till [[punsch]]en? (Why no Ice with the [[Punsch]]?, mocking the "good old days" theme)
* De sista entusiasterna (The Last Enthusiasts)
* Karl Nilsson
* Det skulle aldrig delfinerna göra (That, the Dolphins Would Never do)
:A song about the fact that no dolphin would ever become a singer, as they are (as sung by Ramel) all too smart.
* Jag diggar dig (I dig you)
:Anticipating [[Hip hop music|rap]] music.
* While he almost exclusively worked in Swedish language, he has written at least one song in English, "The Sukiyaki Syndrome", about a visit to a Japanese restaurant, and others with a brief English introduction such as "Birth of the [[Gammeldans]]".

===References to current events===

Ramel was not interested in political satire or in lampooning public figures, and only a few of his songs refer to current events. There are a few exceptions:
* En tillräckligt stor summa pengar (A sum of money big enough) – 2005–2006
** In this recent song there are some references, for example: ''Gamla kapare som [[Ford]] och [[Rockefeller]], har seglats om av kapten [[Bill Gates|Gates]] (But old capers like [[Henry Ford|Ford]] and [[Rockefeller]], have been sailed past by Captain [[Bill Gates|Gates]])
* The Nej Tack Jump (The No Thanks Jump) (No to Nuclear Power)
** He sings: [[Barsebäck]], [[Forsmark]], [[Ringhals Nuclear Power Plant|Ringhals]], [[Oskarshamn]], (Swedish [[nuclear power]] stations) yes, we do like you. But the brooding striped blocks you've build, you should scrap as soon as possible.
*** Ramel has later explained that he did not state whether he was in favour of nuclear power or not. Many asked him to write this kind of song and he did, without expressing his own opinion.

==Karamelodiktstipendiet==
In 1983 Ramel founded ''Karamelodiktstipendiet'', a prize annually awarded to a Swedish entertainer or group of entertainers. It is intended for renewers of the Swedish language or related musical advances. The prize was presented by Ramel in [[Hagaparken]] in Stockholm. The name of the prize is a pun similar to the one described above, referring to "karamell" and Ramel; "dikt" means poem and "stipendie" scholarship. Thus the recipient is not only awarded a monetary prize, but also a bag of candy and a poem written by Ramel himself. After the ceremony everyone is offered fried pigeon, which most guests politely abstain from eating. The prize, according to the founder, is enough to make the recipient economically independent, at least for the rest of the day (it was 20.000 SEK until 2007 when it was increased to 25.000 SEK).

The 2007 ceremony was led by Ramel's children Mikael and Lotta, due to their father being confined to his home after heart surgery.

==Bibliography==
Povel Ramel wrote a number of books, his first in 1945, though his main focus was always on his music.
Here is a list of his books (not including the many book of lyrics that he published):

===''Från Asar till Wasar''===
* (From [[Aesir|Asar]] to [[Gustav I of Sweden|the House of Vasa]]), 1945.
In this book, Ramel presents himself as an 'eternity-human', born in the ice age.
He describes the history of Sweden "as it was" from the old Norse "Asar"-gods to [[Gustav Vasa]].
He also has some 'eternity-friends' and an 'eternity-dog' called Missräkningen (The miscalculation).

===Min galna hage===
* (My Looney Pasture), 1957.
Ramel's pasture is said to have corners. 5 of them. It is a crazy pasture.

This book has sections, called corners. These are:
* Poetiska hörnet (The poetry corner)
* *  Poems written by a fictional lady called Ewa Sophi Drömmington
* De smås hörn (The tiny ones' corner)
* *  Some stories about Little Huno and his 36 siblings, for example Lille Päron (Little Pear) whom all the siblings used to hit ''because he '''liked''' it''
* Blandade Hörnet (The mixed corner)
* *  Includes a part from Från Asar till Wasar and some other mixed writings.
* Makabra Hörnet (The macabre corner)

* * * Povel wrote here: 'Don't read this if you already doubt my mental sanity!'
* Helraspiga hörnet (Completely crazy corner)
* *  Stories ''Den trasiga middagen'' (The broken dinner), about Det Lilla Polki (The Little Polki) Far och Pappa (Father and Dad) and some other strange characters such as Onkel Zebraton från Afrika (Uncle Zebraton from Africa), Farbror Flicka (Uncle Girl) and Bästekock Lortig (Best-cook Dirty), whom after the third time slipped on a ratshell and became lying and stopping potatoes.
* * * This corner also includes a dictionary with strange definitions of words

===Knäppupplevelser===

===Lingonben===
* (Lingonberry legs), 1978.

* (Walk with me back along the road, Ramel's "life-parts" part 1), 1992.
This begins with Ramel's youth and ends when he married his wife in 1949.
He describes many things of his life, such as when he, as a child, cut big holes in his clothes, to find out what it was like to be poor!
Ramel choose to not call the book his 'memoarer' (memoirs), as that would sound too boring!
"Följ mej bakåt vägen" is also a title of one of Ramel's songs.

===Förflerade Lingonben===
* Increased Lingonberry legs), 1992
This is a longer edition of Lingonben with some well-known and less well known unknown songs.

It has been reprinted many times, most recently in 1997.

'''Quack.com''' was an early [[voice portal]] company. The [[domain name]] later was used for Quack, an iPad search application from AOL.

==History==
It was founded in 1998 by [[Steven Woods]], [[Jeromy Carriere]] and [[Alex Quilici]] as a [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States|USA]], based [[voice portal]] infrastructure company named Quackware.  Quack was the first company to try to create a voice portal: a consumer-based destination "site" in which consumers could not only access information by voice alone, but also complete transactions.  Quackware launched a beta phone service in 1999 that allowed consumers to purchase books from sites such as Amazon and CDs from sites such as CDNow by answering a short set of questions.  Quack followed with a set of information services from movie listings (inspired by, but expanding upon, [[Moviefone]]) to news, weather and stock quotes.  This concept introduced a series of lookalike startups including  [[Tellme Networks]] which raised more money than any Internet startup in history on a similar concept.{{Citation needed |date= June 2013}}

Quack received [[venture capital|venture funding]] in 1999 and moved operations to [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] in [[Silicon Valley]], [[California]] in 1999.  
A deal with [[Lycos]] was announced in May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Deals deliver validation to voice portal players |author= John Borland |date= May 23, 2000 |work= Cnet News |url= http://news.cnet.com/2100-1033-245211.html  |accessdate= June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= AOL nabs Quack.com for voice recognition |author= John Borland |date= August 31, 2000 |work= Cnet News |url= http://news.cnet.com/Deals-deliver-validation-to-voice-portal-players/2100-1033_3-240916.html |accessdate= June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2000 Quack was acquired&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= If It Walks Like a Duck, Quack.com |date= September 1, 2000 |author= Kelly Black |work= Internet News |url= http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/451061 |accessdate= June 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for $200 million by [[America Online]] (AOL) and moved onto the [[Netscape]] campus with what was left of the Netscape team.

Quack was attacked in the Canadian press for being representative of the Canadian "[[brain drain]]" to the US during the [[Internet bubble]], focusing its recruiting efforts on the [[University of Waterloo]], hiring more than 50 engineers from Waterloo in less than 10 months.  Quack competitor [[Tellme Networks]] raised enormous funds in what became a highly competitive market in 2000, with the emergence of more than a dozen additional competitors in a 12-month period.{{Citation needed |date= June 2013}}

Following its acquisition by America Online in an effort led by [[Ted Leonsis]] to bring Quack into AOL Interactive, the Quack voice service became [[AOLbyPhone]] as one of AOL's "web properties" along with [[MapQuest]], [[Moviefone]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Strategic Direction at Quack.com |publisher= Harvard Business School Online   |work= Case Study |author1=Kenneth G. Hardy |author2=Amy J. Hillman |author3=Benji Shomair |date= February 27, 2002 |url= http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cb/web/product_detail.seam?R=902A03-HCB-ENG }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quack secured several [[patent]]s that underlie the technical challenges of delivering interactive voice services.  Constructing a voice portal required integrations and innovations not only in speech recognition and speech generation, but also in databases, application specification, constraint-based reasoning and artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. "Quack"'s name derived from the company goal of providing not only voice-based services, but more broadly "Quick Ubiquitous Access to Consumer Knowledge".{{Citation needed |date= June 2013}}

The patents assigned to Quack.com include: [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://quack.com System and method for voice access to Internet-based information],  [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT7103563&amp;id=j696AAAAEBAJ System and method for advertising with an Internet Voice Portal] and recognizing the axiom that in interactive voice systems one must "know the set of possible answers to a question before asking it".  [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://quack.com System and method for determining if one web site has the same information as another web site].

Quack.com was spoofed in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in March 2002 in the episode "[[Blame It on Lisa]]" in which a "ComQuaak" sign is replaced by another equally crazy telecom company name.{{Citation needed |date= June 2013}}

==2010 onwards==
In July 2010, quack.com became the focus of a new AOL iPad application, that was a web search experience. The product delivers web results and blends in picture, video and Twitter results. It enables you to preview the web results before you go to the site, search within each result, and flip through the results pages, making full use of the iPad's touch screen features. The iPad app was free via iTunes, but support discontinued in 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">In [[Marxist]] terminology, a '''revolutionary situation''' is a political situation indicative of a possibility of a revolution. The concept was introduced by [[Vladimir Lenin]] in 1913, in his article "Маёвка революционного пролетариата"&lt;ref&gt;В.И.Ленин ПСС т.23, [http://vilenin.eu/t23/p300 p. 300]
*''Quote:'' "Большей частью для революции недостаточно того, чтобы низы не хотели жить, как прежде. Для нее требуется еще, чтобы верхи не могли хозяйничать и управлять, как прежде."&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Mayovka]] of the Revolutionary Proletariat''). In the article two conditions for a revolutionary situation were described, which were later succinctly phrased as "the bottoms don't want and the tops cannot live in the old way". In later works Lenin postulated a third condition: high political activity of the working masses, their readiness to revolutionary actions.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Great Soviet Encyclopedia]],'' article "Революционная ситуация".&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lenin describes the "revolutionary situation" as follows: 

"To the Marxist it is indisputable that a revolution is impossible without a revolutionary situation; 
furthermore, it is not every revolutionary situation that leads to revolution. What, generally speaking, are the symptoms of a revolutionary situation? We shall certainly not be mistaken if we indicate the following three major symptoms: 

(1) when it is impossible for the ruling classes to maintain their rule without any change; when there is a crisis, in one form or another, among the “upper classes”, a crisis in the policy of the ruling class, leading to a fissure through which the discontent and indignation of the oppressed classes burst forth. For a revolution to take place, it is usually insufficient for “the lower classes not to want” to live in the old way; it is also 
necessary that “the upper classes should be unable” to live in the old way; 

(2) when the suffering and want of the oppressed classes have grown more acute than usual; 

(3) when, as a consequence of the above causes, there is a considerable increase in the activity of the masses, who 
uncomplainingly allow themselves to be robbed in “peace time”, but, in turbulent times, are drawn both by all the circumstances of the crisis and by the “upper classes” themselves into independent 
historical action. 

Without these objective changes, which are independent of the will, not only of individual groups and parties but even of individual classes, a revolution, as a general rule, is impossible. The totality of all these objective changes is called a '''revolutionary situation'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/cw/volume21.htm|title=Marxist Internet Archive|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Room and board''' describes a situation where, in exchange for [[money]], [[Manual labour|labor]] or other considerations, a person is provided with a place to live as well as meals on a comprehensive basis. It commonly occurs as a fee at colleges and universities; it also occurs in hotel-style accommodation for short stays.

"Room" refers to a private bedroom provided; "board" may refer to the food being provided, or alternatively, the table on which food is served.

With a room and board arrangement, the renter has a private bedroom and shares the rest of the house with the person renting out the room. This is different from [[renting]] where the renter has private living areas, including a bedroom, bathroom and kitchen.

Two commonly encountered boards are:
* ''Half Board'', where the host provides only a [[breakfast]] and [[dinner]] meals.
* ''Full Board'', where the host provides all three daily meals.

Another option is:
* ''[[Bed and breakfast]]'', literally, a place to sleep and where breakfast is provided.

*[[Boarding house]], a lodging establishment
*[[Sideboard]], an article of furniture from which food is served in a dining room

[[File:Scots Gaelic speakers in the 2011 census.png|thumb|upright=1.13|Distribution of Gaelic speakers in 2011]]
This article is about the '''phonology of the Scottish Gaelic language'''.  There is no [[Standard language|standard variety]] of [[Scottish Gaelic]]; although statements below are about all or most dialects, the north-western dialects ([[Outer Hebrides]], [[Skye]] and the [[Northwest Highlands]]) are discussed more than others as they represent the majority of speakers.

Gaelic [[phonology]] is characterised by:
*a phoneme inventory particularly rich in [[sonorant]] coronal phonemes (commonly nine in total)
*a contrasting set of [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalised]] and non-palatalised consonants
*strong initial [[Stress (linguistics)|word-stress]] and [[vowel reduction]] in [[unstressed syllable]]s
*The presence of [[preaspiration]] of stops in certain contexts
*falling [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] in most types of sentences, including questions
*[[lenition]] and extreme [[sandhi]] phenomena

Due to the geographic concentration of Gaelic speakers along the western seaboard with its numerous islands, Gaelic dialectologists tend to ascribe each island its own [[dialect]]. On the mainland, no clear dialect boundaries have been established to date but the main areas are generally assumed to be [[Argyllshire]], [[Perthshire]], [[Moidart]]/[[Ardnamurchan]], [[Wester Ross]] and [[Sutherland]].

==History of the discipline==
Descriptions of the language have largely focused on the phonology. Welsh [[naturalist]] [[Edward Lhuyd]] published the earliest major work on Scottish Gaelic after collecting data in the [[Scottish Highlands]] between 1699 and 1700, in particular data on [[Argyll]] Gaelic and the now obsolete dialects of north-east [[Inverness-shire]].{{sfn|Campbell|1963|p=?}}

Following a significant gap, the middle to the end of the twentieth century saw a great flurry of dialect studies in particular by [[Scandinavia]]n scholars, again focussing largely on phonology:
*1938 Nils Holmer ''Studies on Argyllshire Gaelic'' published by the [[University of Uppsala]]
*1937 Carl Borgstrøm ''The Dialect of [[Barra]]'' published by the [[Norsk Tidskrift for Sprogvidenskap]]
*1940 Carl Borgstrøm ''The Dialects of the [[Outer Hebrides]]'' published by the Norsk Tidskrift for Sprogvidenskap
*1941 Carl Borgstrøm ''The Dialects of Skye and [[Ross-shire]]'' published by the [[Norwegian University Press]]
*1956 Magne Oftedal ''The Gaelic of [[Leurbost]], [[Isle of Lewis]]'' published by the Norsk Tidskrift for Sprogvidenskap
*1957 Nils Holmer ''The Gaelic of [[Kintyre]]'' published by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies
*1962 Nils Holmer ''The Gaelic of Arran'' published by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies
*1966 Gordon MacGillFhinnein ''Gàidhlig Uibhist a Deas'' ("South Uist Gaelic") published by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies
*1973 Elmar Ternes ''The Phonemic Analysis of Scottish Gaelic'' (focussing on [[Applecross]] Gaelic) published by the [[Helmut Buske Verlag]]
*1978 [[Nancy Dorian]] ''[[Sutherland|East Sutherland]] Gaelic'' published by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies
*1989 Máirtín Ó Murchú ''[[East Perthshire]] Gaelic'' published by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies

In the period between 1950 and 1963, fieldwork was carried out to document all then remaining Gaelic dialects, culminating in the publication of the five-volume ''Survey of the Gaelic Dialects of Scotland'' by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies in 1997. The survey collected data from informants as far south as [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Cowal]], [[Brig o' Turk]], east to [[Blairgowrie and Rattray|Blairgowrie]], [[Braemar]] and [[Grantown-on-Spey]], north-east to [[Dunbeath]] and [[Portskerra]] and all areas west of these areas, including [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]].

==Vowels==

The following is a chart of the monophthong vowel phonemes appearing in Scottish Gaelic:{{sfn|MacAulay|1992|p=236}}
{| class="wikitable"
|+Scottish Gaelic vowel phonemes{{sfn|Bauer|2011}}

| {{IPA|ɛ}}
|
| {{IPA|ɔ}}
|-align="center"
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| colspan="3" | {{IPA|a}}
|
|}

All vowel phonemes except for {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}} can be both long (represented with {{angbr|ː}}) and short. Note that phonologically, {{IPA|/a/}} behaves both as a front or back vowel depending on the geographical area and vowel length.

===Diphthongs===
The diphthongs of Scottish Gaelic are {{IPA|/ei, ɤi, ai, ui, iə, uə, εu, ɔu, au, ia/}}.{{sfn|MacAulay|1992|p=237}}

===Orthography===
Vowels are written as follows:

:{| class="wikitable"
|+ A table of vowels with pronunciations in the [[help:IPA|IPA]]
! Spelling
! Pronunciation
! Scottish English [SSE] equivalents
! As in
|-
| a, á || {{IPA|[a]}}, {{IPA|[a]}} || cat ||  bata, ás

|-
|}

The English equivalents given are approximate, and refer most closely to [[Scottish English|the Scottish pronunciation of Standard English]].  The vowel {{IPA|[aː]}} in English ''father'' is back {{IPA|[ɑː]}} in Southern English. The {{angbr|a}} in English ''late'' in Scottish English is the pure vowel {{IPA|[eː]}} rather than the more general [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[eɪ]}}.  The same is true for the {{angbr|o}} in English ''boat'', {{IPA|[oː]}} in Scottish English, instead of the diphthong {{IPA|[əʊ]}}.

====Digraphs and trigraphs====

The language uses many vowel combinations, which can be categorised into two types, depending on the status of one or more of the written vowels in the combinations.

'''Category 1''': vowel plus glide vowels. In this category, vowels in digraphs/trigraphs that are next to a neighbouring consonant are for all intents and purposes part of the consonant, showing the broad or slender status of the consonant.

==Consonants==
Like the closely related languages, [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]], Scottish Gaelic contains what are traditionally referred to as "broad" and "slender" consonants.  Historically, [[Primitive Irish]] consonants preceding the front vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} developed a {{IPA|[j]}}-like coarticulation similar to the palatalised consonants found in [[Russian language|Russian]]{{sfn|Thurneysen|1993|p=?}}{{sfn|Thurneysen|1980|p=?}} while the consonants preceding the non-front vowels {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} developed a [[velarization|velar coarticulation]].  While Irish distinguishes "broad" (i.e. phonetically velar or velarised consonants) and "slender" (i.e. phonetically palatal or palatalised consonants), in Scottish Gaelic velarisation is only present for {{IPA|/n̪ˠ l̪ˠ rˠ/}}. This means that consonants marked "broad" by the orthography are, for the most part simply unmarked, while "slender" consonants are palatal or palatalised. The main exception to this are the labials ({{IPA|/p pʰ m f v/}}), which have lost their palatalised forms. The only trace of their original palatalisation is a glide found before or after [[back vowel]]s, e.g. ''beul'' {{IPA|/pial̪ˠ/}} ('mouth') vs ''beò'' {{IPA|/p'''j'''ɔː/}} ('alive').
Celtic linguists traditionally transcribe slender consonants with an [[apostrophe]] (or more accurately, a [[prime (symbol)|prime]]) following the consonant (e.g. m′) and leave broad consonants unmarked.

The unaspirated stops in some dialects (east and south) are voiced (see below), as in Manx and Irish, while in all other areas full voicing is allophonic with regional variation, voicing occurs in certain environments, such as within breath groups and following homorganic nasals (see below). The variation suggests that the unaspirated stops at the underlying phonological level are voiced, with devoicing an allophonic variant that in some dialects has become the most common realisation. Irish dialects and Manx also have devoiced unaspirated consonants in certain environments.

In the modern languages, there is sometimes a stronger contrast from Old Gaelic in the assumed meaning of "broad" and "slender". In the modern languages, the phonetic difference between "broad" and "slender" consonants can be more complex than mere "velarisation"/"palatalisation". For instance, the Gaelic "slender s" is so palatalised that it has become [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] {{IPA|[ʃ]}}.

Certain consonants (in particular the [[fricative]]s {{IPA|[h x ç ɣ ʝ v]}} and the lenis coronals {{IPA|[l n ɾ ɾʲ]}}) are rare in initial position except as a result of lenition.

===Phonetic variation===
[[File:Dialect map initial slender d in Scottish Gaelic.svg|thumb|Affrication of initial slender d]]
Gaelic phonemes may have various allophones as well as dialectal or variations in pronunciation not shown in the chart above. The more common ones are:
*{{IPA|/tʲʰ/}} as {{IPA|[tʃʰ]}} or {{IPA|[tɕʰ]}}{{sfn|Ó Dochartaigh|1997}}
*{{IPA|/tʲ/}} may also be affricated:{{sfn|Ó Dochartaigh|1997|loc=vol. 3}}
**'''Area 1''' without affrication {{IPA|[tʲ]}}
**'''Area 2''' with strong affrication {{IPA|[tʒ]}}
**'''Area 3''' with weak affrication {{IPA|[t&lt;sup&gt;ʒ&lt;/sup&gt;]}}
*{{IPA|/ɾʲ/}} as {{IPA|[ð]}} in Hebridean dialects{{sfn|Ó Dochartaigh|1997}}
*{{IPA|/ɲ/}} as {{IPA|[nʲ]}}{{sfn|Ó Dochartaigh|1997}}

===Velarised l===
[[File:Darklgd.jpg|thumb|upright=1.13|Allophone regions of Dark l]]
Velarised {{IPA|/l̪ˠ/}} has 6 main realisations as shown on the map:{{sfn|Ó Dochartaigh|1997}}
*'''Area 1''', by far the most populous, has {{IPA|[l̪ˠ]}}. The area includes most of the Outer Hebrides, the Highlands and areas south of central western areas such as Kintyre, Arran, Argyll and East Perthshire.
*'''Area 2''', [[Ardnamurchan]], [[Moidart]], [[Lochaber]], [[Lorne, Scotland|South Lorn]] and [[Badenoch|Upper Badenoch]] has {{IPA|[l̪ˠw]}} or {{IPA|[wl̪ˠ]}}
*'''Area 3''', between [[Mull]] and [[Lismore, Scotland|Lismore]] has [[l-vocalization|vocalised]] it: {{IPA|[u̯ˠ]}}
*'''Area 4''', in the south of Mull and [[Easdale]], has {{IPA|[ð]}} or {{IPA|[ðˠ]}}
*'''Area 5''', [[Islay]], has {{IPA|[t̪ˠ]}} or {{IPA|[t̪ˠl̪ˠ]}}
*'''Area 6''', [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]], had {{IPA|[w]}} or {{IPA|[ʊ̯]}}

The Survey of Scottish Gaelic Dialects occasionally reports labialised forms such as {{IPA|[l̪ˠw]}} or {{IPA|[l̪ˠv]}} outside the area they predominantly appear in, for example in [[Isle of Harris|Harris]] and [[Wester Ross]].

===Aspiration===
The [[fortis and lenis|fortis]] stops {{IPA|/pʰ, t̪ʰ, tʲʰ, kʲʰ, kʰ/}} are voiceless and aspirated; this aspiration occurs as postaspiration in initial position and, in most dialects, as [[#Preaspiration|preaspiration]] in medial position after stressed vowels.{{sfn|Silverman|2003|pp=578–579}} Similar to the manifestation of aspiration, the slender consonants have a palatal offglide when initial and a palatal onglide when medial or final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Silverman|2003|p=579}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Borgstrøm|1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preaspiration====
[[File:Gaelic preaspiration.jpg|thumb|The approximate distribution of preaspiration in Gaelic dialects]]
[[Preaspiration]] varies in strength and can manifest as glottal ({{IPA|[ʰ]}} or {{IPA|[h]}}) or can vary depending on the [[place of articulation]] of the preaspirated consonant; being {{IPA|[ç]}} before "slender" segments and {{IPA|[x]}} before "broad" ones.{{sfn|Silverman|2003|p=579}} The occurrence of preaspiration follows a hierarchy of c &gt; t &gt; p; i.e. if a dialect has preaspiration with {{IPA|/pʰ/}}, it will also have it in the other places of articulation. Preaspiration manifests itself as follows:{{sfn|Ó Dochartaigh|1997}}
*'''Area 1''' as {{IPA|[xk xt xp]}} and {{IPA|[çkʲ çtʲ çp]}}
*'''Area 2''' as {{IPA|[xk xt hp]}} and {{IPA|[çkʲ çtʲ hp]}}
*'''Area 3''' as {{IPA|[xk ht hp]}} and {{IPA|[çkʲ htʲ hp]}}
*'''Area 4''' as {{IPA|[ʰk ʰt ʰp]}}
*'''Area 5''' as {{IPA|[xk]}} and {{IPA|[çkʲ]}} (no preaspiration of ''t'' and ''p'')
*'''Area 6''' no preaspiration

Lack of preaspiration coincides with full voicing of the unaspirated stops. Area 6 dialects in effect largely retain the Middle Irish stops, as has Manx and Irish.

===Nasalisation===
In some Gaelic dialects (particularly the north-west), stops at the beginning of a stressed [[syllable]] become voiced when they follow [[nasal stop|nasal consonants]] of the definite article, for example: ''taigh'' ('a house') is {{IPA|[t̪ʰɤj]}} but ''an taigh'' ('the house') is {{IPA|[ən̪ˠ '''d̪&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;/sup&gt;ʱ&lt;sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;'''ɤj]}}; cf. also ''tombaca'' ('tobacco') {{IPA|[t̪ʰomˈ'''b'''aʰkə]}}.  In such dialects, the lenis stops {{IPA|/p, t, tʲ, kʲ, k/}} tend to be completely nasalised, thus ''doras'' ('a door') is {{IPA|[t̪ɔrəs]}}, but ''an doras'' ('the door') is {{IPA|[ə n̪ˠɔrəs]}}.{{sfn|Bauer|2011|p=311}} This is similar to eclipsis in Classical Gaelic and [[Irish language|Irish]], but not identical as it only occurs when a nasal is phonetically present whereas eclipsis in Classical Gaelic and Irish may occur in positions following a historic (but no longer present) nasal.{{sfn|Bauer|2011|p=312}}

The voicing of voiceless aspirated stops and the nasalisation of the unaspirated (voiced) stops occurs after the preposition '''an/am''' ('in'), '''an/am''' ('their'), the interrogative particle '''an''' and a few other such particles and occasionally, after any word ending in a nasal e.g. ''a bheil thu a' faighinn cus?'' as {{IPA|[ɡʱus]}} rather than {{IPA|[kʰus]}}.

In southern Hebridean dialects, the nasal optionally drops out entirely before a consonant, including plosives.{{sfn|MacGillFhinnein|1966|p=24}}

===Lenition and spelling===
The [[lenition|lenited]] consonants have special pronunciations.

:{{note|lent|†|[[Lenition]] of initial '''l n r''' is not shown in writing. Word initially, these are always assumed to have the strong values ({{IPA|/(l̪ˠ) ʎ n̪ˠ ɲ rˠ/}}) unless they are in a leniting environment or unless they belong to a small and clearly defined group of particle (mostly the forms of the prepositions ''ri'' and ''le''). Elsewhere, any of the realisations of ''l n r'' may occur; [l̪ˠ] is lenitable only in Harris Gaelic which retains the fourth l-sound [l̪].}}

The {{IPA|/s̪/}} is not lenited when it appears before {{IPA|/m p t̪ k/}}. [[Lenition#Blocked lenition|Lenition may be blocked]] when [[homorganic consonants]] (i.e. those made at the same [[place of articulation]]) clash with grammatical lenition rules. Some of these rules are active (particularly with dentals), others have become fossilised (i.e. velars and labials). For example, blocked lenition in the surname ''Cai'''mb'''eul'' ('Campbell') (vs ''Ca'''msh'''ron'' 'Cameron') is an incident of fossilised blocked lenition; blocked lenition in ''air a'''n t'''aigh '''s'''alach'' "on the dirty house" (vs ''air a' '''bh'''alach '''mh'''ath'' 'on the good boy') is an example of the productive lenition blocking rule.

==Stress==
Stress is usually on the first syllable: for example ''drochaid'' ('a bridge') {{IPA|[ˈt̪rɔxɪtʲ]}}.

==Epenthesis==
[[File:Scottish Gaelic dialect map vowel quality in "dearbh".svg|thumb|Vowel quality of "dearbh"]]
A distinctive characteristic of Gaelic pronunciation (also present in Scots and Scottish English dialects (cf. ''girl'' {{IPA|[ɡɪɾəl]}} and ''film'' {{IPA|[fɪləm]}}) is the insertion of [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowels between certain adjacent consonants. This affects orthographic l n r when followed by orthographic b bh ch g gh m mh; and orthographic m followed by l r s ch.
:''tarbh'' ('bull') — {{IPA|[t̪ʰaɾav]}}
:''Alba'' ('Scotland') — {{IPA|[al̪ˠapə]}}.

Occasionally, there are irregular occurrences of the epenthetic vowel, for example in ''Glaschu'' {{IPA|/kl̪ˠas̪əxu/}} ('[[Glasgow]]').

There are often wide variations in vowel quality in epenthetic vowels, as illustrated by a map showing the pronunciations of "dearbh."{{sfn|Ó Dochartaigh|1997|loc=vol. 3}}
*'''Area 1''' {{IPA|[tʲɛɾav]}}
*'''Area 2''' {{IPA|[tʲaɾa(v)]}} with the {{IPA|[v]}} appearing in the northwestern region but not the southeastern
*'''Area 3''' {{IPA|[tʲɛɾɛv]}}
*'''Area 4''' {{IPA|[tʲɛɾʊ]}} with vocalization of the {{IPA|[v]}}
*'''Area 5''' {{IPA|[tʲɛɾəv]}} with reduction of the epenthetic vowel as in Irish

==Elision==
[[Schwa]] {{IPA|[ə]}} at the end of a word is [[elision|dropped]] when followed by a word beginning with a vowel. For example:
:''duine'' ('a man') — {{IPA|[ˈt̪ɯɲə]}}
:''an duine agad'' ('your man') — {{IPA|[ən̪ˠ ˈt̪ɯɲ akət̪]}}

==Tones==
Of all the Celtic languages, lexical [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] only exist in the dialects of Lewis{{sfn|Ternes|1980|p=?}} and Sutherland{{sfn|Dorian|1978|pp=60–1}} in the extreme north of the Gaelic-speaking area. Phonetically and historically, these resemble the tones of Norway, Sweden and western Denmark; these languages have tonal contours typical for monosyllabic words and those for disyllabic words.  In Lewis Gaelic, it is difficult to find minimal pairs. Among the rare examples are: ''bodh(a)'' {{IPA|[po.ə]}} ('underwater rock') vs. ''bò'' {{IPA|[poː]}} ('cow'), and ''fitheach'' {{IPA|[fi.əx]}} ('raven') vs. ''fiach'' {{IPA|[fiəx]}} ('debt'). Another example is the tonal difference between ''ainm'' {{IPA|[ɛnɛm]}} and ''anam'' {{IPA|[anam]}}, the latter of which has the tonal contour appropriate to a disyllable. These tonal differences are not to be found in Ireland or elsewhere in the Scottish ''[[Gàidhealtachd]]''.{{sfn|Clement|1994|p=108}} Furthermore, they are disappearing entirely among younger speakers even in Lewis.{{sfn|Nance|2015|p=569}}

==Morphophonology==
[[File:Phonetic realization of regular verbal noun particle, written (e)adh.svg|thumb|Phonetic realization of regular verbal noun particle]]
===Morphophonological variation===
The regular verbal noun particle, written &lt;(e)adh&gt;, has several pronunciations.
*'''Area 1''': {{IPA|[əɣ]}} (as expected from the spelling)
*'''Area 2''': {{IPA|[ək]}}
*'''Area 3''': {{IPA|[əv]}}
*'''Area 4''': no suffix
*'''Area 5''': {{IPA|[ʊ]}}
*'''Area 6''' is characterized by a high level of variation both between words and adjacent informants
[[File:Scottish Gaelic regular VN suffix in "sgrìobadh".svg|thumb|left|The verbal noun suffix in sgrìobadh]]
For some words it is possible to resolve the indeterminate area, for example with the verb sgrìobadh ("scraping"):
*'''Area 1''': {{IPA|[əɣ]}} (as expected from the spelling)
*'''Area 2''': {{IPA|[ək]}}
*'''Area 3''': {{IPA|[əv]}}
*'''Area 4''': no suffix
*'''Area 5''': {{IPA|[ʊ]}}
*'''Area 6''': {{IPA|[ə]}}

'''Southern Qiang''' is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] of the [[Qiangic languages|Qiangic branch]] spoken by approximately 81,300 people along the [[Minjiang River (Sichuan)|Minjiang]] (岷江) river in [[Sichuan Province]], [[China]].

Unlike its close relative [[Northern Qiang language|Northern Qiang]], Southern Qiang is a [[tonal language]].

==Southern Qiang dialects==
Southern Qiang is spoken in [[Li County, Sichuan|Li County]] (in Taoping 桃坪, etc.), [[Wenchuan County]] (in [[Longxi Township, Wenchuan County|Longxi]] 龙溪, [[Luobozhai, located in Wenchuan County of Sichuan province of China.|Luobozhai]] 萝卜寨, Miansi 绵虒, etc.), and parts of [[Mao County]]. It consists of seven dialects: Dajishan, Taoping, Longxi, Mianchi, Heihu, Sanlong, and Jiaochang, which are greatly divergent and are not mutually intelligible.

Names seen in the older literature for Southern Qiang dialects include ''Lofuchai (Lophuchai, Lopu Chai),'' ''Wagsod (Wa-gsod, Waszu),''&lt;ref&gt;John McCoy &amp; Timothy Light, ed., 1986, ''Contributions to Sino-Tibetan Studies,'' pp. 40, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Outside/Outer Mantse (Man-tzŭ)''.&lt;ref&gt;UC Berkeley, 1992, ''Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area'', vol. 15, pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liu (1998) adds Sanlong (三龍) and Jiaochang (較場) to the Southern subdialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mawo Qiangyu Yanjiu|last = Liu|first = Guangkun|publisher = Sichuan Nationality Press|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowel chart and discussion of vowels.

===Consonants===
Consonant chart and discussion of consonants.

===Phonology===
Discussion of some major phonological processes, such as important [[allophone]]s or assimilation rules.

===Historical sound changes===
Description of important sound changes in the history of the language. (Maybe this should go under history?)

==Status==
As with many of the [[Qiangic languages]], Southern Qiang is becoming increasingly threatened. Because the education system largely uses [[Standard Chinese]] as a medium of instruction for the Qiang people, and as a result of the universal access to schooling and TV, most Wiang children are fluent or even monolingual in Chinese while an increasing percentage cannot speak Qiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5Nvuh7MQlYC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A Grammar of Qiang: With annotated texts and glossary |author= Randy J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1684">[[William Thurston]]'s '''elliptization conjecture''' states that a closed [[manifold|3-manifold]] with finite [[fundamental group]] is [[spherical 3-manifold|spherical]], i.e. has a [[Riemannian metric]] of constant positive sectional curvature.  A 3-manifold with such a metric is covered by the 3-sphere, moreover the group of covering transformations are isometries of the 3-sphere.  Note that this means that if the original 3-manifold had in fact a trivial fundamental group, then it is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[3-sphere]] (via the [[covering map]]).  Thus, proving the elliptization conjecture would prove the [[Poincaré conjecture]] as a corollary. In fact, the elliptization conjecture is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to two simpler conjectures: the [[Poincaré conjecture]] and the [[spherical space form conjecture]].

The elliptization conjecture is a special case of Thurston's [[geometrization conjecture]], which was proved in 2003 by [[G. Perelman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19226">'''Virtual water trade''' (also known as trade in '''embedded''' or '''embodied water''') refers to the hidden flow of water if food or other [[commodities]] are [[trade]]d from one place to another.  For instance, it takes 1,340 cubic meters of water (based on the world average) to [[crop production|produce]] one metric tonne of [[wheat]]. The precise volume can be more or less depending on climatic conditions and [[agricultural]] practice. Hoekstra and Chapagain have defined the virtual-water content of a product (a commodity, good or service) as "the volume of [[freshwater]] used to produce the product, measured at the place where the product was actually produced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11269-006-9039-x |vauthors=Hoekstra AY, Chapagain AK |title=Water footprints of nations: water use by people as a function of their consumption pattern |journal=Water Resources Management |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=35–48 |year=2007 |url=http://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the sum of the water use in the various steps of the production chain.

[[King's College London]] and the [[SOAS, University of London]] introduced the virtual water concept,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19926700.100-looming-water-crisis-simply-a-management-problem.html "Looming water crisis simply a management problem"] by [[Jonathan Chenoweth]], [[New Scientist]] 28 Aug., 2008, pp. 28-32.
&lt;/ref&gt; to support his argument that countries in the [[Middle East]] can save their scarce water resources by relying more on import of food. For his contributions he was awarded the 2008 [[Stockholm Water Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siwi.org/sa/node.asp?node=25 Publications | Stockholm International Water Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Allan stated: "The water is said to be virtual because once the wheat is grown, the real water used to grow it is no longer actually contained in the wheat. The concept of virtual water helps us realize how much water is needed to produce different goods and services.  In semi-arid and arid areas, knowing the virtual water value of a good or service can be useful towards determining how best to use the scarce water available."

There are, however, significant deficiencies with the concept of virtual water that mean there is a significant risk in relying on these measures to guide policy conclusions. Accordingly, Australia's National Water Commission considers that the measurement of virtual water has little practical value in decision making regarding the best allocation of scarce water resources.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/wayback/20160615091008/http://archive.nwc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/11885/DistilledJuly2008.pdf {{ISSN|1833-1491}}&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade==

'''Virtual water trade''' refers to the idea that when goods and services are exchanged, so is virtual water.  When a country imports one tonne of wheat instead of producing it domestically, it is saving about 1,300 cubic meters of real indigenous water.  If this country is [[water scarcity|water-scarce]], the water that is 'saved' can be used towards other ends.  If the exporting country is water-scarce, however, it has exported 1,300 cubic meters of virtual water since the real water used to grow the wheat will no longer be available for other purposes. This has obvious strategic implications for countries that are water-constrained such as those found in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) area.&lt;ref&gt;Turton, A.R. 1998. The Hydropolitics of Southern Africa: The Case of the Zambezi River Basin as an Area of Potential Co-operation Based on Allan's Concept of ‘Virtual Water’. Unpublished M.A. Dissertation, Department of International Politics, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turton, A.R., Moodley, S., Goldblatt, M. &amp; Meissner, R. 2000. An Analysis of the Role of Virtual Water in Southern Africa in Meeting Water Scarcity: An Applied Research and Capacity Building Project. Johannesburg: Group for Environmental Monitoring (GEM).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earle, A. &amp; Turton, A.R. 2003. The Virtual Water Trade amongst Countries of the SADC. In Hoekstra, A. (Ed.) Virtual Water Trade: Proceedings of the International Experts Meeting on Virtual Water Trade. Delft, the Netherlands, 12–13 December 2002. Research Report Series No. 12. Delft: IHE. Pp. 183-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water-scarce countries like [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] discourage the export of oranges (relatively water intensive crops) precisely to prevent large quantities of water being exported to different parts of the world.

In recent years, the concept of virtual water trade has gained weight both in the scientific as well as in the political debate. The notion of the concept is ambiguous. It changes between an analytical, descriptive concept and a political induced strategy.  As an analytical concept, virtual water trade represents an instrument which allows the identification and assessment of policy options not only in the scientific but also in the political discourse.  As a politically induced strategy the question is, whether virtual water trade can be implemented in a [[sustainable]] way, whether the implementation can be managed in a social, economical and ecological fashion, and for which countries the concept offers a meaningful option.

The data that underlie the concept of virtual water can readily be used to construct water satellite accounts, and brought into economic models of international trade such as the [[GTAP]] Computable General Equilibrium Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berrittella M, Hoekstra AY, Rehdanz K, Roson R, Tol RS |title=The Economic Impact of Restricted Water Supply: A Computable General Equilibrium Analysis |journal=Water Research |volume= 41|pages=1799–813 |year=2007 |url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/sgc/wpaper/93.html |pmid=17343892 |issue=8 |doi=10.1016/j.watres.2007.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a model can be used to study the economic implications of changes in water supply or water policy, as well as the water resource implications of economic development and trade liberalisation.

In sum, virtual water trade allows a new, amplified perspective on water problems: In the framework of recent developments from a supply-oriented to a demand-oriented management of water resources it opens up new fields of [[governance]] and facilitates a differentiation and balancing of different perspectives, basic conditions and interests.  Analytically, the concept enables one to distinguish between global, regional and local levels and their linkages. This means, that water resource problems have to be solved in ''problemsheds''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Allan T |title=Watersheds and problemsheds: Explaining the absence of Armed Conflict over water in the Middle East |journal=Middle East Review of International Affairs |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages= |year=1998 |url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/1998/issue1/jv2n1a7.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127104256/http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/1998/issue1/jv2n1a7.html |archivedate=November 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earle, A. 2003. Watersheds and Problemsheds: A Strategic Perspective on the Water/Food/Trade Nexus in Southern Africa. In Turton, A.R., Ashton, P.J. &amp; Cloete, T.E. (Eds.) Transboundary Rivers, Sovereignty and Development: Hydropolitical Drivers in the Okavango River Basin. Pretoria &amp; Geneva: AWIRU &amp; Green Cross International. Pp. 229-249.&lt;/ref&gt; if they cannot be successfully addressed in the local or regional watershed. Virtual water trade can thus overcome the hydro-centricity of a narrow watershed view. According to the proceedings of a 2006 conference in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, it seems reasonable to link the new concept with the approach of [[integrated water resources management]].

==Limitations of the virtual water measure==

Key shortcomings of virtual water measures are that the concept:

# It relies on an assumption that all [[water source|sources of water]], whether in the form of [[rainfall]] or provided through an [[irrigation]] system, are of equal value.&lt;ref name=dpi&gt;[http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/42650/Virtual-Water-The-Concept-of-Virtual-Water.pdf Virtual Water - The concept of Virtual Water&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
# It implicitly assumes that water that would be released by reducing a high water use activity would necessarily be available for use in a less water-intensive activity. For example, the implicit assumption is that water used in rangeland beef production would be available to be used to produce an alternative, less water-intensive activity. As a practical matter this may not be the case, nor might the alternatives be economic.&lt;ref name=dpi/&gt;
# It fails as an indicator of [[environmental harm]] nor does it provide any indication of whether [[water resource]]s are being used within sustainable extraction limits. The use of virtual water estimates therefore offer no guidance for policy makers seeking to ensure that environmental objectives are being met.&lt;ref name=dpi/&gt;

The deficiencies with the concept of virtual water mean that there is a significant risk in relying on these measures to guide policy conclusions. Accordingly, Australia's National Water Commission considers that the measurement of virtual water has little practical value in decision making regarding the best allocation of scarce water resources.&lt;ref name=nwc&gt;[http://www.nwc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/11885/DistilledJuly2008.pdf Distilled: eNewsletter of Australia's National Water Commission, Edition 30 — July 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other limitations more specific to the MENA (Middle East &amp; [[North Africa]]) region include:
# In MENA rural societies, farmers are by tradition politically influential and would prohibit new policies for water allocation. Reallocating the water resources adds a huge burden on the farmers especially when a large portion of those farmers use their land for their own food consumption which happens to be their only source of [[food supply]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.die-gdi.de/DIE_Homepage.nsf/6f3fa777ba64bd9ec12569cb00547f1b/01b3da26dc5fe93bc1256f81003065d4/$FILE/2005-12-07-Virtueller-Wasserhandel-Vortrag-Abbadi.pdf Slide 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718230922/http://www.die-gdi.de/DIE_Homepage.nsf/6f3fa777ba64bd9ec12569cb00547f1b/01b3da26dc5fe93bc1256f81003065d4/$FILE/2005-12-07-Virtueller-Wasserhandel-Vortrag-Abbadi.pdf |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Importing food could pose the risk of further political dependence. The notion of "[[self sufficiency]]" has always been the pride of the MENA region.&lt;ref name=osd&gt;[http://www.osd.com.jo/vertual_water.pdf Expert Statement on Virtual Water] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722070725/http://www.osd.com.jo/vertual_water.pdf |date=July 22, 2011 }} by Dr. Hazim El-Naser and Mohammad Abbadi (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
# The use of virtual water lies in the religious regulations for charging for water. According to Al-Bukhari, Prophet Mohammad's teachings, the Prophet said: "People are partners in three: Water, Herbs and Fire" (referring to basic energy resources). Therefore, and because farmers are generally poor and rain water, rivers and lakes are like a gift from God, the MENA countries might find it difficult to charge the farmers the full cost for water.&lt;ref name=osd/&gt;

==Water footprint==
The concept of virtual water trade was introduced to refer to the idea that countries can save domestic water by importing food. Imported food, however, comes from somewhere. In 2002, professor Arjen Y. Hoekstra, at the time working for UNESCO-IHE, now at University of Twente, the Netherlands, introduced the concept of [[water footprint]]. The water footprint shows the link between consumer goods or a consumption pattern and water use and pollution. Virtual water trade and water footprint can be seen as part of a bigger story: the globalization of water.

==Embodied energy==
Some researchers have attempted to use the methods of [[energy analysis]], which aim to produce [[embodied energy]] estimates, to derive virtual, or embodied water estimates.&lt;ref name=lenzen&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lenzen M, Foran B |title=An Input-Output analysis of Australian water usage |journal=Water Policy |volume=3 |issue= 4|pages=321–40 |year=2001 |doi=10.1016/S1366-7017(01)00072-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2253">'''WINMOR''' is a [[radio]] transmission protocol intended to be used in the [[Winlink]] 2000 Global Radio E-mail System by [[amateur radio]] operators, marine radio stations, and radio stations in isolated areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/new-hf-digital-protocol-to-debut-at-dcc ARRL: New HF Digital Protocol to Debut at DCC], 26&amp;nbsp;August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  WINMOR will complement the [[PACTOR]] modes in the [[high frequency]] portion of the [[Winlink]] system. WINMOR debuted at the 2008 [[ARRL]] / [[Tucson Amateur Packet Radio|TAPR]] Digital Communications Conference. Unlike PACTOR II &amp; III, only a simple computer soundcard-to-radio interface is required, as compared to PACTOR's relatively expensive external [[terminal node controller]]. It has two modes, either 500 or 1600&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz]] in [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], and provides ARQ speeds ranging from 67 to at least 1300&amp;nbsp;bits per second, similar to PACTOR's various modes. It is fully documented and without restrictions or license issues preventing anyone from using the protocol in other software. WINMOR supports both connected ([[Automatic repeat request|ARQ]]) and [[Forward error correction|FEC]] (broadcast) modes.

Operational peer-to-peer (on-air) beta testing of WINMOR began on 17&amp;nbsp;September 2009. Deployment of RMS WINMOR servers for the Winlink system began in January&amp;nbsp;2010.

==Transmission modes==
500&amp;nbsp;[[Hz]] [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] uses 2&amp;nbsp;[[Carrier signal|carriers]], 1600&amp;nbsp;Hz [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] uses 8&amp;nbsp;[[Carrier signal|carriers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/files/file/WINMOR.pdf|title=Beta release of protocol specification}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each carrier uses 46.875&amp;nbsp;Baud [[Frequency-shift keying|4FSK]] or 93.75&amp;nbsp;Baud [[Phase-shift keying|PSK]] using [[Trellis modulation|Trellis Coded Modulation]] with 4, 8, or 16&amp;nbsp;phases.
