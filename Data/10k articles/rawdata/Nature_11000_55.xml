[[Image:WilliamWhistonComet.jpg|thumb|250px|A portrait of Whiston with a diagram demonstrating his theories of cometary catastrophism described in ''A New Theory of the Earth'']]

'''''A New Theory of the Earth''''' was a book written by [[William Whiston]], in which he presented a description of the divine [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] of the Earth and a posited [[deluge (mythology)|global flood]].  He also postulated that the earth originated from the atmosphere of a comet and that [[catastrophism|all major changes in earth's history]] could be attributed to the action of comets.  It was published in 1696 and was well received by intellectuals of the day such as [[Isaac Newton]] and [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;Ignatius Donnelly [http://web.stanford.edu/~meehan/donnelly/whiston.html "Whiston's Flood"] 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of the book==
The book is organized as follows:

* Introduction, discussing the text of [[Creation according to Genesis]]
* Book I: ''Lematta'', discussing the premises and assumptions on which his argument is based;
* Book II: ''Hypotheses'', discussing his model for the origin of the Earth;
* Book III: ''Phaenomena'', discussing evidence predicted by his model;
* Book IV: ''Solutions'', discussing how his model explains the evidence;
* Appendix: An abstract of his theory drawn from various sources.

===Intro===
In the introduction, Whiston discusses the Mosaic account of creation.  He argues for a literal interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], writing:
:"We must never forsake the plain, obvious, easy and natural sense, unless where the nature of the thing itself, parallel places, or evident reason, afford a solid and sufficient reason for so doing."

In so doing, he challenges allegorical and mythological interpretations of Genesis, concluding that:
:"The Mosaic Creation is not a nice and philosophical account of the origin of all things; but a historical and true representation of the formation of our single Earth out of a confused [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], and of the successive and visible changes thereof each Day, till it became the habitation of mankind." (p.3)

He interprets the Genesis account of creation as being only of the preparation of the Earth for mankind, and not as an account of creation from nothing (''[[ex nihilo]]'').  He draws this from the text, as the account speaks of the waters that existed before God's first creative act on the first day, implying that the [[Earth]] predates Genesis chapter one.

He interprets the account of "placing the heavenly bodies in the firmament" as simply being a consequence of the terrestrial [[frame of reference]], for the heavenly bodies do in fact [[Modern geocentrism|revolve about the Earth]] from the perspective of a man standing on the Earth.  

He describes his [[Arianism]], or the view that [[Jesus]] is subordinate to [[God]] but first in creation, a view considered heretical within much of [[Christianity]].  He also asserts that it is very reasonable to believe that man may well be simply one of many intelligent beings, and certainly not the highest before God.  He wrote that humanity was [[Fall (religion)|fallen]], and currently in a miserable state akin to [[probation]].

He concludes the introduction with his three ''Postulata'':
# "The obvious or literal sense of scripture is the true and redal one, where no evidence reason can be given to the contrary.
# That which is clearly accountable in a natural way, is not, without reason to be ascribed to a miraculous power.
# What ancient tradition asserts of the constitution of nature, or of the origin and primitive states of the world, is to be allowed for true, where ‘tis fully agreeable to scripture, reason, and philosophy."

===Book I: Lemmata===
Whiston begins by arguing for the existence of a human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].  He argues that the [[Newton's laws of motion|Newtonian laws]] of motion provide that matter may never move spontaneously, but only when acted upon by an outside force.  He notes that humans, animals, and plants are able to move spontaneously, and concludes that they must be more than "mere matter," which, especially in the case of humans, he argues to be evidence of an incorporeal soul.

===Books II, III, and IV: Phenomena===
In the next sections of his book, Whiston goes on to describe his theory of the creation of the Earth, and the flood.  He asserted that the Earth was originally a comet, which God formed from its initial "chaos and void" into a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet]].  He also argued that the flood itself was caused when the Earth passed through the tail of a comet, which, it was known by that time, are composed largely of water.  His analysis was very detailed, and similar ideas were promoted in the 1960s by other [[creationists]] postulating causes for the [[Flood geology|global flood]], along with similarity to the ideas of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]].  However, many of them are in direct conflict with contemporary scientific understandings; and comets are not mentioned in flood accounts.

'''''A Sacred Duty,''''' subtitled ''Applying Jewish values to help heal the world,'' is a 2007 60-minute documentary from [[Jewish Vegetarians of North America]] (JVNA), written and produced by [[Lionel Friedberg]]. The film focuses on Jewish teachings about caring for the earth, treatment of animals, and the environment, with a focus on [[vegetarianism]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.jpost.com/ArtsAndCulture/Entertainment/Article.aspx?id=82344 Jacobs, Megan, "Jews ban beef to save the world? New film insists meat-free diet is a religious imperative for every Jew," ''Jerusalem Post,'' ]&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews with rabbis, activists, and scholars are interspersed with footage and stills illustrating the points being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/film-aims-to-show-how-jewish-values-can-help-save-the-world-1.233411 Zilber, Ariel, "Film aims to show how Jewish values can help heal the World," ''Haaretz,'' November 17, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film opens with footage of a [[NASA]] rocket launch, an animation of our [[solar system]], and a quote from Deuteronomy 30:19 about choosing between life and death (illustrated with images of the planet Earth as seen from space, contrasted with an exploding [[atom bomb]]). This is followed by a statement that humanity has not been caring for the Earth properly according to Jewish teachings. Next comes a section about ancient Jewish texts and "sacred words" that provide "specific instructions on how to be custodians of the world in which we live."  Throughout the film, quotes from the [[Torah]], illustrated with closeups of Hebrew scrolls, Jews praying, and nature scenes, will be contrasted with the various environmental threats facing humanity today.

The scene shifts once again to the Earth from space, as the camera moves in to focus on [[Israel]]. The narrator then uses that country as a microcosm of current global problems related to air and water pollution, over-population, [[climate change]], health concerns, etc. The film moves on to look at problems globally, with scenes shot all over the world. The focus then shifts to the United States where all the relevant issues are discussed in detail.

Reference is made to the United Nations [[FAO]] 2006 report, [[Livestock's Long Shadow]], which makes the claim that livestock agriculture produces more [[greenhouse gas]]ses than all the world's vehicles combined. Next comes a brief presentation, illustrated with simple animated charts, on how meat production is an inefficient way to produce food for a hungry world. This moves into footage of animal abuses on [[feedlot]]s and [[factory farm]]s and the pollution produced by these facilities. The film then focuses on the advantages of [[vegetarianism]] for reducing pollution and solving world hunger. With a change of diet toward vegetarianism, the film asserts, many of these environmental and health problems can be solved. After some fast-moving images of people and nature accompanied by music, the film ends with the same statement from Deuteronomy about "life and death," voiced over a sunrise.

==Production==
The idea for the film was inspired by the writings of Richard H. Schwartz ''(Judaism and Vegetarianism, Judaism and Global Survival, etc.)'' who also served as associate producer.&lt;ref&gt;From the DVD cover&lt;/ref&gt;  Schwartz had seen the [[Christian Vegetarian Association]]'s 2006 film, ''Honoring God's Creation'', and felt that a similar film would be effective in the Jewish community. At the time, he envisioned the film to be about 30&amp;nbsp;minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Richard, "Creating a 'Judaism and Vegetarianism' videotape," ''JVNA Online Newsletter,'' July 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Production began in 2005 with a basic proposal and outline in the JVNA's newsletter, along with a statement that Lionel Friedberg was willing to do it for "a very low fee, basically to cover his costs."&lt;ref&gt;JVNA Online Newsletter, Schwartz, Richard, "We Are Planning to Move Forward With the JVNA Video/Suggestions Welcome",July 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The film was underwritten by JVNA, through private contributions.&lt;ref&gt;A list of donors is in the film credits.&lt;/ref&gt;  Preliminary drafts of the script were circulated among members of the JVNA advisory committee and others for input and went through numerous revisions. Meanwhile, Schwartz and Friedberg set about interviewing possible participants and filming nature footage in both Israel and the United States. Some stock footage was also acquired.

The showing of slaughterhouse footage was controversial.  Some members of a test audience in [[Staten Island]], New York, branded it as [[propaganda]]. "Richard and I were accused of making a propaganda film for the vegetarian movement. We were accused of showing 'horrors that are impossible to watch,'" Friedberg recalls.&lt;ref name="jewishveg.blogspot.com"&gt;[http://jewishveg.blogspot.com/2011/08/08152011-jvna-online-newsletter.html Response from Lionel Friedberg, producer of "A Sacred Duty," ''JVNA Online Newsletter,'' August 8, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; But he felt the graphic footage was necessary. In contrasting his film with the more sanitized versions produced by the [[kosher meat]] industry, Friedberg stated: "To celebrate Judaism by depicting the assembly-line process by which animals are miraculously and happily turned into food for the [[Shabbat]] table without depicting the brutal cruelty and suffering that goes along with that process makes a mockery of the real meaning of our faith."&lt;ref name="jewishveg.blogspot.com"/&gt; The film opens with a warning that it contains material that might be disturbing to some viewers.

==Distribution==
''A Sacred Duty'' was released [[direct-to-video]] on [[DVD]], with public showings in both Israel and the United States, during October–November 2007. Over 35,000 copies were distributed free of charge to synagogues, educational institutions, and individuals, with permission to show the film without royalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishveg.com/schwartz/history.html http://jewishveg.com/schwartz/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, permission was granted to the public to duplicate and distribute it free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;From the DVD cover: ""This DVD may be shown, reproduced, and distributed freely."&lt;/ref&gt;  The full version was also posted on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Y9RxmTGHZgE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous short excerpts have also been edited and re-posted by various YouTube users.

'''''Animal''''' is a non-fiction [[coffee table book]] edited by [[David Burnie]], who was the main-editor, and several co-authors. The full title of the book is: '''''Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to The World's WildLife'''''. The 624-page book was published by [[Dorling Kindersley]] in 2001. The book is printed in full gloss paper and has numerous, full-color pictures.

The book is divided into several separate sections, each covering either a specific topic or a [[class (biology)|class]] of animals such as [[mammal]]s or [[reptile]]s. The introduction deals with how [[animal]]s are [[Taxonomic classification|classified]]. It also touches on [[ethology|animal behaviour]] and [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]s. Later content delves into the [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s of animals and how they live in them, [[Mammal]]s, [[Bird]]s, [[Reptile]]s, [[Amphibian]]s, [[Fish]], and [[Invertebrates]].

'''Stanley John Reed''', more commonly known as Bertie Reed was a South African yachtsman. He was the first South African to complete three singlehanded circumnavigations.&lt;ref name="SAS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sailing.org.za/default/team-sa3.php | title=Remembering Bertie Reed | accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Reed was born in Port Elizabeth in 1943.&lt;ref name="IOLObit"/&gt;

He joined the [[South African Navy]] in 1961 and served for 21 years. He started sailing whilst in the Navy.&lt;ref name="SANavy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.navy.mil.za/archive/0912/091208_bertie_reed/article.htm | title=Bertie Reed – The Legend Lives On | publisher=SA Navy | date=12 August 2009 | accessdate=1 April 2014 | author=Stone, Keith | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020020228/http://www.navy.mil.za/archive/0912/091208_bertie_reed/article.htm | archivedate=20 October 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1982/83 [[Velux 5 Oceans Race|BOC Challenge]] race he placed second in the Knysna built yacht, Voortrekker.&lt;ref name="IOLObit"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/sa-skipper-bertie-reed-dies-at-63-1.308070#.Uzq4aVfdEp8 | title=SA skipper Bertie Reed dies at 63 | publisher=IOL | date=19 December 2006| accessdate=1 April 2014| author=Williams, Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Voortrekker was 14 years old and considered obsolete.&lt;ref name="SAS" /&gt;

In the [[Velux_5_Oceans_Race#The_BOC_Challenge_1986–87|1986–87]] race he was placed 7th, sailing ''Stabilo Boss'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solocircumnavigation.com/SoloAroundTheWorldRaces/BOC_And_AA_Races/BOC82_83/bocchallenge_1986_1987_results.htm|title=The BOC Challenge 1986–1987 Results|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a yacht subsequently raced as ''[[Maiden (yacht)|Maiden]]''.

He was awarded South Africa's highest civilian award for bravery, the Wolraad Woltemade Decoration for his rescue of sailor John Martin whose yacht sank after hitting a submerged iceberg in the Southern Ocean during the 1990–91 BOC Challenge.&lt;ref name="SANavy" /&gt;

In 2006 he was inducted into the Single-Handed Sailors' Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="HoF"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.windlasscreative.com/shshof_web/bertie_reed.htm | title=Bertie Reed – Hall of Fame | accessdate=2 April 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129142947/http://www.windlasscreative.com/shshof_web/bertie_reed.htm | archivedate=29 November 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IOLHall"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/sport/us-award-for-solo-sa-sailing-hero-1.558609?ot=inmsa.ArticlePrintPageLayout.ot | title=US award for solo SA sailing hero | publisher=IOL | date=8 June 2006| accessdate=1 April 2014| author=Chisholm, Fiona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sail-World"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sail-world.com/Europe/index.cfm?SEID=0&amp;Nid=21420&amp;SRCID=0&amp;ntid=0&amp;tickeruid=0&amp;tickerCID=0 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20140401134057/http://www.sail-world.com/Europe/index.cfm?SEID=0&amp;Nid=21420&amp;SRCID=0&amp;ntid=0&amp;tickeruid=0&amp;tickerCID=0 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=1 April 2014 | title=2006 Inductees SingleHanded Sailors Hall of Fame | accessdate=1 April 2014 | author=Santos, Sally Ann }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:bouvettriplenarrow3d.svg|thumb|Seafloor model around the Bouvet Triple Junction]]
The '''Bouvet Triple Junction''' is a geologic [[triple junction]] of three [[tectonic]] plates located on the seafloor of the South [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is named after [[Bouvet Island]], which lies 275 kilometers to the east. The three plates which meet here are the [[South American Plate]], the [[African Plate]], and the [[Antarctic Plate]]. The Bouvet Triple Junction is an R-R-R type, that is, the three plate boundaries which meet here are [[mid-ocean ridge]]s: the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] (MAR), the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]] (SWIR), and the [[South American-Antarctic Ridge]] (SAAR).

==Transform valleys==
There are two prominent [[transform fault|transform valleys]] in the area: Conrad transform and Bouvet transform. Conrad transform is named after {{ship|USNS|Robert D. Conrad|T-AGOR-3}}. Bouvet Island is the highest point on the southern wall of the Bouvet transform.

==Development==
Up to 10 million years ago the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the two deep transform valleys of Conrad and Bouvet met in one point. Thus the triple junction was of the ridge-fault-fault (RFF) type. Conrad transform, stretching to the west, connected the end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the South American-Antarctic Ridge. Bouvet transform linked it to the Southwest Indian Ridge on the eastern side.

Currently Conrad transform and Bouvet transform are no longer connected to each other. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is retreating northward, at a rate of {{Convert|11|mm/yr|abbr=on|in/year}}. New spreading sections of the South American-Antarctic Ridge and the Southwest Indian Ridge are growing northward from the eastern end of Conrad transform and the western end of Bouvet transform respectively, striving for the shifting triple point. Thus the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is opening like a [[zipper]]. The new spreading sections are somewhat unusual:
* One new spreading section of the South American-Antarctic Ridge is not perpendicular to Conrad fault, violating the perpendicular pattern of alternating spreading ridges and transform faults generally seen on slowly spreading oceanic ridges.
* The new part of the Southwest Indian Ridge is masked by the recently formed Spiess Seamount. This volcanic seamount is the highest point in the area after Bouvet Island. Spiess Seamount was named after [[Captain (naval)|captain]] Fritz Spieß of the [[German Meteor expedition]] of 1926.

'''Saint Mary of Blachernae''' (full name in [[Greek language|Greek]]: Θεοτόκος των Βλαχερνών (pr. ''Theotókos ton Vlachernón''); [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name: ''Meryem Ana Kilisesi'')  is an [[Eastern Orthodox]] church in [[Istanbul]]. The little edifice, built in 1867, got the same dedication as the shrine erected in this place in the fifth century which, until its destruction in 1434, was one of the most important sanctuaries of [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek]] [[Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;The importance of the Church can be – among others – argued from the fact that along the whole Orthodox world (from [[Crete]] to [[Chersonesus Taurica|Cherson]] in [[Crimea]]) many churches were put under the same dedication. Janin (1953), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The church is located in [[Istanbul]], in the district of [[Fatih]], in the neighbourhood of [[Ayvansaray, Istanbul|Ayvansaray]], along ''Mustafa Paşa Bostanı Sokak''. It lies a few hundred meters inside the [[walls of Constantinople|walled]] city, at a short distance from the shore of the [[Golden Horn]]. The building is protected by a high wall, and preceded by a garden.

==History==
[[File:To agiasma ton vlahernon.JPG|200px|thumb|The Hagiasma of Blachernae in a drawing of 1877, from A.G. Paspates' ''Byzantine topographical studies'']]
In 450, [[Roman Emperor|Empress]] [[Pulcheria|Aelia Pulcheria]] started to build a church near a fountain of [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|holy water]] ({{lang-el|script=latn|Ayíasma}}) situated outside the [[Walls of Constantinople#Theodosian Walls|walls of Theodosius II]] at the foot of the sixth hill of [[Constantinople]]. After her death in 453, the shrine was completed by her husband, Emperor [[Marcian]].&lt;ref name=ja169&gt;Janin (1953), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] erected near the church two other buildings: a [[parekklesion]],&lt;ref&gt;The ''parekklesion'' is a [[chapel]] leaning to the side of the church or of the narthex.&lt;/ref&gt; named ''Ayía Sorós'' ("holy reliquary"), since it hosted the holy mantle and robe of the Virgin brought from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 473, and the ''´Ayion Loúsma'' ("sacred bath") edifice, which enclosed the fountain.&lt;ref name=ja169/&gt;

The importance assumed by the whole complex encouraged the Emperors to lodge in the surroundings and to build there the nucleus of what would in later centuries become the imperial palace of Blachernae.&lt;ref name=mw&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; During the first quarter of the 6th century, Emperors [[Justin I]] and [[Justinian I]] restored and enlarged the church.&lt;ref name=ja169/&gt; The name of Blachernae may come from old name of Romanians (Vlach, Blac, etc.) and from a small colony of vlachs&lt;ref name=gh&gt;Gherghel (1920), p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Mary hosted a famous [[icon]] of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin]], named after the church ''[[Blachernitissa|Vlachernítissa]]''. It was painted on wood and revetted with gold and silver. This icon and the [[relics]] of the Virgin kept in the parekklesion were considered by the Byzantines as most powerful, useful during a war or in case of natural disasters. The first proof of the power of these objects came in 626. During that year Constantinople was [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|besieged]] by the combined armies of the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] and the [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]], while Emperor [[Heraclius]] was away, fighting the Persians in Mesopotamia. The son of the Emperor, [[Constantine III (Byzantine emperor)|Constantine]], together with Patriarch [[Sergius I of Constantinople|Sergius]] and Patrician Bonus carried in procession along the ramparts the icon of the Blachernitissa. Some time later the fleet of the Avars was destroyed.&lt;ref name=ja170&gt;Janin (1953), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Avars afterwards said that he had been frightened by the vision of a young woman adorned with jewels scouring the walls.&lt;ref name=ja170/&gt;

After the end of the siege, the Byzantines learned with joy that the building of the church, which at that time lay outside the Walls, was the only one not to have been plundered by the invaders.&lt;ref name=ja170/&gt; When the victorious Heraclius came back to Constantinople, bringing back the [[True Cross]] which had been captured by the Persians in Jerusalem, the Patriarch received him at Saint Mary. Sometime later, the Emperor built a [[Walls of Constantinople#Walls of Blachernae|single wall]] to protect the church, thus enclosing in the City the suburb of Blachernae.&lt;ref name=mw&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Constantinople mediaeval map.jpg|200px|thumb|Map of Constantinople around 1420, after [[Cristoforo Buondelmonti]]. The District of Blachernae can be seen on the center left part of the map, surrounded on two sides by the walls of the City, below the Golden Horn.]]

The protection of the Virgin of the Blachernae was also credited with the Byzantine victories during the [[Siege of Constantinople (718)|Arab siege of 717-718]], and in 860, during the [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|invasion of the Rus']]. In this occasion, the [[The Protection of the Mother of God#Tradition|Veil of the Virgin]] (''mafórion''), which by that time had joined the other relics in the church, was shortly plunged in the sea to invoke the protection of God on the fleet.&lt;ref name=ja171&gt;Janin (1953), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Each year on 2 July the great feast of the ''deposition of the Veil'' (its transport from Jerusalem to Constantinople) took place in the church. Janin (1953), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Some days later the Rus' fleet was destroyed. In 926 too, during the war against [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon of Bulgaria]], the potency of the relics of the Virgin helped convince the Bulgarian Tsar to negotiate with the Byzantines instead of assaulting the City.&lt;ref name=ja171&gt;Janin (1953), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 944, the church received other two important objects: the letter written by King [[Abgar V of Edessa]] to [[Jesus]] and the [[Image of Edessa|Mandylion]]. Both relics were then moved to the [[Church of the Virgin of the Pharos]].&lt;ref name=ja172&gt;Janin (1953), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Mary, being a centre of the veneration of the Images, played also an important role in the religious fights of the Byzantines. During the [[Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic period]], the final session of the [[Council of Hieria]], where the cult of the images was condemned, took place in the church.&lt;ref name=ja171/&gt; As a consequence of that decision, Emperor [[Constantine V]] ordered the [[Mosaic#Byzantine mosaics|mosaics]] of the interior destroyed, and substituted them with others representing natural scenes with trees, birds and animals.&lt;ref name=ja175&gt;Janin (1953), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; On that occasion the Icon of the Blachernitissa was also hidden under a layer of silvery mortar.&lt;ref name=ja169/&gt; In 843, with the [[Triumph of Orthodoxy|end of Iconoclasm]], the [[Feast of Orthodoxy]] was celebrated for the first time in the church of Blachernae with an ''Agrypnía'' ("holy [[Vigil]]"), which occurred on the first Sunday of [[Lent]].&lt;ref name=ja171/&gt;

The Blachernitissa was discovered again during restoration works executed during the reign of [[Romanos III|Romanos III Argyros]],&lt;ref&gt;On that occasion Romanos also covered the capitals of the columns with gold and silver foil. Janin (1953), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; and became again one of the most venerated icons of Constantinople. The Church of Saint Mary was completely destroyed during a fire in 1070, and was rebuilt by [[Romanos IV| Romanos IV Diogenes]] and [[Michael VII|Michael VII Doukas]] respecting the old plan.&lt;ref name=ja170/&gt;

According to [[Anna Komnene]], the so-called "habitual miracle" ({{lang-el|to synetís thavma}}) occurred in the church before the Icon of the Virgin Blachernitissa.&lt;ref name=ja174&gt;Janin (1953), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday after sunset, when the church was empty, the veil which covered the icon moved up slowly, revealing the face of the Virgin, while 24 hours later it fell again slowly. Anyway, the miracle did not occur regularly, and ceased completely after the [[Fourth Crusade|Latin conquest]] of the City.&lt;ref name=ja174/&gt;

After the [[Fourth Crusade|Latin invasion of 1204]], the church was occupied by the Latin clergy and placed directly under the [[Holy See]]. Already before the end of the [[Latin Empire]], [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] redeemed the church and many monasteries for the Orthodox clergy in exchange for money.&lt;ref name=ja172&gt;Janin (1953), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 29, 1434, some noble children who were hunting pigeons on the roof of the church accidentally started a fire, which destroyed the whole complex and the surrounding quarter.&lt;ref name=ja170/&gt; The area was largely neglected during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]]. In 1867, the Guild of the Orthodox [[furrier]]s bought the parcel around the holy fountain, and built there a small church.

== Description ==
The religious complex of Blachernae comprised three edifices: The Church of Saint Mary, the Chapel of the reliquary (''Ayía Sorós''), and the Sacred Bath (''´Ayion Loúsma'').&lt;ref name=ja174/&gt;

The church proper, defined by all the sources as "large" (''mégas naós''), was of [[basilica]] type, with the space divided into three aisles by two [[colonnade]]s. This plan is similar to that of other churches of the early type in Constantinople like [[Monastery of Stoudios|St. John of Stoudios]]. It had a rectangular plan with sides of 96 m and 36 m.&lt;ref name=ja175&gt;Janin (1953), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian apparently built a dome on the church, since Procopius, in his work ''De Edificiis'', mentions that both colonnades bent in the middle of the [[nave]] describing a semicircle.&lt;ref name=ja169/&gt; Emperor [[Justin II]] added the two side arms, giving to the plan the appearance of a cross.&lt;ref&gt;Two [[epigrams]] of the ''[[Anthologia Palatina]]'' remember this fact. Janin (1953), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstruction of 1070 possibly respected this plan. The Spanish ambassador [[Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo]], who visited Constantinople in 1402, writes that the building was divided into three aisles, with the central higher than the flanking ones. The columns were made of [[Jasper|green Jasper]], while the capitals and the bases of the columns were gilded and carved in white marble.&lt;ref name=ja175&gt;Janin (1953), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The church by that time had no dome anymore, but a multicoloured compartmented ceiling, decorated with golden garlands.&lt;ref name=ja175/&gt;

[[File:vlahernskaya.jpg|thumb|The alleged ''Vlachernítissa'' [[Icon]] of the [[Theotokos]], kept in [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Dormition Cathedral]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]].]]

The walls at that time were covered with coloured marble panels, while originally a silvery [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] was used.&lt;ref name=ja174/&gt; Near the middle of the nave, there was a silver [[Ambon (liturgy)|ambon]], while at the end lied a rich [[iconostasis]] surrounded by sculptures.&lt;ref name=ja175/&gt; On the upper part of the walls, there were mosaics representing the miracles of Christ and several episodes of his life up to his [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]].&lt;ref name=ja175/&gt; To the church belonged also tribunes and an oratory. The shrine communicated through a porticus and a stairway with the imperial Palace of Blachernae, which – lying on the slope of the hill – overlooked it.&lt;ref name=ja176&gt;Janin (1953), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the right of the church lied the ''parekklísion'' of the ''Ayía Sorós'', which contained the dress and robe of the Virgin. The veil and a part of [[Cincture of the Theotokos|her belt]] (now at [[Vatopedi monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]]), were later also kept there. The building was round and had a [[narthex]] and tribunes.&lt;ref name=ja176/&gt; An icon of the Virgin donated by Emperor Leo I and his wife [[Verina]] was also worshipped there. On its right was kept the casket – adorned with gold and silver – which contained the relics.&lt;ref name=ja176/&gt; They were rescued from the Latin occupation, and after the restoration of the Empire were kept in the church, but were all destroyed during the fire of 1434.&lt;ref name=ja176/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A pious legend says that the Blachernitissa survived the disaster, and that after 1453 it was brought to a monastery on [[Mount Athos]] and finally to Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''bath'' where the Emperor immersed himself comprised three parts: the robing room where he undressed, the ''kólymbos'' (pool for immersion) and the hall of Saint Photinos. It lay to the right of the parekklesion, and communicated with it through a door.&lt;ref name=ma308&gt;Mamboury (1953), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; The pool consisted of a large room surmounted by a dome with the basin in the middle. It was adorned with icons, and the water poured in the basin from the hands of a marble statue of the Virgin. An Image of Saint Photinos decorated the centre of the dome.&lt;ref name=ma308/&gt; Each year, on August 15 (the feast of [[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]]), after the adoration of the ''Mafórion'' (holy veil) of the Virgin, the Emperor plunged three times in the sacred pool.&lt;ref name=ma308/&gt;

The small church which today encloses the Hagiasma has a trapezoidal plan with sloping roof, and is adorned with icons and frescoes. It is oriented in northwest-southeast direction. The holy fountain, which is believed to have healing powers, is always a favourite destination for Orthodox and Muslim pilgrims, who pour in the pool coins and hair pins.&lt;ref name=ma308/&gt; The pilgrim can also ritually wash his eyes at a line of  faucets.&lt;ref name=ro715&gt;Ronchey (2010), p. 715&lt;/ref&gt; Above them a modern [[palindrome]] inscription says: "[[Nipson anomemata me monan opsin|''Nípson anomímata mi mónan ópsin'']]" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: "Wash the sins not only the eyes").&lt;ref name=ro715/&gt; The water falls into an underground gallery, which according to a tradition links the Hagiasma with [[Church of St. Mary of the Spring (Istanbul)|that in Balıklı]].&lt;ref name=ro715 /&gt;  The church is run by an [[Bishop|episkopos]] and two [[Priest#Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy|papades]].&lt;ref name=ro714&gt;Ronchey (2010), p. 714&lt;/ref&gt; Each Friday morning the [[Akathist]] [[Hymn]], composed by [[Sergius I of Constantinople|Patriarch Sergius]] during the [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|Siege of 626]], is sung there.&lt;ref name=ro715 /&gt; Since the nearby area is not urbanized, it would be possible to explore it in order to understand more about the ancient complex.

A '''dust storm''' is a [[meteorological phenomenon]] common in [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]] regions. Dust storms arise when a [[Outflow boundary|gust front]] or other strong wind blows loose sand and [[dirt]] from a dry surface. Fine particles are transported by [[Saltation (geology)|saltation]] and suspension, a process that moves soil from one place and [[Deposition (sediment)|deposits]] it in another.

[[Drylands]] around [[North Africa]] and the [[Arabian peninsula]] are the main terrestrial sources of airborne dust. It has been argued that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eslamian|first1=Saeid|last2=Eslamian|first2=Faezeh|title=Handbook of Drought and Water Scarcity: Management of Drought and Water Scarcity|date=2017|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-351-85113-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46QzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT942|accessdate=4 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=January 2018}} poor management of the Earth's drylands, such as neglecting the [[fallow]] system, are increasing dust storms size and frequency from desert margins and changing both the local and global climate, and also impacting local economies.&lt;ref name="vrs"&gt;{{cite web

The term ''sandstorm'' is used most often in the context of [[desert]] sandstorms, especially in the [[Sahara Desert]], or places where sand is a more prevalent soil type than dirt or rock, when, in addition to fine particles obscuring visibility, a considerable amount of larger sand particles are blown closer to the surface. The term ''dust storm'' is more likely to be used when finer particles are blown long distances, especially when the dust storm affects [[urban area]]s.

==Causes==
As the force of wind passing over loosely held particles increases, particles of sand first start to vibrate, then to [[Saltation (geology)|saltate]] ("leaps"). As they repeatedly strike the ground, they loosen and break off smaller particles of dust which then begin to travel in suspension. At wind speeds above that which causes the smallest to suspend, there will be a population of dust grains moving by a range of mechanisms: suspension, saltation and [[Downhill creep|creep]].&lt;ref name="vrs" /&gt;

A study from 2008 finds that the initial saltation of sand particles induces a static electric field by friction. Saltating sand acquires a negative charge relative to the ground which in turn loosens more sand particles which then begin saltating. This process has been found to double the number of particles predicted by previous theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-01/uom-esf010708.php |title=Electric Sand Findings, University of Michigan Jan. 6, 2008 |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date=2008-01-07 |accessdate=2016-12-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520031124/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-01/uom-esf010708.php |archivedate=2016-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particles become loosely held mainly due to a prolonged drought or arid conditions, and high wind speeds. Gust fronts may be produced by the outflow of rain-cooled air from an intense thunderstorm. Or, the wind gusts may be produced by a dry [[cold front]], that is, a cold front that is moving into a dry air mass and is producing no [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]—the type of dust storm which was common during the [[Dust Bowl]] years in the U.S. Following the passage of a dry cold front, [[convection|convective]] instability resulting from cooler air riding over heated ground can maintain the dust storm initiated at the front.

In desert areas, dust and sand storms are most commonly caused by either thunderstorm outflows, or by strong pressure gradients which cause an increase in wind velocity over a wide area. The vertical extent of the dust or sand that is raised is largely determined by the stability of the atmosphere above the ground as well as by the weight of the particulates. In some cases, dust and sand may be confined to a relatively shallow layer by a low-lying [[temperature inversion]]. In other instances, dust (but not sand) may be lifted as high as 20,000&amp;nbsp;feet (6,100&amp;nbsp;m) high.

[[Drought]] and [[wind]] contribute to the emergence of dust storms, as do poor [[farming]] and grazing practices by exposing the dust and sand to the wind.

One poor farming practice which contributes to dust storms is [[dryland farming]]. Particularly poor dryland farming techniques are [[Tillage#Intensive tillage|intensive tillage]] or not having established [[crop]]s or [[cover crop]]s when storms strike at particularly vulnerable times prior to [[revegetation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dust Storms Chapter |url=http://csc.uoregon.edu/opdr/sites/csc.uoregon.edu.opdr/files/docs/ORNHMP/OR-SNHMP_%2520dust-storms_chapter.pdf |work=Emergency Management Plan |publisher=State of Oregon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021013222/http://csc.uoregon.edu/opdr/sites/csc.uoregon.edu.opdr/files/docs/ORNHMP/OR-SNHMP_%20dust-storms_chapter.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a semi-arid climate, these practices increase susceptibility to dust storms. However, [[soil conservation]] practices may be implemented to control wind erosion.

A sandstorm can transport and carry large volumes of sand unexpectedly. Dust storms can carry large amounts of dust, with the leading edge being composed of a wall of thick dust as much as {{convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} high. Dust and sand storms which come off the [[Sahara Desert]] are locally known as a [[simoom]] or simoon (sîmūm, sîmūn). The ''[[haboob]]'' (həbūb) is a sandstorm prevalent in the region of [[Sudan]] around [[Khartoum]], with occurrences being most common in the summer.

The [[Sahara]] desert is a key source of dust storms, particularly the [[Bodélé Depression]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/1/1/014005|title=The Bodélé depression: A single spot in the Sahara that provides most of the mineral dust to the Amazon forest|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=1|pages=014005|year=2006|last1=Koren|first1=Ilan|last2=Kaufman|first2=Yoram J|last3=Washington|first3=Richard|last4=Todd|first4=Martin C|last5=Rudich|first5=Yinon|last6=Martins|first6=J Vanderlei|last7=Rosenfeld|first7=Daniel|bibcode=2006ERL.....1a4005K}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an area covering the confluence of [[Mauritania]], [[Mali]], and [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3650666 |doi=10.1111/1475-5661.00013|title=Saharan dust: Sources and trajectories|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|volume=26|issue=2|pages=165|year=2001|last1=Middleton|first1=N.

Saharan dust storms have increased approximately 10-fold during the half-century since the 1950s, causing topsoil loss in [[Niger]], [[Chad]], northern [[Nigeria]], and [[Burkina Faso]].{{Fact|date=May 2018}} In Mauritania there were just two dust storms a year in the early 1960s, but there are about 80 a year today, according to Andrew Goudie, a professor of geography at Oxford University.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R.

Short-term effects of exposure to desert dust include immediate increased [[symptoms]] and worsening of the [[lung function]] in individuals with [[asthma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1843.2005.00728.x|pmid=16135170|title=Effects of ambient particulate matter on peak expiratory flow rates and respiratory symptoms of asthmatics during Asian dust periods in Korea|journal=Respirology|volume=10|issue=4|pages=470|year=2005|last1=Park|first1=Jeong Woong|last2=Lim|first2=Young Hee|last3=Kyung|first3=Sun Young|last4=An|first4=Chang Hyeok|last5=Lee|first5=Sang Pyo|last6=Jeong|first6=Seong Hwan|last7=Ju|first7=Young-Su}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased [[mortality rate|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] from long-transported dust from both Saharan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/EDE.0b013e31818131cf|pmid=18938653|title=Coarse Particles from Saharan Dust and Daily Mortality|journal=Epidemiology|volume=19|issue=6|pages=800|year=2008|last1=Perez|first1=Laura|last2=Tobias|first2=Aurelio|last3=Querol|first3=Xavier|last4=Künzli|first4=Nino|last5=Pey|first5=Jorge|last6=Alastuey|first6=Andrés|last7=Viana|first7=Mar|last8=Valero|first8=Natalia|last9=González-Cabré|first9=Manuel|last10=Sunyer|first10=Jordi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Asian dust]] storms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.06.046|title=Effect of Asian dust storms on daily mortality in seven metropolitan cities of Korea|journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=79|pages=510|year=2013|last1=Lee|first1=Hyewon|last2=Kim|first2=Ho|last3=Honda|first3=Yasushi|last4=Lim|first4=Youn-Hee|last5=Yi|first5=Seungmuk|bibcode=2013AtmEn..79..510L}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that long-transported dust storm particles adversely affects the circulatory system. [[Dust pneumonia]] is the result of large amounts of dust being inhaled.

Prolonged and unprotected exposure of the [[respiratory system]] in a dust storm can also cause [[silicosis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2013.10.011 |pmid=24275707 |title=Desert dust and human health disorders |journal=Environment International |volume=63 |pages=101–13 |year=2014 |last1=Goudie |first1=Andrew S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, if left untreated, will lead to [[asphyxia]]tion; silicosis is an incurable condition that may also lead to [[lung cancer]]. There is also the danger of [[keratoconjunctivitis sicca]] ("dry eyes") which, in severe cases without immediate and proper treatment, can lead to [[blindness]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Economic impact===
Dust storms cause soil loss from the dry lands, and worse, they preferentially remove organic matter and the nutrient-rich lightest particles, thereby reducing agricultural productivity. Also the abrasive effect of the storm damages young crop plants. Dust storms also reduced visibility affecting aircraft and road transportation. In addition dust storms also create problems due to complications of breathing in dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Dust Between Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, Iraq| publisher =Earth Snapshot| date =March 3, 2012| url =http://www.eosnap.com/image-of-the-day/dust-between-tigris-and-euphrates-rivers-iraq-march-3rd-2012/| accessdate =2013-11-20| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140529051915/http://www.eosnap.com/image-of-the-day/dust-between-tigris-and-euphrates-rivers-iraq-march-3rd-2012/| archivedate =May 29, 2014| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dust can also have beneficial effects where it deposits: Central and South American rain forests get most of their mineral nutrients from the Sahara; iron-poor ocean regions get iron; and dust in Hawaii increases [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] growth. In northern China as well as the mid-western U.S., ancient dust storm deposits known as [[loess]] are highly fertile soils, but they are also a significant source of contemporary dust storms when soil-securing vegetation is disturbed.{{verify source|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the Dust Bowl|work=Mishe Vanatta|url=http://atlantisonline.smfforfree2.com/index.php?topic=15424.5;wap2|accessdate=2013-11-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235528/http://atlantisonline.smfforfree2.com/index.php?topic=15424.5;wap2|archivedate=2013-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|date=May 2016}}{{better source|date=May 2016}}

|[[Shortfin mako shark]] || {{convert|45|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}}{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} || Underwater and unimpeded by a fishing line, the Shortfin Mako has been reliably clocked at 31 miles (50 kilometres) per hour, and there is a claim that one individual of this species achieved a burst speed of 46 miles (74 kilometres) per hour. But it is extremely difficult to get a fish in the wild to swim in a straight line over a measured course. Laboratory measurements of numerous kinds of fishes — representing a wide range of body sizes — swimming against an artificial current have revealed a surprisingly uniform maximum burst speed of about 10 times the body length per second. Thus, for an average-sized, 6.5-foot (2-metre) Shortfin, its theoretical maximum speed might be something on the order of 45 miles (72 kilometres) per hour. Yet some estimates of the top-speed of a Shortfin Mako are considerably higher.

'''Fecundity selection''', also known as '''fertility selection''', is the fitness advantage resulting from the preference of traits that increase the number of offspring (i.e. [[fecundity]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] formulated the theory of fecundity selection between 1871 and 1874 to explain the widespread evolution of female-biased [[Sexual dimorphism|sexual size dimorphism]] (SSD), where females were larger than males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Descent of man, and selection in relation to sex.|last1=Darwin|first1=C.|date=1874|publisher=Murray|year=|isbn=|edition=Second|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Along with the theories of [[natural selection]] and [[sexual selection]], fecundity selection is a fundamental component of the modern theory of Darwinian selection. Fecundity selection is distinct&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clegg|first1=M. T.|last2=Allard|first2=R. W.|title=Viability versus Fecundity Selection in the Slender Wild Oat, ''Avena barbata'' L. |journal=Science|date=1973|volume=181|issue=4100|pages=667–668|doi=10.1126/science.181.4100.667|pmid=17736981}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that large female size relates to the ability to accommodate more offspring, and a higher capacity for energy storage to be invested in reproduction. Darwin’s theory of fecundity selection predicts the following:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

# Fecundity depends on variation in female size, which is associated with fitness. 
# Strong fecundity selection favors large female size, which creates asymmetrical female-biased sexual size dimorphism.

Although [[sexual selection]] and fecundity selection are distinct, it still may be difficult to interpret whether sexual dimorphism in nature is due to fecundity selection, or to sexual selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olsson|first1=Mats|last2=Shine|first2=Richard|last3=Wapstra|first3=Erik|last4=Ujvari|first4=Beata|last5=Madsen|first5=Thomas |title=Sexual Dimorphism In Lizard Body Shape: The Roles Of Sexual Selection And Fecundity Selection |journal=Evolution|date=July 2002|volume=56|issue=7|pages=1538–1542|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb01464.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serrano-Meneses|first1=Martín-Alejandro|last2=Székely|first2=Tamás|title=Sexual size dimorphism in seabirds: sexual selection, fecundity selection and differential niche-utilisation|journal=Oikos|date=June 2006|volume=113|issue=3|pages=385–394|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.14246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of fecundity selection in nature include [[self-incompatibility]] [[Flowering plant|flowering plants]], where pollen of some potential mates are not effective in forming seed,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mate Availability and Fecundity Selection in Multi-Allelic Self- Incompatibility Systems in Plants|year=1998|authors=Vekemans, X.; Schierup, M.H.; Christiansen, F.B.|journal=Evolution|volume=52|issue=1|pages=19–29|doi=10.2307/2410916|jstor=2410916}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as bird, lizard, fly, and butterfly and moth species that are spread across an ecological gradient.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Allen, CE. et. al.

== Moreau-Lack's rule ==
[[Reginald Ernest Moreau|Moreau]] (1944) suggested that in more seasonal environments or higher latitudes, fecundity depends on high mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, RE. Clutch-size: a comparative study, with special reference to African birds. ''Ibis'' '''86''', 286-347 (1944)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Lack|Lack]] (1954) suggested differential food availability and management across latitudes play a role in offspring and parental fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, D. The natural regulation of animal numbers. ''Clarendon Press, Oxford'' (1954)&lt;/ref&gt; Lack also highlighted that more opportunities for parents to collect food due to an increase in day-length towards the poles is an advantage. This means that moderately higher altitudes provide more successful conditions to produce more offspring. However, extreme day-lengths (i.e. at the poles) may work against parental survival as repetitive food searching would exhaust the parent.

Together, the Moreau-Lack rule hypothesizes that fecundity increases with increasing latitude.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pincheira-Donoso, D. and Hunt, J. Fecundity selection theory: concepts and evidence. ''Biological Reviews'' '''92''', 341-356 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence supporting and doubting this claim has led to the consolidation of other predictions, which may better explain Moreau-Lack's rule.

=== Seasonality and Ashmole's hypothesis ===
[[Philip Ashmole|Ashmole]] (1963) suggested (bird) fecundity depends on seasonality patterns.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ashmole, NP. The regulation of numbers of tropical oceanic birds. ''Ibis'' '''103b''', 458-473 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; Food differences in availability between seasons are greater towards higher latitudes, so birds are predicted to experience low survival during the winter due to limited resources. This decline in population may be advantageous for survivors, since there is more food available by the next breeding season. This leads to an enhancement of energy when invested in fitness as a result of higher fecundity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, Ashmole's hypothesis is dependent upon resource availability as a factor fecundity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differences in nest predation ===
Areas with severe nest [[predation]] tend to be those of large clutches/litters, especially in the tropics&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, as they are more noticeable to predators (frequent parental care, noisier offspring&lt;ref&gt;Slagsvold, T. Clutch size variation in passerine birds: the nest predation hypothesis. ''Oecologia'' '''54''', 159-169 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slagsvold, T. Clutch size variation in birds in relation to nest predation: on the cost of reproduction. ''Journal of Animal Ecology'''''53''', 945-953 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Skutch, AF. Do tropical birds rear as many young as they can nourish?. ''Ibis'' '''91''', 430-455 (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;). This predation pressure may lead to the selection for multiple nests of smaller size, with shorter development time. 

A criticism of this hypothesis is that it indirectly assumes that these nest-predators are visually-oriented, however, they may be chemically-oriented, too, with heightened olfactory senses. 

=== Length of breeding season (LBS) hypothesis ===
Populations at higher latitudes experience a increasing seasonality and shorter warm seasons. As a result, these populations have more chances of having multiple reproductive episodes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Intense fecundity selection depends on the length of breeding season (LBS). Factors that may delay LBS or the start of breeding season, are snow cover or delayed food growth, which, in turn, minimizes the chance for these populations to reproduce. 

Long breeding seasons towards the tropics favor smaller clutches since females are able to balance energy reserved for reproduction, and the risk of predation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Fecundity selection acts by favoring early reproduction and higher clutch size in species that reproduce frequently. The opposite trend is seen in populations that reproduce less frequently, where delayed reproduction is favored. 

=== The 'bet-hedging strategy' hypothesis ===
The total fecundity per year depends on the length of breeding season (LBS), which also determines the number of breeding episodes. In addition, the total fecundity also depends on nest predation, as it describes differential survival over a variety of populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griebeler, EM. et. al. Evolution of avian clutch size along latitudinal gradients: do seasonality, nest predation or breeding season length matter? ''Journal of Evolutionary Biology'' '''23''', 888-901 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; When food is limited, and the breeding season is long, and nest predation is intense, selection tends to favor a 'bet-hedging' strategy, where the risk of predation is spread over many smaller clutches. This means that the success of the number of offspring depends on whether they are large in size or not. The strategy suggests that fewer, but larger, clutches in higher latitudes are a result of food seasonality, nest predation, and LBS.

== In nature ==
The findings below are based on individual research studies.

=== Southern and Northern Hemisphere birds ===

It has been assumed that parents of fewer offspring, with a high probability of adult survival, should permit less risk to themselves. Even though this compromises their young, the overall fitness of their offspring is reduced, which is a strategy to invest in producing more offspring in the future. It was found that within and between regions, there is a negative correlation between [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] size and adult survival. [[Southern Hemisphere|Southern-Hemisphere]] parents were inclined to reduce mortality risk to themselves, even at a cost to their offspring, whereas [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] parents experienced greater risk to themselves to reduce risk to their offspring.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Ghalambor, CK., and Martin, TE. Fecundity-Survival Trade-Offs and Parental Risk-Taking in Birds. ''Science'' '''292''' (5516), 494-497 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in wing size, wing shape, wing color pattern, the size and shape of antennae and of body hairs, as well as abdominal characteristics in butterfly. Females (right) are overall much larger than males (left) |343x343px]]
=== ''Liolaemus'' lizard ===
''[[Liolaemus]]'' species span from the [[Atacama Desert]] to austral rain forests and [[Patagonia]], and across a wide range of altitudes. Due to radiation, life history strategies have diversified within this genus&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Pinchiera-Donoso, D., Tregenza, T. Fecundity selection and the evolution of reproductive output and sex-specific body size in the ''Liolaemus'' lizard adaptive radiation. ''Evolutionary Biology'' '''38''': 197-207 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;. In turn, it was found that increased fecundity does not lead to female-biased SSD, which is also not effected by latitude-elevation.
=== ''Drosophila melanogaster'' ===
In lines of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|D. melanogaster]]'' selected for increased fecundity (i.e. more eggs laid over an 18-hour period), females experienced an increase in thorax and abdomen width than males.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Reeve, JP. and Fairbairn, DJ. Change in sexual size dimoprhism as a correlated response to selection on fecundity. ''Heredity'' '''83''', 697-706 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In general, SSD increased with selection for increased fecundity. These results support the hypothesis that in response to fecundity selection, SSD can evolve rapidly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== ''Lepidoptera'' butterfly and moth species ===
Female-biased SSD in many [[Lepidoptera|Lepidopteran]] species are initiated during their developmental period. Since females of this species, as in many other species, reserve their larval resources for reproduction, fecundity depends on larger (female) size. In this way, larger females can enhance fecundity as well as their survival by having multiple partners.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Other types of selection ==
Natural selection is defined as the differential survival and/or reproduction or organisms as a function of their physical attributes, where their 'fitness' is the ability to adapt to the environment and produce more (fertile) offspring.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/~barrylab/classes/animal_behavior/SELECT.HTM "Introduction to Natural and Sexual Selection"]. ''bio.research.ucsc.edu''. Retrieved 2018-03-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The trait(s) that contribute to survival or reproduction of offspring has a higher chance of being expressed in the population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_25 "Natural selection"]. ''evolution.berkeley.edu''. Retrieved 2018-03-29.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sexual selection acts to refine secondary sexual (i.e. non-genital) phenotypes, such as the morphological differences between males and females (sexual dimorphism), or even differences between species of the same sex&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. As a refinement to Darwin's theory of selection, Trivers (1974) observed that:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, RL. Parent-Offspring Conflict. ''Integrative and Comparative Biology'' '''14'''(1), 249-264 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

# Females are the limiting sex and invest more in offspring than males
# Because males tend to be in excess, males tend to develop ornaments for attracting mates ([[female choice]]), as well competing with other males.

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Fontus''' or '''Fons''' (plural ''Fontes'', "Font" or "Source") was a god of wells and springs. A [[Roman festivals|religious festival]] called the '''Fontinalia''' was held on October 13 in his honor. Throughout the city, fountains and [[Puteal|wellheads]] were adorned with garlands.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Dyson, ''Rome: A Living Portrait of an Ancient City'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010), p. 228. Described by Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 6.3: "The Fontanalia [is named after] Fons, because it's his holiday ''(dies [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae]])''; on account of him then they toss wreaths into fountains and garland [[puteal]]s" (''Fontanalia a Fonte, quod is dies feriae eius; ab eo tum et in fontes coronas iaciunt et puteos coronant''). [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] also mentions the rites ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacra|sacra]])''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fons was the son of [[Juturna]] and [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Nationes'' 3.29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Numa Pompilius]], second [[king of Rome]], was supposed to have been buried near the altar of Fons ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ara|ara]] Fontis)'' on the [[Janiculum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''De legibus'' 2.56 and ''De natura deorum'' 3.52; [[Samuel Ball Platner]], ''The Topography and Monuments of Ancient Rome'' (1904), p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Warde Fowler]] observed that between 259 and 241 BC, cults were founded for Juturna, Fons, and the [[Tempestas|Tempestates]], all having to do with sources of water.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), p. 285, with a speculation that this was a response to the [[Roman navy|naval activity]] of the [[First Punic War]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a god of pure water, Fons can be placed in opposition to [[Liber]] as a god of wine identified with [[Bacchus]].&lt;ref&gt;As when two characters argue over which holds ''[[imperium]]'' in [[Plautus]]'s ''Stichus'', line 696ff.; Thomas Habinek, ''The World of Roman Song'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Brueghel de Oude en Peter Paul Rubens - Het aards paradijs met de zondeval van Adam en Eva.jpg|thumb|380px|Depiction of the [[original sin]] by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]
'''Forbidden fruit''' is a phrase that originates from the [[Book of Genesis]] concerning [[Adam and Eve]] in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Genesis#2:16|Genesis 2:16–17]]. In the narrative, Adam and Eve eat the fruit of [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|knowledge of good and evil]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], which they had been commanded not to do by [[God]].

==Biblical narrative==
{{main|Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Original sin}}
The narrative of the [[Book of Genesis]] places the first man and woman ([[Adam and Eve]]) in a [[Garden of Eden|garden]] where they may eat the fruit of many trees but are forbidden by God to eat from the "tree of knowledge of good and evil".

{{quote|And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.|[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Genesis#2:16|Genesis 2:16–17]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0102.htm#16|title=Genesis Chapter 2|access-date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Genesis 3, a serpent tempts the woman:

{{quote|And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.|[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Genesis#3:4|Genesis 3:4–5]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0103.htm#4|title=Genesis Chapter 3|access-date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Desiring this wisdom, the woman eats the forbidden fruit and gives some to the man who also eats it. They become aware of their "nakedness" and make fig-leaf clothes, and hide themselves when God approaches.  God curses The Serpent, The Woman then The Man, and expels the Man and Woman from the garden and thereby from eternal life.

The word ''fruit'' appears in Hebrew as פֶּ֫רִי (''pərî''&amp;thinsp;). As to which fruit may have been the forbidden fruit of the [[Garden of Eden]], possibilities include apple, grape,  pomegranate,&lt;ref name="straightdope.com"/&gt;  [[Common fig|fig]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Fig: its History, Culture, and Curing'', Gustavus A. Eisen, Washington, Govt. print. off., 1901&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ceratonia siliqua|carob]],&lt;ref name="straightdope.com"/&gt;  [[etrog]] or [[citron]],&lt;ref name="straightdope.com"/&gt;  [[pear]], and [[mushrooms]]. The [[pseudepigraphic]] [[Book of Enoch]] describes the tree of knowledge: "It was like a species of the [[Tamarind]] tree, bearing fruit which resembled [[grape]]s extremely fine; and its fragrance extended to a considerable distance. I exclaimed, How beautiful is this tree, and how delightful is its appearance!" ([[1 Enoch]] 31:4).

An alternative view is that the forbidden fruit is metaphorical, possibly the fruit of the womb, i.e. sex and procreation from the tree of life.  In his ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', Hindu spiritual teacher Paramhansa Yogananda cites an interpretation by his master Swami Sri Yuktiswar that the Garden of Eden refers to man's body, with the fruit in the center being that of the sexual organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crystalclarity.com/yogananda/chap16.php|title=Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 16, Outwitting the Stars (Paramhansa Yogananda)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple===
In [[Western Europe]], the fruit was often depicted as an [[Apple (symbolism)|apple]]. This was possibly because of a misunderstanding of – or a pun on – ''[[wikt:malum|mălum]]'', a native [[Latin]] noun which means evil (from the adjective ''[[wikt:malus|malus]]''), and ''mālum'', another Latin noun, borrowed from Greek μῆλον, which means apple. In the [[Vulgate]], [[Original sin|Genesis 2:17]] describes the tree as ''de ligno autem scientiae boni et mali''&amp;thinsp;: "but of the tree [literally ''wood''&amp;thinsp;] of knowledge of good and evil" (''mali'' here is the [[genitive]] of ''malum'').

The [[larynx]], specifically the [[laryngeal prominence]] that joins the [[thyroid cartilage]], in the [[human]] [[throat]] is noticeably more prominent in [[males]] and was consequently called an [[Adam's apple]], from a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit getting stuck in Adam's throat as he swallowed it.&lt;ref&gt;E. Cobham Brewer (1810–1897). Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. 1898. "Adam's Apple"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grape===
[[Rabbi Meir]] says that the fruit was a grape, made into wine.&lt;ref name="Berachot 40a; Sanhedrin 70a"&gt;Berachot 40a; Sanhedrin 70a.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zohar]] explains similarly that [[Noah]] attempted (but failed) to rectify the sin of Adam by using grape wine for holy purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar Noah 73a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Zohar: The First Ever Unabridged English Translation, with Commentary''; Rabbi Michael Berg, ed., Vol. 2, pp.388-390&lt;/ref&gt; The midrash of Bereishit Rabah states that the fruit was grape,&lt;ref&gt;Bereishit Rabah 15:7&lt;/ref&gt; or squeezed grapes (perhaps alluding to wine).&lt;ref&gt;Bereishit Rabah 19:5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fig===
{{see also|Figs in the Bible}}
The Bible states in the book of Genesis that Adam and Eve had made their own fig leaf clothing: "And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles".&lt;ref name="JPS Tanakh 1917, Genesis 3:7"&gt;http://biblehub.com/jps/genesis/3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Based on that reference, the forbidden fruit may have been the fig.

Rabbi [[Nehemiah Hayyun|Nechemia]], based on the Talmud, supports the idea that the fruit was a [[ficus|fig]], as it was from fig leaves that God made garments for Adam and Eve upon expelling them from the Garden. "By that with which they were made low were they rectified."&lt;ref name="Berachos 40a; Sanhedrin 70a"&gt;Berachos 40a; Sanhedrin 70a&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the fig is a long-standing symbol of female sexuality, it enjoyed a run as a favorite understudy to the apple as the forbidden fruit during the [[Italian Renaissance]]. The most famous depiction of the fig as the forbidden fruit was painted by [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] in his masterpiece fresco on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]].&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127752216 High Art: Were Botticelli's Venus And Mars Stoned? : NPR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pomegranate===
Proponents of the theory that the Garden of Eden was located somewhere in what is now known as the Middle East suggest that the fruit was actually a [[pomegranate]], a plant indigenous from Iran to the Himalayas and cultivated since ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crfg.org/pubs/ff/pomegranate.html|title=POMEGRANATE Fruit Facts|website=www.crfg.org|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association of the pomegranate with knowledge of the underworld as provided in the Ancient Greek legend of Persephone may also have given rise to an association with knowledge of the otherworld, tying-in with knowledge that is forbidden to mortals.

===Wheat===
[[Judah bar Ilai|Rabbi Yehuda]] proposes that the fruit was [[wheat]], because "a baby does not know to call its mother and father until it tastes the taste of grain."&lt;ref name="Berachot 40a; Sanhedrin 70a"/&gt;

In Hebrew, wheat is "khitah", which has been considered to be a [[pun]] on "khet", meaning "sin".&lt;ref name="straightdope.com"&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2682/was-the-forbidden-fruit-in-the-garden-of-eden-an-apple The Straight Dope: Was the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden an apple?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commonly confused with a seed, in the study of [[botany]] a [[wheat berry]] is technically a simple fruit known as a [[caryopsis]], which has the same structure as an apple. Just as an apple is a fleshy fruit that contains seeds, a grain is a dry fruit that absorbs water and contains a seed. The confusion comes from the fact that the fruit of a grass happens to have a form similar to some seeds.&lt;ref name="Mauseth2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=James D. Mauseth|title=Botany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BGEs95p5EsC&amp;pg=PA223|year=2014|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-4884-8|page=223|quote=Perhaps the simplest of fruits are those of grasses (all cereals such as corn and wheat)...These fruits are caryopses.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mushroom===
A fresco in the 13th-century [[Plaincourault Abbey]] in France depicts Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, flanking a Tree of Knowledge that has the appearance of a gigantic ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', a psychoactive mushroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Use of Fungi as Food and in Food Processing, Part 2 |author=William Dudley Gray |publisher=CRC Press |year=1973 |page=182 |isbn=0-8493-0118-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Terence McKenna]] proposed that the forbidden fruit was a reference to [[psychotropic]] plants and [[fungi]], specifically [[psilocybin mushrooms]], which played a central role, he theorized, in the [[evolution]] of the human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfTYa_suhDk|title=Food Of The Gods (Terence McKenna) [FULL]|date=24 July 2011|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in a well-documented and heavily criticized study,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/23/obituaries/john-allegro-65-aided-deciphering-of-dead-sea-scrolls.html "John Allegro, 65; Aided Deciphering of Dead Sea Scrolls"], obit., NY Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''John Marco Allegro: The Maverick of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', by Judith Anne Brown, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (1 March 2005), {{ISBN|978-0-8028-6333-1}}, pp. xii-xiii&lt;/ref&gt; [[John M. Allegro]] proposed the mushroom as the forbidden fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=1970|title=The Sacred Mushroom and The Cross: A study of the nature and origins of Christianity within the fertility cults of the ancient Near East|author=Allegro, John M.|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, New York}}, re-released in a new edition by Gnostic Media Research &amp; Publishing in 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic tradition===
{{see also|Adam and Eve#Islamic tradition|Original sin#Islamic view}}

According to the {{transl|ar|DIN|Quran}}, Surah [[Al-A'raf]] 7:19 describes [[Adam#Islamic view|{{transl|ar|DIN|Adam}}]] and his wife in [[Jannah|Paradise]] where they may eat what is provided, except that they may not eat from one particular [[Tree of life (Quran)|tree]], should they be considered ''[[Zalimun]]'' (wrongdoers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|19|s=ns}}; "And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both wish, but approach not this tree otherwise you both will be of the Zâlimûn (unjust and wrong-doers)."&lt;/ref&gt; Surah [[Ibrahim (sura)|Ibrahim]] 14:26 describes the forbidden tree as an evil tree that is forbidden for guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|14|26|s=ns}}: "And the simlitude/parable  (مۡثَالَ )of an evil word is that of an evil tree uprooted from the surface of earth having no stability."&lt;/ref&gt;

Surah Al-A'raf 7:22 describes the [[Iblis|{{transl|ar|DIN|ˈibliːs}}]] (Satan) who misled them with deception, and then it was {{transl|ar|DIN|Adam}} who initiated eating from the forbidden tree. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame became manifest to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise. And their Lord called out to them: "Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you; Verily, Shaitân is an open enemy unto you?" ({{Cite quran|7|19|s=ns}}). The {{transl|ar|DIN|Quran}} holds both Adam and his wife accountable for eating the forbidden fruit. As punishment, they were forced to leave the garden, banished from [[Jannah#Descriptions of Paradise|Heaven]] and sent to the Earth where they were forgiven after repenting.

The '''Fushun process''' is an above-ground retorting technology for [[shale oil extraction]]. It is named after the main production site of [[Fushun]], [[Liaoning]] province in northeastern [[China]].

==History==
The Fushun process was developed and utilized for the extraction of [[shale oil]] in China during the mid-1920s.&lt;ref name=qian/&gt;  The commercial-scale utilization of the process began in 1930 with the construction of "Refinery No. 1".&lt;ref name=id&gt;{{cite paper|title=Shale oil: Perspective with China focus |publisher=Intelligence Dynamics |url=http://www.accelenergy.com/downloads/Shale_Oil_in_China.pdf |format=PDF |date=2007-03-07 |accessdate=2009-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075722/http://www.accelenergy.com/downloads/Shale_Oil_in_China.pdf |archivedate=July 7, 2011 }}

&lt;/ref&gt;   After World War II, the shale oil production was ceased, but 100&amp;nbsp;Fushun-type oil shale retorts were restored in 1949.&lt;ref name=qian2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, total 266&amp;nbsp;retorts were in operation, each with the capacity of 100–200&amp;nbsp;tons of shale oil per day.&lt;ref name="id"/&gt;

With the discovery of [[Daqing Field|Daqing oil field]] in the 1960s, the shale oil production declined and  [[Sinopec]], an operator of shale oil production these times, shut down its oil shale operations in the beginning of the 1990s.&lt;ref name=qian2/&gt;  At the same time, the Fushun Oil Shale Retorting Plant, using Fushun process technology, was established as a part of the [[Fushun Mining Group]]. It started production in 1992.&lt;ref name=dyni/&gt;  In 2005, China became the largest [[shale oil]] producer in the world.&lt;ref name="id" /&gt;

In 1985-1986, [[Sinopec]] used the Fushun process for a test processing of [[oil shale in Jordan|Jordan's oil shale]] from the El Lajjun deposit. Although the process was technically viable, the cooperation was halted due to high operation costs.&lt;ref name=jordan2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It uses a vertical cylindrical type shaft retort, with outside steel plate lined with inner fire bricks. The retort has height over {{convert|10|m|ft}} and its inner diameter is about {{convert|3|m|ft}}. Raw oil shale particles with the size of {{convert|10|to|75|mm|in|1}} are fed from the top of the retort. At the upper section of the retort oil shale is dried and heated by the ascending hot gases, which pass upward through the descending oil shale causing decomposition of the rock. The pyrolysis takes place at about {{convert|500|°C|°F|-1}}.&lt;ref name=qian/&gt;  The produced oil vapor and gases exit from the top of the retort; hot gases and oil vapors move from the bottom to the top directly, and not diagonally like in [[Kiviter process]].&lt;ref name=fushun/&gt;  During the pyrolysis process, oil shale is decomposed to shale coke ([[char]]), which together with the ascending air-steam is burnt in the lower part of the retort to heat gases necessary for pyrolysis. These gases are recirculated; after leaving retort, they are cooled in a condensation system, where shale oil is condensed, and re-heated in a heating furnace about {{convert|500|°C|°F|-1}} to {{convert|700|°C|°F|-1}} before reinserting into the retort. The shale ash exits from a rotating water dish that acts as a seal and cooler at the bottom of the retort.&lt;ref name=qian/&gt;

Retorts are operated in sets and have a heat carrier preparation unit and rotating water seals designed for the whole set instead of a single retort as in case of the [[Kiviter process|Kiviter retort]].  Regenerative furnaces are located next to the retorts and they are operating in two cycles – the combustion cycle and the gas heating cycle. During the combustion cycle, a furnace is heated up to {{convert|1000|°C|°F|-1}} by combustion gases.  After the combustion cycle, retort gases from the condensation system is inserted into a furnace for their heating.&lt;ref name=fushun/&gt;  By alternating furnaces, one furnace is always available for heating retort gas.  Twenty retorts typically share one condensation system and a set of heating furnaces.&lt;ref name=qian/&gt;

Advantages of the Fushun process include small investment and stable operation.&lt;ref name=chemical&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The process is characterized by the high thermal efficiency, but due to the addition of air into the retort, the [[nitrogen]] dilutes the pyrolysis gas. In addition, the excess [[oxygen]] in retort burns out a part of  produced shale oil, which reduce the shale oil yield. The oil yield of the Fushun retort accounts for about 65% of [[Fischer Assay]].&lt;ref name=qian/&gt; Disadvantage of this process is a high water consumption amounting to 6–7&amp;nbsp;barrels of water per barrel of produced shale-oil, and great quantities of waste shale.  It is not suitable of ores with small size and oil content lower than 5%.&lt;ref name=chemical/&gt;

As the capacity of single retort is limited, Fushun process is suitable for small-scale retorting plants, and for processing lean oil shale with low gas yield.&lt;ref name=qian&gt;{{Cite conference

A '''geostationary orbit''', often referred to as a '''geosynchronous equatorial orbit'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ariane 5 User's Manual Issue 5 Revision 1 |url=http://www.arianespace.com/launch-services-ariane5/Ariane5_users_manual_Issue5_July2011.pdf |work=arianespace |accessdate=28 July 2013 |date=July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215844/http://www.arianespace.com/launch-services-ariane5/Ariane5_users_manual_Issue5_July2011.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''GEO'''), is a [[circular orbit|circular]] [[geosynchronous orbit]] {{convert|35786|km|mi|abbr=on}} above [[Earth]]'s [[equator]] and following the [[retrograde and prograde motion|direction]] of [[Earth's rotation]]. An object in such an orbit appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers. [[Communications satellite]]s and [[weather satellite]]s are often placed in geostationary orbits, so that the [[satellite dish|satellite antennae]] (located on Earth) that communicate with them do not have to rotate to track them, but can be pointed permanently at the position in the sky where the satellites are located. Using this characteristic, [[Ocean color|ocean-color]] monitoring satellites with visible and near-[[infrared]] [[photodetector|light sensors]] (e.g. [[Geostationary Ocean Color Imager|GOCI]]) can also be operated in geostationary orbit in order to monitor sensitive changes of ocean environments.

A geostationary orbit is a particular type of geosynchronous orbit, which has an [[orbital period]] equal to Earth's rotational period, or one [[sidereal day]] (23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds). Thus, the distinction is that, while an object in geosynchronous orbit returns to the same point in the sky at the same time each day, an object in geostationary orbit never leaves that position. Geosynchronous orbits move around relative to a point on Earth's surface because, while geostationary orbits have an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 0° with respect to the [[Equator]], geosynchronous orbits have varying inclinations and [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricities]].

== History ==
The first appearance of a geostationary [[orbit]] in popular literature was in the first [[Venus Equilateral]] story by [[George O. Smith]],&lt;ref name="VE"&gt;"(Korvus's message is sent) to a small, squat building at the outskirts of Northern Landing. It was hurled at the sky. … It … arrived at the relay station tired and worn, … when it reached a space station only five hundred miles above the city of North Landing." {{cite book|last=Smith|first=George O.|title=The Complete Venus Equilateral|date=1976|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-345-28953-7|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Smith did not go into details. British [[science fiction author]] [[Arthur C. Clarke]] disseminated the idea widely, with more details on how it would work, in a 1945 paper entitled "''Extra-Terrestrial Relays — Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?''", published in ''[[Wireless World]]'' magazine. Clarke acknowledged the connection in his introduction to ''The Complete Venus Equilateral''.&lt;ref name="VEintro"&gt;"It is therefore quite possible that these stories influenced me subconsciously when … I worked out the principles of synchronous communications satellistes …", op. cit, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; The orbit, which Clarke first described as useful for broadcast and relay communications satellites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Arthur C. Clarke | url = http://www.clarkefoundation.org/docs/ClarkeWirelessWorldArticle.pdf | title = Extra-Terrestrial Relays — Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage? | date = October 1945 | accessdate = 4 March 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090318000548/http://www.clarkefoundation.org/docs/ClarkeWirelessWorldArticle.pdf| archivedate= 18 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes called the Clarke Orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[NASA]] | url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf5-1.php | title = Basics of Space Flight Section 1 Part 5, Geostationary Orbits | accessdate = 21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Clarke Belt is the part of space about {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} above [[mean sea level|sea level]], in the plane of the equator, where near-geostationary orbits may be implemented. The Clarke Orbit is about {{convert|265000|km|mi|-3|abbr=on}} in circumference.

== Practical uses ==
{{See also| Geosynchronous satellite}}

Most commercial [[communications satellite]]s, [[broadcast satellite]]s and [[SBAS]] satellites operate in geostationary orbits. A [[geosynchronous transfer orbit|geostationary transfer orbit]] is used to move a satellite from [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) into a geostationary orbit. The first satellite placed into a geostationary orbit was the [[Syncom]]-3, launched by a [[Delta (rocket family)#Delta D|Delta D rocket]] in 1964.

A worldwide network of operational geostationary meteorological satellites is used to provide visible and infrared images of Earth's surface and atmosphere. These satellite systems include:
* the United States [[GOES]]
* [[Meteosat]], launched by the [[European Space Agency]] and operated by the European Weather Satellite Organization, [[EUMETSAT]]
* the [[Japan]]ese [[Himawari (satellite)|Himawari]]
* Chinese [[Fengyun]]
* [[India]]'s [[INSAT]] series

A [[statite]], a hypothetical satellite that uses a [[solar sail]] to modify its orbit, could theoretically hold itself in a geostationary "orbit" with different altitude and/or inclination from the "traditional" equatorial geostationary orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country = US |number = 5183225 |status = patent |title = STATITE: SPACECRAFT THAT UTILIZES SIGHT PRESSURE AND METHOD OF USE |pubdate = 1993-02-02 |pridate = 1989-01-09 |inventor-surname = Forward |inventor-given = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communications ===
Satellites in geostationary orbits are far enough away from Earth that communication [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] becomes significant — about a quarter of a second for a trip from one ground-based transmitter to the satellite and back to another ground-based transmitter; close to half a second for a round-trip communication from one Earth station to another and then back to the first.

For example, for ground stations at [[latitudes]] of ''φ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±45° on the same [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] as the satellite, the time taken for a signal to pass from Earth to the satellite and back again can be computed using the [[Law of cosines|cosine rule]], given the geostationary orbital radius ''r'' (derived below), the [[Earth's radius]] ''R'' and the [[speed of light]] ''c'', as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = \frac{2}{c} \sqrt{R^2 + r^2 - 2 R r \cos\varphi} \approx 253~\text{ms}.&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that ''r'' is the orbital radius, the distance from the centre of the Earth, not the height above the equator.)

This delay presents problems for latency-sensitive applications such as voice communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isoc.org/inet96/proceedings/g1/g1_3.htm The Teledesic Network: Using Low-Earth-Orbit Satellites to Provide Broadband, Wireless, Real-Time Internet Access Worldwide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Geostationary satellites are directly overhead at the equator and appear lower in the sky to an observer nearer the poles. As the observer's latitude increases, communication becomes more difficult due to factors such as atmospheric refraction, Earth's thermal emission, line-of-sight obstructions, and signal reflections from the ground or nearby structures. At latitudes above about 81°, geostationary satellites are below the horizon and cannot be seen at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/Articles/SolerEisemannJSE.pdf p. 123].&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, some [[Russia]]n communication satellites have used [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] [[Molniya orbit|Molniya]] and [[Tundra orbit|Tundra]] orbits, which have excellent visibility at high latitudes.

=== Orbit allocation ===
Satellites in geostationary orbit must all occupy a single ring above the [[equator]]. The requirement to space these satellites apart to avoid harmful radio-frequency interference during operations means that there are a limited number of orbital "slots" available, and thus only a limited number of satellites can be operated in geostationary orbit. This has led to conflict between different countries wishing access to the same orbital slots (countries near the same [[longitude]] but differing [[latitudes]]) and radio frequencies. These disputes are addressed through the [[International Telecommunication Union]]'s allocation mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/conferences/seminars/mexico-2001/docs/06-procedure-mechanism.doc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327092830/http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/conferences/seminars/mexico-2001/docs/06-procedure-mechanism.doc|date=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/go/space/en ITU Space Services Division].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1976 Bogotá Declaration, eight countries located on the Earth's equator claimed sovereignty over the geostationary orbits above their territory, but the claims gained no international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Oduntan, Gbenga. {{cite web | url =http://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/38629/HLJ_V1I2_Oduntan.pdf | title = The Never Ending Dispute: Legal Theories on the Spatial Demarcation Boundary Plane between Airspace and Outer Space}} Hertfordshire Law Journal, 1(2), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orbital stability ==
A geostationary orbit can be achieved only at an altitude very close to {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and directly above the equator. This equates to an orbital velocity of {{convert|3.07|km/s|mi/s|2| abbr=on}} and an orbital period of 1,436 minutes, which equates to almost exactly one [[sidereal day]] (23.934461223 hours). This ensures that the satellite will match the Earth's rotational period and has a stationary [[Footprint (satellite)|footprint]] on the ground. All geostationary satellites have to be located on this ring.

A combination of [[Moon|lunar]] gravity, [[Sun|solar]] gravity, and the flattening of the Earth at its poles causes a [[precession]] motion of the orbital plane of any geostationary object, with an [[orbital period]] of about 53 years and an initial inclination gradient of about 0.85° per year, achieving a maximal inclination of 15° after 26.5 years.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015&gt;[http://hanspeterschaub.info/Papers/Anderson2015c.pdf OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS OF GEO DEBRIS SYNCHRONIZATION DYNAMICS. Anderson]&lt;/ref&gt; To correct for this [[perturbation (astronomy)|orbital perturbation]], regular [[orbital stationkeeping]] manoeuvres are necessary, amounting to a [[delta-v]] of approximately 50&amp;nbsp;m/s per year.

A second effect to be taken into account is the longitudinal drift, caused by the asymmetry of the Earth – the equator is slightly elliptical. There are two stable (at 75.3°E and 252°E) and two unstable (at 165.3°E and 14.7°W) equilibrium points. Any geostationary object placed between the equilibrium points would (without any action) be slowly accelerated towards the stable equilibrium position, causing a periodic longitude variation.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015/&gt; The correction of this effect requires [[Orbital station-keeping#Station-keeping in geostationary orbit|station-keeping maneuvers]] with a maximal delta-v of about 2&amp;nbsp;m/s per year, depending on the desired longitude.

[[Solar wind]] and [[radiation pressure]] also exert small forces on satellites; over time, these cause them to slowly drift away from their prescribed orbits.

In the absence of servicing missions from the Earth or a renewable propulsion method, the consumption of thruster propellant for station keeping places a limitation on the lifetime of the satellite. [[Hall-effect thruster]]s, which are currently in use, have the potential to prolong the service life of a satellite by providing high-efficiency [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]].

=== Limitations to usable life of geostationary satellites ===
When they run out of thruster fuel, the satellites are at the end of their service life, as they are no longer able to stay in their allocated orbital position. The transponders and other onboard systems generally outlive the thruster fuel and, by stopping N–S station keeping, some satellites can continue to be used in [[inclined orbit]]s (where the orbital track appears to follow a [[analemma#Analemmas of geosynchronous satellites|figure-eight loop centred on the equator]]),&lt;ref&gt;Shi Hu-Li, Han Yan-Ben, Ma Li-Hua, Pei Jun, Yin Zhi-Qiang and Ji Hai-Fu (2010). Beyond Life-Cycle Utilization of Geostationary Communication Satellites in End-of-Life, Satellite Communications, Nazzareno Diodato (Ed.), {{ISBN|978-953-307-135-0}}, InTech, {{cite web | url = http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/multi-life-cycles-utilization-of-retired-satellites | title = Beyond Life-Cycle Utilization of Geostationary Communication Satellites in End-of-Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.satsig.net/satellite/inclined-orbit-operation.htm | title = Inclined orbit operation}}&lt;/ref&gt; or else be elevated to a "graveyard" [[Graveyard orbit|disposal orbit]].

== Derivation of geostationary altitude ==
[[Image:Comparison satellite navigation orbits.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Comparison of geostationary Earth orbit with [[GPS]], [[GLONASS]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] and [[Compass navigation system|Compass (medium Earth orbit)]] [[satellite navigation system]] orbits with the [[International Space Station]], [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and [[Iridium constellation]] orbits, and the nominal size of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Orbital periods and speeds are calculated using the relations 4&amp;pi;&amp;sup2;''R''&amp;sup3;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T''&amp;sup2;''GM'' and ''V''&amp;sup2;''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''GM'', where ''R'' = radius of orbit in metres, ''T'' = orbital period in seconds, ''V'' = orbital speed in m/s, ''G'' = gravitational constant &amp;asymp; 6.673{{e|-11}}&amp;nbsp;Nm&amp;sup2;/kg&amp;sup2;, ''M'' = mass of Earth &amp;asymp; 5.98{{e|24}}&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moon]]'s orbit is around 9 times larger (in radius and length) than geostationary orbit.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Approximately 8.6 times when the moon is nearest (363&amp;thinsp;104 km ÷ 42&amp;thinsp;164 km) to 9.6 times when the moon is farthest (405,696 km ÷ 42,164 km).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In any circular orbit, the [[centripetal force]] required to maintain the orbit (F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) is provided by the gravitational force on the satellite (F&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;). To calculate the geostationary orbit altitude, one begins with this equivalence:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\text{c} = \mathbf{F}_\text{g}.&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Newton's second law]] of motion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Newton's Second Law |url=http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/u2l3a.cfm |website=The Physics Classroom}}&lt;/ref&gt; we can replace the forces F with the [[mass]] ''m'' of the object multiplied by the [[acceleration]] felt by the object due to that force:

: &lt;math&gt;m \mathbf{a}_\text{c} = m \mathbf{g}.&lt;/math&gt;

We note that the mass of the satellite ''m'' appears on both sides — geostationary orbit is independent of the mass of the satellite.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In the [[Geocentric gravitational constant#Small body orbiting a central body|small-body approximation]], the geostationary orbit is independent of the satellite's mass. For satellites having a mass less than ''M''&amp;nbsp;''μ&lt;sub&gt;err&lt;/sub&gt;''/''μ'' ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg, that is, over a billion times that of the [[ISS]], the error due to the approximation is smaller than the error on the universal [[geocentric gravitational constant]] (and thus negligible).&lt;/ref&gt; Calculating the geostationary altitude, therefore, simplifies down to calculating the altitude where the magnitudes of the [[centripetal acceleration]] required for orbital motion and the [[gravitational acceleration]] provided by Earth's gravity are equal.

The centripetal acceleration's magnitude is:

: &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{a}_\text{c}| = \omega^2 r,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω'' is the [[angular speed]], and ''r'' is the orbital radius as measured from the Earth's center of mass.

The magnitude of the gravitational acceleration is:

: &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{g}| = \frac{G M}{r^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the mass of Earth, {{nowrap|5.9736 × 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg}}, and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]],
{{nowrap|(6.67428 ± 0.00067) × 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Equating the two accelerations gives:

: &lt;math&gt;r^3 = \frac{G M}{\omega^2} \to r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{G M}{\omega^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The product ''GM'' is known with much greater precision than either factor alone; it is known as the [[geocentric gravitational constant]] ''μ'' = {{nowrap|398,600.4418 ± 0.0008 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Hence

: &lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt[3]{\frac\mu{\omega^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The angular speed ''ω'' is found by dividing the angle travelled in one revolution (360° = 2π [[radian|rad]]) by the orbital period (the time it takes to make one full revolution). In the case of a geostationary orbit, the orbital period is one [[sidereal day]], or {{val|86164.09054|u=seconds}}).&lt;ref&gt;Edited by P. Kenneth Seidelmann, "Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac", University Science Books,1992, p. 700.&lt;/ref&gt; This gives

: &lt;math&gt;\omega \approx \frac{2\pi~\text{rad}} {86\,164~\text{s}} \approx 7.2921 \times 10^{-5}~\text{rad/s}.&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting orbital radius is {{convert|42164|km|mi}}. Subtracting the [[Earth radius|Earth's equatorial radius]], {{convert|6378|km|mi}}, gives the altitude of {{convert|35786|km|mi}}.

Orbital speed is calculated by multiplying the angular speed by the orbital radius:

: &lt;math&gt;v = \omega r \approx 3.0746~\text{km/s} \approx 11\,068~\text{km/h} \approx 6877.8~\text{mph}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the same formula, we can find the geostationary-type orbit of an object in relation to [[Mars]] (this type of orbit above is referred to as an [[areostationary orbit]] if it is above Mars). The [[geocentric gravitational constant]] ''GM'' (which is ''μ'') for Mars has the value of 42,828&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the known [[rotational period]] (''T'') of Mars is 88,642.66 seconds. Since ''ω'' = 2{{pi}}/''T'', using the formula above, the value of ''ω'' is found to be approx 7.088218×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus ''r''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8.5243×10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, whose cube root is 20,427&amp;nbsp;km (the orbital radius); subtracting the equatorial radius of Mars (3396.2&amp;nbsp;km) gives the orbital altitude of 17,031&amp;nbsp;km.

Orbital speed of a Mars geostationary orbit can be calculated as for Earth above:

&lt;math&gt;v = \omega r \approx 1.4479~\text{km/s} \approx 5\,212~\text{km/h}.&lt;/math&gt;

Richard Moss, ''New Atlas''. 14 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A full-waveform [[Lidar]] will be attached to the [[International Space Station]] to provide the first global, high-resolution observations of forest vertical structure. This will allow scientists to map [[habitat]]s and [[biomass]], particularly in the tropics, providing detail on the Earth's [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref name='B Insider 2015'&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/nasa-gedi-will-image-the-worlds-forests-in-3d-2015-3?r=US&amp;IR=T NASA has a plan to take the most detailed scans of the world's forests ever]. Pierre Bienaimé, ''Business Insider - UK''. 3 March 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;

The Principal Investigator is Ralph Dubayah, at the [[University of Maryland]].

==Overview==
GEDI was competitively selected as a NASA Earth Ventures Instrument (EVI) mission in 2014. Cost-capped at $94 M, GEDI is led by the [[University of Maryland]] in collaboration with NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref name='GEDI Goddard'&gt;[https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13090 GEDI Media Resources]. NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. October 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Climate change]] is closely tied to that of the carbon cycle.&lt;ref name='B Insider 2015'/&gt; GEDI produces high resolution laser ranging observations of the 3D structure of the forests Earth, which will provide answers to how deforestation has contributed to atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations, how much carbon forests will absorb in the future, and how [[habitat degradation]] will affect global [[biodiversity]] and the [[water cycle]].&lt;ref name='GEDI home'/&gt; This in turn, is also of value for [[weather forecasting]], [[forest management]], [[glacier]] and snowpack monitoring.&lt;ref name='GEDI home'/&gt; Overall, GEDI will help to better understand how the Earth behaves as a living system.

It is due for launch on 2 December 2018 on a [[Falcon 9]] and it is part of the [[SpaceX CRS-16]] mission. It will be mounted on the Exposed Facility of the Japanese [[Kibo (ISS module)|''Kibo'']] module for a two-year mission.&lt;ref name='GEDI home'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/gedi.htm |title=GEDI |work=Gunter's Space Page |first=Gunter |last=Krebs |access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission is being led by Professor Ralph Dubayah of the University of Maryland.

==Instrument==

The GEDI instrument is a geodetic-class, light detection and ranging ([[Lidar]]) laser system comprised of 3 lasers that produce 8 parallel tracks of observations. Each laser fires 242 times per second and illuminates a 25 m spot (a footprint) on the surface over which 3D structure is measured. Each footprint is separated by 60 m along track, with an across-track distance of about 600 m between each of the 8 tracks. GEDI is expected to produce about 10 billion cloud-free observations during its nominal 24-month mission length.&lt;ref name='GEDI home'/&gt;&gt;&lt;ref name='New Atlas 2014'/&gt;&lt;ref name='GEDI Goddard'/&gt;

'''Helium production in the United States''' totaled 73 million cubic meters in 2014. The US was the world's largest helium producer, providing 40 percent of world supply. In addition, the US federal government sold 30 million cubic meters from storage. Other major helium producers were Algeria and Qatar. 

All commercial helium is recovered from natural gas. Helium usually makes up a minuscule portion of natural gas, but can make up as much as 10 percent of natural gas in some fields. A helium content of 0.3 percent or more is considered necessary for commercial helium extraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/articles/helium/ Helium], Geology.Com.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, helium was recovered at 16 extraction plants, from gas wells in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming. One extraction plant in Utah was idle in 2012.

==History==
[[File:US Helium Production and Storage 1940-2014.png|thumb|Helium production and storage in the United States, 1940-2014 (data from USGS)]]
In 1903, an oil exploration well at [[Dexter, Kansas]], produced a gas that would not burn. Kansas state geologist [[Erasmus Haworth]] took samples of the gas back to the [[University of Kansas]] at Lawrence where chemists [[Hamilton Cady]] and David McFarland discovered that gas contained 1.84 percent helium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = McFarland, D. F. |title = Composition of Gas from a Well at Dexter, Kan |volume = 19|pages = 60–62 |date = 1903 |journal = Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science |doi = 10.2307/3624173|jstor = 3624173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Discovery of Helium in Natural Gas at the University of Kansas | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/heliumnaturalgas.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Cady, H.P. |last2=McFarland|first2=D.

The military was interested in helium for balloons and dirigibles. The US Army built the first helium extraction plant in 1915 at Petrolia, Texas, where a large natural gas field averaged nearly 1 percent helium.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/dop04 Petrolia oilfield], Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Navy]] established three experimental helium plants during World War I, to recover enough helium to supply [[barrage balloon]]s with the non-flammable, lighter-than-air gas. Two of the experimental plants were north of Fort Worth, Texas, and recovered helium from natural gas piped in from the Petrolia oil field in Clay County, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Alsobrook, [http://www.thc.state.tx.us/blog/taking-preservation-lightly-historic-helium-plants-texas Taking preservation lightly], Texas Historical Commission, 22 Aug. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mineral Leasing Act of 1920|Mineral Leasing Act]], which provided for oil and gas leasing on federal land, reserved all helium contained in natural gas on federal land to the government.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

During World War II, military demand for helium rose, so the federal government built a number of new helium extraction plants. One such plant was at Shiprock, New Mexico, to recover helium from gas at the Rattlesnake Field. Gas from the Rattlesnake field, like that of a number of other fields in the Four Corners area, contained mostly [[nitrogen]] and very little [[hydrocarbons]], and was produced exclusively for the helium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2011/ph240/tilghman1/docs/nmg_v27_n4_p93.pdf "Helium in New Mexico,"] ''New Mexico Geology'', v.27 n.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Helium Acts Amendments of 1960 (Public Law 86–777) empowered the [[United States Bureau of Mines|U.S. Bureau of Mines]] to arrange for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas. The Bureau also built a {{convert|425|mi|km|adj=on}} pipeline from [[Bushton, Kansas]], to connect those plants with the government's partially depleted Cliffside gas field, near Amarillo, Texas. The crude helium (50 percent to 80 percent helium) was injected and stored in the Cliffside gas field until needed, when it then was further purified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Federal Register|date = 2005-10-06|volume = 70|issue = 193|page = 58464|url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2005/pdf/05-20084.pdf|format=PDF| title = Conservation Helium Sale|accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1995, a billion cubic meters of the gas had been stored, but the reserve was US$1.4&amp;nbsp;billion in debt, prompting the [[Congress of the United States]] in 1996 to phase out the reserve.&lt;ref name="stwertka"&gt;Stwertka, Albert (1998). ''Guide to the Elements: Revised Edition''. New York; Oxford University Press, p. 24. {{ISBN|0-19-512708-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting "Helium Privatization Act of 1996"&lt;ref&gt;Helium Privatization Act of 1996 {{USPL|104|273}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Public Law 104–273) directed the [[United States Department of the Interior]] to empty the reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309070384|title = Executive Summary |publisher = nap.edu |accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales to government and government contractor began in 1998. Sales to the open market began in 2003. The sales program paid the indebtedness, and is still selling helium.

==Geology==
All commercial production of helium comes from natural gas. There are two basic types of commercial helium deposits: natural gas produced primarily for the hydrocarbon content, typically containing less than 3 percent helium; and gas with little or no hydrocarbons, produced solely for the helium, which typically makes up between 5 and 10 percent of the gas. Although natural gas in which helium is only a byproduct contains a much lower percentage of helium, historically it has supplied the most helium.

Most geologists believe that the majority of helium in natural gas derives from radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, either from radioactive black shales, or granitoid basement rock. Granite and related rocks tend to contain more uranium and thorium than other rock types. However, some believe that the helium is largely primordial.

Unusual geological conditions are considered necessary for commercial concentrations of helium in natural gas. Helium accumulations are commonly in structural closures overlying bedrock highs. Faults, fractures, and igneous intrusives are regarded by some geologists as important pathways for helium to migrate upward into the sedimentary section. The atomic radius of helium is so small that shale, which is effective in trapping methane, allows the helium to migrate upward through the shale pores. Nonporous caprock such as halite (rock salt) or anhydrite is more effective in trapping helium. Helium deposits occur mostly in Paleozoic rocks. 

High helium content of natural gas is accompanied by high contents of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The percentage of nitrogen is usually 10 to 20 times that of helium, so that natural gas with 5 percent or more helium may have little or no methane. A representative sample from the Pinta Dome in [[Apache County, Arizona]], for instance, has 8.3 percent helium, 89.9 percent nitrogen, 1 percent carbon dioxide, and only 0.1 percent methane. In such cases, the gas is produced solely for its helium content.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S. Turner, "Natural gas in Black Mesa Basin, northeastern Arizona," in ''Natural Gases of North America'', v.2, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Memoir 9, p.1357-1370.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the highest production and largest known reserves of helium were in the gases produced for their hydrocarbon content. The most important of these were the Hugoton, Panhandle, Greenwood, and Keyes fields, all located in western Kansas, and the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas. The Hugoton and Panhandle fields are particularly large, covering thousands of square miles. The helium content of the gas varies greatly within some fields. In the Panhandle field, helium content is highest, up to 1.3 percent or more, along the updip southwest edge, and lowest, 0.1 percent along the northeast edge.&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Pierce and others, "Uranium and helium in the Panhandle gas field, Texas, and adjacent areas," US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 454-G, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 2003, the natural gas fields of the Great Plains of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, still held important reserves, but out of 100 BCF of total measured helium reserves in the US, 61 BCF was contained in the Riley Ridge field of western Wyoming, a gas deposit produced for its carbon dioxide content.&lt;ref&gt;B.D. Gage and D.L. Driskill, [http://www.blm.gov/nstc/library/pdf/HeliumResourcesTN415.pdf Helium Resources of the United States – 2003], US Bureau of Land Management, Technical Note 415, June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Four Corners area of the southwest US has a number of gas fields containing 5 to 10 percent helium and large percentages of nitrogen, with little or no hydrocarbons. The fields are associated with igneous intrusions. One field, Dineh-bi-Keyah in Arizona, produced oil from a fractured sill. The other fields have no associated oil.

==Processing==
[[File:Crude Helium Enrichment Unit.jpg|thumb|The Crude Helium Enrichment Unit in the Cliffside Gas Field.]]
Helium is marketed in two specifications: crude helium, which typically contains 75 percent to 80 percent helium, and Grade A helium, which is 99.995 percent pure.

==Storage==
A large volume of helium was stored underground in the Cliffside field in the decade following the Helium Act Amendments of 1960. In recent years, the reserve has been systematically selling its helium. As of 2012 the [[National Helium Reserve|United States National Helium Reserve]] still accounted for 30 percent of the world's helium.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite news|author=@tdnewcomb |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/08/23/theres-a-helium-shortage-on-and-its-affecting-more-than-just-balloons/?xid=newsletter-weekly#the-government |title=There's a Helium Shortage On — and It's Affecting More than Just Balloons Time August 21, 2012 |publisher=Newsfeed.time.com |date=2012-08-21 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reserve was expected to run out of helium in 2018.&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt;

==Trade==
The United States is a major exporter of Helium.

For many years the United States produced more than 90% of the commercial helium in the world. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in [[Arzew]], Algeria, began producing 17&amp;nbsp;million cubic meters (600&amp;nbsp;million cubic feet), enough to supply all of Europe's demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/ds/2005/140/helium-use.pdf|format=PDF| title= Helium End User Statistic|accessdate=2008-07-20|publisher = U.S. Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004–2006, two additional plants, one in [[Ras Laffan Industrial City|Ras Laffan]], [[Qatar]], and the other in [[Skikda]], Algeria, were built, and Algeria became the second leading producer of helium.&lt;ref name="wwsupply"&gt;{{Cite journal

In August 2014, the Bureau of Land Management auctioned crude helium from the national reserve at an average price of $104 per MCF of helium content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/info/news_releases0/2015/august/fy16_helium_sale_and0.html FY2016 helium auction yields 28.54 million], US Bureau of Land Management, 27 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Grade A helium sold for about US$200 per MCF, or $7.21 per cubic meter in 2014.

'''Hickory''' is a type of [[tree]], comprising the [[genus]] '''''Carya''''' ({{lang-grc|κάρυον}}, ''káryon'', meaning "[[Nut (fruit)|nut]]"). The genus includes 17 to 19 species. Five or six species are native to [[China]], [[Indochina]], and [[India]] ([[Assam]]), as many as 12 are native to the United States, four are found in [[Mexico]], and two to four are from [[Canada]]. A number of hickory species are used by man for products like edible nuts ([[pecan]]s) or wood. 

Hickories are [[deciduous]] trees with [[Pinnate|pinnately compound]] [[leaf|leaves]] and large [[nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Hickory [[flower]]s are small, yellow-green [[catkin]]s produced in spring. They are [[anemophily|wind-pollinated]] and [[Self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]]. The [[fruit]] is a globose or oval nut, {{convert|2|–|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|–|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} diameter, enclosed in a four-valved [[husk]], which splits open at maturity. The nut shell is thick and bony in most species, and thin in a few, notably the pecan (''C. illinoinensis''); it is divided into two halves, which split apart when the seed [[germination|germinates]].

Beaked hickory (''Annamocarya sinensis'') is a species formerly classified as ''Carya sinensis'', but now adjudged in the monotypic genus ''[[Annamocarya]]''.

== Species and classification ==

==Ecology==

Hickory is used as a food plant by the [[Caterpillar|larvae]] of some [[Lepidoptera]] species. These include:
* Luna moth (''[[Actias luna]]'')
* [[Brown-tail]] (''Euproctis chrysorrhoea'')
* ''[[Coleophora]]'' case-bearers, ''C. laticornella'' and ''C. ostryae''
* [[Regal moth]]s (''Citheronia regalis''), whose caterpillars are known as hickory horn-devils
* [[Walnut sphinx]] (''Amorpha juglandis'')
* The bride ([[nominate subspecies]] ''[[Catocala neogama]] neogama'')
* [[Hickory tussock moth]] (''Lophocampa caryae'')

The hickory leaf stem gall phylloxera (''[[Phylloxera]] caryaecaulis'') also uses the hickory tree as a food source. Phylloxeridae are related to [[aphid]]s and have a similarly complex life cycle. Eggs hatch in early spring and the [[gall]]s quickly form around the developing insects. ''Phylloxera'' galls may damage weakened or stressed hickories, but are generally harmless. 
&lt;br/&gt;Deformed leaves and twigs can rain down from the tree in the spring as [[squirrel]]s break off infected tissue and eat the galls, possibly for the protein content or because the galls are fleshy and tasty to the squirrels. The pecan gall curculio (''[[Conotrachelus elegans]]'') is a true weevil species also found feeding on galls of the hickory leaf stem gall phylloxera.

The [[banded hickory borer]] (''Knulliana cincta'') is also found on hickories.

==Fruit==
Some fruits are borderline and difficult to categorize.  Hickory nuts (''Carya'') and walnuts (''[[Juglans]]'') in the [[Juglandaceae]] family grow within an outer husk; these fruits are sometimes considered to be [[drupe]]s or drupaceous nuts, rather than true botanical nuts.  "Tryma" is a specialized term for such nut-like drupes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waynesword.palomar.edu/fruitid1.htm Identification of Major Fruit Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120221956/http://waynesword.palomar.edu/fruitid1.htm |date=2011-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph8.htm|title=Nut Photos|website=waynesword.palomar.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hickory [[wood]] is very hard, stiff, dense and shock resistant. There are woods that are stronger than hickory and woods that are harder, but the combination of strength, toughness, hardness, and stiffness found in hickory wood is not found in any other commercial wood.&lt;ref&gt;Important Trees of Eastern Forests, USDA, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used for [[tool]] handles, [[bow (weapon)|bows]], [[wheel]] spokes, [[cart]]s, [[drum stick|drumsticks]], [[lacrosse]] stick handles, [[golf club (equipment)|golf club]] shafts (sometimes still called ''hickory stick'', even though made of [[steel]] or [[Carbon fiber|graphite]]), the bottom of [[skis]], [[Assistive cane|walking sticks]], and for punitive use as a [[switch (rod)|switch]] (like [[hazel]]), and especially as a cane-like [[caning#Scope of use|hickory stick]] in schools and use by parents.  [[Paddle (spanking)|Paddles]] are often made from hickory. This property of hickory wood has left a trace in some Native American languages: in [[Ojibwe]], hickory is called ''mitigwaabaak'', a compound of ''mitigwaab'' "bow" and the final ''-aakw'' "hardwood tree".&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, Rudolph 2001. ''Nishnaabemwin Grammar'', Toronto: University of Toronto Press. p.485).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baseball bat]]s were formerly made of hickory, but are now more commonly made of [[ash tree|ash]]. Hickory is replacing ash as the wood of choice for Scottish [[shinty]] sticks (also known as camans). Hickory was extensively used for the construction of early aircraft.

Hickory is also highly prized for [[wood-burning stove]]s and [[chiminea]]s because of its high energy content. Hickory wood is also a preferred type for [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]] [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] meats. In the [[Southern United States]], hickory is popular for cooking [[barbecue]], as hickory grows abundantly in the region and adds flavor to the meat.

Hickory is sometimes used for [[wood flooring]] due to its durability in resisting wear and character.  Hickory wood is not noted for rot resistance.

A [[Bark (botany)|bark]] extract from shagbark hickory is also used in an edible syrup similar to [[maple syrup]], with a slightly bitter, smoky taste.

The nuts of some species are palatable, while others are bitter and only suitable for animal feed. Shagbark and shellbark hickory, along with [[pecan]], are regarded by some as the finest nut trees.

When cultivated for their [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s, clonal ([[Grafting|grafted]]) trees of the same [[cultivar]] cannot pollinate each other because of their self-incompatibility. Two or more cultivars must be planted together for successful [[pollination]]. Seedlings (grown from hickory nuts) will usually have sufficient genetic variation.

[[File:Emblem_SS_Ahnenerbe.png|thumb|Irminsul [[SS]] [[Ahnenerbe]] symbol]]
An '''Irminsul''' ([[Old Saxon]], probably "great/mighty pillar" or "arising pillar") was a sacral [[Column|pillar]]-like object attested as playing an important role in the [[Germanic paganism]] of the [[Saxon people]]. The oldest chronicle describing an Irminsul refers to it as a tree trunk erected in the open air.&lt;ref name=DALVIELLA112&gt;d'Alviella (1891), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7qUje6CufvkC&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 112]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the Irminsuls and the implications thereof have been the subject of considerable scholarly discourse and speculation for hundreds of years.

==Etymology==
[[File:Zerstörung der Irminsaule durch Karl den Großen by Heinrich Leutemann.jpg|thumb|"The destruction of Irminsul by Charlemagne" (1882) by [[Heinrich Leutemann]].]]
A Germanic god [[Irminenschaft|Irmin]], inferred from the name Irminsul and the tribal name [[Irminones]], is sometimes presumed to have been the national god or [[demi-god]] of the Saxons.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1917): p.389&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that ''Irmin'' was more probably an aspect or [[epithet]] of some other deity – most likely Wodan ([[Odin]]). Irmin might also have been an epithet of the god Ziu ([[Tyr]]) in early Germanic times, only later transferred to Odin, as certain scholars subscribe to the idea that Odin replaced Tyr as the chief Germanic deity at the onset of the [[Migration Period]]. This was the favored view of early 20th century Nordicist writers,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Meyer (1910): p.192&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not generally considered likely in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Farwerck (1970): p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Norse]] form of ''Irmin'' is ''Jörmunr'', which just like ''[[List of names of Odin|Yggr]]'' was one of the [[List of names of Odin|names]] of Odin. [[Yggdrasil]] ("Yggr's horse") was the [[European Yew|yew]] or [[ash tree]] from which Odin sacrificed himself, and which connected the nine worlds. [[Jakob Grimm]] connects the name ''Irmin'' with [[Old Norse]] terms like ''iörmungrund'' ("great ground", i.e. the Earth) or ''iörmungandr'' ("great snake", i.e. the [[Midgard serpent]]).&lt;ref&gt;Grimm (1835)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attestations==

===Royal Frankish Annals===
According to the [[Royal Frankish Annals]] (772 AD), during the [[Saxon wars]], [[Charlemagne]] is repeatedly described as ordering the destruction of the chief seat of their religion, an Irminsul.&lt;ref name=STALLYBRASS116-118&gt;Stallybrass (1882): 116-118).&lt;/ref&gt; The Irminsul is described as not being far from Heresburg (now [[Obermarsberg]]), Germany.&lt;ref name=STALLYBRASS116-118/&gt; [[Jacob Grimm]] states that "strong reasons" point to the actual location of the Irminsul as being approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} away, in the [[Teutoburg Forest]] and states that the original name for the region "Osning" may have meant "Holy Wood."&lt;ref name=STALLYBRASS116-118/&gt;

===''De miraculis sancti Alexandri''===
The [[Benedictine]] monk [[Rudolf of Fulda]] (AD 865) provides a description of an Irminsul in chapter 3 of his Latin work ''De miraculis sancti Alexandri''. Rudolf's description states that the Irminsul was a great wooden pillar erected and worshipped beneath the open sky and that its name, Irminsul, signifies universal all-sustaining pillar.&lt;ref name=STALLYBRASS116-118/&gt;

===Widukind of Corvey===
Clive Tolley has argued that [[Widukind of Corvey]] in a passage of his ''[[Deeds of the Saxons]]'' (c. 970) is in fact describing an ''ad hoc'' Irminsul erected to celebrate the Saxon leader [[Hadugato]]'s victory over the [[Thuringians]] in 531. Widukind says the Saxons set up an altar to their god of victory, whose body they depicted as a wooden column:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When morning was come they set up an eagle at the eastern gate, and erecting an altar of victory they celebrated appropriate rites with all due solemnity, according to their ancestral superstition: to the one whom they venerate as their god of Victory they give the name of Mars, and the bodily characteristics of Hercules, imitating his physical proportion by means of wooden columns, and in the hierarchy of their gods he is the Sun, or as the Greeks call him, Apollo. From this fact the opinion of those men appears somewhat probable who hold that the Saxons were descended from the Greeks, because the Greeks call Mars Hirmin or Hermes, a word which we use even to this day, either for blame or praise, without knowing its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Raymund F. Wood, ed. and trans., ''The Three Books of the Deeds of the Saxons, by Widukind of Corvey: Translated with Introduction, Notes, and Bibliography'', PhD diss. (University of California, Los Angeles, 1949), pp. 178–79.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Widukind is confused, however, about the name of the god, since the Roman Mars and the Greek Hermes do not correspond. Tolley supposes that the name Hirmin, of which Widukind does not know the meaning, is not to be related to Hermes, but to Irmin, the dedicatee of the Irminsul.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Tolley, "Oswald's Tree", in Tette Hofstra, L. A. J. R. Houwen and Alasdair A. MacDonald, eds., ''Pagans and Christians: The Interplay Between Christian Latin and Traditional Germanic Cultures in Early Medieval Europe'' (Groningen: 1995), pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carole M. Cusack]], ''The Sacred Tree: Ancient and Medieval Manifestations'' (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2011), pp. 137–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hildesheim===
Under [[Louis the Pious]] in the 9th century, a stone column was dug up at [[Obermarsberg]]&lt;ref name=ANNALS&gt;According to the [[Royal Frankish Annals]] (Anonymus ([790]): chapter 772):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Et inde perrexit partibus Saxoniae prima vice, Eresburgum castrum coepit, ad Ermensul usque pervenit et ipsum fanum destruxit et aurum vel argentum, quod ibi repperit, abstulit. Et fuit siccitas magna, ita ut aqua deficeret in supradicto loco, ubi Ermensul stabat; et dum voluit ibi duos aut tres praedictus gloriosus rex stare dies fanum ipsum ad perdestruendum et aquam non haberent, tunc subito divina largiente gratia media die cuncto exercitu quiescente in quodam torrente omnibus hominibus ignorantibus aquae effusae sunt largissimae, ita ut cunctus exercitus sufficienter haberet.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Westphalia]], Germany and relocated to the [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Hildesheim|Hildesheim cathedral]] in [[Hildesheim]], [[Lower Saxony]], Germany. The column was reportedly then used as a [[candelabrum]] until at least the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=DALVIELLA106&gt;d'Alviella (1891), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7qUje6CufvkC&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 106-107]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, the destruction of the Irminsul by Charlemagne was recorded as having still been commemorated at Hildesheim on the Saturday after [[Laetare Sunday]].&lt;ref name=DALVIELLA112/&gt;

The commemoration was reportedly done by planting two poles six feet high, each surmounted by a wooden object one foot in height shaped like a pyramid or a cone on the cathedral square.&lt;ref name=DALVIELLA112/&gt; The youth then used sticks and stones in an attempt to knock over the object.&lt;ref name=DALVIELLA112/&gt; This custom is described as existing elsewhere in Germany, particularly in [[Halberstadt]] where it was enacted on the day of Laetare Sunday by the [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] themselves.&lt;ref name=DALVIELLA112/&gt;

===''Kaiserchronik''===
[[File:Irminsul nach Sebastian Münster.Ca. 1590.JPG|thumb|A late 16th century interpretation of an Irminsul bearing the cult image of a god of war and commerce, from [[Sebastian Münster]]'s ''[[Cosmographia (Sebastian Münster)|Cosmographia]]'']]
Awareness of the significance of the concept seems to have persisted well into Christian times. For example, in the twelfth-century ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'' an Irminsul is mentioned in three instances:

Concerning the origin of the Wednesday:
:''ûf ainer irmensiule / stuont ain abgot ungehiure, / daz hiezen si ir choufman.''&lt;ref&gt;Schröder (1892): p.81, lines 129-131&lt;/ref&gt;
:"On an Irminsul / stands an enormous idol / which they call their merchant"

Concerning [[Julius Caesar]]:
:''Rômâre in ungetrûwelîche sluogen / sîn gebaine si ûf ain irmensûl begruoben''&lt;ref&gt;Schröder (1892): p.92, lines 601-602&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The Romans slew him treacherously / and buried his bones on an Irminsul"

Concerning [[Nero]]:
:''ûf ain irmensûl er staich / daz lantfolch im allez naich.''&lt;ref&gt;Schröder (1892): p.158, lines 4213-4214&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He climbed upon an Irminsul / the peasants all bowed before him"

==Hypotheses==
A number of theories surround the subject of the Irminsul.

===''Germania''===
In [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', the author mentions rumors of what he describes as "[[Pillars of Hercules]]" in land inhabited by the [[Frisii]] that had yet to be explored.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus ([98]): chapter 34&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus adds that these pillars exist either because [[Hercules]] actually did go there or because the Romans have agreed to ascribe all marvels anywhere to Hercules' credit. Tacitus states that while [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus Germanicus]] was daring in his campaigns against the Germanic tribes, he was unable to reach this region, and that subsequently no one had yet made the attempt.&lt;ref name=BIRLEY55&gt;Birley (1999:55).&lt;/ref&gt; Connections have been proposed between these "Pillars of Hercules" and later accounts of the Irminsuls.&lt;ref name=DALVIELLA112/&gt; [[Hercules]] was probably frequently identified with [[Thor]] by the Romans due to the practice of ''[[Interpretatio graeca|interpretatio romana]]''.&lt;ref name=RIVES160&gt;Rives (1999:160).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Externsteine relief and site===
[[File:Extern-Relief-P1050037.jpg|thumb|On the [[Externsteine]] [[Descent from the Cross]] relief, the bent structure in the right centre is popularly identified as Irminsul.&lt;br/&gt;Though this may be correct, it is not supported by any contemporary sources.]]
According to one particularly well-known suggestion, an Irminsul was situated at or near the [[Externsteine]], a famous rock formation near [[Detmold]], Germany. A Christian relief on the Externsteine (see photo above) depicts what has been described as a bent tree-like design at the feet of [[Nicodemus]].  This artwork, variously dated to the early ninth to early twelfth century AD, is popularly believed to represent the bent or fallen Irminsul beneath a triumphant Christianity.

While both the artwork and the Irminsul were known to scholars for centuries - [[Goethe]] for example discussed the relief in detail&lt;ref&gt;von Goethe (1824)&lt;/ref&gt; -, they were not connected until the 1929 interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Teudt (1929): p.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; of lay [[archaeologist]] [[Wilhelm Teudt]].&lt;ref&gt;Halle (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 to 1935, the [[Ahnenerbe]] undertook extensive fieldwork in an attempt to uncover material evidence of the use of the Externsteine as a place of Germanic paganism worship, yet no such evidence was found.

Few modern scholars&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Matthes &amp; Speckner (1997) for some who accept Teudt's proposal, but note that their work has several serious flaws. For example, they ignore the lack of archaeological evidence for [[Iron Age]] use of the Externsteine as a sacred site. Also, their claim that the figure of Nicodemus standing on the design represents the subjugation of the pagan faith (p.191) has been claimed as being based on a mistranslation of ''Nikodemos'' (Νικόδημος, "Victory of the people") as "Victory ''over'' the [Saxon] people".&lt;/ref&gt; consider it anything but an outright invention of Teudt, who did not provide evidence to back his claims.

Today it is generally accepted by historians that there is no historic attestation connecting the Externsteine to the Irminsul. Certainly, the Eresburg was only about 45 kilometers (c.28 miles) from the Externsteine, and there indeed was an Irminsul "near the Externsteine", but extensive [[archaeological]] studies of the Externsteine have failed to yield any material evidence for their use as a sacred site between [[Mesolithic]] and pre-Christian times. [[Thermoluminescence dating]] of firesites suggests that the site was occasionally used as a [[rock shelter]] in Saxon times, but apparently not to the extent one would expect from a major place of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt &amp; Halle (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jupiter Columns===
Comparisons have been made between the Irminsul and the [[Jupiter Column]]s that were erected along the [[Rhine]] in [[Germania]] around the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE. Scholarly comparisons were once made between the Irminsul and the Jupiter Columns; however, Rudolf Simek states that the columns were of [[Gallo-Roman religion|Gallo-Roman religious]] monuments, and that the reported location of the Irminsul in [[Eresburg]] does not fall within the area of the Jupiter Column archaeological finds.&lt;ref name=SIMEK175-176&gt;Simek (2007:175-176).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopaganism==

An '''isopycnal''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|s|ə|ˈ|p|ɪ|k|n|l}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/isopycnal |publisher=Dictionary.com |title=Isopycnal |accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a line connecting points of a specific [[density]] or [[potential density]]. Isopycnals are often displayed graphically to help visualize "layers" of water in the ocean or gases in the atmosphere in a similar manner to how [[contour lines]] are used in topographic maps to help visualize [[topography]].

== Types ==

=== Oceanography ===
In [[oceanography]], isopycnals are used to display the vertical distribution of water density. In a body of water, as the depth increases, so does the density. Varying degrees of salinity, temperature, and pressure act to modify the density of water, and the denser water always lies below the less dense water.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.rsmas.miami.edu/personal/lbeal/MPO%20503/Lectures%203%264.html Lectures 3&amp;4: Properties of Seawater] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920042834/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/personal/lbeal/MPO%20503/Lectures%203%264.html |date=2014-09-20 }}'', Lisa Beal, University of Miami. Retrieved December 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This creates distinguishable layers of water with differing physical properties. This phenomenon is called [[Stratification (water)|stratification]]. The strata are held in place by the large differences in physical and chemical properties between layers that prevent mixing. [[Turbulence]] can disturb boundaries between the layers, causing them to bend, which causes the isopycnals to appear uneven. The ways in which the isopycnals are transformed can be used by oceanographers to identify the force that caused the underwater disturbance.

=== Meteorology ===
In [[meteorology]], isopycnals are used to display different layers of gases in the atmosphere. In the atmosphere, varying degrees of humidity, temperature, and pressure change the density of air. Isopycnals are not used in meteorology as frequently as they are in oceanography, since the density gradients observed in the atmosphere are typically gradual,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/atmos/pressure.htm Air Pressure]'', National Weather Service, 2012. Retrieved December 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; unlike in stratified bodies of water. In these cases, isopycnals are less relevant, as they do not display any substantial features.

A {{nihongo|'''kappa'''|'''河童'''|, ''river-child''}}, also known as {{Nihongo|'''kawatarō'''|'''川太郎'''|, "river-boy"}}, {{nihongo|'''komahiki'''|'''駒引'''|, ''horse-puller''}}, or {{nihongo|'''kawatora'''|'''川虎'''|, ''river-tiger''}} is an amphibious [[yōkai]] [[demon]] or [[imp]] found in traditional [[Japanese folklore]]. They are typically depicted as green, human-like beings with webbed hands and feet, with a [[Turtle shell|turtle]]-like [[carapace]] on their backs. A depression on its head called its "dish" (''sara'') retains water, and if this is damaged or its liquid is spilled the kappa is severely weakened.

The kappa are known to favor [[cucumbers]] and love to engage in [[sumo wrestling]]. They are often accused of assaulting humans in water and removing a mythical organ called the ''shirikodama'' from their victim's [[anus]].

There are more than eighty other names associated with the ''kappa'' in different regions, including ''kawappa'', ''gawappa'', ''kawako'', ''gatarō'', ''mizuchi''.

==Terminology==
The name ''kappa'' is a combination of the words ''kawa'' (river) and ''wappa'', a [[doublet (linguistics)|variant form]] of 童 ''warawa'' (also ''warabe'') "child". The ''kappa'' are also known regionally by at least eighty other names such as ''kawappa'', ''kawako'', ''kawatarō'', ''gawappa'', ''kōgo'', ''mizushi'', ''mizuchi'', ''suitengu''.&lt;ref name=foster1998-ono-1994&gt;{{harvp|Foster|1998|p=3}}, citing Ōno (1994), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Its names ''kawaso'' meaning "otter", ''dangame'' "soft-shelled turtle", and ''enkō'' "monkey" suggest its outward resemblance to these animals. The name ''komahiki'' or "steed-puller" alludes to its reputed penchant to drag away horses.&lt;ref name=foster1998-ono-1994/&gt;

The kappa has been known as ''kawako'' in Izumo ([[Shimane Prefecture]]) where [[Lafcadio Hearn]] was based,&lt;ref name=hearn/&gt; and ''gatarō'' was the familiar name of it to folklorist [[Kunio Yanagita]] from [[Hyogo Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Irokawa |first=Daikichi |title=The Culture of the Meiji Period |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goYOPty1L1oC&amp;pg=PA21 |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-691-00030-5 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
[[File:Kappa jap myth.jpg|thumb|Kappa. — From ''[[Gazu Hyakki Yagyō]]'' ("The Illustrated Night Parade of a Hundred Demons") by [[Toriyama Sekien]]]]

The ''kappa'' is said to be roughly humanoid in form and about the size of a child, inhabiting the [[pond]]s and [[river]]s of [[Japan]].{{sfnp|Foster|2015|p=157}} It is typically greenish in color{{sfnp|Foster|2015|p=88}} (or yellow-blue{{sfnp|Foster|1998|p=4}}), and either scaly&lt;ref name="Frederic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Volker"/&gt; or slimy skinned, with webbed hands and feet, with a [[Turtle shell|turtle]]-like [[carapace]] on its back.{{sfnp|Foster|2015|p=88}}

One peculiar trait is that it has a cavity on its head called a ''sara'' ("dish", "bowl", or "[[plate (dishware)]]") that retains water or some sort of liquid, which is regarded as the source of the ''kappa'''s power or life force. This cavity must be full whenever a ''kappa'' is away from the water; if it ever dries out, or if its water is spilled, ''kappa'' loses its power and may even die.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Foster|1998|p=4}}; {{harvp|Foster|2015|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" Volker" /&gt; The ''kappa'' are sometimes said to smell like [[fish]]&lt;!--fishy--&gt;{{sfnp|Foster|1998|p=4}} and they can swim like them.

According to some accounts, its arms are connected to each other through the torso and can slide from one side to the other.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Wakan Sansai Zue]]''. {{harvp|Foster|1998|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they are primarily water creatures, they do on occasion venture onto land. When they do, the "dish" on their head can be covered with a metal cap for protection.&lt;ref name=Ashkenazi&gt;{{cite book |title= ''Handbook of Japanese Mythology''|last= Ashkenazi|first= Michael|authorlink= |year= 2003 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |location= |isbn= 978-1-57607-467-1|page= |pages= 195–196|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqs-y9R2AekC |accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hairy ''kappa'' is called a {{illm|hyōsube|ja|ひょうすべ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/2220015.shtml|publisher=[[International Research Center for Japanese Studies]]|script-title=ja:怪異・妖怪伝承データベース: カッパ，　ヒョウスベ|trans-title=''Folktale Data of Strange Phenomena and Yōkai''|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior {{anchor|Shirikodama}}==
[[File:Takagi Toranosuke capturing a kappa underwater in the Tamura river.jpg|thumb|Capturing a kappa alive. [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]]]
''Kappa'' are usually seen as mischievous troublemakers or trickster figures. Their pranks range from the relatively innocent, such as looking up women's [[kimono]]s, to the malevolent, such as drowning people and animals, kidnapping children, raping women and at times eating human flesh.&lt;ref name=Ashkenazi/&gt; Though sometimes menacing, it may also behave amicably towards humans.&lt;ref name="Frederic"/&gt;

===Cucumber===
Folk beliefs claim the [[cucumber]] as their traditional favorite meal.&lt;ref name=Ashkenazi/&gt; At festivals, offerings of cucumber are frequently made to the kappa.{{sfnp|Foster|1998|p=5}} Sometimes the kappa is said to have other favorite foods, such as the Japanese [[eggplant]], ''[[soba]]'' (buckwheat noodles), ''[[nattō]]'' (fermented soybeans), or ''[[kabocha]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Foster|1998|p=5}}, citing {{illm|Takeda Akira{{!}}Takeda, Akira|ja|竹田旦}} (1988), "''Suijinshinkō to kappa'' 水神信仰と河童 [Water deity belief and the kappa]"; Ōshima, Takehiko ed. &lt;!--大島建彦--&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OR5NAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%E6%B2%B3%E7%AB%A5+%22%E5%8D%97%E7%93%9C%22 ''Kappa'' 河童], p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Edo (old Tokyo), there used to be a tradition where people would write the names of their family members on cucumbers and send them afloat into the streams to mollify the ''kappa'', to prevent the family from coming to harm in the streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/0030086.shtml |publisher=[[International Research Center for Japanese Studies]]|script-title=ja:怪異・妖怪伝承データベース: 河童雑談|trans-title=''Folktale Data of Strange Phenomena and Yōkai''|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions, it was customary to eat cucumbers before swimming as protection, but in others it was believed that this act would guarantee an attack.{{sfnp|Foster|1998|p=5}}

A cucumber-filled [[sushi]] roll is known as ''[[kappamaki]]''.&lt;ref name=Ashkenazi/&gt;{{sfnp|Foster|2015|p=157}}

===As a menace===

As water monsters, ''kappa'' have been blamed for drownings, and are often said to try to lure people into water and pull them in with their great skill at [[wrestling]].&lt;ref name=Ashkenazi/&gt; They are sometimes said to take their victims for the purpose of drinking their blood, eating their livers, or gaining power by taking their {{nihongo|''shirikodama''|尻子玉|}}, a mythical ball said to contain the soul, which is located inside the anus.&lt;ref name=Ashkenazi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Kappa'' have been used to warn children of the dangers lurking in rivers and lakes, as ''kappa'' have been often said to try to lure people to water and pull them in.&lt;ref name="Hanami"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ashkenazi/&gt; Even today, signs warning about ''kappa'' appear by bodies of water in some Japanese towns and villages.[[File:Kappa Warning Sign Fukuoka 2018-Oct-7.jpg|thumb|right|Sign warnign of Kappas on a fence surrounding a lake in Fukuoka]]

''Kappa'' are also said to victimize animals, especially horses and cows. The motif of the ''kappa'' trying to drown a horse is found all over Japan.&lt;ref name=Kappalegend&gt;{{harvp|Ishida|Yoshida|1950|pp=1–2, 114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lafcadio Hearn]] wrote of a story in Kawachimura near [[Matsue]] where a horse-stealing kappa was captured and made to write a sworn statement vowing never to harm people again.&lt;ref name=hearn&gt;{{cite book |last=Hearn |first=Lafcadio  |author-link=Lafcadio Hearn |title=Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan |place= |publisher=Tauchnitz |year=1910 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwhLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA303 |pages=302–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis" &gt;{{cite book |title=Myths and Legends of Japan |first=F.

Crowell Co. |pages=350–351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many versions the ''kappa'' is dragged by the horse to the stable where it is most vulnerable, and it is there it is forced to submit a writ of promise not to misbehave.{{sfnp|Foster|1998|p=8, 10}}

===Defeating the kappa===
[[File:YoshitoshiKappaControl.jpg|thumb|Defense against Kappa. [[Yoshitoshi]]]]

It was believed that there were a few means of escape if one was confronted with a ''kappa''. ''Kappa'' are obsessed with politeness, so if a person makes a deep bow, it will return the gesture. This results in the kappa spilling the water held in the "dish" (''sara'') on its head, rendering it unable to leave the bowing position until the plate is refilled with water from the river in which it lives. If a person refills it, the ''kappa'' will serve that person for all eternity.&lt;ref name=Ashkenazi/&gt; A similar weakness of the ''kappa'' involves its arms, which can easily be pulled from its body. If an arm is detached, the ''kappa'' will perform favors or share knowledge in exchange for its return.{{sfnp|Foster|1998|p=8}}

Another method of defeat involves ''[[shogi]]'' or ''[[sumo]]'' wrestling: a ''kappa'' sometimes challenges a human being to wrestle or engage in other tests of skill.&lt;ref name="Foster"/&gt; This tendency is easily used to encourage the ''kappa'' to spill the water from its ''sara''. One notable example of this method is the folktale of a farmer who promises his daughter's hand in marriage to a ''kappa'' in return for the creature irrigating his land. The farmer's daughter challenges the ''kappa'' to submerge several gourds in water. When the ''kappa'' fails in its task, it retreats, saving the farmer's daughter from the marriage.{{sfnp|Foster|1998|p=5}} ''Kappa'' have also been driven away by their aversion to iron, sesame, or ginger.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Foster|1998|p=6}}, citing Ōno (1994), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Good deeds===
''Kappa'' are not entirely antagonistic to human beings.

Once befriended, ''kappa'' may perform any number of tasks for human beings, such as helping farmers [[irrigation|irrigate]] their land. Sometimes, they bring fresh fish, which is regarded as a mark of good fortune for the family that receives it.{{sfnp|Foster|1998|p=8}} They are also highly knowledgeable about [[medicine]], and legend states that they taught the art of [[bone setting]] to human beings.&lt;ref name=Ashkenazi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/0160053.shtml |publisher=[[International Research Center for Japanese Studies]]|script-title=ja:怪異・妖怪伝承データベース: 河童の教えた中風の薬|trans-title=''Folktale Data of Strange Phenomena and Yōkai''|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/C0411189-000.shtml |publisher=[[International Research Center for Japanese Studies]]|script-title=ja:怪異・妖怪伝承データベース: 河童の秘伝接骨薬|trans-title=''Folktale Data of Strange Phenomena and Yōkai''|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Localizations==
Along with the ''[[oni]]'' and the ''[[tengu]]'', the ''kappa'' is among the best-known ''yōkai'' in Japan.&lt;ref name="youkaizukan"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Kyōgoku | first1 = Natsuhiko | authorlink1 = Natsuhiko Kyogoku | last2 = Tada | first2 = Katsumi | title = ''Yōkai zuka'' | language = Japanese | year = 2000 | publisher = Kokusho Kankōkai | location = Tōkyō | isbn = 978-4-336-04187-6 | pages = 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gensousekai"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Tada | first= Katsumi | script-title=ja:幻想世界の住人たち|language=Japanese|year=1990|publisher=新紀元社|series=Truth In Fantasy|volume=IV|isbn=978-4-915146-44-2|pages=110| title= 幻想世界の住人たち Iv 日本編 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kappa is known by various names of the creature vary by region and local folklore.&lt;ref name=foster1998-ono-1994/&gt; In [[Shintō]], they are often considered to be an avatar (''keshin'') of the Water Deity or ''[[suijin]]''.&lt;ref name=" Frédéric"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=''Japan Encyclopedia''|first=Louis |last=Frédéric|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA910 |publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard Colleg e|year=2002|isbn=978-0-674-00770-3|page=910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jinja (Shinto)|Shrine]]s are dedicated to the worship of ''kappa'' as water deity in such places as [[Aomori Prefecture]]&lt;ref name="Frederic"/&gt; or [[Miyagi Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/C0410236-000.shtml |publisher=[[International Research Center for Japanese Studies]]|script-title=ja:怪異・妖怪伝承データベース: 河童神社|trans-title=''Folktale Data of Strange Phenomena and Yōkai''|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also festivals meant to placate the ''kappa'' in order to obtain a good harvest, some of which still take place today. These festivals generally took place during the two equinoxes of the year, when the ''kappa'' are said to travel from the rivers to the mountains and vice versa.{{sfnp|Foster|1998|p=9}}

The best known place where it has been claimed Kappa reside is in the {{illm|Kappabuchi|ja|カッパ淵}} waters of ''[[Tōno, Iwate|Tōno]] '' in the [[Iwate Prefecture]]. The nearby {{illm|Jōkenji|ja|常堅寺}}&lt;!--''Fukusenji''--&gt; In Tōno, there is a Buddhist temple that has [[komainu]] dog statues with depressions on their heads reminiscent of the water-retaining dish on the kappa's heads, said to be dedicated to the ''kappa'' which according to legend helped extinguish a fire at the temple&lt;!--in the early 17th-century--&gt;&lt;!--by sacrificing their water bowls and themselves to save the temple and its many treasures--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Masatoshi |first=Naitō (内藤正敏) |script-title=遠野物語の原風景 |title=Tōno monogatari no gen fūkei |trans-title=Original landscape of the Tōno monogatari |page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUo0AQAAIAAJ|year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kappa is also venerated at the ''[[Kappa-dera|Sogenji]]'' Buddhist temple in the [[Asakusa]] district of [[Tokyo]] where according to tradition, a [[mummified]] arm of a Kappa is enshrined within the chapel hall since 1818.

In his ''Tōno Monogatari'', [[Kunio Yanagita]] records a number of beliefs from the [[Tōno, Iwate|Tōno]] area about women being accosted and even impregnated by ''kappa''.&lt;ref name=Tatsumi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tatsumi|first1=Takayuki|last2=|first2=|year=1998|title=Deep North Gothic: A Comparative Cultural Reading of Kunio Yanagita's ''Tono Monogatari'' and Tetsutaro Murano's ''The Legend of Sayo''|journal=''Newsletter of the Council for the Literature of the Fantastic''|volume=1|issue=5|pages=|doi=|url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/english/clf/n5_a1.html|accessdate=December 22, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607011127/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/english/clf/n5_a1.html|archivedate=June 7, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their offspring were said to be repulsive to behold, and were generally buried.&lt;ref name=Tatsumi/&gt;

Similar folklore can be found in Asia and Europe. The Japanese folklore creature ''Kappa'' is known in Chinese folklore as 水鬼&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 水鬼_水鬼[传说的角色]_互动百科|url = http://www.baike.com/wiki/%25E6%25B0%25B4%25E9%25AC%25BC|website = www.baike.com|access-date = 2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Shui Gui", Water Ghost, or [[water monkey]] and may also be related to the [[Kelpie]] of Scotland and the [[Neck (water spirit)|Neck]] of Scandinavia.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Like the Japanese description of the beast, in Chinese and in Scandinavian lore this beast is infamous for kidnapping and drowning people as well as horses. The [[Siyokoy (Philippine mythology)|Siyokoy]] of the Philippine islands is also known for kidnapping children by the water's edge. A frog-face [[vodyanoy]] is known in Russian mythology. Green human-like being named ''vodnik'' is widely known in western Slavic folklore and tales, especially in Czech republic or Slovakia.

== In media==
[[Mizuki Shigeru]] wrote about kappa in his work ''Kappa no Sanpei'' and a bronze statue of a kappa has been installed on the road named after him in Tottori.

In Japan, the character Sagojō ([[Sha Wujing]]) is conventionally depicted as a ''kappa'': he being a comrade of the magic monkey [[Sun Wukong|Gokū]] in the Chinese story ''[[Journey to the West]]''.&lt;ref name="Hanami"&gt;[http://road-station.com/2014/03/does-kappa-still-have-their-occult-power/ Does Kappa still have their occult power?]. road-station.com (Michi-no-eiki).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hellboy fights a kappa in the animated ''[[Hellboy: Sword of Storms]]''. The kappa tries to steal the Sword of Storms from Hellboy but loses after a local Japanese man (who was carving the names of the local villages into cucumbers so that the villages wouldn’t get eaten by the Kappa) advises Hellboy to "spill his water" - having done so the kappa becomes weak and eventually shrivels up.

Kappas are a recurring image in [[David Peace]]'s novel ''Patient X'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Patient X : the case-book of Ryūnosuke Akutagawa |last=Peace |first=David |isbn=978-0-5255-2177-8 |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=2018 |oclc=1013525517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about the life and work of [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]].

In the Cartoon Network series ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes]]'', KO's friend Dendy is revealed to be a kappa. 

Kappas appear in some of the [[Story of Seasons]] video games, often providing gifts if the player throws fish or cucumbers into their ponds. It is also possible for the protagonist in [[More Friends of Mineral Town]] to marry a Kappa.

In [[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald]], a Kappa is seen as a circus attraction.

'''Acamarians''' are a generally peaceful race with a history of violent clan wars.  Physically, they can be distinguished by a vertical crease in the center of the forehead.  A splinter group, known as the Gatherers, composed of members of various Acamarian clans who opposed the peace treaty for about 100 years, was eventually repatriated into Acamarian society.

|-
|colspan="2"| '''Aenar''', along with the [[Andorian]]s, inhabit the world of [[Andorian|Andor]] (Andoria). In many regards, they are similar to the [[Andorian]]s in physical appearance. However, their skin is a light blue/white color, they are almost totally blind, and they have powerful telepathic abilities. Aenar are pacifistic and do not use their mind reading abilities against the will of another individual. However, their blindness does not appear to hinder their ability to know that they are in the presence of a "blueskin" Andorian or detect obstacles.

Aenar government, such as it is, has little structure; leaders of Aenar society are chosen as the need arises, usually when contact with outsiders is called for. The Aenar are usually considered to be just a different [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] of the Andorian race and not an utterly separate species.

The Aenar population is about 11,000 in size and they inhabit the polar region of their world. Andorians believed the Aenar to be mythical creatures before their existence was confirmed circa 2104.

:''Based on Talla, Shran's daughter from "These Are the Voyages...", it has been speculated that hybrids of an Andorian and an Aenar would be a greenish color, perhaps explaining the greenish Andorian seen in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.''

The Denobulans have tried to put the war behind them; however, there are still Denobulans who hate the Antarans. The Antarans remain bitter and are raised from birth to hate Denobulans.

|-
|colspan="2"| Usually considered non-violent, '''Angosian''' authorities were responsible for [[genetic engineering|genetically]] and chemically engineering [[soldier]]s to fight in their Tarsian Wars. But the process was irreversible, and the 'super soldiers' were considered outcasts and criminals that could not function or co-exist alongside the normal population of Angosian society, and as such were forced to be permanently confined to a penal settlement on an Angosian moon.

: '''Non-canon: a novel trilogy, ''[[Star Trek: The Q Continuum]]'' shows that the Angosians have had some success in later efforts to reintegrate the soldiers, as one now serves on the Enterprise-E.'''

| &lt;span id="Antedean"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; '''Antedean'''
| Antede III
|rowspan="2"| "[[Manhunt (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Manhunt]]" (TNG)
|-
|colspan="2"| The '''Antedeans''' from Antede III are an ichthyohumanoid species which resemble fish. While a member of the [[United Federation of Planets]], they seldom receive visitors and thus have not been seen by many members of the Federation. Another trait that keeps them from interacting with their fellow Federation members is a strong distaste for space flight: although the Antedeans are a space-going race, space travel is quite traumatic for them. In order for individuals to deal with this problem they induce a catatonic state while in space flight. To awaken from this state takes several hours. Once awakened from the sleep Antedeans are generally ravenous and eat large portions of [[Manhunt (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|vermicula]].

There is a division in the Antedean race on whether membership in the Federation is a good thing. [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: The Next Generation#Lwaxana Troi|Ambassador Lwaxana Troi]] foiled a plot on [[Stardate]] 42859.2 when 2 Antedeans tried to sabotage their planet's Federation membership conference on [[Manhunt (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Pacifica]] with ultritium concealed in their garments.

|-
|colspan="2"| The '''Anticans''' are dog-like with snouts, dark fur and white hair. They applied for Federation membership but the ruling decision was put off because of their hostilities with their neighbors, the reptilian [[#Selay|Selay]]. In a quest for meat, the Antican diplomatic team attempted to cook and consume a member of the Selay delegation.

|colspan="2"| '''Arcturians''' are known for their [[cloning|clone]]s which have the appearance of melted skin and hail from the densely populated world Arcturus.

: ''Nothing has been revealed about them in dialogue, so their backstory (by Fred Phillips and Robert Fletcher) is considered semi-[[canon (fiction)|canon]].''

| &lt;!-- Home planet info --&gt;
|rowspan="2"| &lt;!-- List of introductory/key episodes for each series/movies --&gt;
|-
|colspan="2"| The '''Axanar''' are the first extraterrestrial race befriended by Earth people aboard the NX-01 ''Enterprise''. Archer and his people attempt to rescue Axanar aboard a ship that has been disabled, but they are already dead, and when both another Axanar ship, and the preying ship, show up, Archer is able to persuade the Axanar to help him fight off the preying ship.

One of James T. Kirk's earliest commendations is the Palm Leaf of Axanar Peace Mission, following the Battle of Axanar; although the exact nature of the conflict is unrevealed, it is revealed in the episode "[[Whom Gods Destroy (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Whom Gods Destroy]]" that [[Starfleet]] Captain [[Whom Gods Destroy (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Garth of Izar]] achieved a great victory on behalf of the Federation, and his strategies became required reading at [[Starfleet Academy]] (since Kirk himself studied these strategies, the Battle of Axanar must thus have occurred well before Kirk entered Starfleet Academy in 2250, which was itself almost 20 years before "Whom Gods Destroy"). Kirk claims that the Axanar Peace Mission "topped [Garth's victory] with a greater one" and preserved the civilization that made [[Spock]] and himself "brothers", implying that the mission may have contributed to healing a serious rift in the Federation at that time.

|colspan="2"| The '''Bajorans'''  are a humanoid species with characteristic nose creases. They live on the planet Bajor. They are a deeply spiritual people, who worship The Prophets.

|
|rowspan="2"| ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]''
|-
|colspan="2"| The Ba'ku people were a [[technology|technologically]] advanced [[humanoid]] civilization. In the early 21st century, the race developed the means of building weapons of mass destruction and was on the brink of self-annihilation. A small enlightened group of the Ba'ku people escaped this horror and found an isolated planet.

This group of Ba'ku followed a simple way of life and disdained the use of technology. (As shown in the film ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'', however, the Ba'ku still possessed some form of technology and the ability to use it in emergencies, since they had attempted to repair the damaged [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]].) At first the Ba'ku were unaware of the metaphasic [[radiation]] in the planet's rings, which caused their aging process to significantly decelerate, although it was later discovered and cherished.

The Ba'ku society consisted of strong bonds between each individual as there were less than a thousand living in a village. Their simpler way of life eventually prompted some of the younger Ba'ku villagers - who wanted to explore the galaxy with offlanders - to rebel against their elders, and an attempt was made to take over the village. When they were unsuccessful, they were exiled and eventually became the [[Son'a]] people.

In 2375 peace on the Ba'ku planet was restored, and several members of the Son'a returned to their families.

|-
|colspan="2"| The '''Bandi''' are a humanoid species native to the planet Deneb IV in the [[Galactic quadrant|Alpha Quadrant]]. The Bandi appealed to the [[United Federation of Planets]] for membership in 2364 but were rejected because they had captured and enslaved an alien life form.

Perhaps purely by coincidence, "Bandi" was the name of a vaguely [[Bear|ursine]] empathic parasite in an early ''[[Star Trek]]'' story premise by [[David Gerrold]], who was involved in the development of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', and who novelized "Encounter at Farpoint".

|colspan="2"| When Lieutenant Commander [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] takes temporary command of the USS ''Sutherland'' during the [[Klingon]] Civil War, his first officer on the ''Sutherland'', Lieutenant Commander Thomas Hobson, implies that, as an android, Data is out of place commanding a Federation starship. Hobson compares the apparent dichotomy to that posed by a Klingon counselor or a '''Berellian''' engineer; "they're just not suited for those positions."

|colspan="2"| '''Benzites''' are a humanoid race from the planet [[List of Star Trek planets (A–B)#B|Benzar]] and members of the [[United Federation of Planets]].

Benzites possess smooth, hairless skin; it may range in color from bluish-purple to green-blue. A thick protrusion of the Benzite skull extends down over the face, displaying a prominent nasal lobe and brow. Two fish-like [[Barbel (anatomy)|barbels]] droop down from above the upper lip. Benzites are highly resistant to poisons and other noxious substances. They can digest and derive nutrition from almost any organic compound. All Benzites from the same geostructure are physically similar, so much so that they are indistinguishable to a non-Benzite.

|-
|colspan="2"| The '''Betazoid''' are a humanoid species, originating from the planet Betazed. They are telepathic and are members of the [[United Federation of Planets]]. Star Trek: The Next Generation features Counsellor [[Deanna Troi]], a half-betazoid half-human, as a major cast member and part of the bridge crew. She is featured in almost all TNG episodes and movies, and there are several episodes that focus on the Betazoid people. These include shows with her mother, [[Lwaxana Troi]]. Her romantic interests, family, and personal life are plot elements in many Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes over the course of the series. Episodes usually feature Troi using her telepathic abilities to help the crew better understand enemies and allies. See also [[:Category:Betazoids]]

|-
|colspan="2"| '''Bolians''' are humanoids with blue skin and a small ridge running from the back of their heads to their noses. They were named after a regular ''Star Trek'' director, [[Cliff Bole]]. As an [[in-joke]] there have been references to the "Cliffs of Bole" on their planet. [[Neelix]] remarks that malfunctioning toilets will hit the Bolians especially hard, and during medical examinations 24th century doctors will commonly ask if a human patient has had sexual relations with a Bolian.

The Bolians have been active members of the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] since 2320. Aside from contributing to the ranks of [[Starfleet]] they have a delegation within the [[Federation Diplomatic Corps|Diplomatic Corps]]. In 2366, the Bolian government was maintaining an uneasy truce with the [[Moropa]] ([[Star Trek: The Next Generation|TNG]]: "[[Allegiance (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Allegiance]]").

The Bolians are known to make a crystal steel that is highly prized. They also own and operate the famous Bank of Bolius. In 2373, the Bolian government authorized the [[Ferengi]] [[Ferengi Gaming Commission|Gaming Commission]] to manage their gambling emporiums.

During the Bolian Middle Ages the Bolians developed the medical [[philosophy]] known as the "[[Double Effect Principle]]" about [[euthanasia]]. This form of assisted suicide states that while euthanasia has the effect of relieving suffering it also has the effect of causing death. Bolian marriages often involve more than two members. Any additional spouse is referred to as a "co-husband" or "co-wife", respectively. Bolian [[blues]] is a highly appreciated musical genre among Federation species.

|colspan="2"| While actually encountered in the ''Enterprise'' episode "[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]", the '''''Borg''''' were not truly identified as the single greatest threat to the Federation until the events of The ''Next Generation'' episode "[[Q Who?]]".
The Borg were discovered to be a group without individuality, where every member is a part of a collective consciousness in an attempt to achieve perfection. They assimilate any species they come into contact with for either biological aspects (for example, Talaxians would be assimilated for their dense physical structure, useful for producing strong, resilient drones) or technological aspects (a species which has developed advanced engines or weaponry would be a sufficiently desirable target for assimilation) all in an attempt to further improve the overall perfection of the Borg as a whole.

The Borg have encountered and assimilated thousands of species, quantity most notable by their designation of Species 8472, although more may have been added to the total since that encounter.

The Borg are not so much a species, as a collection of species. In their assimilated state, most races are altered or augmented with cybernetic enhancements which make them all look similar, or at least instantly identifiable as Borg, making them a pseudo-species.

Encounters with the Borg have varied in type, from the disastrous defense of the Wolf 359 system ("[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]"), in which many Federation ships were lost, the successful repelling of two Borg cubes from Sector 001 on two separate occasions ("[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]" "[[Star Trek: First Contact]]") and the infiltration, usage of and destruction of a Borg transwarp hub (a critical part of their interstellar menace) by the USS Voyager ("[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]").

Edosians (aka Edoans) are a race of sentient tripedal beings. Edosians have an orange complexion, two yellow eyes, three arms and three dog-like legs. Navigator Lieutenant [[List of Star Trek characters (A–F)#Arex|Arex]] was introduced in ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'', but his planet of origin, [[Edos (fictional planet)|Edos]], was mentioned only in background material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danhausertrek.com/AnimatedSeries/ArexBio.html Biography of Lt. Arex] published by Lincoln Enterprises in 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Passing references to Edosian [[flora]] and [[fauna]] have been made in episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]''. In some tie-in novels and short stories, Arex is mentioned as actually being a [[Triexian]], with the Edosians being a near-identical race.

===El-Aurian===
&lt;!-- [[El Aurian]], [[El-Aurian]], [[El-Aurians]], and [[The Race of Listeners]] link here. Please don't delete or rename this section without FIRST correcting all incoming links. --&gt;
'''El-Aurians''' (referred to as a '''Race of Listeners''' by [[Dr. Tolian Soran]], the El-Aurian antagonist in ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'') are a [[humanoid]] race first introduced in the second season of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' with the character [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]]. The species was named in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Rivals (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rivals]]".

El-Aurians appear outwardly identical to humans, and have a variety of ethnic types, with both dark- and light-skinned members of the race being shown on various ''Star Trek'' movies and television episodes. They can live well over 700 years. They are considered a race of listeners and often appear patient and wise.

[[El-Auria (Star Trek)|El-Auria]], the El-Aurian homeworld, was located in the [[Delta Quadrant]] and was destroyed by the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] in the mid-23rd century. Few survived, and those who did were scattered throughout the galaxy. Some of the refugees came to the [[United Federation of Planets]].&lt;ref&gt;Hastie, A.

{{details|Dominion (Star Trek)}}
The '''Jem'Hadar''' are characters in the TV series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', first introduced in the episode "[[The Jem'Hadar]]". They are the [[shock troops]] of the powerful [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] located in the [[Galactic quadrants (Star Trek)#Gamma Quadrant|Gamma Quadrant]]. Genetically engineered for strength and resolve, they are also short-lived and believe that "victory is life." They are bred to perceive the Founders, enigmatic [[shapeshifting|shape-shifters]] who rule the massive Dominion, as gods and are incapable of harming them. The Jem'Hadar's numbers are unknown, but they are produced by the thousands as needed.

Conceived as "more than just another fearsome alien", the ''Deep Space Nine'' makeup department searched for concepts depicting "toughness and resiliency" in the design of the Jem'Hadar. The final design was based on a [[rhinoceros]], with some added [[Ceratopsidae|ceratopian]] traits. Originally designed on the premise that they were all clones, the first Jem'Hadar seen onscreen were all made to look identical to one another, though as they became more deeply woven into the storylines, each Jem'Hadar was given a distinctive look.&lt;ref name="Westmore"&gt;{{cite book | author = Michael Westmore, Alan Sims, Bradley M.

===Kzinti===
A cat-like race introduced in ''Star Trek: The Animated Series''. Kzinti society is a male dominate race of warriors (they prefer to use the term "Heroes") led by the Patriarch. Kzinti Heros have much in common with Klingon warriors, in that they highly value courage, fighting prowess, and consider personal honor of highest priority. The one racial "flaw" that Kzinti have is overconfidence, which manifests itself in a tendency to attack before they are truly ready. This is because they believe that combat, with the removal of all challenge and risk (i.e. certain success), lessens the honor gained in battle.  Kzinti Heros place great pride in the scars they receive in battle, they also respect valiant and fierce opponents of other races, ensuring the bodies of these impressive alien warriors are stuffed and placed on honorable memorial display on Kzin, (the Kzinti home world).

Kzinti male are larger than their more docile females and humans They somewhat resemble a bipedal, barrel-chested, tiger-furred "tabby". Their tails are naked (rat like) and their ears have spines (resembling a section of a parasol.)

==O==

===Ocampa===
{{main|Kes (Star Trek)}}

A race native to the Delta Quadrant with a lifespan of only nine years.

Further characteristic:
Bone ears and various psychic mind abilities.

===Organian===
The '''Organians''' are [[Incorporeality|incorporeal]] energy creatures ("pure energy, pure thought") with no precise physical location in the universe. After the climax of the episode "[[Errand of Mercy]]", Spock comments that they are "as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the amoeba."  They assumed humanoid form to "interact" with the Federation representatives and the Klingons. They render all weapons belonging to the hostile parties inoperable through extreme heat, and then vanish.

The Organians were a race of beings who had evolved to a point of being pure conceptual beings, essence of thought with no corporeal bodies. In some ways they were similar to [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] for power levels and abilities. In the novel ''[[Q Strike]]'', the Organians appear to observe a battle between members of the Q Continuum and other seemingly omnipotent beings from the ''Star Trek'' universe. The original Q identifies them after being asked by Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] who they are, and is rather dismissive, remarking that "compared to their code of noninvolvement, your Prime Directive is practically an incitement to riot."

The Organians also appeared on ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' in the episode "[[Observer Effect (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Observer Effect]]," where they observed members of the crew infected with a silicon-based virus to decide whether or not they should make [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with humans. They did not technically appear onscreen; they only manifested themselves by possessing the bodies of several members of the ''[[NX-01 Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' crew.

===Orion===
{{main|Orion (Star Trek)}}
'''Orions''' are a green-skinned, humanoid alien species in the ''Star Trek'' universe.  An Orion was first portrayed as an illusion in the original ''Star Trek'' pilot, but wasn't seen in the broadcast series until this original pilot was incorporated into a two-part episode (episodes 11 and 12) in the first season.  Orions have also been portrayed in ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]''. [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]] played Orion [[Starfleet]] cadet Gaila in the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film.

The '''Pakled''' are a species of space-faring humanoids who obtain technology from other races (rather than developing it themselves), often through trickery.  They first appeared in the ''TNG'' episode "[[Samaritan Snare]]", where the Pakled ship ''Mondor'' feigned being in need of repairs.  After Chief Engineer [[Geordi La Forge]] transported to the ''Mondor'' and completed repairs, the Pakled captured him and demanded weapons technologies.  The Pakled do not appear again, but are mentioned in the ''TNG'' episode "[[Brothers (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Brothers]]" as the Pakleds inadvertently having rescued Data's brother [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]], who was beamed into open space at the end of "[[Datalore]]".

==T==

===Talaxian===
On ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', [[Neelix]] is a Talaxian.

===Tellarite===
The Tellarites first appeared in "[[Journey to Babel]]". (They have an odd facial appearance, represented by the actors wearing converted pig masks.) Culturally, they are known for their love of arguing and blunt, forceful speech, what most other cultures would consider rude; if Tellarite speech is answered in kind, they will typically consider it an honor.

=== Thasians ===
The Thasians are a psionically powerful, non-corporeal species, native to the planet Thasus. Until the 23rd century, the Federation had never encountered the Thasians and thus believed them to be a myth.  They appeared in "[[Charlie X]]" on the Original Series.

===Tholian===
The Tholians are an extremely xenophobic, non-humanoid hermaphroditic species with a propensity for precision. In Star Trek episode "[[The Tholian Web]]",Spock make the remark when fired upon by the Tholians: "The renowned Tholian punctuality". They first appear in the original series episode, "[[The Tholian Web]]". Tholian biology required high temperatures around 480 Kelvin (207&amp;nbsp;°C, 404&amp;nbsp;°F). They could tolerate lower temperatures for a brief period of time; if they were exposed to temperatures around 380 Kelvin or less, their carapace would crack. This was painful or distressing; a Tholian subjected to such a temperature regime could be coerced to cooperate. In temperatures even lower, a Tholian would freeze solid and shatter. (ENT: "Future Tense", "In a Mirror, Darkly")

===Tribble===
{{main|Tribble}}
Tribbles are a petlike species who hate Klingons. Two Star Trek TV shows featuring them are "[[The Trouble With Tribbles]]" (1967) and "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]" (1996).

===Trill===
{{main|Dax (Star Trek)}}
Humanoid species that are distinct in that they are a symbiotic species. The outward appearance is the host. The symbiont is revered and passes from host to host carrying all the memories, skills, and experiences of each prior host.

The Trill made their debut on television in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[The Host (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Host]]" (May 11, 1991), and were further developed as the species of successive main-cast characters of the television show ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' which made its debut on television with the two-part opener "[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]" (broadcast January 3, 1993). This species was also briefly represented as a holonovel character corresponding to Ensign Harry Kim on Voyager in "[[Author, Author (Star Trek: Voyager)|Author, Author]]" (April 18, 2001).

Trill have been studied in analysis of the biology of ''Star Trek'', especially in regards to the symbionts.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_SEgAGExTDcC&amp;q=Trill+Star+Trek&amp;dq=Trill+Star+Trek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX5YPsn9vaAhVM6IMKHUBBADYQ6AEIUzAH The biology of Star Trek -Susan C. Jenkins, Robert Jenkins 1998] (Page 89)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two contrasting concepts for Trill. One is that the symbiont is essentially an alien person,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SiuwCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75&amp;dq=Trill+stores+memories+star+trek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCu9verNvaAhUj8YMKHal2AVUQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Trill+stores+memories+star+trek&amp;f=false|title=Persons and Personal Identity|first=Amy|last=Kind|date=2 October 2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the joined Trill still mixes the original person with the memories and some of the personality of the symbiont.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Only a small percentage of trill use symbionts.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For joined trill the symbionts' memories and to some extent personalities are a synthesis with existing Trill's personality.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Joined trill have been studied in the philosophies of Star Trek, in particular whether a person is essentially the sum of their memories (the philosopher Locke's ''memory theory'').&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M0lfQWZL7EUC&amp;pg=PT167&amp;dq=Trill+stores+memories+star+trek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCu9verNvaAhUj8YMKHal2AVUQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Trill+stores+memories+star+trek&amp;f=false|title=Star Trek and Philosophy: The Wrath of Kant|first1=Jason T.|last1=Eberl|first2=Kevin S.|last2=Decker|date=30 April 2018|publisher=Open Court Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was explored in the ''Star Trek:Deep Space Nine'' television episode "[[Dax (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Dax]]".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; (see [[Personal_identity#Locke's_conception]])

The contrasting philosophy of the symbiont is called the ''functionalism'' according to ''Star Trek and Philosophy: The Wrath of Kant'', in which people are defined by their actions as opposed to memories.&lt;ReF&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M0lfQWZL7EUC&amp;pg=PT167&amp;dq=Trill+stores+memories+star+trek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCu9verNvaAhUj8YMKHal2AVUQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Trill%20stores%20memories%20star%20trek&amp;f=false Star Trek and Philosophy: The Wrath of Kant

[[Invasive species]] in the [[Everglades]] are [[Introduced species|exotic plants and animals]] that are not native to the area and have aggressively adapted to conditions in wilderness areas in southern [[Florida]]. The Everglades are a massive watershed in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Florida that drains overflow from the vast shallow [[Lake Okeechobee]] that is in turn fed by the [[Kissimmee River]]. The overflow forms a very shallow river about {{convert|60|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|100|mi|km}} long that travels about half a mile per day. The network of [[ecosystem]]s created by the Everglades are surrounded by urban areas to the east in the [[South Florida metropolitan area]], to the west by [[Naples, Florida|Naples]] and [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]], and to the south by [[Florida Bay]], a marine environment that receives fresh water from and is maintained by the Everglades. As it is surrounded on three sides and close to a major transportation and shipping center, it is particularly vulnerable to the importation of exotic species.

In the 20th century, Florida experienced a population surge unparalleled in the U.S., accompanied by rapid urban expansion made possible by [[Draining and development of the Everglades|draining portions of the Everglades]]. Flood control became a priority and the Central &amp; South Florida Flood Control Project, from 1947 to 1971, constructed over {{convert|1400|mi|km}} of canals and flood control structures in South Florida. The widespread building created new habitats and disturbed established plant and animal communities. Many of the new residents or tourists in Florida were responsible for introducing plant species to the area by accident, or deliberately to improve landscaping.  Many animals have been introduced similarly, and have either escaped or been released to proliferate on their own. Several terms are used to identify non-native species: exotic, invader, immigrant, colonist, introduced, nonindigenous, and naturalized. "Naturalized" usually refers to species that have adapted to a region over a long period of time,&lt;ref&gt;Simberloff, ''et al'', p. 5, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; while "invasive" refers to particularly destructive or aggressive species.&lt;ref name=lodge237/&gt;

Approximately 26%. of all fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the United States—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ferriter, ''et al'' (2004), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodriguez2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tommy Rodriguez|title=Visions of the Everglades: History Ecology Preservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMyGJ4m-5SwC&amp;pg=PA19|date=December 6, 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-0748-5|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the biological controls like weather, disease, and consumers that naturally limit plants in their native environments do not exist in the Everglades, causing many to grow larger and multiply far beyond their average numbers in their native habitats. Similarly, animals often do not find the predators or natural barriers to reproduction in the Everglades as they do where they originated, thus they often reproduce more quickly and efficiently. Concerns over the quality of the Everglades were raised in the beginning of the 20th century, and by  2000 a federally funded initiative was enacted that gave [[Restoration of the Everglades|Everglades restoration]] the distinction of being the largest planned environmental rehabilitation in history. Exotic species control falls under the management of the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]], which has been compiling and disseminating information about invasive species since 1994. Control of invasive species costs $500 million a year, but {{convert|1700000|acre|km2}} of land in South Florida remains infested.&lt;ref name=invaders&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/ever/naturescience/upload/2008%20Florida%20Invaders%20For%20Web.pdf Florida Invaders], National Park Service and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

== Plant species ==
As the fields of [[ecology]] and [[environmental studies]] develop, exotic species attract more attention and their effects become more apparent. Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune.&lt;ref&gt;Simberloff, ''et al'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life in South Florida was present but not particularly worthy of notice. Over the past decades, however, the number of exotic species and their spread has increased dramatically.&lt;ref name=lodge237&gt;Lodge, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Everglades hosts 1,301 species of native flora that are tropical or subtropical in nature, which arrived on the Florida peninsula about 5,000 years ago. Winds, water, and birds carried most of the tropical flora. The subtropical species spread from more northern locations.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010 1,392 additional non-native plant species have been identified and established themselves in South Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, ''et al'', p. 9-2.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of avenues are available for species to be brought by humans deliberately or by accident: agricultural experiments, in shipping containers, or attached to vehicles. South Florida is a transportation hub for shipping and traffic between the U.S. and the Caribbean and Central and South America. In 1990, 333 million plants were brought into [[Miami International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;Ugarte, Cristina (1998).

State, local, and federal government agencies spend millions of dollars to rid South Florida of invasive species and prevent more from entering the region. Plants that are imported to Florida are subject to classification as "Restricted" or "Prohibited", but a new designation is being considered "Not Authorized Pending Plant Risk Analysis", to allow scientists to assess what damage exotic plants may cause to the South Florida environment.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, ''et al'', p. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt; A nonproft organization named The Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council lists exotic species as belonging in Category I: "altering native plant communities by displacing native species, changing community structures or ecological functions, or hybridizing with natives"; and Category II: "increased in abundance or frequency but have not yet altered Florida plant communities to the extent shown by Category I".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fleppc.org/list/list.htm Plant Lists], Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council Invasive (2009). Retrieved on February 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 species have been placed in Category I, but a few have been singled out for the potential to cause the most destruction based on how rapidly they reproduce, their displacement of native flora by crowding, shading, or fire, excellent adaptations to conditions in the Everglades, and the potential to spread (or evidence that they have spread) into remote areas of the Everglades.&lt;ref name=Ferriter11&gt;Ferriter, ''et al'' (2004), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

| colspan=3 | Melaleuca tree seeds were scattered by aircraft in order to drain flooded portions of the Everglades. They were considered excellent landscaping trees as late as 1970 and planted along canals to stabilize soil or act as windbreaks. They grow significantly taller than where they originate, very densely—not allowing wading birds with large wingspans to fly between—and very rapidly. They are very tolerant of fire and flooded conditions. One tree is capable of producing 20 million seeds year-round. Authorities are attempting to limit the spread of Melaleuca by quarantining stands of trees, felling established ones, and applying herbicide. They are also releasing the melaleuca psyllid (''[[Boreioglycaspis melaleucae]]''),  and melaleuca snout weevil (''[[Oxyops vitiosa]]'') that can kill seedlings, that has resulted in the reduction of 85% of melaleuca growth in some places over the past ten years, allowing four times the plant diversity in these locations. Melaleuca control is considered a major accomplishment by the South Florida Water Management District: between 1993 and 2008, the estimated acreage of melaleuca has decreased from {{convert|500000|acre|km2}} to {{convert|273000|acre|km2}}&lt;ref&gt;Ferriter, ''et al'' (2004), p. 11, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp. 240–241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, p. 9-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that it fatally traps medium- and large-sized animals such as deer and turtles. While fire may burn some of the Old World climbing fern, portions of burning fern may break loose and spread fires more quickly. "Fire ladders" are created when ferns grow into the [[Canopy (biology)|forest canopy]], above the line that cypress and other trees naturally tolerate fire damage. The thick [[rachis]] fern mats may also trap animals attempting to flee fires. There is no definitive plan to rid ecologically sensitive areas in South Florida of this exotic plant, although herbicides and controlled fires are being explored. Biological agents such as brown lygodium moth (''[[Neomusotima conspurcatalis]]'') and leaf-gall mite (''[[Floracarus perrepae]]''), that feed on and destroy parts of the climbing ferns, were released in 2008, and their overall effects are under evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Ferriter, ''et al'' (2004), pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Jeffrey.

They were planted as windbreaks along canals and agricultural fields, and as shade trees in the middle of the 20th century. They are salt tolerant and grow well in beach areas, displacing native vegetation that prevents coastal erosion, particularly following disturbances like tropical storms. The native habitat of the endangered Cape Sable seaside sparrow (''[[Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis]]'') is directly threatened by the Australian pine. Native seedlings are discouraged by the shade given by Australian pines and furthermore smothered by the dense litter shed by the trees. The Australian pine's shallow roots can disrupt beach nesting animals such as sea turtles and American crocodiles (''[[Crocodylus acutus]]''). Herbicides are effective in removing Australian pines.

== Animal species ==

Although the general effects of invasive animals is not as profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and a constant reminder of the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, to the surprise of all.&lt;ref name="Lodge, p. 244"&gt;Lodge, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 12,500 species of insects are native to Florida, most of which naturally flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 have been identified as exotic.&lt;ref&gt;Simberloff, ''et al'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Insects create about $1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (''[[Gromphadorhina portentosa]]'') and European cricket (''[[Acheta domesticus]]'') are sold as pets or fishing bait, and are then released into backyards.&lt;ref&gt;Simberloff, ''et al'', p. 97–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with exotic species which are dumped or escape into waterways.&lt;ref&gt;Simberloff, ''et al'', pp. 101–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excluding insects and other arthropods, 192 exotic animal species have established themselves in Florida as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Ferriter, ''et al'' (2009), p. 9-2.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 50 species of fish have been introduced. Early recorded species were the pike killifish (''[[Belonesox belizanus]]'') and oscar (''[[Astronotus ocellatus]]''). The extensive network of canals throughout South Florida allows many species to disperse more readily than they would under natural conditions as many regions in the Everglades go dry each year or experience extended drought periods. The overall impact of exotic fishes on the native populations and habitats is largely unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trexler | first1 = Joel | last2 = Loftus | first2 = William F. | last3 = Jordan | first3 = Frank | last4 = Lorenz | first4 = Jerome J. | last5 = Chick | first5 = John H. | year = 2000 | title = Empirical assessment of fish introductions in a subtropical wetland: an evaluation of contrasting views | url = | journal = Biological Invasions | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 265–277 | doi=10.1023/a:1011488118444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida also began requiring owners to pay a permit fee of $100 a year and place [[Microchip implant (animal)|microchips]] on the animals. These predators are included on the list for their formidable size and aggressive natures; animals that were in the Everglades before the list was created, however, are breeding in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;Ferriter, ''et al'' (2009), p. 9-3.&lt;/ref&gt; To combat the number of exotic snakes in the U.S., and specifically in South Florida, the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] added four species of snakes—Burmese pythons, two subspecies of African rock pythons (northern and southern), and the yellow anaconda (''[[Eunectes notaeus]]'')—to [[Lacey Act]] provisions, making their import into the U.S. illegal, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Kim (January 17, 2012).

| colspan=3 | This member of the ''[[Dryophthoridae]]'' family causes specific damage to [[bromeliad]]s, which are ecosystems unto themselves as the water they hold feeds a host of smaller amphibians and insects. Fifteen species of bromeliads grow naturally throughout the Everglades, and they are also used as ornamental landscaping in residential areas.

They have become established in [[Big Cypress National Preserve]], [[Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge]], and [[Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park]]. Adults lay eggs in bromeliad stems and larvae pupate in the stems, possibly causing the plants to detach from their host trees. Adults also feed on the leaves of bromeliads. Not all species of bromeliads are affected by the beetle, but ten are, particularly ''[[Tillandsia utriculata]]'' and ''[[Tillandsia fasciculata]]'', that have been devastated and listed as endangered species because of the infestation.

| colspan=3 | Domesticated free-ranging and feral cats are the primary cause of bird deaths in the U.S. Although cats may be regularly fed, they have an instinct to hunt and are responsible for decreasing numbers of beach mice (''[[Peromyscus polionotus]]''), cotton mice (''[[Peromyscus gossypinus]]''), the endangered Lower Keys marsh rabbit (''[[Sylvilagus palustris hefneri]]''), scrub jays (''[[Aphelocoma coerulescens]]''), ground-nesting birds and sea turtle hatchlings. They may carry diseases that can be spread to [[Lynx rufus|bobcats]] and the [[Florida panther]], including [[feline leukemia]], [[feline panleukopenia]], and [[rabies]]. Cats reproduce prodigiously; there are an estimated 5.3 million free-ranging cats in Florida. Most live in feral colonies or are closely associated with residential areas. In similar sized territories cats potentially outnumber bobcats 640:1. Authorities address feral cats by urging pet owners to keep cats indoors, or trapping-neutering-and returning (TNR) them to their territories to live out their lives and die naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feral Cat Issue Team (March 3, 2003).

An '''off-season Atlantic hurricane''' is a recorded [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|tropical]] or [[subtropical cyclone]] that existed in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic basin]] outside of the official Atlantic hurricane season. The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] currently defines the season as occurring between June 1 and November 30 each calendar year, which is when 97% of all Atlantic tropical cyclones occur. Peak activity is known to be between August and October. In the off-season, storms are most likely to occur in May, with approximately 60% of such storms occurring during that month. Occasionally, however, storms develop in or persist until December. As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been 89 off-season cyclones in the [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|Atlantic hurricane database]], which began in [[1851 Atlantic hurricane season|1851]]. In addition, there were six storms before 1851, and one hurricane in 1863 that is not part of the official database.

Off-season cyclones are most likely to occur in the central to western Atlantic Ocean, and most do not make [[landfall]]. Of the storms that did strike land, most affected areas surrounding the Caribbean Sea. Cumulatively, at least 441&amp;nbsp;deaths occurred due to the storms, primarily on the islands of [[Hispaniola]] and [[Cuba]]; a [[1948 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm One|tropical storm in May 1948]] struck the [[Dominican Republic]] to become the deadliest off-season storm. However, an unofficial hurricane in 1863 killed 110&amp;nbsp;people, in a shipwreck off Florida and on land. The same storm was estimated to have reached winds of 105&amp;nbsp;mph (165&amp;nbsp;km/h), making it the strongest hurricane between December to May; the strongest currently in the official database was a March hurricane in 1908 that reached winds of 100&amp;nbsp;mph (160&amp;nbsp;km/h). In addition, the strongest off-season cyclone to make landfall in the United States was [[Tropical Storm Beryl (2012)|Tropical Storm Beryl]] in [[2012 Atlantic hurricane season|2012]], which made landfall near [[Jacksonville Beach, Florida]] with 65&amp;nbsp;mph (100&amp;nbsp;km/h) winds.&lt;ref name="Beryl"&gt;{{cite report|author=Beven II, John L|title=Tropical storm Beryl|type=Tropical Cyclone Report|date=December 12, 2012|author2=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=December 14, 2012|url={{NHC TCR url|id=AL022012_Beryl}}|format=PDF|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent off-season storm is [[Tropical Storm Alberto (2018)|Tropical Storm Alberto]] in May 2018.

==Background==
In 1938, the [[United States Weather Bureau]] began issuing [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical cyclone warnings]] as a collaborative observation network for cities along the U.S. coastline, and the season was defined between June 15 and November 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer|page=14|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=1938-06-15|title=Hurricane Warning Service Expanded|accessdate=2010-02-28|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2pwLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wFQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4682,4528700&amp;dq=weather+bureau+hurricane+season&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the season was extended to begin on June 1 and end on November 30,&lt;ref name="upi"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer|agency=United Press International|page=2|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=1964-06-01|title=Annual Man Against Nature Battle Opens This Morning|accessdate=2010-02-28|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j9oeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vmUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5887,11176&amp;dq=hurricane+season&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which remains the official length of the season. About 97% of all tropical cyclones form within this time span, and activity usually peaks between August and October.&lt;ref name="season"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dorst, Neil|author2=Hurricane Research Division|author3=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|year=2012|title=Subject: G1&amp;nbsp;– When is hurricane season?|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research|accessdate=2010-03-02|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Tropical Storm Ana (2015)|Tropical Storm Ana]] formed in May 2015, former [[American Meteorological Society]] president Marshall Shepherd used [[Twitter]] to question whether the season should begin earlier. [[James Franklin (meteorologist)|James Franklin]] of the [[National Hurricane Center]] believed there was little advantage to changing it because of the rarity of off-season storms, noting that May storms only formed on average once every six years since the advent of satellite imagery. Franklin opined that the season could begin on May&amp;nbsp;15 with little difficulty, coinciding with the beginning of the [[Pacific hurricane season]], but an earlier start would be costlier and interfere with off-season work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Samenow|title=Hurricane Center: May storms don’t mean hurricane season should start earlier|date=May 12, 2015|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=May 14, 2015|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/05/12/hurricane-center-may-storms-dont-mean-hurricane-season-should-start-earlier/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
Tropical cyclones have been named in the Atlantic since the [[1947 Atlantic hurricane season]], and subtropical cyclones have been recognized in [[HURDAT]] since 1968. The National Hurricane Center issues names for tropical and subtropical cyclones once their winds reach 39&amp;nbsp;mph (63&amp;nbsp;km/h). Before 1950, storms are numbered based on their appearance in the Atlantic hurricane database, although tropical depressions are unnumbered.&lt;ref name="HURDAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="META"&gt;{{cite report|author=Hurricane Research Division|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research|author2=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|title=Documentation of Atlantic Tropical Cyclones Changes in HURDAT|accessdate=May 14, 2015|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/metadata_master.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ATL Book"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Colin J.

The wind speeds listed are [[Maximum sustained wind|maximum one-minute average sustained winds]], and the pressure is the minimum [[barometric pressure]]; tropical cyclones listed with N/A under pressure indicates there is no known estimated pressure. For deaths, "None" indicates that there were no reports of fatalities; death tolls listed as "several" mean there were fatalities reported, but an exact total is unavailable. For both deaths and damage, N/A refers to no known total, although such storms may have impacted land. The damage totals are the [[United States dollar]] of the year of the storm.

==Records and statistics==
[[Image:TS Odette.jpg|right|thumb|[[Tropical Storm Odette (2003)|Tropical Storm Odette]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]] in December 2003|alt=Satellite image of a developing Tropical storm in the central Caribbean Sea. Clouds extend northeast toward Hispaniola and southeast toward northern South America.]]
In the official Atlantic hurricane database, which dates back to 1851, the first storm to occur outside of the current season was in 1865 in the Caribbean Sea. In the database, 83 [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] or [[subtropical cyclone]]s have existed between December and May, most recently [[2018 Atlantic hurricane season#Subropical Storm Alberto|Subtropical Storm Alberto]] in 2018.&lt;ref name="HURDAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="META"/&gt; In addition, there were at least five storms in May and another in December before the start of the official database.&lt;ref name="chenoweth"/&gt;

Storms were most likely to occur in May, followed by December. Out of all recorded storms in the database, only one cyclone was reported in the month of March; the [[1908 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane One|1908 March hurricane]], as well as one tropical storm in February, which was the [[1952 Groundhog Day Storm]]. In addition, only three tropical or subtropical cyclones formed in April &amp;ndash; a [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season#Subtropical Storm One|subtropical storm in 1992]], [[Tropical Storm Ana (2003)|Tropical Storm Ana]] of 2003, and [[2017 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Arlene|Tropical Storm Arlene]] of 2017. A [[1938 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane One|hurricane in 1938]], a [[1951 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm One|tropical storm in 1951]], a [[1978 Atlantic hurricane season#Subtropical Storm One|subtropical storm in 1978]], and [[Hurricane Alex (2016)|Hurricane Alex]] of 2016 occurred in January. Of all cyclones during the off-season, [[Hurricane Lili (1984)|Hurricane Lili]] in 1984 lasted the longest, for a total of 12&amp;nbsp;days. [[Hurricane Epsilon]], which formed in November, maintained hurricane status for five days in December 2005, longer than any other storm in December; the previous record was two and a half days, set by Hurricane Lili in 1984. Additionally, [[Hurricane Alice (December 1954)|Hurricane Alice]] in 1954–1955 and [[Tropical Storm Zeta]] in 2005–2006 were the only recorded cyclones to have spanned two calendar years.&lt;ref name="HURDAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="META"/&gt;

Of the off-season storms that struck land, portions of the [[Caribbean]] were affected most.&lt;ref name="HURDAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="META"/&gt; Hurricane Alice was the only of the cyclones to strike land as a hurricane, doing so to islands in the northern [[Lesser Antilles]]; it caused locally heavy rainfall and moderate damage.&lt;ref name="1955mwr"/&gt; No hurricanes have ever made landfall in the United States during December, although at one point a storm in 1925 was believed to have done this.&lt;ref name="HURDAT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author4=National Hurricane Center |author=Blake, Eric S |author2=Landsea, Christopher W |author3=Gibney, Ethan J |archivedate=November 27, 2012 |deadurl=no |date=August 2011 |title=The Deadliest, Costliest, and Most Intense United States Tropical Cyclones from 1851 to 2010 (And Other Frequently Requested Hurricane Facts) |type=NOAA Technical Memorandum NWS NHC-6 |accessdate=November 27, 2012 |publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service |url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/nws-nhc-6.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CUXzlU54?url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/nws-nhc-6.pdf |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One century earlier, a hurricane formed in the western Caribbean and struck Florida on or before June&amp;nbsp;3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sandrik, Al|publisher=Florida State University|title=The Early June Hurricane of 1825&amp;nbsp;– I&amp;nbsp;– June 2–4|url=http://mailer.fsu.edu/~jelsner/HHITProject/HHITyears/1825/storm1_pt1_other.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615074755/http://mailer.fsu.edu/~jelsner/HHITProject/HHITyears/1825/storm1_pt1_other.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the earliest date for a United States hurricane landfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sugg, Arnold|date=1966-06-24|title=Alma (Preliminary)|author2=National Hurricane Center|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|accessdate=2010-12-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1966-prelim/alma/prelim02.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is an unofficial hurricane in 1863 that struck the Florida panhandle, killing 110&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name="amanda"/&gt; The deadliest official off-season storm was a tropical storm in May 1948, which killed 80&amp;nbsp;people in the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="deadliest"/&gt;

The year with the most off-season storms was [[1887 Atlantic hurricane season|1887]], with a total of five existing in the off-season. The [[1951 Atlantic hurricane season|1951]] season had four, one of which a depression. Several others had three tropical cyclones, of which only [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season|2003]] had three tropical storms. The [[1908 Atlantic hurricane season|1908]] and 1951 seasons were the only ones with two hurricanes forming in the off-season. In seven seasons, there were storms both prior to the start of the season as well as after the season ended, those being 1887, [[1911 Atlantic hurricane season|1911]], 1951, [[1953 Atlantic hurricane season|1953]], 1954, 2003, and [[2007 Atlantic hurricane season|2007]]; all but 1911 had tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm status before and after the season.&lt;ref name="HURDAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="META"/&gt;

[[File:Beni Department aérea 25.jpg|thumb|250px|Llanos de Moxos]]
The '''Llanos de Moxos''', also known as the '''Beni savanna''' or the '''Moxos plains''', is a [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical savanna]] [[ecoregion]] of northern [[Bolivia]].

==Setting==
The Llanos de Moxos covers an area of {{convert|126,100|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} in the lowlands of northern Bolivia, with small portions in neighboring [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]]. Most of the Llanos de Moxos lies within the departments of [[El Beni Department|El Beni]], [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]], [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|La Paz]], [[Pando Department|Pando]], and [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]]. The Llanos de Moxos occupies the southwestern corner of the [[Amazon basin]], and the region is crossed by numerous rivers that drain the eastern slope of the [[Andes Mountains]]. The low relief of the savannas, coupled with wet season rains and snowmelt from the Andes, cause up to half the land to flood seasonally.

The Llanos de Moxos is surrounded by [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forests]]; the [[Southwestern Amazonian moist forests]] to the north, west, and south, and the [[Madeira-Tapajós moist forests]] to the east.

===Climate===
The climate of the Llanos de Moxos is tropical, with pronounced wet and dry seasons. The wet season generally extends from December to May, and annual rainfall ranges from 1300 in the east to 2000&amp;nbsp;mm in the west.

==Flora==
The ecoregion comprises a mosaic of savannas and wetlands, with islands of forest and gallery forests along rivers. Flooding and fire are important ecological factors.

==Fauna==
The Llanos de Moxos is home to the [[blue-throated macaw]] (''Ara glaucogularis''), which is [[critically endangered]].

==People==
{{main|Llanos de Moxos (archaeology)}}
The Llanos de Moxos was the setting for many complex [[pre-Columbian]] societies, many of which constructed [[agriculture|agricultural]] earthworks such as raised fields, [[causeway]]s, [[canal]]s and mounds. These earthworks were built and used from about 1100 BC until about AD 1450, so far as can be told from archeological remains which do not preserve well in the tropics. The earthworks exceed the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza pyramids]] in size and arouse similar speculation as to the means by which they were constructed. Prehispanic peoples made decorated [[pottery]], wove cotton cloth, and in some places buried their dead in large urns.

A 50,000 square kilometer swath of savanna has been identified as having raised fields which were used for agriculture from about 1100 BC until AD 1450.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mann|first=Charles C.|date=2008-09-29|title=Ancient Earthmovers of the Amazon|journal=Science|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|volume=321|issue=5893|pages=1150|pmid=18755950|doi=10.1126/science.321.5893.1148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[European ethnic groups|European]]s arrived in the [[Americas]] in the late 15th century, they did not come to settle in the Llanos de Moxos until the late 17th century. The missions established by [[Jesuit]] missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries became many of the modern towns in the region.

Since the 1950s, [[ranching]] has become the most important form of [[agriculture]], and ranches dominate the landscape.

==General==
The term ''marine ice sheet'' describes an ice sheet whose base rests on ground below sea level, and ''marine ice sheet instability'' describes the inherent precarious nature of marine ice sheets due to [[Archimedes' principle]]. Because seawater is denser than ice, marine ice sheets can only remain stable where the ice is thick enough for its mass to exceed the mass of the seawater displaced by the ice. In other words, wherever ice exists below sea level, it is held in place only by the weight of overlying ice. As a marine ice sheet melts, the weight of the overlying ice decreases. If melt causes thinning beyond a critical threshold, the [[subaerial]] ice may no longer be heavy enough to prevent the submarine ice below it from lifting off the ground and floating away.

The location of grounding line, the boundary between the ice sheet and the floating ice shelves, is unstable in this case. The amount of ice flowing though the grounding line initially matches the accumulation of ice upstream. When the grounding line is pushed backwards, due to for instance melt by warm water, the ice sheet is more thick at the new location of the grounding line and total ice flowing through increases. As this leads the ice sheet to lose mass, the grounding line is pushed back even further and this [[Positive feedback|self-reinforcing mechanism]] is the cause of the instability. Ice sheets of this type have accelerated ice sheet retreat.&lt;ref name="Pollard2015"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature|volume=412|pages=112–121|year=2015|title=Potential Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat driven by hydrofracturing and ice cliff failure|authors=Pollard et al.|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X14007961|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2014.12.035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/cr/2016/06/22/marine-ice-sheet-instability-for-dummies-2/|title=Marine Ice Sheet Instability "For Dummies"|work=EGU|year=2016|author=David Docquier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking the MISI theory is only valid if the ice shelves are free floating and not constrained in an [[Bay|embayment]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The initial perturbation or push-back of the grounding line might be caused by high water temperatures at the base of [[ice shelves]] so that melt increases (basal melt). The thinned ice shelves which stabilize the ice sheet, exert less of an buttressing effect (back stress).&lt;ref name="Pollard2015" /&gt;

=== Marine Ice Cliff Instability ===
A related process known as ''Marine Ice Cliff Instability'' (MICI) posits that due to the physical characteristics of ice, [[subaerial]] ice cliffs exceeding ~90 meters in height are likely to collapse under their own weight, and could lead to runaway ice sheet retreat in a fashion similar to MISI.&lt;ref name="Pollard2015" /&gt; For an ice sheet grounded below sea level with an inland-sloping bed, ice cliff failure removes peripheral ice, which then exposes taller, more unstable ice cliffs, further perpetuating the cycle of ice front failure and retreat. Surface melt can further enhance MICI through ponding and [[Hydro-fracturing (Ice sheet)|hydrofracture]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattyn|first=Frank|date=2018|title=The paradigm shift in Antarctic ice sheet modelling|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05003-z|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=9|issue=1|pages=2728|doi=10.1038/s41467-018-05003-z|pmid=30013142|pmc=6048022|issn=2041-1723|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dow|first=Christine F.|last2=Lee|first2=Won Sang|last3=Greenbaum|first3=Jamin S.|last4=Greene|first4=Chad A.|last5=Blankenship|first5=Donald D.|last6=Poinar|first6=Kristin|last7=Forrest|first7=Alexander L.|last8=Young|first8=Duncan A.|last9=Zappa|first9=Christopher J.|date=2018-06-01|title=Basal channels drive active surface hydrology and transverse ice shelf fracture|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaao7212|journal=Science Advances|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|pages=eaao7212|doi=10.1126/sciadv.aao7212|issn=2375-2548|pmc=6007161|pmid=29928691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ocean warming==
[[File:Schematic-of-stratification-and-precipitation-amplifying-feedbacks.jpg|thumb|Schematic of stratification and precipitation amplifying feedbacks. Stratification: increased freshwater flux reduces surface water density, thus reducing AABW formation, trapping NADW heat, and increasing ice shelf melt. Precipitation: increased freshwater flux cools ocean mixed layer, increases sea ice area, causing precipitation to fall before it reaches Antarctica, reducing ice sheet growth and increasing ocean surface freshening. Ice in West Antarctica and the Wilkes Basin, East Antarctica, is most vulnerable because of the instability of retrograde beds.]]
According to a 2016 published study, cold meltwater provides cooling of the ocean's surface layer, acting like a lid, and also affecting deeper waters by increasing subsurface ocean warming and thus facilitating ice melt.

Another theory discussed in 2007 for increasing warm bottom water is that that changes in air circulation patterns have led to increased upwelling of warm, deep ocean water along the coast of Antarctica and that this warm water has increased melting of floating ice shelves.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2007/05/statement-thinning-of-west-antarctic-ice-sheet-demands-improved-monitoring-to-reduce-uncertainty-over-potential-sea-level-rise/|title=Statement: Thinning of West Antarctic Ice Sheet Demands Improved Monitoring to Reduce Uncertainty over Potential Sea-Level Rise|website=Jsg.utexas.edu|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ocean model has shown how changes in winds can help channel the water along deep troughs on the sea floor, toward the ice shelves of outlet glaciers.&lt;ref name="ThomaJenkins2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2008GL034939| last1 = Thoma | first1 = M.| last2 = Jenkins | first2 = A.| last3 = Holland | first3 = D.| last4 = Jacobs | first4 = S.| year = 2008| title = Modelling Circumpolar Deep Water intrusions on the Amundsen Sea continental shelf, Antarctica| journal = [[Geophysical Research Letters]]| volume = 35| issue = 18| page = L18602| pmid = | pmc = | bibcode = 2008GeoRL..3518602T| url = http://epic.awi.de/25479/1/2008_Modelling_Circumpolar_Deep_Water_intrusions_on_the_Amundsen_Sea_continental_shelf_Antarctica.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name '''Materials Genome''' was coined in December 2002 by Dr. Zi-Kui Liu who incorporated the company "MaterialsGenome, Inc." in Pennsylvania, USA,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.materialsgenome.com&lt;/ref&gt; and filed the trademark protection on March 5, 2004 (78512752). The Certificate of Registration (Reg. No. 4,224,035) was issued by the Patent and Trademark office on October 16, 2012.

==History==
In 2005, Dr. Zi-Kui Liu and Dr. Pierre Villars jointly crafted a proposal on "Materials Genome Foundation" when they met in Switzerland. In January 2006, they presented the proposal to a panel organized by ASM International.

In 2008, United States Automotive Materials Partnership (USAMP) supported by Department of Energy funded a smaller version of the concept of "Materials Genome Foundation", which resulted in the development of the software package ESPEI.

In June 2011, the name "Materials Genome" was used in the White House "Materials Genome Initiative" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/mgi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420114542/https://www.whitehouse.gov/mgi |archivedate=2016-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mgi.gov&lt;/ref&gt; in consent with MaterialsGenome, Inc.

In 2014, Dr. Liu published an article to reflect "Perspective on Materials Genome" in English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Zi-Kui | year = 2014 | title = Perspective on Materials Genome® | doi = 10.1007/s11434-013-0072-x | journal = Chin. Sci. Bull. | volume = 59| issue = 15| pages = 1619–1623| bibcode = 2014ChSBu..59.1619L}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Chinese &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Zi-Kui | year = 2013 | title = Perspective on Materials Genome® | url = http://csb.scichina.com:8080/CN/Y2013/V58/I35/3618 | journal = Chin. Sci. Bull. | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 3618–3622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, Chenxi Qian, [[Todd Siler|Dr. Todd Siler]] and Dr. Geoffrey A. Ozin jointly published a paper in ''Small'', discussing about the possibilities and limitations of a Nanomaterials Genome, expanding concept of the Materials Genome by incorporating the important parameters of nanometerials such as size and shape information into the roadmap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qian|first=Chenxi|last2=Siler|first2=Todd|last3=Ozin|first3=Geoffrey A.|date=2015-01-01|title=Exploring the Possibilities and Limitations of a Nanomaterials Genome|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.201402197/abstract|journal=Small|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=64–69|doi=10.1002/smll.201402197|issn=1613-6829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, a group scientist led by Sorelle A. Friedler, Joshua Schrier and Alexander J. Norquist claimed the first machine-learning-assisted materials discovery, as an example of human's early attempts to design and materials via data-driven approaches proposed by the Materials Genome Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raccuglia|first=Paul|last2=Elbert|first2=Katherine C.|last3=Adler|first3=Philip D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1370">'''Naturhistorieselskabet''' - the Society for Natural History - was a private society that was the only institution to offer education in [[natural history]] in [[Denmark]] in the late 18th century. The spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and an escalating [[agriculture|agricultural]] crisis, led the [[List of Danish monarchs|king]] and the [[Denmark|Danish]] elite to call foreign experts on [[economy]], including [[botany]] and [[silviculture]], to the country. The autonomous [[University of Copenhagen]], on the other hand, was reluctant to employ foreign experts in little-established disciplines. Naturhistorieselskabet was formed in 1788 in order to ensure education in [[botany]], [[zoology]] and [[mineralogy]] based on private funds. For example, [[Martin Vahl]] lectured in [[botany]]. After the appointment in 1795 of a professor in [[geology]] and in 1797 one in [[botany]], the society gradually lost its importance. It was soon abolished and its collections donated to the state (much later united with the university collections).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15224">'''Net metering in New Mexico''' is a set of state public policies that govern the relationship between solar customers (and customers with other types of renewable energy systems) and electric utility companies.

== Background ==
{{Main|Net metering}}
=== Definition ===
Net metering refers to the interconnection of a renewable energy system to the power grid. It allows consumers who have their own renewable generation power systems to connect to the power grid with an electric meter that spins both forwards and backwards, depending on whether the consumer is adding energy to the grid or using energy from the grid. At the end of the month, the customer’s bill is based on the net amount of power that is drawn from the grid, minus the credits for excess power put into the grid.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmsea.org/Interconnection.php|title=NMSEA - New Mexico Solar Energy Association|website=www.nmsea.org|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Mexico, customers who have systems that produce up to 80 MW of electricity are able to sign up for net metering. This is the highest power rating eligible for net metering in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cleanenergyauthority.com/solar-rebates-and-incentives/new-mexico/new-mexico-net-metering/|title=New Mexico Net Metering|work=The Clean Energy Authority|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three main utilities in New Mexico are PNM, Xcel Energy and El Paso Electric.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Benefits of net metering ===
One benefit of net metering is that power is never wasted. When someone uses an isolated system that uses batteries that become fully charged while the system is still generating power, that excess power is wasted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Customer-generators, businesses and industrial operations can qualify for net metering. Customer-generators have the added benefit of selling renewable energy credits (REC) back to their utility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (A customer-generator is a small producer--that is not an electric utility--of electricity which is net metered and connected to the electric grid. An example would be a homeowner who puts solar panels on his rooftop.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.puc.state.pa.us/general/consumer_ed/pdf/Home_Alt_Energy_FS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;)

=== Utility-scale solar vs. residential solar ===
A utility-scale solar facility is a large facility that generates solar power and moves that power into the electric grid. Almost every utility-scale solar facility has what is known as a power purchase agreement with the utility. The agreement guarantees a market for the utility-scale solar facility’s energy for a fixed term of time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/what-does-utility-scale-solar-really-mean|title=What Does ‘Utility-Scale Solar’ Really Mean?|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Residential solar systems are not considered utility-scale).

The size of a utility-scale facility can vary. For example, some utility-scale facilities provide only enough power per megawatt to power a few hundred average homes. Others offer a lot more energy. Factors that play into this are location, the type of technology used, and the availability of sunlight.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/818093/nms-solar-industry-finally-hitting-its-stride.html|title=Updated: NM's solar industry shining brighter|last=Robinson-Avila|first=Kevin|date=2016-08-01|website=Albuquerque Journal|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, although not located in New Mexico, Recurrent Energies’ “Sunset Reservoir” project in San Francisco produces 5 megawatts of solar energy. It is built on top of enclosed reservoir in the middle of San Francisco. It is considered a utility-scale solar facility.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== How it works ==

=== Net excess generation ===
For customers with solar systems that can generate 10 kilowatts or less, the utility company has a choice in how they compensate that customer for net excess generation. The utility can give the customer a credit on their next bill equal to the utility’s energy rate (the costs that the utility pays for its own electricity), or crediting the customer for the kilowatt hours of electricity that they have supplied back to utility through the grid.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/284|title=DSIRE|website=programs.dsireusa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technical ===
In New Mexico, a few technical requirements exist in order for a net metering system to be connected to the grid. First, the net metering system should have a visible means of disconnection allowing the utility to disconnect to system from the grid. Second, a net meter is required and should cost no more than $20. Third, there needs to be an inverter that disconnects when the grid goes down.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The system capacity limit is 80 megawatts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Eligibility ===
In New Mexico the types of renewable technologies eligible for net metering are the following:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Combined Heat &amp; Power
* [[Fuel cell]]s using Non-Renewable Fuels
* Fuel cells using Renewable Fuels
* Geothermal Electric
* [[Hydroelectric]]
* Hydroelectric (Small)
* [[Landfill gas]]
* [[Microturbine]]s
* [[Municipal solid waste]]
* Solar [[photovoltaics]]
* Solar thermal electric
* Wind (All), [[Biomass]]
* Wind (Small)

Sectors that can use net metering include commercial, industrial, local government, nonprofits, residential homes, schools, state and federal government, agricultural, and institutional.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The types of utilities that can participate in net metering are investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Utilities that can participate are investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives. When a customer leaves the utility, the utility must pay the customer for any unused credits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Availability and jurisdiction ===
According to DSIRE, “Net metering is available to all "qualifying facilities" (QFs), as defined by the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), which pertains to renewable energy systems and combined heat and power systems up to 80 megawatts (MW) in capacity. There is no statewide cap on the aggregate capacity of net-metered systems.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Additionally, all utilities that are subject regulation under the Public Regulation Commission’s (PRC) jurisdiction must offer net metering. Municipal utilities, which are not regulated by the PRC, are exempt.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Solar in New Mexico ==

=== Growth ===
In New Mexico, the decrease in prices for solar systems is driving the market for it. Many homeowners and commercial companies are purchasing solar systems to help offset the increase in electric utility bills. More financing options are available today in New Mexico, more solar companies are competing, and this is leading to an increase in market penetration.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The growth is predicted at 20% per year. As of early 2016, the market in the United States for solar systems had reached 1 million solar installations. This is equivalent to generating enough electricity to power 5.4 million homes, according to the national Solar Energy Industry Association.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to the ''Albuquerque Journal'', “New Mexico ranks 8th in the nation today in terms of installed solar capacity per capita.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is estimated that the solar market in New Mexico has only experienced approximately 10% of market penetration.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Solar capacity and statistics ===
According to the ''Albuquerque Journal'', “As of year-end 2015, New Mexico had about 400 megawatts of installed capacity. That includes 85 MW of residential and commercial systems, and 316 MW of utility-scale generation scattered throughout the service territories of New Mexico’s public utilities and electric cooperatives.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

For all the installed solar capacity in the New Mexico, the Public Service Company of New Mexico accounts for around 41% of that. Their facilities include 15 different projects with a total of 107 MW of capacity, which according to the company, provides enough power 140,000 average homes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

New Mexico requires public utilities to get 15% of their electric generation from renewable sources. That number will increase to 20% by the year 2020.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Within the state, 60 different contracting and installation companies operate. These firms include national companies like [[SolarCity]] and ZingSolar.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Consumer incentives ==

=== State tax credit ===
Up until the end of 2016, New Mexico offered a 10% state [[tax credit]] for solar installations. The tax credit began in 2008.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Solar companies operating in New Mexico say they are okay to absorb the loss of the state tax credit, meaning that they don't believe it will affect their business. However, in addition to the loss of the tax credit, renewable energy payments from utilities to customers is also declining.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Federal tax credit ===
In addition to the state tax credit, which is over, the U.S. government gives a 30 percent tax credit for solar installations. In December 2015, Congress extended the program through the end of 2019.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Payments from utilities ===
[[PNM Resources|PNM]] and [[El Paso Electric|El Paso Electric Co]]. in southern New Mexico paid customers for each kilowatt hour of electricity they produced from their solar systems. These payments help customers and businesses offset the costs of installing their solar systems.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In addition to the payments, those companies offer net metering. Under net metering, people with solar systems can sell their excess electricity back to the utility company at a price equal to what the utility pays for its own electricity. Note that net metering is a separate system of payments from the renewable payments that utilities offer back to customers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

For example, 7,100 customers have signed up for the renewable payments from the utility PNM. In 2014, that number was only 4,400 customers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Payments from utilities back to customers decreased from $.13 per kilowatt hour in 2009 to $.025 by the end of 2015. As of the middle of 2016, PNM stopped accepting new applications because the number of people seeking the credits was more than the money available in the program.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to DSIRE, a program operated by the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, “If a customer has NEG [net energy generation] totaling less than $50 during a monthly billing period, the excess is carried over to the customer’s next monthly bill. If NEG exceeds $50 during a monthly billing period, the utility will pay the customer the following month for the excess.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

“The energy rate to be paid for the energy supplied by the QF [qualifying facility] in any month shall be the respective month's rate from the utility's current schedule on file with the PRC. Each utility shall file with the PRC its schedule containing monthly energy rates that will be applicable to the next twelve-month period.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Price of solar installation ==
According to a study by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, prices for the installation of residential and utility-scale solar generation plants went down by more than 50 percent between 2008 and 2014. In 2015, prices fell another 17 percent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

As of 2017, an average New Mexico residential system producing 4.4 kilowatts costs approximately $17,000 before tax credits and other incentives. After credits and incentives, the system would cost approximately $11,900. In 2009, that same system had cost $30,000. If a consumer chose to finance the system, they could pay around $99 a month.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Regulatory rules ==
In New Mexico there are two primary rules that govern the interconnection of a solar system to the utility grid:
* NMPRC Rule 570 (general interconnection of qualifying facilities—larger solar-producing facilities)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmsea.org/Grid_Interconnection/570_RULE.htm|title=Rule 570|website=www.nmsea.org|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* NMPRC Rule 571 (net metering for small renewable energy systems)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmsea.org/Grid_Interconnection/571_RULE.htm|title=Net-Metering|website=www.nmsea.org|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the New Mexico Solar Energy Association, “These rules apply wherever electricity service is regulated by the PRC. This includes the areas serviced by New Mexico's four investor owned utilities (IOUs) (which encompasses Santa Fe and Albuquerque for example), and the areas services by electric coops. It does not include municipal utilities (such as Los Alamos and Farmington), which are self-regulated.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Additionally, “If the net-metered facility uses more power than it produces over a billing period, the utility may bill the customer for the net power used according to the rate structure that would apply to the customer if they had not connected as a net-metering facility.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Future of net metering in New Mexico ==
The solar industry in New Mexico is facing hurdles. Most utilities want to reduce incentives like net metering and charge customers more who have solar systems. The reason they want to do this is because the utilities maintain that their role in generating plants, transmitting and distributing electricity through distribution lines, and other fixed costs remain unchanged. They argue that solar customers are not financially contributing to those fixed costs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A '''nunatak''' (from [[Inuit language|Inuit]] ''nunataq'') is an exposed, often rocky element of a ridge, mountain, or peak not covered with ice or snow within (or at the edge of) an ice field or [[glacier]]. They are also called '''glacial islands'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Physical Geography: Hydrosphere'', 2006, {{ISBN|8183561675}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T1Y_Ytx9wp4C&amp;pg=PA114 p. 114]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are natural [[pyramidal peak]]s.

The word is of [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] origin&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web
|title=Merriam-Webster: nunatak
|url=http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=nunatak
|accessdate=October 16, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used in English since the 1870s.

==Description==
The term is typically used in areas where a permanent [[ice sheet]] is present and the nunataks protrude above the sheet.&lt;ref name="Zeeberg"&gt;J. J. Zeeberg, ''Climate and Glacial History of the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago, Russian Arctic''. pp. 82-84&lt;/ref&gt; Nunataks present readily identifiable landmark reference points in glaciers or ice caps and are often named. While some nunataks are isolated, sometimes they form dense clusters, such as [[Queen Louise Land]] in Greenland.&lt;ref name="mapcartaQL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapcarta.com/19193676|title=Dronning Louise Land|work=Mapcarta|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nunataks are generally angular and jagged, which hampers the formation of glacial ice on their tops, although snow can accumulate on them. They usually contrast strongly with the softer contours of the glacially eroded land after a glacier retreats. 

Typically nunataks are the only places where plant life can survive on the ice sheets or ice caps. Lifeforms on nunataks are frequently isolated by the surrounding ice or glacier,  providing unique habitats.&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;[http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/ice-cap/ ice cap - National Geographic Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25870">'''Planetary mass''' is a measure of the [[mass]] of a [[planet]]-like object. Within the [[Solar System]], planets are usually measured in the [[astronomical system of units]], where the unit of mass is the [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}), the mass of the [[Sun]]. In the study of [[extrasolar planet]]s, the unit of measure is typically the mass of [[Jupiter]] ({{Jupiter mass|link=y}}) for large [[gas giant]] planets, and the mass of [[Earth]] ({{Earth mass|link=y}}) for smaller rocky [[terrestrial planet]]s.

The mass of a planet within the Solar System is an adjusted parameter in the preparation of [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]]. There are three variations of how planetary mass can be calculated:
* If the planet has [[natural satellite]]s, its mass can be calculated using [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] to derive a generalization of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's third law]] that includes the mass of the planet and its moon. This permitted an early measurement of Jupiter's mass, as measured in units of the [[solar mass]].
* The mass of a planet can be inferred from its effect on the [[orbit]]s of other planets. In 1931-1948 flawed applications of this method led to incorrect calculations of the [[Pluto#Demise of Planet X|mass of Pluto]]. 
* Data from influence collected from the orbits of [[space probe]]s can be used. Examples include [[Voyager program|''Voyager'' probes]] to the outer planets and the [[MESSENGER]] spacecraft to [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].
* Also, numerous other methods can give reasonable approximations. For instance, [[20000 Varuna|Varuna]], a potential [[dwarf planet]], rotates very quickly upon its axis, as does the dwarf planet [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]]. Haumea has to have a very high density in order not to be ripped apart by [[centrifugal force]]s. Through some calculations, one can place a limit on the object's density. Thus, if the object's size is known, a limit on the mass can be determined. See the links in the aforementioned articles for more details on this.

== Choice of units ==

The choice of [[solar mass]], {{Solar mass|link=y}}, as the basic unit for planetary mass comes directly from the calculations used to determine planetary mass. In the most precise case, that of the [[Earth]] itself, the mass is known in terms of solar masses to twelve [[significant figures]]: the same mass, in terms of [[kilogram]]s or other Earth-based units, is only known to five significant figures, which is less than a millionth as precise.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;"[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecK/2009/Astronomical_Constants_2009.pdf 2009 Selected Astronomical Constants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327014818/http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecK/2009/Astronomical_Constants_2009.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}" in {{citation | title = The Astronomical Almanac Online | url = http://asa.usno.navy.mil/ | publisher = [[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]]–[[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|UKHO]] }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference comes from the way in which planetary masses are calculated. It is impossible to "weigh" a planet, and much less the Sun, against the sort of mass standards which are used in the laboratory. On the other hand, the orbits of the planets give a great range of observational data as to the relative positions of each body, and these positions can be compared to their relative masses using [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] (with small corrections for [[General Relativity]] where necessary). To convert these relative masses to Earth-based units such as the kilogram, it is necessary to know the value of the [[Newtonian gravitational constant]], ''G''. This constant is remarkably difficult to measure in practice, and its value is only known to a precision of one part in ten-thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{CODATA2006|url=http://www.physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?bg}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The solar mass is quite a large unit on the scale of the Solar System: 1.9884(2){{e|30}}&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt; The largest planet, [[Jupiter]], is 0.09% the mass of the Sun, while the Earth is about three millionths (0.0003%) of the mass of the Sun. Various different conventions are used in the literature to overcome this problem: for example, inverting the ratio so that one quotes the planetary mass in the 'number of planets' it would take to make up one Sun.&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt; Here, we have chosen to list all planetary masses in 'microSuns' – that is the mass of the Earth is just over three 'microSuns', or three millionths of the mass of the Sun – unless they are specifically quoted in kilograms.

When comparing the planets among themselves, it is often convenient to use the [[Earth mass|mass of the Earth]] (''M''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; or {{Earth mass}}) as a standard, particularly for the [[terrestrial planet]]s. For the mass of [[gas giant]]s, and also for most [[extrasolar planet]]s and [[brown dwarf]]s, the mass of Jupiter ({{Jupiter mass}}) is a convenient comparison.

== Planetary mass and planet formation ==
[[File:Vesta-HST-Color.jpg|thumb|[[4 Vesta|Vesta]] is the second largest body in the [[asteroid belt]] after [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. This image from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] shows that it is far from being spherical.]]

The mass of a planet has consequences for its structure by having a large mass, especially while it is in the hand of [[Nebular hypothesis|process of formation]]. A body which is more than about one ten-thousandth of the mass of the Earth can overcome its [[compressive strength]] and achieve [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]: it will be roughly [[Sphere|spherical]], and since 2006 has been classified as a [[dwarf planet]] if it orbits around the Sun (that is, if it is not the [[Natural satellite|satellite]] of another planet). Smaller bodies like [[asteroid]]s are classified as "[[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]]".

A dwarf planet, by definition, is not massive enough to have gravitationally [[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared its neighbouring region]] of [[planetesimal]]s: it is not known quite how large a planet must be before it can effectively clear its neighbourhood, but one tenth of the Earth's mass is certainly sufficient.

The smaller planets retain only [[silicates]], and are [[terrestrial planet]]s like Earth or [[Mars]], though multiple-''M''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; [[super-Earths]] have been discovered. The interior structure of rocky planets is mass-dependent: for example, [[plate tectonics]] may require a minimum mass to generate sufficient temperatures and pressures for it to occur.&lt;ref&gt;CfA Press Release Release No.: 2008-02 January 09, 2008 [http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/press/2008/pr200802.html Earth: A Borderline Planet for Life?]&lt;/ref&gt;

If the protoplanet grows by [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] to more than about {{Earth mass|5–10}}, its gravity become large enough to retain [[hydrogen]] in its [[atmosphere]]. In this case, it will grow into a [[gas giant]]. If the planet then begins [[planetary migration|migration]], it may move well within its system's [[frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], and become a [[hot Jupiter]] orbiting very close to its star, then gradually losing small amounts of mass as the star's radiation strips its atmosphere.

The theoretical minimum mass a star can have, and still undergo hydrogen [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] at the core, is estimated to be about {{Jupiter mass|75}}, though fusion of [[deuterium]] can occur at masses as low as 13 Jupiters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Earth mass and lunar mass ===

Where a planet has natural satellites, its mass is usually quoted for the whole system (planet + satellites), as it is the mass of the whole system which acts as a perturbation on the orbits of other planets. The distinction is very slight, as natural satellites are much smaller than their parent planets (as can be seen in the table above, where only the largest satellites are even listed).

The Earth and the Moon form a case in point, partly because the Moon is unusually large (just over 1% of the mass of the Earth) in relation to its parent planet compared with other natural satellites. There are also very precise data available for the Earth–Moon system, particularly from the [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]] (LLR).

The [[geocentric gravitational constant]] – the product of the mass of the Earth times the [[Newtonian gravitational constant]] – can be measured to high precision from the orbits of the Moon and of artificial satellites. The ratio of the two masses can be determined from the slight wobble in the Earth's orbit caused by the gravitational attraction of the Moon.

The construction of a full, high-precision Solar System ephemeris is an onerous task.&lt;ref name="EPM"&gt;{{citation | last = Pitjeva | first = E. V. | authorlink = Elena V. Pitjeva | date = 2005 | title = High-Precision Ephemerides of Planets—EPM and Determination of Some Astronomical Constants | url = http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/EPM2004.pdf | journal = Solar System Research | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 176–86 | doi = 10.1007/s11208-005-0033-2|bibcode = 2005SoSyR..39..176P }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible (and somewhat simpler) to construct partial ephemerides which only concern the planets (or dwarf planets, satellites, asteroids) of interest by "fixing" the motion of the other planets in the model. The two methods are not strictly equivalent, especially when it comes to assigning uncertainties to the results: however, the "best" estimates – at least in terms of quoted uncertainties in the result – for the masses of minor planets and asteroids usually come from partial ephemerides.

Nevertheless, new complete ephemerides continue to be prepared, most notably the EPM2004 ephemeris from the Institute of Applied Astronomy of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. EPM2004 is based on {{gaps|317|014}} separate observations between 1913 and 2003, more than seven times as many as DE405, and gave more precise masses for [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] and five asteroids.&lt;ref name="EPM" /&gt;

The Project owns some of the UK's most iconic coast including land near the [[Giant's Causeway]] in [[Northern Ireland]], {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} of the [[White Cliffs of Dover]] and [[The Needles]].&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fifty"/&gt;  The project includes four [[World Heritage Site]]s and nine [[lighthouse]]s.&lt;ref name=coast/&gt;  The Project has not been completely successful in achieving its ambitions, having had its £1 million bid for [[Land's End]] turned down in 1981.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

'''R/V ''Rachel Carson''''' is a [[research vessel]] owned and operated by the [[University of Washington]]'s School of Oceanography, named in honor of the marine biologist and writer [[Rachel Carson]]. The vessel is part of the [[University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System|UNOLS]] fleet. It is capable of conducting operations within the [[Salish Sea]] and coastal waters of the western United States and British Columbia. She can accommodate up to 28 persons, including the crew, for day operations, while up to 13 can be accommodated for multi-day operations.&lt;ref name="UWSO-RVRC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="king5-1st-voyage"/&gt;

==Service history==

===R/V ''Aora'', 2003–2016=== 
The ship was originally launched in May 2003 at the Macduff Shipyard in [[Macduff, Aberdeenshire|Macduff]], Scotland, as the 
R/V ''Aora'', a [[fisheries research vessel]].&lt;ref name="UWSO-RVRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ocean.washington.edu/story/RV_Rachel_Carson |title=R/V Rachel Carson |date=2018 |website=University of Washington School of Oceanography |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was based at the [[University Marine Biological Station Millport]] in the [[Firth of Clyde]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riverclydephotography.uk/2010/12/rv-aora.html |title=R/V Aora |last=Ward |first=Gerard |date=6 December 2010 |website=River Clyde Photography |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the station was closed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.field-studies-council.org/centres/scotland/millport/about/history.aspx |title=Millport History |website=[[Field Studies Council]] |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===R/V ''Rachel Carson'', 2017–present=== 
In 2015 the University of Washington's School of Oceanography wanted to replace the fifty-year old {{ship|RV|Clifford A. Barnes}}, but were unable to raise the funds required to design and build a replacement. In December 2016 they found the ''Aora'' for sale on a yacht-trading website.&lt;ref name="king5-1st-voyage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/uw-launches-1st-voyage-saturday-on-bigger-better-research-ship/281-536058226 |title=UW launches 1st voyage Saturday on bigger, better research ship |last=Farley |first=Glenn  |date=6 April 2018 |website=[[KING-TV]] |access-date=25 November 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407042551/https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/uw-launches-1st-voyage-saturday-on-bigger-better-research-ship/281-536058226 |archive-date=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irso.info"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irso.info/wp-content/uploads/Russell-RV-Rachel-Carson-Presentation-26-Sept-2018-IRSO-copy.pdf |title=R/V Rachel Carson |first=Doug |last=Russell |date=26 September 2018 |website=International Research Ship Operators |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an inspection in March 2017, the ship was purchased for $1.07m on 8 August 2017,&lt;ref name="irso.info"/&gt; with the aid of a $1m gift.&lt;ref name="new-uw-vessel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2018/05/10/new-uw-vessel-rv-rachel-carson-will-explore-regional-waters/ |title=New UW vessel, RV Rachel Carson, will explore regional waters |last=Hickey |first=Hannah |date=May 10, 2018 |website=UW News |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A programme of maintenance and some modifications at the MacDuff yard were completed in October, and the ''Rachel Carson'' was transported by ship from [[Rotterdam]] to [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] by early November.&lt;ref name="irso.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macduffshipdesign.com/news/the-rachel-carson-transported-to-the-university-of-washington/ |title=The "Rachel Carson" transported to the University of Washington |date=16 December 2017 |website=MacDuff Ship Design |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was then transported to the University of Washington, arriving on 28 December.

{{legend|#FF7E00|[[Volcanic explosivity index|Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) 7]]}}]]
A '''supervolcano''' is a large volcano that has had an [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] of magnitude 8, which is the largest value on the [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] (VEI). This means the volume of deposits for that eruption is greater than 1,000 cubic kilometers (240 cubic miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/yellowstone/yellowstone_sub_page_49.html |title=Questions About Supervolcanoes |publisher=[[USGS]] Yellowstone Volcano Observatory |work=Volcanic Hazards Program |date=2015-08-21 |accessdate=2017-08-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703184836/https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/yellowstone/yellowstone_sub_page_49.html |archivedate=3 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supervolcanoes occur when [[magma]] in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] rises into the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] but is unable to break through it and pressure builds in a large and growing magma pool until the crust is unable to contain the pressure. This can occur at [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] (for example, [[Yellowstone Caldera]]) or at [[subduction]] zones (for example, [[Lake Toba|Toba]]). Another setting for the eruption of very large amounts of volcanic material is in [[large igneous province]]s, which can cover huge areas with lava and [[volcanic ash]], causing long-lasting [[climate change]] (such as the triggering of a small [[ice age]]), which can [[Extinction event|threaten species with extinction]]. The [[Oruanui eruption]] of New Zealand's [[Taupo Volcano]] (about 26,500 years ago)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0377-0273(01)00239-6| title = The 26.5ka Oruanui eruption, New Zealand: An introduction and overview| journal = Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research| volume = 112| issue = 1–4| pages = 133–174| year = 2001| last1 = Wilson | first1 = C.

== Terminology ==
The origin of the term "supervolcano" is linked to an early 20th-century scientific debate about the geological history and features of the [[Three Sisters (Oregon)|Three Sisters]] volcanic region of [[Oregon]] in the United States. In 1925, Edwin T. Hodge suggested that a very large volcano, which he named [[Mount Multnomah]], had existed in that region. He believed that several [[Summit (topography)|peaks]] in the Three Sisters area are the remnants of Mount Multnomah after it had been largely destroyed by violent volcanic explosions, similar to [[Mount Mazama]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Stephen (1988) ''Fire Mountains of the West: The Cascade and Mono Lake Volcanoes'', Missoula, Mountain Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the possible existence of Mount Multnomah was ignored by volcanologist [[Howel Williams]] in his book ''The Ancient Volcanoes of Oregon''. The book was reviewed in 1949 by another volcanologist, F. M. Byers Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Byers, Jr., F. M. (1949) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30058757 ''Reviews: The Ancient Volcanoes of Oregon by Howel Williams''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308053857/http://www.jstor.org/stable/30058757 |date=8 March 2016 }}, The Journal of Geology, volume 57, number 3, May 1949, page 324. Retrieved 2012-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the review, Byers refers to Mount Multnomah as a supervolcano.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oed.com/view/Entry/311217 ''supervolcano, n.''] Oxford English Dictionary, third edition, online version June 2012. Retrieved on 2012-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been proven that each peak of the Three Sisters was formed independently, and that Mount Multnomah did not exist. 

Over fifty years after Williams' book was published, the term ''supervolcano'' was popularised by the [[BBC]] [[popular science]] television program ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' in 2000, to refer to eruptions that produce extremely large amounts of [[ejecta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/1999/supervolcanoes.shtml Supervolcanoes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030801131249/http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/1999/supervolcanoes.shtml |date=1 August 2003 }}.

Vulcan.wr.usgs.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''megacaldera'' is sometimes used for [[caldera]] supervolcanoes, such as the [[Blake River Megacaldera Complex]] in the [[Abitibi greenstone belt]] of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. Eruptions that rate VEI&amp;nbsp;8 are termed "super eruptions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=de Silva, Shanaka|title=Arc magmatism, calderas, and supervolcanos|journal=Geology|year=2008|volume=36|issue=8|pages=671–672|doi=10.1130/focus082008.1|url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/36/8/671.full|bibcode=2008Geo....36..671D|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521023000/http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/36/8/671.full|archivedate=21 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there is no well-defined minimum explosive size for a "supervolcano", there are at least two types of volcanic eruptions that have been identified as supervolcanoes: [[large igneous province]]s and massive eruptions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url= |title=The largest volcanic eruptions on Earth |last=Bryan |first=S.E. |date=2010 |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=102 |issue=3–4 |pages=207–229 |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2010.07.001 |pmid= |accessdate=|bibcode=2010ESRv..102..207B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Large igneous provinces ==
{{Main|Large igneous province}}

Large igneous provinces, such as [[Geology of Iceland|Iceland]], the [[Siberian Traps]], [[Deccan Traps]], and the [[Ontong Java Plateau]], are extensive regions of [[basalt]]s on a continental scale resulting from [[flood basalt]] eruptions. When created, these regions often occupy several thousand square kilometres and have volumes on the order of millions of cubic kilometers. In most cases, the lavas are normally laid down over several million years. They release large amounts of gases.

The [[Réunion hotspot]] produced the Deccan Traps about 66&amp;nbsp;million years ago, coincident with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. The scientific consensus is that a [[meteor]] impact was the cause of the extinction event, but the volcanic activity may have caused environmental stresses on extant species up to the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Deccan volcanism, the Chicxulub impact, and the end-Cretaceous mass extinction: Coincidence? Cause and effect?|last = Keller|first = G|date = 2014|journal = Geological Society of America Special Papers|volume = 505|pages = 57–89|doi = 10.1130/2014.2505(03)|pmid = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the largest flood basalt event (the Siberian Traps) occurred around 250&amp;nbsp;million years ago and was coincident with the largest mass extinction in history, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], although it is unknown whether it was solely responsible for the extinction event.

Such outpourings are not explosive, though [[lava fountain]]s may occur. Many volcanologists consider that [[Iceland]] may be a large igneous province that is currently being formed. The last major outpouring occurred in 1783–84 from the [[Laki fissure]] which is approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. An estimated {{convert|14|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} of basaltic lava was poured out during the eruption.

The [[Ontong Java Plateau]] has an area of about {{convert|2000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and the province was at least 50% larger before the [[Manihiki Plateau|Manihiki]] and [[Hikurangi Plateau]]s broke away.

== Massive explosive eruptions ==
{{seealso|World's largest eruptions}}
[[File:HotspotsSRP update2013.JPG|thumb|Location of Yellowstone hotspot over time (numbers indicate millions of years before the present).]]

Volcanic eruptions are classified using the [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]], or VEI. It is a [[logarithmic scale]], which means that an increase of one in VEI number is equivalent to a tenfold increase in volume of erupted material. VEI 7 or VEI 8 eruptions are so powerful that they often form circular calderas rather than [[volcanic cone|cones]] because the downward withdrawal of magma causes the overlying rock mass to collapse into the empty [[magma chamber]] beneath it.

The [[United States Senate]] '''Committee on Energy and Natural Resources''' has jurisdiction over matters related to energy and nuclear waste policy, territorial policy, native Hawaiian matters, and public lands.

Its roots go back to the '''Committee on Interior and Insulars Affair'''.  In 1977, it became the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and Indian Affairs were removed from its jurisdiction into its own committee.

'''Vaalbara''' was an [[Archean]] [[supercontinent]] consisting of the [[Kaapvaal Craton]] (now located in eastern [[South Africa]]) and the [[Pilbara Craton]] (now found in north-western [[Western Australia]]).  E.S. Cheney derived the name from the last four letters of each craton's name.  The two cratons consist of crust dating from 2.7 to 3.6 [[Gya]], which would make Vaalbara [[Earth]]'s earliest supercontinent.&lt;ref name="Zegers-etal-1998-Abst"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zegers|de Wit|White|1998|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existence and lifespan==
{{Life timeline}}
There has been some debate as to when and if Vaalbara even existed.

An Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic (2.8{{mdash}}2.1 Ga) link between South Africa and Western Australia was first proposed by {{Harvnb|Button|1976}}.  He found a wide range of similarities between the [[Transvaal Basin]] in South Africa and the [[Hamersley Basin]] in Australia.  Button, however, placed Madagascar between Africa and Australia and concluded that Gondwana must have had a long stable tectonic history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Button|1976|loc=Synopsis, p. 262; for Button's reconstruction see fig. 20f, p. 286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in the reconstruction of [[#{{Harvid|Rogers|1993}}|Rogers 1993]], [[#{{harvid|Rogers|1996}}|1996]] the oldest continent is [[Ur (continent)|Ur]]. In Rogers' reconstructions, however, Kaapvaal and Pilbara are placed far apart already in their Gondwana configuration, a reconstruction contradicted by later orogenic events and incompatible with the Vaalbara hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Kock|Evans|Beukes|2009|loc=Introduction, pp. 145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvnb|Cheney|1996}}, nevertheless, found a three-fold stratigraphic similarity and proposed that the two cratons once formed a continent which he named Vaalbara.  This model is supported by the palaeomagnetic data of {{Harvnb|Zegers|de Wit|White|1998}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zhao|Sun|Wilde|Li|2004|pp=96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reconstructions of the palaeolatitudes of the two cratons at 2.78–2.77&amp;nbsp;Ga are ambiguous however.  In the reconstruction of {{Harvnb|Wingate|1998}} they fail to overlap, but they do in more recent reconstructions, for example {{Harvnb|Strik|Blake|Zegers|White|2003}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Strik|Blake|Zegers|White|2003|loc=Implications for the Vaalbara Hypothesis, pp. 19–20, fig. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientists dispute the existence of Vaalbara and explain similarities between the two cratons as the product of global processes.  They point to, for example, thick volcanic deposits on other cratons such as [[Amazonian Craton|Amazonia]], [[São Francisco Craton|São Francisco]], and [[Karnataka Craton|Karnataka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|Trendall|Altermann|1999|loc=Independent development of the Pilbara and Kaapvaal cratons — implications, pp. 186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimgarn, another proposed supercraton composed of the [[Zimbabwe Craton|Zimbabwe]] and [[Yilgarn Craton|Yilgarn]] cratons at 2.41&amp;nbsp;Ga, is distinct from Vaalbara.  Zimgarn should have disintegrated around 2.1–2.0&amp;nbsp;Ga to reassemble as the [[Kalahari Craton|Kalahari]] and West Australian (Yilgarn and Pilbara) cratons around 1.95–1.8&amp;nbsp;Ga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smirnov|Evans|Ernst|Söderlund|2013|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic [[Grunehogna Craton]] in [[Dronning Maud Land]], [[East Antarctica]], formed the eastern part of the Kalahari Craton for at least a billion years.  Grunehogna collided with the rest of East Antarctica during the Mesoproterozoic assembly of the supercontinent [[Rodinia]] and the [[Grenville orogeny]].  The Neoproterozoic [[Pan-African orogeny]] and the assembly of Gondwana/[[Pannotia]] produced large shear zones between Grunehogna and Kalahari.  During the Jurassic break-up of Gondwana these shear zones finally separated Grunehogna and the rest of Antarctica from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marschall|Hawkesworth|Storey|Dhuime|2010|loc=Geology of the Grunehogna Craton, pp. 2278–2280}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Annandags Peaks]], the only exposed parts of Grunehogna, [[Detritus (geology)|detrital]] [[zircon]]s from several crustal sources have been dated to 3.9–3.0&amp;nbsp;Ga suggesting intracrustal recycling was an important part in the formation of the first cratons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marschall|Hawkesworth|Storey|Dhuime|2010|loc=Conclusions, p. 2298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kaapvaal craton is marked by dramatic events such as the intrusion of the [[Bushveld Igneous Complex|Bushveld Complex]] (2.045&amp;nbsp;Ga) and the [[Vredefort crater|Vredefort impact event]] (2.025&amp;nbsp;Ga), and no traces of these events have been found in the Pilbara craton, clearly indicating that the two cratons were separated before 2.05&amp;nbsp;Ga.&lt;ref name="Zegers-etal-Disc" /&gt;  Furthermore, [[Geochronology|geochronological]] and [[Paleomagnetism|palaeomagnetic]] evidence show that the two cratons had a rotational 30° latitudinal separation in the time period of 2.78–2.77&amp;nbsp;Ga, which indicates they were no longer joined after c. 2.8 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wingate|1998|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaalbara thus remained stable for 1–0.4&amp;nbsp;Ga and hence had a life span similar to that of later supercontinents such as [[Gondwana]] and [[Rodinia]].&lt;ref name="Zegers-etal-Disc"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zegers|de Wit|White|1998|loc=Discussion, pp. 255–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some palaeomagnetic reconstructions suggest a Palaeoarchaean Proto-Vaalbara is possible, although the existence of this 3.6–3.2&amp;nbsp;Ga continent can't be unequivocally proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biggin|de Wit|Langereis|Zegers|2011|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence for Vaalbara==
South Africa's Kaapvaal craton and Western Australia's Pilbara craton have similar early [[Precambrian]] cover sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Kock|2008|p=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaapvaal's Barberton [[Greenstone belt|granite-greenstone]] [[terrane]] and Pilbara's eastern block show evidence of four large meteorite impacts between 3.2 and 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Byerly|Lowe|Wooden|Xie|2002|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Similar greenstone belts are now found at the margins of the [[Superior craton]] of [[Canada]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nitescu|Cruden|Bailey|2006|loc=Fig. 1, p. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high temperatures created by the impact’s force fused sediments into small glassy spherules.&lt;ref name=crater&gt;{{Harvnb|Erickson|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spherules of 3.5 billion years old exist in South Africa and spherules of a similar age have been found in Western Australia,&lt;ref name=crater/&gt; they are the oldest-known terrestrial impact products.&lt;ref name=lowe&gt;{{Harvnb|Lowe|Byerly|1986|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spherules resemble the glassy [[chondrule]]s (rounded granules) in carbonaceous [[chondrites]], which are found in carbon-rich meteorites and lunar soils.&lt;ref name=crater/&gt;

Remarkably similar lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic structural sequences between these two cratons have been noted for the period between 3.5 and 2.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=mega/&gt; Paleomagnetic data from two ultramafic complexes in the cratons showed that at {{mya|3870|million years}} the two cratons could have been part of the same supercontinent.&lt;ref name=mega&gt;{{Harvnb|Zegers|Ocampo|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Pilbara and Kaapvaal cratons show extensional faults which were active about {{mya|3470|million years ago}} during felsic [[volcanism]] and coeval with the impact layers.&lt;ref name=mega/&gt;

==Origin of life==
{{See also|Abiogenesis}}
The Pilbara and Kaapvaal cratons are some of the oldest rocks in the world and they contain well-preserved Archaean microfossils.  A series of international drilling projects has revealed traces of microbial life and photosynthesis from the Archaean in both Africa and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Philippot|Van Kranendonk|Van Zuilen|Lepot|2009|loc=Abstract}}; {{Harvnb|Waldbauer|Sherman|Sumner|Summons|2009|loc=Conclusions, p. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The oldest widely accepted evidence of photosynthesis by early life forms is molecular fossils found in 2.7&amp;nbsp;Ga-old shales in the Pilbara Craton.  These fossils have been interpreted as traces of [[eukaryote]]s and [[cyanobacteria]], though some scientists argue that these biomarkers must have entered these rocks later and date the fossils to 2.15–1.68&amp;nbsp;Ga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rasmussen|Fletcher|Brocks|Kilburn|2008|p=1101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This later time span agrees with estimates based on [[molecular clock]]s which dates the eukaryote [[last common ancestor]] at 1866–1679&amp;nbsp;Ma.  If the Pilbara fossils are traces of early eukaryotes, they could represent groups that went extinct before modern groups emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parfrey|Lahr|Knoll|Katz|2011|loc=Discussion, p. 13626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Vitrified]] sand''' is sand that has been heated to a high enough temperature as to partly melt the [[silicon dioxide]] or [[quartz]] that is the main ingredient of common sand. When sand is used to make [[glass]];
 [[soda ash]] or [[potash]] are added to lower the melting point. Pure quartz melts at {{convert|1650|C|F|0}}. There are several natural processes that produce more or less melted sand and one man-made form:

*[[fulgurite]] is sand fused by a lightning bolt hitting sand.
*[[tektite]] is sand fused by the compressive heat of a meteor strike including [[moldavite]] a gem quality stone mined in some locations.
*[[frit]] is partially fused sand plus other chemicals in the process of glaze and glass making.
*[[trinitite]] vitrified sand forms below nuclear blasts close to a sand surface. Examples include, [[Trinity (nuclear test)]] and [[Emu Field]].

[[Volcanic glass]] in many forms is not fused sand because it is formed from molten material.

The '''World Sustainable Energy Days''' is an annual [[sustainability]] conference held in [[Austria]]. It hosts events centred on sustainable energy production and use, which covers energy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] sources for buildings, industry and transport. The events that take place during the World Sustainable Energy Days present the latest technology trends, outstanding examples and European strategies and offer opportunities to establish new partnerships. The conference raises awareness of [[green energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].

Since 1992 every year in March experts and decision makers from all over the world flock to [[Upper Austria]] to attend the events - in general the conference attracts between 900 and 1,000 participants from 55-60 countries.

In parallel to the World Sustainable Energy Days, the [[:de:Energiesparmesse Wels|Energiesparmesse]], an exhibition and trade show dedicated to renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, is held. It attracts around 100,000 visitors and around 1,000 exhibiting companies.

The World Sustainable Energy Days are organised by the O.Ö. Energiesparverband ([[:de:O.Ö. Energiesparverband|O.Ö. Energiesparverband]] in German), the regional energy agency of Upper Austria.

The '''Yellowstone Volcano Observatory''' ('''YVO''') is a [[volcano observatory]] that monitors the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the [[United States]]. The observatory's jurisdiction also includes unmonitored but recently active volcanic centers (mostly [[Holocene]] age) in the states of [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], and [[New Mexico]]. As with other U.S. volcano observatories, it is funded through the [[United States Geological Survey]] [http://volcanoes.usgs.gov Volcano Hazards Program].&lt;ref&gt;[http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/ Yellowstone Volcano Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory consists of 8 member agencies:  
The [http://www.usgs.gov USGS], the [http://www.seis.utah.edu/ University of Utah], the [http://www.uwyo.edu/geolgeophys/ University of Wyoming], [http://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm Yellowstone National Park], the [http://mbmgquake.mtech.edu Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology], the [http://www.wsgs.uwyo.edu Wyoming State Geological Survey], the [http://www.idahogeology.org Idaho Geological Survey] and [http://www.unavco.org UNAVCO, Inc].&lt;ref&gt;http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/yvo_about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

YVO was founded in 2001, originally as a three-way partnership with the USGS, the University of Utah and Yellowstone National Park.  It was expanded in 2013 to include all eight current organizations&lt;ref&gt;http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/yvo_news_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the YVO website, the purpose of the observatory is: to monitor the volcanic system, to increase our scientific understanding of the Yellowstone volcanic and hydrothermal system, and to disseminate data, interpretations and accumulated knowledge to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/yvo_about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory undertook a monitoring plan in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2006/5276/ U.S. Geological Survey  Scientific Investigations Report 2006-5276]&lt;/ref&gt; that served as the basis for upgrades undertaken by the [http://pbo.unavco.org Plate Boundary Observatory], and by the USGS under the auspices of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/new-sensors-to-monitor-yellowstone-super-volcano/article_f40dfb96-f1d5-11de-b705-001cc4c03286.html 10 new sensors to monitor Yellowstone super volcano: Missoulian, Dec. 25, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, it published its initial response plan that sets up a series of internal protocols for data gathering and deliberation during geological events at Yellowstone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1351/ USGS Circular 1351]&lt;/ref&gt;  Staff from the various observatory partner agencies form several monitoring and information teams that assess geological and geophysical data. The document also outlines how the observatory would interact with the  [[incident command system]].

YVO provides a monthly update through its website as well as information statements for events that fall in between their normal updates.  All updates are listed on the [http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/activity/status.php#yvo VHP Alert Page].  Individuals can receive automated updates through the [http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vns/ Volcano Notification Service].

In 2005, a BBC/Discovery docudrama entitled [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419372/ Supervolcano] was released on cable television.   The drama imagines the reaction of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory to a super eruption at the [[Yellowstone Caldera]].  Producer Ailsa Orr credits YVO scientists as inspiration for the film's three primary characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/02_february/15/supervolcano_making.shtml Supervolcano erupts onto BBC ONE]&lt;/ref&gt;  The YVO Scientist-in-Charge reflected on the hype associated with volcanism at Yellowstone in a 2005 magazine article.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/june05/feature_supervolcano.html&lt;/ref&gt;
