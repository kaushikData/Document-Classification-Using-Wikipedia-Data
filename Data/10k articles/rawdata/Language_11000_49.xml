'''Arabic verbs''' ({{lang|ar|فِعْل}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fiʿl}}''; {{abbr|pl.|plural}} {{lang|ar|أَفْعَال}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|afʿāl}}''), like the verbs in other [[Semitic languages]], and the entire vocabulary in those languages, are based on a set of two, three, four and also five (but mainly three) consonants  called a [[Semitic root|root]] (''triliteral'' or ''quadriliteral'' according to the number of consonants). The root communicates the basic meaning of the verb, e.g. كتب ''{{transl|ar|ALA|k-t-b}}'' 'write', قرء ''{{transl|ar|ALA|q-r-ʾ}}'' 'read', أكل ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʾ-k-l}}'' 'eat'. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as person, gender, number, tense, mood, and voice.

Various categories are marked on verbs:
* Three [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] (present, past; future tense is indicated by the prefix ''{{transl|ar|sa-}}'' or the particle ''{{transl|ar|sawfa}}'' and the present tense).
* Two [[Grammatical voice|voices]] (active, passive)
* Two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine)
* Three [[Grammatical person|persons]] (first, second, third)
* Three [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], plural)
* Six [[Grammatical mood|moods]] in the non-past only ([[realis mood#Indicative|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[jussive mood|jussive]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], and, only in [[Classical Arabic]], short and long [[realis mood#Energetic|energetics]])
* Nineteen forms, the derivational systems indicating derivative concepts such as [[intensive]], [[causative]], [[reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocal]], [[reflexive verb|reflexive]], [[frequentative]] etc. For each form, there is also an active and a passive [[participle]] (both adjectives, declined through the full paradigm of gender, number, case and state) and a [[verbal noun]] (declined for case; also, when lexicalized, may be declined for number).

Weakness is an inherent property of a given verb determined by the particular consonants of the verb root (corresponding to a [[verb conjugation]] in [[Classical Latin]] and other European languages), with five main types of weakness and two or three subtypes of each type.

Arabic grammarians typically use the root فعل ''{{transl|ar|ALA|f-ʿ-l}}'' to indicate the particular shape of any given element of a verbal paradigm.  As an example, the form يتكاتب ''{{transl|ar|yutakātabu}}'' 'he is corresponded (with)' would be listed generically as يتفاعل ''{{transl|ar|yutafāʿalu}}'', specifying the generic shape of a strong Form VI passive verb, third-person masculine singular present indicative.

The maximum possible total number of verb forms derivable from a root — not counting participles and verbal nouns — is approximately 13 person/number/gender forms; times 7.385 tense/mood combinations, counting the ''{{transl|ar|sa-}}'' future (since the moods are active only in the present tense, and the imperative has only 5 of the 13 paradigmatic forms); times 17 form/voice combinations (since forms IX, XI–XV exist only for a small number of stative roots, and form VII cannot normally form a passive), for a total of 1,632.  Each of these has its own stem form, and each of these stem forms itself comes in numerous varieties, according to the weakness (or lack thereof) of the underlying root.

==Inflectional categories==
Each particular [[lexical verb]] is specified by four stems, two each for the [[active voice|active]] and [[passive voice]]s.  In a particular voice, one stem (the ''past stem'') is used for the past tense, and the other (the ''non-past stem'') is used for the [[present tense|present]] and [[future tense]]s, along with non-indicative [[grammatical mood|mood]]s, e.g. [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]].  The past and non-past stems are sometimes also called the ''[[perfective]] stem'' and ''[[imperfective]] stem'', respectively, based on a traditional misinterpretation of Arabic stems as representing [[grammatical aspect]] rather than [[grammatical tense]]. (Although there is still some disagreement about the interpretation of the stems as tense or aspect, the dominant current view is that the stems simply represent tense, sometimes of a relative rather than absolute nature.  There are some unusual usages of the stems in certain contexts that were once interpreted as indicating aspectual distinctions, but are now thought to simply be idiosyncratic constructions that do not neatly fit into any aspectual paradigm.){{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

To the past stem, suffixes are added to mark the verb for person, number and gender, while to the non-past stem, a combination of prefixes and suffixes are added. (Very approximately, the prefixes specify the person and the suffixes indicate number and gender.) A total of 13 forms exist for each of the two stems, specifying person (first, second or third); number (singular, dual or plural); and gender (masculine or feminine).

There are six separate moods in the non-past: [[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[subjunctive]], [[Irrealis mood#Jussive|jussive]], short [[energetic mood|energetic]] and long [[energetic mood|energetic]]. The moods are generally marked by suffixes.  When no number suffix is present, the endings are ''{{transl|ar|-u}}'' for indicative, ''{{transl|ar|-a}}'' for subjunctive, no ending for imperative and jussive, ـَنْ ''{{transl|ar|-an}}'' for shorter energetic, ـَنَّ ''{{transl|ar|-anna}}'' for longer energetic.  When number suffixes are present, the moods are either distinguished by different forms of the suffixes (e.g. ـُونَ ''{{transl|ar|-ūna}}'' for masculine plural indicative vs. ـُو ''{{transl|ar|-ū}}'' for masculine plural subjunctive/imperative/jussive), or not distinguished at all.  The imperative exists only in the second person and is distinguished from the jussive by the lack of the normal second-person prefix ـت ''{{transl|ar|ta-/tu-}}''.

The third person masculine singular past tense form serves as the "dictionary form" used to identify a verb, similar to the [[infinitive]] in English. (Arabic has no infinitive.) For example, the verb meaning 'write' is often specified as كَتَبَ ''{{transl|ar|kataba}}'', which actually means 'he wrote'.  This indicates that the past-tense stem is كَتَبْـ ''{{transl|ar|katab-}}''; the corresponding non-past stem is ـكْتُبْـ ''{{transl|ar|-ktub-}}'', as in يَكْتُبُ ''{{transl|ar|yaktubu}}'' 'he writes'.

=== Tense ===

There are three tenses in Arabic: the past tense ({{lang|ar|اَلْمَاضِي}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-māḍī}}''), the present tense ({{lang|ar|اَلْمُضَارِع}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-muḍāriʿ}}'') and the future tense.  The future tense in Classical Arabic is formed by adding either the prefix {{wikt-lang|ar|سَـ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sa-}}'' or the separate word {{wikt-lang|ar|سَوْفَ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sawfa}}'' onto the beginning of the present tense verb, e.g. {{lang|ar|سَيَكْتُبُ}} {{transl|ar|ALA|sa-yaktubu}} or {{lang|ar|سَوْفَ يَكْتُبُ}} {{transl|ar|ALA|sawfa yaktubu}} 'he will write'.

In some contexts, the tenses represent [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] distinctions rather than tense distinctions.  The usage of Arabic tenses is as follows:
* The past tense often (but not always) specifically has the meaning of a past [[perfective]], i.e. it expresses the concept of 'he did' as opposed to 'he was doing'.  The latter can be expressed using the combination of the past tense of the verb {{lang|ar|كَانَ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kāna}}'' 'to be' with the present tense or active participle, e.g. {{lang|ar|كَانَ يَكْتُبُ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kāna yaktubu}}'' or {{lang|ar|كَانَ كَاتِبٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kāna kātibun}}'' 'he was writing'. There are some special verbs known as "compound verbs" that can express many [[grammatical aspect]]s such as [[Inchoative]], [[Durative]] etc., for example ''bada’a yulfitu nnażara'' means "It started to attract attention" which ''bada’a'' conveys the meaning of "to start doing something (in the past)"
* The two tenses can be used to express relative tense (or in an alternative view, grammatical aspect) when following other verbs in a [[serial verb]] construction.  In such a construction, the present tense indicates time simultaneous with the main verb, while the past tense indicates time prior to the main verb. (Or alternatively, the present tense indicates the [[imperfective aspect]] while the past tense indicates the [[perfective aspect]].)

In all but Form I, there is only one possible shape for each of the past and non-past stems for a given root.  In Form I, however, different verbs have different shapes.  Examples:
* {{lang|ar|كَتَبَ يَكْتُبُ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|&lt;u&gt;katab&lt;/u&gt;a ya&lt;u&gt;ktub&lt;/u&gt;u}}'' 'write'
* {{lang|ar|كَسِبَ يَكْسِبُ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|&lt;u&gt;kasab&lt;/u&gt;a ya&lt;u&gt;ksib&lt;/u&gt;u}}'' 'earn'
* {{lang|ar|قَرَأَ يَقْرَأُ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|&lt;u&gt;qaraʾ&lt;/u&gt;a ya&lt;u&gt;qraʾ&lt;/u&gt;u}}'' 'read'
* {{lang|ar|قَدِمَ يَقْدَمُ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|&lt;u&gt;qadim&lt;/u&gt;a ya&lt;u&gt;qdam&lt;/u&gt;u}}'' 'turn'
* {{lang|ar|كَبُرَ يَكْبُرُ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|&lt;u&gt;kabur&lt;/u&gt;a ya&lt;u&gt;kbur&lt;/u&gt;u}}'' 'become big, grow up'
Notice that the second vowel can be any of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a i u}}'' in both past and non-past stems.  The vowel ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'' occurs in most past stems, while ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'' occurs in some (especially [[intransitive]]) and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'' occurs only in a few [[stative]] verbs (i.e. whose meaning is 'be X' or 'become X' where X is an adjective).  The most common patterns are:
* past: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}''; non-past: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}''
* past: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'', non-past: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'' (when the second or third root consonant is a "guttural," i.e. one of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʾ ʿ h ḥ}}'')
* past: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}''; non-past: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}''
* past: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}''; non-past: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}''

=== Mood ===

There are three moods ({{lang|ar|حَالَات}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥālāt}}'', a word that also means "cases"; {{abbr|{{abbr|sg.|singular}}|singular}} {{wikt-lang|ar|حَالَة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥālah}}''), whose forms are derived from the imperfective stem: the [[indicative mood]] ({{wikt-lang|ar|مَرْفُوع}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|marfūʿ}}''), usually ending in ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}''; the [[subjunctive]] ({{wikt-lang|ar|مَنْصُوب}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|manṣūb}}''), usually ending in ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}''; and the [[Irrealis mood#Jussive|jussive]] ({{wikt-lang|ar|مَجْزُوم}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|majzūm}}''), with no ending. In less formal Arabic and in spoken dialects, the final vowels of the indicative and subjunctive are not pronounced, making them identical to jussive.

The [[Imperative mood|imperative]] ({{lang|ar|صِيغَة اَلْأَمْر}} ''{{transl|ar|ṣīghat al-amr}}'') (positive, only 2nd person) is formed by dropping the verbal prefix from the imperfective jussive stem, e.g. {{lang|ar|قَدِّم}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|qaddim}}'' 'present!'. If the result starts with two consonants followed by a vowel (''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}''), an [[Hamza#Hamzat waṣl|elidible {{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}]] is added to the beginning of the word, usually pronounced as "{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}", e.g. {{lang|ar|اِغْسِلْ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ighsil}}'' 'wash!' or {{lang|ar|اِفْعَل}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ifʿal}}'' 'do!' if the present form vowel is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'', then the alif is also pronounced as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'', e.g. {{lang|ar|أُكْتُب}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|uktub}}'' 'write!'. Negative imperatives are formed from the jussive.

The exception to the above rule is the form (or stem) IV verbs. In these verbs a non-elidible alif pronounced as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a-}}'' is always prefixed to the imperfect jussive form, e.g. {{lang|ar|أرسل}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|arsil}}'' "send!", {{lang|ar|أضف}} &lt;ref&gt;When a verb in Arabic ends with a vowel, the vowel is replaced with the corresponding short vocal when converted into imperative.&lt;/ref&gt;''{{transl|ar|ALA|aḍif}}'' 'add!'.

The subjunctive is used in subordinate clauses after certain conjunctions. The jussive is used in negation, in negative imperatives, and in the hortative ''{{transl|ar|ALA|li}}''+jussive. For example: 2. {{abbr|sg.|singular}} m.:
* imperfect indicative تفعلُ ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tafʿalu}}'' 'you are doing'
* subjunctive تفعلَ ''{{transl|ar|ALA|an tafʿala}}'' 'that you do'
* jussive لا تفعلْ ''{{transl|ar|ALA|lā tafʿal}}'' its meaning is dependent upon the prefix which attaches to it; in this case, it means 'may you do not do!'
* short energetic تفعلنْ ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tafʿalan}}'' its meaning is dependent upon the prefix which attaches to it; if the prefix is "li" it means 'you should do'
* long energetic تفعلنَّ ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tafʿalanna}}'' it has more emphasis than the short energetic, its meaning is dependent upon the prefix which attaches to it; if the prefix is "li" it means 'you must do'
* imperative افعل ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ifʿal}}'' 'do!'.

===Voice===

Arabic has two verbal [[grammatical voice|voices]] ({{lang|ar|صِيغَات}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sīghāt}}'' "forms", {{abbr|sg.|singular}} {{lang|ar|صِيغَة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sīghah}}''), [[active voice|active]] ({{lang|ar|صِيغَة اَلْمَعْلُوم}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ṣīghat al-maʿlūm}}''), and [[grammatical voice|passive]] ({{lang|ar|صِيغَة اَلْمَجْهُول}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ṣīghat al-majhūl}}''). The passive voice is expressed by a change in vocalization. For example:
*active {{lang|ar|فَعَلَ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|faʿala}}'' 'he did', {{lang|ar|يَفْعَلُ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yafʿalu}}'' 'he is doing'
*passive {{lang|ar|فُعِلَ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fuʿila}}'' 'it was done', {{lang|ar|يُفْعَلُ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yufʿalu}}'' 'it is being done'

Thus, the active and passive forms are spelled identically in Arabic; only their vowel markings differ.

===Participle===
Every verb has a corresponding active [[participle]], and most have passive participles. E.g. معلم ''{{transl|ar|ALA|muʿallim}}'' 'teacher' is the active participle to stem II. of the root علم ''{{transl|ar|ʿ-l-m}}'' ('know').
*The active participle to Stem I is فاعل ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fāʿil}}'', and the passive participle is مفعول ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mafʿūl}}''.
*Stems II–X take prefix مـ ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mu-}}'' and nominal endings for both the participles, active and passive. The difference between the two participles is only in the vowel between the last two root letters, which is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-i-}}'' for active and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-a-}}'' for passive (e.g. II. active مفعِّل ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mu-faʿʿil}}'', and passive مفعَّل ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mu-faʿʿal}}'').

===Verbal noun (maṣdar) &lt;span id="Masdar" &gt;&lt;/span&gt;===

In addition to a participle, there is a [[verbal noun]] (in Arabic, {{lang|ar|مَصْدَر}}  ''{{transl|ar|ALA|maṣdar}}'', {{abbr|pl.|plural}} {{lang|ar|مَصَادِر}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|maṣādir}}'', literally meaning 'source'), sometimes called a gerund, which is similar to [[English gerund]]s and verb-derived nouns of various sorts (e.g. "running" and "a run" from "to  run"; "objection" from "to object").  As shown by the English examples, its meaning refers both to the act of doing something and (by frequent semantic extension) to its result. One of its syntactic functions is as a verbal complement of another verb, and this usage it corresponds to the English gerund or infinitive (''He prevented me from '''running''''' or ''He began '''to run''''').
*verbal noun formation to stem I is irregular.
*the verbal noun to stem II is تفعيل ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tafʿīl}}''. For example: تحضير ''{{transl|ar|ALA|taḥḍīr}}'' 'preparation' is the verbal noun to stem II. of '''{{transl|ar|ḥ-ḍ-r}}''' ('to be present').
*stem III often forms its verbal noun with the feminine form of the passive participle, so for ساعد ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sāʿada}}'', 'he helped', produces the verbal noun مساعدة ''{{transl|ar|ALA|musāʿadah}}''. There are also some verbal nouns of the form فعال ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fiʿāl}}'': جاهد ''{{transl|ar|ALA|jāhada}}'', 'he strove', yields ''{{transl|ar|ALA|jihād}}'' جهاد 'striving' (for a cause or purpose).

Some well-known examples of verbal nouns are فتح ''{{transl|ar|fatḥ}}'' (see [[Fatah]]) (Form I), تنظيم ''[[Tanzim|{{transl|ar|tanẓīm}}]]'' (Form II), جهاد ''[[Jihad|{{transl|ar|jihād}}]]'' (Form III), إسلام ''[[Islām|{{transl|ar|islām}}]]'' (Form IV), انتفاضة ''[[:wikt:intifada|{{transl|ar|intifāḍah}}]]'' (feminine of Form VIII verbal noun), and استقلال ''[[istiqlal (disambiguation)|{{transl|ar|istiqlāl}}]]'' (Form X).

==Derivational categories, conjugations==
The system of [[verb conjugation]]s in Arabic is quite complicated, and is formed along two axes.  One axis, known as the ''form'' (described as "Form I", "Form II", etc.), is used to specify grammatical concepts such as [[causative]], [[intensive]], [[reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocal]], [[passive voice|passive]] or [[reflexive verb|reflexive]], and involves varying the stem form.  The other axis, known as the ''weakness'', is determined by the particular consonants making up the root.  For example, ''defective'' (or ''third-weak'') verbs have a و ''{{transl|ar|w}}'' or ي ''{{transl|ar|y}}'' as the last root consonant (e.g. رمي ''{{transl|ar|r-m-y}}'' 'throw', دعو ''{{transl|ar|d-ʿ-w}}'' 'call'), and ''doubled'' verbs have the second and third consonants the same (e.g. مدد ''{{transl|ar|m-d-d}}'' 'extend').  These "weaknesses" have the effect of inducing various irregularities in the stems and endings of the associated verbs.

Examples of the different forms of a sound verb (i.e. with no root weaknesses), from the root كتب ''{{transl|ar|k-t-b}}'' 'write' (using حمر ''{{transl|ar|ḥ-m-r}}'' 'red' for Form IX, which is limited to colors and physical defects):

==Conjugation==

=== Regular verb conjugation for person-number, tense-aspect-mood, and participles ===
In Arabic the [[grammatical person]] and [[grammatical number|number]] as well as the [[grammatical mood|mood]] are designated by a variety of prefixes and suffixes. The following table shows the paradigm of a regular sound Form I verb, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kataba}}'' ({{lang|ar|كتب}}) 'to write'.  Most of the final short vowels are often omitted in speech, except the vowel of the feminine plural ending ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-na}}'', and normally the vowel of the past tense second person feminine singular ending ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-ti}}''.

&lt;!-- Not clearly necessary to specify the Arabic word for "conjugation": {{lang|ar|اقتران}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|iqtirān}}'' --&gt;

The initial vowel in the imperative (which is elidable) varies from verb to verb, as follows:
* The initial vowel is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'' if the stem begins with two consonants and the next vowel is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ū}}''.
* The initial vowel is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'' if the stem begins with two consonants and the next vowel is anything else.
* There is no initial vowel if the stem begins with one consonant.

In unvocalised Arabic, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|katabtu}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|katabta}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|katabti}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|katabat}}'' are all written the same: {{lang|ar|كتبت}}. Forms ''{{transl|ar|ALA|katabtu}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|katabta}}'' (and sometimes even ''{{transl|ar|ALA|katabti}}'') can be abbreviated to ''{{transl|ar|ALA|katabt}}'' in spoken Arabic and in pausa, making them also sound the same.

{{lang|ar|ا}} ({{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}) in final {{lang|ar|ـُوا}} ({{transl|ar|ALA|-ū}}) is silent.

=== Weak roots ===
Roots containing one or two of the radicals و ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w}}'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}''), ي ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y}}'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|yāʾ}}'' ) or ء ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʾ}}'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'') often lead to verbs with special phonological rules because these radicals can be influenced by their surroundings. Such verbs are called "weak" (''verba infirma'', 'weak verbs') and their paradigms must be given special attention. In the case of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'', these peculiarities are mainly orthographical, since ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'' is not subject to elision (the orthography of ء ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'' and ا ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' is unsystematic due to confusion in early Islamic times). According to the position of the weak radical in the root, the root can be classified into four classes: ''first weak'', ''second weak'', ''third weak'' and ''doubled'', where both the second and third radicals are identical.  Some roots fall into more than one category at once.

==== Assimilated (first-weak) roots ====
Most first-weak verbs have a و {{transl|ar|w}} as their first radical.  These verbs are entirely regular in the past tense.  In the non-past, the {{transl|ar|w}} drops out, leading to a shorter stem (e.g. (وجد (يجد ''{{transl|ar|wajada (yajidu)}}'' 'to find'), where the stem is ـجدـ {{transl|ar|-jid-}} in place of a longer stem like ـجلدـ {{transl|ar|-jlid-}} from the verb (جلد (يجلد ''{{transl|ar|jalada (yajlidu)}}'' 'to whip, flog'.  This same stem is used throughout, and there are no other irregularities except for the imperative, which has no initial vowel, consistent with the fact that the stem for the imperative begins with only one consonant.

The are various types of assimilated (first-weak) Form I verbs:

All hollow (second-weak) verbs are conjugated in a parallel fashion.  The endings are identical to strong verbs, but there are two stems (a longer and a shorter) in each of the past and non-past.  The longer stem is consistently used whenever the ending begins with a vowel, and the shorter stem is used in all other circumstances.  The longer stems end in a long vowel plus consonant, while the shorter stems end in a short vowel plus consonant.  The shorter stem is formed simply by shortening the vowel of the long stem in ''all paradigms other than the active past of Form I verbs''.  In the active past paradigms of Form I, however, the longer stem always has an ''{{transl|ar|ā}}'' vowel, while the shorter stem has a vowel ''{{transl|ar|u}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|i}}'' corresponding to the actual second root consonant of the verb.

No initial vowel is needed in the imperative forms because the non-past stem does not begin with two consonants.

There are various types of Form I hollow verbs:
* (قال قلن (يقول يقلن ''{{transl|ar|qāla qulna (yaqūlu yaqulna)}}'' 'to say', formed from verbs with و ''{{transl|ar|w}}'' as their second root consonant and parallel to verbs of the (فعل (يفعل ''{{transl|ar|faʿala (yafʿulu)}}'' type
* (سار سرن (يسير يسرن ''{{transl|ar|sāra sirna (yasīru yasirna)}}'' 'to get going, to travel', formed from verbs with ي ''{{transl|ar|y}}'' as their second root consonant and parallel to verbs of the ''{{transl|ar|faʿala (yafʿilu)}}'' type
* (خاف خفن (يخاف يخفن ''{{transl|ar|khāfa khufna (yakhāfu yakhafna)}}'' 'to fear', formed from verbs with و ''{{transl|ar|w}}'' as their second root consonant and parallel to verbs of the (فعل (يفعل ''{{transl|ar|faʿila (yafʿalu)}}'' type
* (نام نمن (ينام ينمن ''{{transl|ar|nāma nimna (yanāmu yanamna)}}'' 'to sleep', formed from verbs with ي ''{{transl|ar|y}}'' as their second root consonant and parallel to verbs of the (فعل (يفعل ''{{transl|ar|faʿila (yafʿalu)}}'' type

The passive paradigm of all Form I hollow verbs is as follows:
* (قيل قلن (يقال يقلن ''{{transl|ar|qīla qilna (yuqālu yuqalna)}}'' 'to be said'

==== Defective (third-weak) roots ====

;Two stems each
Each of the two main stems (past and non-past) comes in two variants, a full and a shortened.  For the past stem, the full is رميـ ''{{transl|ar|ramay-}}'', shortened to رمـ ''{{transl|ar|ram-}}'' in much of the third person (i.e. before vowels, in most cases).  For the non-past stem, the full is ''{{transl|ar|rmiy-}}'', shortened to ''{{transl|ar|rm-}}'' before ''{{transl|ar|-ū -ī}}''.  The full non-past stem ـرميـ ''{{transl|ar|rmiy-}}'' appears as ـرميـ ''{{transl|ar|rmī-}}'' when not before a vowel; this is an automatic alternation in Classical Arabic.  The places where the shortened stems occur are indicated by silver (past), gold (non-past).

;Irregular endings
The endings are actually mostly regular.  But some endings are irregular, in boldface:
* Some of the third-person past endings are irregular, in particular those in رمى ''{{transl|ar|ram-ā}}'' 'he threw', رموا ''{{transl|ar|ram-aw}}'' 'they ({{abbr|masc.|masculine}}) threw'.  These simply have to be memorized.
* Two kinds of non-past endings are irregular, both in the "suffixless" parts of the paradigm (largely referring to singular masculine or singular combined-gender).  In the indicative, the full stem ـرمي ''{{transl|ar|-rmī}}'' actually appears normally; what is irregular is the lack of the ''{{transl|ar|-u}}'' normally marking the indicative.  In the jussive, on the other hand, the stem actually assumes a unique shortened form ـرمـ ''{{transl|ar|-rmi}}'', with a short vowel that is not represented by a letter in the Arabic.

===== (فعا (يفعو ''{{transl|ar|faʿā (yafʿū)}}'' =====
The following shows a paradigm of a typical Form I defective (third-weak) verb (دعا (يدعو ''{{transl|ar|daʿā (yadʿū)}}'' 'to call', parallel to verbs of the (فعل (يفعل ''{{transl|ar|faʿala (yafʿulu)}}'' type.  Verbs of this sort are entirely parallel to verbs of the (فعا (يفعي ''{{transl|ar|faʿā (yafʿī)}}'' type, although the exact forms can still be tricky.  See notes following the table for explanation.

Verbs of this sort are work nearly identically to verbs of the (فعى (يفعي ''{{transl|ar|faʿā (yafʿī)}}'' type.  There are the same irregular endings in the same places, and again two stems in each of the past and non-past tenses, with the same stems used in the same places:
* In the past, the full stem is دعوـ ''{{transl|ar|daʿaw-}}'', shortened to دعـ ''{{transl|ar|daʿ-}}''.
* In the non-past, the full stem is دعوـ ''{{transl|ar|dʿuw-}}'', rendered as دعوـ ''{{transl|ar|dʿū-}}'' when not before a vowel and shortened to دعـ ''{{transl|ar|dʿ-}}'' before ـُو، ـِي ''{{transl|ar|-ū -ī}}''.

The Arabic spelling has the following rules:
* In the third person masculine singular past, regular ا ''{{transl|ar|alif}}'' appears instead of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif maqṣūrah}}'': hence دَعَا ''not'' *دَعَى.
* The otiose final ''{{transl|ar|alif}}'' appears only after the final ''{{transl|ar|wāw}}'' of the plural, not elsewhere: hence تَدْعُو 'you ({{abbr|masc.|masculine}} {{abbr|sg.|singular}}) call ({{abbr|ind.|indicative}})' but تَدْعُوا 'you ({{abbr|masc.|masculine}} {{abbr|pl.|plural}}) call ({{abbr|subj.|subjunctive}})', even though they are both pronounced تدعو ''{{transl|ar|tadʿū}}''.

===== فعي يفعى ''{{transl|ar|faʿiya (yafʿā)}}'' =====

The following shows a paradigm of a typical Form I defective (third-weak) verb ''{{transl|ar|nasiya (yansā)}}'' 'to forget', parallel to verbs of the (فعل (يفعل ''{{transl|ar|faʿila (yafʿalu)}}'' type.  These verbs differ in a number of significant respects from either of the above types.

;Multiple stems
This variant is somewhat different from the variants with ـِي ''{{transl|ar|-ī}}'' or ـُو ''{{transl|ar|-ū}}'' in the non-past.  As with other third-weak verbs, there are multiple stems in each of the past and non-past, a full stem composed following the normal rules and one or more shortened stems.
* In this case, only one form in the past uses a shortened stem: نسوـ ''{{transl|ar|nas-ū}}'' 'they ({{abbr|masc.|masculine}}) forgot'.  All other forms are constructed regularly, using the full stem نسيـ ''{{transl|ar|nasiy-}}'' or its automatic pre-consonant variant نسيـ ''{{transl|ar|nasī-}}''.
* In the non-past, however, there are at least three different stems:
# The full stem نسيـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsay-}}'' occurs before ''{{transl|ar|-a/ā-}}'' or ـنـ ''{{transl|ar|-n-}}'', that is before dual endings, feminine plural endings and energetic endings corresponding to forms that are endingless in the jussive.
# The modified stem نساـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsā}}'' occurs in "endingless" forms (i.e. masculine or common-gender singular, plus 1st plural).  As usual with third-weak verbs, it is shortened to نسـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsa}}'' in the jussive.  These forms are marked with red.
# Before endings normally beginning with ''{{transl|ar|-i/ī-}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|-u/ū-}}'', the stem and endings combine together into a shortened form: e.g. expected تنسين ''{{transl|ar|*ta-nsay-īna}}'' 'you ({{abbr|fem.|feminine}} {{abbr|sg.|singular}}) forget', تنسيون ''{{transl|ar|*ta-nsay-ūna}}'' 'you ({{abbr|masc.|masculine}} {{abbr|pl.|plural}}) forget' instead become تنسين ''{{transl|ar|ta-nsayna}}'', تنسون ''{{transl|ar|ta-nsawna}}'' respectively.  The table above chooses to segment them as تنسين ''{{transl|ar|ta-nsa-yna}}'', تنسون ''{{transl|ar|ta-nsa-wna}}'', suggesting that a shortened stem ـنسـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsa-}}'' combines with irregular (compressed) endings ـين ''{{transl|ar|-yna}}'' &lt; ـين ''{{transl|ar|*-īna}}'', ـون ''{{transl|ar|-wna}}'' &lt; ـون ''{{transl|ar|*-ūna}}''.  Similarly subjunctive/jussive تنسوا ''{{transl|ar|ta-nsaw}}'' &lt; تنسيوا ''{{transl|ar|*ta-nsay-ū}}''; but note energetic تنسون ''{{transl|ar|ta-nsawunna}}'' &lt; تنسين ''{{transl|ar|*ta-nsay-unna}}'', where the original ـيـ ''{{transl|ar|*-yu-}}'' has assimilated to ـوـ ''{{transl|ar|-wu-}}''.  Consistent with the above analysis, we analyze this form as تنسون ''{{transl|ar|ta-nsa-wunna}}'', with an irregular energetic ending ـون ''{{transl|ar|-wunna}}'' where a [[glide consonant]] has developed after the previous vowel.  However, since all moods in this case have a form containing ـنسوـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsaw-}}'', an alternative analysis would consider ـنسوـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsaw}}'' and ـنسيـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsay}}'' as stems.  These forms are marked with gold.

;Irregular endings
The endings are actually mostly regular.  But some endings are irregular in the non-past, in boldface:
* The non-past endings in the "suffixless" parts of the paradigm (largely referring to singular masculine or singular combined-gender).  In the indicative and subjunctive, the modified stem ـنساـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsā}}'' appears, and is shortened to ـنسـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsa}}'' in the jussive.  In the forms actually appears normally; what is irregular is the lack of the ''{{transl|ar|-u}}'' normally marking the indicative.  In the jussive, on the other hand, the stem actually assumes a unique shortened form ـنسـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsa}}'', with a short vowel that is not represented by a letter in the Arabic script.
* In the forms that would normally have suffixes ''{{transl|ar|-i/ī-}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|-u/ū-}}'', the stem and suffix combine to produce ـنسيـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsay-}}'', ـنسوـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsaw-}}''.  These are analyzed here as consisting of a shortened stem form ـنسـ ''{{transl|ar|-nsa-}}'' plus irregular (shortened or assimilated) endings.

=== Doubled roots ===
The following shows a paradigm of a typical Form I doubled verb (مد (يمد ''{{transl|ar|madda (yamuddu)}}'' 'to extend', parallel to verbs of the (فعل (يفعل ''{{transl|ar|faʿala (yafʿulu)}}'' type.  See notes following the table for explanation.

All doubled verbs are conjugated in a parallel fashion.  The endings are for the most part identical to those of strong verbs, but there are two stems (a regular and a modified) in each of the past and non-past.  The regular stems are identical to the stem forms of sound verbs, while the modified stems have the two identical consonants pulled together into a [[geminate consonant]] and the vowel between moved before the geminate.  In the above verb (مد (يمد ''{{transl|ar|madda (yamuddu)}}'' 'to extend' (s.th.), the past stems are مددـ ''{{transl|ar|madad-}}'' (regular), مدـ ''{{transl|ar|madd-}}'' (modified), and the non-past stems are مددـ ''{{transl|ar|mdud-}}'' (regular), مدـ ''{{transl|ar|mudd-}}'' (modified).  In the table, places where the regular past stem occurs are in silver, and places where the regular non-past stem occurs are in gold; everywhere else, the modified stem occurs.

No initial vowel is needed in most of the imperative forms because the modified non-past stem does not begin with two consonants.

The concept of having two stems for each tense, one for endings beginning with vowels and one for other endings, occurs throughout the different kinds of weaknesses.

Following the above rules, endingless jussives would have a form like تمدد ''{{transl|ar|tamdud}}'', while the corresponding indicatives and subjunctives would have forms like تمد ''{{transl|ar|tamuddu}}'', تمد ''{{transl|ar|tamudda}}''.  As a result, for the doubled verbs in particular, there is a tendency to harmonize these forms by adding a vowel to the jussives, usually ''{{transl|ar|a}}'', sometimes ''{{transl|ar|i}}''.  These are the only irregular endings in these paradigms, and have been indicated in boldface.  The masculine singular imperative likewise has multiple forms, based on the multiple forms of the jussive.

The are various types of doubled Form I verbs:

== Formation of derived stems ("forms") ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]] [[Mujahideen]] --&gt;
Arabic verb morphology includes '''augmentations''' of the root, also known as '''forms''', an example of the [[derived stem]]s found among the Semitic languages.  For a typical verb based on a [[triliteral]] root (i.e. a root formed using three root consonants), the basic form is termed '''Form I''', while the augmented forms are known as '''Form II''', '''Form III''', etc.  The forms in normal use are Form I through Form X; Forms XI through XV exist but are rare and obsolescent.  Forms IX and XI are used only with adjectival roots referring to colors and physical defects (e.g. "red", "blue", "blind", "deaf", etc.), and are [[stative verb]]s having the meaning of "be X" or "become X" (e.g. Form IX ''{{transl|ar|iḥmarra}}'' 'be red, become red, blush', Form XI ''{{transl|ar|iḥmārra}}'' with the same meaning).  Although the ''structure'' that a given root assumes in a particular augmentation is predictable, its ''meaning'' is not (although many augmentations have one or more "usual" or prototypical meanings associated with them), and not all augmentations exist for any given root.  As a result, these augmentations are part of the system of [[derivational morphology]], not part of the inflectional system.

The construction of a given augmentation is normally indicated using the dummy root {{transl|ar|f–ʿ–l}} (ف–ع–ل), based on the verb ''{{transl|ar|faʿala}}'' 'to do'.  Because Arabic has no direct equivalent to the [[infinitive]] form of Western languages, the third-person masculine singular past tense is normally used as the ''[[dictionary form]]'' of a given verb, i.e. the form by which a verb is identified in a dictionary or grammatical discussion.  Hence, the word ''{{transl|ar|faʿala}}'' above actually has the meaning of 'he did', but is translated as 'to do' when used as a dictionary form.

Verbs based on [[quadriliteral]] roots (roots with four consonants) also exist.  There are four augmentations for such verbs, known as Forms Iq, IIq, IIIq and IVq.  These have forms similar to Forms II, V, VII and IX respectively of triliteral verbs.  Forms IIIq and IVq are fairly rare.  The construction of such verbs is typically given using the dummy verb ''{{transl|ar|faʿlala}}''.  However, the choice of this particular verb is somewhat non-ideal in that the third and fourth consonants of an actual verb are typically not the same, despite the same consonant used for both; this is a particular problem e.g. for Form IVq.  The verb tables below use the dummy verb ''{{transl|ar|faʿlaqa}}'' instead.

Some grammars, especially of colloquial spoken varieties rather than of Classical Arabic, use other dummy roots.  For example, ''A Short Reference Grammar of Iraqi Arabic'' (Wallace M. Erwin) uses  فمل ''{{transl|ar|FaMaLa}}'' and فستل ''{{transl|ar|FaSTaLa}}'' for three and four-character roots, respectively (standing for "First Middle Last" and "First Second Third Last").  Commonly the dummy consonants are given in capital letters.

The system of identifying verb augmentations by [[Roman numeral]]s is an invention by Western scholars.  Traditionally, Arabic grammarians did not number the augmentations at all, instead identifying them by the corresponding dictionary form.  For example, Form V would be called "the ''{{transl|ar|tafaʿʿala}}'' form".

Each form can have either active or passive forms in the past and non-past tenses, so reflexives are different from passives.

Note that the present passive of forms I and IV are the same. Otherwise there is no confusion.

===Sound verbs===
'''Sound verbs''' are those verbs with no associated irregularities in their constructions.  Verbs with irregularities are known as ''weak verbs''; generally, this occurs either with (1) verbs based on roots where one or more of the consonants (or ''radicals'') is ''{{transl|ar|w}}'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}'', و), ''{{transl|ar|y}}'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|yāʾ}}'', ي) or the [[glottal stop]] ''{{transl|ar|ʾ}}'' (''[[hamzah]]'', ﺀ); or (2) verbs where the second and third root consonants are the same.

Some verbs that would be classified as "weak" according to the consonants of the verb root are nevertheless conjugated as a strong verb.  This happens, for example:
*Largely, to all verbs whose only weakness is a hamzah radical; the irregularity is in the Arabic spelling but not the pronunciation, except in a few minor cases.
*Largely, to all verbs whose only weakness is a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y}}'' in the first radical (the "assimilated" type).
*To all verbs conjugated in Forms II, III, V, VI whose only weakness is a و ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w}}'' or ي ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y}}'' in the first or second radicals (or both).

===Form VIII assimilations===
Form VIII has a ـتـ -''t''- that is [[infix]]ed into the root, directly after the first root consonant.  This ـتـ -''t''- [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilates]] to certain [[coronal consonant]]s occurring as the first root consonant.  In particular, with roots whose first consonant is د، ز، ث، ذ، ص، ط، ض، ظ ''d z th dh ṣ ṭ ḍ ẓ'', the combination of root and infix ت ''t'' appears as دّ، زد، ثّ، ذّ، صط، طّ، ضط، ظّ ''dd zd thth dhdh ṣṭ ṭṭ ḍṭ ẓẓ''.  That is, the ''t'' assimilates the emphasis of the [[emphatic consonant]]s ص، ط، ض، ظ ''ṣ ṭ ḍ ẓ'' and the [[voicing (phonetics)|voicing]] of د، ز ''d z'', and assimilates entirely to the [[interdental]] consonants ث، ذ، ظ ''th dh ẓ''.  The consonant cluster ضط ''ḍṭ'', as in اضطرّ ''{{transl|ar|iḍṭarra}}'' 'compel, force', is unexpected given modern pronunciation, having a voiced stop next to a voiceless one; this reflects the fact that ط ''{{transl|ar|ṭ}}'' was formerly pronounced voiced, and ض ''{{transl|ar|ḍ}}'' was pronounced as the emphatic equivalent not of د ''{{transl|ar|d}}'' but of an unusual [[lateral consonant|lateral]] sound. (ض ''{{transl|ar|ḍ}}'' was possibly an emphatic [[voiced alveolar lateral fricative]] {{IPA|/ɮˤ/}} or a similar [[affricate]]d sound {{IPA|/dɮˤ/}} or {{IPA|/dˡˤ/}}; see the article on the letter ض ''[[ḍād]]''.)

===Defective (third-weak) verbs===
Other than for Form I active, there is only one possible form for each verb, regardless of whether the third root consonant is و ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w}}'' or ي ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y}}''.  All of the derived third-weak verbs have the same active-voice endings as (فعى (يفعي ''{{transl|ar|ALA|faʿā (yafʿī)}}'' verbs except for Forms V and VI, which have past-tense endings like (فعى (يفعي ''{{transl|ar|ALA|faʿā (yafʿī)}}'' verbs but non-past endings like (فعي (يفعى ''{{transl|ar|ALA|faʿiya (yafʿā)}}'' verbs.  The passive-voice endings of all third-weak verbs (whether Form I or derived) are the same as for the (فعي (يفعى ''{{transl|ar|ALA|faʿiya (yafʿā)}}'' verbs.  The verbal nouns have various irregularities: feminine in Form II, ''-in'' declension in Form V and VI, glottal stop in place of root ''w/y'' in Forms VII–X.

The active and passive participles of derived defective verbs consistently are of the ''-in'' and ''-an'' declensions, respectively.

Defective Form IX verbs are extremely rare.  Heywood and Nahmad list one such verb, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|iʿmāya}}'' 'be/become blind', which does not follow the expected form اعميّ ''{{transl|ar|ALA|*iʿmayya}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Possibly, اعماي ''{{transl|ar|ALA|iʿmāya}}'' is contracted from اعميي ''{{transl|ar|ALA|*iʿmayaya}}'' using the same process that produces hollow verbs.  ''A dictionary of modern written Arabic'' (Hans Wehr, J. Milton Cowan) also lists a supposed Form IX defective verb ارعوى ''{{transl|ar|ALA|irʿawā}}'' 'desist (from sin), repent, see the light'; however, this has both an unexpected form and meaning, so it is unclear whether the classification as Form IX is accurate.&lt;/ref&gt; They also list a similarly rare Form XI verb اعمايّ ''{{transl|ar|ALA|iʿmāyya}}'' 'be/become blind' — this time with the expected form.

===Assimilated (first-weak) verbs===
When the first radical is ''w'', it drops out in the Form I non-past.  Most of the derived forms are regular, except that the sequences ''uw iw'' are assimilated to ''ū ī'', and the sequence ''wt'' in Form VIII is assimilated to ''tt'' throughout the paradigm.  The following table only shows forms with irregularities in them.

The initial ''w'' also drops out in the common Form I verbal noun ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʿilah}}'' (e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ṣilah}}'' 'arrival, link' from ''{{transl|ar|ALA|waṣalah}}'' 'arrive').

===Hamzated verbs===
The largest problem with so-called "hamzated" verbs (those with a glottal stop ''ʾ'' or "[[hamzah]]" as any of the root consonants) is the complicated way of writing such verbs in the Arabic script (see the article on [[hamzah]] for the rules regarding this).  In pronunciation, these verbs are in fact almost entirely regular.

The only irregularity occurs in verbs with a hamzah as the first radical.  A phonological rule in Classical Arabic disallows the occurrence of two hamzahs in a row separated by a short vowel, assimilating the second to the preceding vowel (hence ''ʾaʾ ʾiʾ ʾuʾ'' become ''ʾā ʾī ʾū'').  This affects the following forms:
*The first-person singular of the non-past of Forms I, IV and VIII.
*The entire past and imperative of Form IV.

In addition, any place where a ''{{transl|ar|hamzat al-waṣl}}'' (elidable hamzah) occurs will ''optionally'' undergo this transformation.  This affects the following forms:
*The entire imperative of Form I.
*The entire past and imperative of Form VIII, as well as the verbal noun of Form VIII.

There are the following irregularities:
*The common verbs ''{{transl|ar|ʾakala}}'' 'eat', ''{{transl|ar|ʾakhadha}}'' 'take', ''{{transl|ar|ʾamara}}'' 'command' have irregular, short imperatives ''{{transl|ar|kul, khudh, mur}}''.
*Form VIII of the common verb ''{{transl|ar|ʾakhadha}}'' 'take' is ''{{transl|ar|ittakhadha}}'' 'take on, assume', with irregular assimilation of the hamzah.
*The common verb ''{{transl|ar|saʾala yasʾalu}}'' 'ask' has an alternative non-past ''{{transl|ar|yasalu}}'' with missing hamzah.

===Doubly weak verbs===
Doubly weak verbs have two "weak" radicals; a few verbs are also triply weak.  Generally, the above rules for weak verbs apply in combination, as long as they do not conflict.  The following are cases where two types of weaknesses apply in combination:
*Verbs with a ''w'' in the first radical and a ''w'' or ''y'' in the third radical.  These decline as defective (third-weak) verbs, and ''also'' undergo the loss of ''w'' in the non-past of Form I, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|waqā yaqī}}'' 'guard', ''{{transl|ar|wafā yafī}}'' 'complete, fulfill (a promise)', ''{{transl|ar|waliya yalī}}'' 'be near, follow'.  These verbs have extremely short imperatives ''{{transl|ar|qi fi li}}''  (feminine ''{{transl|ar|qī fī lī}}'', masculine plural ''{{transl|ar|qū fū lū}}'', feminine plural ''{{transl|ar|iqna ifna ilna}}''), although these are not normally used in [[Modern Standard Arabic]].  Similarly, verbs of this sort in Form IV and Form VIII are declined as defective but also have the normal assimilations of ''w''-initial verbs, e.g. Form IV ''{{transl|ar|awfā yūfī}}'' 'fulfill a vow', Form VIII ''{{transl|ar|ittaqā yattaqī}}'' 'fear (God)', augmentations of ''{{transl|ar|wafā yafī}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|waqā yaqī}}'', respectively (see above).
*Verbs with a hamzah in the first radical and a ''w'' or ''y'' in the third radical.  These decline as defective (third-weak) verbs, and ''also'' undergo the assimilations associated with the initial hamzah, e.g. the common verb ''{{transl|ar|ʾatā yaʾtī}}'' 'come' (first singular non-past ''{{transl|ar|ʾātī}}'' 'I come') and the related Form IV verb ''{{transl|ar|ʾātā yuʾtī}}'' 'bring' (first singular non-past ''{{transl|ar|ʾūtī}}'' 'I bring').

The following are examples where weaknesses would conflict, and hence one of the "weak" radicals is treated as strong:
*Verbs with a ''w'' or ''y'' in both the second and third radicals.  These are fairly common, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|rawā yarwī}}'' 'recount, transmit'.  These decline as regular defective (third-weak) verbs; the second radical is treated as non-weak.
*Verbs with a ''w'' in the first radical and the second and third radicals the same.  These verbs do ''not'' undergo any assimilations associated with the first radical, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|wadda (wadidtu) yawaddu}}'' 'to love'.
*Verbs with a hamza in the first radical and the second and third radicals the same.  These verbs do ''not'' undergo any assimilations associated with the first radical, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ʾajja yaʾujju}}'' 'burn', first singular non-past ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʾujju}}'' 'I burn', despite the two hamzahs in a row.

The following are cases with special irregularities:
*Verbs with a ''w'' or ''y'' in the second radical and a hamzah in the third radical.  These are fairly common, e.g. the extremely common verb ''{{transl|ar|jāʾa yajīʾu}}'' 'come'.  The only irregularity is the Form I active participle, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|jāʾin}}'' 'coming', which is irregularly declined as a defective (third-weak) participle (presumably to avoid a sequence of two hamzahs in a row, as the expected form would be ''*{{transl|ar|jāʾiʾ}}'').
*The extremely common verb ''{{transl|ar|raʾā yarā}}'' 'see'.  The hamzah drops out entirely in the non-past.  Similarly in the passive, ''{{transl|ar|ruʾiya yurā}}'' 'be seen'.  The active participle is regular ''{{transl|ar|rāʾin}}'' and the passive participle is regular ''{{transl|ar|marʾīy-}}''.  The related Form IV verb ''{{transl|ar|arā yūrī}}'' 'show' is missing the hamzah throughout.  Other augmentations are regular: Form III ''{{transl|ar|rāʾā yurāʾī}}'' 'dissemble', Form VI ''{{transl|ar|tarāʾā yatarāʾā}}'' 'look at one another', Form VIII ''{{transl|ar|irtaʾā yartaʾī}}'' 'think'.
*The common verb ''{{transl|ar|ḥayiya yaḥyā}}'' 'live', with an alternative past tense ''{{transl|ar|ḥayya}}''.  Form IV ''{{transl|ar|aḥyā yuḥyī}}'' 'resuscitate, revive' is regular.  Form X ''{{transl|ar|istaḥyā yastaḥyī}}'' 'spare alive, feel ashamed' also appears as ''{{transl|ar|istaḥayya}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|istaḥā}}''.

==Verbs in colloquial Arabic==

The Classical Arabic system of verbs is largely unchanged in the colloquial spoken [[varieties of Arabic]].  The same [[derivational morphology|derivational]] system of augmentations exists, including [[triliteral]] Forms I through X and [[quadriliteral]] Forms I and II, constructed largely in the same fashion (the rare triliteral Forms XI through XV and quadriliteral Forms III and IV have vanished).  The same system of weaknesses (strong, defective/third-weak, hollow/second-weak, assimilated/first-weak, doubled) also exists, again constructed largely in the same fashion.  Within a given verb, two stems (past and non-past) still exist along with the same two systems of affixes (suffixing past-tense forms and prefixing/suffixing non-past forms).

The largest changes are within a given paradigm, with a significant reduction in the number of forms.  The following is an example of a regular verb paradigm in [[Egyptian Arabic]].

This paradigm shows clearly the reduction in the number of forms:
*The thirteen person/number/gender combinations of Classical Arabic have been reduced to eight, through the loss of dual and feminine-plural forms. (Some varieties still have feminine-plural forms, generally marked with the suffix ''-an'', leading to a total of ten forms.  This occurs, for example, in [[Iraqi Arabic]] and in many of the varieties of the [[Arabian peninsula]].)
*The system of suffix-marked mood distinctions has been lost, other than the imperative.  [[Egyptian Arabic]] and many other "urban" varieties (e.g. [[Moroccan Arabic]], [[Levantine Arabic]]) have non-past endings ''{{transl|ar|-i -u}}'' inherited from the original subjunctive forms, but some varieties (e.g. [[Iraqi Arabic]]) have ''{{transl|ar|-īn -ūn}}'' endings inherited from the original indicative.  Most varieties have also gained new moods, and a new future tense, marked through the use of prefixes (most often with an unmarked subjunctive vs. an indicative marked with a prefix, e.g. Egyptian ''bi-'', Levantine ''b-'', Moroccan ''ta-/ka-'').  Various particles are used for the future (e.g. Egyptian ''ḥa-'', Levantine ''raḥ-'', Moroccan ''ɣa(di)-''), derived from reduced forms of various verbs.
*The internal passive is lost almost everywhere.  Instead, the original [[reflexive verb|reflexive]]/[[mediopassive]] augmentations (e.g. Forms V, VI, VII) serve as both reflexive and passive.  The passive of Forms II and III is generally constructed with a reflex of Forms V and VI, using a prefix ''it-'' derived from the Classical prefix ''ta-''.  The passive of Form I uses either a prefix ''in-'' (from Form VII) or ''it-'' (modeled after Forms V and VI).  The other forms often have no passive.

In addition, Form IV is lost entirely in most varieties, except for a few "classicizing" verbs (i.e. verbs borrowed from [[Modern Standard Arabic]]).

See [[varieties of Arabic]] for more information on grammar differences in the spoken varieties.

Ashéninka (Ashéninca, Ashéninga) is the name that some [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] included in the Ashéninka-Asháninka [[Dialect continuum|dialect complex]] have traditionally received, which belongs to the [[Campa languages|Kampan]] branch of the [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]] family&lt;ref name=Pedrós2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pedrós |first1=Toni |title=Ashéninka y asháninka: ¿de cuántas lenguas hablamos? |journal=Cadernos de etnolingüística |date=2018 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1-30 |url=http://www.etnolinguistica.org/article:vol6n1p1-30 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Ethnologue]] distinguishes seven languages throughout the whole complex, while Pedrós&lt;ref name=Pedrós2018/&gt; proposes a division in three languages (Ashéninka, [[Asháninka]] and Northern Ashé-Ashá) based on the principle of mutual intelligibility. The varieties included in Ashéninka and Northern Ashé-Ashá have traditionally been called ''Ashéninka''. The Glottolog reflects Pedrós’ proposal, although considering the languages proposed by him as groupings of the languages that the Ethnologue distinguishes.

According to the indigenous peoples database of the Peruvian Ministry of Education,&lt;ref name=BDPIO/&gt; there are 13,496 people living in Ashéninka communities, of whom 9,881 (73%) claim to be able to speak the language. The Ethnologue gives much higher figures for the different Ashéninka varieties.

The classification of the different varieties was first established by David Payne in his Apurucayali Axininca grammar,&lt;ref name=Payne1981&gt;{{cite book|last1=Payne|first1=David L.|title=The Phonology and Morphology of Axininca Campa|date=1981|publisher=Summer Institute of Linguistics|location=Dallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he referred to them as dialects and not as different languages.&lt;ref name=Payne1981/&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

Ashéninka is a locally official language in Peru, as are all [[Languages of Peru|native Peruvian languages]]. It and its relatives are also known by the largely pejorative term ''Campa''.

Ashéninka was recognized as a separate language from Asháninka in 2017, and the process to fix an alphabet was underway during 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Urpia participará del primer taller de normalización del alfabeto Ashéninka |url=https://www.gacetaucayalina.com/2018/04/urpia-participara-del-primer-taller-de-normalizacion-del-alfabeto-asheninka-1.html |accessdate=6 September 2018 |publisher=Gaceta Ucayalina |date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Minedu exhibe alfabetos oficiales y materiales educativos en lenguas originarias |url=https://andina.pe/agencia/noticia-minedu-exhibe-alfabetos-oficiales-y-materiales-educativos-lenguas-originarias-710896.aspx |accessdate=6 September 2018 |agency=Andina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">'''Atresia''' is a condition in which an [[body orifice|orifice]] or passage in the body is (usually abnormally) closed or absent.

Examples of atresia include:
* [[Biliary atresia]], a condition in newborns in which the common bile duct between the liver and the small intestine is blocked or absent.&lt;ref name=pubmed2&gt;{{cite web|last=Zieve|first=David|title=Biliary atresia|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002130/|publisher=PubMed Health|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Choanal atresia]], blockage of the back of the nasal passage, usually by abnormal bony or soft tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zieve|first=David|title=Choanal atresia|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002608/|publisher=Pubmed Health|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Esophageal atresia]], which affects the alimentary tract and causes the esophagus to end before connecting normally to the stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dugdale|first=David|title=Esophageal atresia|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001957/|publisher=PubMed Health|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Imperforate anus]], malformation of the opening between the rectum and anus.&lt;ref name=pubmed1&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaneshiro|first=Neil|title=Imperforate Anus|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002132/|publisher=PubMed Health|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Intestinal atresia]], malformation of the intestine, usually resulting from a vascular accident in utero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intestinal atresia|url=http://www.pedisurg.com/pteduc/intestinal_atresia.htm|publisher=Pedisurg|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Microtia]], absence of the ear canal or failure of the canal to be tubular or fully formed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonilla|first=Arthuro|title=Microtia: Congenital ear deformity Institute|url=http://www.microtia.net/|publisher=Congenital ear deformity Institute|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (can be related to [[Microtia]], a congenital deformity of the pinna, or outer ear).
* [[Ovarian follicle atresia]], the degeneration and subsequent resorption of one or more immature [[ovarian follicle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kaipia | first1 = A. | last2 = Hsueh | first2 = A.

* [[Potter sequence]], congenital decreased size of the kidney leading to absolutely no functionality of the kidney, usually related to a single kidney.
* [[Pulmonary atresia]], malformation of the pulmonary valve in which the valve orifice fails to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schumacher|first=Kurt|title=Pulmonary atresia|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002082/|publisher=PubMed Health|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Renal agenesis]], only having one kidney.
* [[Tricuspid atresia]], a form of congenital heart disease whereby there is a complete absence of the tricuspid valve, and consequently an absence of the right atrioventricular connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tricuspid atresia|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002100/|publisher=PubMed Health|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vaginal atresia]], a congenital occlusion of the vagina or subsequent adhesion of the walls of the vagina, resulting in its occlusion.

In the early 20th century, Russell led the British "revolt against [[British idealism|idealism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Russell and G.&amp;nbsp;E. Moore broke themselves free from British [[Idealism]] which, for nearly 90 years, had dominated British philosophy. Russell would later recall in "My Mental Development" that "with a sense of escaping from prison, we allowed ourselves to think that grass is green, that the sun and stars would exist if no one was aware of them ..."—Russell B, (1944) "My Mental Development", in Schilpp, Paul Arthur: ''The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell'', New York: Tudor, 1951, pp. 3–20.&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]] along with his predecessor [[Gottlob Frege]], colleague [[G.&amp;nbsp;E.

==Biography==

===Early life and background===
[[File:Bertrand Russell in 1876.jpg|thumb|upright|Russell as a four-year-old]]
[[File:Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park.jpg|thumb|Childhood home, [[Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park|Pembroke Lodge]]]]

Bertrand Russell was born on 18 May 1872 at Ravenscroft, [[Trellech]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], into an influential and liberal family of the [[British aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Hook, "Lord Russell and the War Crimes Trial", ''Bertrand Russell: critical assessments'', Vol. 1, edited by A. D. Irvine, New York 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;178&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, [[John Russell, Viscount Amberley|Viscount]] and [[Katharine Russell, Viscountess Amberley|Viscountess Amberley]], were radical for their times. Lord Amberley consented to his wife's affair with their children's tutor, the biologist [[Douglas Spalding]]. Both were early advocates of [[birth control]] at a time when this was considered scandalous.&lt;ref name="calicut"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Ashley|title=Bertrand Russell: The Man and His Ideas.|url=http://www.geocities.com/vu3ash/index.html|accessdate=28 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501064331/http://www.geocities.com/vu3ash/index.html|archivedate=1 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Amberley was an [[atheist]] and his atheism was evident when he asked the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] to act as Russell's secular godfather.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand and Perkins, Ray (ed.) ''Yours faithfully, Bertrand Russell''. Open Court Publishing, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill died the year after Russell's birth, but his writings had a great effect on Russell's life.

His paternal grandfather, the [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Earl Russell]], had been asked twice by [[Queen Victoria]] to form a government, serving her as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in the 1840s and 1860s.&lt;ref name="John R"&gt;{{cite web| last = Bloy| first = Marjie, PhD| title = Lord John Russell (1792–1878)| url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/pms/russell.html| accessdate =28 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russells had been prominent in England for several centuries before this, coming to power and the [[peerage]] with the rise of the [[Tudor dynasty]] (see: [[Duke of Bedford]]). They established themselves as one of the leading British [[British Whig Party|Whig]] families, and participated in every great political event from the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1536–1540 to the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688–1689 and the [[Great Reform Act]] in 1832.&lt;ref name="John R"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peerage"&gt;Cokayne, G.

Reprint in 6 volumes, Gloucester, UK: Alan Sutton Publishing, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Amberley was the daughter of [[Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley|Lord]] and [[Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley|Lady Stanley of Alderley]].&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt; Russell often feared the ridicule of his maternal grandmother,&lt;ref name=Booth&gt;{{cite book|first=Wayne C.|last=Booth|title=Modern Dogma and the Rhetoric of Assent|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1974|isbn=0226065723}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 December 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; one of the campaigners for [[education of women]].&lt;ref&gt;The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866–1928 By Elizabeth Crawford&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and adolescence===
Russell had two siblings: brother [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell|Frank]] (nearly seven years older than Bertrand), and sister Rachel (four years older). In June 1874 Russell's mother died of [[diphtheria]], followed shortly by Rachel's death. In January 1876, his father died of [[bronchitis]] following a long period of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] paternal grandparents, who lived at [[Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park|Pembroke Lodge]] in [[Richmond Park]]. His grandfather, former Prime Minister [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Earl Russell]], died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the [[Frances Russell, Countess Russell|Countess Russell]] (née Lady Frances Elliot), was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calicut"/&gt;

The countess was from a Scottish [[Presbyterian]] family, and successfully petitioned the [[Court of Chancery]] to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting [[Darwinism]] and supporting [[Home Rule|Irish Home Rule]]), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on [[social justice]] and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life. (One could challenge the view that Bertrand stood up for his principles, based on his own well-known quotation: "I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong".) Her favourite Bible verse, "Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 23:2), became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression, and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.

Russell's adolescence was very lonely, and he often contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in religion and mathematics, and that only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=38|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at home by a series of tutors.&lt;ref name="nobel prize"&gt;The Nobel Foundation (1950). [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1950/russell-bio.html Bertrand Russell: The Nobel Prize in Literature 1950]. Retrieved 11 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When Russell was eleven years old, his brother Frank introduced him to the work of [[Euclid]], which transformed his life.&lt;ref name="calicut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greeks"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lenz, John R.|title=Bertrand Russell and the Greeks|url=http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1443&amp;context=russelljournal|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During these formative years he also discovered the works of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. In his autobiography, he writes: "I spent all my spare time reading him, and learning him by heart, knowing no one to whom I could speak of what I thought or felt, I used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know Shelley, and to wonder whether I should meet any live human being with whom I should feel so much sympathy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=35|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell claimed that beginning at age 15, he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of [[Dogma#In religion|Christian religious dogma]], which he found very unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP4FDLegX9s|title=1959 Bertrand Russell CBC interview|year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this age, he came to the conclusion that there is no [[free will]] and, two years later, that there is no life after death. Finally, at the age of 18, after reading Mill's ''Autobiography'', he abandoned the "[[First Cause]]" argument and became an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|chapter=2: Adolescence|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/4833 |title=Bertrand Russell on God |year=1959 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=8 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126090302/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/4833 |archivedate=26 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He traveled to the continent in 1890 with an American friend, [[Edward FitzGerald (mountaineer)|Edward FitzGerald]], and with FitzGerald's family he visited the [[Paris Exhibition of 1889]] and was able to climb the [[Eiffel Tower]] soon after it was completed.&lt;ref name=Russell1967a&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1872–1914 |year=1967 |edition=2000 |url={{Google books|dVBpAwAAQBAJ|page=39|plainurl=y}} |page=39 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University and first marriage===
[[File:Portrait of Bertrand Russell in 1893.jpg|thumb|Russell at Trinity College in 1893]]
Russell won a scholarship to read for the [[Mathematical Tripos]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and commenced his studies there in 1890,&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=RSL890BA|name=Russell, the Hon. Bertrand Arthur William}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking as coach [[Robert Rumsey Webb]]. He became acquainted with the younger [[George Edward Moore]] and came under the influence of [[Alfred North Whitehead]], who recommended him to the [[Cambridge Apostles]]. He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as seventh [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] in the former in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.&lt;ref name="Whitehead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Whitehead.html|title=Alfred North Whitehead|accessdate=8 November 2007|last=O'Connor|first=J.

Russell was 17&amp;nbsp;years old in the summer of 1889 when he met the family of [[Alys Pearsall Smith]], an American [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] five years older, who was a graduate of [[Bryn Mawr College]] near [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=Russell1967b&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1872–1914 |year=1967 |edition=2000 |url={{Google books|dVBpAwAAQBAJ|page=72|plainurl=y}} |page=72 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monk1996&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk |first=Ray |title=Bertrand Russell: The Spirit of Solitude, 1872–1921 |url={{Google books|AzssomBIDRIC|page=37|plainurl=y}} |year=1996 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-684-82802-2 |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family &amp;ndash; they knew him primarily as "Lord John's grandson" and enjoyed showing him off.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

He soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13&amp;nbsp;December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while he was cycling, that he no longer loved her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=I went out bicycling one afternoon, and suddenly, as I was riding along a country road, I realised that I no longer loved Alys|title=Autobiography|page=150|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he did not. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage. A lengthy period of separation began in 1911 with Russell's affair with [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]],&lt;ref name="the Journal of the Bertrand Russell Archives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1353&amp;context=russelljournal&amp;sei-redir=1|title=Bertrand Russell Meets His Muse: The Impact of Lady Ottoline Morrell (1911–12)|accessdate=1 March 2012|last=Moran|first=Margaret|year=1991|publisher=McMaster University Library Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he and Alys finally divorced in 1921 to enable Russell to remarry.&lt;ref name="Russell2002"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Griffin |editor-first=Nicholas |last=Russell |first=Bertrand

During his years of separation from Alys, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including Morrell and the actress [[Lady Constance Malleson]].&lt;ref name="private"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newcriterion.com:81/archive/11/sept92/brussell.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205032455/http://newcriterion.com/archive/11/sept92/brussell.htm |archivedate=5 December 2006 |title=Love, logic &amp; unbearable pity: The private Bertrand Russell |accessdate=15 November 2007 |last=Kimball |first=Roger |work=The New Criterion |volume=11 |issue=1 |date=September 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with [[Vivienne Haigh-Wood]], the English governess and writer, and first wife of [[T.

===Early career===
[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Russell in 1907]]
Russell began his published work in 1896 with ''German Social Democracy'', a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory. In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name="LSE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/aboutLSE/keyFacts/nobelPrizeWinners/russell.aspx|title=London School of Economics|website=Lse.ac.uk|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].&lt;ref name="LettersPg16"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|editor=Ray Perkins|title=Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell: Letters to the Editor 1904–1969|year=2001|publisher=Open Court Publishing|location=Chicago|isbn=0-8126-9449-X|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EayyTTpXL-QC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16|accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He now started an intensive study of the [[foundations of mathematics]] at Trinity.
In 1898 he wrote ''An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry'' which discussed the [[Cayley–Klein metric]]s used for [[non-Euclidean geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1898) ''An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry'', p.&amp;nbsp;32, re-issued 1956 by [[Dover Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;
He attended the [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in Paris in 1900 where he met [[Giuseppe Peano]] and [[Alessandro Padoa]].  The Italians had responded to [[Georg Cantor]], making a science of [[set theory]]; they gave Russell their literature including the [[Formulario mathematico]]. Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon [[Russell's paradox]]. In 1903 he published ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'', a work on foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of [[logicism]], that mathematics and logic are one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1950/russell-bio.html|title=Bertrand Russell, biography|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a "sort of mystic illumination", after witnessing [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s wife's acute suffering in an [[Angina pectoris|angina]] attack. "I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty ... and with a desire almost as profound as that of the [[Buddha]] to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable", Russell would later recall. "At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|chapter=6: Principia Mathematica|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 he wrote the essay "[[On Denoting]]", which was published in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''. Russell was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1908|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1908]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt; The three-volume ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', written with Whitehead, was published between 1910 and 1913. This, along with the earlier ''The Principles of Mathematics'', soon made Russell world-famous in his field.

In 1910 he became a [[University of Cambridge]] lecturer at Trinity College where he studied. He was considered for a Fellowship, which would give him a vote in the college government and protect him from being fired for his opinions, but was passed over because he was "anti-clerical", essentially because he was agnostic. He was approached by the Austrian engineering student [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who became his PhD student. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various [[phobia]]s and his frequent bouts of despair. This was often a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' in 1922.&lt;ref name="Wittgenstein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/history/rvw001.htm|title=Russell on Wittgenstein|publisher=Rbjones.com|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell delivered his lectures on [[Logical Atomism]], his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of [[World War I]]. Wittgenstein was, at that time, serving in the Austrian Army and subsequently spent nine months in an Italian [[prisoner of war]] camp at the end of the conflict.

===First World War===
During World War I, Russell was one of the few people to engage in active [[opposition to World War I|pacifist activities]] and in 1916, because of his lack of a Fellowship, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Hochschild|first = Adam|year = 2011|title = I Tried to Stop the Bloody Thing|periodical = The American Scholar|url = http://www.theamericanscholar.org/i-tried-to-stop-the-bloody-thing/|accessdate =10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later described this as an illegitimate means the state used to violate freedom of expression, in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]]. Russell played a significant part in the ''Leeds Convention'' in June 1917, a historic event which saw well over a thousand "anti-war socialists" gather; many being delegates from the [[Independent Labour Party]] and the Socialist Party, united in their pacifist beliefs and advocating a peace settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scharfenburger|first=Paul|title=1917|url=http://musicandhistory.com/music-and-history-by-the-year/178-1917.html|publisher=MusicandHistory.com|date=17 October 2012|accessdate=7 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117062625/http://musicandhistory.com/music-and-history-by-the-year/178-1917.html|archivedate=17 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international press reported that Russell appeared with a number of Labour [[Member of Parliament|MPs]], including [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Philip Snowden]], as well as former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP and anti-conscription campaigner, Professor [[Arnold Lupton]].  After the event, Russell told [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] that, "to my surprise, when I got up to speak, I was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=Pacifism and Revolution |page=xxxiv |chapter=A Summer of Hope |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Socialists – Peace Terms Discussed|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15731745|date=5 June 1917|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trinity incident resulted in Russell being fined £100, which he refused to pay in hope that he would be sent to prison, but his books were sold at auction to raise the money. The books were bought by friends; he later treasured his copy of the [[King James Version|King James Bible]] that was stamped "Confiscated by Cambridge Police".

A later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the US to enter the war on the United Kingdom's side resulted in six months' imprisonment in [[Brixton (HM Prison)|Brixton prison]] (see ''[[Bertrand Russell's views on society]]'') in 1918.&lt;ref name="Pacifist"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bertrand Russell and the Pacifists in the First World War|last=Vellacott|first=Jo|isbn=0-85527-454-9|publisher=Harvester Press|location=Brighton|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said of his imprisonment:

{{quote|I found prison in many ways quite agreeable. I had no engagements, no difficult decisions to make, no fear of callers, no interruptions to my work. I read enormously; I wrote a book, "Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy"... and began the work for "Analysis of Mind"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|chapter=8: The First War|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Russell was reinstated to Trinity in 1919, resigned in 1920, was Tarner Lecturer 1926 and became a Fellow again in 1944 until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Trinity College|url=https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/historical-overview/trinity-in-literature/|title=Trinity in Literature|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Bertrand again gained press attention when attending a "banquet" in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] with well-known campaigners, including [[Arnold Lupton]], who had been a [[Members of Parliament|Member of Parliament]] and had also endured imprisonment for "passive resistance to military or naval service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M.

===G. H. Hardy on the Trinity controversy and Russell's personal life===
In 1941, [[G. H. Hardy]] wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled ''Bertrand Russell and Trinity'' &amp;ndash; published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by [[C. D. Broad]] &amp;ndash; in which he gave an authoritative account about Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life. Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision. The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing from October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in China and Japan. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation.

The reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage. Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it, since this would have been an "unusual application" and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy. Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered due to Russell's resignation since the ‘world of learning’ knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed. In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the ''Tarner Lectures'' on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best received books according to Hardy: ''The Analysis of Matter'', published in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bertrand Russell and Trinity|author=G. H. Hardy|pages=57–8|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to the Trinity pamphlet, Hardy wrote:

{{quote|I wish to make it plain that Russell himself is not responsible, directly or indirectly, for the writing of the pamphlet ... I wrote it without his knowledge and, when I sent him the typescript and asked for his permission to print it, I suggested that, unless it contained misstatement of fact, he should make no comment on it. He agreed to this ... no word has been changed as the result of any suggestion from him.}}

===Between the wars===
In August 1920, Russell travelled to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="FreeLib"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertrand Russell (1872–1970)|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|url=http://russell.thefreelibrary.com/|accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a four-part series of articles, titled "Soviet Russia{{emdash}}1920", for the US magazine ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;ref name="nation1"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Nation-1920jul31-00121 |title=Soviet Russia{{emdash}}1920 |magazine=The Nation |date=31 July 1920 |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |pages=121–125 |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sov1920"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/lenin-trotzky-and-gorky/ |title=Lenin, Trotzky and Gorky |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |work=The Nation |date=20 February 2008 |orig-year=First published 1920 |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[Vladimir Lenin]] and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin disappointing, sensing an "impish cruelty" in him and comparing him to "an opinionated professor". He cruised down the [[Volga]] on a steamship. His experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution. He wrote a book ''The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism''&lt;ref name="Practice &amp;"&gt;Russell, Bertrand [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17350 The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism by Bertrand Russell], 1920&lt;/ref&gt; about his experiences on this trip, taken with a group of 24 others from the UK, all of whom came home thinking well of the régime, despite Russell's attempts to change their minds. For example, he told them that he heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure these were clandestine executions, but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[File:Russell with John and Kate.jpg|thumb|left|Russell with his children, [[John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell|John]] and [[Lady Katharine Tait|Kate]]]]
Russell's lover [[Dora Russell|Dora Black]], a British author, [[feminist]] and socialist campaigner, visited Russia independently at the same time; in contrast to his reaction, she was enthusiastic about the revolution.&lt;ref name="Practice &amp;" /&gt;

The following autumn Russell, accompanied by Dora, visited [[Beijing|Peking]] (as it was then known in the West) to lecture on philosophy for a year.&lt;ref name="nobel prize"/&gt; He went with optimism and hope, seeing China as [[History of the Republic of China#Fight against warlordism and the First United Front|then being]] on a new path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand|title=The Problem of China|date=1972|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location=London|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars present in China at the time included [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref name="pneumonia"/&gt; and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], the Indian Nobel-laureate poet.&lt;ref name="nobel prize"/&gt; Before leaving China, Russell became gravely ill with [[pneumonia]], and [[List of premature obituaries|incorrect reports]] of his death were published in the Japanese press.&lt;ref name="pneumonia"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bertrand Russell Reported Dead|work=The New York Times|date=21 April 1921|accessdate=11 December 2007|format=PDF|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/04/21/107014047.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the couple visited Japan on their return journey, Dora took on the role of spurning the local press by handing out notices reading "Mr. Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists".&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;{{cite book|title=Uncertain Paths to Freedom: Russia and China, 1919–22|work=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell|volume=15|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-415-09411-9|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|editor=Richard A.

We don't use irony (fundamentally, because it interferes with consistently clearly stating the verifiable facts). It is also unlikely that even BR's use of it in this circumstance, even if verifiable as his words, rises above chit-chat and to the level of being worthy of mention as a *notable* utterance or opinion of his.}}

Dora was six months pregnant when the couple returned to England on 26 August 1921. Russell arranged a hasty divorce from Alys, marrying Dora six days after the divorce was finalised, on 27 September 1921. Russell's children with Dora were [[John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell]], born on 16 November 1921, and [[Lady Katharine Tait|Katharine Jane Russell]] (now Lady Katharine Tait), born on 29 December 1923. Russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of [[physics]], ethics, and education to the layman.

From 1922 to 1927 the Russells divided their time between London and [[Cornwall]], spending summers in [[Porthcurno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|page=386|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general elections]] Russell stood as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate in the [[Chelsea (UK Parliament constituency)|Chelsea constituency]], but only on the basis that he knew he was extremely unlikely to be elected in such a safe Conservative seat, and he was not on either occasion.

Together with Dora, Russell founded the experimental Beacon Hill School in 1927. The school was run from a succession of different locations, including its original premises at the Russells' residence, Telegraph House, near [[Harting]], West Sussex. On 8 July 1930 Dora gave birth to her third child Harriet Ruth. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.&lt;ref name="Beacon"&gt;Inside Beacon Hill: Bertrand Russell as Schoolmaster.

On a tour through the US in 1927 Russell met Barry Fox (later [[Barry Stevens (therapist)|Barry Stevens]]) who became a well-known [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt therapist]] and writer in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Kranz, D. (2011): [http://www.gestalt.de/kranz_stevens_leben.html Barry Stevens: Leben Gestalten]. In: Gestaltkritik, 2/2011, p.&amp;nbsp;4-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell and Fox developed an intensive relationship. In Fox's words: "... for three years we were very close."&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, B. (1970): Don't Push the River. Lafayette, Cal. (Real People Press), p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt; Fox sent her daughter Judith to Beacon Hill School for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Gorham, D.

(1981): Recent Acquisitions: Correspondence, in: Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies, Vol 1, Iss. 1, Article 6,  43 – 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell.

Russell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American journalist, Griffin Barry.&lt;ref name="Dora"/&gt; They separated in 1932 and finally divorced. On 18 January 1936, Russell married his third wife, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] undergraduate named [[Patricia Russell (nee Spence)|Patricia ("Peter") Spence]], who had been his children's governess since 1930. Russell and Peter had one son, [[Conrad Russell, 5th Earl Russell|Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell]], 5th Earl Russell, who became a prominent historian and one of the leading figures in the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] party.&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;

Russell returned to the [[London School of Economics]] to lecture on the science of power in 1937.&lt;ref name="LSE" /&gt;

During the 1930s, Russell became a close friend and collaborator of [[V. K. Krishna Menon]], then secretary of the India League, the foremost lobby in the United Kingdom for Indian self-rule.{{vague|date=July 2014|reason= was Menon *at that point* AIML sec'y, or was it BR who *later* became sec'y?}}

===Second World War===
Russell opposed rearmament against [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1937 he wrote in a personal letter: "If the Germans succeed in sending an invading army to England we should do best to treat them as visitors, give them quarters and invite the commander and chief to dine with the prime minister."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/02/19/museum-of-tolerance-acquires-bertrand-russells-nazi-appeasement-letter/ |title=Museum Of Tolerance Acquires Bertrand Russell’s Nazi Appeasement Letter |website=Losangeles.cbslocal.com |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, he changed his view that avoiding a full-scale world war was more important than defeating Hitler. He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy. In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare: "War was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand, "The Future of Pacifism", The American Scholar, (1943) 13: 7–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=I found the Nazis utterly revolting – cruel, bigoted, and stupid.

Before World War II, Russell taught at the [[University of Chicago]], later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy]]. He was appointed professor at the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY) in 1940, but after a public outcry the appointment was annulled by a court judgment that pronounced him "morally unfit" to teach at the college due to his opinions, especially those relating to [[sexual morality]], detailed in ''[[Marriage and Morals]]'' (1929).

Russell soon joined the [[Barnes Foundation]], lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy; these lectures formed the basis of ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]''. His relationship with the eccentric [[Albert C. Barnes]] soon soured, and he returned to the UK in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of Trinity College.&lt;ref name="professor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertrand Russell |url=http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophers/bertrand-russell.php |year=2006 |accessdate=17 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212100048/http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophers/bertrand-russell.php |archivedate=12 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===

Russell participated in many broadcasts over the BBC, particularly ''[[The Brains Trust]]'' and the [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]], on various topical and philosophical subjects. By this time Russell was world-famous outside academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer opinions on a wide variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in [[Trondheim]], Russell was one of 24 survivors (among a total of 43 passengers) of an [[Bukken Bruse disaster|aeroplane crash in Hommelvik]] in October 1948. He said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane.&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell|page=660|publisher=Routledge|author=Griffin, Nicholas (ed.)|year=2002|isbn=0-415-26012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=512|isbn=9780415189859|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) became a best-seller and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life.

In 1942 Russell argued in favour of a moderate socialism, capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles, in an inquiry on [[dialectical materialism]], launched by the Austrian artist and philosopher [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in his journal ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'', saying "I think the metaphysics of both [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]] plain nonsense – Marx's claim to be 'science' is no more justified than [[Mary Baker Eddy]]'s. This does not mean that I am opposed to socialism."&lt;ref&gt;Russell to Edward Renouf, assistant of [[Wolfgang Paalen]], 23 March 1942 (Succession Wolfgang Paalen, Berlin); this letter is cited in ''DYN'', No. 2, Mexico, July–August 1942, p.&amp;nbsp;52&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Russell expressed support for [[Zionism]]: "I have come gradually to see that, in a dangerous and largely hostile world, it is essential to [[Jews]] to have some country which is theirs, some region where they are not suspected aliens, some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Quote/Russell_On_Zionism.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040128/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Quote/Russell_On_Zionism.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in 1948, Russell said that if the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] than before it possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atom bombs on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouth.edu/department/history-philosophy/files/2012/10/Bertrand-Russell-and-Preventive-War.pdf |title=Bertrand Russell and Preventive War |format=PDF |website=Plymouth.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/books/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=699582|work=The Economist|title=A philosopher's letters&amp;nbsp;– Love, Bertie | date=21 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, only the United States possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in Eastern Europe which were being absorbed into the Soviet Union's [[sphere of influence]]. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a [[first strike]] in a war with the USSR, including [[Nigel Lawson]], who was present when Russell spoke of such matters. Others, including Griffin, who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="letters" /&gt;
However, just after the atomic bombs exploded over [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], Russell wrote letters, and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948, stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the USSR using atomic bombs while the United States possessed them and before the USSR did. In September 1949, one week after the USSR tested its first A-bomb, but before this became known, Russell wrote that USSR would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following Stalin's purges only science based on Marxist principles would be practiced in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote: "There is reason to think Stalin will insist on a new orthodoxy in atomic physics, since there is much in quantum theory that runs contrary to Communist dogma. An atomic bomb' made on Marxist principles would probably not explode because, after all, Marxist science was that of a hundred years ago. For those who fear the military power of Russia there is, therefore, some reason to rejoice in the muzzling of Russian science." Russell, Bertrand "Stalin Declares War on Science"&amp;nbsp; Review of Langdon-Davies,&amp;nbsp;''Russia Puts Back the Clock'',&amp;nbsp;''Evening Standard''&amp;nbsp;(London), Sep 7 1949, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt; After it became known that the USSR carried out [[List of nuclear weapons tests of the Soviet Union|its nuclear bomb tests]], Russell declared his position advocating for the total abolition of atomic weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bertrand-Russell-Ronald-William-Clark/dp/0394490592/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=undefined&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=clark+life+bertrand+russell|title=The life of Bertrand Russell: Ronald William Clark: 9780394490595: Amazon.com: Books|publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Russell was invited by the BBC to deliver the inaugural [[Reith Lectures]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=–06:04|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00729d9|title=Radio 4 Programmes – The Reith Lectures|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—what was to become an annual series of lectures, still broadcast by the BBC. His series of six broadcasts, titled ''Authority and the Individual'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=–06:04|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lz3|title=Radio 4 Programmes – The Reith Lectures: Bertrand Russell: Authority and the Individual: 1948|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored themes such as the role of individual initiative in the development of a community and the role of state control in a progressive society. Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to ''Words and Things'' by [[Ernest Gellner]], which was highly critical of the later thought of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and of [[ordinary language philosophy]]. [[Gilbert Ryle]] refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', which caused Russell to respond via ''[[The Times]]''. The result was a month-long correspondence in ''The Times'' between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;T. P. Uschanov, [http://www.helsinki.fi/~tuschano/writings/strange/ The Strange Death of Ordinary Language Philosophy]. The controversy has been described by the writer [[Ved Mehta]] in ''Fly and the Fly Bottle'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[King's Birthday Honours]] of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38628 |supp=y|page=2796|date=3 June 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nobel prize"/&gt; When he was given the Order of Merit, [[George VI]] was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird, saying, "You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted".&lt;ref&gt;Ronald W. Clark, Bertrand Russell and His World, p.&amp;nbsp;94. (1981) {{isbn|0-500-13070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply "That's right, just like your [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|brother]]" immediately came to mind. In 1952 Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother).

In 1950, Russell attended the inaugural conference for the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], a [[C.I.A.]]-funded anti-communist organization committed to the deployment of culture as a weapon during the [[Cold War]]&lt;ref&gt;Frances Stonor Saunders, "The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters." New York Press, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;. Russell was one of the best known patrons of the Congress, until he resigned in 1956&lt;ref&gt; Frances Stonor Saunder, ""The Cultural Cold War: The CIA And the World of Arts and Letters." New York Press, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell married his fourth wife, [[Edith Finch Russell|Edith Finch]], soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, sharing a house for 20 years with Russell's old friend [[Lucy Donnelly]]. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son John suffered from serious [[mental illness]], which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and his former wife Dora.

In September 1961, at the age of 89, Russell was jailed for seven days in [[HM Prison Brixton|Brixton Prison]] for "breach of peace" after taking part in [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)#1961|an anti-nuclear demonstration]] in London. The magistrate offered to exempt him from jail if he pledged himself to "good behaviour", to which Russell replied: "No, I won't."&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation, ''Bertrand Russell, 1872–1970'' [1970], p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, Vol. 3|page=157|publisher=Little, Brown|author=Russell, Bertrand|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 Russell played a public role in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis#Crisis deepens|Cuban Missile Crisis]]: in an exchange of telegrams with Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Khrushchev assured him that the Soviet government would not be reckless.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=World Peace Efforts Since Gandhi|author=Sanderson Beck|accessdate=24 June 2012|url=http://www.san.beck.org/GPJ24-Russell,Muste.html|chapter=Pacifism of Bertrand Russell and A. J. Muste|publisher=Sanderson Beck|year=2003–2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell sent this telegram to [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;YOUR ACTION DESPERATE. THREAT TO HUMAN SURVIVAL. NO CONCEIVABLE JUSTIFICATION. CIVILIZED MAN CONDEMNS IT. WE WILL NOT HAVE MASS MURDER. ULTIMATUM MEANS WAR... END THIS MADNESS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kennedys: Dynasty and Disaster|author=John H. Davis|publisher=S. P. Books|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to historian Peter Knight, after JFK's [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]], Russell, "prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a Who Killed Kennedy Committee in June 1964, members of which included [[Michael Foot]] MP, [[Caroline Benn]], the publisher [[Victor Gollancz]], the writers [[John Arden]] and [[J. B. Priestley]], and the Oxford history professor [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]." Russell published a highly critical article weeks before the [[Warren Commission]] Report was published, setting forth ''16 Questions on the Assassination'' and equating the Oswald case with the [[Dreyfus affair]] of late 19th-century France, in which the state wrongly convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticised the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Knight, ''The Kennedy Assassination'', Edinburgh University Press Ltd., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political causes===
[[File:Bertrand Russell leads anti-nuclear march in London, Feb 1961.jpg|thumb|left|Russell (centre) alongside his wife Edith, leading a [[CND]] anti-nuclear march in London, 18 February 1961]]
Bertrand Russell was opposed to war from early on, his opposition to World War I being used as grounds for his dismissal from Trinity College at Cambridge. This incident fused two of his most controversial causes, as he had failed to be granted Fellow status, which would have protected him from firing, because he was not willing to either pretend to be a devout Christian, or at least avoid admitting he was agnostic.

He later described the resolution of these issues as essential to freedom of thought and expression, citing the incident in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]], where he explained that the expression of any idea, even the most obviously "bad", must be protected not only from direct State intervention, but also economic leveraging and other means of being silenced:

{{quote|The opinions which are still persecuted strike the majority as so monstrous and immoral that the general principle of toleration cannot be held to apply to them.

But this is exactly the same view as that which made possible the tortures of the Inquisition.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44932/44932-h/44932-h.htm Free Thought and Official Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Russell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to [[nuclear disarmament]] and opposing the [[Vietnam War]]. The 1955 [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]] was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time.&lt;ref name="Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Einstein Manifesto|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_russelleinstein_manif.html|author=Russell, Bertrand|author2=[[Albert Einstein]] |date=9 July 1955|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966–1967, Russell worked with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and many other intellectual figures to form the [[Russell Tribunal|Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal]] to investigate the conduct of the United States in Vietnam.  He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period.

In 1956, immediately before and during the [[Suez Crisis]], Russell expressed his opposition to European imperialism in the Middle East. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of the  pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the [[Suez Canal]] area "where general interest is involved". At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets "because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating". Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which [[Michael Polanyi]] had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had already entered Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'' (Psychology Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], urging a summit to consider "the conditions of co-existence". Khrushchev responded that peace could indeed be served by such a meeting. In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in ''[[The Observer]]'', proposing a cessation of all nuclear-weapons production, with the UK taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear-weapons program if necessary, and with Germany "freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West". US Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] replied for Eisenhower. The exchange of letters was published as ''The Vital Letters of Russell, Khrushchev, and Dulles''.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;''Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell'' (pp. 212–213)&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was asked by ''[[The New Republic]]'', a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace. He urged that all nuclear-weapons testing and constant flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]], with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power. He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the [[Oder-Neisse line]] as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in Central Europe, consisting at the minimum of Germany, Poland, [[Hungary]], and [[Czechoslovakia]], with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone. In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing [[Arab nationalism]], and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard Israel's frontiers to ensure that Israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it. He also suggested Western recognition of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]].&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;

He was in contact with [[Lionel Rogosin]] while the latter was filming his anti-war film ''[[Good Times, Wonderful Times]]'' in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the [[New Left]]. In early 1963, in particular, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the [[Vietnam War]], and felt that the US government's policies there were near-[[genocide|genocidal]]. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the [[Jerusalem Prize]], an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society.&lt;ref name="jerusalem prize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalembookfair.com/main.html|title=Jerusalem International Book Fair|publisher=Jerusalembookfair.com|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to Israel and the [[Arab world|Arab countries]] to accept an [[arms embargo]] and international supervision of nuclear plants and rocket weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1964/02/26/archive/bertrand-russell-appeals-to-arabs-and-israel-on-rocket-weapons|title=Bertrand Russell Appeals to Arabs and Israel on Rocket Weapons|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1965 he tore up his [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] card because he suspected [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government was going to send troops to support the United States in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;

===Final years and death===
In June 1955 Russell had leased Plas Penrhyn in [[Penrhyndeudraeth]], Merionethshire, Wales and on 5 July of the following year it became his and Edith's principal residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Andrew G.

[[File:Bust Of Bertrand Russell-Red Lion Square-London.jpg|thumb|Bust of Russell in [[Red Lion Square]]]]
Russell published his three-volume autobiography in 1967, 1968, and 1969. Russell made a [[cameo appearance]] playing himself in the anti-war [[Hindi]] film [[Aman (film)|''Aman'']], by [[Mohan Kumar]], which was released in India in 1967. This was Russell's only appearance in a feature film.&lt;ref name="Bertrand Russell in Bollywood"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233193/|title=Aman (1967)|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 1969 he wrote to ''The Times'' newspaper saying that the preparation for show trials in [[Czechoslovakia]] was "highly alarming". The same month, he appealed to Secretary General [[U Thant]] of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the United States in [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. The following month, he protested to [[Alexei Kosygin]] over the expulsion of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] from the [[Soviet Union of Writers]].

On 31 January 1970 Russell issued a statement condemning "Israel's aggression in the Middle East", and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the [[War of Attrition]]. He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-[[Six-Day War]] borders. This was Russell's final political statement or act. It was read out at the International Conference of Parliamentarians in [[Cairo]] on 3 February 1970, the day after his death.&lt;ref name="Last Message"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.connexions.org/CxLibrary/Docs/CX5576-RussellMidEast.htm |title=Bertrand Russell's Last Message |website=Connexions.org |date=1970-01-31 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell died of [[influenza]] on 2 February 1970 at his home in Penrhyndeudraeth. His body was cremated in [[Colwyn Bay]] on 5 February 1970. In accordance with his will, there was no religious ceremony; his ashes were scattered over the Welsh mountains later that year. He left an estate valued at £69,423 (£1.09 million or US$1.4 million in 2018 money).&lt;ref&gt;[https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/Calendar?surname=Russell&amp;yearOfDeath=1970&amp;page=3#calendar Russell, 1970, p.&amp;nbsp;3] at probatesearch.service.gov.uk.

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Bertrand Russell's philosophical views}}
Russell is generally credited with being one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]]. He was deeply impressed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716), and wrote on every major area of philosophy except [[aesthetics]]. He was particularly prolific in the field of [[metaphysics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Logic and philosophy of mathematics|logic and the philosophy of mathematics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Philosophy of language|philosophy of language]], [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Ethics|ethics]] and [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Epistemology|epistemology]]. When [[Brand Blanshard]] asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, "but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Blanshard, in [[Paul Arthur Schilpp]], ed., ''The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard'', Open Court, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;88, quoting a private letter from Russell.&lt;/ref&gt;

On ethics, Russell considered himself a [[utilitarian]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell'', London: Routledge, 2000 [London: Allen and Unwin, 1969, Vol. 1], p.&amp;nbsp;39 ("It appeared to me obvious that the happiness of mankind should be the aim of all action, and I discovered to my surprise that there were those who thought otherwise. Belief in happiness, I found, was called Utilitarianism, and was merely one among a number of ethical theories. I adhered to it after this discovery.").&lt;/ref&gt;

For the advancement of science ''and'' protection of the right to freedom of expression, Russell advocated [[The Will to Doubt]], the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess, that one should always remember:

{{quote|''None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error''. The methods of increasing the degree of truth in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate. These methods are practised in science, and have built up the body of scientific knowledge.

''Every man of science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the progress of discovery; nevertheless, it is near enough to the truth to serve for most practical purposes, though not for all. In science, where alone something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found, men’s attitude is tentative and full of doubt''.}}

===Religion===
Russell described himself in 1947 as an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], saying: "Therefore, in regard to the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympic gods]], speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], I should, I think, take exactly the same line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm |title=Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic? |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |year=1947 |work=Encyclopedia of Things |accessdate=6 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622001026/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm |archivedate=22 June 2005 |df=dmy }}: "I never know whether I should say "Agnostic" or whether I should say "Atheist"... As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove (sic) that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist..."&lt;/ref&gt; For most of his adult life, Russell maintained religion to be little more than [[superstition]] and, in spite of any positive effects, largely harmful to people. He believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency, and to be responsible for much of our world's wars, oppression, and misery. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the [[British Humanist Association]] and President of Cardiff Humanists until his death.&lt;ref&gt;'Humanist News', March 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society===
{{Main|Bertrand Russell's views on society}}
Political and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes.

Russell argued for a "scientific society", where war would be abolished, population growth would be limited, and prosperity would be shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Impact of Science on Society|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|chapter=Conclusions|year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested the establishment of a "single supreme world government" able to enforce peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Which Way to Peace? ''(Part 12)''|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=173|publisher=M. Joseph Ltd.|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that "the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Society in Ethics and Politics|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=212|publisher=London: G. Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was an active supporter of the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]], being one of the signatories of [[A. E. Dyson]]'s 1958 letter to ''The Times'' calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive.&lt;ref name="GALHA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesbian and Gay Rights: The Humanist and Religious Stances|url=http://www.galha.org/briefing/lgb_rights.html|author=Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association|date=2 November 1997|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday" ("Postscript" in his ''Autobiography''), Russell wrote: "I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1944–1969|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=330|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1968}} Published separately as 'Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday' in ''Portraits from Memory''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was the author of more than sixty books and over two thousand articles.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Pigden in Bertrand Russell, ''Russell on Ethics: Selections from the Writings of Bertrand Russell'', Routledge (2013), p.&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James C. Klagge, ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he wrote many pamphlets, introductions, and letters to the editor. One pamphlet titled, '''I Appeal unto Caesar': The Case of the Conscientious Objectors'', ghostwritten for Margaret Hobhouse, the mother of imprisoned peace activist [[Stephen Hobhouse]], allegedly helped secure the release from prison of hundreds of [[conscientious objector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |title=To end all wars: a story of loyalty and rebellion, 1914–1918 |pages=270–272 |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2011 |isbn=0-618-75828-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works can be found in anthologies and collections, including ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'', which [[McMaster University]] began publishing in 1983. By March 2017 this collection of his shorter and previously unpublished works included 18 volumes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russell.mcmaster.ca/brworks.htm |title=McMaster University: The Bertrand Russell Research Centre |website=Russell.mcmaster.ca |date=2017-03-06 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several more are in progress. A bibliography in three additional volumes catalogues his publications. The Russell Archives held by McMaster's [[William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections]] possess over 40,000 of his letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertrand Russell Archives Catalogue Entry and Research System|url=https://bracers.mcmaster.ca/|website=McMaster University Library|publisher=The William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boris Sandler''' ({{lang-yi|באָריס סאַנדלער}}; born January 6, 1950 in [[Beltz]]) is a Yiddish-language [[author]], [[journalist]], [[playwright]] and [[lyricist]] and the former 
[[Newspaper editor|editor]] of the [[Yiddish]] edition of the ''[[The Forward|Forward]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Boris Sandler Retires as Editor of Yiddish Forward|date=9 Mar 2016|work=[[The Forward]]|url=http://forward.com/news/335537/boris-sandler-retires-as-editor-of-yiddish-forward/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Life/Career Beginnings ==

Boris Sandler was born in 1950 in '''[[Bălți]]''', Bessarabia (Yiddish: Beltz, today: Moldova), where he was raised among [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|Holocaust survivors]] and their children in a Yiddish-speaking milieu which would inspire many characters and scenes in his later literary works. From his parents and neighbors, mostly former residents of [[Shtetl|small towns and villages]] who had moved to larger cities after the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], he learned the native folk traditions of [[History of the Jews in Bessarabia|Jewish Bessarabia]] along with its rich Yiddish dialect.  

Sandler began studying music at the age of five, eventually enrolling in a music conservatory. He worked as a professional violinist for a decade, including seven years playing with the Moldovan State Orchestra. He took a two-year hiatus from his musical career, however, in order to study literature as part of a group of Yiddish and other minority-language writers who attended the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute|Gorky Literature Institute]] in Moscow for graduate studies. There in 1981 Sandler was among the first cohort of Yiddish writers and poets to study Yiddish literature at the graduate level in the USSR since Stalin's [[Night of the Murdered Poets|purge of Yiddish writers and educational institutions in the late 1940s.]] He made his literary debut that same year in the USSR's state-sponsored Yiddish literary journal [[Sovetish Heymland]], where he would later serve on the journal's editorial board. His first collection of short fiction, ''Stairway to a Miracle'', was published in 1986.  

==Final Years in Moldova/Move to Israel==
In 1989 Sandler became the host and lead producer of the first regularly-appearing Yiddish-language television show ''On the Jewish Street,'' which aired for several years on Moldovan television. During this period Sandler created two Yiddish-language documentary films, "Where is My Home" and "Don't Give Up Yiddish!" about Moldovan Jewish life. Sensing that most of the community would soon [[1990s Post-Soviet aliyah|leave for Israel]], he used the documentaries as a way to preserve the memories of Bessarabian Jewry at a time of great upheaval. From 1990 until 1992 Sandler was also the editor of the Yiddish section of the [[Chișinău]]-based newspaper ''Our Voice''.  

Sandler moved to Israel in 1992, where he soon became active in the local community of Yiddish writers and journalists, contributing articles to the Yiddish press, working in a publishing house and at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] where he assisted in the cataloging of interwar Yiddish periodicals. In addition to his work as the executive director of Leivick House Publishing, Sandler published a children's magazine ''Kind un Keyt.'' During this period three of Sandler's books appeared in Israel; the novella ''Case Number 5390'' (1992) and the short story collections ''The Old Well'' (1994) and ''Gates'' (1997).

==Immigration to America/Editor of the Yiddish Forward==

In 1998 Sandler moved to New York to begin working at the Yiddish edition of [[The Forward]]. After the unexpected death of editor-in-chief [[Mordechai Strigler]] several months later Sandler took over the newspaper, adding an international lineup of new contributors and training two generations of new Yiddish journalists. Sandler also expanded [[The Forward]]'s literary offerings, publishing new works by esteemed writers of the older generation including Abraham Karpinowitz,Yekhiel Shraybman, Zvi Eisenmann, [[Michael Lev|Misha Lev,]] [[Rivka Basman Ben-Hayim]], Tsvi Kanar, Moyshe Shklar, Yente Mash, Chaim Beider and younger writers such as [[Mikhoel Felsenbaum]], Boris Kotlerman, Moishe Lemster, Emil Kalin and [[Evgeny Kissin]]. Additionally, Sandler oversaw the production of several thousand hours of [[The Forward]]'s weekly Yiddish radio show, and produced a dozen CDs of Yiddish music and audio books, which were released under the aegis of [[The Forward]]. During this period several of Sandler's novels appeared as serials in the paper.   

Besides his work as a writer and editor Sandler also produced a series of twelve documentary films about the lives of Yiddish writers. Most of these films, released between 2009 and 2016, were based on interviews conducted in the late 1990s, when the last generation of Yiddish writers who came of age before World War II were still active in Israel. Additionally he oversaw the launch of the newspaper's Youtube channel. 

==Retirement from Yiddish Forward/Yidish Branzhe==

Sandler retired from the Yiddish Forward in 2016 after 18 years as editor-in-chief. He continues to publish his own fiction as well as the works of others in the online publication [https://yiddishbranzhe.com/ Yidish Branzhe], which he founded and edits.  

==Literary Style/Influences/Themes==

While most of Sandler's fiction takes place in the post-war Bessarabia of his youth his subject matter ranges from historical novels about the [[Kishinev pogrom|Kishenev Pogrom]] and novellas about [[the Holocaust]] to portrayals of immigrant Jewish life in Israel and New York and even occasional science fiction. In addition to strong influences from classic Yiddish writers such as [[Sholem Aleichem]] and modernist Yiddish writers such as [[David Bergelson]] Sandler's fiction often incorporates elements of [[Magic realism]]. Among Sandler's frequent themes are [[Transgenerational trauma|intergenerational trauma resulting from the Holocaust]], the effect of totalitarian political regimes on the lives of artists and writers, the fate of Yiddish language and culture in the 21st century and the impact of immigration on multigenerational families.

Sandler has also written a series of Yiddish children's stories based on Jewish folktales as well as the collection of rhyming couplets ניט געשטויגן, ניט געפֿלויגן (roughly: "It Didn't Happen that Way.") 

==Awards==

Boris Sandler has received nearly every Yiddish literary prize that was still being awarded in the 1990s and 2000s including the Jacob Fichman Prize (2002), the Dovid Hofshtein Prize awarded by the Yiddish Writer’s Union in Israel (2005) and the J. I. Segal Prize from the Jewish Public Library of Montreal for the best new work of Yiddish literature (2010 and 2014).

Additionally Sandler's short film on the history of the Forward building received an Ippies award from the Center for Community and Ethnic Media at CUNY.

'''Alexandrine Élisabeth Brémond''' (28 October 1858 – 22 June 1898), known as '''Brémonde de Tarascon''', was a well known poet from the south of France who wrote in the [[Occitan language]]. She was a member of the [[Félibrige]], a society that tried to preserve the language and its literature.

==Life==

Alexandrine Élisabeth Brémond was born in [[Tarascon]], Bouches-du-Rhône, on 28 October 1858.
Her parents were Alexandre Brémond and Henriette Reynier.
They owned and cultivated a farm in Trébon, near Arles, and soon after her birth acquired the Darbousille farm at [[Fontvieille, Bouches-du-Rhône]], also near Arles.
She grew up in modest circumstances.
Alexandrine began writing poetry in Provencal under the pseudonym "Brémonde de Tarascon", or "Bremoundo de Tarascouno" in Provençal, and would become one of the best known Provençal poets of her day.{{sfn|Brémonde de Tarascon ... GénéProvence}}

In 1885 Brémonde de Tarascon was awarded the prize for poetry at the Grand Jo Flourau dou Felibrige (Great Floral Games of the Félibrige).{{sfn|Armana Prouvencau 1886 |p=11}}
The Grands Jeux Floraux have been held every seven years since 1878 by the Félibrige to reward the best writers in the Occitan language.
The grand prize winner has the honor of choosing the Queen of the Félibrige, an honorary title that will be held for the next seven years.
Brémonde de Tarascon chose Thérèse Roumanille, wife of Jules Boissière.{{sfn|Grands jeux floraux et reines du Félibrige}}{{efn|Jules Boissière was secretary of the Félibrige de Paris for many years before moving to [[French Indochina]].{{sfn|Le Félibrige – La Plume}} }}

[[File:Brémonde de Tarascon 1.jpg|thumb|Bust of Brémond inaugurated on 2 May 1965 by the town of Tarascon and the [[Acadèmia dels Jòcs Florals]] ]]
On 25 November 1886 Alexandrine married the lawyer Joseph Gautier, who also wrote poetry.{{sfn|Armana Prouvencau 1886 |p=19}}
A few years later her parents divorced.
Alexandrine gave birth to a daughter, Marthe Gautier, in 1894. 
Marthe later became a police medical inspector in Paris.
Alexandrine died of [[acute bronchitis]] on 22 June 1898 at the Darboussille farmhouse, aged 40.
Her eulogy was pronounced by the poet [[Charloun Rieu]].{{sfn|Brémonde de Tarascon ... GénéProvence}}
The town of Tarascon has given her name to one of its squares and erected a bust of the poetess.{{sfn|Place Alexandrine Brémond – My Provence}}
The bust, by sculptor Camille Soccorsi, was inaugurated on 2 May 1965.{{sfn|monument à la Brémonde de Tarascon – Patrimages}}

==Work==

[[Frédéric Mistral (great-nephew)|Frédéric Mistral (neveu)]] said Alexandrine Élisabeth Brémond was the most lyrical of the Provencal poets, and saw her as the literary sister of [[Théodore Aubanel]].
Her first work to appear in print was ''Li Blavet de Mount-Majour'' (The Blueberries of Montmajour, 1883).
The poems celebrate flowers, pretty girls at the window, spring, laughter, the breeze in the trees and a serene song of young love, joy and hope.{{sfn|Mistral|1924|p=122}}
In ''Velo blanco'' (''White Veil''), which appeared in 1887, a girl who is bold and timid, who laughs and cries, sings her hopes; a woman speaks her love.{{sfn|Mistral|1924|p=123}}
The superb ''L'Amazone'' was included in the second volume of the ''Anthologie du Félibrige Provençal'', edited by Charles Pierre Julian and Pierre Fontan.{{sfn|Mistral|1924|p=124}}

Alexandrine's next work, published five years later, was ''Brut de canèu'' (''Sound of reeds'').
[[Frédéric Mistral]] wrote the preface.
The collection is a second return to her childhood, the great plains of the Trébon of Arles where she saw her father's laborers tracing their furrows as far as the eye could see towards Montmajour, whose towers exalt the glory of God, towards the banks of the Vigueirat Marshes where she saw the fish spawn and the water lilies bloom, and towards the farmhouse at Darbousille where she gazed at the stars in the long summer evenings.{{sfn|Mistral|1924|p=125}}
Three poems are exceptional: ''Le maître d’aire''; ''Aubanel'', in honour of the great lyric poet; and ''Pluie d’étoiles'' (''Rain of Stars''), describing a flock of stars that turn into women as they touch the ground, the muses, dreamers and singers of all the ages.{{sfn|Mistral|1924|p=126}}

''Lou debanaire flouri'' (The Flowery Reel) with a preface by [[Paul Arène]], was not published until 1908, ten years after her death. 
It was a collection of poems that had appeared in various publications during her life.
One, in verses that leap like bulls, tells the legend of the Bulls of Peter. It is perhaps the best known.{{sfn|Mistral|1924|p=126}}

'''Check-in''' is the process whereby people announce their arrival at a [[hotel]], [[airport]], [[port|seaport]], or event.

==Airport check-in==
[[Image:Check-in counter at Mumbai International Airport T1 for domestic flights.jpg|thumb|right|Check-in at [[Mumbai International Airport]] (domestic terminal)]]
{{Main|Airport check-in}}
The check-in process at [[airport]]s enables passengers to check in luggage onto a plane and to obtain a [[boarding pass]]. When presenting at the check-in counter, a passenger will provide evidence of the right to travel, such as a ticket, visa or electronic means. Each [[airline]] provides facilities for passengers to check in their luggage, except for their carry-on bags. This may be by way of airline-employed staff at check-in counters at airports or through an agency arrangement or by way of a self-service kiosk. The luggage is weighed and tagged, and then placed on a conveyor that usually feeds the luggage into the main [[baggage handling system]]. The luggage goes into the aircraft's [[cargo]] hold. The check-in staff then issues each passenger with a boarding pass.

There is an increasing trend towards more streamlined checking-in processes, whereby passengers can bypass or reduce the time in queues at the staffed check-in counters. This may involve passengers checking in online before arriving at the airport or using an [[Common-use self-service|airline's self-service check-in kiosk]]s at the airport. Some airports have a curbside check-in, where passengers can check in their bags to an airline representative before entering the terminal and then proceeding directly to security.

Many airlines have a deadline for passengers to check-in before each flight. This is to allow the airline to offer unclaimed seats to stand-by passengers, to load luggage onto the plane and to finalize documentation for take-off. The passenger must also take into account the time that would be required for them to clear the check-in line, to pass security and then to walk (sometimes also to ride) from the check-in area to the boarding area. This may take several hours at some airports or at some times of the year. On international flights, additional time would be required for immigration and customs clearance.

==Hotels==
[[Image:Front desk-hotel.JPG|right|thumb|[[Kempinski]] Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten check-in]]
At [[hotels]] or similar establishments, guests are usually required to check in (also called register or sign-in), which involves providing or confirming the guests' personal information and providing a signature. The laws of some countries require guests to sign a register (or a registration card)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.visitbritain.org/pink-book/registration-and-data-protection Registration and data protection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California Code, [http://www.codepublishing.com/CA/Greenfield/html/Greenfield05/Greenfield0526.html Chapter 5.26, HOTEL RATES AND REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ontario, Canada: [https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90h17 Hotel Registration of Guests Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.17]&lt;/ref&gt; and some also require the provision of identification documents, such as a passport or drivers licence which the hotel can copy and retain for its records. Usually, only one guest per room is required to register. Sometimes, the register may need to be provided to a government agency, such as members of the police, sometimes with a court warrant or similar authority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/06/22/supreme-court-hotel-registries/27723049/ Justices limit police searches of hotel registries]&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment may require guests to provide a [[credit card]] guarantee to cover potential costs such as [[room service]] or mini-bar for the duration of the stay and to enable an express check-out at the end of the stay. At the end of the check-in, the reception staff will provide guests with a room [[key (lock)|key]].

Check-in times vary but this can range from 12 pm until about 3 pm depending on the establishment's rules and regulations. Late check-ins can be arranged through the hotel as long as the guests book this in advance and arrange all the necessary details. Hotels usually specify a check-in time after which they expect guests to check-in. If a guest wants to occupy a hotel room before the hotel's check-in time, some hotels charge for an additional day or treat it as a previous day's stay (as compared to occupying the hotel room after the check-in time). Most hotels, however, allow a grace time (typically 30–60 minutes) on request by a guest, without any additional charge, if a guest wishes to take the room before the check-in time. Some hotels also have a latest check-in time, often 6 pm-8 pm, after which they may give a room to someone else if the room is not prepaid or the guest does not phone in to indicate a time of arrival. Some hotels have a deadline for checking-in because the reception may close for the night. For the most cost-effective usage of hotel room occupancy, a guest should try to arrive at about hotel's check-in time and leave or hand over the hotel room at about the hotel's check-out time, but it may not be always practical because the guest's arrival and departure time of flights or car trips may not align with the hotel check-in and check-out time and for other reasons.

==Social network==
Many social networking services, such as [[Foursquare]], [[Google Latitude]] (closed), [[Google+]], [[Facebook]], [[Jiepang]], [[VK (social network)|VK]], [[Gowalla]] (closed), [[GetGlue]] and [[Brightkite]] (closed), allow users to what has been referred to as [[Location-based service#Self-reported positioning|self-reported positioning]],&lt;ref name="Flintham2003-URAY"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Broll | first1 = W. | last2 = Ohlenburg | first2 = J. | last3 = Lindt | first3 = I. | last4 = Herbst | first4 = I. | last5 = Braun | first5 = A.

Users can check into a specific location by text messaging or by using a mobile application on a [[smartphone]]—the application will use the phone's [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] to find the current location.

Many applications have a “Places” button or tab where a user can see a list of nearby places into which the user can check in. If a location is not on the nearby places list, the user can add the location directly from the phone. Once users have checked in, they have the option of sharing their location with friends in services such as [[Twitter]] or Facebook.

Since the check-in became a ubiquitous mechanism in most mobile applications, the industry especially in the gaming branch, has tried to find alternatives. Gaming applications ,in particular, require the user to check in multiple times in a row, so the mechanism becomes a sustained routine. Currently, possibilities for an auto-check-in are tested by developers.

'''Chroma key compositing''', or '''chroma keying''', is a [[visual effects]]/[[post-production]] technique for [[compositing]] (layering) two [[image]]s or [[video]] streams together based on color hues ([[colorfulness|chroma]] range). The technique has been used heavily in many fields to remove a [[wikt:background|background]] from the subject of a photo or video&amp;nbsp;– particularly the [[news]]casting, [[motion picture]] and [[videogame]] industries. A color range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene. The chroma keying technique is commonly used in [[video production]] and post-production. This technique is also referred to as '''color keying''', '''colour-separation overlay''' ('''CSO'''; primarily by the [[BBC]]&lt;ref name="What is Chroma Key?"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lumeo.com.au/chroma-key/ |title=What is Chroma Key?|publisher=Lumeo |access-date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or by various terms for specific color-related variants such as '''green screen''', and '''blue screen'''&amp;nbsp;– chroma keying can be done with backgrounds of any color that are uniform and distinct, but green and blue backgrounds are more commonly used because they differ most distinctly in hue from most [[human skin color]]s. No part of the subject being filmed or photographed may duplicate the color used as the backing.&lt;ref name="BorisFX"/&gt;

It is commonly used for [[weather forecasting|weather forecast]] [[broadcast]]s, wherein a [[news presenter]] is usually seen standing in front of a large [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] map during live television [[newscast]]s, though in actuality it is a large blue or green background. When using a blue screen, different weather maps are added on the parts of the image where the color is blue. If the news presenter wears blue clothes, his or her clothes will also be replaced with the background video. Chroma keying is also common in the entertainment industry for visual effects in [[movies]] and video games.

==History==

===Predecessors===

Prior to the introduction of [[Matte (filmmaking)|travelling mattes]] and [[optical printer|optical printing]], [[double exposure]] was used to introduce elements into a scene which were not present in the initial exposure. This was done using black draping where a green screen would be used today. [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] first used this approach in 1898. In 1903, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' by [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]] used double exposure to add background scenes to windows which were black when filmed on set, using a [[garbage matte]] to expose only the window areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Experimental Filmmaking: Break the Machine | author=Kathryn Ramey | page=70 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYRICgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to have figures in one exposure actually move in front of a substituted background in the other, a travelling matte was needed, to occlude the correct portion of the background in each frame. In 1918 [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank Williams]] patented a travelling matte technique, again based on using a black background. This was used in many films, such as ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''.&lt;ref name=Foster /&gt;{{rp|4}}

In the 1920s, [[Walt Disney]] used a white backdrop to include human actors with cartoon characters and backgrounds in his ''[[Alice Comedies]]''.&lt;ref name=Foster /&gt;{{rp|5}}

===Bluescreen===
The blue screen method was developed in the 1930s at [[RKO Radio Pictures]].  At RKO, [[Linwood Dunn]] used an early version of the [[Matte (filmmaking)|travelling matte]] to create "wipes" – where there were transitions like a windshield wiper in films such as ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933). Credited to [[Lawrence W. Butler|Larry Butler]], a scene featuring a genie escaping from a bottle was the first use of a proper bluescreen process to create a traveling matte for ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940), which won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Academy Award for Best Special Effects]] that year. In 1950, [[Warner Brothers]] employee and ex-[[Kodak]] researcher [[Arthur Widmer]] began working on an [[ultraviolet]] travelling matte process. He also began developing bluescreen techniques: one of the first films to use them was the [[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|1958 adaptation]] of the [[Ernest Hemingway]] novella, ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', starring [[Spencer Tracy]].&lt;ref name="cri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2246/2005-2-14/90@206385.htm|title=Illusions Take Home First Oscars|date=14 February 2005|publisher=[[China Radio International|CRI English]]|accessdate=21 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315004609/http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2246/2005-2-14/90%40206385.htm|archivedate=15 March 2005|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petro Vlahos]] was awarded an Academy Award for his refinement of these techniques in 1964. His technique exploits the fact that most objects in real-world scenes have a color whose blue-color component is similar in intensity to their green-color component. [[Zbigniew Rybczyński]] also contributed to bluescreen technology. An [[optical printer]] with two projectors, a film camera and a 'beam splitter', was used to combine the actor in front of a blue screen together with the background footage, one frame at a time. In the early 1970s, American and British television networks began using green backdrops instead of blue for their newscasts. During the 1980s, [[minicomputer]]s were used to control the optical printer. For the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', [[Richard Edlund]] created a 'quad optical printer' that accelerated the process considerably and saved money. He received a special [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his innovation.

For decades, travelling matte shots had to be done "locked-down", so that neither the matted subject nor the background could shift their camera perspective at all.  Later, computer-timed, [[Motion control photography|motion-control]] cameras alleviated this problem, as both the foreground and background could be filmed with the same camera moves.

Meteorologists on television often use a field monitor, to the side of the screen, to see where they are putting their hands against the background images. A newer technique is to project a faint image onto the screen.

Some films make heavy use of chroma key to add backgrounds that are constructed entirely using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). Performances from different takes can be composited together, which allows actors to be filmed separately and then placed together in the same scene. Chroma key allows performers to appear to be in any location without leaving the studio. 
Computer development also made it easier to [[camera tracking|incorporate motion]] into composited shots, even when using handheld cameras. Reference-points can be placed onto the colored background (usually as a painted grid, X's marked with tape, or equally spaced tennis balls attached to the wall).  In post-production, a computer can use the references to compute the camera's position and thus render an image that matches the perspective and movement of the foreground perfectly.  Modern advances in software and computational power have eliminated the need to accurately place the markers – the software figures out their position in space (a disadvantage of this is that it requires a large camera movement, possibly encouraging modern film techniques where the camera is always in motion).

==Process==
[[File:SpiderwickChroniclesSet.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Film set for ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles (film)|The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'', where a visual effects scene using bluescreen chroma key is in preparation]]

The principal subject is filmed or photographed against a background consisting of a single colour or a relatively narrow range of colours, usually blue or green because these colours are considered to be the farthest away from skin tone.&lt;ref name="BorisFX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borisfx.com/tutorials/chroma_key.php|title=The Chroma Effect|work=Chroma Key Tutorial|publisher=BorisFX|quote=If the foreground is a person then blue or green backing colour is recommended as these colours are not present in human flesh pigments.

This process is commonly known as "[[keying (graphics)|keying]]", "keying out" or simply a "key".

===Processing a green backdrop===
[[File:VirtuellesStudio Greenbox.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Virtual television studio with green-screen technique. The high amount of contrast between different parts of the screen is not ideal (see [[Chroma key#Even lighting|even lighting]]). Green reflections from the desk would create undesirable artifacts.]]

Green is used as a backdrop for TV and electronic cinematography more than any other colour because television weathermen tended to wear blue suits. When chroma keying first came into use in television production, the blue screen that was then the norm in the movie industry was used out of habit, until other practical considerations caused the television industry to move from blue to green screens. Broadcast quality color television cameras use separate red, green and blue image sensors, and early analog TV chroma keyers required RGB component video to work reliably. From a technological perspective it was equally possible to use the blue or green channel, but because blue clothing was an ongoing challenge, the green screen came into common use. Newscasters sometimes forget the chroma key dress code, and when the key is applied to clothing of the same color as the background, the person would seem to disappear into the key. Because green clothing is less common than blue, it soon became apparent that it was easier to use a green matte screen than it was to constantly police the clothing choices of on-air talent.   Also, because the human eye is more sensitive to green wavelengths, which lie in the middle of the visible light spectrum, the green analog video channel typically carried more signal strength, giving a better signal to noise ratio compared to the other component video channels, so green screen keys could produce the cleanest key. In the digital television and cinema age, much of the tweaking that was required to make a good quality key has been automated. However, the one constant that remains is some level of color coordination to keep foreground subjects from being keyed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.videomaker.com/article/f5/13055-the-keys-to-chromakey-how-to-use-a-green-screen |title=The Keys To Chromakey: How To Use A Green Screen|publisher=Videomaker |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Processing a blue backdrop===
Before electronic chroma keying, compositing was done on (chemical) film. The camera colour negative was printed onto high-contrast black and white film, using either a filter or the colour sensitivity of the black and white film to limit it to the blue channel. Assuming this film was a negative it produced clear where the blue matte screen was, black elsewhere, except it also produced clear for any white objects (since they also contained blue). Removing these spots could be done by a suitable double-exposure with the colour positive, and many other techniques. The end result was a clear background with an opaque shape of the subject in the middle. This is called a ''female matte'', similar to an ''[[alpha matte]]'' in digital keying. Copying this film onto another high-contrast negative produced the opposite 'male matte'. The background negative was then packed with the female matte and exposed onto a final strip of film, then the camera negative was packed with the male matte was double-printed onto this same film. These two images combined together creates the final effect.

===Major factors===
The most important factor for a key is the colour separation of the foreground (the subject) and background (the screen)&amp;nbsp;– a blue screen will be used if the subject is predominately green (for example plants), despite the camera being more sensitive to green light.

In [[Analog television|analog colour TV]], colour is represented by the phase of the chroma [[Subcarrier#Television|subcarrier]] relative to a reference oscillator. Chroma key is achieved by comparing the phase of the video to the phase corresponding to the pre-selected color. In-phase portions of the video are replaced by the alternate background video.

In [[Digital television|digital colour TV]], colour is represented by three numbers (red, green, blue intensity levels). Chroma key is achieved by a simple numerical comparison between the video and the pre-selected color. If the color at a particular point on the screen matches (either exactly, or in a range), then the video at that point is replaced by the alternate background.

====Lighting====
In order to create an illusion that characters and objects filmed are present in the intended background scene, the lighting in the two scenes must be a reasonable match. For outdoor scenes, overcast days create a diffuse, evenly colored light which can be easier to match in the studio, whereas direct sunlight needs to be matched in both direction and overall color based on time of day.

A studio shot taken in front of a green screen will naturally have ambient light the same color as the screen, due to its light scattering. This effect is known as ''spill''.&lt;ref name=Foster /&gt;{{rp|p20}} This can look unnatural or cause portions of the characters to disappear, so must be compensated for, or avoided by using a larger screen placed far from the actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Aronson |first1= David |authorlink1= David Aronson |title= DV Filmmaking: From Start to Finish, Volume 1 |year= 2006 |publisher= O'Reilly Media, Inc. |isbn= 0596008481 |pages= 52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Camera====
The depth of field used to record the scene in front of the coloured screen should match that of the background. This can mean recording the actors with a larger depth of field than normal.&lt;ref name="bermingham"&gt;{{Cite book | first= Alan | last=Bermingham | title= Location Lighting for Television | year= 2013 | publisher=Focal Press | isbn=0-240-51937-X | page= 42 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bAcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clothing==
{{multiple image
| footer = Girl wearing blue clothing in front of green screen. The shadows cast onto the green screen are not ideal (see [[Chroma key#Even lighting|even lighting]].)
| image1 = Girl in front of a green background.jpg
| width1 = {{#expr: (260 * 640 / 960) round 0}}
| image2 = Girl in room, green screen example.jpg
| width2 = {{#expr: (260 * 707 / 892) round 0}}
}}
A chroma key subject must avoid wearing clothes which are similar in color to the chroma key color(s) (unless intentional e.g., wearing a green top to make it appear that the subject has no body), because the clothing may be replaced with the background image/video. An example of intentional use of this is when an actor wears a blue covering over a part of his body to make it invisible in the final shot. This technique can be used to achieve an effect similar to that used in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films to create the effect of an [[Cloak of invisibility|invisibility cloak]]. The actor can also be filmed against a chroma-key background and inserted into the background shot with a distortion effect, in order to create a cloak that is marginally detectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.creativecow.net/articles/stern_eran/Invisible_Cape.php |title=Creating an invisible cape in After Effects |publisher=Library.creativecow.net |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficulties emerge with blue screen when a costume in an effects shot must be blue, such as [[Superman]]'s traditional blue outfit.  In the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', in scenes where both [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Green Goblin]] are in the air, Spider-Man had to be shot in front of the green screen and the Green Goblin had to be shot in front of a blue screen. The color difference is because Spider-Man wears a costume which is red and blue in color and the Green Goblin wears a costume which is entirely green in color. If both were shot in front of the same screen, parts of one character would be erased from the shot.

For a clean division of foreground from background, it is also important that clothing and hair in the foreground shot have a fairly simple silhouette, as fine details such as frizzy hair may not resolve properly. Similarly, partially transparent elements of the costume cause problems.&lt;ref name="bermingham" /&gt;

==Background color==
[[File:MuseumOfScienceBoston BlueScreenAtSpecialEffectsShow.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Demonstration of the creation of visual effects techniques utilizing chroma key]]

[[Blue]] was originally used for TV chroma keying [[special effects]] because{{citation needed |date=May 2016}} [[human]] [[skin]] tone contains very little blue, and because the film industry used blue backgrounds for similar purposes. The color blue was tied to the blue emulsion layer of film having comparable grain and detail in comparison to the red and [[green]] layers of the emulsion. In television and digital filmmaking, however, green has become the favored color because of some practical considerations, and because lossy compression algorithms used in both analog and digital TV distribution retain more detail in the green channel. The choice of color is up to the effects artists and the needs of the specific shot. Whereas the blue screen was introduced to the television industry by the film industry, the use of green screen visual effects has been introduced to the film industry as electronic imaging has augmented and replaced the use of chemical film stock in cinema. Also, the green background is favored over blue for outdoor filming where the blue sky might appear in the frame and could accidentally be replaced in the process. Although green and blue are the most common in part because red, green and blue components are used to encode the visible light spectrum, any key color can be used. Red is avoided for human subjects due to its prevalence in white skin tones, but can be often used for objects and scenes which do not involve people.

So-called "[[Sodium vapor process|yellow screen]]" is accomplished with a white backdrop. Ordinary stage lighting is used in combination with a bright yellow sodium lamp. The sodium light falls almost entirely in a narrow frequency band, which can then be separated from the other light using a prism, and projected onto a separate but synchronized film carrier within the camera. This second film is high-contrast black and white, and is processed to produce the matte.&lt;ref name=Foster&gt;{{cite book | title=The Green Screen Handbook: Real-World Production Techniques | first=Jeff | last=Foster | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-470-52107-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

Occasionally, a [[magenta]] background is used, as in some software applications where the magenta or [[fuchsia (color)|fuchsia]] is sometimes referred to as "magic pink".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.skinyourscreen.com/site/Articles/so-you-wanna-make-a-theme | title = So you wanna make a theme? | work = skinyourscreen.com articles | accessdate = 23 August 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071029042547/http://www.skinyourscreen.com/site/Articles/so-you-wanna-make-a-theme | archivedate = 29 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer technique is to use a [[retroreflective]] curtain in the background, along with a ring of bright [[LED]]s around the [[camera lens]].  This requires no light to shine on the background other than the LEDs, which use an extremely small amount of power and space unlike big [[stage light]]s, and require no [[rigging (theatre)|rigging]].  This advance was made possible by the invention in the 1990s of practical blue LEDs, which also allow for [[Emerald (color)|emerald green]] LEDs.

There is also a form of color keying that uses light spectrum invisible to human eye. Called Thermo-Key, it uses [[infrared]] as the key color, which would not be replaced by background image during [[Video post-processing|postprocessing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/project/thermo-key/|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221094257/http://www.hc.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/project/thermo-key|archive-date=21 February 2009|title=What is Thermo-Key?|publisher=[[University of Tokyo]]|accessdate=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1255805|title=Thermo-key: human region segmentation from video|journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|year=2004|volume=24|issue=1|pages=26–30|pmid=15384664|doi=10.1109/MCG.2004.1255805 |last1=Yasuda|first1=K. |last2=Naemura|first2=T. |last3=Harashima|first3=H. |accessdate=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', an [[ultraviolet light]] matting process was proposed by Don Lee of CIS Hollywood and developed by [[Gary Hutzel]] and the staff of [[Image G]].  This involved a [[fluorescent]] orange backdrop which made it easier to generate a holdout [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]], thus allowing the effects team to produce effects in a quarter of the time needed for other methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Sternbach |first1= Rick |authorlink1= Rick Sternbach |last2= Okuda |first2= Michael |authorlink2= Michael Okuda |title= [[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]] |year= 1991 |publisher= [[Pocket Books]] |isbn= 0-671-70427-3 |page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, any type of still background can be used as a chroma key instead of a solid color. First the background is captured without actors or other foreground elements; then the scene is recorded. The image of the background is used to cancel the background in the actual footage; for example in a digital image, each pixel will have a different chroma key. This is sometimes referred to as a ''difference matte''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Wright|title=Digital Compositing for Film and Video: Production Workflows and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-xHDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA2-PA23&amp;lpg=SA2-PA23&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=%22difference+matte%22&amp;dq=Steve+Wright.+Digital+Compositing+for+Film+and+Video#v=onepage&amp;q=%22difference%20matte%22&amp;f=false|date=22 November 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-315-28399-9|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this makes it easy for objects to be accidentally removed if they happen to be similar to the background, or for the background to remain due to camera noise or if it happens to change slightly from the reference footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Wright|title=Digital Compositing for Film and Video: Production Workflows and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-xHDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA2-PA25&amp;lpg=SA2-PA25&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=%22difference+matte%22&amp;dq=Steve+Wright.+Digital+Compositing+for+Film+and+Video#v=onepage&amp;q=%22difference%20matte%22&amp;f=false|date=22 November 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-315-28399-9|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A background with a repeating pattern alleviates many of these issues, and can be less sensitive to wardrobe color than solid-color backdrops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Every color chromakey | first1= Atsushi | last1=Yamashita | first2=Hiroki | last2=Agata | first3=Toru | last3=Kaneko | url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4761643&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F4740202%2F4760915%2F04761643.pdf%3Farnumber%3D4761643 | doi = 10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761643 | journal=ICPR 2008 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tolerances==

===Even lighting===
[[File:Myx tv.jpg|thumb|right|267px|A live broadcast of [[Myx TV]] using green-screen chroma key. Note the lack of shadows on the screen. The whiter area near the center of the image is due to the angle this photo was taken from, and would not appear from the video camera's angle.]]

The biggest challenge when setting up a bluescreen or greenscreen is even lighting and the avoidance of [[shadow]], because it is best to have as narrow a color range as possible being replaced. A shadow would present itself as a darker color to the camera and might not register for replacement. This can sometimes be seen in low-budget or live broadcasts where the errors cannot be manually repaired. The material being used affects the quality and ease of having it evenly lit. Materials which are shiny will be far less successful than those that are not. A shiny surface will have areas that reflect the lights making them appear pale, while other areas may be darkened. A matte surface will diffuse the reflected light and have a more even color range. In order to get the cleanest key from shooting greenscreen it is necessary to create a value difference between the subject and the greenscreen. In order to differentiate the subject from the screen, a two-stop difference can be used, either by making the greenscreen two stops higher than the subject, or vice versa.

Sometimes a shadow can be used to create a visual effect.  Areas of the bluescreen or greenscreen with a shadow on them can be replaced with a darker version of the desired background video image, making it look like the person is casting a shadow on them. Any spill of the chroma key color will make the result look unnatural. A difference in the [[focal length]] of the lenses used can affect the success of chroma key.

===Exposure===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}Another challenge for bluescreen or greenscreen is proper [[camera exposure]]. Underexposing or overexposing a colored backdrop can lead to poor [[Colorfulness|saturation]] levels. In the case of video cameras, underexposed images can contain high amounts of [[image noise|noise]], as well. The background must be bright enough to allow the camera to create a bright and saturated image.

==Programming==
There are several different quality- and speed-optimized techniques for implementing color keying in software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cs.utah.edu/~michael/chroma/ | title = High Quality Chroma Key | last=Ashihkmin |first=Michael|publisher = University of Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gcfilms"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gc-films.com/chromakey.html | title=Greenscreen code and hints | first=Edward | last=Cannon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most versions, a function ''f''(''r'', ''g'', ''b'') → ''α'' is applied to every pixel in the image. α&amp;nbsp;(alpha) has a meaning similar to that in [[alpha compositing]] techniques. ''α''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0 means the pixel is fully in the green screen, ''α''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 means the pixel is fully in the foreground object, and intermediate values indicate the pixel is partially covered by the foreground object (or it is transparent). A further function ''g''(''r'',&amp;nbsp;''g'',&amp;nbsp;''b'')&amp;nbsp;→ (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''g'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') is needed to remove green spill on the foreground objects.

A very simple ''f''() function for green screen is ''A''(''r''+''b'') − ''Bg'' where ''A'' and ''B'' are user adjustable constants with a default value of 1.0. A very simple ''g''() is (''r'', min(''g'',''b''), ''b''). This is fairly close to the capabilities of analog and film-based screen pulling.

Modern examples&lt;ref name="gcfilms" /&gt; of these functions are best described by two closed nested surfaces in the 3-D rgb space, often quite complex. Colors inside the inner surface are considered green screen. Colors outside the outer surface are opaque foreground. Colors between the surfaces are partially covered, they are more opaque the closer they are to the outer surface. Sometimes more closed surfaces are used to determine how to remove green spill. It is also very common for ''f''() to depend on more than just the current pixel's color, it may also use the (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') position, the values of nearby pixels, the value from reference images or a statistical color model of the scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2907940 | title=Interactive High-Quality Green-Screen Keying via Color Unmixing | first1=Yagiz | last1=Aksoy | first2=Tunc| last2=Aydin | first3=Marc| last3=Pollefeys | first4=Aljoscha | last4=Smolic | journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and values from user-drawn masks. These produce closed surfaces in a space with more than three dimensions.

A different class of algorithm tries to figure out a 2D path that separates the foreground from the background. This path can be the output, or the image can be drawn by filling the path with ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 as a final step. An example of such an algorithm is the use of [[active contour]]. Most research in recent years{{When|date=June 2016}} has been into these algorithms.

generate easily distinguishable appearance for computer data.

Although the [[desktop metaphor]] revolutionized user interfaces, there is evidence
that a spatial layout alone does little to help in locating files and other data;
distinguishable appearance is also required.
Studies have shown that average users have considerable difficulty finding files
on their personal computers, even ones that they created the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Search engines do not always help, since it has been found that users
often know of the existence of a file without being able to specify relevant search terms.
On the contrary, people appear to incrementally search for files using some form of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Recently researchers and web developers have argued that the problem is the
lack of distinguishable appearance:  in the traditional computer interface most objects
and locations appear identical.  This problem rarely occurs in the real world, where
both objects and locations generally have easily distinguishable appearance.
Discriminability was one of the recommendations in the 
ISO 9241-12 recommendation on presentation of information on visual displays
(part of the overall report on [[ISO_9241|Ergonomics of Human System Interaction]]),
however it was assumed in that report that this would be achieved by manual 
design of graphical symbols.

==VisualIDs, semanticons, and identicons==
The mass availability of computer graphics supported the introduction of approaches
that make better use of the brain's "visual hardware", by providing
individual files and other abstract data with distinguishable appearance.
This idea initially appeared in strictly academic 
VisualIDs&lt;ref name="visualids"&gt;

developed by Setlur et al. demonstrated an algorithm to create icons that reflect the content of files.
In this work the name, location and content of a file are parsed and used to retrieve
related image(s) from an image database.  These are then processed using a [[Non-photorealistic rendering]] technique in order to generate graphical icons.

Developer Don Park introduced the [[identicon]] library for making a visual icon from a hash
of a data identifier.  This initial public implementation has spawned a large number
of implementations for various environments.  In particular, identicons are
now being used as default visual user identifiers (avatars) for several widely used systems.  They are also used as a complement to [[Gravatar]]s, which are pre-existing avatar images created or chosen by users, instead of automatically generated images.
(see [[#External links]]).

==Current research==
While current web practice has followed the semantics-free approach of VisualIDs,
recent research has followed the semantics-based approach of Semanticons.
Examples include using data mining principles to automatically create "intelligent icons"
that reflect the contents of files&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4994">The '''Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture''' is an important conjecture in [[metric number theory]] proposed by [[Richard Duffin|R. J.

: &lt;math&gt; \left | \alpha - \frac{p}{q} \right | &lt; \frac{f(q)}{q} &lt;/math&gt;

has infinitely many solutions in [[co-prime]] integers &lt;math&gt;p,q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;q &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the sum

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{q=1}^\infty f(q) \frac{\varphi(q)}{q} = \infty. &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt; \varphi(q)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euler totient function]].

The full conjecture remains unsolved. However, a higher-dimensional analogue of this conjecture has been resolved.&lt;ref name=Mon204/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=A.D. | last1=Pollington | first2=R.C. | last2=Vaughan | author2-link=Bob Vaughan | title=The ''k'' dimensional Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture | journal=Mathematika | volume=37 | number=2 | year=1990 | pages=190–200 | zbl=0715.11036 | issn=0025-5793 | doi=10.1112/s0025579300012900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Har0269&gt;Harman (2002) p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progress==
The implication from the existence of the rational approximations to the divergence of the series follows from the [[Borel–Cantelli lemma]].&lt;ref name=Har0268&gt;Harman (2002) p.68&lt;/ref&gt;  The converse implication is the crux of the conjecture.&lt;ref name=Mon204/&gt;
There have been many partial results of the Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture established to date. [[Paul Erdős]] established in 1970 that the conjecture holds if there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; such that for every integer &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; we have either &lt;math&gt;f(n) = c/n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f(n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Mon204&gt;{{ cite book | last=Montgomery | first=Hugh L. | author-link=Hugh Montgomery (mathematician) | title=Ten lectures on the interface between analytic number theory and harmonic analysis | series=Regional Conference Series in Mathematics | volume=84 | location=Providence, RI | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=1994 | isbn=978-0-8218-0737-8 | zbl=0814.11001 | page=204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Har27&gt;Harman (1998) p.27&lt;/ref&gt; This was strengthened by Jeffrey Vaaler in 1978 to the case &lt;math&gt;f(n) = O(n^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.osu.edu/files/duffin-schaeffer%20conjecture.pdf | title=Department of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Har28&gt;Harman (1998) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, this was strengthened to the conjecture being true whenever there exists some &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; such that the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{f(n)}{n}\right)^{1 + \epsilon} \varphi(n) = \infty &lt;/math&gt;.

Velani, ''The Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture with extra divergence'', arXiv, (2009), https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1234&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Beresnevich and Velani proved that a [[Hausdorff measure]] analogue of the Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture is equivalent to the original Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture, which is a priori weaker. This result is published in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Beresnevich | first1=Victor | last2=Velani | first2=Sanju | title=A mass transference principle and the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture for Hausdorff measures | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | volume=164 | number=3 | year=2006 | pages=971–992 | zbl=1148.11033 | issn=0003-486X | doi=10.4007/annals.2006.164.971| arxiv=math/0412141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9166">'''Error diffusion''' is a type of [[halftone|halftoning]] in which the [[quantization (image processing)|quantization]] residual is distributed to neighboring [[pixel]]s that have not yet been processed. Its main use is to convert a multi-level image into a [[binary file|binary]] image, though it has other applications.

Unlike many other halftoning methods, error diffusion is classified as an area operation, because what the algorithm does at one location influences what happens at other locations. This means [[Data buffer|buffering]] is required, and complicates [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]]. Point operations, such as ordered [[dither]], do not have these complications.

Error diffusion has the tendency to enhance edges in an image. This can make text in images more readable than in other [[halftone|halftoning]] techniques.

==Early history==
[[Richard Howland Ranger]] received United States [[patent]] 1790723 for his [[invention]], "Facsimile system." The patent, which issued in 1931, describes a system for transmitting [[image]]s over telephone or telegraph lines, or by radio.&lt;ref name="Ranger1931"&gt;Richard Howland Ranger, '''Facsimile system.''' United States Patent 1790723, issued 3 February 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Ranger's invention permitted [[continuous tone]] [[photograph]]s to be converted first into black and white, then transmitted to remote locations, which had a pen moving over a piece of paper. To render black, the pen was lowered to the paper; to produce white, the pen was raised. Shades of [[gray]] were rendered by intermittently raising and lowering the pen, depending upon the [[luminance]] of the gray desired.

Ranger's invention used capacitors to store charges, and [[vacuum tube]] comparators to determine when the present luminance, plus any accumulated error, was above a threshold (causing the pen to be raised) or below (causing the pen to be lowered). In this sense, it was an [[Analog electronics|analog]] version of error diffusion.

==Enter the digital era==
[[Floyd–Steinberg dithering|Floyd and Steinberg]] described a system for performing error diffusion on [[Digital data|digital]] images based on a simple kernel:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{16}\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}- &amp; \# &amp; 7 \\ 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where "&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;" denotes a pixel in the current row which has already been processed (hence diffusing error to it would be pointless), and "#" denotes the pixel currently being processed.

Nearly concurrently, J F Jarvis, C N Judice, and W H Ninke of [[Bell Labs]] disclosed a similar method which they termed "'''{{visible anchor|minimized average error}}'''" using a larger [[Convolution kernel|kernel]]: &lt;ref name="Jarvis1976"&gt;J F Jarvis, C N Judice, and W H Ninke, A survey of techniques for the display of continuous tone pictures on bilevel displays. ''Computer Graphics and Image Processing,'' '''5''':1:13–40 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{48}\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}- &amp; - &amp; \# &amp; 7 &amp; 5 \\ 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 7 &amp; 5 &amp; 3 \\ 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

==Algorithm description==

Error diffusion takes a monochrome or color image and reduces the number of quantization levels. A popular application of error diffusion involves reducing the number of quantization states to just two per channel. This makes the image suitable for printing on binary printers such as black and white laser printers.

In the discussion which follows, it is assumed that the number of quantization states in the error diffused image is two per channel, unless otherwise stated.

=== One-dimensional error diffusion ===
The simplest form of the algorithm scans the image one row at a time and one pixel at a time.
The current pixel is compared to a half-gray value. If it is above the value a white pixel is generated in the resulting image.
If the pixel is below the half way brightness, a black pixel is generated. Different methods may be used if the target palette is not monochrome, such as thresholding with two values if the target palette is black, gray and white.
The generated pixel is either full bright, or full black, so there is an error in the image.
The error is then added to the next pixel in the image and the process repeats.

=== Two-dimensional error diffusion ===
One dimensional error diffusion tends to have severe image artifacts that show up as distinct vertical lines.
Two dimensional error diffusion reduces the visual artifacts.
The simplest algorithm is exactly like one dimensional error diffusion, except half the error is added to the next pixel, and half of the error is added to the pixel on the next line below.

The kernel is:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\left[\begin{array}{cc}  \# &amp; 1  \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where "#" denotes the pixel currently being processed.

Further refinement can be had by dispersing the error further away from the current pixel, as in the matrix given above in ''Enter the digital era''.  The sample image at the start of this article is an example of two dimensional error diffusion.

=== Color error diffusion ===
The same algorithms may be applied to each of the red, green, and blue (or cyan, magenta, yellow, black) channels of a color image to achieve a color effect on printers such as color laser printers that can only print single color values.

However, better visual results may be obtained by first converting the color channels into a perceptive [[color model]] that will separate lightness, hue and saturation channels, so that a higher weight for error diffusion will be given to the lightness channel, than to the hue channel. The motivation for this conversion is that human vision better perceives small differences of lightness in small local areas, than similar differences of hue in the same area, and even more than similar differences of saturation on the same area.

For example, if there is a small error in the green channel that cannot be represented, and another small error in the red channel in the same case, the properly weighted sum of these two errors may be used to adjust a perceptible lightness error, that can be represented in a balanced way between all three color channels (according to their respective statistical contribution to the lightness), even if this produces a larger error for the hue when converting the green channel. This error will be diffused in the neighboring pixels.

In addition, [[gamma correction]] may be needed on each of these perceptive channels, if they don't scale linearly with the human vision, so that error diffusion can be accumulated linearly to these gamma-corrected linear channels, before computing the final color channels of the rounded pixel colors, using a reverse conversion to the native non gamma-corrected image format and from which the new residual error will be computed and converted again to be distributed to the next pixels.

It should also be noted that, due to limitations of precision during the numeric conversion between color models (notably if this conversion is not linear or uses non integer weights), additional roundoff errors may occur that should be taken into account into the residual error.

=== Error diffusion with several gray levels ===
Error Diffusion may also be used to produce output images with more than two levels (per channel, in the case of color images). This has application in displays and printers which can produce 4, 8, or 16 levels in each image plane, such as electrostatic printers and displays in compact mobile telephones. Rather than use a single threshold to produce binary output, the closest permitted level is determined, and the error, if any, is diffused as described above.

=== Printer considerations ===
Most printers overlap the black dots slightly so there is not an exact one-to-one relationship to dot frequency (in dots per unit area) and [[Lightness (color)|lightness]]. Tone scale linearization may be applied to the source image to get the printed image to look correct.

=== Edge enhancement versus lightness preservation ===
When an image has a transition from light to dark the error diffusion algorithm tends to 
make the next generated pixel be black. Dark to light transitions tend to result in the next
generated pixel being white. This causes an edge enhancement effect at the expense of gray level
reproduction accuracy. This results in error diffusion having a higher apparent resolution than other [[halftone]] methods. This is especially beneficial with images with text in them such as the typical facsimile.

This effect shows fairly well in the picture at the top of this article. The grass detail and the text on the sign is well preserved, 
and the lightness in the sky, containing little detail. A cluster-dot [[halftone]] image of the same resolution would be much less sharp.

'''Fula''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|uː|l|ə}}&lt;ref name=Bauer&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;, also known as '''Fulani''' {{IPAc-en|f|ʊ|ˈ|l|ɑː|n|iː}}&lt;ref name=Bauer /&gt; or '''Fulah'''&lt;ref name="Ethnologue 19"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/19/language/ful/ |title=Fulah |work=[[Ethnologue]] |edition=19 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO 639-2/RA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/langcodes_name.php?code_ID=151 |title=Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: ful |publisher=ISO 639-2 Registration Authority - Library of Congress |access-date=2017-07-04 |quote=Name: Fulah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO 639-3/RA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=ful |title=Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: ful |publisher=ISO 639-3 Registration Authority - SIL International |access-date=2017-07-04 |quote=Name: Fulah}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Fula: ''Fulfulde, Pulaar, Pular''; {{lang-fr|Peul}}), is a language spoken as a set of various dialects in a [[Dialect continuum|continuum]] that stretches across some 20 countries in [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]]. Along with other related languages such as [[Serer language|Serer]] and [[Wolof language|Wolof]], it belongs to the [[Senegambian languages|Senegambian]] branch within the [[Niger–Congo languages]], which does not have [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], unlike most other Niger–Congo languages. More broadly, it belongs to the [[Atlantic languages|Atlantic]] geographic grouping within Niger–Congo. It is spoken as a [[first language]] by the [[Fula people]] ("Fulani", {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}) from the [[Senegambia Confederation|Senegambia region]] and [[Guinea]] to [[Cameroon]] and [[Sudan]] and by related groups such as the [[Toucouleur people]] in the [[Senegal River]] Valley. It is also spoken as a [[second language]] by various peoples in the region, such as the [[Kirdi]] of northern Cameroon and northeastern [[Nigeria]].

==Nomenclature==
{{infobox ethnonym|Pullo|Fulɓe|Fulfulde}}
There are several names applied to the language, just as there are to the [[Fula people]]. They call their language '''Pulaar''' or '''Pular''' in the western dialects and '''Fulfulde''' in the central and eastern dialects. ''Fula(h)'' and ''Fulani'' in English come originally from [[Manding languages|Manding]] (esp. Mandinka, but also Malinke and Bamana) and [[Hausa language|Hausa]], respectively; ''Peul'' in French, also occasionally found in literature in English, comes from [[Wolof language|Wolof]].

==Morphology==
Fula is based on verbo-nominal roots, from which verbal, noun and modifier words are derived. It uses suffixes (sometimes inaccurately called [[infix]]es, as they come between the root and the inflectional ending) to modify meaning.  These suffixes often serve the same purposes in Fula that [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] do in English.

===Noun classes===
The Fula or Fulfulde language is characterized by a robust [[noun class]] system, with 24 to 26 noun classes being common across the Fulfulde dialects (Arnett 1975: 5). Noun classes in Fula are abstract categories with some classes having semantic attributes that characterize a subset of that class’ members, and others being marked by a membership too diverse to warrant any semantic categorization of the class’ members (Paradis 1992: 25). For example, there are classes for stringy long things, and another for big things, another for liquids, a noun class for strong rigid objects, another for human or humanoid traits etc. Gender does not have any role in the Fula noun class system and the marking of gender is done with adjectives rather than class markers (Arnett 1975: 74).  Noun classes are marked by suffixes on nouns. These suffixes are the same as the class name though they are frequently subject to phonological processes, most frequently the dropping of the suffix’s initial consonant (McIntosh 1984:45-46).

The table below illustrates the class name, the semantic property associated with class membership, and an example of a noun with its class marker. Classes 1 and 2 can be described as personal classes, classes 3-6 as diminutive classes, classes 7-8 as augmentative classes, and classes 9-25 as neutral classes. It is formed on the basis of McIntosh’s 1984 description of Kaceccereere Fulfulde, which the author describes as "essentially the same" as Arnott’s 1970 description of the noun classes of the Gombe dialect of Fula. Thus, certain examples from Arnott also informed this table (Arnott 1975: 5), (McIntosh 1984:44).

===Voice===
Verbs in Fula are usually classed in 3 [[voice (grammar)|voices]]: active, middle, and passive.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Not every root is used in all voices. Some middle voice verbs are [[reflexive verb|reflexive]].

A common example are verbs from the root ''loot-'':
* ''lootude'', to wash (something) [active voice]
* ''lootaade'', to wash (oneself) [middle voice]
* ''looteede'', to be washed [passive voice]

===Consonant mutation===
Another feature of the language is initial [[Consonant mutation#Fula|consonant mutation]] between singular and plural forms of nouns and of verbs (except in Pular, there is no consonant mutation in verbs, only in nouns).

A simplified schema is as follows:
* w ↔ b ↔ mb
* r ↔ d ↔ nd
* y ↔ j ↔ nj
* w ↔ g ↔ ng
* f ↔ p
* s ↔ c
* h ↔ k

===Pronouns===
Fula has [[Inclusive and exclusive we#Fula language|inclusive and exclusive]] first-person plural pronouns.  The inclusive pronouns include both the speaker and those being spoken to, while the exclusive pronouns exclude the listeners.

The pronoun that corresponds to a given noun is determined by the noun class.  Because men and women belong to the same noun class, the English pronouns "he" and "she" are translated into Fula by the same pronoun.  However, depending on the dialect, there are some 25 different noun classes, each with its own pronoun.  Sometimes those pronouns have both a nominative case (i.e., used as verb subject) and an accusative or dative case (i.e., used as a verb object) as well as a possessive form.  Relative pronouns generally take the same form as the nominative.

==Varieties==
{{Main|Maasina Fulfulde|Pular language|Pulaar language}}

While there are numerous varieties of Fula, it is typically regarded as a single language.  Wilson (1989) states that "travelers over wide distances never find communication impossible," and Ka (1991) concludes that despite its geographic span and dialect variation, Fulfulde is still fundamentally one language.&lt;ref&gt;"...malgré son extension géographique et ses variations dialectales, le fulfulde reste une langue profondément unie." Ka, Fary. 1991. "Problématique de la standardisation linguistique: Le cas du pulaar/fulfulde." In N. Cyffer, ed., ''Language Standardization in Africa''.  Hamburg: Helmut Buske verlag. Pp. 35-38.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[Ethnologue]]'' has found that nine different translations are needed to make the Bible comprehensible for most Fula speakers, and it treats these varieties as separate languages. They are listed in the box at the beginning of this article.

==Status==
Fulfulde is an official language in Senegal ''(Pulaar)'', an official [[lingua franca]] in Guinea, Senegambia, Maasina, North Eastern Nigeria and Northern Cameroon (''Pular''), where many speakers are bilingual, and a national language in many African countries, such as Mauritania, Mali, Gambia, Guinea (Conakry), Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Togo, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger...

== Writing systems ==
{{Main|Fula alphabets}}

=== Latin alphabet ===
When written using the [[Latin script]], Fula uses the following additional special "hooked" characters to distinguish meaningfully different sounds in the language: Ɓ/ɓ {{IPAblink|ɓ}}, Ɗ/ɗ {{IPAblink|ɗ|ɗ&amp;thinsp;}}, Ŋ/ŋ {{IPAblink|ŋ}}, Ɲ/ɲ {{IPAblink|ɲ|&amp;thinsp;ɲ}}, Ƴ/ƴ {{IPAblink|ʔ|ʔʲ}}. The letters [[c]], [[j]], and [[r]], respectively represent the sounds [c], [ɟ], and [r]. Double vowel characters indicate that the vowels are elongated. An apostrophe (ʼ) is used as a glottal stop. It uses the five vowel system denoting vowel sounds and their lengths. In Nigeria ʼy substitutes ƴ, and in Senegal Ñ/ñ is used instead of ɲ.{{clarify|date=February 2013}}

====Sample Fula alphabet====
'''[[a]], [[aa (digraph)|aa]], [[b]], [[mb (digraph)|mb]], [[ɓ]], [[c]], [[d]], [[nd (digraph)|nd]], [[ɗ]], [[e]], [[ee (digraph)|ee]], [[f]], [[g]], [[ng (digraph)|ng]], [[h]], [[i]], [[ii (digraph)|ii]], [[j]], [[nj (digraph)|nj]], [[k]], [[l]], [[m]], [[n]], [[ŋ]], [[ɲ]] [[ny (digraph)|(ny]] '''or '''[[ñ]]''')''', [[o]], [[oo (digraph)|oo]], [[p]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[uu (digraph)|uu]], [[w]], [[y]], [[ƴ]], [[']]'''

The letters '''[[q]], [[v]], [[x]], [[z]]''' are used in some cases for loan words. &lt;!-- need verification; I removed these from the main list because in at least some dialects they are not part of the alphabet --&gt; In the Pular of Guinea an additional letter, '''[[ɠ]]''' [ɠ], is also part of the orthography, but it is also only used for loan words.

=== Arabic script ===
Fula has also been written in the [[Arabic script]] or ''[http://www.mafindi.com/blogs/1/10/how-to-write-fulfulde-in-ajami-baleri-e-masle Ajami]'' since before colonization by many scholars and learned people including [[Usman dan Fodio|Usman dan fodio]] and the early emirs of the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate|northern Nigeria]] emirates. This continues to a certain degree and notably in some areas like [[Guinea]] and [[Cameroon]]. (citation?)

In fact, Fula retains many [[Arabic]] [[loanwords]].

There were unsuccessful efforts in the 50s and 60s to create a unique script to write Fulfulde. In the 1990s, two teenage brothers, Ibrahima and Abdoulaye Barry from the [[Nzérékoré Region]] of Guinea, created the [[adlam script]], which accurately represents all the sounds of Fulani. The script is written from right to left and includes 28 letters with 5 vowels and 23 consonants.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;''[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-alphabet-that-will-save-a-people-from-disappearing/506987/ The Alphabet That Will Save a People From Disappearing]'', [[Kaveh Waddell]], Nov 16, 2016, [[The Atlantic]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Randall M.

Hansa was elected to Bombay Schools Committee in 1926 and became president of [[All India Women's Conference]] in 1945–46.

A '''harbor''' or '''harbour''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-our.2C -or|spelling differences]]; synonyms: '''wharves''', '''haven''') is a sheltered [[body of water]] where [[ship]]s, [[boat]]s, and [[barge]]s can be docked. The term ''harbor'' is often used interchangeably with ''[[port]]'', which is a man-made facility built for loading and unloading vessels and dropping off and picking up passengers. Ports usually include one or more harbors. [[Alexandria Port]] in [[Egypt]] is an example of a port with two harbors.

Harbors may be natural or artificial. An artificial harbor can have deliberately constructed [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]s, [[sea wall]]s, or [[jetty]]s or they can be constructed by [[dredging]], which requires maintenance by further periodic dredging. An example of an artificial harbor is [[Long Beach Harbor]], [[California]], [[United States]] which was an array of [[salt marshes]] and [[tidal flats]] too shallow for modern [[merchant ships]] before it was first dredged in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geology.campus.ad.csulb.edu/people/bperry/geology303/geol303chapter8.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223191432/http://geology.campus.ad.csulb.edu/people/bperry/geology303/geol303chapter8.html |archivedate=2014-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a natural harbor is surrounded on several sides by [[prominence]]s of land. Examples of natural harbors include [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia and [[Trincomalee Harbour]] in Sri Lanka.

==Artificial harbors==

Artificial harbors are frequently built for use as ports. The oldest artificial harbor known is the Ancient Egyptian site at [[Wadi al-Jarf]], on the Red Sea coast, which is at least 4500 years old (ca. 2600-2550 BC, reign of King Khufu). The largest artificially created harbor is [[Jebel Ali]] in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513075-1|last=Hattendorf|first=John B.|title=The Oxford encyclopedia of maritime history|year=2007|page=590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other large and busy artificial harbors include: 
* [[Port of Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]]; 
* [[Port of Houston]], [[Texas]], United States;
* [[Port of Savannah]], [[Georgia (US State)|Georgia]], United States;
* [[Port of Long Beach]], California, United States;  
* [[Port of Los Angeles]] in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], California, United States.

The Ancient Carthaginians constructed fortified, artificial harbors called [[cothon]]s.

==Natural harbors==
[[File:Natural harbor in Vizhinjam 930218630 a6a5d892d0 o.jpg|thumb|A natural harbor in [[Vizhinjam]], [[India]]]]
[[File:Shipbuilding yard.jpg|thumb|[[Visakhapatnam]] Natural Harbor]]
A natural harbor is a [[landform]] where a part of a body of water is protected and deep enough to furnish anchorage. Many such harbors are [[ria]]s. Natural harbors have long been of great [[military strategy|strategic naval]] and [[economic]] importance, and many great cities of the world are located on them. Having a protected harbor reduces or eliminates the need for breakwaters as it will result in calmer waves inside the harbor. Some examples are:
{{div col}}
* [[Port Hercules]] in [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]];
* [[Pago Pago Harbor]] in [[American Samoa]];
* [[New York Harbor]] in the United States;
* [[Presque Isle Bay]] in [[Pennsylvania]], United States;
* [[Tampa Bay]] in [[Florida]], United States;
* [[Boston Harbor]] in [[Massachusetts]], United States
* [[Poole Harbour]] in England, [[United Kingdom]]; 
* [[Kingston Harbour]] in [[Jamaica]]; 
* [[Grand Harbour]] in [[Malta]]; 
* [[Marsamxett Harbour]] in Malta; 
* [[Subic Bay]] in [[Zambales]], the [[Philippines]]; 
* [[Scapa Flow]] in [[Scotland]], United Kingdom;
* [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] in [[Australia]]; technically a ria
* [[Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]], United States; 
* [[Trincomalee Harbour]] in [[Sri Lanka]]; 
* [[San Francisco Bay]] in California, United States; 
* [[Visakhapatnam Port|Visakhapatnam Harbour]] in India; 
* [[Killybegs]] in [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]]; 
* [[Halifax Harbour]] in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]];

* [[Cork Harbour|Cork Harbour, Ireland]];
* [[Waitemata Harbour]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand;
* [[Port of Tobruk]] in [[Tobruk]], [[Libya]];
* [[Victoria Harbour]] in [[Hong Kong]].
{{div col end}}

== Ice-free harbors==
For harbors near the [[geographical pole|North and South Poles]], being ice-free is an important advantage, especially when it is year-round. Examples of these include: 
* [[Murmansk, Russia]]; 
* [[Pechenga, Russia]]; 
* [[Liinakhamari|Liinakhamari, Russia]]; 
* [[Hammerfest (town)|Hammerfest, Norway]]; 
* [[Vardø (town)|Vardø, Norway]]; 
* [[Vostochny Port]]; 
* [[Nakhodka]] in [[Nakhodka Bay|Nakhodka Bay, Russia]]; 
* [[Prince Rupert Harbour]], Canada. 
The world's southmost harbor, located at Antarctica's [[Winter Quarters Bay]] (77° 50′ South), is potentially ice-free, depending on the summertime [[pack ice]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2000/00OPP.htm U.S. Polar Programs] National Science Foundation FY2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hello''''' is a [[salutation]] or [[greeting habits|greeting]] in the [[English language]]. It is first attested in writing from 1826.&lt;ref name="oed-hello"&gt;{{cite OED|term=hello|id=85687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early uses==
''Hello'', with that spelling, was used in publications in the US as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the ''[[Norwich Courier]]'' of [[Norwich, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="oed-hello"/&gt; Another early use was an 1833 American book called ''The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee'',&lt;ref&gt;(Anonymous). [https://books.google.com/books?id=RZsOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=hello&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1400&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=1838&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html ''The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee''.] New York: J. &amp; J. Harper, 1833. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; which was reprinted that same year in ''[[Literary Gazette|The London Literary Gazette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NVsZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA803&amp;dq=hello&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1400&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=1838&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html "''The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee''."] '' The London Literary Gazette; and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences, &amp;c.'' No. 883: 21 December 1833. p. 803.&lt;/ref&gt; The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hello] Origin of the word.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''hello'' is an alteration of ''hallo'', ''hollo'',&lt;ref name="oed-hello"/&gt; which came from [[Old High German]] "''halâ'', ''holâ'', emphatic imperative of ''halôn'', ''holôn'' to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|term=hallo|id=83588}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also connects the development of ''hello'' to the influence of an earlier form, ''holla'', whose origin is in the French ''holà'' (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French ''là'' 'there').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|term=holla|id=87735}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in addition to ''hello'', ''halloo'',&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Mann, ''[https://archive.org/details/historyofcommonw00butl A History of the Commonwealth of Kentucky]'', Wilcox, Dickerman &amp; Co., 1834, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; ''hallo'', ''hollo'', ''hullo'' and (rarely) ''hillo'' also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hollo Merriam-Webster: Hollo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hullo Merriam-Webster: Hullo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hillo Merriam-Webster: Hillo]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephone===
The use of ''hello'' as a [[telephone]] greeting has been credited to [[Thomas Edison]]; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard ''Hullo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.collectorcafe.com/article_archive.asp?article=800&amp;id=1507 |title=The First "Hello!": Thomas Edison, the Phonograph and the Telephone – Part 2 |author=Allen Koenigsberg |work=Antique Phonograph Magazine |volume=VIII |issue=6 |accessdate=2006-09-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116211033/http://www.collectorcafe.com/article_archive.asp?article=800&amp;id=1507 |archivedate=16 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Graham Bell]] initially used ''[[Ahoy (greeting)|Ahoy]]'' (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~klong/papers/hello.txt|title=All Things Considered|author=Allen Koenigsberg|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=2006-09-13|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=etymology&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hello&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |work=etymonline.com
 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]:

{{quote|Friend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.
What you think? Edison - P.S. first cost of sender &amp; receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectorcafe.com/article_archive.asp?article=800&amp;id=1507 |title=The First "Hello!": Thomas Edison, the Phonograph and the Telephone – Part 2 |author=Allen Koenigsberg |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.&lt;ref name=etymology/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/05/garden/great-hello-mystery-is-solved.html|title=Great 'Hello' Mystery Is Solved|last=Grimes|first=William|date=5 March 1992|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2017-10-25|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hullo===
''Hello'' might be derived from ''hullo'', which the American [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary describes as a "chiefly British variant of hello,"&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hullo |title=hullo - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=2009-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. ''Hullo'' is found in publications as early as 1803.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=27sCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=hullo&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1760&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=1804&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html ''The Sporting Magazine.''] London (1803).

===Hallo and hollo===
{{Redirect|Hallo}}
''Hello'' is alternatively thought to come from the word ''hallo'' (1840) via ''hollo'' (also ''holla'', ''holloa'', ''halloo'', ''halloa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/hello|title=Hello|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online|accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of ''hollo'' is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a [[fox hunt|hunt]] when the quarry was spotted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/hollo|title=Hollo|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online|accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{quote|If I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.|''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'' (I.viii.7), [[William Shakespeare]]}}

[[Fowler's]] has it that "hallo" is first recorded "as a shout to call attention" in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fowler's'', revised third edition by R. W. Burchfield, Oxford University Press.  {{ISBN|0-19-860263-4}}, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is used by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s famous poem ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' written in 1798:
{{quote|
And the good south wind still blew behind,&lt;br /&gt;
But no sweet bird did follow,&lt;br /&gt; 
Nor any day for food or play &lt;br /&gt;
Came to the mariners' hollo!}}

In many [[Germanic languages]], including [[German language|German]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], "''hallo''" literally translates into English as "hello". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter from [[Willem Bilderdijk]] to his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.&lt;ref&gt;Bilderdijk, Willem  [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/bild002lief01_01/bild002lief01_01_0107.php?q=hallo ''Liefde en ballingschap. Brieven 1795-1797''] (ed. Marita Mathijsen). Uitgeverij De Arbeiderspers, Amsterdam/Antwerp 1997&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Webster's dictionary]] from 1913 traces the etymology of ''holloa'' to the Old English ''halow'' and suggests: "Perhaps from ah + lo; compare Anglo Saxon ealā."

According to the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'', ''hallo'' is a modification of the obsolete ''holla'' (''stop!''), perhaps from Old French ''hola'' (''ho'', ho! + ''la'', there, from Latin ''illac'', that way).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartelby.com/61/60/H0136000.html|title=Hello|publisher= The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.|year=2000|accessdate=2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old English verb, hǽlan (1. wv/t1b 1 to heal, cure, save; greet, salute; gehǽl! Hosanna!), may be the ultimate origin of the word.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.comcast.net/~modean52/oeme_dictionaries.htm OEME Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; Hǽlan is likely a cognate of German Heil (meaning ''complete'' for things and ''healthy'' for beings) and other similar words of Germanic origin.  [[Bill Bryson]] asserts in his book ''Mother Tongue'' that "hello" comes from Old English ''hál béo þu'' ("Hale be thou", or "whole be thou", meaning a wish for good health) (see also "goodbye" which is a contraction of "God be with you".

=="Hello, World" computer program==
{{Main|"Hello, World!" program}}
Students learning a new computer programming language will often begin by writing a [["Hello, World!" program]], which does nothing but issue the message "Hello, world" to the user (such as by displaying it on a screen). This popular tradition arose from an introductory chapter of the book ''[[The C Programming Language]]'' by Kernighan &amp; Ritchie, which reused the following example taken from earlier memos by Brian Kernighan at Bell Labs:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 int main() 
 {
        printf("hello, world");
 }&lt;/source&gt;

'''Highland Oaxaca Chontal''', or ''Chontal de la Sierra de Oaxaca'', is one of the [[Indigenous people of Oaxaca#Chontal|Chontal]] languages of [[Oaxaca]]. It is sometimes called ''Tequistlatec'', but is not the same as [[Tequistlatec language|Tequistlatec proper]], which is extinct.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
Highland Chontal has a medium-sized inventory of 23 native consonants, along with four borrowed consonants from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] /β ð ɾ r/. It distinguishes [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] consonants, including the cross-linguistically unusual ejective [[Voiceless labiodental fricative|labiodental fricative]] /f'/.

Turner (1966) transcribes the ejective lateral affricate [{{IPA|tɬʼ}}] as an ejective fricative /{{IPA|ɬʼ}}/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Highland Chontal Grammar|last=Turner|first=Paul Raymond|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the ejective labiodental fricative /{{IPA|fʼ}}/ might likewise be a phonetic affricate [p̪fʼ] or similar. 

The placeless [[voiceless nasal]] /ɴ̥/ assimilates to the [[place of articulation]] of the consonant following it, e.g. /ɴ̥t/ &gt; [n̥t]. Thus it has four allophones [m̥ n̥ ɲ̊ ŋ̊]. Its place of articulation before glottal consonants, vowels or pause is unclear, if it occurs in these environments at all.

=== Vowels ===
Highland Chontal has an inventory of five vowels, an arrangement similar to Spanish and many other world languages:
{| class="wikitable"
!
![[Front vowel|Front]]

|- style="text-align: center;"

|
|{{IPA link|o̞|o}}
|- style="text-align: center;"
![[Open vowel|Open]]
|
|{{IPA link|ä|a}}
|
|}
The distinction between /e/ and /a/ is neutralized before /j/.

There is no [[Hiatus (linguistics)|vowel hiatus]] (since all syllables begin with a consonant), nor any phonemic diphthongs.

'''Horizontal blanking interval''' refers to a part of the process of displaying images on a computer monitor or [[television]] [[display device|screen]] via [[raster scanning]]. CRT screens display images by moving beams of electrons very quickly across the screen. Once the beam of the monitor has reached the edge of the screen, the beam is switched off, and the deflection circuit voltages (or currents) are returned to the values they had for the other edge of the screen; this would have the effect of retracing the screen in the opposite direction, so the beam is turned off during this time. This part of the line display process is the Horizontal Blank.&lt;ref name="tveng" /&gt;&lt;ref name="analogtv" /&gt; 

In detail, the Horizontal blanking interval consists of:
* [[front porch]] – blank while still moving right, past the end of the scanline,
* [[sync pulse]] – blank while rapidly moving left; in terms of amplitude, "blacker than black".
* [[back porch]] – blank while moving right again, before the start of the next scanline. [[Colorburst]] occurs during the back porch, and unblanking happens at the end of the back porch.

In the [[NTSC]] television standard, horizontal blanking occupies {{val|10.9|ul=us}} (17.2%) out of every {{val|{{#expr:572/9 round 1}}|u=us}} scan line.  In [[PAL]], it occupies {{val|12|u=us}} (18.8%) out of every {{val|64|u=us}} scan line.

In the PAL television standard, the blanking level corresponds to the [[black level]], whilst other standards, most notably NTSC, set the black level slightly above the blanking level on a 'pedestal'.

== HBlank effects ==

Some graphics systems can count horizontal blanks and change how the display is generated during this blank time in the signal; this is called a [[raster effect]], of which an example are [[raster bar]]s.

In video games, the horizontal blanking interval was used to create some notable effects. Some methods of [[parallax scrolling]] use a raster effect to simulate depth in consoles that do not natively support multiple background layers or do not support enough background layers to achieve the desired effect. One example of this is in the game [[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood]], which was written for the [[TurboGrafx-16#TurboGrafx-CD|PC Engine CD-ROM]] which does not support multiple background layers. The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]'s [[Mode 7]] used the horizontal blanking interval to vary the scaling and rotation of one background layer on a scanline by scanline basis to create many different effects. The most famous and hyped effect of Mode 7 was to turn the background layer into a planar [[Texture mapping|texture map]].

'''Ibrahim Sheme''' is a bilingual Nigerian writer, journalist, filmmaker and publisher. He worked as editor and correspondent of many Nigerian newspapers, including ''[[Leadership (Nigeria)|Leadership]]'', ''[[The Tide (Nigeria)|The Tide]]'', ''New Nigerian'', ''The Reporter'' and ''Hotline Magazine''.&lt;ref name="Sheme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheme appointed NOUN spokesperson|url=https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/news/next-level/sheme-appointed-noun-spokesperson/142553.html|website=dailytrust.com.ng|publisher=Daily Trust|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ibrahim Sheme - 'I was really overjoyed'|url=http://everythinliterature.blogspot.com.ng/2007/12/ibrahim-sheme-i-was-really-overjoyed.html|publisher=EverythinLiterature|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also authored the official biography of the late Major-General [[Shehu Musa Yar’Adua]]. He was pioneer editor of ''[[Blueprint Newspaper]]'' and later its editor-in chief. Sheme has been the Director of Media and Publicity at the [[National Open University of Nigeria]] since 2016&lt;ref name="Sheme 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ibrahim Sheme|url=http://nouedu.net/officers/mal-ibrahim-sheme|website=nouedu.net|publisher=National Open University of Nigeria|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheme" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Sheme was born in Faskari Local Government Area, [[Katsina State]], in 1966 or 1967. He attended Maigamji Primary School and Ruwan-Godiya Primary School, both in Funtua Local Government Area in the old Kaduna State (now in Katsina State, between 1973–1979, and finished his secondary school education at Government College, Kaduna, in 1984. He received his undergraduate degree in Mass Communication from [[Bayero University]], Kano (BUK), in 1989. In the university, he was amongst the leading literary activists and served as both the editor-in-chief of The Parakeet, a literary journal, and editor of the Bayero Beacon, the official campus newspaper. He also served as secretary-general of the Katsina State Students Association. On graduation, he was awarded the two prizes for the Best Graduating Student in his faculty and the overall graduating student of the university.

In 1993, after working as a journalist in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, and Kaduna, Sheme proceeded to the [[University of Wales, Cardiff|University of Wales]] in Cardiff, United Kingdom, where he received Master of Arts in [[Communication Studies]] in 1994. Sheme served as national publicity secretary of the [[Association of Nigerian Authors]].&lt;ref name="Sheme" /&gt;

==Literary activities==
Sheme is one of the leading authors and literary critics in northern Nigeria. His first novel, "Kifin Rijiya" (The Ignoramus), which he wrote while still a student in Bayero University and was published in 1991, won second position in the Northern Languages Novel Writing Competition organised by the Kaduna State government.

His second novel, "'Yartsana" (The Doll), won the first place prize in the maiden Bashir Karaye Prize for Hausa Writing. His other works include "The Malam's Potion"_(a collection of short stories), a travelogue on his tour of Israel and the Palestinian territories titled "Ilmi Mabudin Tafiya", a biography of the late Major-General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, and a biography of the late Alhaji Mamman Shata titled "Shata Ikon Allah!" He also edited an anthology of short stories for the Association of Nigerian Authors titled "Cramped Rooms and Open Spaces".

Sheme was a central figure in the debate over Hausa romance fiction which raged in several newspapers and magazines in northern Nigeria between 1991 and 1999. The highly popular discourse, called "The Great Soyayya Debate", pitched writers, academics and literary critics such as Ibrahim Malumfashi, [[Abdalla Uba Adamu]], Yusuf M. Adamu, [[Ado Ahmad Gidan Dabino]], and others on the efficacy and need for the romance novels known as "soyayya books". Sheme initiated the debate as acting editor cum literary editor of Nasiha, the Hausa weekly newspaper being published by Nationhouse Press (publishers of The Reporter newspaper) in Kaduna. He took the debate to other media houses where he subsequently worked as editor or literary editor: Hotline and Rana magazines, New Nigerian, Weekly Trust, and Leadership newspaper. The debate attracted the attention of Nigerian and foreign scholars such as Professor Graham Furniss of the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, who documented it.

In the mid-'90s, Sheme served as the national publicity secretary of Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA). He was also the pioneer secretary-general of ANA in Kaduna State.

==Filmmaking activities==
Ibrahim Sheme has been linked to the robust filmmaking industry in northern Nigeria known as Kannywood. He wrote the script for many Hausa movies and even produced some. His movies include Gagarabadau (Unbeatable), Daren Farko (The First Night), and Fargaba (Fear). Sheme also wrote songs for several singers in Kannywood.

His most notable activity in Kannywood, however, has been the publication of the two leading newsmagazines, Fim and Bidiyo. Fim (meaning Film) was set up by Sheme and some friends of his in March 1999, with Sheme as the publisher. He was to take over the monthly magazine as sole owner in 2002 and has been publishing it without fail since then. The magazine publishes news, interviews, gossip, etc., about stakeholders in the industry, but it later expanded its coverage to Hausa culture in general, with a section on traditional music, creative writing, and craft. The section was actually created after the death of Bahaushiya, a quarterly magazine founded by Sheme in 2006 to fill a void. The magazine Bidiyo (Video), which Sheme founded with a focus solely on the art of filmmaking, was rested after 10 editions due to low patronage because the readers preferred the scintillating gossip and lifestyle news Fim magazine provides. But Fim has suffered low sale in recent years due to the pervasive encroachment of the social media in journalism generally. From over 10,000 copies monthly sale, it has come down to a few hundred. However, there has been a marked shift by the magazine to operate its news-selling business online – in its website and social media handles.

A '''jib''' is a triangular sail that sets ahead of the [[mast (sailing)|foremast]] of a [[Sailing ship|sailing vessel]]. Its [[Tack (sailing)|tack]] is fixed to the [[bowsprit]], to the [[bow (ship)|bows]], or to the [[Deck (ship)|deck]] between the bowsprit and the foremost mast. Jibs and [[spinnaker]]s are the two main types of [[headsails]] on a modern boat.

==Modern yachts and small craft==
[[File:Jib vs genoa.svg|thumb|right|A '''jib''', left, compared to a [[genoa (sail)|genoa]], right. The foretriangle is outlined in red.]]
Boats may be sailed using a jib alone, more commonly jib(s) make a minor direct contribution to propulsion, compared to a [[main sail]]. Generally, a jib's most crucial function is as an [[airfoil]], increasing performance and overall stability by reducing [[turbulence]] on the main sail's [[leeward]] side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gentry|first=Arvel|title=A Review of Modern Sail Theory|date=September 12, 1981|url=http://ljjensen.net/Maritimt/A%20Review%20of%20Modern%20Sail%20Theory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On boats with only one jib, it is common for the [[Parts of a sail#The corners|clew]] of the jib to be abaft the mast, meaning the jib and mainsail overlap. An overlapping jib is called a ''genoa jib'' or simply a [[genoa (sail)|genoa]] (see illustration). These are efficiently used when [[reaching (sailing)|reaching]] more broadly than a [[close reach]]. Alternatively, a boat may carry smaller jibs, to compensate aerodynamics when the main sail is [[reef (sail)|reefed]]; these more rugged sails are called ''storm jibs'' or ''spitfires''.&lt;ref name=oct&gt;{{cite book |last=Torrey |first=Owen C., Jr. |authorlink = |title =Sails |publisher =Palmer &amp; Oliver |volume = |edition =Seamen's Bank for Savings |date =1965 |location =New York |pages =20–25,36&amp;37 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a boat with two [[staysail]]s the inner sail is called the ''staysail'', and the outer (foremost) is called the jib. This combination of two staysails is called a ''cutter rig'' (or in North America a ''yankee pair'') and a boat with one mast rigged with two staysails and a mainsail is called a [[cutter (ship)|cutter]].

On cruising yachts, and nearly all racing sailboats, the jib needs to be worked when tacking. On these yachts, there are two sheets attached to the [[Parts of a sail#The corners|clew]] of the jib. As the yacht comes [[Points of sail#Head to wind|head to wind]] during a tack, the active sheet is released, and the other sheet (the ''lazy sheet'') on the other side of the boat is pulled in. This sheet becomes the new ''active sheet'' until the next tack.

==Traditional vessels==
[[File:Krusenstern bowsprit jibs.jpg|thumb|Three of the four jibs are in pink.]]
[[Schooner]]s typically have up to three jibs. The foremost one sets on the topmast [[forestay]] and is generally called the ''jib topsail'', a second on the main forestay is called ''the jib'', and the innermost is called ''the staysail''. Actually, all three sails are both jibs and [[staysail]]s in the generic sense.

Original usage in 18th and 19th century [[square rig|square-rigged]] ships distinguished between the fore staysail, set on the [[Stays (nautical)|forestay]] running from the foremast head to the ship's peak, the foremost part of the hull, and the jibs set on stays running to the bowsprit. Jibs, but not staysails, could also be "set flying," i.e. not attached to the standing rigging. Sails set beyond the peak were typically called jibs, set on stays running from the fore [[topmast]] to the [[bowsprit]], or the fore [[topgallant mast]] to the [[jibboom]] or even the fore royal mast to the flying jibboom. A large [[square rig|square-rigged]] ship typically has four jibs, but could have as many as six.&lt;ref name=mayne1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayne|first1=Richard|title=The Language of Sailing|date=2000|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|isbn=1-57958-278-8|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=king256&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Dean|title=A Sea of Words|date=2000|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=978-0-8050-6615-9|page=256|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From forward to aft, these sails are called:
* Jib of jibs
* Spindle jib
* Flying jib
* Outer jib
* Inner jib
* Fore ([[topmast]]) staysail.&lt;ref name=mayne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=king256/&gt;

The first two were rarely used except by [[clipper ships]] in light winds and were usually set flying.&lt;ref name=mayne1/&gt;&lt;ref name=king256/&gt; A storm jib was a small jib of heavy canvas set to a stay to help to control the ship in bad weather.&lt;ref name=mayne1/&gt;

==Idiom==
The jib is referenced in the idiom usually spoken as "I like the cut of your jib", generally seen as signifying approval of one's general appearance or respect for their character. The phrase alludes to the maritime practice of identifying far-away ships by noting the "cut" (general shape and configuration) of their sails to determine their status as friend or foe. One such report from the ''[[Naval Chronicle]]'' (1805)—"we perceived by the cut of their sails, then set, that they were French Ships of War"—is often cited as an early inspiration for the idiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Clarke|editor1-first=James Stanier|editor2-last=Jones|editor2-first=Stephen|editor3-last=Jones|editor3-first=John|title=Biographical Memoir of the Late Honourable Captain Richard Walpole|journal=Naval Chronicle|date=1805|volume=14|page=97|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=xnAMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 May 2018|publisher=J. Gold}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=“Three Sheets to the Wind” &amp; “Cut of Your Jib”|url=http://disappearingidioms.com/three-sheets-to-the-wind-cut-of-your-jib/|website=Disappearing Idioms|accessdate=6 May 2018|date=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] used the expression to denote approval in the 1824 novel ''[[St. Ronan's Well]]'': "If she disliked what the sailor calls the ''cut of their jib''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Gary|title=Cut of your jib|url=https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/cut-of-your-jib.html|website=The Phrase Finder|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Russell Bartlett]] later defined the idiom in his 1848 ''Dictionary of Americanisms'' as "The form of his profile, the cast of his countenance". This usage alludes to a frequent variation of meaning which describes approval, specifically, of the shape of one's [[nose]], which roughly approximates the frontal position and triangular shape of the jib sail on a boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robson|first1=Martin|title=Not Enough Room to Swing a Cat: Naval slang and its everyday usage|date=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781844861965|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEGkDAAAQBAJ|accessdate=6 May 2018|chapter=Cut of his jib}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Juan Fernández de Heredia.jpg|thumb|Heredia as portrayed in his ''[[Grant Cronica d'Espanya]]''.]]
[[File:Grant Cronica de Espanya.jpg|thumb|Juan Fernández de Heredia: ''[[Grant Cronica d'Espanya]]'', 1385-1396.]]
'''Juan Fernández de Heredia''' (in [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] ''Johan Ferrández d'Heredia'', pronounced {{IPA-an|ˈtʃwan feˈrand̪eθ deˈɾedʝa}}; {{circa|1310}} &amp;ndash; 1396) was the [[Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]] from 24 September 1377 to his death. His tenure was occupied by the "affair of Achaea", the persistent, but ultimately fruitless, efforts by the Knights to acquire the [[Principality of Achaea]] in southern Greece. He was also a great patron of the translation and composition of historiographical works in the [[Aragonese language]] and a counsellor to two [[Kings of Aragon]].

==Early life==
Heredia was born in [[Munebrega]], [[Kingdom of Aragon]]. As a knight of the Hospitaller order (from 1328), Heredia was the commander of the castles of [[Villel]], [[Aliaga, Aragon|Aliaga]], and [[Alfambra]]. He was originally patronised by [[Peter IV of Aragon]] and [[Pope Innocent VI]]. Through the aid of the latter, he was appointed to govern the [[Tongue (Knights Hospitaller)|grand priories]] of the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of León|León]], and of the abbey of [[Saint-Gilles, Gard|Saint-Gilles]] in southern France, the richest priory of the order. He supported Peter IV against the [[Union of Aragon]] and fought on his side in the successful [[Battle of Epila]] (1348). 

In 1346, with the king of Aragon's support, he gained the [[castellany]] of [[Amposta]] (which was the priory of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]]). Heredia made himself and his family (and illegitimate children) enormously wealthy at the expense of the order. His power and influence was greatly circumscribed by the Grand Master [[Raymond Berengar (Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller)|Raymond Berengar]], but in 1371 he entered the favour of [[Pope Urban V]] and was elevated as the master's lieutenant in Western Europe.

==Campaigns in Greece==
In 1376, Heredia conducted the fleet bearing [[Pope Gregory XI]] back to [[Rome]], presaging the end of the [[Avignon Papacy]]. The next year, on September 24, Gregory formally appointed Heredia grand master, following the death of [[Robert of Juilly]] on July 27. Heredia embarked from [[Naples]] for [[Latin Empire|Romania]] late in 1377, arriving in [[Vonitsa]] in April 1378. Heredia immediately set about to take [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] but was captured by [[Ghin Boua Spata]], lord of [[Aetolia]] and [[Acarnania]], and sold to the [[Ottoman Turks]]. He was quickly ransomed, for he was in [[Glarentsa]] on 20 May 1379, though during his absence, his commandant, [[Gaucher of La Bastide]], hired the [[Navarrese Company]] of mercenaries and brought them to the [[Principality of Achaea]] for eight months. 

After his release, Heredia went to [[Rhodes]], the headquarters of the order, in July. Power was readily ceded to him, as he was an adherent of the Avignonese [[Pope Clement VII]]. Heredia tried to make a deal to have the Navarrese turn over the castles they were holding in the name of the prince to the military order. The Navarrese' preponderant demands, however, quickly sunk any possible agreement. Heredia ignored the powerful company and instead dealt directly with [[Marie of Blois]], who claimed the principality on behalf of her son [[Louis II of Naples]]. Marie signed over her son's rights to the order on 24 January 1387, with the consent of Clement VII. The transaction cost the order 20,000 gold ''[[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]]''. Later, the pope reversed his endorsement at the request of the Achaean claimant [[Amadeus, Lord of Pinerolo]]. 

[[File:Caspe - Juan Fernandez de Heredia01.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to Heredia, preserving the memory of his tombstone, destroyed during the [[Spanish Civil War]].]]

Despite these failures with the Navarrese, Heredia had continued to use them in his war. Though Peter IV had forbid any Hospitallers of his realm to travel with Heredia east, he himself had claimed the rights to the [[Duchy of Athens]]. The Navarrese, under [[Juan de Urtubia]], attacked [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], the capital of the duchy, and Heredia, though friendly with the king, was warned in a letter to stop abetting his enemies (10 September 1380). 

==Life in Avignon==
Heredia spent most of his life in [[Avignon]] after 9 April 1382, when he embarked for the West with his powers diminished some by the untrusting convent in Rhodes. In April 1383, the Roman [[Pope Urban VI]] appointed [[Riccardo Caracciolo]], prior of [[Capua]], anti-master in opposition to Heredia. Caracciolo had the support of some Italian priories, of the [[Kingdom of England|England]] and other Urbanist regions, but his power was insignificant by his death in 1395, after which no one was elected to replace him. Heredia did not long survive him and was succeeded by [[Philibert of Naillac]]. 

Heredia was wealthy and learned, a patron of historiography and translation. It was he who ordered the ''[[Chronicle of Morea]]'' translated into [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] sometime before 1393, though it does not contain any mention of his term of service in the Morea. The medieval stonework of his fortified castles in [[Mora de Rubielos]] and [[Rubielos de Mora]] has been much studied in the last few years. He was buried in [[Caspe]]. His tomb was destroyed by anarchist soldiers during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939), although some photographs remain.

'''Kilit''' is an extinct Iranian dialect of Azerbaijan that is closely related to [[Talysh language|Talysh]]. It is probably a dialect of Iranian [[Tati language (Iran)|Tati]], otherwise found only in Iran. It was spoken in the villages around [[Kilit, Ordubad|Kilit]], located 12 kilometers southwest from the city of [[Ordubad (city)|Ordubad]] in a [[Ordubad Rayon|district]] with the same name of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] in [[Azerbaijan]]. It was still used by non-native speakers as a second language in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=stilo&gt;Stilo, D. L. 1994.  Phonological systems in contact in Iran and Transcaucasia. In ''Persian studies in North America: Studies in Honor of Mohammad Ali Jazayery'' By Muhammed Ali Jaza'iri, Mehdi Marashi, Mohammad Ali: Festschrift Jazayery, Published by Ibex Publishers, Inc., p. 90. {{ISBN|0-936347-35-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-936347-35-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222090430/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 |date=2009-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The language has been long known to the [[Russians|Russian]] historians and travelers since the middle of nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries. The historian Chopin, first mentioned it back in 1852.  He states the inhabitants of the village as amounting to 104. Zelinsky researched on the language in 1880 afterwards. In the 1950s a few speakers was reported who used the language probably only as a trade lingo or secret language. In 1966, A. G. Gasanov collected a few words and phrases.&lt;ref name="Farroukh"&gt;[http://www.interkavkaz.info/index.php?s=79fb9824c44a4c801f1cece28c93aedf&amp;act=Print&amp;client=wordr&amp;f=20&amp;t=6252 Sources of kilit language (Источники о килитском языке)]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the possibility of a migration cannot be ruled out, however it is more likely, given more data about Tatic languages and proto-Tatic, that this group extended at least as far as the areas in which the remanent languages are spoken today.&lt;ref name=stilo /&gt;

== The identity ==

Chopin remarks that the inhabitants of Kilit village were professing [[Shiite]] faith and their language is not similar to any of the other local dialects. However he has been puzzled about their origin. He mentioned that they might be from [[Armenians|Armenian]] origin or more likely [[Talysh people|Talyshi]], [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat]], [[Tajiks (disambiguation)|Tajik]] or [[Zoroastrian]].&lt;ref name=shopen&gt;Shopen, Ivan, 1852. Istoricheskiĭ pamiatnik sostoianiia Armianskoĭ-oblasti v ėpokhu eia prisoedineniia k Rossiĭskoĭ-Imperii. Published by V tip. Imp. Akademii nauk. P. 539 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zelinsky considered it as a mixture of Kurdish, Persian and Arabic. Gasanov called it with a certain affinity towards  Iranian languages. But only Zelinsky's materials are enough to understand that kiliti is not an argot, possesses an independent grammatical structure and have the main base of the root words and all the typical features of the Iranian languages.  The existing materials also provide a sufficient basis to determine it as belonging to the northwestern Iranian group of languages. That language had no written tradition. According to Zelinsky, dozens of villages had spoken the language before, but it was just understandable to the villagers afterwards and then the [[Azerbaijani language]] replaced it.&lt;ref name="Farroukh" /&gt;&lt;ref name=zelinsky /&gt;

D’ailleurs, en mars 1998, le voyage en Afrique du premier président américain (Bill Clinton) à visiter ce continent est venu encore confirmer que les «terres francophones» s'ouvrent maintenant à la compétition politique, économique et culturelle. La preuve en est que maintenant ce sont les Américains qui soutiennent militairement le Rwanda, et ce, de manière très active."
English translation: Since the end of the Cold War, Africa has become even more "visible" to the United States and the bilateral relations France has long maintained with many African nations thus find themselves profoundly changed (read diminished). Moreover, in March 1998, a trip to Africa by the first U.S. president (Bill Clinton) to visit the continent again confirmed that the "francophone lands" are now open to political, economic and cultural competition.&lt;/ref&gt; has meant an increase in the use of English by a higher proportion of the population and administration.

In 2008 the government changed the medium of education from French to English.&lt;ref&gt;http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/rwanda&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018 the Rwandan government introduced French as a foreign language classes at the primary school level, and members of the upper classes still used French.

[[File:Masai Woman.jpg|thumb|Masai woman]]

'''Maasai''' (Masai) or '''Maa''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|m|ɑː|s|aɪ}};&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[Endonym|autonym]]:&lt;/small&gt; ''ɔl Maa'') is an [[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern Nilotic]] language spoken in Southern [[Kenya]] and Northern [[Tanzania]] by the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] people, numbering about 800,000. It is closely related to the other [[Maa languages|Maa varieties]]: [[Samburu language|Samburu]] (or Sampur), the language of the [[Samburu people]] of central Kenya, [[Chamus language|Chamus]], spoken south and southeast of Lake Baringo (sometimes regarded as a dialect of Samburu); and [[Kwavi people|Parakuyu]] of Tanzania. The Maasai, Samburu, il-Chamus and Parakuyu peoples are historically related and all refer to their language as ''ɔl Maa''.  Properly speaking, "Maa" refers to the language and the culture and "Maasai" refers to the people "who speak Maa."

The Maasai people, from the Eastern region of the African continent, have been protected from the widespread Westernization of agriculture and colonization because they inhabit a primarily desert area. Because the Maasai have resisted forms of colonization and Western expansion, their systems of communication and exchange revolve primarily around the trade they do within the tribe. Therefore, the spoken language is not only the most significant point of contact that the Maasai use but also one of the only ways that Maasai can continue to thrive in their traditional tribal way of life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meeting the Maasai|last=Nicholson|first=N|publisher=Journal of Management Inquiry|year=2005|isbn=|location=14 (3) 2005th ser.|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of the Maasai language, while not rapid, is happening as a result of close contact with other tribal groups in East Africa and the rise of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[English language|English]] as the dominant languages. In Tanzania, former President Nyerere encouraged the adoption of Swahili as an official language to unite the many different ethnic groups in Tanzania, as well as English to compete on a global scale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=McCabe, T. (2003). Sustainability and Livelihood Diversification among the Maasai of Northern Tanzania|journal=Human Organization|volume=62 (2) Summer 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Maasai language, often referred to as Maa, has survived despite the mass influx of English and Swahili education systems, economic plans, and more, the socioeconomic climate that the Maasai people face in East Africa keeps them, and their language, as an underrepresented minority.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Maasai way of life is embedded in their language. Specifically, the economic systems of trade that the Maasai rely on in order to maintain their nomadic way of life, relies on the survival of the Maasai language, even in its minority status. With language endangerment, the Maasai tribe would continue to be threatened and its cultural integrity threatened.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The minority status that the language currently faces has already threatened traditional Maasai practices. Fewer and fewer groups of Maasai continue to be nomadic in the region, choosing to settle instead in close knit communities to keep their language and other aspects of their culture alive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Phonology ==
The Maasai variety of ''ɔl Maa'' as spoken in southern [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] has 30 contrasting sounds, which can be represented and alphabetized as followsː ''a'', ''b'', ''ch'' (a variant of ''sh''), ''d'', ''e'', ''ɛ'', ''g'', ''h'', ''i'', ''ɨ'', ''j'', ''k'', ''l'', ''m'', ''n'', ''ny'', ''ŋ'', ''o'', ''ɔ'', ''p'', ''r'', ''rr'', ''s'', ''sh'' (with variant ''ch''), ''t'', ''u'', ''ʉ'', ''w'', ''wu'' (or ''ww''), ''y'', ''yi'' (or ''yy''), and the [[glottal stop]] ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (or ''ʔ'').

[[Tone (linguistics)|Tone]] is extremely important for conveying correct meaning in the Maasai language.

=== Consonants ===
In the table of consonant phonemes below, phonemes are represented with IPA symbols. When IPA conventions differ from symbols normally used in practical writing, the latter are given in angle brackets.

For some Maasai speakers, the voiced stop consonants are not particularly implosive (e.g. IlKeekonyokie Maa), but for others they are lightly implosive or have a glottalic feature (e.g. Parakuyo Maa). In Arusha Maa, {{IPA|/p/}} is typically realized as a voiceless fricative {{IPAblink|ɸ}}, but in some words it can be a voiced trill {{IPAblink|ʙ}}. At least in native Maa words, {{IPAblink|tʃ}} and {{IPAblink|ʃ}} occur in complementary distribution, with the former occurring directly after consonants and the latter elsewhere.

=== Vowels ===
Like the other Maa languages, Maasai has [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|advanced tongue root]] [[vowel harmony]]. There are nine contrasting vowels, with the vowel {{IPAslink|a}} being "neutral" for harmony.

== Syntax ==
Word order is usually [[verb–subject–object]], though order can vary because tone is the most important indicator of subject versus object. What really determines order in a clause is topicality; order in the most simple clauses can be predicted according to the information structure pattern: [Verb – Most.Topical – Less.Topical]. Thus, if the object is highly topical in the discourse (e.g. a first-person pronoun), and the subject is less topical, then the object will occur right after the verb and before the subject.

The Maasai language has only two fully grammatical [[prepositions]], but can use "relational nouns" along with a most general preposition to designate specific locative ideas. [[Noun phrase]]s begin with a [[demonstrative]] prefix or a gender-number prefix, followed by a quantifying noun or other head noun. Other modifiers follow the head noun, including [[possessive]] phrases.

In Maasai, many morphemes are actually tone patterns. For example:

:{|
| || ɛ́yɛ́tá || ɛmʊtí
|-
| Gloss: || remove.meat || pot.ACC
|-
| Translation: ||colspan=7| "She removed meat from the pot."
|}

:{|
| || ɛyɛ́ta || ɛmʊ́ti
|-
| Gloss: || remove.meat.MID || pot.NOM
|-
| Translation: ||colspan=7| "The pot is ''de-meated''."&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Thomas E. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=LC3DfjWfCiwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Describing morphosyntax: A guide for field linguists]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

The Maasai language carries three forms of gendered nouns; feminine, masculine, and place. Native speakers of the language attach a gendered prefix to a noun. The meaning of the noun in context then refers to its gender. Nouns place gender as follows:

"Who has come?" would be asked if the gender of the visitor were known. The noun would be preceded by a gendered prefix. If the gender of the visitor were unknown, "it is who that has come?" would be the correct [English translation] question. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://journals.linguisticsociety.org/elanguage/sal/article/download/1327/1327-2126-1-PB.pdf|title=MAASAI GENDER IN TYPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE|last=Payne|first=Doris|publisher=University of Oregon and Summer Institute of Linguistics|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=160-163|via=Studies in African Linguistics Volume 27, Number 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjectives in Maa serve only to describe the noun, and change tenses depending on the noun that they are describing. 

Pronouns in Maa usually assign gender (male, female, or place); if gender is unknown, the meaning of the noun in context will usually refer to a gender. For example, the context of a female might include working in the house while a male gender would be implied if the action referred to work outside the home. The Maasai language uses place as a personal pronoun because place can help identify male or female (i.e. an action occurring in the house will almost always be done by a female).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Consonants in Maasai are pronounced with a “gulp” sound. Tone helps to indicate the verb-subject-order agreement.

Present tense in Maasai includes habitual actions, such as “I wake up” or “I cook breakfast”. Past tense refers only to past action, not a specific time or place.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Maasai Language: an Introduction|last=Munke|first=David|publisher=Bloomington|year=2015|isbn=|location=IN|pages=1-15|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malvi''', or '''Malwi''', is a [[Rajasthani language]] spoken in the [[Malwa|Malwa region]] of India. It is closely related to  [[Nimadi]], which is spoken in the [[Nimar]] region of [[Madhya Pradesh]].

The dialects of Malvi are Ujjaini ([[Ujjain district|Ujjain]], [[Indore district|Indore]], [[Dewas district|Dewas]], [[Shajapur district|Shajapur]], [[Sehore district|Sehore]] districts), Rajawadi ([[Ratlam district|Ratlam]], [[Mandsaur district|Mandsaur]], [[Neemuch district|Neemuch]] districts), Umathwadi ([[Rajgarh district|Rajgarh]] district), and Sondhwadi ([[Jhalawar district|Jhalawar]] district). Ujjaini is the [[prestige dialect]], and the language as a whole sometimes goes by that name.

About 75% of the Malvi population can converse in [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]], which is the official language of the Madhya Pradesh state, and literacy rate in a second language such as Hindi is about 40%. There are many unpublished materials in this language.

'''''The Mantram Handbook''''' describes methods of using a [[mantram]] — sometimes called a Holy Name — in daily living. Benefits are also described. Written by [[Eknath Easwaran]], the book was originally published in the United States in 1977. Several subsequent editions have been published, sometimes under different titles, in the United States, the United Kingdom, and India. Foreign (non-English) editions have also been published in several languages.&lt;ref

| colspan="2" align="center" |'''Recommended Mantrams from Diverse Traditions*'''&lt;ref name=recommend09&gt;[[Easwaran]] writes that "I wouldn't suggest making up your own mantram.... Choose a mantram of proven power, one which has enabled many men and women before you to realize for themselves the unity of life. The roots of such a mantram are far deeper than we can know when we first begin to use it, and this is what enables it to grow in our consciousness.... All of the mantrams which I recommend are mantrams of proven power, bequeathed to us by the great spiritual teachers of many traditions." (pp. 28-29, ''Mantram Handbook'', 2009 edition, {{ISBN|978-1-58638-028-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;(discussed: ''Mantram Handbook'', chapter 3)&lt;/small&gt;

|}[[Eknath Easwaran|Easwaran's]] ''Mantram Handbook'' provides an introduction to the practice of repeating [[mantram]]s and/or [[Names of God|holy names]], terms the author uses interchangeably.&lt;ref name=minmantra&gt;Furthermore, "''[[Mantram]]'' and ''[[mantra]]'' are different forms of the same [[Sanskrit]] word. Both are correct." (p. 12, ''Mantram Handbook'', 2009 edition, {{ISBN|978-1-58638-028-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The book offers the author's practical guidance for choosing a mantram and using it for personal centering and spiritual growth. In the opening chapters, the author recommends selecting a single mantram (such as those in the table at right), and suggests that the reader "take your time choosing a mantram..... then, once you have chosen a mantram, do not change it."&lt;ref name=mh2009&gt;''Mantram Handbook'', 2009 edition, {{ISBN|978-1-58638-028-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} Most of the remainder of the book discusses how to integrate the mantram into daily living to improve skills and solve various types of problems. Late in the book, Easwaran describes how the mantram can be combined with other spiritual practices, such as meditation. Easwaran's approach is distinctive, in that he recommends a [[Passage Meditation|method of sitting meditation]] that does ''not'' focus on the mantram.&lt;ref name=baesler01/&gt; Accordingly, the entire concern of the ''Mantram Handbook'' is in how to use a mantram throughout the day, at times ''apart'' from sitting meditation.

With only slight variation,&lt;ref name=ed1var&gt;The first two editions (1977, 1985) lacked §1 ("Initiation into the mantram"), §2 ("Choosing a mantram"), and §6 ("Overcoming likes &amp; dislikes") that were included in third and subsequent editions. The first two editions also included two sections that were omitted from later editions: an initial section ("What the mantram is"), and a final section ("Suggestions for further reading").&lt;/ref&gt; each edition of the ''Mantram Handbook'' has contained the same 12 major parts:

|-valign="top"
|2.
|''Choosing a Mantram''
 |Discusses various tips for choosing a mantram. For example, "it is important to take into account your own background, your response to the meaning, and the practical significance of the words....

Six subsections include '[[Unconscious mind|below the surface of consciousness]]', 'a still mind', 'the mantram is a transformer', and 'the elephant and the bamboo'.&lt;ref name=elephant&gt;The Hindu tradition "will often compare the mind to the trunk of an elephant - restless, inquisitive, and always straying.... But the wise majout, if he knows his elephant well, will just give that trunk a short bamboo stick to hold on to before the procession starts. Then... The mind is very much like this. Most of the time it has nothing to hold on to, but we can keep it from straying into all kinds of absurd situations if we just give it the mantram" (pp. 75-76, ''Mantram Handbook'', 2009 edition, {{ISBN|9781586380281}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

|-valign="top"
|9. 
|''The Mantram at the Time of Death''.
 |At death, major religious traditions say that our individual consciousness merges into a divine reality "if we have been repeating the mantram... until it has become an integral part of our consciousness"&lt;ref name=mh2009/&gt;{{rp|134}} Five subsections include 'the significance of death', 'the mantram at the moment of death', 'the process of death'.

[[Passage Meditation|Meditation]] (on a memorized passage), 2. The Mantram, 3. Slowing down, 4. One-pointed attention, 5. Training the senses, 6. Putting others first, 7. Spiritual fellowship, 8. Spiritual reading.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-valign="top"
|12. 
|''Becoming Established in the Mantram''.
 |"Over a period of many years.... the mantram [can] become an integral part of your being, permeating your consciousness... [which corresponds to] what [[Saint Paul]] means by 'pray without ceasing'."&lt;ref name=mh2009/&gt;{{rp|181}} This "transforms our entire vision of life",&lt;ref name=mh2009/&gt;{{rp|189}} and "the joy of this state has to be experienced to be described"&lt;ref name=mh2009/&gt;{{rp|179}}

{{Eknath Easwaran}}The most recent (5th) US edition contains a foreword by [[Daniel H. Lowenstein (physician)|Daniel H. Lowenstein]].&lt;ref name=applegate&gt;The first US edition also contained a foreword by Richard B. Applegate.&lt;/ref&gt; Offering perspectives as a neurologist and medical educator, Lowenstein states that

{{quote |text=The science of neurobiology gives another way to understand how the mantram could be working. From studies using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] ([[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]), we know that concentrating on a short phrase will activate specific areas in the front and side of the brain. These areas, the [[frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[parietal lobe]]s, are involved in [[attention|selective attention]] - the capacity to maintain a single focus despite the presence of distracting stimuli.... as though the mantram provides access to a peaceful, grounded center that puts our cravings, drives, and other immediate needs in perspective.&lt;ref name=mh2009/&gt;{{rp|7}} }}

The book also contains an index.

[[Andrew Weil]] stated that the ''Mantram Handbook'' "is the only book I have seen on the use of mantram as a centering technique."&lt;ref name=weil04/&gt;{{rp|141}}

In the ''[[Business Standard]]'', Apratim Barua wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mantram Handbook... is concise, simple and practical.... Where Easwaran scores over other books of a similar type is in his non-sectarian approach and his appeal to common-sense.... Second, Easwaran's account is deeply personal and, therefore, all the more convincing. He has traversed the same path himself and is aware of all the snares and pitfalls. The tone of the book is cheerful, optimistic and positive.... The book is not merely about mantrams. Its aim is the cultivation of a more wholesome and positive approach to life.&lt;ref name=barua97/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Journal of Psychology and Christianity]]'', Doug Oman and Joseph Driskill wrote that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For people of any religious faith or none, Easwaran offers a highly practical yet consistently spiritual discussion of integrating a holy name into daily modern living. Presenting the most comprehensive practical discussion of how to draw upon a holy name throughout the day in a variety of ordinary and challenging situations, this book is also uniquely universal as a resource for professionals working with diverse populations.&lt;ref name=oman03/&gt;{{rp|15}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Hindu]]'', Anita Joshua wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Knowing full well the potential of the mantram in releasing new and positive energy that can help chase away seemingly incurable problems, Eknath Easwaran took upon himself the task of explaining it in the most simplest of terms and the way it works on the human system. And, at the outset itself, he explains that mantram is not exclusive to the Hindu religion.... He signs off by explaining how the mantram relates to a large body of spiritual disciplines ... [and] is particularly careful to differentiate such spiritual disciplines from dogmas.&lt;ref name=joshua97/&gt;{{rp|34}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also in ''[[The Hindu]]'', [[M. P. Pandit]] wrote that as an
&lt;blockquote&gt;
exponent of Eastern spiritual disciplines in the university circles in the West, Eknath Easwaran has evolved a style that makes abstruse concepts simple and appealing.... The author refutes the charge that the practice of mantra is self-hypnosis. It is not that any word repeated for a length of time will have the same results.... he explains mantra as 'that which enables us to cross the sea of the mind.' Actually the traditional derivation is ''mananat trayate'', helps to cross the ocean of ''[[samsara]]''.&lt;ref name=pandit93/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Economic Times]]'' (India) wrote that "Easwaran strips the mystery off the mantram and explains how it can help us gain the will and insight to refashion our lives":&lt;ref name=anon-econtimes97/&gt;{{rp|8}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The method Easwaran suggests is simple: pick a mantram of 'proven power' recommended by the great spiritual teachers of any religion that you follow. Easwaran makes no attempt to avoid references to religion and the aim of his technique is, in fact, to take one closer to God. Claims Easwaran: "Constant repetition and practice is required for the mantram to take root in our consciousness and gradually transform it, just as constant repetition makes the advertiser's jingle stick in our minds."... Even a sceptic could benefit from the solutions Easwaran puts forward.&lt;ref name=anon-econtimes97/&gt;{{rp|8}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''Journal of Ecumenical Studies'', E. James Baesler noted that "several of the eastern Christian and eastern Hindu traditions recommend reciting the Holy Name outside the predetermined prayer periods."&lt;ref name=baesler01/&gt;{{rp|~203}} Most also 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
recommend reciting the Holy Name during a time set apart exclusively for prayer.... The one exception to this pattern is Easwaran's &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Mantram Handbook''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; recommendation to recite the Holy Name at virtually all times except the time set apart for meditation/prayer. Easwaran's rationale... is that meditation times are for... the repetition of an inspirational passage, while repeating the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;mantram&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; does not require as much discipline and thus can be 'prayed' anytime.&lt;ref name=baesler01/&gt;{{rp|~203}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the ''[[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]]'', Thomas Weide wrote that "for a so-called handbook, the book mentions surprisingly few different mantrams, and omits much material commonly covered by mantram advocates."&lt;ref name=weide77/&gt;{{rp|206}} But Weide recommended the book "highly to the total transpersonal public, not just to mantram lovers,"&lt;ref name=weide77/&gt;{{rp|207}}  stating that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Easwaran writes with lovely simplicity about how to live a more spiritual life in general, and.... gives a splendid explanation of how mantrams work, how to choose one, and above all, how to work on oneself in general, using a mantram merely as one of several important practices.&lt;ref name=weide77/&gt;{{rp|206–7}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Apratim Barua (quoted above) expressed concern that "The title is a slight misnomer. The book is not merely about mantrams.... If anything, the number of mantrams discussed is woefully inadequate. He takes up some four in all [sic], one from each major religion.... This may be due to the fact that the aim of the book is the cultivation of a more wholesome and positive approach to life."&lt;ref name=barua97/&gt;

In ''Medical Self-Care'', [[Thomas William Ferguson|Thomas Ferguson]] wrote that the ''Mantram Handbook'' described "how mantrams work, how to choose one, and how to use it... Spiritual, non-sectarian, quietly delightful."&lt;ref name=ferguson79/&gt;{{rp|15}} ''[[Booklist]]'' wrote that "This guide by a Hindu expert on religions is refreshingly real. He also contradicts popular misconceptions about mantrams and gives practical advice."&lt;ref name=cf77/&gt;{{rp|440}}

==Research==
The ''Mantram Handbook'' was the primary instructional text in several research studies on mantram repetition conducted through the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]], by Jill Bormann and her colleagues.&lt;ref name=bormann10/&gt;&lt;ref name=bormann07/&gt;{{rp|101}}&lt;ref name=bormann09/&gt;{{rp|90}}&lt;ref name=otherbook&gt;According to Bormann &amp; Oman (2007, 2009), some more recent studies have used an alternative exposition of the same approach to mantram repetition: {{cite book

'''Moissaye Joseph Olgin''' (1878–1939) was a Russian-born writer, journalist, and translator in the early 20th century. He began his career writing for the Jewish press in support of the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|Russian Revolution]] in 1910. During the [[First World War]], he moved to the United States in 1915, settling in New York City, where he continued his career in Jewish journalism. Much of his work was in support of communism, and he was a founding member of the [[Workers Party of America|Workers Party]]. In 1922, he founded ''[[Morgen Freiheit|The Morning Freiheit]]'', and served as its editor until his death in 1939.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

==Early life==
Moissaye Joseph Olgin was born on March 24, 1878 in Buki,  [[Ukraine]] (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]) to Chaim Aaron Novominsky and Tsipe (Gelman) Novominsky, both of whom were of ethnic [[Jewish]] origins.&lt;ref name="Graveyard"&gt;Lawrence Kestenbaum (ed.), [http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/olden-oliven.html "Moissaye Olgin,"] The Political Graveyard.com Retrieved November 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked as a lumber camp employee.&lt;ref name="WhosWho"&gt;Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole, ''The American Labor Who's Who.'' New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Olgin received a traditional education in Hebrew. After a short period of self-study, he began his studies at the [[University of Kiev]] in 1900.

He was sympathetic to the causes of the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|Russian Revolution]], and first became active in the underground revolutionary movement during his studies at the University of Kiev. His writings for Jewish and revolutionary publications earned him some fame among the many [[Russian Jews]], who were heavily oppressed by the government of [[Czar Nicholas II|Tsar Nicholas II]]. He took part in a Jewish revolutionary student group known as "Freiheit" (Freedom).

In 1901 Olgin was elected chairman of the Students Central Committee. The tsarist regime ordered his arrest in April 1903 on a charge of organizing Jewish self-defense groups against anticipated [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms]].&lt;ref name="Leader1"&gt;The Staff of the Morning Freiheit. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/olgin/freiheit/olgin07.htm ''M.J. Olgin (1878–1939)''] from ''M.J. Olgin: Leader and Teacher.'' New York: Workers Library Publishers, December 1939. Retrieved February 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Olgin left the University of Kiev and went to [[Vilno]] as a member of the Vilno Committee of the Jewish [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]]. There he was arrested but released on bail. He then became a member of the editorial board of the Arbeiter Stimme (Labor's Voice). He was the author of all the proclamations issued by the Central Committee of the Bund during the Revolution of 1905 while at the same time he prepared literary compositions for the illegal Jewish press. While editing newspapers and working with these underground organizations he also wrote books, short stories and literary essays.&lt;ref name="Leader1"/&gt;

In 1907, he traveled to Germany to continue his studies at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. He continued his studies there until 1910, when he returned to Russia.&lt;ref name="WhosWho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leader1"/&gt;

Traveling in Germany at the onset of [[World War I]], he was unable to return to Russia, and immigrated to the United States in 1915.&lt;ref name="Leader1"/&gt;

==Career==
Shortly after arriving in the United States, Olgin became a regular contributor to the Jewish daily newspaper ''[[The Forward]]''.

Olgin became an American citizen in April 1920. He was a leading member of the [[Jewish Socialist Federation]] of the [[Socialist Party of America]] and was influential in leading the JSF out of the party at a special convention of the organization held in September 1921. Together with other defecting members of the JSF, Olgin thereafter entered the fledgling [[Workers Council]] organization, a small group of [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]] which rejected the conspiratorial "underground" form of organization of the then extant communist movement. Olgin ceased contributing to ''The Forward'' at this same time.

In April 1922, there was launched a new [[Yiddish|Yiddish-language]] newspaper, the Daily ''Freiheit'' (later the ''[[Morgen Freiheit|Morning Freiheit]]''). Olgin served as first editor of this publication, a position which he retained up until the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Communist"&gt;William Z. Foster and Earl Browder, "Moissaye Joseph Olgin: March 24, 1878 – November 22, 1939: Statement of the National Committee, Communist Party of the USA," ''The Communist,'' vol. 18, no. 12 (December 1939), p. 1138.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also contributed frequently to the Communist Party's English-language newspaper, ''The Daily Worker,'' and served as a special correspondent for the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party's]] daily, ''Pravda.''&lt;ref name="Communist" /&gt;

At the end of December 1922, the Workers Council group was among the organizations which were united into the [[Workers Party of America]] (WPA), a new "legal political party" affiliated with the underground Communist Party of America, and Olgin thereby entered the formal communist movement for the first time. Olgin was named to the governing Bureau of the Jewish Federation of this new organization. Olgin was a member of the governing Central Executive Committee of the WPA and its Executive Council from the time of the organization's formation.

Olgin was a frequent candidate for political office on behalf of the Communist Party. He first ran in 1924, when he was a candidate for [[New York State Assembly]] on the ticket of the Workers Party.&lt;ref name="WhosWho"/&gt; He ran for [[U.S. Congress]] in 1926, 1930, and 1934, and for New York Assembly again in 1927, 1929, 1933, and 1936.&lt;ref name="Graveyard"/&gt;

Although a bitter rival of [[Alexander Bittelman]] in the heated factional politics of the Jewish Federation in the early 1920s, by the middle of the decade, Olgin had emerged as a supporter of the political faction that was headed by [[William Z. Foster]], [[Earl Browder]], and his former foe.

Olgin made several trips to the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1937, he went to Paris as delegation to the International Yiddish Culture Congress which founded the World Alliance for Jewish Culture (YCUF). While in Paris, he addressed the Writers Congress.&lt;ref name="Leader1"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Following his trip to Paris, Olgin's health began to decline. After almost two years' illness, during which Olgin continued his work for the ''Freiheit'', as well as for the ''[[Daily Worker]]'' and as the American correspondent for ''[[Pravda]]'',&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; he had apparently improved in health enough to appear at [[Madison Square Garden]], on November 13, for his first public speech in several years.&lt;ref name="Leader1"/&gt; Following the speech, his health again declined, and he died at his home of a heart attack on November 22, 1939. He was buried in [[New Montefiore Cemetery]] near [[Farmingdale, New York]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leader1"/&gt;

Olgin was the author of numerous books and pamphlets in seven languages: English, Russian, German, French, Polish, Hebrew and Yiddish. It is not known whether some of these works were, in fact, translated by others. He wrote verse, essays, literary criticism and sociological studies. His books ''The Soul of the Russian Revolution'' and ''A Guide to Russian Literature'' and pamphlet ''Why Communism?'' achieved sales of nearly half a million in several languages.&lt;ref name="Leader1"/&gt;

Olgin translated several volumes of [[Lenin]]'s collected works from Russian into English; [[Friedrich Engels]]' ''[[The Peasant War in Germany]]'' from German into [[Yiddish]]; [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]]'s ''[[Ten Days That Shook the World]]'' from English into Yiddish; a volume of short stories from [[Polish language|Polish]] into Yiddish; two volumes of tales of [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]], the father of Jewish literature, from Hebrew into Yiddish; and [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Call of the Wild|Call of the Wild]]'' from English into Yiddish.&lt;ref name="Leader1"/&gt;

Olgin was known as one of the most enthusiastic proponents of the Stalinist current in American Communism. For example, he was the Party's expert on fighting Trotskyism (see reference to his book on that subject; below).

A '''newspaper stamp''' is a special type of [[postage stamp]] used to pay the cost of mailing [[newspaper]]s and other [[periodical]]s. Although many types were issued in the 19th century, typically representing rates reduced from regular mail, they generally fell out of use in the mid-20th century, as [[mail]] services began to arrange bulk handling directly with publishers.

The exact use of newspaper stamps varied; small-value stamps were generally intended to be affixed to [[newspaper wrapper]]s, in much the fashion of regular mail, but with values usually less than regular stamps. Higher values were used on bundles of newspapers, and later on [[receipt]]s.

The first newspaper stamp was issued by [[Austria]] in 1851, and a number of nations soon followed suit. The newspaper stamps of the [[United States]], in use from 1865 to 1898, were always intended for bulk shipments, and with face values ranging up to US$100, are the highest-value newspaper stamps.

Newspaper stamps seem to have been printed in great quantities, and almost all types are today inexpensive and easily acquired.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22420">The '''Novikov self-consistency principle''', also known as the '''Novikov self-consistency conjecture''' and [[Larry Niven]]'s '''law of conservation of history''', is a [[principle]] developed by Russian physicist [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov]] in the mid-1980s. Novikov intended it to solve the problem of [[paradox]]es in [[time travel]], which is theoretically permitted in certain solutions of [[general relativity]] that contain what are known as [[closed timelike curve]]s. The principle asserts that if an event exists that would cause a paradox or any "change" to the past whatsoever, then the [[probability]] of that event is zero. It would thus be impossible to create [[time paradox]]es.

==History==
Physicists have long known that some solutions to the theory of general relativity contain [[closed timelike curve]]s&amp;mdash;for example the [[Gödel metric]]. Novikov discussed the possibility of closed timelike curves (CTCs) in books he wrote in 1975 and 1983,&lt;ref&gt;See note 10 on p. 42 of Friedman et al., "Cauchy problem in space-times with closed timelike curves"&lt;/ref&gt; offering the opinion that only self-consistent trips back in time would be permitted.&lt;ref&gt;On p. 169 of Novikov's ''Evolution of the Universe'' (1983), which was a translation of his Russian book '' Evolyutsiya Vselennoĭ'' (1979), Novikov's comment on the issue is rendered by translator M.M Basko as "The close of time curves does not necessarily imply a violation of causality, since the events along such a closed line may be all 'self-adjusted'—they all affect one another through the closed cycle and follow one another in a self-consistent way."&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 paper by Novikov and several others, "Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves",&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;{{cite journal | first=John | last=Friedman |author2=Michael Morris |author3=Igor Novikov |author4=Fernando Echeverria |author5=Gunnar Klinkhammer |author6=Kip Thorne |author7=Ulvi Yurtsever | url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/3737/ | title=Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 42 | year=1990 | issue=6 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.42.1915 | pages=1915 | bibcode=1990PhRvD..42.1915F}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors state:

:The only type of causality violation that the authors would find unacceptable is that embodied in the science-fiction concept of going backward in time and killing one's younger self ("changing the past"). Some years ago one of us (Novikov&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) briefly considered the possibility that CTCs might exist and argued that they cannot entail this type of causality violation: events on a CTC are already guaranteed to be self-consistent, Novikov argued; they influence each other around a closed curve in a self-adjusted, cyclical, self-consistent way. The other authors recently have arrived at the same viewpoint.

:We shall embody this viewpoint in a ''principle of self-consistency,'' which states that ''the only solutions to the laws of physics that can occur locally in the real Universe are those which are globally self-consistent.'' This principle allows one to build a local solution to the equations of physics only if that local solution can be extended to a part of a (not necessarily unique) global solution, which is well defined throughout the nonsingular regions of the space-time.

Among the co-authors of this 1990 paper were [[Kip Thorne]], [[Mike Morris (physicist)|Mike Morris]], and Ulvi Yurtsever, who in 1988 had stirred up renewed interest in the subject of time travel in general relativity with their paper "Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Kip | last=Thorne |author2=Michael Morris |author3=Ulvi Yurtsever | journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 61 | issue=13| pages=1446–1449 | doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446 | title= Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition | year=1988 | url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/9262/1/MORprl88.pdf | bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M | pmid=10038800}}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed that a new general relativity solution known as a [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]] could lead to closed timelike curves, and unlike previous CTC-containing solutions, it did not require unrealistic conditions for the universe as a whole. After discussions with another co-author of the 1990 paper, John Friedman, they convinced themselves that time travel needn't lead to unresolvable paradoxes, regardless of the object sent through the wormhole.&lt;ref name = "time warps"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kip S. Thorne|title=Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzlrW6kytdoC&amp;pg=PA510&amp;lpg=PA511&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=Polchinski%27s+paradox&amp;dq=black+holes+and+time+warps#v=onepage&amp;q=Polchinski's%20paradox&amp;f=false|year=1994|publisher=W.W.

[[File:Grandfather paradox billiard ball.svg|thumb|right|150px|"Polchinski's paradox".]] [[File:Causal loop billiard ball.svg|thumb|right|150px|Echeverria and Klinkhammer's resolution]] By way of response, physicist [[Joseph Polchinski]] wrote them a letter arguing that one could avoid the issue of free will by considering a potentially paradoxical scenario involving a [[billiard ball]] sent back in time through a wormhole. In Polchinski's scenario, the billiard ball is fired into the [[wormhole]] at an angle such that, if it continues along its path, it will exit in the past at just the right angle to collide with its earlier self, knocking it off track and preventing it from entering the wormhole in the first place. Thorne would refer to this scenario as "[[Polchinski's paradox]]" in 1994.&lt;ref name = "timewarps"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thorne | first = Kip S. | authorlink = Kip Thorne | title = [[Black Holes and Time Warps]] | publisher = W. W. Norton | year= 1994 | isbn = 0-393-31276-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|510–511}}

Upon considering the scenario, two students at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] (where Thorne taught), Fernando Echeverria and Gunnar "The Hammer" Klinkhammer, arrived at a solution to the problem that managed to avoid any inconsistencies. In the revised scenario, the ball emerges from the future at a different angle than the one that generates the paradox, and delivers its younger self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole. This blow alters its trajectory by just the right degree, meaning it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self the necessary glancing blow. Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each situation. Later analysis by Thorne and [[Robert Forward]] illustrated that for certain initial trajectories of the billiard ball, there could actually be an infinite number of self-consistent solutions.&lt;ref name = "timewarps" /&gt;{{rp|511–513}}

Echeverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne published a paper discussing these results in 1991;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Fernando | last=Echeverria |author2=Gunnar Klinkhammer |author3=Kip Thorne | url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/6469/ | title=Billiard balls in wormhole spacetimes with closed timelike curves: Classical theory | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 44 | year=1991 | issue=4 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.44.1077 | pages=1077|bibcode = 1991PhRvD..44.1077E }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, they reported that they had tried to see if they could find ''any'' initial conditions for the billiard ball for which there were no self-consistent extensions, but were unable to do so. Thus it is plausible that there exist self-consistent extensions for every possible initial trajectory, although this has not been proven.&lt;ref name = "earman"&gt;{{cite book | last = Earman | first = John | title = Bangs, Crunches, Whimpers, and Shrieks: Singularities and Acausalities in Relativistic Spacetimes | publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 1995 | isbn = 0-19-509591-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|184}} This only applies to initial conditions outside of the chronology-violating region of spacetime,&lt;ref name = "earman" /&gt;{{rp|187}} which is bounded by a [[Cauchy horizon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nahin | first =Paul J. | title = Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction | publisher =American Institute of Physics |year= 1999 | pages = 508 | isbn = 0-387-98571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could mean that the Novikov self-consistency principle does not actually place any constraints on systems outside of the region of space-time where time travel is possible, only inside it.

Even if self-consistent extensions can be found for arbitrary initial conditions outside the Cauchy Horizon, the finding that there can be multiple distinct self-consistent extensions for the same initial condition—indeed, Echeverria et al. found an infinite number of consistent extensions for every initial trajectory they analyzed&lt;ref name = "earman" /&gt;{{rp|184}}—can be seen as problematic, since classically there seems to be no way to decide which extension the laws of physics will choose. To get around this difficulty, Thorne and Klinkhammer analyzed the billiard ball scenario using quantum mechanics,&lt;ref name = "timewarps" /&gt;{{rp|514–515}} performing a quantum-mechanical sum over histories ([[path integral formulation|path integral]]) using only the consistent extensions, and found that this resulted in a well-defined probability for each consistent extension. The authors of ''Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves'' write:

:The simplest way to impose the principle of self-consistency in quantum mechanics (in a classical space-time) is by a sum-over-histories formulation in which one includes all those, and only those, histories that are self-consistent. It turns out that, at least formally (modulo such issues as the convergence of the sum), for every choice of the billiard ball's initial, nonrelativistic [[wave function]] before the [[Cauchy horizon]], such a sum over histories produces unique, self-consistent probabilities for the outcomes of all sets of subsequent measurements. ... We suspect, more generally, that for any quantum system in a classical wormhole spacetime with a stable Cauchy horizon, the sum over all self-consistent histories will give unique, self-consistent probabilities for the outcomes of all sets of measurements that one might choose to make.

==Assumptions==
The Novikov consistency principle assumes certain conditions about what sort of time travel is possible. Specifically, it assumes either that there is only one [[Chronology|timeline]], or that any alternative timelines (such as those postulated by the [[many-worlds interpretation|many-worlds]] [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]) are not accessible.

Given these assumptions, the constraint that time travel must not lead to inconsistent outcomes could be seen merely as a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], a self-evident truth that can not possibly be false. However, the Novikov self-consistency principle is intended to go beyond just the statement that history must be consistent, making the additional nontrivial assumption that the universe obeys the same local laws of physics in situations involving time travel that it does in regions of space-time that lack closed timelike curves. This is clarified in the above-mentioned "Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves",&lt;ref name="friedman" /&gt; where the authors write:

:That the principle of self-consistency is not totally tautological becomes clear when one considers the following alternative: The laws of physics might permit CTCs; and when CTCs occur, they might trigger new kinds of local physics which we have not previously met. ... The principle of self-consistency is intended to rule out such behavior. It insists that local physics is governed by the same types of physical laws as we deal with in the absence of CTCs: the laws that entail self-consistent single valuedness for the fields. In essence, the principle of self-consistency is a principle of no new physics. If one is inclined from the outset to ignore or discount the possibility of new physics, then one will regard self-consistency as a trivial principle.

==Implications for time travelers==
The assumptions of the self-consistency principle can be extended to hypothetical scenarios involving intelligent time travelers as well as unintelligent objects such as billiard balls. The authors of "Cauchy problem in spacetimes with [[closed timelike curve]]s" commented on the issue in the paper's conclusion, writing:

:If CTCs are allowed, and if the above vision of theoretical physics' accommodation with them turns out to be more or less correct, then what will this imply about the philosophical notion of free will for humans and other intelligent beings? It certainly will imply that intelligent beings cannot change the past. Such change is incompatible with the principle of self-consistency. Consequently, any being who went through a wormhole and tried to change the past would be prevented by physical law from making the change; i.e., the "free will" of the being would be constrained. Although this constraint has a more global character than constraints on free will that follow from the standard, local laws of physics, it is not obvious to us that this constraint is more severe than those imposed by standard physical law.&lt;ref name="friedman" /&gt;

Similarly, physicist and astronomer J. Craig Wheeler concludes that:

:According to the consistency conjecture, any complex interpersonal interactions must work themselves out self-consistently so that there is no paradox. That is the resolution. This means, if taken literally, that if time machines exist, there can be no free will. You cannot will yourself to kill your younger self if you travel back in time. You can coexist, take yourself out for a beer, celebrate your birthday together, but somehow circumstances will dictate that you cannot behave in a way that leads to a paradox in time. Novikov supports this point of view with another argument: physics already restricts your free will every day. You may will yourself to fly or to walk through a concrete wall, but gravity and condensed-matter physics dictate that you cannot. Why, Novikov asks, is the consistency restriction placed on a time traveler any different?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wheeler | first = J.

==Time-loop logic==
Time-loop logic, coined by [[roboticist]] and futurist [[Hans Moravec]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html|title=Time Travel and Computing|author=Hans Moravec|year=1991|accessdate=2008-07-28|authorlink=Hans Moravec}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a hypothetical system of computation that exploits the Novikov self-consistency principle to compute answers much faster than possible with the standard model of [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] using [[Turing machine]]s. In this system, a computer sends a result of a computation [[time travel|backwards through time]] and relies upon the self-consistency principle to force the sent result to be correct, provided the machine can reliably receive information from the future and provided the algorithm and the underlying mechanism are [[Formal verification|formally correct]]. An incorrect result or no result can still be produced if the time travel mechanism or algorithm are not guaranteed to be accurate.

A simple example is an [[iterative method]] algorithm. Moravec states:

{{blockquote| Make a computing box that accepts an input, which represents an approximate solution to some problem, and produces an output that is an improved approximation. Conventionally you would apply such a computation repeatedly a finite number of times, and then settle for the better, but still approximate, result. Given an appropriate negative delay something else is possible: [...] the result of each iteration of the function is brought back in time to serve as the "first" approximation. As soon as the machine is activated, a so-called "fixed-point" of F, an input which produces an identical output, usually signaling a perfect answer, appears (by an extraordinary coincidence!) immediately and steadily. [...] If the iteration does not converge, that is, if F has no fixed point, the computer outputs and inputs will shut down or hover in an unlikely intermediate state.}}

===Quantum computation with a negative delay===

Physicist [[David Deutsch]] showed in 1991 that this model of computation could solve NP problems in [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial time]],&lt;ref name="Deutsch1991"&gt;{{cite journal | first=David | last=Deutsch | url= http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197 | title= Quantum mechanics near closed timelike lines | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 44 | issue = 10 | year=1991 | doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197 | pages=3197–3217 | bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scott Aaronson]] later extended this result to show that the model could also be used to solve [[PSPACE]] problems in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American|date=March 2008|title=The Limits of Quantum Computers|pages=68–69|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/limitsqc-draft.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Scott | last=Aaronson |author2=John Watrous | url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/ctc.pdf | title=Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society A | volume = 465 | year=2009 | issue = 2102 | doi=10.1098/rspa.2008.0350 | pages=631–647 | bibcode=2009RSPSA.465..631A|arxiv = 0808.2669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch shows that quantum computation with a negative delay&amp;mdash;backwards time travel&amp;mdash;produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning.&lt;ref name="Deutsch1991" /&gt; Researchers published in 2014 a simulation in which they claim to have validated Deutsch's model with photons.&lt;ref name=RingbauerEtAl2014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martin Ringbauer|author2=Matthew A.

However, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's self-consistency condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic [[quantum field theory]] even on spacetimes which do not admit closed timelike curves, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's model is really characteristic of quantum processes simulating closed timelike curves in the sense of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Bangkok Sign Language''' (also known as '''Old''' or '''Original Bangkok Sign Language''')  is a [[deaf-community sign language]] of Thailand that arose among deaf people who migrated to [[Bangkok]] for work or family. 
The language is moribund, with all speakers born before 1960. Younger generations have switched to [[Thai Sign Language]], which seems to have arisen as a mixture of Old Bangkok SL and [[American Sign Language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1955">[[File:Bram Bilo 1890.jpg|thumb|A collection of Bram Bilo stories published in 1890]]

'''Philippe Le Sueur Mourant''' (1848 – 21 August 1918) was a [[Jersey]] writer who wrote in [[Jèrriais]] and [[French language|French]].

He was born in [[Saint Saviour, Jersey|St Saviour]] in 1848 and spent most of his early life working in agriculture in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] and [[Lorient]]. He returned to Jersey in 1880 and launched a series of stories in ''La Nouvelle Chronique de Jersey'' which took the form of letters supposedly written by ''Bram Bilo'', a naïve and self-important ex-[[Centenier]] from [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|St Ouen]]. These stories achieved great popularity (some remain classics, such as "''Bram Bilo à la vendue''" (Bram Bilo at the auction)) and a selection were republished in book form.

Besides writing in Jèrriais in ''La Nouvelle Chronique de Jersey'', he also wrote in French under the pen name ''Samuel'' in ''La Chronique de Jersey''.

He killed off his Bram Bilo character, and in 1911 he launched a new set of comical characters, the Pain family, in a series of Jèrriais stories in the [[English language]] newspaper ''Morning News''. In contrast to the countryside character of Bram Bilo, the Pains (Peter and Laizé and their hapless daughter Lonore) represented a family moved from the country to the bustling capital of [[Saint Helier]] with its anglicised society and entertainments. Some of the Pain stories were reprinted in ''La Chronique de Jersey'', but the series subsequently transferred to the ''[[Jersey Evening Post|Evening Post]]''.

A '''pinfall''' is a victory condition in various forms of [[professional wrestling]] that is met by holding ('''pinning''') an opponent's [[shoulder]]s on the wrestling mat, usually until the referee counts to three. In professional wrestling, a pinfall is a common method of winning a match.

The count is broken (a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Near-fall|near-fall]]) if the opponent manages to raise one or both of his shoulders off of the mat, commonly by ''kicking out'' (throwing their legs up to cause their shoulders to rise from the mat). In some positions, a wrestler may ''bridge'' (arching their back so that only their feet and the top of their head are touching the ground) to put more of their weight on the pinned opponent or to prop themselves up from being pinned.  Sometimes, an attacking wrestler may (illegally) hook the opponent's tights for extra leverage. Another popular illegal tactic of [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] wrestlers is to attempt a pin close to the ring ropes so they can prop their legs (or on rare occasions, arms) up on the ropes to gain additional [[lever]]age, putting more weight on the opponent.  On the other hand, a pin fall attempt cannot occur in the first place when one rolls out of the ring if falls do ''not ''count anywhere, or if the opponent lies on his/her stomach upon impact, so it would take extra effort to roll the opponent over, even when he/she is knocked out cold due to the body being effectively a dead weight.

==Pinning techniques==
==={{anchor|Back slide}} Backslide===
[[File:Backslide pin.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A backslide pin]]
[[File:WrestleMania_31_2015-03-29_19-24-51_ILCE-6000_DSC09542_(17495906423).jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[The Undertaker]] pinning [[Bray Wyatt]] with his signature variation pinfall crossing the opponent's arms across their chest after his finishing move, the [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Kneeling reverse piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]], also called called the "Rest In Peace" pin.]]

The attacking wrestler stands back-to-back with their opponent and hooks both of the opponent's arms. They then lean forward and drop to their knees, sliding the opponent down their back so that their shoulders are against the mat and their chin is against their chest. The attacker holds the opponents arms down with their own arms for the pin.

===Cover===
Also known as a '''lateral press''', '''cross press''', or simply as the '''basic pin'''. With an opponent lying face-up on the mat, the attacking wrestler lies face-down across the opponent's chest to hold them down. Sometimes, when both wrestlers are exhausted or badly hurt the attacking wrestler will cover with just an arm or lie down face up rather than face down. The term ''floatover'' (when in reference to a pin) refers to an attacking wrestler using the momentum of a throw or slam they are performing to propel themselves over the opponent into the lateral press position. A variation commonly used by [[The Undertaker]] sees the wrestler cross the opponent's arms across their chest, similar to a corpse. This is sometimes called a "Rest In Peace" pin, though there is no official name.&lt;ref&gt;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/672340-wwe-13/64382190&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cradle===
The attacking wrestler lies across the opponents chest and hooks a leg with the arm on the opposite side (left leg with right arm or right leg with left arm). Holding the leg gives the attacker greater leverage and thus makes it harder for the opponent to kick out. This was derived from the inside cradle and outside cradle in amateur wrestling.

===Crucifix===
An attacking wrestler hooks the arms of an opponent, by grapevining their legs around one arm and their arms around the other. This positions the attacking wrestler horizontally across the back of the opponent and forces the opponent's arms out like a [[crucifixion]]. The attacking wrestler then lowers their bodyweight so that the opponent is brought down to the mat backwards and is forced on to his own shoulders in a pinning position with his legs in the air. 

A variation on the standard crucifix, the crucifix bomb or crucifix driver, sees an attacking wrestler violently force their bodyweight downwards to throw the opponent into the mat with greater impact.

===Delfin Clutch===
The Delfin Clutch has an attacking wrestler crossing the arms of the opponent across their own chest while they're lying on their back on the mat. The attacking wrestler then kneels down on one knee on the opponent's arms, pinning the opponent's shoulders down to the mat. The attacking wrestler then grabs the opponent's legs, crosses them, and places them under one of their armpits, bending the opponent to a pinning predicament.

===Gannosuke Clutch===
The Gannosuke Clutch has an attacking wrestler facing the opponent, grabbing their arm, twisting it into a modified [[hammerlock]] and then performing a front somersault while holding the trapped arm in place as well as [[legsweep]]ing the opponent's near leg, rolling the opponent backwards while the attacking wrestler keeps the hammerlock applied while also holding the opponent's near leg down with their own leg. This move is also known as an arm trap somersault cradle. This was innovated and popularized by [[Mr. Gannosuke]], who named it after himself.

===Gedo Clutch===
The Gedo Clutch has an attacking wrestler sit kneeling on the back of an opponent who is lying face down and facing the same way. The attacking wrestler then grabs the opponent's arms and lifts them over their thighs, similar to a [[Professional wrestling holds#Camel clutch|camel clutch]]. The attacker then grabs hold of the opponent's head and pushes it down and forward between his legs, while leaning himself forward onto his stomach, flipping the opponent over onto their shoulders, with the attackers legs pinning the opponent down to the mat. This hold is technically known as a double leg nelson. It was innovated by [[Gedo (wrestler)|Gedo]].

===Jackknife hold===
The hold has the opponent wrestler lying on their back. Standing at the feet of the opponent, the attacking wrestler then lifts the opponent's legs from behind the knees. Still gripping the opponent's legs, the attacking wrestler then flips forward, over the opponent, and plants their feet on the mat while bridging the back to add leverage.

A variation of the jackknife hold, known as the figure four pin, has the attacker placing the opponent's legs in a [[Figure-four (grappling hold)|figure four]] position before executing the bridge.

===La magistral===
Also referred to as la casita or as bandito, this move's technical name is arm-wrench inside cradle pin and it is performed with the opponent on their hands and knees. From this position, the attacking wrestler stands next to the opponent's hip, grabs one arm and applies an [[Professional wrestling holds#Armbar|armbar]]. The attacking wrestler then steps over the arm with his inside leg so that he is facing away from the opponent. The attacking wrestler continues his turning motion and dives forward over the opponent, rolling onto their side. The barred arm acts as a lever, flipping the opponent over the attacker and onto his back. The attacker hooks one or both legs as the opponent goes over and holds for the pin.

===Oklahoma roll===
Not to be confused with the O'Connor roll, which is a roll-up. The attacking wrestler stands to the side of his opponent, who is on his hands and knees. The attacker hooks one arm around the opponent's neck and one between the legs, and rolls over the opponent. The attacker lands on his back or side, and the opponent is flipped so that his shoulders are pressed against the mat.

===Prawn hold===
Similar to a [[#Rana|rana]], except that the attacking wrestler is standing, bent over the opponent with both legs hooked pressing his weight down, it also exist of a variation with the attack wrestler bridging while the count is on. This pin is typically the result of a [[powerbomb]].

===Rana===
[[File:Rana pin.jpg|thumb|right|Implementation of a ''rana'' pin.]]
Also known as the '''double leg cradle''' (from the original spanish ''rana'', meaning Frog), is the technical term for the pinning position which results from a [[Professional wrestling holds#Sunset flip|sunset flip]] or a [[professional wrestling throws#Hurricanrana|hurricanrana]]. 

In the sunset flip version the opponent is lying shoulders down on the mat, almost completely flat on his back, with the attacking wrestler applying the pin sits below the legs of the opponent and uses his own legs to cover the opponent's shoulders or arms, and hooks both legs around the opponent's thighs to force his weight down to the mat.

The other variation, which usually results from a hurricanrana, sees the one performing the hurricanrana sit on the opponent's chest and hook the opponent's legs behind him whilst hooking the opponent's arms with his legs. This variation is the same hold just with the attacking wrestler on top. This interchangeability often sees a [[Spot (professional wrestling)|spot]] where the wrestlers change their weight distribution to move from one pinning hold to the other for a succession of near falls.

===Roll-up===

Not to be confused with a schoolboy pin. The attacking wrestler holds their opponent from behind in a waistlock. The attacking wrestler then performs a backward roll while holding the waistlock. The opponent ends up on their shoulders with the attacking wrestler sitting on top of their legs holding the opponent down. This move is often done when the opponent is leaning on the ropes facing out of the ring and the attacking wrestler would first push forward into the ropes with the waistlock in order to generate faster backward motion. A common heel tactic is to grab the back of the opponents clothing or tights while sitting on top of them or to use the ropes for leverage, thus making the pin illegal.

It is sometimes called the '''O'Connor roll''', after [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)|Pat O'Connor]]'s usage of the move; but O'Connor himself dubbed the move a "reverse rolling cradle". [[Bob Backlund]] also performed this move and additionally bridged over the opponent at the end of the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matysik|first1=Larry|authorlink=Larry Matysik|title=50 Greatest Professional Wrestlers of All Time: The Definitive Shoot|date=1 Feb 2013|publisher=ECW Press|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=TFFB1LAMbN8C|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://i60.tinypic.com/21ebuk8.jpg --&gt;

===Schoolboy===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TarynTerrellSchoolGirl.jpg|thumb|[[Taryn Terrell]] performing a schoolgirl on [[Taeler Hendrix]]]] --&gt;
Not to be confused with a roll-up. The [[Professional wrestling throws#Schoolboy sweep|schoolboy sweep]] sees the attacking wrestler drop down behind the opponent and put one arm up between the opponent's legs to pull the opponent over the attacking wrestler so that they fall flat on their back. At this point, the attacking wrestler would stack the fallen opponent on their shoulders for the pin. Often when female wrestlers use this move, commentators will refer to it as a '''schoolgirl'''. An inverted version like the regular version instead lays sideways on the butt/thigh area in a form of a side bridge.

===Sitout pin===
The attacking wrestler sits down with the legs of the opponent hooked over their shoulders so that the legs and lower body of the opponent are elevated while their shoulders and upper back are in contact with the mat. The arms of the opponent are sometimes pinned beneath the legs of the attacker. This hold results from numerous [[Professional wrestling throws|throws]], including the [[Powerbomb#Sitout powerbomb|sitout powerbomb]], the [[Powerbomb#Spin-out powerbomb|spin-out powerbomb]], and the [[Professional wrestling holds#Sunset flip|sunset flip]]. Japanese wrestler, [[Manami Toyota]], popularized a modified pin that usually ended on a sitout position; She called it the ''Manami Roll''.

===Small package===
The small package—or '''[[Pin (amateur wrestling)#Cradle|inside cradle]]'''—is a pinning maneuver where the attacking wrestler puts the opponent into a front face lock and pulls the opponent’s near arm over their head, like a suplex. Then,  the attacking wrestler hooks their opponent’s far leg with he opposite leg and the opponent’s other leg with their hand. The attacker will then fall back, pinning the opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellison, Lillian|title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|year=2003|isbn=978-0-06-001258-8|publisher=ReaganBooks|page=128|quote=So what I'd do is pin the girl by folding her body into a small package. I'd pin her shoulders under her own body weight, with her butt high in the air and her boots touching the canvas right on either side of her own head.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=Jim|title=Q&amp;A|url=http://www.jrsbarbq.com/jrs-qa/wrestling/hey-jr-no-disrespect-its-small-package-not-inside-cradle-inside-cradle-when-you-hoo|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Split leg===
In this pinning maneuver where the attacking wrestler has the opponent on his back and the attacking wrestler grabs both legs, puts them above the opponent’s head, jumps up in the air, opens his legs, and falls on the opponent’s legs trapping him into a pinning situation.

===Straddle===
In this pinning technique, the attacking wrestler stands with their feet on either side of an opponent who is lying face-up on the mat. Then the attacker kneels across the opponent's chest facing their head, with each knee beside the chest. Sometimes the attacker sits on the opponent's chest for greater pressure. There is also a reverse variation in which the attacker is facing the opponent's feet. 

The shoulder straddle pin is typical variation of the straddle pin. It sees the attacker kneeling on the opponent's shoulders facing the head, pinning them on the mat. In another variation, the attacker sits on the neck or face of the opponent with or without the knee on the shoulder. Primarily called a facesit, it is used mostly by heels or in mixed professional wrestling to demonstrate dominance and entertain the crowd.

===Sunset flip===
This pin commonly sees an attacking wrestler dive over an opponent who is facing him/her, usually bent over forwards, catching the opponent in a waistlock from behind and landing back-first behind the opponent. From that position the wrestler rolls forward into a sitting position, pulling the opponent over backwards and down to the mat so that he lands on his back into a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Sitout pin|sitout pin]] position. While being held on the shoulders of an attacking wrestler in a position where this second wrestler is straddling the head of the attacking wrestler while facing in the other direction.
One variation is the split-legged (used by some known wrestlers like [[Alicia Fox]] and the retired [[Christy Hemme]]), in which a cornered wrestler as a counter to an oncoming opponent, jumps and splits his legs, sits in the top turnbuckle on a straddle position, then rolls forward to catch the opponent on a waist-lock to roll into a usual sunset flip.

===Victory roll===
The attacking wrestler jumps onto their opponent's shoulders from behind and rolls forward. As the attacker flips over, they hook the opponent's shoulders with their legs, flipping the opponent over onto their shoulders. The attacker hooks both of the opponent's legs to hold them in place for the pin.

===Wheelbarrow victory roll===
A slight variation of the victory roll, which sees the wrestler being [[Professional wrestling holds#Wheelbarrow|wheelbarrowed]] by the opponent. The wrestler then "counters" the wheelbarrow by the opponent, flipping forward into a pin, with both of the opponent's legs hooked to complete the pin. The slight difference between the two variations is that the wrestler in the normal victory roll is over the opponent's shoulders, while in the wheelbarrow variation the wrestler is scissoring the opponent's body under the shoulders.

A '''sublanguage''' is a [[subset]] of a [[language]]. Sublanguages occur in [[natural language]], [[programming language|computer language]], and [[relational database]]s.

==In natural language==

In [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]], [[natural language processing]], and [[machine translation]], a sublanguage is the language of a restricted domain, particularly a technical domain. In mathematical terms, "a subset of the sentences of a language forms a sublanguage of that language if it is closed under some operations of the language: e.g., if when two members of a subset are operated on, as by ''and'' or ''because'', the resultant is also a member of that subset" (Z. S. Harris ''Language and Information'', Columbia U. Press, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;34).

==In computer languages==
The term sublanguage has also sometimes been used to denote a computer language that is a subset of another language. A sublanguage may be restricted syntactically (it accepts a [[subgrammar]] of the original language), and/or semantically (the set of possible outcomes for any given program is a subset of the possible outcomes in the original language).

===Examples===
For instance, [[ALGOL 68S]] was a subset of [[ALGOL 68]] designed to make it possible to write a single-pass [[compiler]] for this ''sublanguage''.

[[SQL]] (Structured Query Language) statements are classified in various ways,&lt;ref&gt;[[SQL-92]], 4.22 SQL-statements, 4.22.1  Classes of SQL-statements "There are at least five ways of classifying SQL-statements:", 4.22.2, SQL statements classified by function "The following are the main classes of SQL-statements:"; [[SQL:2003]] 4.11 SQL-statements, and later revisions.&lt;/ref&gt; which can be grouped into sublanguages, commonly: a [[data query language]] (DQL), a [[data definition language]] (DDL), a [[data control language]] (DCL), and a [[data manipulation language]] (DML).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Structured Query Language By Example - Volume I: Data Query Language

|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=64MBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 8]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relational database theory==

In [[relational database]] theory, the term "sublanguage", first used for this purpose by [[Edgar F. Codd|E. F. Codd]] in 1970, refers to a [[computer language]] used to define or manipulate the structure and contents of a [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS). Typical sublanguages associated with modern RDBMS's are [[Query by Example|QBE]] (Query by Example) and [[SQL]] (Structured Query Language). In 1985, Codd encapsulated his thinking in twelve rules which every database must satisfy in order to be truly relational. The fifth rule is known as the ''Comprehensive data sublanguage rule'', and states:

: ''A relational system may support several languages and various modes of terminal use (for example, the fill-in-the-blanks mode). However, there must be at least one language whose statements are expressible, per some well-defined syntax, as character strings, and that is comprehensive in supporting all of the following items:''
:* ''Data definition''
:* ''View definition''
:* ''Data manipulation (interactive and by program)''
:* ''Integrity constraints''
:* ''Authorization''
:* ''Transaction boundaries (begin, commit, and rollback)''

[[File:Midtbo3.JPG|thumb|250 px|Midtbø in Vinje, site of the home of novelist Tarjei Vesaas and poet Halldis Moren Vesaas]]

'''Tarjei Vesaas''' (20 August 1897 – 15 March 1970) was a Norwegian poet and novelist. Vesaas is widely considered to be one of Norway's greatest writers of the twentieth century and perhaps its most important since [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=9629|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Vesaas was born in [[Vinje]], [[Telemark]], Norway.  He was the oldest of three sons.  He was guilt-ridden by his refusal to take over the family farm, and this guilt permeates much of his authorship. He spent much of his youth in solitude, seeking comfort and solace in nature. The destruction he witnessed after [[World War I]] also made a deep impression on him. He married the writer [[Halldis Moren Vesaas]] and moved to Midtbø in his home district of Vinje in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Tarjei_Vesaas|title=Tarjei Vesaas|publisher=Store norske leksikon|author=Erik Bjerck Hagen|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aschehoug.no/Forfattere/Vaare-forfattere/Halldis-Moren_Vesaas|title=Halldis Moren Vesaas|publisher=Aschehoug|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His authorship covers almost 50 years, from 1923 to 1970. Written in [[Nynorsk]], his work is characterized by simple, terse, and symbolic prose. His stories are often about simple rural people that undergo a severe psychological drama and who according to critics are described with immense psychological insight. Commonly dealing with themes such as [[death]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[angst]], and other deep and intractable human emotions, the Norwegian natural landscape is a prevalent feature in his works. His debut was in 1923 with ''Children of Humans'' (''Menneskebonn''), but he had his breakthrough in 1934 with ''The Great Cycle'' (''Det store spelet''). His mastery of the [[nynorsk]] language, ''[[landsmål]]'' (see [[Norwegian language]]), has contributed to its acceptance as a medium of world class literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nbl.snl.no/Tarjei_Vesaas|title=Tarjei Vesaas|publisher=Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Steinar Gimnes|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prolific author, he won a number of awards, including the [[Gyldendal's Endowment]] in 1943 and [[Dobloug Prize]] in 1957. He was awarded the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] in 1963 for his novel ''The Ice Palace'' and the Venice Prize in 1953 for ''The Winds''. He was mentioned as being considered for the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] on three separate occasions (1964, 1968 and 1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=17842|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous of his works are ''[[The Ice Palace (novel)|The Ice Palace]] (Is-slottet)'', a story of two girls who build a profoundly strong relationship, and ''[[The Birds (novel)|The Birds]] (Fuglane)'', a story of an adult of a simple childish mind, which through his tenderhearted empathy and imagination bears the role of a seer or writer. His novels have been translated into 28 languages. Several of his books have been translated into English – many of them published by [[Peter Owen Publishers]]– among them ''[[Spring Night]]'', ''The Birds,'' ''Through Naked Branches,'' and ''The Ice Palace''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.gyldendal.no/Gyldendal/Authors/Vesaas-Tarjei|title=tarjei Vesaas (1897-1970)|publisher=Gyldendal Norsk Forlag AS|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vale languages''', or '''Ruto–Vale''', comprise a small number of languages spoken by a few tens of thousands of people in the [[Central African Republic]] and perhaps [[Chad]]. They are members of the [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic]] language family. 

The most populous Vale language is [[Ruto language|Ruto]] (Lutos), spoken by twenty thousand people. The other clearly related language is [[Vale language|Vale]] (with its Tana variety perhaps a third).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1278">'''Vocal weight''' refers to the perceived "lightness" or "heaviness" of a singing voice.  This quality of the voice is one of the major determining factors in [[voice classification]] within classical music. Lighter voices are often associated with the term "lyric" and are usually brighter and more agile; heavier voices are often associated with the term "dramatic" and are usually powerful, rich, and darker. Other voice types like the [[spinto]] have a more medium vocal weight. Vocal weight can also affect overall vocal agility; heavier voices often have more difficulty maneuvering through florid [[coloratura]] passages than their lighter counterparts, as their weight and power compromises agility. Likewise, dramatic roles are often written with larger orchestras in mind as dramatic voices can carry more easily over larger ensembles.&lt;ref name=McKinney&gt;{{cite book
