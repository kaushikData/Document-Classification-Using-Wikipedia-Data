[[Image:Peru 2005 Censo.png|left|100px|Logo of the Peru 2005 census performed by [[INEI]].]]
The '''2005 Peru Census''' was a detailed enumeration of the [[Peru]]vian population. It was conducted by the [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática]] from July 18 through August 20, 2005. Its full name in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is ''X Censo de Población y V de Vivienda'' ("Tenth Population and Fifth Household Census"). The previous census performed in Peru was the [[Peru 1993 Census|1993 Census]]. The following census was the [[Peru 2007 Census|2007 Census]].

The results of the census were released to the public on November 30, 2005 after all the census materials from the country's 25 [[Political division of Peru|regions]] were transported to [[Arequipa]] and processed at the INEI information processing center in that city.

==Results==
The total population of Peru is '''26,152,265''' inhabitants. The following table shows a breakdown of the total population per region and the Lima Province.

'''American Chileans''' and '''Canadian Chileans''' are among roughly 300,000 Chileans of North American ancestry (includes [[Americans]] and [[Canadians]]). 19th century settlement and [[land speculation]] deals brought tens of thousands of Americans to Chile with the rest of Central and [[South America]].

== History ==

=== Immigration ===
Along with the [[British people|British]], [[Americans]] came to Chile to develop the country's economy and trade from the early 19th century onwards. Even though very few compared to the [[British Chilean|British]], they did contribute to Chile's wealth and economic development well into the 20th century. Other [[English speaking]] immigrants included [[Irish people|Irish]], [[New Zealand]]ers and [[Australia]]ns.

[[Valparaíso]] was on the route from Britain to California, which the United States won from Mexico in 1845. That same port was even the scene of one of the battles of the [[Anglo-American War]] of 1812. One American who was in Chile was Wheelwright, who introduced the railway in Chile and nearby [[Argentina]] in the 1850s. In the [[California Gold Rush]], a massive influx of Chilean miners went to California and many had returned to Chile wealthier than before.

To Chileans, Americans, almost all of [[British American|British]] ancestry at the time, were so similar to the British that they were both lumped together as ''[[gringo]]s'', a term still used for Americans. Nowadays, most Chileans are much familiar with American culture than British culture, due to Hollywood and popular music.

An alleged [[Cherokee]] immigration from the [[United States]] took place in the late 1800s, but the estimated 100-150,000 Chileans of Cherokee descent isn't officially confirmed. It was thought [[Joaquin Murieta]] of 1850's [[California]] folklore was of Cherokee-Chilean descent, but more likely, official sources found he's from [[Sonora, Mexico]] thus a Mexican came to the state after US annexation in the [[Mexican-American War]]. The Cherokee, like the large [[German Chilean]] community, [[Palestinian Chilean]]s (see [[Arab Chilean]]s) and [[Korean Chilean]]s (see [[Asian Chileans]]), are thought to contributed to Chilean prosperity. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

From the United States of America (esp. the state of [[Utah]]), [[Mormons]] from the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] introduced Mormonism into Chile and today, 700,000 (565,000 regular or active) members out of Chile's 18.5 million people are Mormon - 4 percent of the population, and there's a [[Santiago Chile Temple|temple in Chile]] while a second one was announced for [[Concepción, Chile|Concepcion]]. ''See [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Chile]]''.

=== Contributions ===
''Americo-Chilean''s played a role in international diplomacy between the two countries (see [[United States-Chile relations]]). The relationship turned tense during the [[Salvador Allende]] era (1970–73), in which the American [[CIA]]-backed bloody [[Chilean coup of 1973|coup]] replaced him with general [[Augusto Pinochet]] to head a right-wing military regime (1973–89).

Also the American Chilean community were instrumental in reformation of the [[economy of Chile]] since the [[Chicago Boys]] experiment in American business schools from the late 1950s to early 1990s known as ''El Milagro Economico'' (the economic miracle) or [[Miracle of Chile]].

Historically, some Chilean immigrants to the United States (see [[Chilean American]]) originated from the [[Central Valley of Chile]] from the [[San Antonio, Chile]] and [[Los Angeles, Chile]] areas, usually to [[California]] during the gold rush era (1846–54). Many Chileans prospered there and some were established enough to return home with their new wealth.

On August 16, 1906 [[1906 Valparaíso earthquake|a major earthquake]] struck Valparaíso with great devastation and thousands of deaths. Chilean doctor Carlos Van Buren, of American descent, was involved in medical care of earthquake victims. He later established a modern hospital [[Carlos Van Buren Hospital]] in 1912. American and European medical staffers improved medical care in Chile, where it has a universal health system since 1925.

Military experts from the United States and [[Great Britain]] when the [[British Empire]] peaked in the turn of the 20th century, and pre-1914 [[Prussia]] (now [[Germany]]) developed and modernized the Chilean armed forces (the army, national police, navy and air force).

== Demography ==
Today, American culture is a dominant force in Chilean society, and an increase of North American tourists from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in the 1990s and 2000s attracted to the world-renowned scenery and increasing economic opportunity in Chile.

==Education==
[[International School Nido de Aguilas]], an American school, is in Santiago.

'''Antwerp Mannerism''' is the name given to the style of a group of largely anonymous painters active in the Southern Netherlands and principally in Antwerp in the beginning of the 16th century.  The style bore no relation to Renaissance or Italian [[Mannerism]], but the name suggests a peculiarity that was a reaction to the "classic" style of the [[Early Netherlandish painting|earlier Flemish painters]].&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Antwerpener Meister 002.jpg|thumb|290px|''Adoration of the Magi'' by Anonymous Antwerp Mannerist]]

The term Antwerp Manierists' was first used in 1915 by [[Max Jakob Friedländer]] in his work ''Die Antwerpener Manieristen von 1520'', in which he made a first attempt to put order in the growing number of works from the Netherlands that were catalogued under the 'name of embarrassment 'pseudo-Herri met de Bles'.&lt;ref name=max&gt;Max J. Friedländer: Die Antwerpener Manieristen von 1520. In: Jahrbuch der königlich preußischen Kunstsammlungen 36, 1915, p. 65–91, p. 65 {{link language|de|German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedländer used the term Antwerp Mannerism here as synonymous for "Antwerp style".&lt;ref&gt;Kolder Weij, Hermesdorf, Huvenne:.. The painting of the Low Countries, Part 1. Amsterdam University Press, 2006, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Even though he added the location 'Antwerp' to name the artists and placed them in the year 1520,  Friedländer made it clear that he did not intend to limit the group strictly to Antwerp and the time period to circae 1520, even though he was of the opinion that most of the "pseudo-Bles' works originated from Antwerp and Antwerp workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Max J. Friedländer, 1915, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Friedländer placed the works attributed to the group in a time period between 1500 and 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Max J. Friedländer, 1915, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name Antwerp Mannerism the style was not limited to Antwerp. The style also appeared in the north of France and the Northern Netherlands.&lt;ref name=cod&gt;[http://www.codart.nl/exhibitions/details/957/ Codart:ExtravagANT! Antwerpse schilderijen voor de Europese markt 1500-1525] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Artists==
Although attempts have been made to identify the individual artists that were part of this movement, most of the paintings remain attributed to [[anonymous masters]] as the paintings were not signed.  This anonymity has contributed to a lack of knowledge about or popularity of their works.  Only a minority of the works have been classified. The makers of the altarpieces have been given [[notname]]s based on any external knowledge about the works such as an inscription, a previous owner, the place where it was kept or a date found on the work.  Th of Pseudo-Bles, the Master of the Von Groote Adoration, the Master of Amiens, the Antwerp Master of the Adoration and the Master of 1518.  Works that cannot be attributed directly to a named master are attributed to the ''Anonymous Antwerp Mannerist''.
[[File:Meister von Hoogstraeten 003.jpg|thumb|300px|''Virgin and Child'' by the [[Master of Hoogstraeten]]]]
It has been possible to identify some of the artists.&lt;ref name=cod/&gt;  [[Jan de Beer (painter)|Jan de Beer]], the [[Master of 1518]] (possibly [[Jan Mertens the Younger|Jan Mertens]] or [[Jan van Dornicke]]) are some of the identified artists who are regarded as Antwerp Mannerists. The early paintings of [[Jan Gossaert]] and [[Adriaen Isenbrandt]] also show characteristics of the style.  The paintings combine [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] and [[Northern Renaissance]] styles, and incorporate both Flemish and Italian traditions into the same compositions.&lt;ref&gt;

The Antwerp Mannerists typically depicted religious themes, which they interpreted generally in a more superficial manner than the Flemish artists of the previous century in favour of a more fluid form and an abundance of meticulously rendered details.&lt;ref name=bex&gt;[http://www.openbaarkunstbezit.be/sites/default/files/tijdschrift/pdf/OKV1965/Meester%20van%20de%20Antwerpse%20Aanbidding%20-%20De%20Aanbidding.pdf "H. Bex-Verschaeren" "Meester van de Antwerpse aanbidding]", in: Openbaar Kunstbezit, 1965 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also show a preference for a changing palette.  Their compositions are typically shock-full with agitated figures in exotic, extravagant clothes.  The compositions typically include architectural ruins.  The architecture is initially Gothic but later Renaissance motifs become dominant.&lt;ref name=am&gt;'De schilderkunst der Lage Landen: De Middeleeuwen en de zestiende eeuw', Amsterdam University Press, 2006, p. 172-175 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the panels or triptychs produced by the Antwerp Mannerists depicted scenes of the [[Nativity of Jesus]], usually situated at night, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] and the Crucifixion.&lt;ref name=bex/&gt;  

The theme of the Adoration of the Magi was in particular dear to them as it allowed the artists to give free rein to their preoccupation with ornament and the simulation and imitation of luxury products.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. H. Cleland, ''Grand Design: Pieter Coecke van Aelst and Renaissance Tapestry'', Metropolitan Museum of Art, 6 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
The next wave of influence from Italian painting came with [[Romanism (painting)|Romanism]], as seen in the later works of Gossaert.

'''Afghanistan's Children - A New Approach (ASCHIANA)''' ({{lang-fa|اشیانه}} ''Ašiyānā'', meaning "the nest") is an Afghan [[nongovernmental organisation]] that has provided services, support and programs to working [[street children]] and their families since 1995. ASCHIANA currently serves 4,500 students in [[Afghanistan]] through centers in [[Kabul]], [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], [[Herat]] and [[Parwan]]. ASCHIANA operates four centres in Kabul: two centres for basic education, one centre for accelerated girls' education and one emergency shelter for runaway children (with day care and basic education). ASCHIANA also provides basic education for internally displaced persons and returned refugees through five outreach areas in Kabul.

ASCHIANA works together with Afghanistan’s Ministry of Education, Ministry of Social Affairs and the [[Afghan National Police]] to help children on the street receive a basic education—in [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], English, mathematics, [[Islamic studies|Islamic Education]], [[health education]], mine awareness, drug awareness and [[children's rights]]—and integrate into the formal school system.

ASCHIANA students also enjoy recreational activities through sports, music and art, and receive training in skills such as carpentry, woodworking, cosmetology, tailoring, painting, instrument making, electrical engineering and plumbing. ASCHIANA also provides health, financial and social support for students and their families.

ASCHIANA’s students work on the streets to provide an income for their families. Many of them have lost one or both parents and have become their household’s main source of income. ASCHIANA’s goals are to support these children and their families:

* by providing a basic education, school supplies and a warm meal;
* by offering children a safe environment to learn and develop;
* by promoting safe, well-informed livelihoods;
* by building children’s capacities through social and vocational skills training, and;
* by giving street-working children an opportunity to pursue further education.

ASCHIANA's work has been highlighted in research by [[Terre des hommes|Terre des Hommes]] and the [[Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit (AREU)]] and has received support for its operations from  [[Roshan (telco)|Roshan]] and [[Siemens]] (among other sources). ASCHIANA is dedicated to continuing support for the social wellness and educational growth of Afghanistan’s working [[street children]] and their families.{{cn|date=January 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10687">'''''Average is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation''''' is a 2013 book (release date: September 12, 2013) by economist [[Tyler Cowen]] laying out his vision for the future trajectory of the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Average is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation|year=2013|publisher=Dutton Adult|
isbn=978-0-525-95373-9|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sequel to Cowen's 2011 book ''[[The Great Stagnation]]'' that argued that [[United States|America]] had exhausted many of the [[low-hanging fruit]] (such as cheap land and easily achievable improvements in education) that had powered its growth in the 19th century and early 20th century.

==Themes==

Cowen forecasts that modern economies are delaminating into two groups: a small minority of highly educated and capable of working collaboratively with automated systems will become a wealthy aristocracy; the vast majority will earn little or nothing, surviving on low-priced goods created by the first group, living in [[shantytown]]s working with highly automated production systems.&lt;ref name=wsj0913/&gt;

Cowen claims that this future is foreshadowed by the recent evolution of chess from a game played by brilliant iconoclasts into [[freestyle chess]], a team sport that relies on the creative use of advanced chess-playing software.&lt;ref name=wsj0913/&gt;

Cowen celebrates the arrival of functional [[online education]], mostly because it allows a much broader audience to keep up with rapid change at a price that everyone can afford and leverages the same sort of self-teaching that drives [[video game]] players to ever-greater achievements.&lt;ref name=wsj0913/&gt;

He sees the future role of educators as motivators rather than professors, closer to a gym membership, with (online) [[personal trainer]]s. He cites [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], as a place full of young threshold earners, members of the second group.&lt;ref name=wsj0913/&gt;

In his final chapter, "A New Social Contract?," Cowen writes, "We will move from a society based on the pretense that everyone is given an okay standard of living to a society in which people are expected to fend for themselves much more than they do now."&lt;ref name=wsj0913/&gt;

==Reception==

===Interviews and discussions===

Technology writer and critic [[Andrew Keen]] interviewed Cowen for his ''Keen On'' series for ''[[TechCrunch]]'' in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/03/keen-on-smart-machines-the-next-big-thing-for-smart-human-beings/|title = Keen On&amp;nbsp;... Smart Machines: The Next Big Thing For Smart Human Beings|last = Keen|first = Andrew|date = 2013-09-03|accessdate = 2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowen appeared on a ''[[Financial Times]]'' [[podcast]]. [[Diane Coyle]] also participated to discuss her own book and the authors talked about each other's books as well. The host was Cardiff Garcia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://podcast.ft.com/index.php?pid=1955|title = FT AlphaChat|publisher = ''[[Financial Times]]''|date = 2013-09-11|accessdate = 2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowen appeared on [[National Public Radio]] in September 2013 to discuss the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/09/12/221425582/tired-of-inequality-one-economist-says-itll-only-get-worse|title = Tired Of Inequality? One Economist Says It'll Only Get Worse|publisher = [[National Public Radio]]|date = 2013-09-12|accessdate = 2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowen discussed the themes of the book in a video interview by Nia-Malika Henderson for the ''On Background'' series of the ''[[Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mercatus.org/video/tyler-cowen-discusses-average-over-washington-posts-background|title = Tyler Cowen Discusses "Average Is Over" on The Washington Post's "On Background"|last = Cowen|first = Tyler|publisher = [[Mercatus Center]]|date = 2013-09-16|accessdate = 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

99u published some advice from Cowen for its readers that was based on the insights in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://99u.com/articles/20696/you-dont-need-to-learn-to-code-other-truths-about-the-future-of-careers|title = You Don't Need To Learn To Code + Other Truths About the Future of Careers|last = Blanda|first = Sean|publisher = ''99u''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===

The book was reviewed favorably by Philip Delves Broughton in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=wsj0913&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303342104579097482945031804|title = Book Review: 'Average Is Over,' by Tyler Cowen: The better we become at working alongside machines, the more the new economy will reward us. Fail and we'll be outsourced.|last = Broughton|first = Philip Delves|date = 2013-10-02|accessdate = 2013-10-05|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broughton noted that Cowen had not investigated high finance in his book and could have done so, but was otherwise favorably impressed by Cowen's themes.

[[Matthew Yglesias]] gave the book a mixed but largely positive review on his ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' blog, ''Moneybox''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/09/26/average_is_over_the_new_book_from_tyler_cowen.html|title = Average Is Over – If We Want It to Be|last = Yglesias|first = Matthew|date = 2013-09-26|accessdate = 2013-10-05|publisher = ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Moneybox blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, he writes, he expects that the book "will set the intellectual agenda in much the way that its predecessor [''The Great Stagnatio''n] did not," but on the other says that its "somewhat cryptic tone" requires "explication." He writes that ''Average Is Over'' apparently contradicts Cowen's previous book, [[The Great Stagnation]] – whereas that book argued (to quote Yglesias) "that the median household in rich countries had suffered stagnant living standards thanks to a slowdown in technological progress," ''Average Is Over'' argues that "the median household in rich countries will suffer stagnant living standards thanks to a speedup in technological progress." Yglesias proposes that the contradiction is resolved because "read in conjunction it's clear that in neither period was the stagnation actually caused by the pace of technological change&amp;nbsp;... scratch the surface and you'll see that Cowen actually thinks there's a policy reform agenda that, if implemented in a timely fashion, would channel much more of the gains of future automation and computerization to the median household." Yglesias then says that the policy reforms favored by Cowen constitute "in general a very solid forward-thinking 21st century egalitarian agenda." But he explains why Cowen "doubts the political system will deliver any of these solutions," and also notes that Cowen argues that "these somewhat bleak trends he forecasts aren't really all that bad if you look at them in the right light." He concludes by explaining why he disagrees with Cowen on both of these points.

Robert Heritt reviewed the book for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', calling it a "lively and worryingly prophetic read."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/17/welcome-to-tyler-cowen-s-future-of-genius-machines.html|title = Welcome to Tyler Cowen's Future of Genius Machines|last = Heritt|first = Robert|date = 2013-09-17|accessdate = 2013-10-12|publisher = ''[[The Daily Beast]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book also received a (gated) review from Brenda Jubin on [[Seeking Alpha]]. Jubin wrote: "The future Cowen paints is pretty bleak for the majority of Americans." She concluded by writing: "This is not a future I want to see. We can only hope that, as often happens, trends are disrupted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/1689592-book-review-cowen-average-is-over|title = Book Review: Cowen, Average Is Over|last = Jubin|first = Brenda|publisher = [[Seeking Alpha]]|date = 2013-09-12|accessdate = 2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Economist]] gave the book a mixed review, observing that Cowen's predictions about the use of technology for surveillance, rising unemployment and demands for lower taxes were in line with current trends, but arguing that Cowen was too sanguine about the potential for inter-generational conflict or the appeal of demagogues in a democracy where the majority will become poorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The American Dream, RIP? |url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21586581-economist-asks-provocative-questions-about-future-social-mobility-american |newspaper=The Economist |location=London |publisher=The Economist Group |date=21 September 2013 |accessdate=9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviewers of the book included Teresa Hartnett for [[Publishers Weekly]] (a negative review),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-95373-9|title = Average Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation |last = Hartnett|first = Teresa|date = 2013-07-08|accessdate = 2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] for the ''[[Washington Examiner]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/tyler-cowens-future-shock-no-more-average-people/article/2536849|title = Tyler Cowen's future shock: No more average people|date = 2013-10-04|accessdate = 2013-10-12|last = Barone|first = Michael|publisher = ''[[Washington Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/360850/new-world-work|title =  A New World of Work|last = Strain|first = Michael R.|date = 2013-10-28|accessdate = 2013-10-12|publisher = ''[[National Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Belarus gained independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, the language was only known in English as ''Byelorussian'' or ''Belorussian'', transliterating the [[Russian language|Russian]] name, {{lang|ru|белорусский язык}} ''Belorusskiy yazyk'', or alternatively as ''White Ruthenian'' ({{IPAc-en|r|uː|ˈ|θ|iː|n|i|ə|n}}) or ''White Russian''. Following independence, it has acquired the additional name ''Belarusian''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/translation/Belarusan/ Belarusan English Dictionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205223914/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/translation/Belarusan/ |date=December 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Belarusan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bel |title=Belarusan |website=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belarusian is one of the [[East Slavic languages]] and shares many grammatical and lexical features with other members of the group. To some extent, [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and Belarusian are [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. Its predecessor stage is known as [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (14th to 17th centuries), in turn descended from [[Old East Slavic]] (10th to 13th centuries).

In the first [[Belarus Census (1999)|Belarus Census]] of 1999, the Belarusian language was declared as a "language spoken at home" by about 3,686,000 Belarusian citizens (36.7% of the population).&lt;ref name=census&gt;Data from 1999 Belarusian general census [http://belstat.gov.by/homep/en/census/main.php in English] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505120940/http://belstat.gov.by/homep/en/census/main.php |date=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Of these, about 3,370,000 (41.3%){{Clarify|date=April 2013}} were [[Belarusians]], and about 257,000 belonged to other ethnicities ([[Russians]], [[Poles]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Jews]]).&lt;/ref&gt; About 6,984,000 (85.6%) of [[Belarusians]] declared it their "mother tongue". Other sources, such as Ethnologue, put the figure at approximately 2.5 million active speakers.&lt;ref name="Belarusan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Russia]], the Belarusian language is declared as a "familiar language" by about 316,000 inhabitants, among them about 248,000 Belarusians, comprising about 30.7% of Belarusians living in Russia (data from [[Russian Census (2002)]] [http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/ In Russian]{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}). In [[Ukraine]], the Belarusian language is declared as a "native language" by about 55,000 Belarusians, which comprise about 19.7% of Belarusians living in Ukraine (data from 2001 Ukrainian census [http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/ In Ukrainian]). In [[Poland]], the Belarusian language is declared as a "language spoken at home" by about 40,000 inhabitants (data from 2002 Polish general census [http://www.stat.gov.pl/dane_spol-gosp/nsp/ludnosc/index.htm Table 34 (in Polish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525185706/http://www.stat.gov.pl/dane_spol-gosp/nsp/ludnosc/index.htm |date=May 25, 2005 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study done by the Belarusian government in 2009, 72% of Belarusians speak Russian at home, while Belarusian is actively used by only 11.9% of Belarusians. Approximately 29.4% of Belarusians can write, speak, and read Belarusian, while 52.5% can only read and speak it.

== Phonology ==
{{Belarusians}}
{{main|Belarusian phonology}}
Although closely related to other [[East Slavic languages]], especially [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], Belarusian [[phonology]] is distinct in a number of ways. The [[phoneme]] inventory of the modern Belarusian language consists of 45 to 54 phonemes: 6 vowels and 39 to 48 [[consonants]], depending on how they are counted.  When the nine [[gemination|geminate]] consonants are excluded as mere variations, there are 39 consonants, and excluding rare consonants further decreases the count.  The number 48 includes ''all'' consonant sounds, including variations and rare sounds, which may be semantically distinct in the modern Belarusian language.

== Alphabet ==
{{main |Belarusian alphabet}}
The Belarusian alphabet is a variant of the [[Cyrillic script]], which was first used as an alphabet for the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language. The modern Belarusian form was defined in 1918, and consists of thirty-two letters. Before that, Belarusian had also been written in the [[Belarusian Latin alphabet]] (Łacinka / Лацінка), the [[Belarusian Arabic alphabet]] (by [[Lipka Tatars]]) and the [[Hebrew alphabet]] (by [[Belarusian Jews]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://omniglot.com/writing/belarusian.htm |title=Belarusian language, alphabet and pronunciation |website=Omniglot.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] script had been used, sporadically, until the 11th or 12th century.

There are several systems of [[Romanization|romanizing]] (transliterating) written Belarusian text in existence; see [[Romanization of Belarusian]].

== Grammar ==
{{main |Belarusian grammar}}
Standardized [[Belarusian grammar]] in its modern form was adopted in 1959, with minor amendments in 1985. It was developed from the initial form set down by [[Branislaw Tarashkyevich]] (first printed in [[Vilnius]], 1918). Historically, there had existed several other alternative standardized forms of Belarusian grammar.  It is mainly based on the Belarusian folk dialects of [[Minsk]]-[[Vilnius]] region.

Belarusian grammar is mostly synthetic and partly analytic, and overall is quite similar to [[Russian grammar]]. Belarusian orthography, however, differs significantly from [[Russian orthography]] in some respects, due to the fact that it is a [[phonetic orthography]] that closely represents the surface phonology, whereas Russian orthography represents the underlying [[morphophonology]].

The most significant instance of this is in the representation of vowel reduction, and in particular ''[[akanye|akannye]]'', the merger of unstressed /a/ and /o/, which exists in both Russian and Belarusian.  Belarusian always spells this merged sound as {{angbr|a}}, whereas Russian uses either {{angbr|a}} or {{angbr|o}}, according to what the "underlying" phoneme is (determined by looking at related words where the vowel is stressed, or if no such words exist, either by etymology or by the pronunciation in dialects that lack the merger).  This means that Belarusian noun and verb paradigms, as written, have large numbers of instances of alternations between written {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|o}}, whereas no such alternations exist in the corresponding written paradigms in Russian.  This can significantly complicate the task of foreign speakers in learning these paradigms; but, on the other hand, it makes spelling easier for native speakers.
&lt;!-- An example is the word for "water", вада́ {{angbr|vadá}}, which has prepositional plural во́дах {{angbr|vódax}}, with a change from {{angbr|a}} to {{angbr|o}} when it takes the stress, whereas the word "country", стрaнá {{angbr|straná}}, which is in the same declension, has prepositional plural стрáнaх {{angbr|stránax}}, without such change.  The corresponding Russian words are вода́ {{angbr|vodá}} and стрaнá {{angbr|straná}}, where the underlying phoneme is always notated and no written {{angbr|a}}~{{angbr|o}} alternations exist. --&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted this example because literary Belarusian has no word страна́; it can be used only in a colloquial form of Belarusian called  Trasianka, but it is  usually never written, and if it is written, it has no standard form — no orthography for it exists. The correct Belarusian word for "coutry" is краіна, but it has a different stress so it cannot be used as an example in this case. --&gt;

]]

Besides the literary norm, there exist two main [[dialect]]s of the Belarusian language, the North-Eastern and the South-Western. In addition, there exist the transitional Middle Belarusian dialect group and the separate West Palyesian dialect group.

The North-Eastern and the South-Western dialects are separated by a hypothetical line [[Ashmyany]]–[[Minsk]]–[[Babruysk]]–[[Homyel]], with the area of the Middle Belarusian dialect group placed on and along this line.

The North-Eastern dialect is chiefly characterized by the "soft sounding R" ({{lang|be|мякка-эравы}}) and "strong [[akanye]]" ({{lang|be|моцнае аканне}}), and the South-Western dialect is chiefly characterized by the "hard sounding R" ({{lang|be|цвёрда-эравы}}) and "moderate akanye" ({{lang|be|умеранае аканне}}).

The [[West Polesian dialect|West Polesian dialect group]] is more distinct linguistically, close to [[Ukrainian language]] in many aspects and is separated by the conventional line [[Pruzhany]]–[[Ivatsevichy]]–[[Telekhany]]–[[Luninyets]]–[[Stolin]].

==Classification and relationship to other languages==

There is a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] among Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian languages.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander M. Schenker. 1993. "Proto-Slavonic," ''The Slavonic Languages''. (Routledge). Pp. 60-121. Pg. 60: "[The] distinction between dialect and language being blurred, there can be no unanimity on this issue in all instances..."&lt;br/&gt;C.F. Voegelin and F.M. Voegelin. 1977. ''Classification and Index of the World's Languages'' (Elsevier). Pg. 311, "In terms of immediate mutual intelligibility, the East Slavic zone is a single language." As members of the East Slavic group of languages, they are descended from a common ancestor.&lt;/ref&gt; Belarusian has 80% mutual intelligibility with Ukrainian, 75% with Russian, and 55% with the [[Polish language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4080349/Mutual_Intelligibility_of_Languages_in_the_Slavic_Family |author=Robert Lindsay |title=Mutual Intelligibility of Languages in the Slavic Family |website=www.academia.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within East Slavic, the Belarusian language is most closely related to Ukrainian.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Sussex, Paul V. Cubberley. (2006). ''The Slavic languages .'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pg. 518&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==History==

[[File:Lithuanian Statute I.jpg|thumb|The first [[Statutes of Lithuania|Lithuanian statute]] of 1529, in Belarusian]]

The modern Belarusian language was redeveloped on the base of the vernacular spoken remnants of the [[Old Belarusian language]], surviving in the ethnic Belarusian territories in the 19th century. The end of the 18th century (the times of the [[Partitions of Poland|Divisions of Commonwealth]]) is the usual conventional borderline between the [[Old Belarusian language|Old Belarusian]] and Modern Belarusian stages of development.

By the end of the 18th century, (Old) Belarusian was still common among the minor nobility in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Grand Duchy of Lithuania (GDL)]]. [[Jan Czeczot]] in the 1840s had mentioned that even his generation's grandfathers preferred speaking (Old) Belarusian.&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926] Ch. XVII Sec.1&lt;/ref&gt; (According to A. N. Pypin, the Belarusian language was spoken in some areas among the minor nobility during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[Turuk 1921], p.10&lt;/ref&gt;) In its vernacular form, it was the language of the smaller town dwellers and of the peasantry and it had been the language of oral folklore. Teaching in Belarusian was conducted mainly in schools run by the [[Order of Saint Basil the Great|Basilian order]].

The development of Belarusian in the 19th century was strongly influenced by the political conflict in the territories of the former GDL, between the Russian Imperial authorities, trying to consolidate their rule over the "joined provinces", and the Polish and Polonised nobility, trying to bring back its [[partitions of Poland|pre-Partitions]] rule&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926] Ch. XXII Sec.1 p.507&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[Polonization#Partitions|Polonization in times of Partitions]]).

[[File:Biblia Ruska.jpg|thumb|left|The Bible by [[Francysk Skaryna]] in Belarusian, 16th century]] One of the important manifestations of this conflict was the struggle for ideological control over the educational system. The Polish and Russian languages were being introduced and re-introduced, while the general state of the people's education remained poor until the very end of the Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926] Ch. XV Sect. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the first two decades of the 19th century had seen the unprecedented prosperity of Polish culture and language in the former GDL lands, and had prepared the era of such famous "Belarusians by birth – Poles by choice," as [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]] and [[Władysław Syrokomla|Syrokomla]]. The era had seen the effective completion of the Polonization of the lowest level of the nobility, the further reduction of the area of use of contemporary Belarusian,  and the effective folklorization of Belarusian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Per (Dovnar 1926), (Smalyanchuk 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Due both to the state of the people's education and to the strong positions of Polish and Polonized nobility, it was only after the 1880s–1890s that the educated Belarusian element, still shunned because of "peasant origin", began to appear in state offices.&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926] Ch. XV Sect. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--=== Grammar in 19th century ===--&gt;
&lt;!--There was a grammar of Belarusian language (using Cyrillic alphabet) prepared by bishop ... By the early 2000s the manuscript for it had not yet been found. (Smalyanchuk 2001)--&gt;
In 1846, ethnographer Pavel Shpilevskiy prepared a Belarusian grammar (using the Cyrillic alphabet) on the basis of the folk dialects of the [[Minsk]] region. However, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] refused to print his submission, on the basis that it had not been prepared in a sufficiently scientific manner.&lt;!-- other efforts, Tsyotka, chytanki --&gt;

From the mid-1830s ethnographic works began to appear, and tentative attempts to study the language were instigated (e.g., Shpilevskiy's grammar). The Belarusian literary tradition began to re-form, based on the folk language, initiated by the works of [[Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich]]. ''See also'': [[Jan Czeczot]], [[Jan Barszczewski]].&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926]. Ch. XV. Sect.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 1860s, both the Russian and Polish parties in Belarusian lands had begun to realise that the decisive role in the [[January Uprising|upcoming conflicts]] was shifting to the peasantry, overwhelmingly Belarusian. So a large amount of propaganda appeared, targeted at the peasantry and written in Belarusian;&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926] Ch. XV Sect. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; notably, the anti-Russian, anti-Tsarist, [[anti-Eastern Orthodox]] "Manifesto" and the newspaper "Peasants' Truth" (1862–1863) by [[Konstanty Kalinowski|Kalinowski]], and anti-Polish, anti-Revolutionary, pro-Orthodox booklets and poems (1862).&lt;ref&gt;[Turuk 1921], p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of the all-Russian "narodniki" and Belarusian national movements (late 1870s–early 1880s) renewed interest in the Belarusian language (See also: [[Homan (1884)]], [[Francishak Bahushevich|Bahushevich]], [[Yefim Karskiy]], [[Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapol'skiy|Dovnar-Zapol'skiy]], Bessonov, Pypin, Sheyn, Nosovich). The Belarusian literary tradition was also renewed (''see also'': [[Francishak Bahushevich|F. Bahushevich]]). It was in these times that F. Bahushevich made his famous appeal to Belarusians: "Do not forsake our language, lest you pass away" ({{lang-be|Не пакідайце ж мовы нашай, каб не ўмёрлі|links=no}}).

In course of the 1897 [[Russian Empire Census]], about 5.89&amp;nbsp;million people declared themselves speakers of Belarusian.

|}&lt;/div&gt;

The end of the 19th century, however, still showed that the urban language of Belarusian towns remained either Polish or Russian. The same census showed that towns with a population greater than 50,000 had fewer than a tenth Belarusian speakers. This state of affairs greatly contributed to a perception that Belarusian was a "rural" and "uneducated" language.

However, the census was a major breakthrough for the first steps of the Belarusian national self-awareness and identity, since it clearly showed to the Imperial authorities and the still-strong Polish minority that the population and the language were neither Polish nor Russian.

=== 1900s–1910s ===
The rising influence of Socialist ideas advanced the emancipation of the Belarusian language still further (''see also:'' [[Belarusian Socialist Assembly]], [[Circle of Belarusian People's Education and Belarusian Culture]], [[Belarusian Socialist Lot]], [[Socialist Party "White Russia"]], [[Alaiza Pashkievich]], [[Nasha Dolya]]). The fundamental works of [[Yefim Karskiy]] marked a turning point in the scientific perception of Belarusian. The ban on publishing books and papers in Belarusian was officially removed (25 December 1904). The unprecedented surge of national feeling in the 20th century, especially among the workers and peasants, particularly after the events of 1905,&lt;ref&gt;[Dovnar 1926] Ch. XXI Sec.4 p.480-481&lt;/ref&gt; gave momentum to the intensive development of Belarusian literature and press (See also: [[Naša niva]], [[Yanka Kupala]], [[Yakub Kolas]]).

==== Grammar ====
During the 19th and early 20th century, there was no normative Belarusian grammar. Authors wrote as they saw fit, usually representing the particularities of different Belarusian dialects. The scientific groundwork for the introduction of a truly scientific and modern grammar of the Belarusian language was laid down by the linguist [[Yefim Karskiy]].

By the early 1910s, the continuing lack of a codified Belarusian grammar was becoming intolerably obstructive in the opinion of uniformitarian prescriptivists. Then Russian academician [[Aleksey Shakhmatov|Shakhmatov]], chair of the Russian language and literature department of St. Petersburg University, approached the board of the Belarusian newspaper ''[[Naša niva]]'' with a proposal that a Belarusian linguist be trained under his supervision in order to be able to create documentation of the grammar. Initially, the famous Belarusian poet [[Maksim Bahdanovich]] was to be entrusted with this work. However, Bahdanovich's poor health (tuberculosis) precluded his living in the climate of St. Petersburg, so [[Branislaw Tarashkyevich]], a fresh graduate of the [[Vilnya Liceum No. 2]], was selected for the task.

In the Belarusian community, great interest was vested in this enterprise. The already famous Belarusian poet [[Yanka Kupala]], in his letter to Tarashkyevich, urged him to "hurry with his much-needed work". Tarashkyevich had been working on the preparation of the grammar during 1912–1917, with the help and supervision of Shakhmatov and Karskiy. Tarashkyevich had completed the work by the autumn of 1917, even moving from the tumultuous Petrograd of 1917 to the relative calm of Finland in order to be able to complete it uninterrupted. &lt;!-- Lyosik --&gt;

By the summer of 1918, it became obvious that there were insurmountable problems with the printing of Tarashkyevich's grammar in Petrograd: a lack of paper, type and qualified personnel. Meanwhile, his grammar had apparently been planned to be adopted in the workers' and peasants' schools of Belarus that were to be set up,&lt;!-- ref to decrees --&gt; so Tarashkyevich was permitted to print his book abroad. &lt;!-- by who? ref? --&gt; In June 1918, he arrived in &lt;!-- then occupied by who --&gt;[[Vilnius]], via Finland. The [[Belarusian Committee]] petitioned the administration to allow the book to be printed. Finally, the first edition of the "Belarusian grammar for schools" was printed ([[Vilnius|Vil'nya]], 1918).

There existed at least two other contemporary attempts at codifying the Belarusian grammar.&lt;!-- ref to Lyosik --&gt; In 1915, Rev. [[Balyaslaw Pachopka]] had prepared a Belarusian grammar using the Latin script. Belarusian linguist S. M. [[Stepan Nyekrashevich|Nyekrashevich]] considered Pachopka's grammar unscientific and ignorant of the principles of the language.&lt;!-- reference! political? --&gt; But Pachopka's grammar was reportedly taught in an unidentified number of schools, from 1918 for an unspecified period,. Another grammar was supposedly jointly prepared by A. Lutskyevich and Ya. Stankyevich, and differed from Tarashkyevich's grammar somewhat in the resolution of some key aspects.&lt;!-- refs Lyosik, stankyevich--&gt;&lt;!-- critics by Stankyevich?? --&gt;&lt;!-- yet another grammars: Lyosik, Stankyevich, 5ed, 8ed, 2005 --&gt;

=== 1914–1917 ===
On 22 December 1915, [[Paul von Hindenburg]] issued an order on schooling in German Army-occupied territories in the [[Russian Empire]] ([[Ober Ost]]), banning schooling in [[Russian language|Russian]] and including the Belarusian language in an exclusive list of four languages made mandatory in the respective native schooling systems (Belarusian, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Yiddish]]). School attendance was not made mandatory, though. Passports at this time were bilingual, in [[German language|German]] and in one of the "native languages".&lt;ref&gt;Turonek 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Also at this time, Belarusian preparatory schools, printing houses, press organs were opened (''see also:'' [[Homan (1916)]]).

=== 1917–1920 ===
After the 1917 February Revolution in Russia, the Belarusian language became an important factor in political activities in the Belarusian lands (''see also:'' [[Central Council of Belarusian Organisations]], [[Great Belarusian Council]], [[First All-Belarusian Congress]], [[Belnatskom]]). In the [[Belarusian People's Republic]], Belarusian was used as the only official language (decreed by Belarusian People's Secretariat on 28 April 1918). Subsequently, in the [[Belarusian SSR]], Belarusian was decreed to be one of the four (Belarusian, Polish, Russian, and Yiddish) official languages (decreed by Central Executive Committee of BSSR in February 1921).

=== 1920–1930 ===

==== Soviet Belarus ====

A decree of 15 July 1924 confirmed that the Belarusian, Russian, Yiddish and Polish languages had equal status in Soviet Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;Gennady Estraikh: ''Soviet Yiddish. Language Planning and Linguistic Development.'' Oxford: Clarendon, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the BSSR, Tarashkyevich's grammar had been officially accepted for use in state schooling after its re-publication in unchanged form, first in 1922 by [[Yazep Lyosik]] under his own name as ''Practical grammar. P[art]. I'', then in 1923 by the Belarusian State Publishing House under the title ''Belarusian language. Grammar. Ed. I. 1923'', also by "Ya. Lyosik".

In 1925, Lyosik added two new chapters, addressing the orthography of compound words and partly modifying the orthography of assimilated words. From this point on, Belarusian grammar had been popularized and taught in the educational system in that form. The ambiguous and insufficient development of several components of Tarashkyevich's grammar was perceived to be the cause of some problems in practical usage, and this led to discontent with the grammar.

In 1924–25, Lyosik and his brother Anton Lyosik prepared and published their project of orthographic reform, proposing a number of radical changes. A fully [[phonetic orthography]] was introduced. One of the most distinctive changes brought in was the principle of [[akanye]] ({{lang-be|́аканне|links=no}}), wherein unstressed "o", pronounced in both Russian and Belarusian as /a/, is written as "а".

The Belarusian Academic Conference on Reform of the Orthography and Alphabet was convened in 1926. After discussions on the project, the Conference made resolutions on some of the problems. However, the Lyosik brothers' project had not addressed all the problematic issues, so the Conference was not able to address all of those.

As the outcome of the conference, the Orthographic Commission was created to prepare the project of the actual reform. This was instigated on 1 October 1927, headed by S. Nyekrashevich, with the following principal guidelines of its work adopted:
* To consider the resolutions of the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926) non-mandatory, although highly competent material.
* To simplify Tarashkyevich's grammar where it was ambiguous or difficult in use, to amend it where it was insufficiently developed (e.g., orthography of assimilated words), and to create new rules if absent (orthography of proper names and geographical names).

During its work in 1927–29, the Commission had actually prepared the project for spelling reform. The resulting project had included both completely new rules and existing rules in unchanged and changed forms, some of the changes being the work of the Commission itself, and others resulting from the resolutions of the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926), re-approved by the Commission.

Notably, the use of the ''Ь'' (soft sign) before the combinations "consonant+iotified vowel" ("softened consonants"), which had been previously denounced as highly redundant (e.g., in the proceedings of the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926)), was cancelled. However, the complete resolution of the highly important issue of the orthography of unstressed ''Е'' (''IE'') was not achieved.

Both the resolutions of the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926) and the project of the Orthographic Commission (1930) caused much disagreement in the Belarusian academic environment. Several elements of the project were to be put under appeal in the "higher (political) bodies of power".

==== West Belarus ====
In [[West Belarus]], under Polish rule, the Belarusian language was at a disadvantage. Schooling in the Belarusian language was obstructed, and printing in Belarusian experienced political oppression.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The prestige of the Belarusian language in the Western Belarus of the period hinged significantly on the image of the BSSR being the "true Belarusian home".&lt;ref&gt;(words of V. Lastouski)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=April 2011}} This image, however, was strongly disrupted by the [[Soviet repressions in Belarus|"purges" of "national-democrats" in BSSR]] (1929–30) and by the subsequent grammar reform (1933).

Tarashkyevich's grammar was re-published five times in Western Belarus. However, the 5th edition (1929) (reprinted verbatim in Belarus in 1991 and often referred to) was the version diverging from the previously published one, which Tarashkyevich had prepared disregarding the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926) resolutions.{{harv|Тарашкевіч|1991|loc=Foreword}}

===1930s===

====Soviet Belarus====

In 1929–30, the Communist authorities of Soviet Belarus made a series of drastic crackdowns against the supposed "national-democratic counter-revolution" (informally "nats-dems" ({{lang-be|нац-дэмы|links=no}})). Effectively, entire generations of Socialist Belarusian national activists in the first quarter of the 20th century were wiped out of political, scientific and social existence. Only the most famous cult figures (e.g. [[Yanka Kupala]]) were spared.

However, a new power group in Belarusian science quickly formed during these power shifts, under the virtual leadership of the Head of the Philosophy Institute of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, academician S. Ya. Vol’fson ({{lang|be|С. Я. Вольфсон}}). The book published under his editorship, ''Science in Service of Nats-Dems’ Counter-Revolution'' (1931), represented the new spirit of political life in Soviet Belarus.

=====1933 reform of Belarusian grammar=====
The Reform of Belarusian Grammar (1933) had been brought out quite unexpectedly, supposedly [Stank 1936],  with the project published in the central newspaper of the Belarusian Communist Party (''[[Zviazda]])'' on 1933-06-28 and the decree of the Council of People's Commissars (Council of Ministers) of BSSR issued on 1933-08-28, to gain the status of law on 1933-09-16.

There had been some post-facto speculations, too, that the 1930 project of the reform (as prepared by people who were no longer seen as politically "clean"), had been given for the "purification" to the "nats-dems" competition in the Academy of Sciences, which would explain the "block" nature of the differences between the 1930 and 1933 versions. Peculiarly, [[Yan Stankyevich]] in his notable critique of the reform [Stank 1936] failed to mention the 1930 project, dating the reform project to 1932.
&lt;!-- resume here --&gt;
The reform resulted in the grammar officially used, with further amendments, in [[Byelorussian SSR]] and modern [[Belarus]]. Sometimes this grammar is called the ''official'' grammar of the Belarusian language, to distinguish it from the ''pre-reform'' grammar, known as the ''classic'' grammar or [[Taraškievica]] (Tarashkevitsa). It is also known as ''narkamauka'', after the word ''narkamat'', a Belarusian abbreviation for [[People's Commissariat]] (ministry). The latter term bears a derogatory connotation.

The officially announced causes for the reform were:
* The pre-1933 grammar was maintaining artificial barriers between the Russian and Belarusian languages.
* The reform was to cancel the influences of the Polonisation corrupting the Belarusian language.
* The reform was to remove the [[archaism]]s, [[neologism]]s and vulgarisms supposedly introduced by the "national-democrats".
* The reform was to simplify the grammar of the Belarusian language.

The reform had been accompanied by a fervent press campaign directed against the "nats-dems not yet giving up."

The decree had been named ''On Changing and Simplifying Belarusian Spelling'' ({{lang|be|«Аб зменах і спрашчэнні беларускага правапісу»}}), but the bulk of the changes had been introduced into the grammar. [[Yan Stankyevich]] in his critique of the reform talked about 25 changes, with one of them being strictly orthographical and 24 relating to both orthography and grammar. [Stank 1936]

Many of the changes in the orthography proper ("stronger principle of AH-ing," "no redundant soft sign," "uniform ''nye'' and ''byez''") were, in fact, simply implementations of earlier proposals made by people who had subsequently suffered political suppression (e.g., Yazep Lyosik, Lastowski, Nyekrashevich, 1930 project).&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=Да рэформы беларускага правапісу |title=Пасяджэньні Беларускае Акадэмічнае Конфэрэнцыі па рэформе правапісу і азбукі |place=Мн.: [б. м.] |year=1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ян Станкевіч. Б. Тарашкевіч |chapter=Беларуская граматыка для школ. Выданьне пятае пераробленае і пашыранае. Вільня. 1929 г., бал. 132 + IV [1930–1931] |title=Ян Станкевіч. Збор твораў у двух тамах. Т. 1. |place=Мн. |publisher=Энцыклапедыкс |year=2002 |isbn=985-6599-46-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [Padluzhny 2004]

The morphological principle in the orthography had been strengthened, which also had been proposed in 1920s.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;

The "removal of the influences of the Polonisation" had been represented, effectively, by the:
* Reducing the use of the "consonant+non-iotified vowel" in assimilated Latinisms in favour of "consonant+iotified vowel," leaving only Д, Т, Р ''unexceptionally'' "hard."
* Changing the method of representing the sound "L" in Latinisms to another variant of the Belarusian sound Л (of 4 variants existing), rendered with succeeding non-iotified vowels instead of iotified.
* Introducing the new preferences of use of the letters Ф over Т for ''theta'', and В over Б for ''beta'', in Hellenisms. [Stank 1936]

The "removing of the artificial barriers between the Russian and Belarusian languages" (virtually the often-quoted "Russification of the Belarusian language," which may well happen to be a term coined by Yan Stankyevich) had, according to Stankyevich, moved the normative Belarusian morphology and syntax closer to their Russian counterparts, often removing from use the indigenous features of the Belarusian language. [Stank 1936]

Stankyevich also observed that some components of the reform had moved the Belarusian grammar to the grammars of other Slavonic languages, which would hardly be its goal. [Stank 1936]

====West Belarus====
In [[West Belarus]], there had been some voices raised against the reform, chiefly by the non-Communist/non-socialist wing of the Belarusian national scene. Yan Stankyevich was named to the Belarusian Scientific Society, Belarusian National Committee and Society of the Friends of Belarusian Linguistics at Wilno University. Certain political and scientific groups and figures went on using the pre-reform orthography and grammar, however, thus multiplying and differing versions.

However, the reformed grammar and orthography had been used, too, for example during the process of [[Siarhei Prytytski]] in 1936.

===Second World War===

During the [[Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany]] (1941–1944), the Belarusian collaborationists influenced newspapers and schools to use the Belarusian language. This variant did not use any of the post-1933 changes in vocabulary, orthography and grammar. Much publishing in [[Belarusian Latin alphabet|Belarusian Latin script]] was done. In general, in the publications of the [[Soviet partisans|Soviet partisan movement]] in Belarus, the normative 1934 grammar was used.

=== Post Second World War ===

After the Second World War, several major factors influenced the development of the Belarusian language. The most important was the implementation of the "[[russification|rapprochement and unification of Soviet people]]" policy, which resulted by the 1980s in the Russian language effectively and officially assuming the role of the principal means of communication, with Belarusian relegated to a secondary role. The post-war growth in the number of publications in the Belarusian language in BSSR drastically lagged behind those in Russian. The use of Belarusian as the main language of education was gradually limited to rural schools and humanitarian faculties. The BSSR counterpart of the USSR law "On strengthening of ties between school and real life and on the further development of popular education in the USSR" (1958), adopted in 1959, along with introduction of a mandatory 8-year school education, made it possible for the parents of pupils to opt for non-mandatory studying of the "second language of instruction," which would be Belarusian in a Russian language school and vice versa. However, for example in the 1955/56 school year, there were 95% of schools with Russian as the primary language of instruction, and 5% with Belarusian as the primary language of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Станкевіч С. |title=Русіфікацыя беларускае мовы ў БССР і супраціў русіфікацыйнаму працэсу [1962]. / Прадмова В. Вячоркі. |place=Мн. |publisher=Навука і тэхніка |year=1994 |isbn=5-343-01645-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While officially much lauded, the language was popularly represented as an "uncultured, rural language of rural people"{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}.

That was the source of concern for the nationally minded and caused, for example, the series of publications by [[Barys Sachanka]] in 1957–61 and the text named "Letter to a Russian Friend" by [[Alyaksyey Kawka]] (1979). The BSSR Communist party leader [[Kirill Mazurov]] made some tentative moves to strengthen the role of Belarusian language in the second half of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Modern history of Belarus'' by Mironowicz.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the support for the Belarusian language could also be easily considered "too strong" and even identified with the support of "Belarusian nationalists and fascists".

After the beginning of Perestroika and the relaxing of political control in the late 1980s, a new campaign in support of the Belarusian language was mounted in BSSR, expressed in the "Letter of 58" and other publications, producing a certain level of popular support and resulting in the BSSR Supreme Soviet ratifying the "Law on Languages" ("{{lang|be|Закон аб мовах}}"; 26 January 1990) requiring the strengthening of the role of Belarusian in state and civic structures.

==== 1959 reform of grammar ====

A discussion on problems in Belarusian orthography and on the further development of the language was held from 1935–1941. From 1949–1957 this continued, although it was deemed there was a need to amend some unwarranted changes to the 1933 reform. The Orthography Commission, headed by [[Yakub Kolas]], set up the project in about 1951, but it was approved only in 1957, and the normative rules were published in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;The BSSR Council of Ministers approved the project of the Commission on Orthography "On making more precise and on partially changing the acting rules of Belarusian orthography" ({{lang|be|«Аб удакладненні і частковых зменах існуючага беларускага правапісу»}}) on 11 May 1957. The project served as a basis for the normative ''Rules of the Belarusian Orthography and Punctuation'' ({{lang|be|«Правілы беларускай арфаграфіі і пунктуацыі»}}), published in 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; This grammar had been accepted as normative for the Belarusian language since then, receiving minor practical changes in the 1985 edition.

A project to correct parts of the 1959 grammar was conducted from 2006 to 2007.

=== Post-1991 ===
After Belarus became independent in 1991, the Belarusian language gained in prestige and popular interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=00331538&amp;AN=75063402&amp;h=sJfl1nBh%2byv2sJFaixhQPWfp5%2f4sZqWUHDINT1BLRIPmi4UY3AtgPRh6dOSqn7Mhmpbd94ZXmMR69K1BXpSJ3g%3d%3d&amp;crl=f&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d00331538%26AN%3d75063402|title=Internationalizing teacher education: The case of Belarus|last=|first=|date=Mar 2012|website=|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} However, the implementation of the 1992–94 "Law on Languages" took place in such a way that it provoked public protests and was dubbed "Landslide Belarusization" and "undemocratic" by those opposing it in 1992–94{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

In a [[Belarusian referendum, 1995|controversial referendum]] held on 14 May 1995 the Belarusian language lost its exclusive status as the only [[state language]]. State support for Belarusian language and culture in general has dwindled since then, and Russian is dominant in everyday life in today's Belarus.&lt;ref name=Brli2010/&gt; In a 2006 article, [[Roy Medvedev]] compared the position of the Belarusian language in Belarus with that of the [[Irish language]] in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Медведев |first1= Р.|last2= |first2= |date= March 2006 |title= Непрерывное развитие языков: их влияние друг на друга и конкуренция |url= http://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/4556 |journal= Наука и жизнь |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= 2017-11-23 | quote = Положение дел с языком в Белоруссии сходно с положением в Ирландии.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spelling reform of the official Belarusian language, making the spelling of some words more similar to Taraškievič's system, was decided on July 23, 2008, and went into effect on September 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;
A detailed account can be found in the article [[:be-tarask:Правілы беларускай артаграфіі і пунктуацыі (2008)]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrimination against Belarusian speakers===
Under the regime of the authoritarian president [[Alexander Lukashenko]], members of the Belarusian speaking minority in Belarus complain about a discrimination of the Belarusian language in Belarus.&lt;ref name=us2008&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=O5rs8UkMj64C&amp;pg=PA1163&amp;lpg=PA1163&amp;dq=discrimination+belarusian+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6C27faQm2x&amp;sig=3ihFUzlf-XRLEhFFjU86CYbWb0Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-z8LMj-TXAhVOJ1AKHSPNB5AQ6AEIUDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=discrimination%20belarusian%20language&amp;f=false|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2007|year=2008|publisher=House, Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations - 2008|page=1163|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a formally equal status of Russian and Belarusian, Russian is primarily used by the Belarusian government, and cases of discrimination against the Belarusian language are not rare, even though the discrimination is not institutionalized. Authorities occasionally make minor concessions to demands for a widening of the usage of the Belarusian language.&lt;ref name=us2008/&gt;

Organizations promoting Belarusian language such as the [[Frantsishak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society]] were reported being object of attacks by Belarus-based [[Russian nationalism|Russian neo-Nazi groups]] in the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref name=us2008/&gt;

The [[Frantsishak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society]] has reported about the following categories of violations of the rights of Belarusian speakers in Belarus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbm-mova.by/monitoring15.html?lang=en|title=A review of language policy in Belarus|date=3 April 2012|publisher=[[Frantsishak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society]]|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The right to receive public and private services in Belarusian language;
* The right to access legislation in Belarusian language;
* The right to receive education in Belarusian language;
* The right to an equitable presence of Belarusian language in the media;
* The right to receive full oral and written information in Belarusian language on the products and services proposed by commercial companies.

Belarusian speakers are facing numerous obstacles when trying to arrange Belarusian language education for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spring96.org/en/news/75147|title=Parents of Belarusian-language pupils in Baranavichy petition Prosecutor General over discrimination|date=19 January 2015|publisher=Viasna Human Rights Center|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of | 2016}} there are no Belarusian-language universities in the country.&lt;ref name=Brli2010&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://m.dw.com/uk/білоруська-мова-в-білорусі-державний-статус-чи-декорація/a-19063646?maca=ukr-VGUS-Link-YedynkaUpMobileManual-dwukr Belarusian language in Belarus: state status or scenery?], [[DW.com]] (22 February 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2016 country human rights on Belarus report, the US State Department also stated that there was "discrimination against ... those who sought to use the Belarusian language."&lt;ref name=statedep2016/&gt; "Because the government viewed many proponents of the Belarusian language as political opponents, authorities continued to harass and intimidate academic and cultural groups that sought to promote Belarusian and routinely rejected proposals to widen use of the language," the report said.&lt;ref name=statedep2016&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2016&amp;dlid=265398#wrapper|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016|year=2017|publisher=US Department of State Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
In the 2010s the situation of Belarusian has started to change slightly due to the efforts of language-advocacy institutions, of individual representatives of such educational, cultural, scientific and linguistic organizations as the [[Frantsishak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society]], the [[Belarus Academy of Sciences]], the [[Belarusian Writers' Union]], and in response to the endeavours of pro-Belarusian public figures from the media and communication field, musicians, philosophers, entrepreneurs and benefactors.&lt;ref name=Brli2010/&gt; And despite the language losing its exclusive position in the wake of the [[1995 Belarusian referendum]], new signs of the spread of Belarusian have appeared, trickling down into Belarusian society — with advertising campaigns supporting the cause (outdoor billboards promoting&lt;ref name=Brli2010/&gt; and acquainting people with the Belarusian language, branding campaigns for the leading telecommunication providers like Velcom, etc.), the simplified version of the [[Belarusian Latin alphabet]] on the metro map being introduced into the messages of the transport network, dedicated advertising festivals like AD!NAK upholding marketing communication in Belarusian, and informal language-courses (such as [[Mova Nanova]], Mova ci kava, Movavedy) having sprung up in Minsk and around Belarus and spurring further interest of people, especially of young people, in developing good Belarusian communication skills in [[everyday life]].

=== {{lang|be-Latn|Taraškievica}} or {{lang|be-Latn|Klasyčny pravapis}} (Classical orthography) ===
{{main|Taraškievica}}
{{Anchor|Taraškievica|Tarashkevica}}
There exists an alternative literary norm of the Belarusian language, named {{lang|be-Latn|Taraškievica}} ({{lang|be-Latn|Tarashkevica}}). The promoters and users of it prevalently refer to it as {{lang|be-Latn|Klasyčny pravapis}} (''Classic orthography'').

== Names ==
There are a number of names under which the Belarusian language has been known, both contemporary and historical.  Some of the most dissimilar are from the Old Belarusian period.

=== Official, romanised ===
* ''Belarusian'' (also spelled ''Belarusan'', ''Belarussian'', ''Byelarussian'') – derived from the name of the country "Belarus", officially approved for use abroad by the Belarusian authorities{{which|date=November 2015}} (ca. 1992) and promoted since then.
* ''Byelorussian'' (also spelled ''Belorussian'', ''Bielorussian'' ) – derived from the Russian name of the country "Byelorussia" ({{lang-ru|Белоруссия}}), used officially (in the [[Russian language]]) in the times of the [[USSR]] and, later, in [[Russia]]{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}.
* ''White Ruthenian'' (and its equivalents in other languages) – literally, a word-by-word translation of the parts of the composite word ''Belarusian''.

=== Alternative ===
* ''Great Lithuanian'' ({{lang|be|вялікалітоўская (мова)}}) – proposed and used by [[Yan Stankyevich]] since the 1960s, intended to part with the "diminishing tradition of having the name related to the Muscovite tradition of calling the Belarusian lands" and to pertain to the "great tradition of Belarusian statehood".
* ''Kryvian'' or ''Krivian'' ({{lang|be|крывіцкая/крывічанская/крыўская (мова)}}, {{lang-pl|język krewicki}}) – derived from the name of the Slavonic tribe [[Krivichi]], one of the main tribes in the foundations of the forming of the Belarusian nation. Created and used in the 19th century by Belarusian Polish-speaking writers Jaroszewicz, Narbut, Rogalski, [[Jan Czeczot]]. Strongly promoted by [[Vaclau Lastouski]].

=== Vernacular ===
* ''Simple'' ({{lang|be|простая (мова)}}) or ''[[Tutejszy|local]]'' ({{lang|be|тутэйшая (мова)}}) – used mainly in times preceding the common recognition of the existence of the Belarusian language, and nation in general. Supposedly, the term can still be encountered up to the end of the 1930s, e.g., in [[Western Belarus]].
* ''Simple Black Ruthenian'' ({{lang-ru|простой чернорусский}}) – used in the beginning of the 19th century by the Russian researcher Baranovski and attributed to contemporary vernacular Belarusian.&lt;ref&gt;Acc. to: Улащик Н. Введение в белорусско-литовское летописание. – Moscow, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer representation ==
Belarusian is represented by the [[ISO 639]] code ''be'' or ''bel'', or more specifically by [[IETF language tag]]s ''be-1959acad'' (so-called "Academic" ["governmental"] variant of Belarusian as codified in 1959) or ''be-tarask'' (Belarusian in Taraskievica orthography).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry |title=Type: language |date=2016-10-12 |website=Iana.org |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Braj Bhāshā''' is a [[Western Hindi languages|Western Hindi language]]. Along with [[Awadhi]] (a variety of Eastern Hindi), it was one of the two predominant literary languages of North-Central India before the switch to [[Khariboli]] in the 19th century.

Brij Bhasha is spoken by people in the nebulously defined region of [[Braj Bhoomi|Vraja Bhoomi]], which was a political state in the era of the [[Mahabharata]] wars.  According to ancient [[Hindu]] texts such as the [[Bhagavata Purana]], the [[Surasena|Kingdom of Surasena]] is described as spreading through the Brij (also known as Vrija or Vraja), where the incarnation of [[Vishnu]], [[Krishna]] was born and spent his childhood days. This region lies in the [[Agra]]-[[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]-[[Aligarh]] area, and stretches as far as the environs of [[Delhi]]. In modern India, this area lies mostly in northwestern [[Uttar Pradesh]], the eastern extremities of [[Rajasthan]] i.e. [[Bharatpur, Rajasthan|Bharatpur]] &amp; [[Dholpur]] and the southern extremities of [[Haryana]]. Northern regions of Madhya Pradesh like Morena are also included.&lt;ref name="google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sl_dDVctycgC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;dq=Braj+Bhasa+morena&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4Y2B90Sgc_&amp;sig=CfN_Q103lnt5C4KdJX_ge6cCRYI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z4jDVJXtN4GuUpiIgbgN&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Braj%20Bhasa%20morena&amp;f=false|title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics|work=google.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today Braj Bhoomi can be seen as a cultural-geographical entity rather than a proper state. It is the [[vernacular]] of the region and boasts a rich culture and literature by famous poets like [[Surdas]], [[Bhai Gurdas]] and [[Amir Khusro]]. Brij Bhasha is very close to [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]], spoken in the neighbouring [[Awadh]] region.

Much of the Hindi literature was developed in Braj in the medieval period. However, today [[Khariboli dialect]] has taken its place as the predominant standard dialect of [[Hindi languages|Hindi]].

In modern India, Braj Bhasha exists as an unofficial dialect spoken colloquially by natives of the region of Braj Bhoomi, with great cultural and religious significance. Much of Hindi poetry, especially that of '[[Bhakti]]' or devotional poetry is in this language. Some devotional poems for Krishna are also composed in Braj Bhasha. The pioneering [[Urdu language|Urdu]] poet [[Amir Khusrow]], also spoke and composed poetry in this language. Famous Braj Bhasha folk songs or poems include [[Chhaap Tilak Sab Chheeni]] by [[Amir Khusro]], and the popular devotional song, [[Main Naahin Maakhan Khaayo]] by Surdas. Braj Bhasha is also the main language of [[Hindustani classical music]] compositions.

== Geographical distribution ==

Braj Bhasha is mainly a rural tongue currently, predominant in the nebulous [[Braj]] region centred on [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] &amp; [[Agra]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]] and  [[Bharatpur, Rajasthan|Bharatpur]] &amp; [[Dholpur]] in [[Rajasthan]]. It is the predominant language in the central stretch of the Ganges-Yamuna [[Doab]] in the following districts:
* [[Hathras district|Hathras]]
* [[Mathura district|Mathura]]
* [[Agra district|Agra]]
* [[Aligarh district|Aligarh]]
* [[Firozabad district|Firozabad]]
* [[Auraiya District|Auraiya]]
* [[Etah district|Etah]]
* [[Mainpuri]]
* [[Etawah district|Etawah]]
* [[Bulandshahr district|Bulandshahr]]
* [[Noida]] 
* [[Farrukhabad]]
* [[Kasganj]]
* [[Badaun]]

It stretches across the [[Ganges]] into the non-Doabi districts of [[Badaun district|Badaun]] and [[Bareilly district|Bareilly]] and goes up to the foothills of [[Nainital]] at [[Udham Singh Nagar district|Udham Singh Nagar]] in [[Uttarakhand]].

Besides Uttar Pradesh, it is spoken in the bordering areas of [[Rajasthan]], mainly in the following districts:

* [[Bharatpur district|Bharatpur]]
* [[Dhaulpur district|Dhaulpur]]

as well as parts of [[Karauli district|Karauli]], from where onwards it merges into [[Rajasthani languages]].

It is also spoken in the eastern areas of [[Uttar Pradesh]], mainly in [[Mathura district]] and eastern areas of [[Palwal district|Palwal]] and [[Noida district|Noida]] districts. 

In Madhya Pradesh it is spoken in the districts of [[Bhind]], [[Morena]], [[Gwalior]], and [[Shivpuri]].&lt;ref name="google.co.uk"/&gt;
It is spoken in several villages of [[Mathura]], specially in [[Vrindavan]], [[Madhuvan]], [[Kaman, Uttar Pradesh|Kaman]], [[Kosi Kalan]], [[Baldeo]], and all other villages belongs to Braj Area with [[Bajna, India|Bajna]], [[Surir]], [[Bhidauni]],

== Literature ==
{{main| Braj Bhasha literature}}
Most Braj Bhasha literature is of a mystical nature, related to the spiritual union of people with God, because almost all of the Braj Bhasha poets were considered God-realised saints and their words are thus considered as directly emanating from a divine source. Much of the traditional Northern Indian literature shares this trait. All traditional Punjabi literature is similarly written by saints and is of a metaphysical and philosophical nature.

Another peculiar feature of Northern Indian literature is that the literature is mostly written from a female point of view, even by male poets. This is because the saints were in a state of transcendental, spiritual love, where they were metaphorically women reuniting with their beloved. (In its inversion of the conventional genders of worshipper and worshippee, Maulana Da’ud's [[Chandayan]] departs from this tradition.)

Important works in Braj Bhasha are:  
* Yugala Shataka by Swami Sri Sribhatta Devacarya; known as the first 'Vani' book in Vraja Bhasha composed in the 14th Century AD as a part of [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]] tradition of [[Radha]] [[Krishna]] worship.
* [[Vinaya Patrika]] by [[Tulsidas]]
* [[Sur Sagar]] by [[Surdas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/notebook/public/03553967701179803178/BDQs4SwoQx5vXjbQh|title=Google Notebook|work=google.com|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Buddha Charit by [[Acharya Ram Chandra Shukla]]
* [[Sufi]] poetry by [[Amir Khusro]]
* Eulogies by [[Kavi Bhushan]]
* ''Vrind Satsai'' by [[Vrind]] (1643 - 1723), court poet of ruler of [[Kishangarh]]&lt;ref name="Mukherjee1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sujit Mukherjee|title=A Dictionary of Indian Literature: Beginnings-1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCJrUfVtZxoC&amp;pg=PA425|date= 1998|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-1453-9|pages=425–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}
A '''carbon project''' refers to a business initiative that receives funding because of the cut the emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) will result. To prove that the project will result in real, permanent, verifiable reductions in Greenhouse Gases, proof must be provided in the form of a project design document and activity reports validated by an approved third party.

==Reasons for carbon project development==
Carbon projects are developed for reasons of voluntary environmental [[stewardship]], as well as legal compliance under a [[Emissions trading|Greenhouse Gas Cap &amp; Trade]] program. Voluntary carbon (GHG) reducers may wish to [[monetize]] reductions in their [[carbon footprint]] by trading the reductions in exchange for monetary compensation. The transfer of environmental stewardship rights would then allow another entity to make an environmental stewardship claim. There are several developing voluntary reduction standards that projects can use as guides for development.

==Kyoto Protocol==
Carbon projects have become increasingly important since the advent of [[emissions trading]] under Phase I of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 2005. They may be used if the project has been validated by a [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) Designated Operational Entity (DOE) according to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]. The resulting emissions reductions may become [[Certified Emission Reduction|Certified Emissions Reduction]]s (CERs) when a DOE has produced a verification report which has been submitted to the CDM Executive Board (EB).

There may be new project methodology validated by the CDM EB for post phase II Kyoto trading.

==United States==
In the [[United States]] standards similar to those of the Kyoto Protocol schemes are developing around [[California]]'s [[AB-32]] and the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] (RGGI).  Offset projects can be of many types, but only those that have proven additionality are likely to become [[Monetization|monetized]] under a future U.S. Cap &amp; Trade program.

One example of such a project, the Valley Wood Carbon Sequestration Project, receives funding from a partnership that was developed by Verus Carbon Neutral that links 17 merchants of Atlanta's Virginia-Highland shopping and dining neighborhood retail district, through the Chicago Climate Exchange, to directly fund the thousands of acres of forest in rural Georgia. The unique partnership established Virginia-Highland as the first Carbon-Neutral Zone in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Jay | first = Kate | title = First Carbon Neutral Zone Created in the United States | date = November 14, 2008 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS164153+14-Nov-2008+PRN20081114 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Auchmutey | first = Jim | title = Trying on carbon-neutral trend |newspaper=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | date = January 26, 2009 | url = http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2009/01/26/carbon0126b.html | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
An entity whose greenhouse gas emissions are capped by a regulatory program has three choices for complying if they exceed their cap. First, they could pay an alternative compliance measure or "carbon tax", a default payment set by the regulatory body.  This choice is usually the least attractive given the ability to comply by trading.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

The second option is to purchase [[carbon credit]]s within an [[emissions trading]] scheme. The trade provides an economic disincentive to the polluter, while providing an incentive to the less polluting organisation. As [[fossil fuel]] generation becomes less attractive it will be increasingly unattractive to exceed a carbon cap because the financial disincentive will grow via market forces. The price of a carbon allowance would go up because supply would decline while demand stays constant (assuming a positive growth rate for energy consumption).

The final option is to invest in a carbon project.  The carbon project will result in a greenhouse gas emission reduction which can be used to offset the excess emissions generated by the polluter. The financial disincentive to pollute is in the form of the capital expenditure to develop the project or the cost of purchasing the offset from the developer of the project. In this case the financial incentive would go to the owner of the carbon project.

==Project selection==
The most important part of developing a carbon project is establishing and documenting the [[additionality]] of the project - that the carbon project would not have otherwise occurred. It is also essential to document the measurement and the verification [[methodology]] applied, as outlined in the project development document.

Developing a carbon project is appropriate for [[renewable energy]] projects such as [[wind power|wind]], [[solar power|solar]], low impact-small [[hydropower|hydro]], [[biomass]], and [[biogas]]. Projects have also been developed for a wide variety of other emissions reductions such as [[reforestation]], fuel switching, [[carbon capture and storage]], and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].

[[File:Chineseexclusionact.JPG|thumb|upright|The first page of the Chinese Exclusion Act]]

The '''Chinese Exclusion Act''' was a [[United States Code|United States federal law]] signed by President [[Chester A. Arthur]] on May 6, 1882, prohibiting all immigration of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] laborers. Building on the 1875 [[Page Act]], which banned Chinese women from immigrating to the [[United States]], the Chinese Exclusion Act was the first law implemented to prevent all members of a specific ethnic or national group from immigrating. 

The act followed the [[Angell Treaty of 1880]], a set of revisions to the U.S.–China [[Burlingame Treaty]] of 1868 that allowed the U.S. to suspend [[Chinese American history|Chinese immigration]]. The act was initially intended to last for 10 years, but was renewed in 1892 with the [[Geary Act]] and made permanent in 1902. It was repealed by the [[Magnuson Act]] on December 17, 1943, which allowed 105 Chinese to enter per year. Chinese immigration later increased with the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]], which abolished direct racial barriers, and later by [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], which abolished the [[National Origins Formula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://immigrants.harpweek.com/chineseamericans/1Introduction/BillWeiIntro.htm |title=The Chinese-American Experience: An Introduction |publisher=HarpWeek |accessdate=2014-02-05 |first1=William |last1=Wei |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126021457/http://immigrants.harpweek.com/ChineseAmericans/1Introduction/BillWeiIntro.htm |archivedate=2014-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese railroad workers in snow.jpg|thumb|Chinese immigrant workers building the [[Transcontinental Railroad]]]]

The first significant Chinese immigration to North America began with the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1848–1855 and it continued with subsequent large labor projects, such as the building of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. During the early stages of the gold rush, when surface gold was plentiful, [[Chinese Railroad Workers|the Chinese]] were tolerated by white people, if not well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Henry K.|title=The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present|publisher=A.

After being forcibly driven from mining by a mixture of state legislators and other miners ([[Foreign Miners' Tax Act of 1850|the Foreign Miner's Tax]]), the immigrant Chinese began to settle in enclaves in cities, mainly [[San Francisco]], and took up low-wage labor, such as restaurant and laundry work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pioneer Laundry Workers Assembly|first1=K of L.

Public opinion and law in California began to demonize Chinese workers and immigrants in any role, with the later half of the 1800s seeing a series of ever more restrictive laws being placed on Chinese labor, behavior and even living conditions.  While many of these legislative efforts were quickly overturned by the State Supreme Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1855 Cal. Stat. 194 Capitation Tax|url=http://libraryweb.uchastings.edu/library/research/special-collections/wong-kim-ark/1855%20Cal.%20Stat.%20194.pdf|website=UC Hastings College of the Law Library Summer 2001|publisher=UC Hastings College of the Law|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; many more [[Anti-Chinese legislation in the United States|anti-Chinese laws]] continued to be passed in both California and nationally.

In the early 1850s there was resistance to the idea of excluding Chinese migrant workers from immigration because they provided essential tax revenue which helped fill the fiscal gap of California.&lt;ref name=kanazawa/&gt; The Chinese Emperor at the time was supportive of the exclusion, citing his concerns that Chinese immigration to America would lead to a loss of labor for China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=THE EVENTS LEADING TO THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACTS|last=Wellborn|first=Mildred|publisher=|year=1913|isbn=|location=|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; But toward the end of the decade, the financial situation improved and subsequently, attempts to legislate Chinese exclusion became successful on the state level.&lt;ref name="kanazawa" /&gt; In 1858, the California Legislature passed a law that made it illegal for any person "of the Chinese or Mongolian races" to enter the state; however, this law was struck down by an unpublished opinion of the State Supreme Court in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://librarysource.uchastings.edu/library/research/special-collections/wong-kim-ark/1858%20Cal.%20Stat.%20295.pdf |title=Text of the Chinese Exclusion Act |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-05-05 |publisher=[[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505105756/http://librarysource.uchastings.edu/library/research/special-collections/wong-kim-ark/1858%20Cal.%20Stat.%20295.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese immigrant workers provided cheap labor and did not use any of the government infrastructure (schools, hospitals, etc.) because the Chinese migrant population was predominantly made up of healthy male adults.&lt;ref name=kanazawa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanazawa |first=Mark |title=Immigration, Exclusion, and Taxation: Anti-Chinese Legislation in Gold Rush California |journal=[[The Journal of Economic History]] |volume=65 |number=3 |date=September 2005 |pages=779–805 |publisher=Cambridge University Press on behalf of the Economic History Association |jstor=3875017 |doi=10.1017/s0022050705000288}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time passed and more and more Chinese migrants arrived in California, violence would often break out in cities such as Los Angeles.

Hayes]]. In 1879 however, California adopted a new Constitution, which explicitly authorized the state government to determine which individuals were allowed to reside in the state, and banned the Chinese from employment by corporations and state, county or municipal governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/archives/collections/1879/archive/1879-constitution.pdf|title=Constitution of the State of California, 1879|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516131106/http://www.sos.ca.gov/archives/collections/1879/archive/1879-constitution.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although debate exists over whether or not the anti-Chinese animus in California drove the federal government (the California Thesis), or whether or not Chinese racism was simply inherent in the country at that point, by 1882, the federal government was finally convinced to pass the Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned all immigration from China for a period of 10 years.

After the act was passed, most Chinese families were faced with a dilemma: stay in the United States alone or go back to China to reunite with their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chew |first1=Kenneth |last2=Liu |first2=John |title=Hidden in Plain Sight: Global Labor Force Exchange in the Chinese American Population, 1880–1940 |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=30 |number=1 |date=March 2004 |pages=57–78 |publisher=Population Council |jstor=3401498 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2004.00003.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although widespread dislike for the Chinese persisted well after the law itself was passed, of note is that some capitalists and entrepreneurs resisted their exclusion because they accepted lower wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Joaquin |title=The Chinese and the Exclusion Act |journal=The North American Review |volume=173 |number=541 |date=December 1901 |pages=782–789 |publisher=University of Northern Iowa |jstor=25105257 |jstor-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, federal law proscribed entry of an ethnic working group on the premise that it endangered the good order of certain localities. (The earlier [[Page Act of 1875]] had prohibited immigration of Asian forced laborers and sex workers, and the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] prohibited [[naturalization]] of non-white subjects.) The Act excluded Chinese laborers, meaning "skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining," from entering the country for ten years under penalty of imprisonment and deportation.&lt;ref name="mem"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/chinese6.html|title=Exclusion|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=2003-09-01|accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usn"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page47.htm |title=The People's Vote: Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) |journal=U.S. News &amp; World Report |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328223654/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page47.htm | archivedate=28 March 2007 | accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese exclusion article 1901.jpg|thumb|Front page of The San Francisco Call -November 20th 1901, Chinese Exclusion Convention]]

The Chinese Exclusion Act required the few non laborers who sought entry to obtain certification from the Chinese government that they were qualified to emigrate. However, this group found it increasingly difficult to prove that they were not laborers&lt;ref name="usn"/&gt; because the 1882 act defined excludables as “skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining.” Thus very few Chinese could enter the country under the 1882 law. Diplomatic officials and other officers on business, along with their house servants, for the Chinese government were also allowed entry as long as they had the proper certification verifying their credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=47&amp;page=transcript|title=Welcome to OurDocuments.gov|website=www.ourdocuments.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also affected the Chinese who had already settled in the United States. Any Chinese who left the United States had to obtain certifications for reentry, and the Act made Chinese immigrants permanent aliens by excluding them from U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref name="mem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usn"/&gt; After the Act's passage, Chinese men in the U.S. had little chance of ever reuniting with their wives, or of starting families in their new abodes.&lt;ref name="mem"/&gt;

Amendments made in 1884 tightened the provisions that allowed previous immigrants to leave and return, and clarified that the law applied to ethnic Chinese regardless of their country of origin. The [[Scott Act (1888)]] expanded upon the Chinese Exclusion Act, prohibiting reentry after leaving the U.S. Constitutionality of the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Scott Act was upheld by the Supreme Court in ''[[Chae Chan Ping v. United States]]'' (1889); the Supreme Court declared that "the power of exclusion of foreigners [is] an incident of sovereignty belonging to the government of the United States as a part of those sovereign powers delegated by the constitution." The Act was renewed for ten years by the 1892 [[Geary Act]], and again with no terminal date in 1902.&lt;ref name="usn"/&gt; When the act was extended in 1902, it required "each Chinese resident to register and obtain a certificate of residence. Without a certificate, he or she faced deportation."&lt;ref name="usn"/&gt;

Between 1882 and 1905, about 10,000 Chinese appealed against negative immigration decisions to federal court, usually via a petition for [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]].&lt;ref name="Daniel"&gt;{{cite web |last=Daniels |first=Roger |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/17.1/br_11.html |title=Book Review: Laws Harsh as Tigers: Chinese Immigrants and the Shaping of Modern Immigration Law—Lucy E.

In [[United States v. Ju Toy|''U.S.'' vs ''Ju Toy'']] (1905), the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed that the port inspectors and the Secretary of Commerce had final authority on who could be admitted. Ju Toy's petition was thus barred despite the fact that the district court found that he was an American citizen. The Supreme Court determined that refusing entry at a port does not require due process and is legally equivalent to refusing entry at a land crossing. All these developments, along with the extension of the act in 1902, triggered a boycott of U.S. goods in China between 1904 and 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonathan H.

One of the critics of the Chinese Exclusion Act was the anti-slavery/anti-imperialist Republican Senator [[George Frisbie Hoar]] of [[Massachusetts]] who described the Act as "nothing less than the legalization of racial discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniels|first=Roger|page=271|year=2002|title=Coming to America: A History of Immigration and Ethnicity in American Life|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0060505776}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was primarily meant to retain white superiority especially with regards to working privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/chinese-exclusion-act|title=Chinese Exclusion Act|last=|first=|date=2009|website=History.com|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws were driven largely by racial concerns; immigration of persons of other races was unlimited during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chin |first=Gabriel J. |date=1998 |title=Segregation's Last Stronghold: Race Discrimination and the Constitutional Law of Immigration |journal=UCLA Law Review |volume=46 |number=1 |ssrn=1121119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason why this Act was enacted was due to the fact that American citizens faced higher unemployment as compared to workers of Chinese descent mostly in the West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Immigration to the United States, 1789–1930|url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/exclusion.html|journal=Harvard university library open collections program|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, most people and unions strongly supported the Chinese Exclusion Act, including the [[American Federation of Labor]] and [[Knights of Labor]], a [[Trade union|labor union]], who supported it because it believed that industrialists were using Chinese workers as a wedge to keep wages low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kennedy |first1=David M. |last2=Cohen |first2=Lizabeth |last3=Bailey |first3=Thomas A. |title=The American Pageant |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |year=2002 |edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among labor and leftist organizations, the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] were the sole exception to this pattern. The IWW openly opposed the Chinese Exclusion Act from its inception in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Choi |first=Jennifer Jung Hee |title=The Rhetoric of Inclusion: The I.W.W. and Asian Workers |journal=Ex Post Facto: Journal of the History Students at San Francisco State University |volume=8 |issue= |year=1999 |pages=9 |url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/epf/journal_archive/volume_VIII,_1999/choi_j.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The only one barred out cph.3b48680.jpg|thumb|left|A political cartoon from 1882, showing a Chinese man being barred entry to the "Golden Gate of Liberty". The caption reads, "We must draw the line ''somewhere'', you know."]]

For all practical purposes, the Exclusion Act, along with the restrictions that followed it, froze the Chinese community in place in 1882. Limited immigration from China continued until the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943. From 1910 to 1940, the Angel Island Immigration Station on what is now [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island State Park]] in [[San Francisco Bay]] served as the processing center for most of the 56,113 Chinese immigrants who are recorded as immigrating or returning from China; upwards of 30% more who showed up were returned to China. Angel Island State Park was where the Chinese immigrants were accepted to stay in the United States or made to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunigan|first=Grace|date=January 1, 2017|title=The Chinese Exclusion Act: Why It Matters Today|url=https://scholarlycommons.susqu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=supr|journal=Scholarly commons|volume=8|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], which destroyed City Hall and the Hall of Records, many immigrants (known as "[[paper sons]]") claimed that they had familial ties to resident Chinese-American citizens. Whether these were true or not cannot be proven.

The Chinese Exclusion Act gave rise to the first great wave of commercial human smuggling, an activity that later spread to include other national and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zhang|first=Sheldon|title=Smuggling and trafficking in human beings: all roads lead to America|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|page=69|isbn=978-0-275-98951-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Exclusion Act also led to an expansion of the power of U.S. immigration law through its influence on Canada's policies on Chinese exclusion during this time because of the need for greater vigilance at the [[Canada–United States border|U.S.-Canada border]]. Shortly after the U.S. Chinese Exclusion Act, Canada established the [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1885]] which imposed a [[Head tax (Canada)|head tax]] on Chinese migrants entering Canada. After increasing pressure from the U.S. government, Canada finally established the [[Chinese Immigration Act, 1923]] which banned most forms of immigration by the Chinese to Canada. There was also a need for this kind of border control along the U.S-Mexico border, however, efforts to control the border went along a different path because Mexico was fearful of expanding imperial power of the U.S. and did not want U.S. interference in Mexico. Not only this, but [[Chinese immigration to Mexico]] was welcomed because the Chinese immigrants filled Mexico's labor needs. The Chinese Exclusion Act actually led to heightened Chinese immigration to Mexico because of exclusion by the U.S. Therefore, the U.S. resorted to heavily policing the border along Mexico.

Later, the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] restricted immigration even further, excluding all classes of Chinese immigrants and extending restrictions to other Asian immigrant groups.&lt;ref name="mem"/&gt; Until these restrictions were relaxed in the middle of the twentieth century, Chinese immigrants were forced to live a life separated from their families, and to build ethnic enclaves in which they could survive on their own ([[Chinatown]]).&lt;ref name="mem"/&gt;
The Chinese Exclusion Act did not address the problems that whites were facing; in fact, the Chinese were quickly and eagerly replaced by the Japanese, who assumed the role of the Chinese in society. Unlike the Chinese, some Japanese were even able to climb the rungs of society by setting up businesses or becoming truck farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Brinkley |title=American History: A Survey |edition=12th |isbn=978-0073280479}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Japanese were later targeted in the [[Immigration Act of 1924|National Origins Act of 1924]], which banned immigration from east Asia entirely.

In 1891 the Government of China refused to accept the U.S. Senator Mr. [[Henry W. Blair]] as U.S. Minister to China due to his abusive remarks regarding China during negotiation of the Chinese Exclusion Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eileen |last=Denza |title=Commentary to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations |edition=Third |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |page=51 |isbn=978-0199216857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Christian Rev. Dr. [[George F. Pentecost]] spoke out against western imperialism in China, saying: ''I personally feel convinced that it would be a good thing for America if the embargo on Chinese immigration were removed. I think that the annual admission of 100,000 into this country would be a good thing for the country. And if the same thing were done in the Philippines those islands would be a veritable Garden of Eden in twenty-five years. The presence of Chinese workmen in this country would, in my opinion, do a very great deal toward solving our labor problems. There is no comparison between the Chinaman, even of the lowest coolie class, and the man who comes here from Southeastern Europe, from Russia, or from Southern Italy. The Chinese are thoroughly good workers. That is why the laborers here hate them. I think, too, that the emigration to America would help the Chinese.

== The "Driving Out" period ==
Following the passed legislation of the Chinese Exclusion Act, a period known as the "Driving Out" era was born. In this period, many [[Anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States|anti-Chinese Americans]] sought out to physically force the Chinese communities to flee to other areas. Many of these outbreaks occurred in the Western states. [[Rock Springs massacre|The Rock Springs Chinese Massacre]] (1885) and the [[Hells Canyon massacre|Hells Canyon Massacre]] of 1887 are two notable events in history.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55136302|title=The Chinese in America : a narrative history|last=Iris.|first=Chang,|date=2004|origyear=2003|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0142004170|location=New York|oclc=55136302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rock Springs massacre of 1885  ===
The [[Rock Springs massacre]] occurred in 1885. In 1885, many enraged white miners in [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming]] felt threatened by the Chinese and blamed them for their unemployment. As a result of the job competition, white miners expressed their frustration in physical violence where they robbed, shot, and stabbed at Chinese in Chinatown. The Chinese quickly tried to flee but in doing so, many ended up burned alive in their homes, starved to death in hidden refuge, or exposed to animal predators of the mountains.  Some were successfully rescued by the passing train, but by the end of the event at least twenty-eight lives had been lost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In an attempt to appease the situation, the government intervened by sending federal troops to protect the Chinese. However, following the event, only compensations for destroyed property were paid. No-one was arrested nor held accountable for the atrocities committed during the riot.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Hells Canyon Massacre of 1887 ===
{{main|Hells Canyon Massacre}}
The massacre was named for the location where it took place, along the [[Snake River]] in [[Hells Canyon]] near the mouth of Deep Creek. The area contained many rocky cliffs and white rapids that together posed significant danger to human safety. Thirty-four Chinese miners were killed at the site. The miners were employed by Sam Yup company, one of the [[Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association#San Francisco|six largest Chinese companies]] at the time, worked in this area since October 1886. An accurate account of the event is still unclear to this day secondary to unreliable law enforcement at the time, biased news reporting, and lack of serious official investigations. However, it is speculated that the dead Chinese miners were not victims of natural causes, but rather victims of gun shot wounds during a robbery committed by a gang of seven armed horse thieves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

An amount of gold worth $4,000–$5,000 was estimated to have been stolen from the miners. The whereabouts of the gold were never recovered nor further investigated. Recently, attempts to formulate an accurate picture of the event were drawn from hidden copies of trial documents that contained grand jury indictment, depositions given by the accused, notes from the trial, and historical accounts of [[Wallowa County, Oregon|Wallowa County]] by J. Harland Horner and H. Ross Findley.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. Gregory |last=Nokes |title=A Most Daring Outrage: Murders at Chinese Massacre Cove, 1887 |date=Fall 2006 |accessdate=20 March 2007 |work=Oregon Historical Quarterly |volume=107 |number=3 |url=http://www.ohs.org/research-and-library/oregon-historical-quarterly/upload/Nokes_A-Most-Daring-Outrage_OHQ-Fall-2006_107_3.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128140548/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ohq/107.3/nokes.html |archivedate=28 January 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Horner and Findley accounts ====
Horner and Findley were both schoolboys at the time of the massacre but their accounts had glaring discrepancies. Findley believed the massacre was a planned event with more than just a motive to steal gold from the Chinese miners. He believed the arrested culprits wanted to eliminate the Chinese miners from the area as well, which they successfully accomplished. In contrast to most accounts, Findley only recalled 31 confirmed victims, and there was no mention of a trial. On the other hand, Horner believed that the event was a spur of the moment event and affected 34 confirmed victims. The school boys initially only had intentions to steal horses, but experienced difficulty crossing the river with the stolen horses. When the Chinese miners refused to loan their boats, the boys decided to take the boats by force.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== The bodies ====
Other disagreements on the motives could also be attributed to the fact that the bodies of the Chinese miners were only found downstream after two weeks. It is unclear if the mangled bodies found were due to human manslaughter or the aftermath of being thrown into turbulent waters. The rapids and brute force of the current could have mangled the bodies against the rocks. However, it is confirmed that the Chinese men were shot secondary to the gunshot wounds found on the bodies. Only ten bodies were identified on February 16, 1888: Chea-po, Chea-Sun, Chea-Yow, Chea-Shun, Chea Cheong, Chea Ling, Chea Chow, Chea Lin Chung, Kong Mun Kow, and Kong Ngan. Little is known about these identified men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== The aftermath ====
Shortly following the incident, the Sam Yup company of San Francisco hired Lee Loi who later hired Joseph K. Vincent, then U.S. Commissioner, to lead an investigation. Vincent submitted his investigative report to the Chinese consulate who tried unsuccessfully to obtain justice for the Chinese miners. At around the same time, other compensation reports were also unsuccessfully filed for earlier crimes inflicted on the Chinese. In the end, on October 19, 1888, Congress agreed to greatly under-compensate for the massacre and ignore the claims for the earlier crimes. Even though the amount was greatly underpaid, it was still a small victory to the Chinese who had low expectations for relief or acknowledgement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Current updates ====
The US Board on Geographic Names officially named the Deep Creek massacre site to the [[Chinese Massacre Cove]]. This served as the first ever official recognition of the crime. Additionally in June 2012, a memorial was established with private funds and donations for the Chinese miners that were murdered.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Issues of the Act ==
The Chinese Exclusion Act brought rigidity not only to the Chinese alone but to Caucasians and other races as well which lasted for about thirty years.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tian|first=Kelly|date=|title=The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and Its Impact on North American Society|url=http://www.kon.org/urc/v9/tian.html|journal=|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American economy suffered a great loss as a result of this Act.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some sources cite the Act as a sign of injustice and unfair treatment to the Chinese workers because the jobs they engaged in were mostly menial jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodenner|first=Chris|date=February 6, 2013|title=Chinese Exclusion Act; Issues and Controversies in American History|url=http://www.ndhs.org/s/1012/images/editor_documents/library/issues_and_controversies_in_american_history_-_chinese_exclusion_act.pdf?sessionid=7aa0a591-8d60-4578-ba02-e7cfe36e74ab&amp;cc=1|journal=|volume=|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bubonic plague in Chinatown ==
In 1900–1904 San Francisco suffered from the [[bubonic plague]]. It first struck [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]], causing people to fall ill and experience fevers, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches and fatigue. Left untreated this infection can cause chronic complications such as gangrene,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gangrene/symptoms-causes/syc-20352567|title=Gangrene – Symptoms and causes|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; meningitis, and even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plague/symptoms-causes/syc-20351291|title=Plague – Symptoms and causes|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bubonic plague outbreak in San Francisco's Chinatown strengthened anti-Chinese sentiment in all of California despite scientific research at the time showing it was caused by ''Yersinia pestis'', which was spread by fleas,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs267/en/|title=Plague|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in small rodents. When the first round of people died from this plague, the companies and the state denied the fact that there was an outbreak, in order to keep San Francisco's reputation and businesses in order. The plague did not derive from Chinatown; it was due to the unsanitary conditions and population density that outbreaks such as this one were spread quickly, and therefore affected a large number of people in this community.

The first deaths from the plague in San Francisco were in 1898; a French [[barque]] carried some passengers who had died of the plague. After its arrival in San Francisco, 18 more Chinatown residents died of the same symptoms. The mayor decided not to release a public warning of the outbreak, thinking it would negatively affect San Francisco's commercial business. Chinatown was quarantined, and sanitary services were suspended for some time until presence of bacteriological source was found. A sanitary campaign was launched; however many residents chose to avoid anything and everything that had to do with the plague out of fear and humiliation. As more and more deaths occurred, the city began being more aggressive, and they started checking nearly everyone in Chinatown for any signs of disease. Therefore, the Chinese community began to distrust the government even more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Risse|first1=Guenter B.|title=Plague, Fear, and Politics in San Francisco Chinatown|date=2012|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racism toward Chinese immigrants was socially accepted and social rights were oftentimes denied to this community. This fact made it harder for the community of Chinatown to seek medical attention for their illnesses during the plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LGL6_Z75y2gC&amp;pg=PP1|title=The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882|last=Soennichsen|first=John|date=2011-02-02|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37947-5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repeal and current status==
The Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed by the 1943 [[Magnuson Act]], during a time when China had become an ally of the U.S. against Japan in [[World War II]] as that the US needed to embody an image of fairness and justice. The Magnuson Act permitted Chinese nationals already residing in the country to become naturalized citizens and stop hiding from the threat of deportation. While the [[Magnuson Act]] overturned the discriminatory Chinese Exclusion Act, it only allowed a national quota of 105 Chinese immigrants per year, and did not repeal the restrictions on immigration from the other Asian countries. Large scale Chinese immigration did not occur until the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]]. The crackdown on Chinese immigrants reached a new level in its last decade, from 1956–1965, with the [[Chinese Confession Program]] launched by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]], that encouraged Chinese who had committed immigration fraud to confess, so as to be eligible for some leniency in treatment.

Despite the fact that the exclusion act was repealed in 1943, the law in California prohibiting non-whites from marrying whites was not struck down until 1948, in which the [[California Supreme Court]] ruled the ban of interracial marriage within the state unconstitutional in ''[[Perez v. Sharp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=283998 |author1=Chin, Gabriel |author2=Karthikeyan, Hrishi |year=2002 | journal=Asian Law Journal | volume=9 | title=Preserving Racial Identity: Population Patterns and the Application of Anti-Miscegenation Statutes to Asian Americans, 1910–1950 |publisher= Social Science Research Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Perez v. Sharp]]'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/32C2d711.htm 32 Cal. 2d 711] (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; Other states had such laws until 1967, when the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' that [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|anti-miscegenation laws across the nation]] are unconstitutional.

Even today, although all its constituent sections have long been repealed, Chapter 7 of [[Title 8 of the United States Code|Title 8]] of the [[United States Code]] is headed "Exclusion of Chinese".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/8/chapters/7/toc.html |title=US CODE-TITLE 8-ALIENS AND NATIONALITY |publisher=[[FindLaw]] |date= |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only chapter of the 15 chapters in Title 8 (Aliens and Nationality) that is completely focused on a specific nationality or ethnic group. Like the following Chapter 8, "The [[Cooly]] Trade", it consists entirely of statutes that are noted as "Repealed" or "Omitted".

On June 18, 2012, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed {{USBill|112|H.Res.|683}}, a resolution which had been introduced by Congresswoman [[Judy Chu]], that formally expresses the regret of the House of Representatives for the Chinese Exclusion Act, an act which imposed almost total restrictions on Chinese immigration and naturalization and denied Chinese-Americans basic freedoms because of their ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hres683|title=H.Res. 683 (112th)|accessdate=August 9, 2012|author=112th Congress (2012)|date=June 8, 2012 |work=Legislation
|publisher=GovTrack.us|quote=Expressing the regret of the House of Representatives for the passage of laws that adversely affected the Chinese in the United States, including the Chinese Exclusion Act.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{USBill|112|S.Res.|201}}, a similar resolution, had been approved by the [[U.S. Senate]] in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2012-06/19/content_15512469.htm "US apologizes for Chinese Exclusion Act"]. ''China Daily'', 19 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the California Legislature took formal action to pass measures that formally recognize the many proud accomplishments of Chinese-Americans in California and to call upon Congress to formally apologize for the 1882 adoption of the Chinese Exclusion Act. Senate Republican Leader Bob Huff (R-Diamond Bar) and incoming Senate President pro-Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) served as Joint Authors for Senate Joint Resolution (SJR) 23&lt;ref name=CA-SJR-23&gt;{{cite California statute |year=2014 |chapter=134 |page= |title=Senate Joint Resolution No. 23—Relative to Chinese Americans in California |ex= |res=true |HR= |quote=}}&amp;nbsp;[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SJR23 Direct URL]&lt;/ref&gt; and Senate Concurrent Resolution (SCR) 122,&lt;ref name=CA-SCR-122&gt;{{cite California statute |year=2014 |chapter=132 |page= |title=Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 122—Relative to Chinese Americans in California |ex= |res=true |HR= |quote=}}&amp;nbsp;[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SCR122 Direct URL]&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://huff.cssrc.us/content/legislature-recognizes-contributions-chinese-americans-apologizes-past-discriminatory-laws|title=Legislature Recognizes the Contributions of Chinese-Americans &amp; Apologizes for Past Discriminatory Laws |date= August 19, 2014 |publisher=California State Senate Republican Caucus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726085122/http://huff.cssrc.us/content/legislature-recognizes-contributions-chinese-americans-apologizes-past-discriminatory-laws |archivedate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both SJR 23 and SCR 122 acknowledge and celebrate the history and contributions of Chinese Americans in California.  The resolutions also formally call on Congress to apologize for laws which resulted in the persecution of Chinese Americans, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act.&lt;ref name=CA-SJR-23 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CA-SCR-122 /&gt;

Perhaps most important is the sociological implications for understanding ethnic/race relations in the context of American history: there is a tendency for minorities to be punished in times of economic, political and/or geopolitical crises. Times of social and systemic stability, however, tend to mute whatever underlying tensions exist between different groups. In times of societal crisis—whether perceived or real—patterns or retractability of American identities have erupted to the forefront of America's political landscape, often generating institutional and civil society backlash against workers from other nations, a pattern documented by Fong's research into how crises drastically alter social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fong|first1=Jack |date=April 2008 |title=American Social ‘Reminders’ of Citizenship after September 11, 2001: Nativisms in the Ethnocratic Retractability of American Identity |journal=Qualitative Sociology Review|volume=4|issue=1|pages=69–91 |url=http://www.qualitativesociologyreview.org/ENG/Volume9/QSR_4_1_Fong.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crimewatch''' is a television programme produced by the National Crime Prevention Council, Singapore and [[Singapore Police Force]]. Currently presented by serving regular [[police officer]]s, it showcases the work of the [[Singapore Police Force]] including solved cases, appeals for unsolved cases, as well as crime prevention advice.  It is based on the [[Germany|German]] programme [[Aktenzeichen XY... ungelöst]], or ''"File XY... Unsolved"''.

The programme is telecast monthly in four languages: Mandarin (''绳之以法''), English (''Crimewatch''), Tamil (''Kutra Kannkaanippu'') and Malay (''Jejak Jenayah'').  The English version was first shown in 1986, followed by Mandarin, then Malay in 2000 and Tamil in 2001. Starting March 2018, the new season of Crimewatch will be in Mandarin dubbed mainly followed by original English, Tamil dubbed and Malay dubbed.

The series was first telecast on 30 November 1986 and the Mandarin version debuted a week later. The episode featured the unsolved murder of a 19-year-old [[National Service|national serviceman]] and a public appeal from the victim's parents. Less than two weeks after the episode was broadcast, police were able to identify and arrest the suspects based on information provided by viewers responding to the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3 more held over NS man's murder|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19861207.2.27.23.aspx|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]|date=7 December 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;Episodes after 1993 are found on toggle.sg and only english and chinese version for crimewatch 1993-2008.

[[File:Dogging on a Leash Only.jpg|thumb|right|Vandalised "Dog On Leash Only" sign amended to refer to dogging, Kennington Park, London, 2012]]

'''Dogging''' is a [[British English]] slang term for engaging in [[public sex|sexual acts in a public]] or semi-public place or watching others doing so.&lt;ref name=pub&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Hardacre  |title=Here's the Pub, Church and Field for Public Sex |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=Puttenham Journal (column) |page=A10 |date=7 October 2010 |accessdate=8 October 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/world/europe/08puttenham.html?pagewanted=all |quote=Unhappily for many people here, it is also famous for being featured on lists of good places to go 'dogging'—that is, to have sex in public, sometimes with partners you have just met online, so that others can watch. So popular is the woodsy field below the ridge as a spot for gay sex (mostly during the day) and heterosexual sex (mostly at night) that the police have designated it a 'public sex environment.' …Public sex is a popular—and quasi-legal—activity in Britain, according to the authorities and to the large number of Web sites that promote it. (It is treated as a crime only if someone witnesses it, is offended and is willing to make a formal complaint.) And the police tend to tread lightly in public sex environments, in part because of the bitter legacy of the time when gay sex was illegal and closeted men having anonymous sex in places like public bathrooms were routinely arrested and humiliated.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be more than two participants; both [[group sex]] and [[gang bang]]ing can be included. As observation is encouraged, [[voyeurism]] and [[exhibitionism]] are closely associated with dogging. The two sets of people involved often meet either randomly or (increasingly) arrange to meet up beforehand over the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wear/7878889.stm |title='Dogging' hotspot to be policed |date=9 February 2009 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003 [[BBC News]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3119024.stm|title='Dogging' craze sex disease risk|date=8 September 2003|publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on the "new" dogging craze. They cited the Internet and [[text messaging]] as common ways of organising meetings. The original definition of dogging—and which is still a closely related activity—is spying on couples having sex in a car or other public place&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news| last=Kahney|first=Leander |title=Dogging Craze Has Brits in Heat |url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/03/62718?currentPage=all |newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=19 April 2004 |accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the term had been in use on Britain's railways for many years. It would have been well-known at least as far back as 1951&lt;ref name="Ian Allan Publishing 1996 p.

There is some evidence on the Internet that the "craze" has begun to spread to other countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvmidtvest.dk/indhold/masser-af-sex-paa-landsdelens-rastepladser |first=Kåre Rolf |last=Hansen |title=Masser af sex på landsdelens rastepladser |language=Danish |publisher=TV Midtvest |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621161445/http://www.tvmidtvest.dk/indhold/masser-af-sex-paa-landsdelens-rastepladser |archivedate=21 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands, Norway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray |first=Martin |title=Tenner på risikosex |work=[[Aftenposten]] |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |date=4 February 2007 |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1627552.ece |accessdate=20 August 2007 |quote=Fenomenet 'dogging' brer om seg og er i ferd med å få fotfeste i Norge. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715214635/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1627552.ece |archivedate=15 July 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uprawiają seks w centrum Warszawy |publisher=[[onet.pl]] |date=9 October 2007 |language=Polish |url=http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/1620190,11,item.html |accessdate=7 January 2014 |quote=Łazienki, park Szczęśliwicki i Skaryszewski to ulubione miejsca doggersów.

==Legality==
In Great Britain, dogging comes under laws related to [[voyeurism]], [[exhibitionism]], or [[Public sex|public displays of sexual behaviour]]; the laws on dogging are ambiguous. Prosecution is possible for a number of offences such as section 5 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/5 |title=Section 5 |work=''[[Public Order Act 1986]]'' |publisher=[[UK Statute Law Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[indecent exposure|exposure]] under section 66 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/66 |title=Section 66 |work=''[[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]'' |publisher=[[UK Statute Law Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for the common law offence of [[outraging public decency]]. {{As of|2010|post=,}} [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] (ACPO) policy was that arrests are a last resort and a more gradual approach should be taken in such circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lancashire/7674874.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Police leniency call on park sex |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries may also have laws regarding permitting, or being reckless as to whether, a [[minor (law)|minor]] watches or becomes exposed to sexual activities.

==Terminology==
The ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' of Scotland wrote in 2003, "The term dogging originated in the early 1970s to describe men who spied on couples having sex outdoors—these men would '[[wiktionary:dog#Verb|dog]]' the couples' every move and watch them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/36866 |work=[[Sunday Herald]] |location=Glasgow |title=Councils voice concern over new sex craze |first=Jen |last=Johnston |date=21 September 2003 |accessdate=28 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030922095216/http://www.sundayherald.com/36866 |archivedate=22 September 2003 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative etymology posits [[dog walking]] as the origin of the term; audience members, and indeed participants, could use the ordinary exercise of their pets as cover for their sexual assignations.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt;

'''Domestic violence in China''' involves violence or abuse by intimate partners or family members against one another. [[Intimate partner violence]] (IPV) by the man is the most common type of [[domestic violence]] in China: a 2005 ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'' report found that 1 out of 5 Chinese women had experienced physical violence from their partner in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = Xiao | last2 = Zhu | first2 = Fengchuan | last3 = O'Campo | first3 = Patricia | last4 = Koenig | first4 = Michael A. | last5 = Mock | first5 = Victoria | last6 = Campbell | first6 = Jacquelyn | year = 2005 | title = Prevalence of and Risk Factors for Intimate Partner Violence in China | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 95 | issue = 1| pages = 78–85 | pmc=1449856 | pmid=15623864 | doi=10.2105/AJPH.2003.023978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although China acknowledged that domestic violence was a problem in the 1930s,&lt;ref name="activism"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Milwertz | first1 = Cecilia | year = 2003 | title = Activism Against Domestic Violence in the People's Republic of China | url = http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/9/6/630.abstract | journal = Violence Against Women | volume = 9 | issue = 6| pages = 630–654 | doi=10.1177/1077801203009006002}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has only become a visible issue in the past few decades due to economic and social changes in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="tang"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 = Catherine So-Kum | last2 = Lai | first2 = Beatrice Pui-Yee | year = 2008 | title = A Review of Empirical Literature on the Prevalence and Risk Markers of Male-on-Female Intimate Partner Violence in Contemporary China, 1987–2006 | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 10–28 | doi = 10.1016/j.avb.2007.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic violence is legally defined in Article 2 of the Domestic Violence Law of 2015 as "physical, psychological or other infractions between family members effected through the use of methods such as beatings, restraints, maiming, restrictions on physical liberty as well as recurrent verbal abuse or intimidation."&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;[http://chinalawtranslate.com/反家庭暴力法-2015/?lang=en ''Domestic Violence Law of the People's Republic of China''], unofficial English translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the legal definition is confined to family members, domestic violence can also occur between unmarried, [[LGBT]], and other domestic couples.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leggett | first1 = Angela | year = 2016 | title = Online Civic Engagement and the Anti-Violence Movement in China: Shifting and Influencing Law | url = | journal = International Society for Third-Sector Research | volume =  | issue = | pages = 1–27 | doi = 10.1007/s11266-016-9680-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Traditional family dynamics===
Historically, Chinese families followed a hierarchical structure in which the husband had authority over most household decisions. This patriarchal ordering has its roots in [[Confucianism]], which establishes codes of conduct for women that typically place her below the husband.&lt;ref name="patriarchy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = Xiaohe | year = 1997 | title = The Prevalence and Determination of Wife Abuse in Urban China | journal = Journal of Comparative Family Studies | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 280–303 | jstor=41603520}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[Three Obediences and Four Virtues]] call for the wife to obey her father, husband, and son while maintaining a modest and moral lifestyle.&lt;ref name="patriarchy" /&gt; While Confucianism also advocates for social harmony and peace, beating one's wife was considered an appropriate way to discipline her.&lt;ref name="social"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Meng | last2 = Chan | first2 = Cecila | year = 1999 | title = Enduring Violence and Staying in Marriage: Stories of Battered Women in Rural China | url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=180042 | journal = Violence Against Women | volume = 5 | issue = 12| pages = 1469–1492 | doi=10.1177/10778019922183471}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the household was the man's domain, any violence he committed against his wife was generally seen as his family's private matter and subsequently disregarded.&lt;ref name="beating"&gt;Xu et al. 2005, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the hierarchical structure, the husband has traditionally been the main provider for the family while the wife has been the caretaker—this relationship was even apparent in the Chinese language, as one of the traditional characters for a woman (婦女, ''funu'') depicts a woman cleaning with a broom.&lt;ref name="social" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Lydia; Karl, Rebecca; Ko, Dorothy (12 March 2013). The Birth of Chinese Feminism: Essential Texts in Transnational Theory (pp. 114). New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Having only a "reproductive" role in the family, the wife was typically dependent on the husband and therefore unable to protest or leave when she was beaten.&lt;ref name="tang" /&gt; Moreover, the act of protesting against one's husband not only disrupted the social harmony of the family, but also demonstrated a lack of obedience and modesty—if a wife were to leave her husband, she would dishonor her family and provoke the disdain of the community.&lt;ref name="social" /&gt;

===Recent history===
[[File:All-China Women's Federation.svg|thumb|All-China Women's Federation]]
In the early 20th century, wife-beating was still a regularly occurring practice and deemed to be an acceptable tool to assert male dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmartin, C. (1990). Violence against women in contemporary China. In J. Lipman &amp; S. Harrell (Eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_7AyFeWAFcC Violence in China: Essays in culture and counterculture] (pp. 209). New York: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were organizations such as the [[All-China Women's Federation]] (ACWF) established by the [[Communist Party of China]], these state-established organizations did not exert much effort on domestic violence issues in the mid 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Milwertz 2003, p. 630&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1980s, a mixture of factors including China's increasing international presence, improved academic and employment opportunities for women, and a more open political climate led to strengthened efforts to address domestic violence and, in particular, violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;Tang et al. 2008, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; A large factor for this change was China's involvement in various [[United Nations]] conferences geared towards women and family issues in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Milwertz 2003, p. 636&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace]] hosted in China in 1995, in particular, allowed Chinese activists to come in contact with numerous international women's organizations and openly discuss the issue of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Lu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Lu|title=Domestic violence network in China: Translating the transnational concept of violence against women into local action|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=21 June 2009|volume=32|pages=227–239|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2009.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tang et al 2008, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, grassroots women's organizations such as the Women's Research Institute were being founded, breaking into a field of activism that only the ACWF historically occupied.&lt;ref name="Lu" /&gt;

As public awareness of the domestic violence issue grew, initial studies on domestic violence began to appear. Different studies by the ACWF, the Beijing Institute of Marriage and Family, the Population Research Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and other organizations reported rates from 1.6% of women to approximately a quarter of women that were beaten by their husbands at some point. As no studies were available to compare these numbers to prior to the 1980s, it was difficult to make qualitative assessments on the varying results; however, researchers were doubtful that these figures were an accurate representation of the scale of domestic violence in China.&lt;ref&gt;Milwertz 2003, p. 637&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic violence was first mentioned in the 1995 ''National Program for the Development of Women,'' which called for the prevention of domestic violence to be a large priority.&lt;ref name="law"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhao | first1 = Yuhong | year = 2000 | title = Domestic Violence in China: In Search of Legal and Social Responses | url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/58w796m0 | journal = UCLA Pacific Basin Law Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 211–251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was the first time in which domestic violence was explicitly mentioned, it had already been made implicitly illegal by various legal documents. The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], the [[General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China]], the Second Marriage Law of 1980, and the ''Law on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests'' all contain provisions that prohibit the abuse of women and family members in general.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt; Even though domestic violence had been implicitly and then officially illegal, in reality there were no mechanisms through which abused women could seek legal reparations in the 20th century.

===Marriage Law amendment in 2001===
The first form of legal defense for victims of domestic violence appeared in the 2001 amendment to the Second Marriage Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = He | first1 = Xin | last2 = Ng | first2 = Kwai Hang | year = 2013 | title = In the Name of Harmony: The Erasure of Domestic Violence in China's Judicial Mediation | url = | journal = International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 1–19 | doi = 10.1093/lawfam/ebs014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a judicial interpretation of the law, the [[Supreme People's Court]] legally defined domestic violence as "behavior towards a family member that results in injurious consequences physically, emotionally, or in other ways by 'beating, tying up, injuring, forcibly restricting one's personal freedom, or by other means.'"&lt;ref&gt;Wang, X. (2004). ‘Domestic violence’ in China in T. Jie, Z. Bijun and S. L. Mow (eds), Holding up Half the Sky: Chinese Women Past, Present, and Future, New York: Feminist Press at the City University of New York, 179–192.&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment included three important changes:
*Article 32(3)(2) holds that if mediation fails, divorce will be allowed if there are instances of family violence, maltreatment, or abandonment.
*Article 43 calls on the neighborhood committee or villagers committee to mediate cases of family violence, take measures to stop the violence, and impose administrative penalties on the offender.
*Article 46(3) and (4) grants the victim of domestic violence the right to claim compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xuejun | first1 = Zhang | year = 2002 | title = Amendment of the Marriage Law in China | url = | journal = International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 399–499 | doi = 10.1093/lawfam/16.3.399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2005 amendments to the ''Women's Protection Law'' affirmed the steps taken in the Marriage Law amendments. In particular, the amendments to the ''Women's Protection Law'' took it one step forward and explicitly stated in Article 46 that "Domestic violence against women is prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Palmer | first1 = Michael | year = 2007 | title = On China's Slow Boat to Women's Rights: Revisions to the Women's Protection Law, 2005 | url = | journal = The International Journal of Human Rights | volume = 11 | issue = 1–2| pages = 151–177 | doi = 10.1080/13642980601176316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic Violence Law of 2015===
In November 2014, Chinese legislators drafted China's first domestic violence law. The law was passed by Parliament in July 2015, and took effect on March 1, 2016.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatlow, Didi Kirsten (7 March 2016). [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/world/asia/china-feminists-women-domestic-violence.html?_r=0 "Year After Detentions, Chinese Feminists Mark Setbacks and Progress"]. The New York Times. retrieved 22 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The law reaffirms the advancements made in previous laws and offers a few novel provisions:
*Article 6 emphasizes the need for more publicity and education on the issue in schools and in the media.
*Article 19 calls for legal aid organizations to provide legal aid to victims of domestic violence and for courts to "delay, reduce, or waive litigation fees for victims of domestic violence in accordance with law."
*Article 21 empowers courts to revoke guardianship and appoint another guardian in cases of child abuse (and requires offenders to continue to provide financial support).
*Article 23 allows victims of domestic violence to apply for a personal safety protection order (the equivalent of a restraining order).
*Article 37 expands the law to cover domestic violence between persons who are not family members.&lt;ref name="modern" /&gt;

==Incidence==
While violence against women is the most common manifestation of domestic violence, it is not the only form. Domestic violence includes violence against any member within a household by a relative or partner. A 2004 survey by the ACWF found that 16% of families experiences male-on-female violence, whereas 30% of families had experienced domestic violence in general.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State. "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2006: China, (2007)". http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78771.htm (accessed on May 12, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
{{see also|Child abuse}}
With respect to children, domestic violence in China is a largely ignored issue due to the nebulous distinction between discipline and [[child abuse]]. Although a more common sentiment prior to the 1980s, the saying "beating is caring and scolding is intimacy" still holds traction for some families.&lt;ref name="beating" /&gt; A study of Hong Kong minors in May 1998 found that 52.9% of Chinese families experienced instances of minor violence (throwing objects, pushing, slapping) against children, and 46.1% of Chinese families experienced instances of severe violence (kicking, punching, threatening or beating with a weapon).&lt;ref&gt;Tang, Catherine So-kum (May 1998). "The Rate of Physical Child Abuse in Chinese Families: A Community Survey in Hong Kong" ''Child Abuse &amp; Neglect'' 22 (5): 381–391. dos:10.1016/S0145-2134(98)00010-6&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 survey by the China Law Society corroborated these results, finding that 71.9% of the 3543 people surveyed had been beaten by their parents when they were children.&lt;ref name="child"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qiao | first1 = D.P. | last2 = Chan | first2 = Y.C. | year = 2005 | title = Child Abuse in China: a Yet-to-Be-Acknowledged 'Social Problem' in the Chinese Mainland | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2206.2005.00347.x/abstract | journal = Child &amp; Family Social Work | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 21–27 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2206.2005.00347.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong study further found that children aged 3–6 were most likely to suffer from child abuse, and boys were more likely to suffer from severe violence by their parents than girls. The likelihood of physical abuse also increased if a child had no siblings. These trends largely reflect the interconnected relationship between abuse and discipline in Chinese families—parents generally see sons and single children as the future of the household and are consequently more strict with their upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;Tang 1998, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its prevalence, child abuse is taken relatively lightly in the Chinese legal system. In 1998, child maltreatment cases comprised 0.29% of all cases for the people's court in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Qiao et al. 2005, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender differences===
{{see also|Domestic violence against men}}
A 2004 International Family Planning Perspectives survey found that, including mutual violence, 34% of respondents had experienced male-on-female violence and 18% had experienced female-on-male violence. In addition, 12% of women and 5% of men reported suffering severe violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parish | first1 = William L. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2004 | title = Intimate Partner Violence in China: National Prevalence, Risk Factors and Associated Health Problems | url = | journal = International Family Planning Perspectives | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 174–181 | pmid = 15590383 | doi=10.1363/ifpp.30.174.04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 meta-study of various studies on IPV, 19.7% of women were found to have experienced violence by their male partners at some point, while 16.8% of women experienced violence in the past year. Similarly, approximately 10% of women had experienced sexual violence at some point in their life, while 5.4% of women experienced sexual violence in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;Tang et al. 2008, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Men are also more likely than women to acknowledge that the wife had suffered violence in their relationship, which attests to the general underreporting phenomenon with male-on-female violence.&lt;ref name="Parish"&gt;Parish et al. 2004, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic violence also increased with sexual jealousy, with male-on-female violence becoming more likely if the woman was jealous and mutual hitting more likely if the man was jealous.&lt;ref name="Parish" /&gt;

===Regional differences===
Compared to the 15% of women in urban settings, 28.3% of women in rural settings reported violence by a male partner. Moreover, while younger age increased the likelihood of abuse for women in urban settings, greater age was found to correlate with the likelihood of abuse for women in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Tang et al. 2008, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic violence was also found to be more likely in central areas and the North than in the South, with rates of 22%, 14%, and 11% respectively. Female-on-male violence was found to be more prominent in the North than in other areas.&lt;ref name="Parish" /&gt;

'''Ethiopian Semitic''' (also known as '''Ethiosemitic''', '''Ethiopic''' and '''Abyssinian'''&lt;ref name=Z2-5&gt;Igor Mikhailovich Diakonov [https://books.google.com.et/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=hHoOAAAAYAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Abyssinian+languages%22 Semito-Hamitic Languages: An Essay in Classification - Google Books"]: Nauka, Central Department of Oriental Literature, (1965) pp 12&lt;/ref&gt;) is a group of languages spoken in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], with a small population of [[Tigre language|Tigre]] speakers in [[Sudan]]. Together with the [[Razihi language]] of [[Old South Arabian]], they form the '''Western South Semitic languages''', which, together with [[Modern South Arabian]], the Eastern branch, they form the [[South Semitic languages|South Semitic]] sub-branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family's [[Semitic languages]] branch.

[[Amharic]], the official working language in Ethiopia, has ~62 million speakers (including second language speakers) and is the most widely spoken in the group. [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] has 7 million speakers and is the most widely spoken language in Eritrea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woldemikael|first1=Tekle M.|title=Language, Education, and Public Policy in Eritrea|journal=African Studies Review|date=April  2003|volume=46|issue=1|pages=117–136|doi=10.2307/1514983|jstor=1514983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://llacan.vjf.cnrs.fr/PDF/Publications/Senelle/DahlikBilan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  

While focused on Semitic languages as the only branch of the broader [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family that is distributed outside Africa, a recent study by Kitchen ''et al.''  proposed through the use of [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] computational phylogenetic techniques that "contemporary Ethiosemitic languages of Africa reflect a single introduction of early Ethiosemitic from southern Arabia approximately 2800 years ago", and that this single introduction of Ethiosemitic underwent "rapid diversification" within Ethiopia and Eritrea.&lt;ref name="Semitic Bayesian"&gt;[http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1668/2703.abstract] Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of Semitic languages identifies an Early Bronze Age origin of Semitic in the Near East.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ethiopian Semitic languages all share [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV) [[word order]] as part of the [[Ethiopian language area]].

The division into Northern and Southern branches was established by Cohen (1931) and Hetzron (1972) and garnered broad acceptance, but this classification has recently&lt;!-- The most recent work in Voigt's bibliography is 2007, but when did Voigt publish? ~Hijiri88, June 2016. --&gt; been challenged by Dr. Rainer Voigt.&lt;ref&gt;https://es.scribd.com/mobile/document/305117272/Rainer-Voigt-North-vs-South-Ethiopian-Semitic&lt;/ref&gt; Voigt rejects the classification that was put forward by Cohen and Hetzron, concluding that they are too closely related to be grouped separately into a north and south.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.svt.ntnu.no/sites/ices16/Proceedings/Volume%204/Rainer%20Voigt%20-%20North%20vs.%20South%20Ethiopian%20Semitic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
Many Filipino people entered Pakistan's commercial center [[Karachi]] illegally with fake passports and false identity cards as early in 1990s along with hundreds of [[Nepal]]i, Bengals,  [[Sri Lankans]] and [[India]]ns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?200305|title=Homeless In Karachi|last=Owais Tohid, Arshad Mahmud |date=November 1995|publisher=Outlook India|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however later deported. As of April 2010, there are 546 registered Filipino living in Pakistan who were eligible to vote in [[2010 Philippine presidential election]] as per Philippines Foreign Affairs ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dfa.gov.ph/main/index.php/news-from-rp-embassies/972-philippine-embassy-in-islamabad-begins-overseas-absentee-polls|title=Philippine Embassy in Islamabad Begins Overseas Absentee Polls|date=April 10, 2010|publisher=MoFA|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment ==
Many Filipinos in Pakistan are domestic workers, including the housemaids of high government officials and rich Pakistanis. There are some three Filipino maids at house of former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Pakistani Prime Minister]] [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] and many Filipinos working as chefs in Japanese restaurants in [[Karachi]]&lt;ref name="BusinessMirror"/&gt; and [[Islamabad]]. 
A small number of Filipinos studying [[Islam]] in the country is reported by the Philippines Embassy in Islamabad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dante|date=June 6, 2008|title=Why Pakistan matters to the Philippines |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/june/06/yehey/opinion/20080606opi7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while thousands of Muslim students from various Southeast Asian countries including Philippines illegally studying in the Pakistani [[Madrasah]]s.  Some Filipinos are also [[Nursing in Pakistan|nurses in Pakistan]].

== Relations with Pakistani society ==
In 2007, following a state of emergency declared by Pakistani President [[Pervez Musharraf]], about 200 Filipinos gathered in Islamabad on the advice of Ambassador Jimmy Yambao to call for protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20071105-98873/Arroyo_orders_tight_security_for_Filipinos_in_Pakistan|title=Arroyo orders tight security for Filipinos in Pakistan|first= Lira Dalangin-Fernandez, Veronica Uy|publisher=Agence France-Presse|accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have no direct threats to safety of Filipinos in Pakistan reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/video/13805/no-direct-threats-to-pinoys-in-pakistan-dfa-assures|title=No direct threats to Pinoys in Pakistan, DFA assures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gay cruising''' describes the act of searching about a [[public place]] in pursuit of a partner for sex. The activity has existed in England and Wales since at least the 17th century and has a colourful legal history. It differs from [[prostitution]] in that the parties involved do not seek money for sex, and from gay [[nightclubs]] or [[Gay bathhouse|bathhouses]] in that they are not on private premises, although they may take place on private land to which the public have been granted access.

==History and origins==
The history of gay [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] is sparsely documented, as the illegality of gay sex meant that those who used such cruising grounds were likely to be discreet about them. [[Rictor Norton]], author of ''Mother Clap's Molly House'' (a reference to [[Margaret Clap]]), is one of the few historians to address the topic. He believes that the first gay cruising grounds and [[Molly house|gay brothels]] in [[London]] may have sprung up in the early 17th century; [[theatre]]s were sometimes denounced as such by moralists of the time.

So-called "cruising grounds" or "cruising sites", where gay and bisexual men meet at a public place to cruise for sex, originated in the late 1600s (from the earliest known records, although it most likely originated much earlier) and has continued to the present day. Cruising came about owing to the illegality of homosexual acts in the [[United Kingdom]]. Prior to the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]], this illegality meant that many gay men could not live openly as homosexuals. Cruising provided a way for gay men to solicit sexual encounters while minimizing the risk of being caught by the police. When cruising first became known, it usually took place in public fields, parks, toilets (or "[[Cottaging|cottages]]" as they would become known as in the 20th century). In more recent times, public [[Rest area#Lay-bys|lay-bys]] located either on or off main roads or rural roads have also become popular sites.

===Legal history===
Before the 20th century, [[anal sex]], whether conducted in public or private, was illegal under [[sodomy law]]s, including the [[Buggery Act]] set down by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1533. The penalty for anal intercourse during most of this period was death; however, specific proof of successful anal penetration was required for this verdict to be brought. The lesser crime of "gross indecency" carried penalties including the [[pillory]] (as in the case of the [[Vere Street Coterie]], who were arrested in a raid of a gay club in 1811), transportation and imprisonment.

The death penalty for anal sex was lifted in 1861.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2004&gt;{{citation |last=Hawkes |first=Gail |year=2004 |title=Sex and pleasure in western culture |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0-7456-1671-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hdn9i6FJs3UC |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 1885 law prohibited "gross indecency", which included all erotic conduct between men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sodom on the Thames: sex, love, and scandal in Wilde times |first=Morris B. |last=Kaplan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJZw1_WiZI8C&amp;pg=PA187 |page=187|year=2005 |publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in 1967, some of the [[Wolfenden Report]]'s recommendations of a decade earlier led to the decriminalisation of homosexual sex in private; no such legal privilege pertains to sex in public places, either for homosexual or heterosexual sex.&lt;ref name=GreatBritain1963&gt;{{citation |author1=Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution |year=1963 |title=The Wolfenden report: report of the Committee on Homosexual Offenses and Prostitution |publisher=Stein and Day |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x601AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moran1996&gt;{{citation |last=Moran |first=Leslie J. |year=1996 |title=The homosexual(ity) of law |edition=annotated |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-07952-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-G8O95Yk2wC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, despite more tolerance in the law and society at large, gay men have continued to be at risk of prosecution for public sex. 

A number of well known people have been arrested for sex in public places in England and Wales, including:

The playwright [[Joe Orton]] wrote in his posthumously published diaries of his regular cottaging, but he did not incur prosecution.

===Areas with a history of gay cruising===
{{harvtxt|Norton|2007}} lists a number of London cruising grounds during the [[Georgian era]]. These included [[St. James's Park]], [[Moorfields]], the public [[outhouse|privies]] at [[Lincoln's Inn]], and [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] prior to the [[Gordon Riots]].

[[Hampstead Heath]] in north London has a long history of gay cruising, which was accompanied by police arrests and attacks. From the late 1990s, this evolved into minimal active policing, and support from gay sexual health organisations.&lt;ref name=Howard2006&gt;{{cite news |title=Personal Column: 'I go with gay strangers.

Night and day, but especially night, there's the cackle of mating calls, beating-off around the bushes and a constant stream of furtive trade riding through the glen, occasionally stopping, the little Tinkerbells – so residents claim – to light a fire and verbally abuse those vicious homophobes who have the nerve to object.

[[Clapham Common]] in south London is well-known for gay cruising. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Ron Davies (Welsh politician)|Ron Davies]] resigned from the government after national newspapers reported that he was attacked and robbed by a man whom he met on the Common. A number of homophobic attacks have occurred around the area, including the [[murder of Jody Dobrowski]].&lt;ref name=Milmo2005&gt;{{cite news |title=Murder in park was latest in spate of anti-gay attacks |last=Milmo |first=Cahal |date=18 October 2005 |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/murder-in-park-was-latest-in-spate-of-antigay-attacks-511391.html |quote=As he made his way home from visiting a friend, Mr Dobrowski was kicked and punched to death on the edge of a well-known gay cruising area on Clapham Common.

They are all in some way compromised by their sexuality: they go to Hampstead Heath, Clapham Common and public lavatories for sex.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation==
The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] prohibits all forms of sexual activity in a public lavatory, but has nothing to say about other forms of cruising. However, persons of any gender who engage in sexual intercourse in public can find themselves charged with offences under the [[Public Order Act 1986]], if the police have sufficient evidence to convince a court of law that the activity was witnessed by a third party, or there was a high likelihood of the activity being witnessed by a third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COTTAGING AND CRUISING: YOUR SAFETY, YOUR RIGHTS AND THE LAW|url=http://www.galop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/cottaging-and-cruising-a4.pdf|publisher=Galop.org.uk|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bindel|first1=Julie|title=The tricky business of policing sex in public|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29205198|work=BBC News|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, there is an active population of men who visit cruising grounds, which include parks, picnic areas and lay-bys where sex takes place in the bushes or other sheltered areas. These areas exist in all parts of Britain, including isolated rural areas. The attitude of the police to cruising at any given location varies, according to the time of the day or night, and the level of public concern measured by the number of complaints from local residents and councillors. Occasionally, [[police community support officer]]s will visit a cruising area during the early hours of the morning with the intention of advising cruisers of the risk of homophobic attacks, and any persons seen to be involved in sexual behavior will be asked to move on rather than being arrested. A number of police forces actively participate in on-line discussions with cruisers in order to gather information on hate crimes and to discourage them from using locations about which complaints have been received.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.gaybod.com/discus/messages/48464/48464.html] {{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current trend for gay cruising has been bolstered by a continued use of online media. Apps and websites including [[Grindr]], Cruizerz.com and [[Squirt.org]] make arranged cruising possible, although this has been a source of questionable safety, with Russian gangs having been found to use such media to lure gay men into dangerous situations.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8495">'''Global apartheid''' is a term used to mean [[minority rule]] in international decision-making. The term comes from [[apartheid]], the system of governmental that ruled [[South Africa]] until 27 April 1994 when people of all races were able to vote as equals for the first time.

The concept of global apartheid has been developed by many researchers, including [[Titus Alexander]], [[Bruno Amoroso]], [[Patrick Bond]], [[Gernot Kohler]], [[Arjun Makhijiani]], [[Ali Mazuri]], [[Vandana Shiva]], Anthony H. Richmond, [[Joseph Nevins]], [[Muhammed Asadi]], [[Gustav Fridolin]], and many others.&lt;ref name="TitusAlexander"&gt;Titus Alexander, Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics, Polity Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Amoroso, Global Apartheid.

== Origin and use ==
The first use of the term may have been by Gernot Koehler in a 1978 Working Paper for the [[World Order Models Project]].  In 1995 Koehler develop this in ''The Three Meanings of Global Apartheid: Empirical, Normative, Existential''.&lt;ref&gt;Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, Vol. 20, No. 3 (July-September 1995), pp. 403-413&lt;/ref&gt;

Its best known use was by [[Thabo Mbeki]], then-President of South Africa, in a 2002 speech, drawing comparisons of the status of the world's people, economy, and access to natural resources to the apartheid era.&lt;ref&gt;Haviland, William (1993). Cultural Anthropology. Vermont: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers. p. 250-252&lt;/ref&gt;  Mbeki got the term from Titus Alexander, initiator of [[Charter 99]], a campaign for [[democratic mundialization|global democracy]], who was also present at the UN [[Millennium Summit]] and gave him a copy of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid''.

== Concept ==
Minority rule in global governance is based on national sovereignty rather than racial identity, but in many other respects the history and structures of apartheid South Africa can be seen as a microcosm of the world. Following the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Second World War, the United States and United Kingdom used their political power to create systems of economic management and protection to mitigate the worst effects of free trade and neutralise the competing appeals of communism and national socialism. In South Africa ''civilized labour'' policies restricted public employment to whites, reserved skilled jobs for whites and controlled the movement of non-whites through a system of pass laws. In the West, escalating tariff barriers reserved manufacturing work for Europeans and Americans while immigration laws controlled the movement of immigrants seeking work.

At a political level, the West still dominates global decision-making through minority control of the central banking system ([[Bank of International Settlements]]), [[IMF]], [[World Bank]], [[Security Council]] and other institutions of global governance.  The [[G8]] represent less than 15% of world population, yet have over 60% of its income.  80% of the permanent members of the UN Security Council represent white Western states, 60% from Europe. The West has veto power in the World Bank, IMF and [[WTO]] and regulates global monetary policy through the Bank of International Settlements (BIS).  By tradition, the head of the World Bank is always a US citizen, nominated by the US President, and the IMF is a European.  Although the rest of the world now has a majority in many international institutions, it does not have the political power to reject decisions by the Western minority.

In ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'', [[Samuel P. Huntington]] describes how "the United States together with Britain and France make the crucial decisions on political and security issues; the United States together with Germany and Japan make the crucial decisions on economic issues."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P Huntington The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, (p81)&lt;/ref&gt;  Huntington quoted Jeffrey R Bennett to claim that Western nations:&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey R Bennett ‘Exclusion as National Security Policy’, Parameters, 24, Spring 1994, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

* own and operate the international banking system
* control all hard currencies
* are the world’s principle customer
* provide the majority of the world’s finished goods
* dominate international capital markets
* exert considerable moral leadership within many societies
* are capable of massive military intervention
* control the sea lanes

Huntington presents a ‘framework, a paradigm, for viewing global politics’ to protect “Western civilization”. He argues that other civilizations threaten the West through immigration, cultural differences, growing economic strength and potential military power. ‘If North America and Europe renew their moral life, build on their cultural commonality, and develop close forms of economic and political integration to supplement their security collaboration in NATO, they could generate a third Euroamerican phase of Western affluence and political influence. Meaningful political integration would in some measure counter the relative decline in the West’s share of the world’s people, economic product, and military capabilities and revive the power of the West in the eyes of the leaders of other civilizations.’ However, this ‘depends overwhelmingly on whether the United States reaffirms its identity as a Western nation and defines its global role as the leader of Western civilization.’ [p308]

Alexander identifies numerous ''pillars of global apartheid'' including:&lt;ref name="TitusAlexander" /&gt;
*veto power by the Western minority in the UN [[Security Council]] 
*voting powers in the [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]]
*dominance of the [[World Trade Organization]] through effective veto power and ‘weight of trade’ rather than formal voting power
*one-sided rules of trade, which give privileged protection to Western agriculture and other interests while opening markets in the Majority World
*protection of ‘hard currency’ through the central banking system through the [[Bank of International Settlements]] 
*immigration controls which manage the flow of labour to meet the needs of Western economies 
*use of aid and investment to control elites in the Majority World through reward and punishment 
*support for coups or military intervention in countries which defy Western dominance

International decision-making has a legacy of [[international inequality|inequality]] which some authors{{Who|date=September 2015}} have compared to historical [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].

'''Gogo''' is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] spoken by the [[Gogo (ethnic group)|Gogo people]] of [[Dodoma Region]] in [[Tanzania]]. The language is spoken throughout Dodoma Region and into the neighbouring district of [[Manyoni]].

The language is considered to have three [[dialect]]s: Nyambwa (Cinyambwa or West Gogo), spoken to the west of Dodoma and in Manyoni, Nyaugogo (Cinyaugogo or Central Gogo), spoken in the environs of Dodoma and Tumba (Citumba or East Gogo), spoken to the east. The Gogo group is grouped with [[Kagulu language|Kagulu]], which has a 56% [[lexical similarity]] with Gogo proper, which leads some{{Who|date=July 2009}} to classify Kagulu as a Gogo dialect. Gogo has about 50% lexical similarity with [[Hehe language|Hehe]] and [[Kisangu language|Sangu]] (both [[Bena–Kinga languages]] (G.60), 48% with [[Kimbu language|Kimbu]] and 45% with [[Nilamba language|Nilamba]]. These last two are both in Guthrie's [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages#Zone F|Zone F]].

Gogo is spoken by both [[Christian]]s and [[Muslim]]s and is a major language of the [[Anglican Church of Tanzania]].

The '''Gorals''' ({{lang-pl|Górale}}; {{lang-sk|Gorali}}; [[Cieszyn Silesia dialect|Cieszyn Silesian]]: ''Gorole''; literally "highlanders") are an ethnographic (or ethnic) group primarily found in their traditional area of southern [[Poland]], northern [[Slovakia]], and in the region of [[Cieszyn Silesia]] in the [[Czech Republic]] ([[Silesian Gorals]]). There is also a significant Goral diaspora in the area of [[Bukovina]] in western [[Ukraine]] and in northern [[Romania]], as well as in [[Chicago]], the seat of the [[Polish Highlanders Alliance of North America]].

In [[Poland]], the community inhabits the geographical region of [[Podhale]] of the [[Tatra Mountains]] and parts of the [[Beskids]] ([[Cieszyn Silesia]], [[Silesian Beskids]], [[Żywiec Beskids]]). In present-day [[Slovakia]] they live in 4 separate groups: in northern [[Spiš]] (34 villages subdivided in two groups), [[Orava (region)|Orava]] and [[Kysuce]] (2 villages) and smaller groups in 7 other enclave villages in northern Slovakia.

The main settlements of Gorals include:
*[[Zakopane]]
*[[Poronin]]
*[[Murzasichle]]
*[[Zawoja]]

==Language==
The West Slavic, Polish dialects spoken by the Gorals share many linguistic features with neighboring [[East Slavic languages]] spoken by other Carpathian highlanders, especially the [[Rusyn language]] spoken by the [[Hutsuls]], [[Lemkos]], and [[Boykos]]. 

The various dialects spoken by the Gorals descend from [[Proto-Slavic]] from the Eastern [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic]], Old [[Polish language|Polish]] area, superimposed by [[Slovak language|Slovak]]. In other words, the language, called the '''Podhale dialect''' ({{lang-pl|gwara podhalańska}}), is of Polish origin, but has been influenced by Slovak&lt;ref name="Wijk1931"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicolaas van Wijk|title=Czechoslovakia: facts and impressions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5z0GAQAAIAAJ|year=1931|publisher=Orbis|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; in recent centuries. In addition to Polish, the language contains some vocabulary of other origins, including Slovak, [[Eastern Romance]], and words of uncertain origin that have cognates in other languages of the Carpathian region.

[[Jabłonkowanie]], a phonological feature similar to [[mazurzenie]], occurs in some Silesian dialects. 14th- and 15th-century palatal consonant pronunciation (called "Podhale archaisms") features are preserved in the Podhale dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Slavic and East European Review|volume=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4AASAAAAIAAJ|year=1950|publisher=a committee of American scholars|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; K. Dobroslowski asserted that the Podhale dialect had loan-words from Romanian and Albanian (1938), as well as similar belief system elements, music and material culture.&lt;ref name="BertrandKarsenty1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alain Bertrand, Alain Karsenty, Antonio Carlos Santana Diegues, Arild Angelsen, Berry Lekanne dit Deprez, Brent M.

==Anthropology==

The Gorals and other West Slavic peoples of the Carpathians show little northern, Germanic, influence, as opposed to other regions of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman John Greville Pounds|title=Eastern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zxpAAAAMAAJ|year=1969|publisher=Aldine Pub. Co.|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carleton S. Coon]] grouped the Gorals with the [[Hutsuls]] in the southeastern corner of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (now [[Ukraine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=carleton stevens coon|title=the races of europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bAxWFb6m9QC|year=1939|page=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Polish scholars viewed the Gorals as linguistically close to the Poles, but having close ties with Slovak folk culture.&lt;ref name="Cornis-PopeNeubauer2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marcel Cornis-Pope|author2=John Neubauer|title=History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Types and stereotypes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YINYl4iv4ecC&amp;pg=PA445|year=2010|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-3458-2|pages=445–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted that Gorals' social and economic life resembled that of Vlach shepherd culture.&lt;ref name="Cornis-PopeNeubauer2010"/&gt;

In a wider sense '''Gorals''' refers to an ethnographic (or even ethnic) group comprising certain highlanders in the northern [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], more precisely these ethnic groups:
* Gorals
** Żywiec Gorals (autonym: ''żywczaki'', pl: ''górale żywieccy''), of [[Żywiec Basin]] in Poland
** [[Silesian Gorals]] (autonym: ''gorole'', pl: górale śląscy, cz: slezští goralé) of [[Cieszyn Silesia]] in Poland and Czech Republic
** Podhale Gorals (pl: ''górale podhalańscy'') of [[Podhale]] in Poland
* [[Hutsuls]] (ukr: ''hutsuly'') of [[Bukovina]] and [[Maramureş]] in Ukraine and Romania
* [[Lemko]]s (ukr: ''lemki'', pl: ''łemkowie'') of [[Lemkivshchyna]] in Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine
* [[Boykos]] (ukr: ''boyki'', pl: ''bojkowie''), in Ukraine, Poland, Slovakia
* Moravian Vlachs in [[Moravian Wallachia]], Czech Republic

==National identity==
[[File:"A Goral Wedding" at Dom Ludowy Theatre.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Gorals of [[Podhale]], [[Zakopane]] area]]

For most Gorals today, the decisive factor in their self-identification with a nationality is not ethnic but territorial. For example, those living in areas under a long tradition of belonging to the Polish state identify themselves as Polish, while those living in Slovakia have identified themselves as Slovaks, with notable exceptions to this rule on both sides of the border. While the origin of the Goral dialect is Polish,&lt;ref name="Hannan-Krissakova"&gt;For a better idea of the issue see either [[Kevin Hannan]]'s work ''Borders of Language and Identity in Teschen Silesia'' or works by the Slovak linguist [[Júlia Dudášová-Kriššáková]], ''Goralské nárečia'', {{ISBN|80-224-0354-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the language of Gorals in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic is gradually shifting and increasingly becoming more similar to the literary standard in their respective countries. [[Silesian Gorals]] of the Czech Republic identify themselves on the nationality level as Poles and are members of the [[Polish minority in Zaolzie]], which is proved by their communal activity – annual [[Gorolski Święto]] festival held in [[Jablunkov]] (Jabłonków) is a showcase of a local Polish Goral traditions and is organized by the [[PZKO]] (Polish Cultural and Educational Union). This Goral festival preserves the traditions of the Polish nationality group in Zaolzie.&lt;ref name="gorolskiswieto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorolskiswieto.cz/en.html|publisher=gorolskiswieto.cz|title=History of Gorolski Święto for foreign visitors|accessdate=April 10, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706080330/http://www.gorolskiswieto.cz/en.html|archivedate=July 6, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest cultural and folklore festival in [[Zaolzie]] area gathering thousands of spectators each day of festivities.

However, in none of the towns and villages of the area the [[Polish minority in Zaolzie|Poles]] form a majority and some local Gorals identify themselves on the nationality level as Czechs. In this respect the village of [[Hrčava]] (the second easternmost village in the Czech Republic), with vast majority of citizens declaring Czech nationality, can be mentioned. In this village the Poles form only a 2% minority.&lt;ref name="czso"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.czso.cz/sldb/sldb2001.nsf/obce/598232?OpenDocument|publisher=czso.cz|title=Czech Statistical Office (2001 census)|accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local Gorals formed (as indigenous people) a majority in the past. They speak the [[Cieszyn Silesia dialect|regional dialect]] in everyday communication.

Historically, the issue of their ethnic identity has been controversial and resulted in claims and counterclaims by both [[Poland]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. Gorals, like many other peasant communities in [[Central Europe]], determined their own ethnic identities within the nation state system during the 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hannan, Kevin (1996). Borders of Language and Identity in Teschen Silesia. New York: Peter Lang. {{ISBN|0-8204-3365-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; American anthropologists termed the Gorals "Black Russians", while noting that the western Gorals spoke Polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=United States. Immigration Commission (1907–1910)|author2=William Paul Dillingham|title=Reports of the Immigration Commission|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24M-AQAAMAAJ|year=1911|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although nationalist [[propaganda]] was generated by both Poles and Slovaks, this process of the Gorals' identification with a nationality was still not complete when the border was finalized in 1924. A notable example were Ferdynand Machay, a [[priest]] born in [[Jabłonka, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Jabłonka]], [[Orava (region)|Orava]], Piotr Borowy from [[Rabča]], [[Orava (region)|Orava]] and Wojciech Halczyn from [[Lendak]], [[Spiš]], who went to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] and, during a personal audience, lobbied [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] to sign these lands over to [[Poland]].

The [[Zakopane Style architecture]], established at the end of the 19th century, is held as a Goral tradition. The architectural style draws on local architecture and [[Vernacular architecture of the Carpathians]], and is widespread in the [[Podhale]] region.

===Folk costume===

==== Clasps ====
For centuries clasps have been an important element of Polish highlanders’ traditional costumes. Originally used for fastening shirts, they fell out of use when buttons became popular, remaining only as ornaments. In the early 20th century they were already rare, used only by senior and young shepherds, who grazed their sheep on mountain pastures. In the 1920s and the 1930s they were considered collector's items and sought after by tourists. In [[Zakopane]] they were often worn as ornaments for the "cucha" (outerwear), sweaters or occasionally on leather bags. Today the clasps are a popular element of highlanders from the [[Podhale]] region, but the way they are worn differs from the original one: instead of fastening shirts they are usually attached to them or sewed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poland: Travel Guide|last=Uszyńska|first=Zofia|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|year=1960|isbn=|volume=vol. 1|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Parzenica'' (embroidery) ====
The [[parzenica]] embroidery dates back to the mid-19th century. Initially they were simple string loops, used for reinforcing cuts in front of cloth trousers. They had practical functions and protected the cloth from fraying. The modern look ''parzenica'' got from those tailors who began using red or navy blue string, simultaneously increasing the number of loops. Later the appliqué design was replaced with [[embroidery]]. Using woollen yarn allowed the parzenica to become more colourful and eventually it become a stand-alone trouser ornamentation, developed by talented tailors and embroiderers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Folk art in Poland|last=Pietraszkowa-Fryś|first=Ewa|last2=Pokropek|first2=Marian|last3=Kunczyńska-Iracka|first3=Anna|publisher=Arkady|year=1991|isbn=9788321334783|location=|pages=80|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Corsets ====
In the second half of the 19th century it became fashionable in the [[Podhale]] region to adorn [[corset]]s with depictions of thistle and edelweiss. These motifs were the most popular in the early 20th century. When "[[Kraków]] style" came into fashion, highlanders of the Podhale region began ornamenting the corsets with shiny sequins and glass beads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Polish Folk Art|last=Pietkiewicz|first=Kazimierz|publisher=Polonia Publishing House|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other ====
In [[Cieszyn Silesia]] and northern Slovakia, the [[Shepherd's axe]] and elements of the folk costume are termed ''Vlach'' ({{lang-pl|wałaska, wałaszczaki}}, {{lang-sk|valaška}}).&lt;ref name="Hannan1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Hannan|title=Borders of Language and Identity in Teschen Silesia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pdFiAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-0-8204-3365-3|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlanders Costumes in their collections have the following museums, e.g.: [[National Museum of Ethnography|The National Museum of Ethnography in Warsaw]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Czas świętowania w kulturach Polski i Europy|last=|first=|publisher=The State Ethnographic Museum in Warsaw|year=2013|isbn=978-83-88654-42-8|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ordinary - extraordinary : fascinating collections of The State Ethnographical Museum in Warsaw|last=Bartuszek|first=Joanna and others|publisher=The State Ethnographic Museum in Warsaw|year=2008|isbn=978-83-88654-76-3 |editor-last=Czyżewski|editor-first=Adam|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Tatra Museum in Zakopane]], the [[Ethnographic Museum of Kraków]], the [[City Museum of Żywiec]]

===Religion===
Gorals are adherents of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and are often noted for their staunch religiosity.

The [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Ludźmierz]] is of particular importance to the Gorals, being the oldest monument in the Podhale region. There are numerous cults connected to the church.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2545">A '''green annual report''' is an [[annual report]] on a company's financial status that is printed using production processes that save energy, trees, water, and also reduce waste and [[greenhouse gases]]. According to a 2005 survey that studied trends in annual reporting, the average number of pages in an annual report was 65, and the number of copies produced averaged between more than 5,000 to less than 50,000. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciri.org/media/uploads/attachment1136818437.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Green annual reports are frequently printed using eco-friendly [[soy ink]]s. In comparison with traditional petroleum-based ink, soy inks are [[environmentally friendlier]], are available in brighter colors, and make it easier to [[recycling|recycle]] paper. Petroleum-based inks contain 30-35% [[Volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs), while soybean oil-based inks typically range from only 0-5% VOCs. New processes also had to be developed to make the de-inking and recycling of paper easier, and soy-based inks perform better in conjunction with modern de-inking procedures. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.recycledproducts.com/index.php?cid=25 &lt;/ref&gt; Green annual reports are also frequently printed on FSC ([[Forest Stewardship Council]]) Certified Printers. The FSC is an independent, non-governmental, not-for-profit organization established to promote the responsible management of the world’s forests. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.fsc.org/about-fsc.html?&amp;L=t%A8arget%3D_self&lt;/ref&gt; On February 17 2009, the WWF ([[World Wildlife Fund]]) announced that they were reaffirming the FSC as still the best environmentally responsible certification scheme for business.

An eco audit statement is placed in the final document that estimates the number of trees preserved, pounds of water-borne waste that was not created, number of gallons of waste-water flow saved, pounds of solid waste not generated, net pounds of greenhouse gases prevented and the amount of energy in million [[BTU]]s not consumed. An eco audit is "a management tool comprising a systematic, documented, periodic, and objective evaluation of how well environmental organization, management and equipment are performing with the aim of contributing to safeguarding the environment by: facilitating management control of environmental practices and assessing compliance with company policies, which would include meeting regulatory requirements." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/ec/eco-audit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indian Indonesians''' ({{lang-id|Orang India Indonesia}}; {{lang-ta|இந்தோனேஷியா இந்தியர்கள்}}) are a group of people who live in [[Indonesia]] and whose ancestors originally came from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Therefore, this term can be regarded as a blanket term for not only Indonesian Indian proper, but also Indonesian Pakistanis. According to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, there were about 120,000 people of Indian origin as well as 9,000 Indian nationals living and working in Indonesia as of January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mea.gov.in/mystart.php?id=50044478|title=Sorry for the inconvenience.|website=Mea.gov.in|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them were concentrated in province of [[North Sumatra]]
and urban areas such as [[Banda Aceh]], [[Surabaya]], [[Medan]] and [[Jakarta]].
However, it is almost impossible to get correct statistical figures on the Indian Indonesian population, because most them have merged and assimilated with the indigenous population to become indistinguishable from native Indonesians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Communities in Southeast Asia|edition=First Reprint|year=2006|editors= Sandhu, S Mani, A|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TeExjdWUmJYC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=indian+indonesian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCmoVChMI4qqZ04CfxwIVxTiICh2etAoy#v=onepage&amp;q=indian%20indonesian&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De Jalan Pasar Baroe met veel winkels hier vooral Indiaase en Japanse winkels TMnr 60001115.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|An old Indian enclave in [[Pasar Baru]], Jakarta, Indonesia]]

Various people from the Indian subcontinent have frequented the Indonesian [[archipelago]] since the prehistoric era. In Bali, for example, remains of pottery from the first centuries C.E. have been recovered. In fact, the name Indonesia itself comes from the [[Latin]] ''Indus'' ("India") and [[Greek language|Greek]] ''nêsos'' ("island"), which literally means the "Indian archipelago".

From the 4th and 5th centuries onwards, Indian cultural influences became more visible. The Orthodox Version of Tamil Language was used on inscriptions. However, since the 7th century onward, the Indian scripts were used more often to write down indigenous languages which by now already contained many loan words from [[Prakrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].

In addition to that, indigenous Indonesians began to embrace [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].

It is believed that various Indian people settled in Indonesia, mixed and assimilated with the local population. In an inscription from Central Java in the 9th century, the names of various Indian people (and Southeast-Asian people) are mentioned:

:''ikang warga kilalan kling ārya singhala pandikiri drawiḍa campa kmir...'' (Brandes 1913:1021).
:"the civilians of which one has the use are: people from [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]], [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryas]], [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], people from Pandiya kera = Pandiyas, Keralites ), [[Dravidians]], [[Cham (Asia)|Chams]], and [[Khmer people|Khmer]]..."

Later, with the rise of [[Islam]], this religion was brought to Indonesia by the [[Arabs]] from the 11th century onward, first not to replace the existing religious systems, but to complement them.

Today migrations of people from India still occur. In [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]], there is a large ([[Tamils|Tamil]] people) community estimated at 75,000 people. In all of Indonesia, various North Indians are found. Usually their professions are connected with [[textile]] industries. Like [[Chinese Indonesians]], many are shop owners.

Though there are no official figures, it is estimated that there are around 25,000 PIOs/NRIs living in Indonesia, of whom the Indian expatriate community registered with the Embassy and the Consulate in Medan numbers around 75,000.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van twee Klingalese vrouwen en één kind aan de Sumatraanse oostkust TMnr 10005165.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|Portrait of an Indian family in Sumatra, 1920s]]
Indians have been living in Indonesia for centuries, from the time of the [[Sri Vijaya]] and [[Majapahit]] Empire, both of which were Hindu and heavily influenced by the subcontinent. Indians were later brought to Indonesia by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] in the 19th century as indentured labourers to work on plantations located around Medan in Sumatra. While the majority of these came from South India, a significant number also came from the north. The Medan Indians included Hindus, Muslims and [[Sikh]]s. They have now been in Indonesia for over four generations, and hold Indonesian passports. While local statistics continue to suggest that there are some 400 PIOs in Sumatra, the vast majority are now completely assimilated in Indonesian society, though some elements of the Tamil, Sikh and [[Biharis|Bihari]] communities still maintain their cultural traditions.

The Indian Diaspora also includes several thousand [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] families who constitute the second wave of Indian immigrants who made Indonesia their home in the first half of the 20th century. The Sindhi community is mainly engaged in trading and commerce.

Among these communities, Tamils and to a lesser extent Sikhs were primarily engaged in [[agriculture]], while Sindhis mainly established themselves in the textile trade and the sports business.

The inflow of major Indian investments in Indonesia starting in the late 1970s drew a fresh wave of Indian investors and managers to this country. This group of entrepreneurs and business professionals has further expanded over the past two decades, and now includes engineers, consultants, chartered accountants, bankers, and other professionals.

The Indian community is very well regarded in Indonesia, is generally prosperous, and includes individuals holding senior positions in local and multinational companies.

Due to economic factors, most traders and businessmen among [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|PIO]]s have, over the past decades, moved to [[Jakarta]] from outlying areas such as Medan and [[Surabaya]]. Almost half of the Indian community in Indonesia is now Jakarta-based; it is estimated that the population of Jakarta's Indian community is about 19,000.

There are six main social or professional associations in Jakarta's Indian PIO/NRI community. Gandhi Seva Loka (formerly known as Bombay Merchants Association) is a charitable institution run by the Sindhi community, and is engaged mainly in educational and social activities. Gandhi Memorial International School, Kemoyaran, offers IB curriculum run by the Gandhi Seva Lokha. The India Club is a social organization of PIO/NRI professionals. An Indian Women's Association brings together PIO/[[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRI]] spouses and undertakes charitable activities. There is a Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee in Jakarta, and Sindhis as well as Sikhs are associated with Gurudwara activities. The Economic Association of Indonesia and India (ECAII) brings together leading entrepreneurs from the Indian community with the objective of promoting bilateral economic relations, but this group has been largely inactive. Finally, there is the Indonesian chapter of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).

Tamils have lived in Indonesia since the 1930s. Though predominantly in Medan, Tamil business men have set up various enterprises. Waves of expatriates speaking Tamil language have made Indonesia their home. Indonesia Tamil Manram, a social organisation, is very active In Jakarta, under the able leadership of Mr Sundaraman. It aims to maintain and promote the heritage of Tamil language and culture, create harmony and bridge between Indians and Indonesians through linguistic interests, and provide opportunity for children of expatriates and persons of Indian origin to learn and develop their mother tongue (Tamil).

Indonesian Tamil Manram also teaches the Tamil language to children with Tamil as their mother tongue; conducts programs involving Tamil language and culture; distributes Tamil literature and books to children; organizes Tamil debates, dramas, dance and music programs for local talent; and brings reputable artists from India in the fields of dance, music, drama, and other cultural fields.

Many Indian performers have achieved significant mainstream cultural success. Notable examples are the Punjabi brothers and the Azhari sisters.

Although they are away from India, the Sindhi community and the NRIs in Indonesia have not lost touch with their religious beliefs. Temples, ''[[Gurudwara]]s'' and prayer halls in Jakarta, Medan and other parts of Indonesia are centers for social gathering. The [[Shiva]] temple in [[Pluit]], Jakarta is the center of Indian religious activities. Pluit Perumal is famous, with annual celebrations of ''brahmotsavam'', weekly prayers, and a full-time priest to help devotees offer their prayers. Weekly ''satsangs'', ''Mahasivarathri'' and other important days are also celebrated in the Shiva temple. The annual ''Aiyaapa pooja'' has been celebrated for over two decades, with devotees offering prayers with fervor. Other temples dedicated to the goddess [[Devi]] can be found in [[Tangareng]], [[Kemoyaran]], [[Cikarang]] and Medan in Sumatra. Another temple is dedicated to Lord [[Hanuman]] in [[Jatiluhur]], Indorama factory. ''Gurudwaras'' in [[Tanjung Priok]], Pasar Baru have been in existence for over five decades, and are visited by people of diverse religions.

Love Medan Indians is a social wing of the Holy Trinity Church, whose primary concerns are education, career building and placement for the less-fortunate Medan Tamils, while emphasizing learning Tamil language, English,  art, music and culture. The group is led by Father Alegesan Moses, known as Pastor Moses Alegesan. He is also the priest at the Holy Trinity Church, an Anglican Indian Community-based church whose goal is to contextualize Christian worship in-line with the rich, authentic, Orthodox relevant Indian fervor, without being sincretistic. He is frequently seen to call and challenge the local [[Pemko]] and [[Pemrovsu]] to give attention, care and concern to the Medan Indians. Rev. Father Alegesan Moses MA,  helped to begin and establish the Trinity Tamil Methodist Church, and its worship sanctuary with a touch of sparkling Indian artistic nuances in Medan Indonesia, the church is partnership with the Wesley Methodist Church, Gereja Methodist Indonesia(GMI). He played the single most important role in re-establishing the Tamil identity, with various programs promoting the splendor of Indian choreographics through Baratha-Nattyam and encouraging Tabla classes, Tamil Language Classes “நீங்களும் தமிழ் பேசலாம்” &amp; “தமில் எழிதில் படிக்கலாம்” (Yes you also could speak Tamil, and Tamil is an easy language). He reinstated “Kampung Madras” in Medan, a settlement of Indians, where in the passage of time termed by the locals as “Kampung Keling” a derogatively-insulting slur towards the Indians in Medan. This reinstatement, was consented and approved by His Majesty the Governor of North Sumatera, Sri Lelawangsa  Mr. Haji Syamsul Arifin a Tamil descend whose fore-parents hailed from Karaikal, in Tamilnadu, and in the present of the Mr. Parlindungan Purba a State Assembly Man representing North Sumatera, as well as Mr. Daermando Purba, the Chief Chair Person of the ministry of Transportation.(2008)

The '''Indo-Greek Kingdom''' or '''Graeco-Indian Kingdom'''&lt;ref&gt;As in other compounds such as "African-American", "Asian-American", "French-Canadian" and so on, the nationality or race of the newcomers usually comes first, and the area of arrival comes second, so that "Greco-Indian" is normally a more accurate nomenclature than "Indo-Greek". The latter however has become the general usage, especially since the publication of Narain's book ''The Indo-Greeks''. In Thomas McEvilley 2002 "The Shape of Ancient Greek Thought" p.395 Note 52&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] kingdom covering various parts of [[Afghanistan]] and the northwest regions of the [[Indian subcontinent]] (parts of modern [[Pakistan]] and northwestern [[India]]),&lt;ref name="Spielvogel2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson J.

The kingdom was founded when the [[Graeco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] invaded the subcontinent early in the 2nd century BC. The Greeks in the [[Indian Subcontinent]] were eventually divided from the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Graeco-Bactrians]] centered in Bactria (now the border between [[Afghanistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]), and the Indo-Greeks in the present-day north-western Indian Subcontinent. The most famous Indo-Greek ruler was [[Menander I|Menander (Milinda)]]. He had his capital at [[Sagala|Sakala]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] (present-day [[Sialkot]]).

The expression "Indo-Greek Kingdom" loosely describes a number of various dynastic polities, traditionally associated with a number of regional capitals like [[Taxila]],&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer Wheeler ''Flames over Persepolis'' (London, 1968). Pp. 112 ''ff.'' It is unclear whether the Hellenistic street plan found by Sir John Marshall's excavations dates from the Indo-Greeks or from the Kushans, who would have encountered it in Bactria; Tarn (1951, pp. 137, 179) ascribes the initial move of Taxila to the hill of Sirkap to Demetrius I, but sees this as "not a Greek city but an Indian one"; not a ''polis'' or with a [[Hippodamian plan]].&lt;/ref&gt; (modern [[Punjab (Pakistan)]]), [[Pushkalavati]] and [[Sagala]].&lt;ref&gt;"Menander had his capital in Sagala" Bopearachchi, "Monnaies", p.83. McEvilley supports Tarn on both points, citing Woodcock: "Menander was a Bactrian Greek king of the Euthydemid dynasty. His capital (was) at Sagala (Sialkot) in the Punjab, "in the country of the Yonakas (Greeks)"." McEvilley, p.377. However, "Even if Sagala proves to be Sialkot, it does not seem to be Menander's capital for the Milindapanha states that Menander came down to Sagala to meet Nagasena, just as the Ganges flows to the sea."&lt;/ref&gt; Other potential centers are only hinted at; for instance, [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' and the nomenclature of later kings suggest that a certain [[Theophilos (king)|Theophila]] in the south of the Indo-Greek sphere of influence may also have been a [[satrap]]al or royal seat at one time.

During the two centuries of their rule, the Indo-Greek kings combined the Greek and Indian languages and symbols, as seen on their coins, and blended Greek and Indian ideas, as seen in the archaeological remains.&lt;ref&gt;"A vast hoard of coins, with a mixture of Greek profiles and Indian symbols, along with interesting sculptures and some monumental remains from Taxila, Sirkap and Sirsukh, point to a rich fusion of Indian and Hellenistic influences", ''India, the Ancient Past'', Burjor Avari, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; The diffusion of Indo-Greek culture had consequences which are still felt today, particularly through the influence of [[Greco-Buddhist art]].&lt;ref name="sanujit"&gt;Ghose, Sanujit (2011). [http://www.ancient.eu.com/article/208/ "Cultural links between India and the Greco-Roman world"]. Ancient History Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnicity of the Indo-Greek may also have been hybrid to some degree. [[Euthydemus I]] was, according to Polybius,&lt;ref name="11.34"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+11.34 11.34]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Magnetes|Magnesian]] [[Greek people|Greek]]. His son, [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]], founder of the Indo-Greek kingdom, was therefore of Greek ethnicity at least by his father. A marriage treaty was arranged for the same Demetrius with a daughter of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] ruler [[Antiochus III]] (who had some [[Persian people|Persian]] descent).&lt;ref name="Polybius 11.34"/&gt; The ethnicity of later Indo-Greek rulers is sometimes less clear.&lt;ref&gt;([https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/623931?uid=3739616&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102674788243 "Notes on Hellenism in Bactria and India".] W. W. Tarn. ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'', Vol. 22 (1902), pp. 268–293).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Artemidoros]] (80 BC) may have been of [[Indo-Scythian]] ascendency, although this is now disputed.&lt;ref name="academia1"&gt;Osmund Bopearachchi [https://www.academia.edu/14260604/Was_Indo-Greek_Artemidoros_the_son_of_Indo-Sctythian_Maues Was Indo-Greek Artemidoros the son of Indo-Sctythian Maues]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the death of Menander,  most of his empire splintered and Indo-Greek influence was considerably reduced. Many new kingdoms and republics east of the [[Ravi River]] began to mint new coinage depicting military victories.&lt;ref&gt;"Most of the people east of the Ravi already noticed as within Menander's empire -Audumbaras, Trigartas, Kunindas, Yaudheyas, Arjunayanas- began to coins in the first century BC, which means that they had become independent kingdoms or republics.", Tarn, The Greeks in Bactria and India&lt;/ref&gt;  The most prominent entities to form were the [[Yaudheya]] Republic,  [[Arjunayanas]], and the [[Audumbaras]]. The Yaudheyas and Arjunayanas both are said to have won "victory by the sword".&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HeJS3nE9cAC&amp;pg=PA324#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Greeks in Bactria and India| isbn=9781108009416| last1=Tarn| first1=William Woodthorpe| date=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Datta dynasty]] and [[Mitra dynasty]] soon followed in [[Mathura]]. The Indo-Greeks ultimately disappeared as a political entity around 10 AD following the invasions of the [[Indo-Scythian]]s, although pockets of Greek populations probably remained for several centuries longer under the subsequent rule of the [[Indo-Parthian]]s and [[Kushans]].&lt;ref&gt;"When the Greeks of Bactria and India lost their kingdom they were not all killed, nor did they return to Greece. They merged with the people of the area and worked for the new masters; contributing considerably to the culture and civilization in southern and central Asia."

==Background==

===Preliminary Greek presence in the Indian Subcontinent===
[[File:Pataliputra Palace capital by L A Waddell 1895.jpg|thumb|[[Pataliputra capital|Pataliputra Palace capital]], showing Greek and Persian influence, early [[Mauryan Empire]] period, 3rd century BC.]] 
In 326 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|conquered the northwestern part]] of the Indian subcontinent as far as the [[Beas River|Hyphasis River]], and established [[satrapies]] and founded several settlements, including [[Alexandria Bucephalous|Bucephala]]; he turned south when his troops refused to go further east.&lt;ref&gt;''India, the Ancient Past'', Burjor Avari, p. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian satrapies of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] were left to the rule of [[King Porus|Porus]] and [[Taxiles]], who were confirmed again at the [[Treaty of Triparadisus]] in 321 BC, and remaining Greek troops in these satrapies were left under the command of general [[Eudemus (general)|Eudemus]]. After 321 BC Eudemus toppled Taxiles, until he left India in 316 BC. To the south, another general also ruled over the Greek colonies of the Indus: [[Peithon, son of Agenor]],&lt;ref&gt;:"To the colonies settled in India, Python, the son of Agenor, was sent." [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/english/trans13.html Justin XIII.4]&lt;/ref&gt; until his departure for [[Babylon]] in 316 BC.

Around 322 BC, the Greeks (described as [[Yona]] or [[Yavana]] in Indian sources) may then have participated, together with other groups, in the armed uprising of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] against the [[Nanda Dynasty]], and gone as far as [[Pataliputra]] for the capture of the city from the Nandas. The [[Mudrarakshasa]] of Visakhadutta as well as the [[Jain]]a work Parisishtaparvan talk of Chandragupta's alliance with the Himalayan king Parvatka, often identified with [[Porus]],&lt;ref&gt;Chandragupta Maurya and His Times, Radhakumud Mookerji, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1966, p.26-27 [https://books.google.com/books?id=i-y6ZUheQH8C&amp;pg=PA27]&lt;/ref&gt; and according to these accounts, this alliance gave Chandragupta a composite and powerful army made up of [[Yavana]]s (Greeks), [[Kambojas]], [[Saka|Shaka]]s (Scythians), [[Kiratas]] (Nepalese), [[Persian people|Parasika]]s (Persians) and [[Bahlikas]] (Bactrians) who took [[Pataliputra]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandragupta Maurya and His Times, Radhakumud Mookerji, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1966, p.27 [https://books.google.com/books?id=i-y6ZUheQH8C&amp;pg=PA27]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History Of The Chamar Dynasty, Raj Kumar, Gyan Publishing House, 2008, p.51 [https://books.google.com/books?id=eEJ-sXBmBIkC&amp;pg=PA51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[Pataliputra|Kusumapura]] was besieged from every direction by the forces of [[Porus|Parvata]] and Chandragupta: Shakas, Yavanas, Kiratas, Kambojas, Parasikas, Bahlikas and others, assembled on the advice of [[Chanakya]]" in [[Mudrarakshasa]] 2.

In 305 BC, [[Seleucus I]] led an army to the [[Indus]], where he encountered [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]]. The confrontation ended with a peace treaty, and "an intermarriage agreement" ([[Epigamia]], Greek: Ἐπιγαμία), meaning either a dynastic marriage or an agreement for intermarriage between Indians and Greeks. Accordingly, Seleucus ceded to Chandragupta his northwestern territories, possibly as far as [[Arachosia]] and received 500 [[war elephant]]s (which played a key role in the victory of Seleucus at the [[Battle of Ipsus]]):&lt;ref&gt;''India, the Ancient Past'', Burjor Avari, p. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Indians occupy in part some of the countries situated along the Indus, which formerly belonged to the Persians: Alexander deprived the Ariani of them, and established there settlements of his own.

The details of the marriage agreement are not known,&lt;ref name="Barua2005"&gt;Barua, Pradeep. [https://muse.jhu.edu/book/11919 The State at War in South Asia]. Vol. 2. U of Nebraska Press, 2005. pp13-15 via [[Project MUSE]] {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since the extensive sources available on Seleucus never mention an Indian princess, it is thought that the marital alliance went the other way, with Chandragupta himself or his son Bindusara marrying a Seleucid princess, in accordance with contemporary Greek practices to form dynastic alliances. An Indian [[Puranic]] source, the [[Pratisargaparvan|Pratisarga Parva]] of the [[Bhavishya Purana]], described the marriage of Chandragupta with a Greek ("[[Yavana]]") princess, daughter of Seleucus,&lt;ref name="Sagar"&gt;Foreign Influence on Ancient India, Krishna Chandra Sagar, Northern Book Centre, 1992, p.83 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0UA4rkm9MgkC&amp;pg=PA83]&lt;/ref&gt; before accurately detailing early Mauryan genealogy:

Also several Greeks, such as the historian [[Megasthenes]],&lt;ref&gt;''India, the Ancient Past'', Burjor Avari, p.108-109&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Deimachus]] and [[Dionysius (ambassador)|Dionysius]], were sent to reside at the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] court.&lt;ref&gt;"Three Greek ambassadors are known by name: Megasthenes, ambassador to Chandragupta; Deimachus, ambassador to [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta's]] son Bindusara; and Dyonisius, whom Ptolemy Philadelphus sent to the court of Ashoka, Bindusara's son", McEvilley, p.367&lt;/ref&gt; Presents continued to be exchanged between the two rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Classical sources have recorded that following their treaty, Chandragupta and Seleucus exchanged presents, such as when Chandragupta sent various [[aphrodisiac]]s to Seleucus: "And Theophrastus says that some contrivances are of wondrous efficacy in such matters as to make people more amorous. And Phylarchus confirms him, by reference to some of the presents which Sandrakottus, the king of the Indians, sent to Seleucus; which were to act like charms in producing a wonderful degree of affection, while some, on the contrary, were to banish love" [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]], "[[The deipnosophists]]" Book I, chapter 32 [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature000701860036&amp;isize=M&amp;pview=hide Ath. Deip. I.32]. Mentioned in McEvilley, p.367&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of these contacts is testified by the existence of a dedicated Mauryan state department for Greek ([[Yavana]]) and Persian foreigners,&lt;ref&gt;"The very fact that both [[Megasthenes]] and [[Kautilya]] refer to a state department run and maintained specifically for the purpose of looking after foreigners, who were mostly Yavanas and Persians, testifies to the impact created by these contacts.", Narain, "The Indo-Greeks", p.363&lt;/ref&gt; or the remains of [[Hellenistic]] pottery that can be found throughout northern India.&lt;ref&gt;"It also explains (...) random finds from the [[Sarnath]], Basarth, and [[Patna]] regions of terra-cotta pieces of distinctive Hellenistic or with definite Hellenistic motifs and designs", Narain, "The Indo-Greeks" 2003, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

On these occasions, Greek populations apparently remained in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent under Mauryan rule. Chandragupta's grandson [[Ashoka]], who had converted to the Buddhist faith declared in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, some of them written in Greek,&lt;ref&gt;"The second Kandahar edict (the purely Greek one) of Ashoka is a part of the "corpus" known as the "Fourteen-Rock-Edicts"" Narain, "The Indo-Greeks" 2003, p.452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It is also in Kandahar that were found the fragments of a Greek translation of Edicts XII and XIII, as well as the Aramean translation of another edict of Ashoka", Bussagli, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; that Greek populations within his realm also had converted to Buddhism:&lt;ref&gt;"Within Ashoka's domain Greeks may have had special privileges, perhaps ones established by the terms of the Seleucid alliance. Rock Edict Thirteen indicates the existence of a Greek principality in the northwest of Ashoka's empire -perhaps Kandahar, or Alexandria-of-the-Arachosians- which was not ruled by him and for which he troubled to send Buddhist missionaries and published at least some of his edicts in Greek", McEvilley, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhras]] and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].|[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]] (S. Dhammika).}}

In his edicts, Ashoka mentions that he had sent Buddhist emissaries to Greek rulers as far as the Mediterranean ([[Edicts of Ashoka|Edict No. 13]]),&lt;ref&gt;"Thirteen, the longest and most important of the edicts, contains the claim, seemingly outlandish t first glance, that Ashoka had sent missions to the lands of the Greek monarchs -not only those of Asia, such as the Seleucids, but those back in the Mediterranean also", McEvilley, p.368&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Ashoka was converted to Buddhism, his first thought was to despatch missionaries to his friends, the Greek monarchs of Egypt, Syria, and Macedonia", Rawlinson, ''Intercourse between India and the Western world'', p.39, quoted in McEvilley, p.368&lt;/ref&gt; and that he developed [[herbal medicine]] in their territories, for the welfare of humans and animals ([[Edicts of Ashoka|Edict No. 2]]).&lt;ref&gt;"In Rock Edict Two Ashoka even claims to have established hospitals for men and beasts in the Hellenistic kingdoms", McEvilley, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks in India even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka such as [[Dharmaraksita]],&lt;ref&gt;"One of the most famous of these emissaries, Dharmaraksita, who was said to have converted thousands, was a Greek (Mhv.XII.5 and 34)", McEvilley, p.370&lt;/ref&gt; or the teacher [[Mahadharmaraksita]],&lt;ref&gt;"The Mahavamsa tells that "the celebrated Greek teacher Mahadharmaraksita in the second century BC led a delegation of 30,000 monks from Alexandria-of-the-Caucasus (Alexandra-of-the-Yonas, or of-the-Greeks, the Ceylonese text actually says) to the opening of the great Ruanvalli Stupa at Anuradhapura"", McEvilley, p. 370, quoting Woodcock, "The Greeks in India", p.55&lt;/ref&gt; are described in [[Pali]] sources as leading Greek ("[[Yona]]", i.e., Ionian) Buddhist monks, active in Buddhist proselytism (the [[Mahavamsa]], XII).&lt;ref&gt;Full text of the Mahavamsa [http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chapters.html Click chapter XII]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also thought that Greeks contributed to the sculptural work of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]],&lt;ref&gt;"The finest of the pillars were executed by Greek or Perso-Greek sculptors; others by local craftsmen, with or without foreign supervision" Marshall, "The Buddhist art of Gandhara", p4&lt;/ref&gt; and more generally to the blossoming of Mauryan art.&lt;ref&gt;"A number of foreign artisans, such as the Persians or even the Greeks, worked alongside the local craftsmen, and some of their skills were copied with avidity" Burjor Avari, "India, The ancient past", p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Some Greeks (Yavanas) may have played an administrative role in the territories ruled by Ashoka: the [[Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman]] records that during the rule of Ashoka, a [[Yavana]] King/ Governor named [[Tushaspha]] was in charge in the area of [[Girnar]], [[Gujarat]], mentioning his role in the construction of a water reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Influence on Ancient India

===Greek rule in Bactria===
[[File:PhilosopherBust.jpg|thumb|Greco-Bactrian statue of an old man or philosopher, [[Ai Khanoum]], [[Bactria]], 2nd century BC]]
{{Main article|Greco-Bactrian Kingdom}}
Alexander had also established several colonies in neighbouring [[Bactria]], such as [[Alexandria on the Oxus]] (modern [[Ai-Khanoum]]) and [[Alexandria of the Caucasus]] (medieval [[Kapisa (city)|Kapisa]], modern [[Bagram]]). After Alexander's death in 323 BC, Bactria came under the control of [[Seleucus I Nicator]], who founded the [[Seleucid Empire]]. The Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was founded when Diodotus I, the [[satrap]] of Bactria (and probably the surrounding provinces) seceded from the Seleucid Empire around 250 BC. The preserved ancient sources (see below) are somewhat contradictory and the exact date of Bactrian independence has not been settled. Somewhat simplified, there is a high chronology (c. 255 BC) and a low chronology (c. 246 BC) for Diodotos’ secession.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Lerner, The Impact of Seleucid Decline on the Eastern Iranian Plateau: the Foundations of Arsacid Parthia and Graeco-Bactria, (Stuttgart 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The high chronology has the advantage of explaining why the Seleucid king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochus II]] issued very few coins in Bactria, as Diodotos would have become independent there early in Antiochus' reign.&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Holt, Thundering Zeus (Berkeley 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the low chronology, from the mid-240s BC, has the advantage of connecting the secession of Diodotus I with the [[Third Syrian War]], a catastrophic conflict for the Seleucid Empire.

{{quote|Diodotus, the governor of the thousand cities of Bactria ({{lang-la|Theodotus, mille urbium Bactrianarum praefectus}}), defected and proclaimed himself king; all the other people of the Orient followed his example and seceded from the Macedonians.|([[Junianus Justinus|Justin]], XLI,4&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte41.html Justin XLI, paragraph 4]&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

The new kingdom, highly urbanized and considered as one of the richest of the Orient (''opulentissimum illud mille urbium Bactrianum imperium'' "The extremely prosperous Bactrian empire of the thousand cities" Justin, XLI,1&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte41.html Justin XLI, paragraph 1]&lt;/ref&gt;), was to further grow in power and engage into territorial expansion to the east and the west:

{{quote|The Greeks who caused Bactria to revolt grew so powerful on account of the fertility of the country that they became masters, not only of [[Ariana]], but also of [[India]], as [[Apollodorus of Artemita]] says: and more tribes were subdued by them than by Alexander... Their cities were [[Bactra]] (also called Zariaspa, through which flows a river bearing the same name and emptying into the [[Oxus]]), and Darapsa, and several others. Among these was [[Eucratideia|Eucratidia]], which was named after its ruler.|(Strabo, XI.XI.I&lt;ref name="Strabo XI.XI.I"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+11.11.1 Strabo XI.XI.I]&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

[[File:CapitalSharp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capital, found at [[Ai-Khanoum]], 2nd century BC]]
When the ruler of neighbouring [[Parthia]], the former satrap and self-proclaimed king [[Andragoras (3rd century BC)|Andragoras]], was eliminated by [[Arsaces]], the rise of the [[Parthian Empire]] cut off the Greco-Bactrians from direct contact with the Greek world. Overland trade continued at a reduced rate, while sea trade between [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Greek Egypt]] and Bactria developed.

Diodotus was succeeded by his son [[Diodotus II]], who allied himself with the Parthian [[Arsaces I of Parthia|Arsaces]] in his fight against [[Seleucus II Callinicus|Seleucus II]]:

{{quote|Soon after, relieved by the death of Diodotus, Arsaces made peace and concluded an alliance with his son, also by the name of Diodotus; some time later he fought against Seleucos who came to punish the rebels, and he prevailed: the Parthians celebrated this day as the one that marked the beginning of their freedom|(Justin, XLI,4)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte41.html Justin XLI]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Euthydemus's control extended to Sogdiana, going beyond the city of [[Alexandria Eschate]] founded by Alexander the Great in [[Ferghana]]:

{{quote|"And they also held Sogdiana, situated above Bactriana towards the east between the Oxus River, which forms the boundary between the Bactrians and the Sogdians, and the [[Iaxartes]] River.

[[Euthydemus I|Euthydemus]] was attacked by the Seleucid ruler [[Antiochus III]] around 210 BC. Although he commanded 10,000 horsemen, Euthydemus initially lost a battle on the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Arius]]&lt;ref name="Polybius 10.49, Battle of the Arius"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+10.49 Polybius 10.49, Battle of the Arius]&lt;/ref&gt; and had to retreat. He then successfully resisted a three-year siege in the fortified city of [[Bactra]] (modern [[Balkh]]), before Antiochus finally decided to recognize the new ruler, and to offer one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] around 206 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+11.34 Polybius 11.34 Siege of Bactra]&lt;/ref&gt; Classical accounts also relate that Euthydemus negotiated peace with Antiochus III by suggesting that he deserved credit for overthrowing the original rebel Diodotus, and that he was protecting Central Asia from nomadic invasions thanks to his defensive efforts:

Following the departure of the Seleucid army, the Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded. In the west, areas in north-eastern [[Iran]] may have been absorbed, possibly as far as into [[Parthia]], whose ruler had been defeated by [[Antiochus III|Antiochus the Great]]. These territories possibly are identical with the Bactrian satrapies of [[Tapuria]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Traxiane]].

To the north, Euthydemus also ruled [[Sogdiana]] and [[Fergana Valley|Ferghana]], and there are indications that from [[Alexandria Eschate]] the Greco-Bactrians may have led expeditions as far as [[Kashgar]] and [[Ürümqi]] in [[Xinjiang|Chinese Turkestan]], leading to the first known contacts between China and the West around 220 BC. The Greek historian [[Strabo]] too writes that:

[[File:Bronze Warrior Statue without shade.jpg|thumb|Possible statuette of a Greek soldier, wearing a version of the Greek [[Phrygian helmet]], from a 3rd-century BC burial site north of the [[Tian Shan]], [[Xinjiang Region Museum]], [[Urumqi]].]]
Several statuettes and representations of Greek soldiers have been found north of the [[Tien Shan]], on the doorstep to China, and are today on display in the [[Xinjiang]] museum at [[Urumqi]] (Boardman&lt;ref&gt;On the image of the Greek kneeling warrior: "A bronze figurine of a kneeling warrior, not Greek work, but wearing a version of the Greek Phrygian helmet.. From a burial, said to be of the 4th century BC, just north of the Tien Shan range". Ürümqi Xinjiang Museum. (Boardman "The diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity")&lt;/ref&gt;).

Greek influences on Chinese art have also been suggested ([[Friedrich Hirth|Hirth]], [[Rostovtzeff]]). Designs with [[rosette (design)|rosette]] flowers, geometric lines, and glass inlays, suggestive of Hellenistic influences,&lt;ref&gt;Notice of the British Museum on the Zhou vase (2005, attached image): "Red earthenware bowl, decorated with a slip and inlaid with glass paste. Eastern Zhou period, 4th–3rd century BC. This bowl was probably intended to copy a more precious and possibly foreign vessel in bronze or even silver. Glass was little used in China. Its popularity at the end of the Eastern Zhou period was probably due to foreign influence."&lt;/ref&gt; can be found on some early [[Han dynasty]] bronze mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;"The things which China received from the Graeco-Iranian world-the pomegranate and other "Chang-Kien" plants, the heavy equipment of the cataphract, the traces of Greeks influence on Han art (such as) the famous white bronze mirror of the Han period with Graeco-Bactrian designs (...) in the Victoria and Albert Museum" (Tarn, ''The Greeks in Bactria and India'', pp. 363–364)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Numismatics]] also suggest that some technology exchanges may have occurred on these occasions: the Greco-Bactrians were the first in the world to issue [[cupro-nickel]] (75/25 ratio) coins,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dougsmith.ancients.info/feac58bak.html Copper-Nickel coinage in Greco-Bactria.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306233802/http://dougsmith.ancients.info/feac58bak.html |date=2005-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an alloy technology only known by the Chinese at the time under the name "White copper" (some weapons from the [[Warring States period]] were in copper-nickel alloy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/e20026/sunzi1.htm Ancient Chinese weapons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307083704/http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/e20026/sunzi1.htm |date=2005-03-07 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20051016180908/http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/e20026/images/t20026/p581.jpg A halberd of copper-nickel alloy, from the Warring States Period.]&lt;/ref&gt;). The practice of exporting Chinese metals, in particular iron, for trade is attested around that period. Kings Euthydemus, Euthydemus II, [[Agathocles of Bactria|Agathocles]] and [[Pantaleon]] made these coin issues around 170 BC and it has alternatively been suggested that a nickeliferous copper ore was the source from mines at [[Anarak]].&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Moss pp317-318 ''Numismatic Chronicle'' 1950&lt;/ref&gt; Copper-nickel would not be used again in coinage until the 19th century.

The presence of Chinese people in the Indian subcontinent from ancient times is also suggested by the accounts of the "[[Chinas|Ciñas]]" in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the ''[[Manu Smriti]]''.

The [[Han Dynasty]] explorer and ambassador [[Zhang Qian]] visited Bactria in 126 BC, and reported the presence of Chinese products in the Bactrian markets:
{{quote|"When I was in Bactria ([[Daxia]])", Zhang Qian reported, "I saw bamboo canes from Qiong and cloth made in the province of Shu (territories of southwestern China). When I asked the people how they had gotten such articles, they replied, "Our merchants go buy them in the markets of Shendu (India)."|(''[[Shiji]]'' 123, [[Sima Qian]], trans. Burton Watson)}}

Upon his return, Zhang Qian informed the Chinese emperor Han [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Wudi]] of the level of sophistication of the urban civilizations of Ferghana, Bactria and Parthia, who became interested in developing commercial relationships with them:

{{quote|The Son of Heaven on hearing all this reasoned thus: [[Ferghana]] ([[Dayuan]]) and the possessions of [[Bactria]] ([[Daxia]]) and [[Parthia]] ([[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia|Anxi]]) are large countries, full of rare things, with a population living in fixed abodes and given to occupations somewhat identical with those of the Chinese people, and placing great value on the rich produce of China|(''[[Hanshu]]'', Former Han History)}}

A number of Chinese envoys were then sent to Central Asia, triggering the development of the [[Silk Road]] from the end of the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 C.Michael Hogan, ''Silk Road, North China'', Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AiKhanoumAndIndia.jpg|thumb|[[Greco-Bactria]] and the city of [[Ai-Khanoum]] were located at the very doorstep of [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan]] India.]]
[[File:Khalsi rock edict of Ashoka.jpg|thumb|The [[Khalsi]] rock [[Edicts of Ashoka|edict of Ashoka]], which mentions the Greek kings [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochus]], [[Ptolemy II of Egypt|Ptolemy]], [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonus]], [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]] by name, as recipients of his teachings.]]
The Indian emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]], founder of the [[Mauryan dynasty]], had re-conquered northwestern India upon the death of [[Alexander the Great]] around 322 BC. However, contacts were kept with his Greek neighbours in the [[Seleucid Empire]], a dynastic alliance or the recognition of intermarriage between Greeks and Indians were established (described as an agreement on [[Epigamia]] in Ancient sources), and several Greeks, such as the historian [[Megasthenes]], resided at the Mauryan court. Subsequently, each Mauryan emperor had a Greek ambassador at his court.

Chandragupta's grandson [[Ashoka]] converted to the Buddhist faith and became a great proselytizer in the line of the traditional Pali canon of [[Theravada]] Buddhism, directing his efforts towards the Indian and the Hellenistic worlds from around 250 BC. According to the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, some of them written in Greek, he sent Buddhist emissaries to the Greek lands in Asia and as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts name each of the rulers of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] world at the time.

{{quote|The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred [[yojana]]s (4,000 miles) away, where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] rules, beyond there where the four kings named [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]], [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]], [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]] rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, and as far as [[Tamraparni]].|([[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika)}}

Some of the Greek populations that had remained in northwestern India apparently converted to Buddhism:

{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the [[Satavahanas|Andhras]] and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].|([[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika)}}

Furthermore, according to [[Pāli|Pali]] sources, some of Ashoka's emissaries were Greek Buddhist monks, indicating close religious exchanges between the two cultures:

{{quote|When the thera (elder) Moggaliputta, the illuminator of the religion of the Conqueror (Ashoka), had brought the (third) council to an end… he sent forth theras, one here and one there: …and to Aparantaka (the "Western countries" corresponding to [[Gujarat]] and [[Sindh]]) he sent the Greek ([[Yona]]) named [[Dharmaraksita|Dhammarakkhita]]... and the thera Maharakkhita he sent into the country of the Yona.|([[Mahavamsa]] XII)}}

Greco-Bactrians probably received these Buddhist emissaries (At least Maharakkhita, lit. "The Great Saved One", who was "sent to the country of the Yona") and somehow tolerated the Buddhist faith, although little proof remains.  In the 2nd century AD, the Christian dogmatist [[Clement of Alexandria]] recognized the existence of Buddhist [[Sramana]]s among the Bactrians ("Bactrians" meaning "Oriental Greeks" in that period), and even their influence on Greek thought:

{{quote|Thus philosophy, a thing of the highest utility, flourished in antiquity among the barbarians, shedding its light over the nations. And afterwards it came to [[Greece]]. First in its ranks were the prophets of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]; and the [[Chaldea]]ns among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]; and the [[Druids]] among the [[Gauls]]; and the '''[[Sramana]]s''' among the [[Bactrians]] ("Σαρμαναίοι Βάκτρων"); and the philosophers of the [[Celts]]; and the [[Magi]] of the [[Persian people|Persians]], who foretold the Saviour's birth, and came into the land of [[Judea]] guided by a star. The Indian [[gymnosophist]]s are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called '''[[Sramana]]s''' ("Σαρμάναι"), and others [[Brahmins]] ("Βραφμαναι").|Clement of Alexandria|"The Stromata, or Miscellanies" Book I, Chapter XV&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book1.html Clement of Alexandria "The Stromata, or Miscellanies" Book I, Chapter XV]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Rise of the Shungas (185 BC)===
[[File:Sunga horseman Bharhut.jpg|thumb|upright|Shunga horseman, [[Bharhut]].]]
{{Main article|Shunga Empire}}
In India, the Maurya Dynasty was overthrown around 185 BC when [[Pushyamitra Shunga]], the commander-in-chief of Mauryan Imperial forces and a [[Brahmin]], assassinated the last of the Mauryan emperors [[Brihadratha Maurya|Brihadratha]].&lt;ref&gt;"General Pushyamitra, who is at the origin of the Shunga dynasty. He was supported by the Brahmins and even became the symbol of the Brahmanical turnover against the Buddhism of the Mauryas. The capital was then transferred to Pataliputra (today's [[Patna]])", Bussagli, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pushyamitra is described as a "senapati" (Commander-in-chief) of Brihadratha in the [[Puranas]]&lt;/ref&gt; Pushyamitra Shunga then ascended the throne and established the [[Shunga Empire]], which extended its control as far west as the [[Punjab region|Punjab]].

Buddhist sources, such as the ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', mention that Pushyamitra was hostile towards Buddhists and allegedly persecuted the [[Buddhism|Buddhist faith]]. A large number of Buddhist monasteries ([[vihara]]s) were allegedly converted to [[Hindu]] temples, in such places as [[Nalanda]], [[Bodhgaya]], [[Sarnath]] or [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]. While it is established by secular sources that [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] were in competition during this time, with the Shungas preferring the former to the latter, historians such as [[Etienne Lamotte]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Lamotte: History of Indian Buddhism, Institut Orientaliste, Louvain-la-Neuve 1988 (1958), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Romila Thapar]]&lt;ref&gt;Aśoka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press,1960 p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; argue that Buddhist accounts of persecution of Buddhists by Shungas are largely exaggerated. Some [[Puranic]] sources however also describe the resurgence of [[Brahmanism]] following the [[Maurya Dynasty]], and the killing of millions of Buddhists, such as the ''[[Pratisargaparvan|Pratisarga Parva]]'' of the ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'':&lt;ref name="EIT"&gt;Encyclopaedia of Indian Traditions and Cultural Heritage, Anmol Publications, 2009, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Indo-Greeks (sources)}}
Some narrative history has survived for most of the Hellenistic world, at least of the kings and the wars;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Polybius]], [[Arrian]], [[Livy]], [[Cassius Dio]], and [[Diodorus]]. Justin, who will be discussed shortly, provides a summary of the histories of Hellenistic Macedonia, Egypt, Asia, and Parthia.&lt;/ref&gt; this is lacking for India. The main Greco-Roman source on the Indo-Greeks is [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], who wrote an anthology drawn from the Roman historian [[Pompeius Trogus]], who in turn wrote, from Greek sources, at the time of [[Augustus Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;For the date of Trogus, see the ''OCD'' on "Trogus" and Yardley/Develin, p. 2; since Trogus' father was in charge of [[Julius Caesar]]'s diplomatic missions before the history was written (Justin 43.5.11), Senior's date in the following quotation is too early: "The Western sources for accounts of Bactrian and Indo-Greek history are: Polybius, a Greek born c.200 BC; Strabo, a Roman who drew on the lost history of Apollodoros of Artemita (c. 130–87 BC), and Justin, who drew on Trogus, a post 87 BC writer", Senior, ''Indo-Scythian coins IV'', p.x; the extent to which Strabo is citing Apollodorus is disputed, beyond the three places he names Apollodorus (and he may have those through Eratosthenes). Polybius speaks of Bactria, not of India.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these dozen sentences, the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions India a few times in the course of his long dispute with [[Eratosthenes]] about the shape of Eurasia. Most of these are purely geographical claims, but he does mention that Eratosthenes' sources say that some of the Greek kings conquered further than Alexander; Strabo does not believe them on this, nor does he believe that [[Menander I|Menander]] and Demetrius son of Euthydemus conquered more tribes than Alexander&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geographia'' 11.11.1 p.516 ''Casaubon''. 15.1.2, p. 686 ''Casaubon'', "tribes" is Jones' version of ''ethne'' (Loeb)&lt;/ref&gt; There is half a story about Menander in one of the books of [[Polybius]] which has not come down to us intact.&lt;ref&gt;For a list of classical testimonia, see Tarn's Index II; but this covers India, Bactria, and several sources for the Hellenstic East as a whole.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are Indian literary sources, ranging from the [[Milinda Panha]], a dialogue between a Buddhist sage [[Nagasena]] and Indianized names that may be related to Indo-Greek kings such as [[Menander I]]. Names in these sources are consistently Indianized, and there is some dispute whether, for example, ''Dharmamitra'' represents "Demetrius" or is an Indian prince with that name. There was also a Chinese expedition to Bactria by [[Chang-k'ien]] under the [[Emperor Wu of Han]], recorded in the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and [[Book of the Former Han]], with additional evidence in the [[Book of the Later Han]]; the identification of places and peoples behind transcriptions into Chinese is difficult, and several alternate interpretations have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, App. 20; Narain (1957) pp. 136, 156 ''et alii''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Other evidence of the broader and longer influence of Indo-Greeks is possibly suggested by [[Yavanarajya inscription]], dated to 1st-century BCE. It mentions [[Yavanas]], a term which is derived from "Ionians", and which at that time most likely means "Indo-Greeks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sonya Rhie Quintanilla|title=History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7Cb8IkZVSMC&amp;pg=PA254 |year=2007| publisher= BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-15537-4|pages=254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion of Demetrius into India===
[[File:DemetriusIMet.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|200px|Silver coin depicting [[Demetrius I of Bactria]] (reigned c. 200–180 BC), wearing an elephant scalp, symbol of his conquests of areas in Northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], what is now [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Demetrius is said to have founded [[Taxila]] (archaeological excavations), and also [[Sagala]] in the Punjab, which he seemed to have called Euthydemia, after his father ("the city of Sagala, also called Euthydemia" (Ptolemy, Geographia, VII 1))&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]], the son of [[Euthydemus I of Bactria|Euthydemus]] is generally considered as the [[Greco-Bactrian]] king who first launched the Greek expansion into [[India]]. He is therefore the founder of the [[Indo-Greek]] realm. The true intents of the Greek kings in occupying India are unknown, but it is thought that the elimination of the [[Maurya Empire]] by the [[Sunga]] greatly encouraged this expansion. The Indo-Greeks, in particular [[Menander I]] who is said in the ''[[Milindapanha]]'' to have converted to Buddhism, also possibly received the help of Indian Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HSoE8qR-5BgC&amp;pg=PA39 A Journey Through India's Past Chandra Mauli Mani, Northern Book Centre, 2005, p.39]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an inscription from his father's reign already officially hailing Demetrius as victorious. He also has one of the few absolute dates in Indo-Greek history: after his father held off [[Antiochus III]] for two years, 208–6 BC, the peace treaty included the offer of a marriage between Demetrius and Antiochus' daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius 11.34&lt;/ref&gt; Coins of Demetrius I have been found in [[Arachosia]] and in the [[Kabul Valley]]; the latter would be the first entry of the Greeks into India, as they defined it. There is also literary evidence for a campaign eastward against the [[Seres]] and the [[Phryni]]; but the order and dating of these conquests is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;The first conquests of Demetrius have usually been held to be during his father's lifetime; the difference has been over the actual date. Tarn and Narain agreed on having them begin around 180; Bopearachchi moved this back to 200, and has been followed by much of the more recent literature, but see ''[[Brill's New Pauly]]: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World'' (Boston, 2006) "Demetrius" §10, which places the invasion "probably in 184". D.H. MacDowall, "The Role of Demetrius in Arachosia and the Kabul Valley", published in the volume: O. Bopearachchi, Landes (ed), ''Afghanistan Ancien Carrefour Entre L'Est Et L'Ouest'', (Brepols 2005) discusses an inscription dedicated to Euthydemus, "Greatest of all kings" and his son Demetrius, who is not called king but "Victorious" (Kallinikos). This is taken to indicate that Demetrius was his father's general during the first conquests. It is uncertain whether the Kabul valley or Arachosia were conquered first, and whether the latter province was taken from the Seleucids after their defeat by the Romans in 190 BC. Peculiar enough, more coins of Euthydemus I than of Demetrius I have been found in the mentioned provinces. The calendar of the "Yonas" is proven by an inscription giving a triple synchronism to have begun in 186/5 BC; what event is commemorated is itself uncertain. Richard Salomon "The Indo-Greek era of 186/5 B.C. in a Buddhist reliquary inscription", in ''Afghanistan, Ancien Carrefour'' cited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demetrius I seems to have conquered the Kabul valley, [[Arachosia]] and perhaps [[Gandhara]];&lt;ref&gt;"Demetrius occupied a large part of the Indus delta, Saurashtra and Kutch", Burjor Avari, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; he struck no Indian coins, so either his conquests did not penetrate that far into India or he died before he could consolidate them. On his coins, Demetrius I always carries the elephant-helmet worn by Alexander, which seems to be a token of his Indian conquests.&lt;ref&gt;"It would be impossible to explain otherwise why in all his portraits Demetrios is crowned with an elephant scalp", Bopearachchi, ''Monnaies'', p.53&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bopearachchi]] believes that Demetrius received the title of "King of India" following his victories south of the Hindu Kush.&lt;ref&gt;"We think that the conquests of these regions south of the Hindu Kush brought to Demetrius I the title of "King of India" given to him by [[Apollodorus of Artemita]]." Bopearachchi, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; He was also given, though perhaps only posthumously, the title {{lang|grc|Ἀνίκητος}} ("Aniketos", lit. ''Invincible'') a cult title of [[Heracles]], which Alexander had assumed; the later Indo-Greek kings Lysias, Philoxenus, and Artemidorus also took it.&lt;ref&gt;For Heracles, see Lillian B. Lawler "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/283364 Orchesis Kallinikos]" ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'', Vol. 79. (1948), pp. 254–267, p. 262; for Artemidorus, see K. Walton Dobbins "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3596097 The Commerce of Kapisene and Gandhāra after the Fall of Indo-Greek Rule]" ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', Vol. 14, No. 3. (Dec., 1971), pp. 286–302 (Both [[JSTOR]]). Tarn, p.132, argues that Alexander did not assume as a title, but was only hailed by it, but see [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], ''The Hellenistic Age'', p.7; see also Senior, Indo-Scythian coins, p.xii. No undisputed coins of Demetrius I himself use this title, but it is employed on one of the pedigree coins issued by Agathocles, which bear on the reverse the classical profile of Demetrius crowned by the elephant scalp, with the legend DEMETRIOS ANIKETOS, and on the reverse Herakles crowning himself, with the legend "Of king Agathocles" (Boppearachchi, "Monnaies", p.179 and Pl 8). Tarn, The Greeks in Bactria and India, Chap IV.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Demetrius may have been the founder of a newly discovered [[Yavana era]], starting in 186/5 BC.&lt;ref&gt;"It now seems most likely that Demetrios was the founder of the newly discovered Greek Era of 186/5", Senior, ''Indo-Scythian coins IV''&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Bactrian kings followed after Demetrius' death, and it seems likely that the civil wars between them made it possible for [[Apollodotus I]] (from c. 180/175 BC) to make himself independent as the first proper Indo-Greek king (who did not rule from Bactria). Large numbers of his coins have been found in India, and he seems to have reigned in Gandhara as well as western Punjab. Apollodotus I was succeeded by or ruled alongside [[Antimachus II]], likely the son of the Bactrian king [[Antimachus I]].&lt;ref&gt;Bopearachchi, ''Monnaies'', p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

The next important Indo-Greek king was [[Menander I|Menander]] (from c. 165/155 BC) who has been described as the greatest of the Indo-Greek Kings;&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/374659/Menander |author= |title=Menander |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |quote=Menander, also spelled Minedra or Menadra, Pali Milinda   (flourished 160 BCE?–135 BCE?), the greatest of the Indo-Greek kings and the one best known to Western and Indian classical authors. He is believed to have been a patron of the Buddhist religion and the subject of an important Buddhist work, the Milinda-panha ("The Questions of Milinda"). Menander was born in the Caucasus, but the Greek biographer Plutarch calls him a king of Bactria, and the Greek geographer and historian Strabo includes him among the Bactrian Greeks "who conquered more tribes than Alexander [the Great]." |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; his coins are found as far as eastern Punjab.

He became a legendary figure as a great patron of Buddhism in the Pali book the Milindapanha. Early Life – Menander (not to be confused with the more famous Greek dramatist of the same name) was born somewhere in the fertile area to the south of the Paropaisadae or present Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan. The only reference to this location is in the semilegendary Milindapanha (first or second century A.D.), which says that he was born in a village called Kalasi near Alasanda, some two hundred yojanas (about eighteen miles) from the town of Sagala (probably Sialkot in the Punjab). The Alasanda refers to the Alexandria in Afghanistan and not the one in Egypt. |page=717 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Menander made Sagala his capital, and after conquering the Punjab region he subsequently made an expedition across northern India and reached the Mauryan capital of [[Patna]]. Soon after, [[Eucratides I]] king of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] began warring with the Indo-Greeks in the north western frontier.

According to [[Apollodorus of Artemita]], quoted by Strabo, the Indo-Greek territory for a while included the Indian coastal provinces of [[Sindh]] and possibly [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Greeks... took possession, not only of [[Patalene|Patalena]], but also, on the rest of the coast, of what is called the kingdom of [[Saraostus]] and [[Sigerdis]]." Strabo 11.11.1 ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+11.11.1 Strabo 11.11.1])&lt;/ref&gt; With archaeological methods, the Indo-Greek territory can however only be confirmed from the [[Kabul]] Valley to the eastern [[Punjab region|Punjab]], so Greek presence outside was probably short-lived or non-existent.

Some sources also claim that the Indo-Greeks may have reached the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] capital [[Pataliputra]] in northeastern India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xPUvqtdfjyAC&amp;pg=PA156 ''The Geography of India: Sacred and Historic Places'' Educational Britannica Educational p.156]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SW"&gt;Shane Wallace [https://www.academia.edu/25638818 Greek Culture in Afghanistan and India: Old Evidence and New Discoveries] 2016, p.210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rocher, Ludo (1986), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=n0-4RJh5FgoC&amp;pg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Puranas]'', p.254: "The [[Yuga Purana|Yuga [Purana]]] is important primarily as a historical document. It is a matter-of-fact chronicle [...] of the [[Magadha]] empire, down to the breakdown of the Sungas and the arrival of the [[Indo-Scythians|Sakas]]. It is unique in its description of the invasion and retirement of the Yavanas in Magadha."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nature of this expedition is a matter of controversy. One theory is that Indo-Greeks were invited to join a raid led by local Indian kings down the Ganges river. The other is that it was a campaign likely made by Menander. Irrespective it appears that Pataliputra, if at all captured, was not held as the expedition was forced to retreat, probably due to wars in their own territories.

The important Bactrian king Eucratides seems to have attacked the Indo-Greek kingdom during the mid 2nd century BC. A Demetrius, called "King of the Indians", seems to have confronted Eucratides in a four-month siege, reported by Justin, but he ultimately lost.&lt;ref name="autogenerated201"&gt;"Justin refers to an incident in which Eucratides with a small force of 300 was besieged for four months by "Demetrius, king of the Indians" with a large army of 60,000. The numbers are obviously an exaggeration. Eucratides managed to break out and went on to conquer India."

It is uncertain who this Demetrius was, and when the siege happened. Some scholars believe that it was Demetrius I."(Demetrius I) was probably the Demetrius who besieged Eucratides for four months", D.W. Mac Dowall, p.201-202, ''Afghanistan, ancien carrefour entre l'est et l'ouest''. This analysis goes against Bopearachchi, who has suggested that Demetrius I died long before Eucratides came to power.&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, Eucratides seems to have occupied territory as far as the [[Indus river|Indus]], between ca. 170 BC and 150 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bopearachchi, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; His advances were ultimately reclaimed by the Indo-Greek king [[Menander I]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"&gt;"As Bopearachchi has shown, Menander was able to regroup and take back the territory that Eucratides I had conquered, perhaps after Eucratides had died (1991, pp. 84–6). Bopearachchi demonstrates that the transition in Menander's coin designs were in response to changes introduced by Eucratides".&lt;/ref&gt;

Menander is considered to have been probably the most successful Indo-Greek king, and the conqueror of the largest territory.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;"Numismats and historians are unanimous in considering that Menander was one of the greatest, if not the greatest, and the most famous of the Indo-Greek kings. The coins to the name of Menander are incomparably more abundant than those of any other Indo-Greek king" [[Bopearachchi]], "Monnaies Gréco-Bactriennes et Indo-Grecques", p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The finds of his coins are the most numerous and the most widespread of all the Indo-Greek kings. Menander is also remembered in Buddhist literature, where he is called Milinda, and is described in the [[Milinda Panha]] as a convert to [[Buddhism]] he became an [[arhat]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated378"&gt;"(In the Milindapanha) Menander is declared an arhat", McEvilley, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; whose relics were enshrined in a manner reminiscent of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="autogenerated377"&gt;"Plutarch, who talks of the burial of Menander's relics under monuments or stupas, had obviously read or heard some Buddhist account of the Greek king's death", McEvilley, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated123"&gt;"The statement of Plutarch that when Menander died "the cities celebrated (...) agreeing that they should divide ashes equally and go away and should erect monuments to him in all their cities", is significant and reminds one of the story of the Buddha", Narain, "The Indo-Greeks" 2003, p. 123, "This is unmistakably Buddhist and recalls the similar situation at the time of the Buddha's passing away", Narain, "The Indo-Greeks" 2003, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; He also introduced a new coin type, with [[Athena]] Alkidemos ("Protector of the people") on the reverse, which was adopted by most of his successors in the East.&lt;ref&gt;Bopearachchi, "Monnaies", p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Menander his empire was greatly reduced due to the emergence of new kingdoms and republics within his allotted territories within India.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; The most eminent entities to splinter were the [[Yaudheya]] Republic and the [[Arjunayanas]], which began to mint coins mentioning military victories. Along with numismatic evidence, the [[Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman]] details the conquests of the Saka King [[Rudradaman I]] of the [[Western Satraps]] over the Yaudheya Republic, reaffirming their independence from the Menanders Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Rudradaman (...) who by force destroyed the Yaudheyas who were loath to submit, rendered proud as they were by having manifested their' title of' heroes among all Kshatriyas.
— Junagadh rock inscription&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From the mid-2nd century BC, the [[Indo-Scythians|Scythians]], in turn being pushed forward by the [[Yuezhi]] who were completing a long migration from the border of [[China]], started to invade Bactria from the north.&lt;ref name="autogenerated372"&gt;"By about 130 BC nomadic people from the Jaxartes region had overrun the northern boundary of Bactria itself", McEvilley, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 130 BC the last Greco-Bactrian king [[Heliocles]] was probably killed during the invasion and the Greco-Bactrian kingdom proper ceased to exist. The [[Parthia]]ns also probably played a role in the downfall of the Bactrian kingdom.

There are however no historical recordings of events in the Indo-Greek kingdom after Menander's death around 130 BC, since the Indo-Greeks had now become very isolated from the rest of the Graeco-Roman world. The later history of the Indo-Greek states, which lasted to around the shift BC/AD, is reconstructed almost entirely from archaeological and numismatical analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Senior, ''Indo-Scythian coins and history IV'', p.xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western accounts====
Greek presence in [[Arachosia]], where Greek populations had been living since before the acquisition of the territory by [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] from [[Seleucus I|Seleucus]], is mentioned by [[Isidore of Charax]]. He describes Greek cities there, one of them called Demetrias, probably in honour of the conqueror [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 1st century BC, the geographer [[Isidorus of Charax]] mentions [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] ruling over Greek populations and cities in [[Arachosia]]: "Beyond is Arachosia. And the Parthians call this White India; there are the city of Biyt and the city of Pharsana and the city of Chorochoad and the city of Demetrias; then Alexandropolis, the metropolis of Arachosia; it is Greek, and by it flows the river Arachotus. As far as this place the land is under the rule of the Parthians." "Parthians stations", 1st century BC. Mentioned in Bopearachchi, "Monnaies Greco-Bactriennes et Indo-Grecques", p52. Original text in paragraph 19 of [http://www.parthia.com/parthian_stations.htm#PARTHIAN_STATIONS Parthian stations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollodotus I (and Menander I) were mentioned by [[Pompeius Trogus]] as important Indo-Greek kings.&lt;ref&gt;Pompeius Trogus, Prologue to Book XLI.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is theorized that Greek advances temporarily went as far as the Shunga capital [[Pataliputra]] (today [[Patna, India|Patna]]) in eastern India. Senior considers that these conquests can only refer to Menander:&lt;ref&gt;"When Strabo mentions that "Those who after Alexander advanced beyond the Hypanis to the Ganges and Polibothra (Pataliputra)" this can only refer to the conquests of Menander.", Senior, ''Indo-Scythian coins and history'', p.XIV&lt;/ref&gt; Against this, John Mitchener considers that the Greeks probably raided the Indian capital of [[Pataliputra]] during the time of Demetrius,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchener, ''The Yuga Purana'', 2000, p.65: "In line with the above discussion, therefore, we may infer that such an event (the incursions to Pataliputra) took place, after the reign of Shalishuka Maurya (c.200 BC) and before that of Pushyamitra Shunga (187 BC). This would accordingly place the Yavana incursions during the reign of the Indo-Greek kings Euthydemus (c.230–190 BC) or Demetrios (c.205-190 as co-regent, and 190–171 BC as supreme ruler".&lt;/ref&gt; though Mitchener's analysis is not based on numismatic evidence.

{{quote|Of the eastern parts of India, then, there have become known to us all those parts which lie this side of the [[Beas River|Hypanis]], and also any parts beyond the Hypanis of which an account has been added by those who, after Alexander, advanced beyond the Hypanis, to the [[Ganges]] and [[Pataliputra]].|[[Strabo]], 15-1-27&lt;ref&gt;According to Tarn, the word used for "advance" (Proelonthes) can only mean a military expedition.

[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;query=head%3D%23118 Strabo 15-1-27]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McEvilley 371"/&gt;}}

The seriousness of the attack is in some doubt: Menander may merely have joined a raid led by Indian Kings down the [[Ganges River|Ganges]],&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Narain and Keay 2000&lt;/ref&gt; as Indo-Greek presence has not been confirmed this far east.

To the south, the Greeks may have occupied the areas of the [[Sindh]] and [[Gujarat]], including the strategic harbour of Barygaza ([[Bharuch]]),&lt;ref&gt;"Menander became the ruler of a kingdom extending along the coast of western India, including the whole of [[Saraostus|Saurashtra]] and the harbour [[Bharuch|Barukaccha]]. His territory also included Mathura, the Punjab, Gandhara and the Kabul Valley", Bussagli p101)&lt;/ref&gt; conquests also attested by coins dating from the Indo-Greek ruler [[King Apollodotus I|Apollodotus I]] and by several ancient writers (Strabo 11; [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], Chap. 41/47):&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, p.147-149&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Greeks... took possession, not only of [[Patalene]], but also, on the rest of the coast, of what is called the kingdom of [[Saraostus]] and [[Sigerdis]].|Strabo 11.11.1&lt;ref&gt;Strabo on the extent of the conquests of the Greco-Bactrians/Indo-Greeks: "They took possession, not only of [[Patalene|Patalena]], but also, on the rest of the coast, of what is called the kingdom of [[Saraostus]] and [[Sigerdis]]. In short, Apollodorus says that Bactriana is the ornament of [[Ariana]] as a whole; and, more than that, they extended their empire even as far as the [[Seres]] and the [[Phryni]]." Strabo 11.11.1 ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+11.11.1 Strabo 11.11.1])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Periplus'' further explains ancient Indo-Greek rule and continued circulation of Indo-Greek coinage in the region:
{{quote|"To the present day ancient drachmae are current in [[Barygaza]], coming from this country, bearing inscriptions in Greek letters, and the devices of those who reigned after Alexander, [[Apollodotus II|Apollodorus]] {{sic}} and [[Menander I|Menander]]."|Periplus Chap. 47&lt;ref name="sourcebook"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html Full text, Schoff's 1912 translation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Narain however dismisses the account of the Periplus as "just a sailor's story", and holds that coin finds are not necessarily indicators of occupation.&lt;ref&gt;"the account of the Periplus is just a sailor's story", Narain (p.118-119)&lt;/ref&gt; Coin hoards further suggest that in Central India, the area of [[Malwa]] may also have been conquered.&lt;ref&gt;"A distinctive series of Indo-Greek coins has been found at several places in central India: including at Dewas, some 22&amp;nbsp;miles to the east of [[Ujjain]]. These therefore add further definite support to the likelihood of an Indo-Greek presence in Malwa" Mitchener, "The Yuga Purana", p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rule in Mathura====
[[File:Yavanarajya_inscription.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Yavanarajya inscription]] discovered in [[Mathura]], mentions its carving on "The last day of year 116 of Yavana hegemony" (''Yavanarajya''), or 116th year if the [[Yavana era]], suggesting the Greeks ruled over Mathura as late as 60 BC.&lt;ref name="Rhie"/&gt; [[Mathura Museum]].]]

From numismatic, literary and epigraphic evidence, it seems that the [[Indo-Greeks]] also had control over [[Mathura]] at some time, especially during the rule of [[Menander I]] (165–135 BC).&lt;ref name="Rhie"/&gt;

An inscription in Mathura discovered in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Published in "L'Indo-Grec Menandre ou Paul Demieville revisite," Journal Asiatique 281 (1993) p.113&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Yavanarajya inscription]], mentions "The last day of year 116 of Yavana hegemony (''Yavanarajya'')". The "Yavanarajya" probably refers to the rule of the Indo-Greeks in Mathura as late as around 70-60 BC (year 116 of the [[Yavana era]]).&lt;ref name="Rhie"&gt;History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE, Sonya Rhie Quintanilla, BRILL, 2007, p.8-10 [https://books.google.com/books?id=X7Cb8IkZVSMC&amp;pg=PA8]&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of Indo-Greek rule in Mathura has been disputed, but it is also known that no remains of Sunga rule have been found in Mathura,&lt;ref name="Rhie"/&gt; and their territorial control is only proved as far as the central city of [[Ayodhya]] in northern central India, through the [[Dhanadeva-Ayodhya inscription]].&lt;ref name="NA"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&amp;pg=PA169 Ancient Indian History and Civilization, Sailendra Nath Sen, New Age International, 1999, p.169]&lt;/ref&gt; Archeological excavations of cast die-struck coins have also revealed the presence of a [[Mitra dynasty]] (coin issuers who did not name themselves "kings" on their coins) in Mathura sometime between 150 BC to 20 BC.&lt;ref name="Rhie"/&gt; Additionally, coins belonging to a [[Datta dynasty]] have also been excavated in Mathura. Whether these dynasties ruled independently or as satraps to larger kingdoms is unknown.

Mathura may then have been conquered by the [[Mitra dynasty]], or ruled  independently by the [[Datta dynasty]] during the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref name="autogenerated170"&gt;History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE, Sonya Rhie Quintanilla, BRILL, 2007, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; In any case Mathura was under the control of the [[Indo-Scythian]] [[Northern Satraps]] from the 1st century CE. 

=====Indian sources=====
Various Indian records describe ''[[Yavana]]'' attacks on [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], [[Panchala]], [[Saketa]], and [[Pataliputra]]. The term ''Yavana'' is thought to be a transliteration of "Ionians" and is known to have designated Hellenistic Greeks (starting with the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], where [[Ashoka]] writes about "the ''Yavana'' king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochus]]"),&lt;ref&gt;"Because the Ionians were either the first or the most dominant group among the Greeks with whom people in the east came in contact, the Persians called all of them ''Yauna'', and the Indians used ''Yona'' and ''Yavana'' for them", Narain, ''The Indo-Greeks'', p.249&lt;/ref&gt; but may have sometimes referred to other foreigners as well after the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;"The term (Yavana) had a precise meaning until well into the [[Christian era]], when gradually its original meaning was lost and, like the word Mleccha, it degenerated into a general term for a foreigner" Narain, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patanjali]], a grammarian and commentator on [[Pāṇini]] around 150 BC, describes in the ''[[Mahābhāṣya|Mahābhāsya]]'', the invasion in two examples using the imperfect tense of [[Sanskrit]], denoting a recent event:&lt;ref&gt;"Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian and Indo-Parthian coins in the Smithsonian institution", [[Bopearachchi]], p16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, p.145-146&lt;/ref&gt;

* "''Arunad Yavano Madhyamikām''" ("The Yavanas were besieging [[Nagari, Rajasthan|Madhyamika]]" (the "Middle country")).

Also the Brahmanical text of the ''[[Yuga Purana]]'', which describes Indian historical events in the form of a prophecy, but is thought to be likely historical,&lt;ref&gt;"But the real story of the Indo-Greek invasion becomes clear only on the analysis of the material contained in the historical section of the Gargi Samhita, the Yuga Purana" Narain, p110, ''The Indo-Greeks''.

Accounts of battles between the Greeks and the Shunga in [[Central India]] are also found in the ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram]]'', a play by [[Kālidāsa]] which is thought to describe an encounter between a Greek cavalry squadron and [[Vasumitra]], the grandson of [[Pushyamitra]], during the latter's reign, by the [[Sindh River]] or the [[Kali Sindh River]].&lt;ref&gt;"Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian and Indo-Parthian coins in the Smithsonian institution", [[Bopearachchi]], p16. Also: "Kalidasa recounts in his Mālavikāgnimitra (5.15.14–24) that [[Pushyamitra Shunga|Puspamitra]] appointed his grandson Vasumitra to guard his sacrificial horse, which wandered on the right bank of the Sindhu river and was seized by Yavana cavalrymen- the later being thereafter defeated by Vasumitra. The "Sindhu" referred to in this context may refer the river [[Indus River|Indus]]: but such an extension of Shunga power seems unlikely, and it is more probable that it denotes one of two rivers in central India -either the Sindhu river which is a tributary of the [[Yamuna]], or the Kali-Sindhu river which is a tributary of the [[Chambal River|Chambal]]." The Yuga Purana, Mitchener, 2002.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Yuga Purana, the Yavanas thereafter retreated following internal conflicts:
{{quote|"The Yavanas (Greeks) will command, the Kings will disappear. (But ultimately) the Yavanas, intoxicated with fighting, will not stay in Madhadesa (the [[Madhya Pradesh|Middle Country]]); there will be undoubtedly a civil war among them, arising in their own country ([[Bactria]]), there will be a terrible and ferocious war." (Gargi-Samhita, Yuga Purana chapter, No7).&lt;ref name="Chakrbarti"/&gt;}}

Earlier authors such as Tarn have suggested that the raid on Pataliputra was made by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mitchener, the [[Hathigumpha inscription]] indicates the presence of the Greeks led by a "Demetrius" in eastern India ([[Magadha]]) during the 1st century BC,&lt;ref&gt;"The name Dimita is almost certainly an adaptation of "Demetrios", and the inscription thus indicates a Yavana presence in Magadha, probably around the middle of the 1st century BC." Mitchener, ''The Yuga Purana'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; although this interpretation was previously disputed by Narain.&lt;ref&gt;"The Hathigumpha inscription seems to have nothing to do with the history of the Indo-Greeks; certainly it has nothing to do with Demetrius I", Narain, ''The Indo-Greeks'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"Then in the eighth year, ([[Kharavela]]) with a large army having sacked Goradhagiri causes pressure on Rajagaha ([[Rajgir|Rajagriha]]). On account of the loud report of this act of valour, the Yavana (Greek) King Dimi[ta] retreated to [[Mathura]] having extricated his demoralized army."|[[Hathigumpha inscription]], line 8, probably in the 1st century BCE. Original text is in Brahmi script.&lt;ref name="archive87"&gt;Translation in Epigraphia Indica 1920 [https://archive.org/details/epigrahiaindicav014769mbp p.87]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But while this inscription may be interpreted as an indication that Demetrius I was the king who made conquests in Punjab, it is still true that he never issued any Indian-standard coins, only numerous coins with elephant symbolism, and the restoration of his name in Kharosthi on the Hathigumpha inscription: ''Di-Mi-Ta'', has been doubted.&lt;ref&gt;P.L.Gupta: Kushâna Coins and History, D.K.Printworld, 1994, p.184, note 5&lt;/ref&gt; The ''"Di"'' is a reconstruction, and it may be noted that the name of another Indo-Greek king, Amyntas, is spelt ''A-Mi-Ta'' in Kharosthi and may fit in.

Therefore, Menander remains the likeliest candidate for any advance east of Punjab.

The important Bactrian king Eucratides seems to have attacked the Indo-Greek kingdom during the mid 2nd century BC. A Demetrius, called "King of the Indians", seems to have confronted Eucratides in a four-month siege, reported by Justin, but he ultimately lost.&lt;ref name="autogenerated201"/&gt;

In any case, Eucratides seems to have occupied territory as far as the [[Indus river|Indus]], between ca. 170 BC and 150 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bopearachchi, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; His advances were ultimately checked by the Indo-Greek king [[Menander I]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"/&gt;

Menander is considered to have been probably the most successful Indo-Greek king, and the conqueror of the largest territory.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The finds of his coins are the most numerous and the most widespread of all the Indo-Greek kings. Menander is also remembered in Buddhist literature, where he is called Milinda, and is described in the [[Milinda Panha]] as a convert to [[Buddhism]]:&lt;ref&gt;"Menander, the probable conqueror of Pataliputra, seems to have been a Buddhist, and his name belongs in the list of important royal patrons of Buddhism along with Ashoka and Kanishka", McEvilley, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; he became an [[arhat]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated378"/&gt; whose relics were enshrined in a manner reminiscent of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="autogenerated377"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated123"/&gt; He also introduced a new coin type, with [[Athena]] Alkidemos ("Protector of the people") on the reverse, which was adopted by most of his successors in the East.&lt;ref&gt;Bopearachchi, "Monnaies", p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fall of Bactria and death of Menander==== 
[[File:Heliocles_I_helmetted.jpg|thumb|[[Heliocles]] (145–130 BC) was the last Greek king in [[Bactria]].]]
From the mid-2nd century BC, the [[Indo-Scythians|Scythians]], in turn being pushed forward by the [[Yuezhi]] who were completing a long migration from the border of [[China]], started to invade Bactria from the north.&lt;ref name="autogenerated372"/&gt; Around 130 BC the last Greco-Bactrian king [[Heliocles]] was probably killed during the invasion and the Greco-Bactrian kingdom proper ceased to exist. The [[Parthia]]ns also probably played a role in the downfall of the Bactrian kingdom.

Immediately after the fall of Bactria, the bronze coins of Indo-Greek king [[Zoilos I]] (130–120 BC), successor of Menander in the western part of the Indian territories, combined the club of Herakles with a [[Scythian]]-type bowcase and short [[recurve bow]] inside a [[wreath|victory wreath]], illustrating interaction with horse-mounted people originating from the steppes, possibly either the Scythians (future [[Indo-Scythians]]), or the [[Yuezhi]] (future [[Kushans]]) who had invaded Greco-Bactria.&lt;ref name="google226"&gt;Boot, Hooves and Wheels: And the Social Dynamics behind South Asian Warfare, Saikat K Bose,
Vij Books India Pvt Ltd, 2015, p.226 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ywfsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT226]&lt;/ref&gt; This bow can be contrasted to the traditional Hellenistic long bow depicted on the coins of the eastern Indo-Greek queen [[Agathokleia]]. It is now known that 50 years later, the Indo-Scythian [[Maues]] was in alliance with the Indo-Greek kings in [[Taxila]], and one of those kings, [[Artemidoros Aniketos|Artemidoros]] seems to claim on his coins that he is the son of Maues,&lt;ref name="google101"&gt;On the Cusp of an Era: Art in the Pre-Kuṣāṇa World, Doris Srinivasan, BRILL, 2007, p.101 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuevCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101]&lt;/ref&gt; although this is now disputed.&lt;ref name="academia1"/&gt;

====Preservation of the Indo-Greek realm====
The extant of Indo-Greek rule is still uncertain and disputed. Probable members of the dynasty of Menander include the ruling queen [[Agathokleia]], her son [[Strato I]], and [[Nicias (Indo-Greek king)|Nicias]], though it is uncertain whether they ruled directly after Menander.&lt;ref&gt;Bopearachchi, ''Monnaies'', p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coin of Antialkidas.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Antialcidas]] (105–95 BC).]]
[[File:Coin of Philoxenos.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Philoxenus Anicetus|Philoxenos]] (100–95 BC).]]
Other kings emerged, usually in the western part of the Indo-Greek realm, such as [[Zoilos I]], [[King Lysias|Lysias]], [[Antialcidas]] and [[King Philoxenus|Philoxenos]].&lt;ref&gt;Senior, ''Indo-Scythian coins and history IV'', p.xi&lt;/ref&gt; These rulers may have been relatives of either the Eucratid or the Euthydemid dynasties. The names of later kings were often new (members of Hellenistic dynasties usually inherited family names) but old reverses and titles were frequently repeated by the later rulers.

[[File:Zoilos I coin alliance of the Heraklean club and the Scythian bow.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of [[Zoilos I]] (130–120 BC) showing on the reverse the [[Herakles|Heraklean]] club with the [[Scythian]] bow, inside a victory wreath.]]
Immediately after the fall of Bactria, the bronze coins of Indo-Greek king [[Zoilos I]] (130–120 BC), successor of Menander in the western part of the Indian territories, combined the club of Herakles with a [[Scythian]]-type bowcase and short [[recurve bow]] inside a [[wreath|victory wreath]], illustrating interaction with horse-mounted people originating from the steppes, possibly either the Scythians (future [[Indo-Scythians]]), or the [[Yuezhi]] (future [[Kushans]]) who had invaded Greco-Bactria.&lt;ref name="google226"/&gt; This bow can be contrasted to the traditional Hellenistic long bow depicted on the coins of the eastern Indo-Greek queen [[Agathokleia]].

While all Indo-Greek kings after [[Apollodotus I]] mainly issued bilingual (Greek and [[Kharoshti]]) coins for circulation in their own territories, several of them also struck rare Greek coins which have been found in Bactria. The later kings probably struck these coins as some kind of payment to the Scythian or Yuezhi tribes who now ruled there, though if as tribute or payment for mercenaries remains unknown.&lt;ref name = "Benard-p76"&gt;"P.Bernard thinks that these emissions were destined to commercial exchanges with Bactria, then controlled by the Yuezhi, and were post-Greek coins remained faithful to Greco-Bactrian coinage. In a slightly different perspective (...) G. Le Rider considers that these emission were used to pay tribute to the nomads of the north, who were thus incentivized not to pursue their forays in the direction of the Indo-Greek realm", Bopearachchi, "Monnaies", p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; For some decades after the Bactrian invasion, relationships seem to have been peaceful between the Indo-Greeks and these relatively hellenised nomad tribes.

;Vidisha
It is around this time, in 115 BC, that the embassy of [[Heliodurus|Heliodorus]], from king [[Antialkidas]] to the court of the [[Sungas]] king [[Bhagabhadra]] in [[Vidisha]], is recorded. In the Sunga capital, Heliodorus established the [[Heliodorus pillar]] in a dedication to [[Vāsudeva]]. This would indicate that relations between the Indo-Greeks and the Sungas had improved by that time, that people traveled between the two realms, and also that the Indo-Greeks readily followed Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Indian History and Civilization, Sailendra Nath Sen, New Age International, 1999 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&amp;pg=PA170 p.170]&lt;/ref&gt;

A warrior figure, the [[Bharhut Yavana]], appeared prominently on a [[high relief]] on the railings of the stupa of [[Bharhut]] circa 100 BC.&lt;ref name="Boardman 112"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Didactic Narration: Jataka Iconography in Dunhuang with a Catalogue of Jataka Representations in China, Alexander Peter Bell, LIT Verlag Münster, 2000 [https://books.google.com/books?id=77hHrXX4COgC&amp;pg=PA18 p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; The warrior has the flowing head band of a Greek king, a northern tunic with Hellenistic [[pleat]]s, he hold a grape in his hand, and has a Buddhist [[triratana]] symbol on his sword.&lt;ref name="Boardman 112"/&gt; He has the role of a [[dvarapala]], a Guardian of the entrance of the Stupa. The warrior has been described as a [[Indo-Greek|Greek]],&lt;ref name="Boardman 112"&gt;"The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity, John Boardman, 1993, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that he might even represent king [[Menander I|Menander]].&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OH"/&gt;

Also around that time, craftsmen from the [[Gandhara]] area are known to have been involved in the construction of the Buddhist [[torana]] gateways at [[Bharhut]], which are dated to 100-75 BC:&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture, Huu Phuoc Le, Grafikol, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA149 p.149ff]&lt;/ref&gt; this is because [[Stonemasonry|mason]]'s marks in [[Kharosthi]] have been found on several elements of the Bharhut remains, indicating that some of the builders at least came from the north, particularly from [[Gandhara]] where the Kharoshti script was in use.&lt;ref name="Boardman 115"&gt;The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity, John Boardman, Princeton University Press, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"There is evidence of Hellensitic sculptors being in touch with Sanchi and Bharhut" in The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development, Yuvraj Krishan, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDyJh--iaL0C&amp;pg=PA9 p.9]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture by Huu Phuoc Le [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA161 p.161]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cunningham explained that [[:File:Bharhut ballustrades with Kharoshti mason marks.jpg|the Kharosthi letters were found on the ballusters]] between the architraves of the gateway, but none on the railings which all had Indian markings, summarizing that the gateways, which are artistically more refined, must have been made by artists from the North, whereas the railings were made by local artists.&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;"These little balusters are of considerable interest, as their sculptured statues are much superior in artistic design and execution to those of the railing pillars. They are further remarkable in having Arian letters engraved on their bases or capitals, a peculiarity which points unmistakably to the employment of Western artists, and which fully accounts for the superiority of their execution. The letters found are p, s, a, and b, of which the first three occur twice. Now, if the same sculptors had been employed on the railings, we might confidently expect to find the same alphabetical letters used as private marks. But the fact is just the reverse, for the whole of the 27 marks found on any portions of the railing are Indian letters. The only conclusion that I can come to from these facts is that the foreign artists who were employed on the sculptures of the gateways were certainly not engaged on any part of the railing. I conclude, therefore, that the Raja of [[Sungas]], the donor of the gateways, must have sent his own party of workmen to make them, while the smaller gifts of pillars and rails were executed by the local artists." in The stūpa of Bharhut: a Buddhist monument ornamented with numerous sculptures illustrative of Buddhist legend and history in the third century B.

The men are depicted with short curly hair, often held together with a [[headband]] of the type commonly seen on [[Greek coins]]. The clothing too is Greek, complete with [[tunic]]s, capes and sandals, typical of the [[:File:Greek travelling costume.jpg|Greek travelling costume]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Greeks evidently introduced the himation and the chiton seen in the terracottas from Taxila and the short kilt worn by the soldier on the Sanchi relief." in Foreign influence on Indian culture: from c. 600 B.C. to 320 A.D., Manjari Ukil Originals, 2006, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; The musical instruments are also quite characteristic, such as the double flute called [[aulos]].

===Decline===
King [[Philoxenios|Philoxenus]] (100–95 BC) briefly occupied the whole Greek territory from the [[Paropamisadae]] to Western [[Punjab]], after what the territories fragmented again between smaller Indo-Greek kings. Throughout the 1st century BC, the Indo-Greeks progressively lost ground to the Indians in the east, and the [[Scythian]]s, the [[Yuezhi]], and the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] in the West. About 20 Indo-Greek kings are known during this period,&lt;ref&gt;"During the century that followed Menander more than twenty rulers are known to have struck coins", Narain, "The Indo-Greeks" 2003, p.270&lt;/ref&gt; down to the last known Indo-Greek rulers, [[Strato II]] and [[Strato III]], who ruled in the [[Punjab region]] until around 10 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard (1994), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loss of Hindu Kush territories (70 BC-)====
{{Main article|Yuezhi}}
[[File:Helmetted Hermaios.jpg|thumb|[[Hermaeus]] (90–70 BC) was the last Indo-Greek king in the Western territories ([[Paropamisadae]]).]]
[[File:Hermaios posthumous issue struck by Indo-Scythians near Kabul, circa 80-75 BCE.jpg|thumb|Hermaeus posthumous issue struck by [[Indo-Scythians]] near [[Kabul]], circa 80–75 BCE.]]
Around eight "western" Indo-Greek kings are known; most of them are distinguished by their issues of Attic coins for circulation in the neighbouring region.

One of the last important kings in the [[Paropamisadae]] (part of the [[Hindu Kush]]) was [[Hermaeus]], who ruled until around 80 BC; soon after his death the [[Yuezhi]] or [[Sakas]] took over his areas from neighbouring Bactria. When Hermaeus is depicted on his coins riding a horse, he is equipped with the [[recurve bow]] and bow-case of the steppes and RC Senior believes him to be of partly nomad origin. The later king [[Hippostratus]] may however also have held territories in the Paropamisadae.

After the death of Hermaeus, the Yuezhi or Saka nomads became the new rulers of the Paropamisadae, and minted vast quantities of posthumous issues of [[Hermaeus]] up to around 40 AD, when they blend with the coinage of the [[Kushan]] king [[Kujula Kadphises]].&lt;ref&gt;"Kujula Kadphises, founder of the Kushan Empire, succeeded there (in the Paropamisadae) to the nomads who minted imitations of Hermaeus" Bopearachchi, "Monnaies", p.117&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented Yuezhi prince, [[Sapadbizes]], ruled around 20 BC, and minted in Greek and in the same style as the western Indo-Greek kings, probably depending on Greek mints and celators.

====Loss of Central territories (48/47 BC)====
{{Main article|Indo-Scythians}}
[[File:Hippostratos.jpg|thumb|Tetradrachm of [[Hippostratos]], reigned circa 65–55 BC, was the last Indo-Greek king in [[Western Punjab]].]]
[[File:Coin of Azes I.jpg|thumb|Hippostratos was replaced by the [[Indo-Scythian]] king [[Azes I]] (r. c. 35–12 BC).]]
Around 80 BC, an [[Indo-Scythian]] king named [[Maues]], possibly a general in the service of the Indo-Greeks, ruled for a few years in northwestern India before the Indo-Greeks again took control. He seems to have been married to an Indo-Greek princess named Machene.&lt;ref&gt;"Maues himself issued joint coins with Machene, (...) probably a daughter of one of the Indo-Greek houses" Senior, ''Indo-Scythians'', p.xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Hippostratus]] (65–55 BC) seems to have been one of the most successful subsequent Indo-Greek kings until he lost to the Indo-Scythian [[Azes I]], who established an Indo-Scythian dynasty in 48/47 BC.&lt;ref&gt;G.K. Jenkins, using overstrikes and monograms, showed that, contrary to what Narai would write two years later, Apollodotus II and Hippostratus were posterior, by far, to Maues. (...) He reveals an overstike if Azes I over Hippostratus. (...) Apollodotus and Hippostratus are thus posterior to Maues and anterior to Azes I, whose era we now starts in 57 BC." Bopearachchi, p.126-127.&lt;/ref&gt; Various coins seem to suggest that some sort of alliance may have taken place between the Indo-Greeks and the Scythians.&lt;ref&gt;"It is curious that on his copper [[Zoilos]] used a bow and quiver as a type. A quiver was a badge used by the Parthians (Scythians) and had been used previously by Diodotos, who we know had made a treaty with them. Did Zoilos use Scythian mercenaries in his quest against Menander perhaps?" Senior, ''Indo-Scythian coins'', p.xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Indo-Scythians clearly ruled militarily and politically, they remained surprisingly respectful of Greek and Indian cultures. Their coins were minted in Greek mints, continued using proper Greek and Kharoshthi legends, and incorporated depictions of Greek deities, particularly Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;"The Indo-Scythian conquerors, who, also they adopted the Greek types, minted money with their own names". Bopearachchci, "Monnaies", p.121&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mathura lion capital]] inscription attests that they adopted the Buddhist faith, as do the depictions of deities forming the vitarka mudra on their coins. Greek communities, far from being exterminated, probably persisted under Indo-Scythian rule. There is a possibility that a fusion, rather than a confrontation, occurred between the Greeks and the Indo-Scythians: in a recently published coin, [[Artemidorus]] seems to present himself as "son of Maues"&lt;ref&gt;Described in R. C. Senior "The Decline of the Indo-Greeks" [http://www.onsnumis.org/news/0499newrecpubl.shtml]. See also [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp8/ot_indoscyth_20050802.html this source] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015203904/http://iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp8/ot_indoscyth_20050802.html |date=2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ( but this is now disputed),&lt;ref name="OB"&gt;[[Osmund Bopearachchi]], Catalogue raisonné, {{pp.|172-175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Buner reliefs]] show Indo-Greeks and Indo-Scythians reveling in a Buddhist context.

The last known mention of an Indo-Greek ruler is suggested by an inscription on a signet ring of the 1st century AD in the name of a king [[Theodamas]], from the [[Bajaur]] area of [[Gandhara]], in modern Pakistan. No coins of him are known, but the signet bears in [[kharoshthi]] script the inscription ''"Su Theodamasa"'', ''"Su"'' being explained as the Greek transliteration of the ubiquitous [[Kushan]] royal title ''"Shau"'' ("[[Shah]]", "King").&lt;ref&gt;"We get two Greeks of the Parthian period, the first half of the first century AD, who used the Indian form of their names, King Theodamas on his signet-ring found in Bajaur, and Thedorus son of Theoros on two silver bowls from Taxila." Tarn, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loss of Eastern territories (10 AD)====
[[File:Strato II East Punjab territory with capital in Sagala.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Approximate region of [[East Punjab]] and Strato II's capital [[Sagala]].]]
[[File:Strato II other coin.jpg|thumb|The last known Indo-Greek kings [[Strato II]] and [[Strato III]], here on a joint coin  (25 BC-10 AD), were the last Indo-Greek king in eartern territories of [[Eastern Punjab]].]]

The Indo-Greek kingdoms lost most of their eastern territories in the 1st century BCE following the death of Menander.&lt;ref&gt;"Most of the people east of the Ravi already noticed as within Menander's empire -Audumbaras, Trigartas, Kunindas, Yaudheyas, Arjunayanas- began to coins in the first century BC, which means that they had become independent kingdoms or republics.", Tarn, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arjunayana]]s and the  [[Yaudheya]] Republic mention military victories on their coins ("Victory of the Arjunayanas", "Victory of the Yaudheyas"). These entities would remain independamt until being conquered by the Saka King [[Rudradaman I]] of the [[Western Satraps]].
{{quote|Rudradaman (...) who by force destroyed the Yaudheyas who were loath to submit, rendered proud as they were by having manifested their' title of' heroes among all [[Kshatriyas]].|[[Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman]]}}
They would again win independence until being conquered by [[Samudragupta]] of the [[Gupta Empire]], and would disintegrate soon after. 

During the 1st century BC, the [[Trigarta Kingdom|Trigartas]], [[Audumbaras]]&lt;ref&gt;"The coinage of the former (the Audumbaras) to whom their trade was of importance, starts somewhere in the first century BC; they occasionally imitate the types of Demetrius and Apollodotus I", Tarn, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally the [[Kuninda]]s&lt;ref&gt;The Kunindas must have been included in the Greek empire, not only because of their geographical position, but because they started coining at the time which saw the end of Greek rule and the establishment of their independence", Tarn, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; also started to mint their own coins, usually in a style highly reminiscent of Indo-Greek coinage.&lt;ref&gt;"Further evidence of the commercial success of the Greek drachms is seen in the fact that they influenced the coinage of the Audumbaras and the Kunindas", Narain ''The Indo-Greeks'', p.114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The wealthy Audumbaras (...) some of their coins after Greek rule ended imitated Greek types", Tarn, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Later, in the first century a ruler of the Kunindas, Amogabhuti, issued a silver coinage "which would compete in the market with the later Indo-Greek silver"", Tarn, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yavanas may have ruled as far as the area of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] from the time of [[Menander I]] until the middle of the 1st century BC: the [[Yavanarajya inscription|Maghera inscription]], from a village near Mathura, records the dedication of a well "in the one hundred and sixteenth year of the [[Yavana era|reign of the Yavanas]]", which corresponds to circa 70 BC.&lt;ref&gt;The Sanskrit inscription reads "Yavanarajyasya sodasuttare varsasate 100 10 6". R.Salomon, "The Indo-Greek era of 186/5 B.C. in a Buddhist reliquary inscription", in "Afghanistan, ancien carrefour entre l'est et l'ouest", p373&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century BC, however, they lost the area of Mathura, either to the [[Mitra dynasty|Mitra rulers]] under the [[Shunga Empire]] or to  the [[Datta dynasty]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated170"/&gt;

Fleeing the Sakas in the west, the Indo-Greeks continued to rule a territory in the eastern Punjab. The kingdom of the last Indo-Greek kings [[Strato II]] and [[Strato III]] was conquered by the  [[Northern Satrap]] Saka ruler [[Rajuvula]] around 10 AD.&lt;ref&gt;"Around 10 AD, with the joint rule of Straton II and his son Straton in the area of Sagala, the last Greek kingdom succumbed to the attacks of Rajuvula, the Indo-Scythian satrap of Mathura.", Bopearachchi, "Monnaies", p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhist caves====
A large number of [[Buddhist caves in India]], particularly in the west of the country, were artistically hewn between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE. Numerous donors provided the funds for the building of these caves and left donatory inscriptions, including laity, members of the clergy, government officials. Foreigners, mostly self-declared ''[[Yavanas]]'', represented about 8% of all inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99 p.98-99]&lt;/ref&gt;

These contributions seem to have ended when the [[Satavahana]] King [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] vanquished the [[Western Satrap]] ruler [[Nahapana]], who had ruled over the area where these inscriptions were made, circa 130 CE. This victory is known from the fact that Gautamiputra Satakarni restruck many of Nahapana's coins, and that he is claimed to have defeated a confederacy of [[Shakas]] ([[Western Kshatrapas]]), [[Pahlavas]] ([[Indo-Parthian Kingdom|Indo-Parthians]]), and [[Yavana]]s (Indo-Greeks), in the inscription of his mother Queen Gotami Balasiri at Cave No.3 of the [[Nasik caves]]:&lt;ref&gt;Upinder Singh (2008).

====Yavana era for Buddha sculptures====
[[File:Loriya Tangai Buddha.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Statue with inscription mentioning "year 318", probably of the [[Yavana era]], ie 143 CE.&lt;ref name="PC"/&gt;]]
Several [[Gandhara]] Buddha statues with dated inscriptions, are now thought to have been dated in the [[Yavana era]] (originating circa 186 BCE). One of the statues of the Buddha from [[Loriyan Tangai]] has an inscription mentioning "the year 318". The era in question is not specified, but it is now thought, following the discovery of the [[Bajaur reliquary inscription]] and a suggestion by [[Richard G. Salomon (academic)|Richard Salomon]] which has gained wide acceptance,&lt;ref&gt;Problems of Chronology in Gandharan Art [http://www.carc.ox.ac.uk/PublicFiles/media/Final%20e-version%20Problems%20of%20Chronology%20in%20Gandharan%20Art.pdf p.39]&lt;/ref&gt; that it is dated in the Yavana era beginning in 186 BCE, and gives a date for the Buddha statue of about 143 CE.&lt;ref name = "PC"&gt;[http://www.carc.ox.ac.uk/PublicFiles/media/Final%20e-version%20Problems%20of%20Chronology%20in%20Gandharan%20Art.pdf Problems of Chronology in Gandharan Art, Juhyung Rhi, pp.35-51, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hashtnagar Buddha piedestal with Year 384 inscription.jpg|thumb|left|Piedestal of the [[Hashtnagar]] Buddha statue, with Year 384 inscription, probably of the Yavana era, ie 209 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Problems of Chronology in Gandharan Art [http://www.carc.ox.ac.uk/PublicFiles/media/Final%20e-version%20Problems%20of%20Chronology%20in%20Gandharan%20Art.pdf p.37]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The inscription at the base of the statue is:

{{quote|
''sa 1 1 1 100 10 4 4 Prothavadasa di 20 4 1 1 1 Budhagosa danamu(khe) Saghorumasa sadaviyasa''
"In year 318, the day 27 of Prausthapada, gift of Buddhaghosa, the companion of Samghavarma" | Inscription of the Buddha of Loriyan Tangai.&lt;ref name = "PC"/&gt;}}

This would make it one of the earliest known representations of the Buddha, after the [[Bimaran casket]] (1st century CE), and at about the same time as the Buddhist coins of [[Kanishka]].&lt;ref name = "PC"/&gt;

Another statue of Buddha, the Buddha of [[Hashtnagar]], is inscribed from the year 384, also probably in the Yavana era, which is thought to be 209 CE. Only the pedestal is preserved in the [[British Museum]], the statue itself, with folds of clothing having more relief than those of the Loriyan Tangai Buddha, having disappeared.&lt;ref name = "PC"/&gt;

==Ideology==
[[File:Evolution of Zeus Nikephoros on Indo-Greek coinage.jpg|thumb|400px|Evolution of ''Zeus Nikephoros'' ("[[Zeus]] holding [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]") on Indo-Greek coinage: from the Classical motif of Nike handing the [[wreath]] of victory to Zeus himself (left, coin of [[Heliocles I]] 145–130 BC), then to a baby [[elephant]] (middle, coin of [[Antialcidas]] 115–95 BC), and then to the [[Dharmachakra|Wheel of the Law]], symbol of [[Buddhism]] (right, coin of [[Menander II]] 90–85 BC).]] 
Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek kings, and their rule, especially that of Menander, has been remembered as benevolent. It has been suggested, although direct evidence is lacking, that their invasion of India was intended to show their support for the [[Mauryan empire]] which may have had a long history of marital alliances,&lt;ref&gt;Marital alliances:
*Discussion on the dynastic alliance in Tarn, pp. 152–153: "It has been recently suggested that Ashoka was grandson of the Seleucid princess, whom [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] gave in marriage to [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]]. Should this far-reaching suggestion be well founded, it would not only throw light on the good relations between the Seleucid and Maurya dynasties, but would mean that the Maurya dynasty was descended from, or anyhow connected with, Seleucus... when the Mauryan line became extinct, he (Demetrius) may well have regarded himself, if not as the next heir, at any rate as the heir nearest at hand". Also: "The Seleucid and Maurya lines were connected by the marriage of Seleucus' daughter (or niece) either to Chandragupta or his son Bindusara" [[John Marshall]], Taxila, p20. This thesis originally appeared in "The Cambridge Shorter History of India": "If the usual oriental practice was followed and if we regard Chandragupta as the victor, then it would mean that a daughter or other female relative of Seleucus was given to the Indian ruler or to one of his sons, so that Ashoka may have had Greek blood in his veins." The Cambridge Shorter History of India, J. Allan, H. H. Dodwell, T. Wolseley Haig, p33 [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=88816404 Source].
*Description of the 302 BC marital alliance in [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;query=head%3D%23120 Strabo 15.2.1(9)]: "The Indians occupy [[in part]] some of the countries situated along the Indus, which formerly belonged to the Persians: Alexander deprived the Ariani of them, and established there settlements of his own. But [[Seleucus Nicator]] gave them to [[Sandrocottus]] in consequence of a marriage contract, and received in return five hundred elephants." The ambassador [[Megasthenes]] was also sent to the Mauryan court on this occasion.&lt;/ref&gt; exchange of presents,&lt;ref&gt;Exchange of presents:
*Classical sources have recorded that Chandragupta sent various [[aphrodisiac]]s to Seleucus: "And Theophrastus says that some contrivances are of wondrous efficacy in such matters [[as to make people more amorous]]. And Phylarchus confirms him, by reference to some of the presents which Sandrakottus, the king of the Indians, sent to Seleucus; which were to act like charms in producing a wonderful degree of affection, while some, on the contrary, were to banish love" [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]], "[[The deipnosophists]]" Book I, chapter 32 [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature000701860036&amp;isize=M&amp;pview=hide Ath. Deip. I.32]
*[[Ashoka]] claims he introduced herbal medicine in the territories of the Greeks, for the welfare of humans and animals (Edict No2).
*[[Bindusara]] asked [[Antiochus I]] to send him some sweet [[wine]], dried [[figs]] and a [[sophist]]: "But dried figs were so very much sought after by all men (for really, as [[Aristophanes]] says, "There's really nothing nicer than dried figs"), that even Amitrochates, the king of the Indians, wrote to [[Antiochus I Soter|Antiochus]], entreating him (it is [[Hegesander (historian)|Hegesander]] who tells this story) to buy and send him some sweet wine, and some dried figs, and a [[sophist]]; and that Antiochus wrote to him in answer, "The dry figs and the sweet wine we will send you; but it is not lawful for a sophist to be sold in Greece" [[Athenaeus]], "[[Deipnosophistae]]" XIV.67 [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=goto&amp;id=Literature.AthV3&amp;isize=M&amp;page=1044 Athenaeus, "Deipnosophistae" XIV.67]&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrations of friendship,&lt;ref&gt;Treaties of friendship:
*When [[Antiochos III]], after having made peace with [[Euthydemus I|Euthydemus]], went to India in 209 BC, he is said to have renewed his friendship with the Indian king there and received presents from him: "He crossed the Caucasus ([[Hindu Kush]]) and descended into India; renewed his friendship with [[Sophagasenus]] the king of the Indians; received more elephants, until he had a hundred and fifty altogether; and having once more provisioned his troops, set out again personally with his army: leaving Androsthenes of Cyzicus the duty of taking home the treasure which this king had agreed to hand over to him."[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+11.39 Polybius 11.39]&lt;/ref&gt; exchange of ambassadors&lt;ref&gt;Ambassadors:
*Known ambassadors to India are [[Megasthenes]], [[Deimakos]] and [[Dionysius (ambassador)|Dionysius]].&lt;/ref&gt; and religious missions&lt;ref&gt;Religious missions:
*In the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], king [[Ashoka]] claims to have sent Buddhist emissaries to the Hellenistic west around 250 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Greeks. The historian [[Diodorus]] even wrote that the king of Pataliputra had "great love for the Greeks".&lt;ref&gt;
The historian [[Diodorus]] wrote that the king of [[Pataliputra]], apparently a Mauryan king, "loved the Greeks": "Iambulus, having found his way to a certain village, was then brought by the natives into the presence of the king of Palibothra, a city which was distant a journey of many days from the sea. And since the king loved the Greeks ("Philhellenos") and devoted to learning he considered Iambulus worthy of cordial welcome; and at length, upon receiving a permission of safe-conduct, he passed over first of all into Persia and later arrived safe in Greece" Diodorus ii,60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Diodorus testifies to the great love of the king of Palibothra, apparently a Mauryan king, for the Greeks" Narain, "The Indo-Greeks", p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Greek expansion into Indian territory may have been intended to protect Greek populations in India,&lt;ref&gt;"Obviously, for the Greeks who survived in India and suffered from the oppression of the Shunga (for whom they were aliens and heretics), Demetrios must have appeared as a saviour" Mario Bussagli, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; and to protect the Buddhist faith from the religious persecutions of the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"We can now, I think, see what the Greek 'conquest' meant and how the Greeks were able to traverse such extraordinary distances. To parts of India, perhaps to large parts, they came, not as conquerors, but as friends or 'saviours'; to the Buddhist world in particular they appeared to be its champions" (Tarn, p. 180)&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Sirkap]] founded by Demetrius combines Greek and Indian influences without signs of segregation between the two cultures.

The first Greek coins to be minted in India, those of [[Menander I]] and [[King Apollodotus I|Apollodotus I]] bear the mention "Saviour king" (ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΣΩΤΗΡΟΣ), a title with high value in the Greek world which indicated an important deflective victory. For instance, [[Ptolemy I]] had been ''Soter'' (saviour) because he had helped save [[Rhodes]] from [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius the Besieger]], and [[Antiochus I]] because he had saved [[Asia Minor]] from the [[Gauls]]. The title was also inscribed in Pali as ("Tratarasa") on the reverse of their coins. Menander and Apollodotus may indeed have been saviours to the Greek populations residing in India, and to some of the Indians as well.&lt;ref&gt;Tarn p. 175. Also: "The people to be 'saved' were in fact usually Buddhists, and the common enmity of Greek and Buddhists to the Sunga king threw them into each other's arms", Tarn p. 175. "Menander was coming to save them from the oppression of the Sunga kings", Tarn p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, most of the coins of the Greek kings in India were bilingual, written in Greek on the front and in [[Pāli|Pali]] on the back (in the [[Kharosthi]] script, derived from [[Aramaic]], rather than the more eastern [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]], which was used only once on coins of [[Agathocles of Bactria]]), a tremendous concession to another culture never before made in the Hellenic world.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, "Indo-Greek coins", p 3-8&lt;/ref&gt; From the reign of [[Apollodotus II]], around 80 BC, Kharosthi letters started to be used as mintmarks on coins in combination with Greek monograms and mintmarks, suggesting the participation of local technicians to the minting process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bopearachchi]] p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, these bilingual coins of the Indo-Greeks were the key in the [[decipherment]] of the Kharoshthi script by [[James Prinsep]] (1799–1840).&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Kharoshthi became extinct around the 3rd century AD.

In Indian literature, the Indo-Greeks are described as [[Yavana]]s (in [[Sanskrit]]),&lt;ref&gt;"These Indo-Greeks were called Yavanas in ancient Indian literature" p.9 + note 1 "The term had a precise meaning until well into the Christian era, when gradually its original meaning was lost and, like the word ''Mleccha'', it degenerated into a general term for a foreigner" p.18, Narain "The Indo-Greeks"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"All Greeks in India were however known as Yavanas", Burjor Avari, "India, the ancient past", p.130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The term Yavana may well have been first applied by the Indians to the Greeks of various cities of Asia Minor who were settled in the areas contiguous to north-west India" Narain "The Indo-Greeks", p.227&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Yona]]s (in [[Pali]])&lt;ref&gt;"Of the Sanskrit Yavana, there are other forms and derivatives, viz. Yona, Yonaka, Javana, Yavana, Jonon or Jononka, Ya-ba-na etc... Yona is a normal Prakrit form from Yavana", Narain "The Indo-Greeks", p.228&lt;/ref&gt; both thought to be transliterations of "[[Ionians]]". In the Harivamsa the "Yavana" Indo-Greeks are qualified, together with the [[Sakas]], [[Kambojas]], Pahlavas and Paradas as ''Kshatriya-pungava'' i.e. foremost among the Warrior caste, or [[Kshatriyas]]. The [[Majjhima Nikaya]] explains that in the lands of the Yavanas and Kambojas, in contrast with the numerous Indian castes, there were only two classes of people, [[Arya]]s and [[Dasa]]s (masters and slaves).

In addition to the worship of the Classical [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of the Greek deities found on their coins ([[Zeus]], [[Herakles]], [[Athena]], [[Apollo]]...), the Indo-Greeks were involved with local faiths, particularly with Buddhism, but also with Hinduism and Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, p. 391: "Somewhere I have met with the zhole-hearted statement that every Greek in India ended by becoming a Buddhist (...) Heliodorus the ambassador was a Bhagavatta, a worshiper of Vshnu-Krishna as the supreme deity (...) Theodorus the meridrarch, who established some relics of the Buddha "for the purpose of the security of many people", was undoubtedly Buddhist". Images of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] divinity [[Mithra]] – depicted with a radiated [[phrygian cap]] – appear extensively on the Indo-Greek coinage of the Western kings. This Zeus-Mithra is also the one represented seated (with the gloriole around the head, and a small protrusion on the top of the head representing the cap) on many coins of [[Hermaeus]], [[Antialcidas]] or [[Heliokles II]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactions with Buddhism===
[[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]], conquered the Greek satraps left by Alexander, which belonged to [[Seleucus I Nicator]] of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. The Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]] would then establish the [[List of largest empires in India|largest empire in the Indian Subcontinent]] through an aggressive expansion. Ashoka converted to [[Buddhism]] following the destructive [[Kalinga War]], abandoning further conquests in favor of humanitarian reforms.&lt;ref&gt;The Contribution of the Emperor Asoka Maurya to the Development of the Humanitarian Ideal in Warfare
30-04-1995 Article, International Review of the Red Cross, No. 305, by Gerald Draper&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka erected the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] to spread Buddhism and the 'Law of Piety' throughout his dominion. In one of his edicts, Ashoka claims to have converted his Greek population along with others to Buddhism.
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

The last Mauryan Emperor [[Brihadratha]] was assassinated by [[Pushyamitra Shunga]], the former [[senapati]] or "army lord" of the Mauryan Empire and founder of the [[Shunga Empire]]. Pushyamitra is alleged to have persecuted Buddhism in favor of [[Historical Vedic religion|brahmanism]], likely in attempt to further remove the legacy of the Mauryan Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lahiri, Bela (1974).

It is possible that [[Milinda|Menander I]] Soter or the "Saviour king", choose [[Sagala|Sakala]] as his capital due to the Buddhist presence there. Menander I, is stated to have converted to Buddhism&lt;ref&gt;"It is not unlikely that "Dikaios", which is translated Dhramaika in the Kharosthi legend, may be connected with his adoption of the Buddhist faith."

[[Plutarch]] also presents Menander as an example of benevolent rule, and explains that upon his death, the honour of sharing his remains was claimed by the various cities under his rule, and they were enshrined in "monuments" (μνημεία, probably [[stupa]]s), in a parallel with the historic [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]:&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley, p.377&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Followers of the Dharma"===
[[File:Menander II Zeus and wheel reverse.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Menander II]] (90–85 BCE).

Several Indo-Greek kings use the title "Dharmikasa", i.e. "Follower of the Dharma", in the [[Kharoshti]] script on the obverse of their coins. The corresponding legend in Greek is "Dikaios" ("The Just"), a rather usual attribute on Greek coins. The expression "Follower of the Dharma" would of course resonate strongly with Indian subjects, used to this expression being employed by pious kings, especially since the time of [[Ashoka]] who advocated the [[Dharma]] in his [[Edicts of Ashoka|inscriptions]]. The seven kings using "Dharmakasa", i.e. "Follower of the Dharma", are late Indo-Greek kings, from around 150 BCE, right after the reign of [[Menander I]], and mainly associated with the area of [[Gandhara]]: [[Zoilos I]] (130–120 BCE), [[Strato I|Strato]] (130–110 BCE), [[Heliokles II]] (95–80 BCE), [[Theophilos (king)|Theophilos]] (130 or 90 BCE), [[Menander II]] (90–85 BCE), [[Archebios]] (90–80 BCE) and [[Peukolaos]] (c. 90 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Impact on Indian Life and Culture (c. 326 B.C. to C. 300 A.D.)

===Blessing gestures===

The [[Heliodorus pillar]] is a stone column that was erected around 113 BCE in central [[India]]{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} in [[Vidisha]] near modern [[Besnagar]], by [[Heliodorus (votive erector)|Heliodorus]], a Greek ambassador of the [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Antialcidas]]&lt;ref name="SW"/&gt; to the court of the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] king [[Bhagabhadra]]. The pillar originally supported a statue of [[Garuda]]. In the dedication, the Indo-Greek ambassador explains he is a devotee of "[[Vāsudeva]], the God of Gods". Historically, it is the first known inscription related to the [[Bhagavata]] cult in [[India]].&lt;ref name="Bopearachchi"&gt;[[Osmund Bopearachchi]], 2016, [https://www.academia.edu/25807197/Emergence_of_Vi%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87u_and_%C5%9Aiva_Images_in_India_Numismatic_and_Sculptural_Evidence Emergence of Viṣṇu and Śiva Images in India: Numismatic and Sculptural Evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
{{Main article|Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Art of the Indo-Greeks}}

In general, the art of the Indo-Greeks is poorly documented, and few works of art (apart from their coins and a few [[stone palette]]s) are directly attributed to them. The coinage of the Indo-Greeks however is generally considered as some of the most artistically brilliant of Antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;"The extraordinary realism of their portraiture. The portraits of Demetrius, Antimachus and of Eucratides are among the most remarkable that have come down to us from antiquity" Hellenism in Ancient India, Banerjee, p134&lt;/ref&gt; The Hellenistic heritage ([[Ai-Khanoum]]) and artistic proficiency of the Indo-Greek world would suggest a rich sculptural tradition as well, but traditionally very few sculptural remains have been attributed to them. On the contrary, most Gandharan Hellenistic works of art are usually attributed to the direct successors of the Indo-Greeks in India in the 1st century AD, such as the nomadic [[Indo-Scythians]], the [[Indo-Parthians]] and, in an already decadent state, the [[Kushans]]&lt;ref&gt;"Just as the [[Franks|Frank]] [[Clovis I|Clovis]] had no part in the development of [[Gallo-Roman art]], the Indo-Scythian Kanishka had no direct influence on that of Indo-Greek Art; and besides, we have now the certain proofs that during his reign this art was already stereotyped, of not decadent" Hellenism in Ancient India, Banerjee, p147&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Gandharan sculpture cannot be dated exactly, leaving the exact chronology open to interpretation.

[[File:Indo-GreekBanquet.JPG|thumb|left|Hellenistic culture in the Indian subcontinent: Greek clothes, [[amphora]]s, wine and music (Detail of [[Chakhil-i-Ghoundi stupa]], [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], [[Gandhara]], 1st century AD).]]

The possibility of a direct connection between the Indo-Greeks and [[Greco-Buddhist art]] has been reaffirmed recently as the dating of the rule of Indo-Greek kings has been extended to the first decades of the 1st century AD, with the reign of [[Strato II]] in the Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;"The survival into the 1st century AD of a Greek administration and presumably some elements of Greek culture in the Punjab has now to be taken into account in any discussion of the role of Greek influence in the development of Gandharan sculpture", The Crossroads of Asia, p14&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Foucher, Tarn, and more recently, Boardman, Bussagli and McEvilley have taken the view that some of the most purely Hellenistic works of northwestern India and Afghanistan, may actually be wrongly attributed to later centuries, and instead belong to a period one or two centuries earlier, to the time of the Indo-Greeks in the 2nd–1st century BC:&lt;ref&gt;On the Indo-Greeks and the Gandhara school:
*1) "It is necessary to considerably push back the start of Gandharan art, to the first half of the first century BC, or even, very probably, to the preceding century.(...) The origins of Gandharan art... go back to the Greek presence. (...) Gandharan iconography was already fully formed before, or at least at the very beginning of our era" Mario Bussagli "L'art du Gandhara", p331–332
*2) "The beginnings of the Gandhara school have been dated everywhere from the first century B.C. (which was M.Foucher's view) to the Kushan period and even after it" (Tarn, p. 394). Foucher's views can be found in "La vieille route de l'Inde, de Bactres a Taxila", pp340–341). The view is also supported by Sir John Marshall ("The Buddhist art of Gandhara", pp5–6).
*3) Also the recent discoveries at [[Ai-Khanoum]] confirm that "Gandharan art descended directly from Hellenized Bactrian art" (Chaibi Nustamandy, "Crossroads of Asia", 1992).
*4) On the Indo-Greeks and Greco-Buddhist art: "It was about this time (100 BC) that something took place which is without parallel in Hellenistic history: Greeks of themselves placed their artistic skill at the service of a foreign religion, and created for it a new form of expression in art" (Tarn, p. 393). "We have to look for the beginnings of Gandharan Buddhist art in the residual Indo-Greek tradition, and in the early Buddhist stone sculpture to the South (Bharhut etc...)" (Boardman, 1993, p. 124). "Depending on how the dates are worked out, the spread of Gandhari Buddhism to the north may have been stimulated by Menander's royal patronage, as may the development and spread of the Gandharan sculpture, which seems to have accompanied it" McEvilley, 2002, "The shape of ancient thought", p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Intaglio gems from the northwest of India.jpg|thumb|[[ Intaglio (sculpture)|Intaglio gems]] engraved in the northwest of India (2nd century BCE-2nd century CE).]]
This is particularly the case of some purely Hellenistic works in [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], [[Afghanistan]], an area which "might indeed be the cradle of incipient Buddhist sculpture in Indo-Greek style".&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to one of the Buddha triads in Hadda, in which the Buddha is sided by very Classical depictions of [[Herakles]]/[[Vajrapani]] and [[Tyche]]/[[Hariti]], Boardman explains that both figures "might at first (and even second) glance, pass as, say, from Asia Minor or Syria of the first or second century BC (...) these are essentially Greek figures, executed by artists fully conversant with far more than the externals of the Classical style".&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, it has been suggested that these works of art may have been executed by itinerant Greek artists during the time of maritime contacts with the West from the 1st to the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;"Others, dating the work to the first two centuries A.D., after the waning of Greek autonomy on the Northwest, connect it instead with the Roman Imperial trade, which was just then getting a foothold at sites like [[Barbarikon|Barbaricum]] (modern [[Karachi]]) at the Indus-mouth. It has been proposed that one of the embassies from Indian kings to Roman emperors may have brought back a master sculptorto oversee work in the emerging Mahayana Buddhist sensibility (in which the Buddha came to be seen as a kind of deity), and that "bands of foreign workmen from the eastern centres of the [[Roman Empire]]" were brought to India" (Mc Evilley "The shape of ancient thought", quoting Benjamin Rowland "The art and architecture of India" p121 and A.C. Soper "The Roman Style in Gandhara" American Journal of Archaeology 55 (1951) pp. 301–319)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], beyond the omnipresence of Greek style and stylistic elements which might be simply considered as an enduring artistic tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; offers numerous depictions of people in Greek [[classical antiquity|Classical]] realistic style, attitudes and fashion (clothes such as the [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] and the [[himation]], similar in form and style to the 2nd century BC [[Greco-Bactrian]] statues of [[Ai-Khanoum]], hairstyle), holding contraptions which are characteristic of Greek culture ([[amphora]]s, "kantaros" Greek drinking cups), in situations which can range from festive (such as [[Bacchanal]]ian scenes) to Buddhist-devotional.&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley, p.388-390&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 109–153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- more specific pages? --&gt;

[[File:SeatedBuddhaGandhara2ndCenturyOstasiatischeMuseum.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Seated [[Buddha]], Gandhara, 2nd century (Ostasiatisches Museum, Berlin)]]

Uncertainties in dating make it unclear whether these works of art actually depict Greeks of the period of Indo-Greek rule up to the 1st century BC, or remaining Greek communities under the rule of the [[Indo-Parthians]] or [[Kushans]] in the 1st and 2nd century AD. Benjamin Rowland thinks that the Indo-Greeks, rather than the Indo-Scythians or the Kushans, may have been the models for the [[Bodhisattva]] statues of Gandhara&lt;ref&gt;"It is noteworthy that the dress of the Gandharan Bodhisattva statues has no resemblance whatever to that of the Kushan royal portrait statues, which has many affiliations with Parthian costume. The finery of the Gandhara images must be modeled on the dress of local native nobility, princes of Indian or Indo-Greek race, who had no blood connection with the Scythian rulers. It is also evident that the facial types are unrelated to the features of the Kushans as we know them from their coins and fragmentary portrait statues.", Benjamin Rowland JR, foreword to "The Dyasntic art of the Kushan", John Rosenfield, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Very little is known about the economy of the Indo-Greeks, although it seems to have been rather vibrant.&lt;ref&gt;"Those tiny territories of the Indo-Greek kings must have been lively and commercially flourishing places", ''India: The ancient past'', Burjor Avari, p.130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"No doubt the Greeks of Bactria and India presided over a flourishing economy. This is clearly indicated by their coinage and the monetary exchange they had established with other currencies." Narain, "The Indo-Greeks" 2003, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coinage===
{{Further|Post-Mauryan coinage of Gandhara|Post-Mauryan coinage}}
The abundance of their coins would tend to suggest large mining operations, particularly in the mountainous area of the [[Hindu-Kush]], and an important monetary economy. The Indo-Greek did strike bilingual coins both in the Greek "round" standard and in the Indian "square" standard,&lt;ref&gt;Bopearachchi, "Monnaies", p.27&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that monetary circulation extended to all parts of society. The adoption of Indo-Greek monetary conventions by neighbouring kingdoms, such as the [[Kuninda kingdom|Kunindas]] to the east and the [[Satavahanas]] to the south,&lt;ref&gt;Rapson, clxxxvi-&lt;/ref&gt; would also suggest that Indo-Greek coins were used extensively for cross-border trade.

===Tribute payments===

[[File:StonePaletteMythologicalScene.jpg|thumb|[[Stone palette]] depicting a mythological scene, 2nd–1st century BC.]]
It would also seem that some of the coins emitted by the Indo-Greek kings, particularly those in the monolingual [[Attic standard]], may have been used to pay some form of tribute to the Yuezhi tribes north of the Hindu-Kush.&lt;ref name = "Benard-p76"/&gt; This is indicated by the coins finds of the [[Qunduz]] hoard in northern Afghanistan, which have yielded quantities of Indo-Greek coins in the Hellenistic standard (Greek weights, Greek language), although none of the kings represented in the hoard are known to have ruled so far north.&lt;ref&gt;Bopearachchi, "Monnaies", p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, none of these coins have ever been found south of the Hindu-Kush.&lt;ref&gt;Fussman, JA 1993, p. 127 and Bopearachchi, "Graeco-Bactrian issues of the later Indo-Greek kings", Num. Chron. 1990, pp. 79–104)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade with China===

[[File:Coin of Greco-Baktrian Kingdom king Pantaleon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cupro-nickel]] coins of king [[Pantaleon]] point to a Chinese origin of the metal.&lt;ref name="Needham 237"/&gt;]]
The Indo-Greek kings in Southern Asia issued the first known [[cupro-nickel]] coins, with [[Euthydemus II]], dating from 180 to 170 BC, and his younger brothers [[Pantaleon]] and [[Agathocles of Bactria|Agathocles]] around 170 BC. As only [[China]] was able to produce cupro-nickel at that time, and as the alloy ratios are exclusively similar, it has been suggested that the metal was the result of exchanges between China and Bactria.&lt;ref name="Needham 237"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BYixSmXUCuMC&amp;pg=PA237 ''Science and civilisation in China: Chemistry and chemical technology'' by Joseph Needham, Gwei-Djen Lu p. 237''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt;

An indirect testimony by the Chinese explorer [[Zhang Qian]], who visited Bactria around 128 BC, suggests that intense trade with [[Southern China]] was going through northern India. Zhang Qian explains that he found Chinese products in the Bactrian markets, and that they were transiting through northwestern India, which he incidentally describes as a civilization similar to that of Bactria:
{{quote|"When I was in Bactria", Zhang Qian reported, "I saw bamboo canes from [[Qiong]] and cloth (silk?) made in the province of [[Shu (state)|Shu]]. When I asked the people how they had gotten such articles, they replied: "Our merchants go buy them in the markets of Shendu (northwestern India). Shendu, they told me, lies several thousand [[Li (Chinese unit)|li]] southeast of Bactria. The people cultivate land, and live much like the people of Bactria".|[[Sima Qian]], "Records of the Great Historian", trans. Burton Watson, p. 236.}}

Recent excavations at the burial site of [[China]]'s first Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]], dating back to the 3rd century BCE, also suggest Greek influence in the artworks found there, including in the manufacture of the famous [[Terracotta army]]. It is also suggested that Greek artists may have come to China at that time to train local artisans in making sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-37624943|title=Western contact with China began long before Marco Polo, experts say|date=12 October 2016|accessdate=16 April 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161011006769/en/Mausoleum-China%E2%80%99s-Emperor-Partners-BBC-National-Geographic|title=The Mausoleum of China's First Emperor Partners with the BBC and National Geographic Channel to Reveal Groundbreaking Evidence That China Was in Contact with the West During the Reign of the First Emperor|website=businesswire.com|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Ocean trade===
{{see also|Periplus of the Erythraean Sea}}
Maritime relations across the Indian Ocean started in the 3rd century BC, and further developed during the time of the Indo-Greeks together with their territorial expansion along the western coast of India. The first contacts started when the [[Ptolemies]] constructed the [[Red Sea]] ports of [[Myos Hormos]] and [[Berenice (port)|Berenike]], with destination the [[Indus River|Indus]] delta, the [[Kathiawar]] peninsula or [[Muziris]]. Around 130 BC, [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] is reported ([[Strabo]], ''Geog.''&amp;nbsp; II.3.4)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2C*.html#3.4|title=Strabo II.3.4‑5 on Eudoxus}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have made a successful voyage to India and returned with a cargo of [[perfume]]s and [[gemstone]]s. By the time Indo-Greek rule was ending, up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from Myos Hormos to India (Strabo ''Geog.'' II.5.12).&lt;ref&gt;"Since the merchants of Alexandria are already sailing with fleets by way of the Nile and of the Persian Gulf as far as India, these regions also have become far better known to us of today than to our predecessors. At any rate, when Gallus was prefect of Egypt, I accompanied him and ascended the Nile as far as Syene and the frontiers of Ethiopia, and I learned that as many as one hundred and twenty vessels were sailing from Myos Hormos for India, whereas formerly, under the Ptolemies, only a very few ventured to undertake the voyage and to carry on traffic in Indian merchandise." [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html Strabo II.5.12]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armed forces==
[[File:Gandharan Athena.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Athena]] in the art of [[Gandhara]]]]
The coins of the Indo-Greeks provide rich clues on their uniforms and weapons. Typical Hellenistic uniforms are depicted, with helmets being either round in the Greco-Bactrian style, or the flat [[kausia]] of the Macedonians (coins of [[Apollodotus I]]).

===Military technology===

Their weapons were spears, swords, longbow (on the coins of [[Agathokleia]]) and arrows. Around 130 BC, the Central Asian [[recurve bow]] of the steppes with its [[gorytos]] box started to appear for the first time on the coins of [[Zoilos I]], suggesting strong interactions (and apparently an alliance) with nomadic peoples, either the Yuezhi or the Scythians.&lt;ref&gt;"It is curious that on his copper Zoilos used a Bow and quiver as a type. A quiver was a badge used by the Parthians (Scythians) and had been used previously by Diodotos, who we know had made a treaty with them. Did Zoilos use Scythian mercenaries in his quest against Menander perhaps?" Senior, Indo-Scythian coins, p.xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; The recurve bow becomes a standard feature of Indo-Greek horsemen by 90 BC, as seen on some of the coins of [[King Hermaeus|Hermaeus]].

Generally, Indo-Greek kings are often represented riding horses, as early as the reign of [[Antimachus II]] around 160 BC. The equestrian tradition probably goes back to the [[Greco-Bactrians]], who are said by [[Polybius]] to have faced a [[Seleucid]] invasion in 210 BC with 10,000 horsemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+10.49|title=Polybius 10.49, Battle of the Arius}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[war elephants]] are never represented on coins, a harness plate ([[phalera (military decoration)|phalera]]) dated to the 3–2nd century BC, today in the [[Hermitage Museum]], depicts a helmetted Greek combatant on an Indian war elephant.

The Milinda Panha, in the questions of [[Nagasena]] to king Menander, provides a rare glimpse of the military methods of the period:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
-(Nagasena) Has it ever happened to you, O king, that rival kings rose up against you as enemies and opponents?
-(Menander) Yes, certainly.
-Then you set to work, I suppose, to have moats dug, and ramparts thrown up, and watch towers erected, and strongholds built, and stores of food collected?
-Not at all. All that had been prepared beforehand.
-Or you had yourself trained in the management of war elephants, and in horsemanship, and in the use of the war chariot, and in archery and fencing?
-Not at all. I had learnt all that before.
-But why?
-With the object of warding off future danger.&lt;/poem&gt;|([[Milinda Panha]], Book III, Chap 7)}}

The Milinda Panha also describes the structure of Menander's army:
{{quote|Now one day Milinda the king proceeded forth out of the city to pass in review the innumerable host of his mighty army in its fourfold array (of elephants, cavalry, bowmen, and soldiers on foot).|(Milinda Panha, Book I)}}

===Size of Indo-Greek armies===
[[File:Agathokleia drachm king Strato in uniform circa 100 BCE.jpg|thumb|King [[Strato I]] in combat gear, making a blessing gesture, circa 100 BCE.]]
The armed forces of the Indo-Greeks engaged in battles with other Indian kingdoms. The ruler of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]], King [[Kharavela]], states in the [[Hathigumpha inscription]] that during the 8th year of his reign he led a large army in the direction of a Yavana King, and that he forced their demoralized army to retreat to Mathura.{{Quote|"Then in the eighth year, ([[Kharavela]]) with a large army having sacked Goradhagiri causes pressure on Rajagaha ([[Rajgir|Rajagriha]]). On account of the loud report of this act of valour, the Yavana (Greek) King Dimi[ta] retreated to [[Mathura]] having extricated his demoralized army."|Hathigumpha inscription, lines 7-8, probably in the 1st century BCE. Original text is in Brahmi script.&lt;ref name="archive87"/&gt;}}
The name of the Yavana king is not clear, but it contains three letters, and the middle letter can be read as ''ma'' or ''mi''.&lt;ref&gt;PL Gupta 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. D. Banerji]] and [[K.P. Jayaswal]] read the name of the Yavana king as "Dimita", and identify him with [[Demetrius I of Bactria]]. However, according to [[Ramaprasad Chanda]], this identification results in "chronological impossibilities".&lt;ref name="Sudhakar_1974"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya |title=Some Early Dynasties of South India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=78I5lDHU2jQC&amp;pg=PA20 |year=1974 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=978-81-208-2941-1 |pages=44–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Greek ambassador [[Megasthenes]] took special note of the military strength of Kalinga in his ''[[Megasthenes|Indica]]'' in the middle of the 3rd century BC:
{{quote|The royal city of the Calingae (Kalinga) is called Parthalis. Over their king 60,000 foot-soldiers, 1,000 horsemen, 700 elephants keep watch and ward in "procinct of war."|Megasthenes fragm. LVI. in Plin. Hist. Nat. VI. 21. 8–23. 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mssu.edu/projectsouthasia/history/primarydocs/Foreign_Views/GreekRoman/Megasthenes-Indika.htm |title=Megasthenes Indica |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210080315/http://www.mssu.edu/projectsouthasia/history/primarydocs/Foreign_Views/GreekRoman/Megasthenes-Indika.htm |archivedate=December 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An account by the Roman writer [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]] gives another hint of the size of Indo-Greek armies, which, in the case of the conflict between the Greco-Bactrian [[Eucratides]] and the Indo-Greek [[Demetrius II of India|Demetrius II]], he numbers at 60,000 (although they allegedly lost to 300 Greco-Bactrians):

{{quote|[[Eucratides]] led many wars with great courage, and, while weakened by them, was put under siege by [[Demetrius II of India|Demetrius]], king of the Indians. He made numerous sorties, and managed to vanquish 60,000 enemies with 300 soldiers, and thus liberated after four months, he put India under his rule|Justin, XLI,6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte41.html|title=Justin XLI}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Indo-Greek armies would be conquered by [[Indo-Scythians]], a nomadic tribe from Central Asia.

==Legacy of the Indo-Greeks==
{{Main article|Legacy of the Indo-Greeks}}
[[File:TaxilaCopperPlate.JPG|thumb|The Indo-Scythian [[Taxila copper plate]] uses the Macedonian month of "[[Panemos]]" for calendrical purposes ([[British Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
From the 1st century AD, the Greek communities of central Asia and the northwestern [[Indian subcontinent]]  lived under the control of the [[Kushan]] branch of the Yuezhi, apart from a short-lived invasion of the [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;"Though the Indo-Greek monarchies seem to have ended in the first century BC, the Greek presence in India and Bactria remained strong", McEvilley, p.379&lt;/ref&gt; The Kushans founded the [[Kushan Empire]], which was to prosper for several centuries. In the south, the Greeks were under the rule of the [[Western Kshatrapas]]. The [[Kalash people|Kalash]] tribe of the [[Chitral Valley]] claim to be descendants of the Indo-Greeks; although this is disputed.

[[File:Couple from Taxila IV.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hellenistic couple from [[Taxila]] (IV)]]
It is unclear how much longer the Greeks managed to maintain a distinct presence in the Indian sub-continent. The legacy of the Indo-Greeks was felt however for several centuries, from the usage of the Greek language and calendrical methods,&lt;ref&gt;"The use of the Greek months by the Sakas and later rulers points to the conclusion that they employed a system of dating started by their predecessors." Narain, "Indo-Greeks" 2003, p.190&lt;/ref&gt; to the influences on the numismatics of the Indian subcontinent, traceable down to the period of the [[Gupta Empire]] in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Evidence of the conquest of Saurastra during the reign of Chandragupta II is to be seen in his rare silver coins which are more directly imitated from those of the Western Satraps... they retain some traces of the old inscriptions in Greek characters, while on the reverse, they substitute the Gupta type (a peacock) for the chaitya with crescent and star." in Rapson "A catalogue of Indian coins in the British Museum. The Andhras etc...", p.cli&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks may also have maintained a presence in their cities until quite late. [[Isidorus of Charax]] in his 1st century AD "Parthian stations" [[Itinerarium|itinerary]] described an "Alexandropolis, the metropolis of Arachosia", thought to be [[Alexandria Arachosia]], which he said was still Greek even at such a late time:
{{quote|Beyond is Arachosia. And the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] call this White India; there are the city of Biyt and the city of Pharsana and the city of Chorochoad and the [[polis|city]] of [[Demetriapolis|Demetrias]]; then Alexandropolis, the [[metropolis]] of Arachosia; it is [[Hellenistic|Greek]], and by it flows the river [[Arghandab River|Arachotus]]. As far as this place the land is under the rule of the Parthians.&lt;ref&gt;"Parthians stations", 1st century AD. Original text in paragraph 19 of [http://www.parthia.com/doc/parthian_stations.htm#PARTHIAN_STATIONS Parthian stations]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Indo-Greeks may also have had some influence on the religious plane as well, especially in relation to the developing [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. Mahayana Buddhism has been described as "the form of Buddhism which (regardless of how Hinduized its later forms became) seems to have originated in the Greco-Buddhist communities of India, through a conflation of the Greek [[Democritus|Democritean]]–[[Sophism|Sophistic]]–[[Philosophical skepticism|Skeptical]] tradition with the rudimentary and unformalized empirical and skeptical elements already present in early Buddhism".&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley, "The Shape of Ancient Thought", p503.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indo-Greek kings: their coins, territories and chronology==
[[File:IndoGreeksTrojanHorse.jpg|thumb|The story of the [[Trojan horse]] was depicted in the art of [[Gandhara]]. [[British Museum]].]]
Today 36 Indo-Greek kings are known. Several of them are also recorded in Western and Indian historical sources, but the majority are known through [[numismatic]] evidence only. The exact [[chronology]] and sequencing of their rule is still a matter of scholarly inquiry, with adjustments regular being made with new analysis and coin finds (overstrikes of one king over another's coins being the most critical element in establishing chronological sequences).

There is an important evolution of coin shape (round to square) and material (from gold to silver to brass) across the territories and the periods, and from Greek type to Indian type over a period of nearly 3 centuries. Also, the quality of coinage illustration decreases down to the 1st century CE. Coinage evolution is an important point of Indo-Greek history, and actually one of the most important since most of these kings are only known by their coins, and their chronology is mainly established by the evolution of the coin types.

The system used here is adapted from Osmund Bopearachchi, supplemented by the views of R C Senior and occasionally other authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Under each king, information from Bopearachchi is taken from ''Monnaies Gréco-Bactriennes et Indo-Grecques, Catalogue Raisonné'' (1991) or occasionally ''SNG9'' (1998). Senior's chronology is from ''The Indo-Greek and Indo-Scythian king sequences in the second and first centuries BC'', ONS179 Supplement (2004), whereas the comments (down to the time of Hippostratos) are from ''The decline of the Indo-Greeks'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The subcategories for the awards change from year to year, but generally focus on [[biomedicine]], [[computing]], [[communication]]s, [[business]], [[energy]], [[materials science|materials]], and the [[World Wide Web|web]]. Nominations are sent from around the world and evaluated by a panel of expert judges. In some years, an Innovator of the Year or a Humanitarian of the Year is also named from among the winners.

'''James J. Fyfe''' (February 16, 1942 – November 12, 2005) was an American [[Criminology|criminologist]], a leading authority on the police use of force and police accountability, and a police administrator.

His research on the police use of deadly force has been cited extensively, most notably in the 1985 Supreme Court case of ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'', in which the Court ruled as unconstitutional police department policies that allow officers to shoot to kill "fleeing felons" who do not pose an immediate danger to the community. The Supreme Court cited his dissertation in its majority opinion.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Al|title=James Fyfe, 63, Criminologist and Police Training Director, Is Dead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/15/nyregion/15fyfe.html?_r=0|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=15 Nov 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Fyfe rose to the rank of lieutenant with the [[New York Police Department]] (NYPD) and in 1978, after 15 years of service with the NYPD, earned a [[PhD]] in [[Criminal Justice]] from the [[University at Albany, SUNY]].

He became a professor of [[criminal justice]] at [[American University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1979–92), then at [[Temple University]] in Philadelphia (1992–99), and finally at [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] (1999–2005), where he was appointed distinguished professor in 2002. He wrote hundreds of scholarly and popular newspaper articles and regularly appeared on media outlets discussing police practices.

During those years, he also served as an expert witness in lawsuits against the police, researching and testifying in over 500 cases on behalf of the police or against them.  He worked on such well-known police misconduct cases as the Tracey Thurman case (police response to domestic violence), a series of cases challenging the Los Angeles Police Department's use of a "Special Investigations" squad (which resulted in a finding of personal liability on the part of Chief Daryl Gates,) the Jeffrey Daumer case (in which Milwaukee police did not respond to the serial murderer's victimization of a young immigrant boy,) the Ruby Ridge shooting, a series of cases from Philadelphia, and hundreds of others in which police use of deadly force was at issue.  Perhaps the most controversial of these was Fyfe's testimony in the Amadou Diallo case in New York City, which was a homicide prosecution of four officers who had shot and killed an unarmed West African immigrant.  Fyfe testified on behalf of the officers, believing their state of mind and the performance of their semi-automatic weapons showed they were not criminally guilty.  (They were acquitted.)  Whether the NYPD itself should be held responsible in civil court for the program that put the officers on patrol under those rules was a different matter, and the Diallo family eventually received $3,000,000 as compensation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/07/nyregion/3-million-deal-in-police-killing-of-diallo-in-99.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Such civil lawsuits seek to hold the police to a common standard of professionalism discernible in practices and procedures developed in good police departments nationwide.  Fyfe regularly testified as to what those standards were, almost always as part of lawsuits charging police departments with operating under unconstitutional "custom, policy, or practice."

In 2002, he took a leave of absence from John Jay College of Criminal Justice to become Deputy Commissioner for Training with the NYPD.

He died of cancer in 2005, aged 63.  He had three daughters and three grandchildren.

Fyfe's papers are housed in the Special Collections at [[Lloyd Sealy Library]], [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manuscript Collections |url=http://guides.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/content.php?pid=227219&amp;sid=1880539 |publisher=Lloyd Sealy Library Special Collections, John Jay College of Criminal Justice |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sardar Kaura Khan Qaisrani''' the heroic chief of the [[Qaisrani]] tribe ''(1812-18**).'' His sons were Sardar Jahangir Khan, [[Sardar Muhammad Hayat Khan]], Sardar Qadir Bakhsh Khan.

==Recounting the story==
As [[Baloch people|Baloch]] herdsmen lead their sheep and goats across the wild and desolate gorges in search of forage forever scarce, they sing the ''vars'' (ballads) of their heroes. One that resounds across the Suleman crags is the story of Kaura Khan of the [[Qaisrani]] tribe.  Not only is it sung in verse, it is narrated in prose as well — all of its several versions that vary but slightly.

==The story==
Kaura Khan was a brave [[Baloch people|Baloch]] of great physical strength and towering stature who inherited land from a line of illustrious forefathers. Misfortune brought upon him include the overlordship of the Sikhs and the British. Khan resisted them each with all his might. But where the Sikhs failed the British forced their writ, a law alien to the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] way of life. Proud and willful, the [[Qaisrani]]  took it upon themselves to resist the new masters of their land. And so the first angrez ever to venture into this land of turbulent tribes in order to establish his government’s decree was told by Kaura Khan that the new law would be unacceptable to him and his people. An altercation ensued in which the white officer, a man called Giri(real name Lieutenant Grey but famously pronounced as Giri)), threatened the Khan: The man was bound hand and foot and taken into the hills.

For a full month Khan kept Giri in distant, unreachable valleys while his colleagues tried every which way to secure his release. Giri was liberated eventually, but only after British authorities submitted to the will of Khan and agreed that in his domain only his word would do. "The Lord’s will was done," so the ballad ends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4571">The '''Kusunda''' or Ban Raja ("people of the forest"), known to themselves as the ''Mihaq'' or ''Myahq'' (&lt; *''Myahak''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/kusunda.htm B. K. Rana (Linguistic Society of Nepal), "New Materials on Kusunda Language"] (Presented to the Fourth Round Table International Conference on Ethnogenesis of South and Central Asia, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, USA.  May 11–13, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; are a tribe of former [[hunter-gatherer]]s of the forests of western [[Nepal]], who are now intermarried with neighboring peoples and settled in villages.

In 1968 American anthropologist Johan Reinhard located a few of the last surviving Kusunda near Gorkha in Central Nepal, and in 1969 and 1975 he found further members in Dang and Surkhet valleys in western Nepal, collecting basic linguistic and ethnographic data (see references below). Shortly earlier, in about 1956, René Nebesky-Wojokowitz wrote a report after he was told by villagers of Kusundas conducting [[silent trade]] with Nepali farmers. The Kusunda were said to have brought a deer hunted recently and left it for a farm household with the unspoken expectation that the farmers would give the Kusunda farm goods.&lt;ref&gt;Nebesky-Wojkowitz, René. 1959. Kusunda and Chepang: Notes on Two Little-Known Tribes of Nepal. Bulletin of the International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research 2: 77-84.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kusunda mainly hunted birds resting in trees at night with bows and exceptionally long (ca. 160&amp;nbsp;cm) unfeathered arrows, which were poorly suited for the hunting of land animals.  Their custom of eating only the meat of wild animals extended until recent times. The Kusunda are followers of [[animism]], though [[Hindu]] overtones may be seen in their religious rituals. According to the 2001 Nepal census, there are a total of 164 ethnic Kusunda of whom 160 were Hindus and 4 were Buddhists. The [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word ''Kusunda'' originally meant "savage", as the neighboring [[Chepang people|Chepang]] and other groups traditionally thought of them as savages. {{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Kusunda language==
{{main|Kusunda language}}
[[David E. Watters|Watters]] (2005) published a mid-sized grammatical description of the [[Kusunda language]], plus vocabulary, which shows that Kusunda is indeed a language isolate. Nepali is now their language of everyday communication. The language is almost [[Moribund language|moribund]], with no children learning it, as all Kusunda speakers have married outside their ethnicity. Only one speaker survives in Nepal, an elderly woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gautam|first=Bimal|title=Nepal's mystery language on the verge of extinction|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17537845|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 September 2012|date=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kutchi Memons''' ({{lang-ur|'''کچھی میمن'''}}) are a part of {{clarify|date=May 2013}} largest [[Memon people|Memons]], a [[Muslim]] community of [[Pakistan]] and [[India]], who speak the [[Memon language]] and are original residents of [[Kutch]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indopedia.org/index.php?title=Memon Memon : There are also related ethnic groups such as the Kutchi (or Cutchi) Memons and Sindhi Memons.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Transliteration of name of this [[Memon people|Memon]] community has not been standardized. Hence popular usage is [http://come.to/memon Cutchi] and [http://in.groups.yahoo.com/group/Kutchimemons Kutchi].&lt;br&gt; Nevertheless, Kutchi Memons are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslims who migrated from [[Sindh]] to [[Kutch District|Kutch]] in [[Gujarat]], a [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[India]], after their conversion to Islam in 1422 CE{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} . Historically, Kutch was a princely state and this kingdom included [[Bhuj]], [[Anjar, India|Anjar]], Lakhpath, [[Mandvi]], etc. The Kutchi Memons are now spread all over the globe. Though Kutchi Memons historically spoke [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], use of this language has sharply declined, and many Kutchi Memons (particularly those who reside in [[urban area]]s) have adopted [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and other more dominant tongues.  
Scholars have conducted detailed studies about the origin and development of this community. Scholarly contributors include, [http://www.memon.freeservers.com/originmemon1.htm Dr. Asghar Ali Engineer]: [http://www.memon.freeservers.com/originmemon.htm Dr. Mohamed Taher], etc.

Kutchi Memons are a highly endogenous community, where marriages are arranged within their own ethnic group. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007333O5K Humeirah]- a Novel written by [http://sabahcarrim.com Sabah Carrim], is about the Kutchi Memons. The story is set on the island of [[Mauritius]].

Kutchi Memons are a predominantly business community and are known for their [[Philanthropy]]. The Kutchi Memons are spread all over the globe&lt;ref&gt;[http://cutchimemon.org/cutchi_memon_jamath_chennai_tamil_nadu_india]&lt;/ref&gt; and have erected many mosques all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cutchimemon.blogspot.com/2010/01/cutchi-memon-jamath-of-nilgiris-india.html Cutchi Memon Jamath - Mosques built by them]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kutchi Memon Masjid, Mangalore==

The Kutchi Memon Masjid, Mangalore (also known locally as the Katchi Palli) is located opposite the famous Bombay Lucky Restaurant in Mangalore. It was built in 1839 by Kutchi Memon spice traders from Gujarat. In 1930, this mosque was the first to get electric supply and the fourth to get electrified in Mangalore, during the [[British Raj|British rule]]. It was also the first to use loudspeakers to call for Azan, and the first in Mangalore where the Friday sermon was delivered in [[Urdu]].&lt;ref name=Deccan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saldanha-Shet|first1=I J|title=A symbol of Kutchi Memons|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/414005/a-symbol-kutchi-memons.html|accessdate=19 January 2015|issue=Bangalore|publisher=Deccan Herald|date=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Two Giraffes.PNG|thumb|[[Giraffes]] in [[Kenya]]; giraffes have been called "especially [[homosexual behavior in animals|gay]]" for often engaging in male-male sexual behavior more than male-female ([[heterosexual]]) [[sex]].&lt;ref name="You Are Being Lied to: The"&gt;Kick (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imaginova (2007f)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For these mammals, there is documented evidence of [[homosexual behavior in animals|homosexual behavior]] of one or more of the following kinds: [[Animal sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], [[courtship]], [[affection]], [[pair bond]]ing, or [[parenting]].

[[Bruce Bagemihl]] writes that the presence of [[same-sex sexual behavior]] was not officially observed on a large scale until the 1990s due to possible [[Observer-expectancy effect|observer bias]] caused by social attitudes towards [[LGBT]] people making homosexuality in animals a [[taboo]] subject.&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years"&gt;Bagemihl (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"&gt;News-medical.net (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; He devotes three chapters; ''Two Hundred Years at Looking at Homosexual Wildlife'', ''Explaining (Away) Animal Homosexuality,'' and ''Not For Breeding Only'' in his 1999 book ''Biological Exuberance'' to the "documentation of systematic [[prejudice]]s" where he notes "the ''present ignorance'' of [[biology]] lies precisely in its single-minded attempt to find reproductive (or other) "explanations" for homosexuality, transgender, and [[procreate|non-procreative]] and alternative [[heterosexual]]ities.&lt;ref name="Not For Breeding Only"&gt;Bagemihl (1999) page 213&lt;/ref&gt; Petter Bøckman, academic adviser for the ''[[Against Nature?]]'' exhibit stated "[M]any researchers have described homosexuality as something altogether different from sex. They must realise that animals can have sex with who they will, when they will and without consideration to a researcher's [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethical]] [[principle]]s". Homosexual behavior is  found amongst social [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, particularly the sea mammals and the [[primates]].&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"/&gt;

Animal sexual behavior takes many different forms, even within the same [[species]] and the motivations for and implications of their behaviors have yet to be fully understood. Bagemihl's research shows that homosexual behavior, not necessarily sexual activity, has been documented in about 500 species as of 1999, ranging from [[primates]] to [[Acanthocephala|gut worms]].&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biological Exuberance: Animal"&gt;Harrold (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality in animals is controversial with some [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] because it asserts the naturalness of homosexuality in humans, while others counter that it has no implications and is nonsensical to equate animal behavior to [[morality]].&lt;ref name="The Animal Homosexuality Myth"&gt;Solimeo (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Defending A Higher Law"&gt;Solimeo (2004b)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, social liberals and many gay people believe homosexuality is natural, and therefore find the existence of homosexual sex in animals unsurprising.  Animal preference and motivation is always inferred from behavior. Thus homosexual behavior has been given a number of terms over the years. The correct usage of the term ''homosexual'' is that an animal ''exhibits homosexual behavior'', however this article conforms to the usage by modern research&lt;ref&gt;Bagemihl (1999) pages 122-166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden (2004) pp.13-183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasey (1995) pages 173-204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommer &amp; Vasey (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; applying the term ''homosexuality'' to all sexual behavior ([[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]], [[genitals|genital]] stimulation, [[mating|mating games]] and sexual [[Display (zoology)|display behavior]]) between animals of the same sex.

This a list of some [[mammals]] that had been recorded engaging in homosexual behavior, which is part of a larger [[list of animals displaying homosexual behavior]] including [[birds]], [[insects]], [[fish]] etc.

The '''Tai Lü people''' ({{zh|傣仂}} ''Dǎi lè'', {{lang-lo|ລື້}} ''Lư&amp;#x0304;'', {{lang-th|ไทลื้อ}} {{RTGS|''Thai Lue''}}, {{lang-vi|Người Lự}}) are an ethnic group of [[China]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], and [[Vietnam]]. They speak a [[Southwestern Tai languages|Southwestern Tai language]].

== Distribution ==
In Vietnam, most Lu live in [[Lai Châu Province]], and their population was 5,601 in 2009. In China, they are officially recognized as part of the [[Dai people|Dai]] ethnic group. The 2000 census counted about 280,000 Dai people speaking Lü language. The population in Thailand, where they are called '''Thai Lue''' ({{lang-th|ไทลื้อ}}), was in 2001 estimated to be approximately 83,000.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone and Mandryk 2001; cited in {{Cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/khb |title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Online version |edition=18th |publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Thai Lue in Thailand live in [[Nan Province|Nan]], [[Chiang Rai Province|Chiang Rai]], [[Phayao Province|Phayao]] and [[Chiang Mai Province]].

In Vietnam, Lu are the indigenous people in [[Mường Thanh]] ("Land of the God of [[Tai people]]", Tai Lü: ''muong theng''). They had built Tam Vạn wall in Mường Thanh and managed there for 19 generations before Hoàng Công Chất, a Thái leader, came. Nowadays, nearly all Vietnamese Lu live in Lai Châu Province. The Lu take their father's last name and have the middle name Bạ (for males) and Ý (for females). Their religion is [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]]. They sing ''khắp lự'' and play ''pí me luk'' ("mother-children" flute).

'''Mauritians of Bantu-African origin''', more commonly known as '''Creole''', are [[Mauritians|Mauritian]] people whose ancestors were from Madagascar and Mozambique, and came to the island as slaves. They are a minority ethnic group in Mauritius; the majority being [[Mauritians of Indian origin|Indo-Mauritians]].

==Origins==
Creoles were brought in as slaves to work the plantations of Mauritius (as well as [[Réunion]] and [[Seychelles]]). The slaves were Bantus mostly brought from [[East Africa]]n [[Mozambique]] and [[Madagascar]]. The larger Creole community also includes the Coloureds (Mostly European in origin mixed with some African or Indian admixture). The Creole community also includes Christian Indians that have adopted a European/Creole way of life.

52 % of Creoles are largely African with considerable Indian admixture, referred to in the Mauritian context as Afro-Creoles. 1% are Coloureds (mostly European) while around 30% are largely Christian Indians with some having African admixtures. Creoles make up 30% of the Mauritian population. Since independence over 90% of Coloureds have left Mauritius, hence Creole is generally referred to as a mainly African person, as opposed to before Mauritian independence when Creole usually referred to a mixed-race person of mostly European background{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}.

==Demographical factors==
The majority of Creoles are [[Roman Catholic]]. There is also a [[non-religious]] minority as well as some [[Islamic]] converts. Due to increased connection with other African diaspora most notably from the [[Caribbean]] there are some Rastafarians. The mother tongue of Mauritians is the [[Mauritian Creole]], French and English are also spoken as second or third language.

{{Wiktionary|militant|militance}}
{{otheruses}}
The [[English language|English]] word '''''militant''''' is both an [[adjective]] and a [[noun]], and is generally used to mean vigorously [[Active lifestyle|active]], [[combative]] and [[aggression|aggressive]], especially in support of a cause, as in "militant reformers".&lt;ref name="DictionaryReference.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/militant |title=Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comes from the 15th century [[Latin]] "''militare''" meaning "to serve as a soldier". The related modern concept of the [[militia]] as a defensive organization against invaders grew out of the Anglo-Saxon [[fyrd]]. In times of crisis, the [[militiaman]] left his civilian duties and became a soldier until the emergency was over, when he returned to his civilian occupation.

The current meaning of ''militant'' does not usually refer to a registered soldier: it can be anyone who subscribes to the idea of using vigorous, sometimes extreme, activity to achieve an objective, usually political. A "militant [political] activist" would be expected to be more confrontational and aggressive than an activist not described as militant.

Militance may or may not include physical violence, armed [[combat]], terrorism, and the like. The [[Trotskyist]] [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group in the United Kingdom published a newspaper, was active in labour disputes, moved resolutions in political meetings, but was not based on violence. The purpose of the Christian [[Church Militant]] is to struggle against sin, the [[devil]] and ". . . the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places" (Ephesians 6:12), but it is not a violent movement.

==As adjective==
Militant can mean "vigorously [[Active lifestyle|active]] and [[aggression|aggressive]], especially in support of a cause" as in 'militant reformers'.&lt;ref name="DictionaryReference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/militant |title=Dictionary Reference.com |publisher=Dictionary Reference.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]], defines ''militant'' as "Having a combative character; aggressive, especially in the service of a cause". The [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] defines ''militant'' as "aggressively active (as in a cause)".&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"/&gt; It says that the word ''militant'' might  typically be used in phrases such as 'militant conservationists' or 'a militant attitude'.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"/&gt;

An example of the adjective usages is demonstrated when ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an article titled ''Militant Environmentalists Planning Summer Protests to Save Redwoods'' describing a group that believes in "confrontational demonstrations" and "nonviolent tactics" to get across their message of preserving the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/19/us/militant-environmentalists-planning-summer-protests-to-save-redwoods.html?pagewanted=all |title=The New York Times |work=The New York Times |date=19 June 1990 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another usage example includes 'a militant political activist',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ask.com/web?q=dictionary%3A+militant&amp;content=ahdict%7C62622&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir |title=American Heritage Dictionary |publisher=Ask.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing attention to behaviours typical of those engaged in intensive political activism. The political protests headed by the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] have been described as militant in nature in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-1118403.html ''[[The Washington Post]]'', by Howard Kurtz, 30 March 1990.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "militant" is sometimes used to describe groups that do not name or describe themselves as militants, but that advocate [[extreme violence]]. In the early 21st Century, members of groups involved in [[Islamic terrorism]] such as [[Al-Qaeda]]  and [[ISIS]] are usually described as militants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13801385 BBC: Nigeria blast blamed on Islamic militant group Boko Haram.] Example of use of "militant" to describe a group suspected of carrying out a [[suicide bombing]](Boko Haram)&lt;/ref&gt;

==As noun==
A ''militant'', as a noun, is a person who uses militant methods in pursuit of an objective;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/militant_7#militant_11 Macmillan dictionary definition of militant as noun]&lt;/ref&gt; the term is not associated with the military. In general usage, a ''militant'' person is a ''confrontational'' person who does not necessarily use violence. ''Militant'' can refer to individuals or groups displaying aggressive behavior or attitudes.

''Militant'' is sometimes used as a [[euphemism]] for ''terrorist'' or ''armed insurgent''.&lt;ref name="SandersDecoding" /&gt; (For more on this, see [[#Mass media usage|mass media usage]] below.)

''Militant'' is often used within some religious circles to denote the continuous battle of Christians (as church members) or the [[Christian Church]] in their struggle against sin. In particular, the Roman Catholic Church differentiates between [[Church militant and church triumphant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/THEOLOGY/SPIRCATH.HTM#07 |title=Catholic View of Church Militant – Theology |publisher=Ewtn.com |date=12 January 1935 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/faith/Teachings/chura1.htm |title=Catholic View of Church Militant – Teachings |publisher=Ewtn.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellen G. White]], one of the founders of the [[Seventh-day Adventist church]], says "Now the church is militant. Now we are confronted with a world in darkness, almost wholly given over to idolatry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteestate.org/books/mh/mh43.html |title=The Ministry of Healing, page 504 |publisher=Whiteestate.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such religious meaning must not be confused with the word '[[belligerent]]' used to describe extremist religious behaviours found in some who, based on their extreme religious beliefs or ideologies, take up weapons and become involved in warfare, or who commit acts of violence or terrorism in an attempt to advance their extremist religious agendas. Such extremist groups can be Christian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/b/2004/01/12/thanks-be-to-god-and-christian-terrorists.htm |title=Terrorism by Christians |publisher=Atheism.about.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiwar.com/eland/?articleid=14244 |title=Third Article on Terrorism by Christians |publisher=Antiwar.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muhammadanism.org/Terrorism/Terrorist_Mind.htm |title=Terrorism by Muslim |publisher=Muhammadanism.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean O’Neill, Zahid Hussain and Michael Evans |url=http://sheikyermami.com/2009/04/14/uk-prosecuting-islamic-terrorists-will-only-create-more-islamic-terrorists/ |title=More terrorism by Muslims |publisher=Sheikyermami.com |date=12 April 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Mark Gabriel |url=http://www.internationalwallofprayer.org/A-052-Why-Islamic-Terrorists-Do-What-They-Do-Dr-Mark-Gabriel.html |title=Third Article on Terrorism by Muslims |publisher=Internationalwallofprayer.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewebfairy.com/nerdcities/Palestine/terror-against-british.htm |title=Jewish Terrorism Against the British |publisher=Thewebfairy.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/jan/28/jewish-terrorism-government-action |title=More Terrorism by Jews |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=28 January 1947 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Judith Apter Klinghoffer |url=http://hnn.us/articles/832.html |title=Third Article on Terrorism by Jews |publisher=Hnn.us |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or of any other religious affiliation.

==Mass media usage==
Newspapers, magazines, and other information sources may deem ''militant'' a neutral term,&lt;ref&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark. Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence. Comparative studies in religion and society, 13. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''terrorist''&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jackson, Jeroen Gunning, Marie Breen Smyth, Critical Terrorism Studies: A New Research Agenda. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2009. Page 162.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]''&lt;ref&gt;Peloso, Vincent C. Work, Protest, and Identity in Twentieth-Century Latin America. Jaguar books on Latin America, no. 26. Wilmington, Del: Scholarly Resources, 2003. Page 238.&lt;/ref&gt; conventionally indicates disapproval of the behavior of the individual or organization so labeled, regardless of the motivations for such behavior. ''Militant'', at other times, can refer to anyone not a member of formal [[armed forces]] engaging in warfare or serving as a [[combatant]].

The mass media sometimes uses the term "''militant''" in the context of terrorism.&lt;ref name="SandersDecoding" /&gt; Journalists sometimes apply the term ''militant'' to [[paramilitary]] movements using terrorism as a tactic. The mass media also has used the term ''militant groups'' or ''radical militants'' for terrorist organizations.&lt;ref name="SandersDecoding"&gt;Sanders, Clinton. Marginal Conventions: Popular Culture, Mass Media, and Social Deviance. Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 1990. Decoding the Mass Media and Terrorism Connection. Page 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wilkinson, ''Homeland security in the UK: future preparedness for terrorist attack since 9/11''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2007. Page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savitch, H. V. Cities in a Time of Terror: Space, Territory, and Local Resilience. Cities and contemporary society. Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 2008. Page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal inferences===
Those resisting a foreign military occupation can be seen as not meriting the label ''terrorists'' because their acts of political violence against military targets of a foreign occupier do not violate international law. Protocol 1 of the [[Geneva Conventions]] gives lawful combatant status to those engaging in armed conflicts against alien (or foreign) [[Military occupation|occupation]], [[colonialism|colonial domination]] and racist [[regime|régimes]]. Non-uniformed guerrillas also gain combatant status if they carry [[weapon|arms]] openly during [[military operation]]s. Protocol 1 does not legitimize attacks on civilians by militants who fall into these categories.

In the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] Resolution on terrorism (42/159, 7 December 1987). which condemns international terrorism and outlines measures to combat the crime, with one proviso: "that nothing in the present resolution could in any way prejudice the right to self-determination, freedom and independence, as derived from the [[Charter of the United Nations]], of peoples forcibly deprived of that right [...], particularly peoples under colonial and racist regimes and foreign occupation or other forms of colonial domination, nor...the right of these peoples to struggle to this end and to seek and receive support [in accordance with the Charter and other principles of international law]."

==Span of militancy==
Militants occur across the [[political spectrum]], including racial or religious [[Supremacism|supremacists]], [[separatist]]s, abortion opponents and proponents, and environmentalists. Examples of left-wing, right-wing, and [[advocacy group]] militants include militant reformers, militant feminists, militant [[animal rights]] advocates, and militant anarchists. The phrase ''[[militant Islam]]'' can suggest violent and aggressive political activity by Islamic individuals, groups, movements, or governments. Various secret societies that have been known to be militarists are known as militant.

Using the [[U.S. president|president]]’s authority to assassinate people worldwide who pose an “imminent threat” if “capture is not feasible",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Williams |url=http://www.themilitant.com/2012/7624/762403.html |title=Obama: less rights, more drones–don’t worry, it’s legit  |publisher=''The Militant'' |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Obama administration routinely called every victim of [[extrajudicial killing]] a militant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Michael Boyle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/11/obama-drone-wars-normalisation-extrajudicial-killing |title=Obama's drone wars and the normalisation of extrajudicial murder  |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=11 June 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Among organisations that describe themselves as militants, the [[Ulster Young Militants]] are an example of a group resorting to violence (intimidation, arson, and murder) as a deliberate tactic.

==Militant research==
Militant research is defined as a type of research that is distinct from academia while also not synonymous with the political militant. It refuses the alienating practices of academia which separate researchers from the political meaning of their activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Colectivo Situaciones |url=http://eipcp.net/transversal/0406/colectivosituaciones/en |title=On the researcher militant  |publisher=''EIPCP'' |date=Sep 2003 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years it has become an increasingly popular approach for doing research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sam Halversen |url=https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/area.12221 |title=Militant research against‐and‐beyond itself: critical perspectives from the university and Occupy London |publisher=''Area'' |date=9 Sep 2015 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially since it attempt to resolve academic concerns related to representation and auto-critique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Jared Sacks |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02589346.2018.1523349 |title=On Militancy, Self-reflection, and the Role of the Researcher |publisher=''Politikon'' |date=20 Sep 2018 |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moldovans''' or '''Moldavians''' (in [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]/[[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''moldoveni'' {{IPA-ro|moldoˈvenʲ|pron}}; [[Moldovan Cyrillic]]: Молдовень) are the largest ethnic group of the [[Republic of Moldova]] (75.1% of the population, as of 2014), and a significant minority in [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]]. Under the variant '''Moldavians''', the term may also be used to refer to all inhabitants of the territory of historical [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]], currently divided among [[Romania]] (47.5%), Moldova (30.5%) and [[Ukraine]] (22%), regardless of ethnic identity.

This article refers to the [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]/[[Romanian language]]-speaking population native to the Republic of Moldova, the historical [[Bessarabia]] and diaspora originating from these regions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=32532 "Official Chisinau Seeks Recognition Of Moldovan Ethnicity And Minority In Romania"] The Jamestown Foundation, February 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; self-identified as Moldovans (in Moldova, another 7% of the Moldovan/Romanian language-speaking native population self-identified as [[Romanians]]).

==History==

[[File:Moldova 1483 EnglishPNG.png|thumb|left|The Principality of Moldavia in the 15th century]]
According to [[Miron Costin]], a prominent chronicler from the 17th century [[Moldavia]], the inhabitants of the Principality of [[Moldavia]] spoke Romanian and called themselves "Moldovans", but also "Romanians" which, he notes, comes from "[[Rome|romanus]]".&lt;ref&gt;Miron Costin, De neamul moldovenilor. Şi acum mulţi ne zic noao, ţării noastre [Moldova] şi Ţării Muntenéşti, streinii, Daţiia, însă norodul, neamul lăcuitorilor, nu ş-au schimbatŭ numele său, ci tot romanus, apoi cu vréme şi îndelungate vacuri romani, apoi rumâni pănă astăzi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miron Costin, De neamul moldovenilor. Aşa şi neamul acésta, de carele scriem, al ţărâlor acestora, numele vechiŭ şi mai direptŭ ieste rumân, adecă râmlean, [...] tot acest nume au ţinut şi ţin pănă astăzi şi încă mai bine munténii decât moldovénii, că ei şi acum zic şi scriu ţara sa rumânească, ca şi românii cei din Ardeal.

Şi aşa ieste acestor ţări şi ţărâi noastre, Moldovei şi Ţărâi Munteneşti numele cel direptŭ de moşie, ieste rumân, cum să răspundŭ şi acum toţi acéia din Ţările Ungureşti lăcuitori şi munténii ţara lor şi scriu şi răspundŭ cu graiul: Ţara Românească&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[Slavs|Slavic]] neighbours called Moldovans "[[Vlachs]]" or "Volokhs", a term equally used to refer to all native Romance speakers from [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Balkan peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger-William Seton Watson, A history of the Romanians, Cambridge University Press, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

As the ethnonym "Romanian" was gaining more and more popularity throughout [[Western Moldavia]] and [[Bukovina]] during the 19th century, its dissemination in Bessarabia, a more backward and rural province of the [[Russian Empire]] at the time, was welcomed mostly by the Romanian-oriented intellectuals, while the majority of the rural population continued to use the old self-identification "Moldovans".&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Petrescu, "[http://mek.niif.hu/06000/06046/06046.pdf Contrasting/Conflicting Identities:Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans]" in Nation-Building and Contested Identities, Polirom, 2001, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, ''Moldovan Identity and the Politics of Pan-Romanianism'', Slavic Review, Vol. 53, No. 2. (Summer, 1994), pp. 345-368.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1920s, historians generally considered Moldovans as a subgroup of the Romanian ethnos.&lt;ref&gt;King, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; After 1924, within the newly created [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], Soviet authorities supported the creation of a different standardized language (see [[Moldovan language]]) allegedly in order to prove that Moldovans form a separate ethnic group.&lt;ref name=page3&gt;King, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bruchis. ''The Language Policy of the CPSU and the Linguistic Situation in Soviet Moldavia'', in ''[[Soviet Studies]]'', Vol. 36, No. 1. (Jan., 1984), pp. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sprachatlas Weigand 65.JPG|thumb|right|A 1908 map of Romanian dialects (Banat, Moldovan, Muntenian) by [[Gustav Weigand]]]]

In the past, the term "Moldovan" has been used to refer to the population of the historical Principality of Moldavia. However, for the inhabitants of Bessarabia living under the Russian rule, the term gained an ethnic connotation by the beginning of the 20th century: in May 1917, at a congress of Bessarabian teachers, a dispute arose over the identification of the native population; a group protested against being called "Romanians", affirming they were "Moldovan",&lt;ref&gt;Stuart J. Kaufman, ''Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War'', [[Cornell University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-8014-8736-1}}, pg. 134&lt;/ref&gt; while another group, led by poet [[Alexei Mateevici]], supported the view that the Moldovans are also Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Cuvântarea_la_primul_congres_al_învăţătorilor_moldoveni_din_Basarabia Mateevici's speech at the teachers' congress] at Romanian wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Bessarabia [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|joined]] the [[Kingdom of Romania]], following a vote of [[Sfatul Ţării]]. The circumstance of the vote was itself complex, since the Romanian troops were present in Bessarabia at the request of the Sfatul Ţării as it was facing exterior threats and anarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, ''The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture'', Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000, page 33 "The occupation of Bessarabia by the Romanian[s troops], although carried out after an appeal of members of the Sfatul Tarii and other Moldovan organizations, was not universally welcomed"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, Cristina. ''Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans'' in Nation-Building and Contested identities: Romanian &amp; Hungarian Case Studies''. Editura [[Polirom]]. 2001. As Sorin Alexandrescu suggests, taking into account the situation at that time, the chaos in Russia and the undecided balance in the war, it is reasonable to suppose that the presence of Romanian troops in Bessarabia created a situation in which the majority in the Sfatul Tãrii decided to rally the faction that was advocating the union with Romania as a solution for overcoming of the triple threat of Bolshevism, Ukrainian expansionism and general anarchy.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Romania MASSR 1920.png|thumb|left|Map depicting the borders of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] (1918-1940) and the M.A.S.S.R. to the east.]]

By the time of the union, the largely illiterate Romanian-speaking peasants of Bessarabia did not consider themselves part of a larger Romanian nation, and there was no mass nationalist movement as in other regions, such as in [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, Irina. ''Cultural Politics in Greater Romania: Regionalism, Nation Building, and Ethnic Struggle, 1918-1930''. [[Cornell University Press]], 2000. pp. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

The unified Romanian state promoted a common identity for all its Romanian-speaking inhabitants. Owing partly to its relative underdevelopment compared to other regions of [[Greater Romania]], as well as to the low competence and corruption of the new Romanian administration in this province, the integration process of Bessarabia in the unified Romanian state was less successful than in other regions and was soon to be disrupted by the Soviet occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, Cristina. ''Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans'' in Nation-Building and Contested identities: Romanian &amp; Hungarian Case Studies''. Editura [[Polirom]]. 2001.

"The members of this overwhelmingly rural, mostly illiterate and quasi-immobile peasant population, who had no sense of national identification with the Romanians, but had idealized memories from the Tsarist period, found themselves overnight citizens of Romania. It was the transition from the Tsarist-type of local government to the Romanian-type of centralized modern state with a corrupt administration that alienated the Bessarabians, many of whom felt, as the interviewed persons bear witness, that they were rather occupied by their alleged brothers than united with them."  (page 157)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, Cristina. Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans in Nation-Building and Contested identities: Romanian &amp; Hungarian Case Studies.

"The stories told by a group of Bessarabians coming from several villages of Bălți county, who, it should be noted, chose to come to Romania instead of living under the Soviet regime, seems to suggest that their native region was the only province acquired after World War I where the Romanian central authorities did not succeed in integrating their own coethnics, among whom some even felt nostalgia for the Tsarist period. Although citizens of Greater Romania, a large majority of Bessarabians did not even begin to consider themselves part of the Romanian nation, going beyond their allegiance to regional and local ties.11 In short, as these oral history interviews reveal, during the interwar period, the Romanian homogenizing state failed in its attempt to transform the peasants of Bessarabia into Romanians." (page 154)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, during [[World War II]], Romania agreed to an [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|ultimatum]] and ceded the region to the [[Soviet Union]], which organized it into the [[Moldavian SSR]]. The Soviets began a campaign to strengthen the Moldovan identity different from that of the rest of [[Romanian language|Romanian]] speakers, taking advantage of the incomplete integration of the Bessarabia into the interwar Romania (see also [[Moldovenism]]).&lt;ref&gt;King,
The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture; Mackinlay, pg. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The official Soviet policy also stated that Romanian and Moldovan were two different languages and, to emphasize this distinction, Moldovan had to be written in a new Cyrillic alphabet (the [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet]]) based on the Russian Cyrillic, rather than the older Romanian Cyrillic that ceased to be used in the 19th century in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] and 1917 in Bessarabia.&lt;ref&gt;Mackinlay, pg. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity and politics in the Republic of Moldova==
{{See also|Controversy over ethnic and linguistic identity in Moldova}}
A poll conducted in the Republic of Moldova by IMAS-Inc [[Chișinău]] in October 2009 presented a detailed picture. The respondents were asked to rate the relationship between the identity of Moldovans and that of [[Romanians]] on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll showed that 26% of the entire sample, which included all ethnic groups, claimed the two identities were the same or very similar, whereas 47% claimed they were different or entirely different.

The results varied significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, while 33% of the young respondents (ages 18–29) chose the same or very similar and 44% different or very different, among the senior respondents (aged over 60) the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. The proportion of those who chose the same or very similar identity was higher than the average among the native speakers of Romanian/Moldovan (30%), among the urban dwellers (30%), among those with higher education (36%), and among the residents of the capital city (42%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interlic.md/download/988/|title=ABCD|website=Interlic.md|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study conducted in the Republic of Moldova in May 1998, when the self-declared Moldovans were asked to relate the Romanian and Moldovan identities,  55% considered them somewhat different, 26% very different and less than 5% identical.&lt;ref&gt;Pal Kolsto, Hans Olav Melberg ''National Integration and Violent Conflict in Post-Soviet Societies: The Cases of Estonia and Moldova'', pg. 31-34, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7425-1888-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey carried out in the Republic of Moldova in 1992 showed that 87% of the Romanian/Moldovan speakers chose to identify themselves as "Moldovans", rather than "Romanians".&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, "The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture", Hoover Press, 2000, pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

The major Moldovan political forces have diverging opinions regarding the identity of Moldovans. This contradiction is reflected in their stance towards the national history that should be taught in schools. Governing forces such as the [[Liberal Party (Moldova)|Liberal Party]], [[Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova|Liberal Democratic Party]], and [[Our Moldova Alliance]] support the teaching of the history of Romanians. Others, such as the [[Democratic Party (Moldova)|Democratic Party]] and the Party of Communists support the history of the Republic of Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adevarul.ro/international/europa/istoria-romanilor-scolile-moldovene-vlad-filat-vrea-marian-lupu-nu-1_50ad27ce7c42d5a6638fb911/index.html|title=Vlad Filat, president of PLDM : "Vom învăţa istoria noastră  - cea a românilor, aşa cum este şi firesc"/"We will teach our history - that of Romanians, as it is natural"  Marian Lupu, president of PD: "După părerea noastră, cea mai bună variantă [...] ar fi istoria statului nostru – istoria Republicii Moldova.

The diverging opinions are also reflected in the official state documents issued in successive legislatures. The Declaration of Independence of 1991 calls the official language "Romanian",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europa.md/upload/File/alte_documente/Declaratia%20de%20Independenta%20a%20Republicii%20Moldova%202(1).doc] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305220335/http://www.europa.md/upload/File/alte_documente/Declaratia%20de%20Independenta%20a%20Republicii%20Moldova%202(1).doc |date=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first anthem adopted by the independent Republic of Moldova was "[[Deşteaptă-te, române]]" ("Awaken thee, Romanian!"), the same as the anthem of [[Romania]].

Mirroring different political configurations of the later [[Moldovan Parliament]], the [[Constitution of Moldova (1994)]] calls the official language "Moldovan",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Constitution of the Republic of Moldova. Article 13, Chapter 1 |date=1994-06-29 |quote= The official language of the Republic of Moldova is Moldovan, written in Latin script.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the "Concept of the National Policy of the Republic of Moldova" (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=L E G E privind aprobarea Conceptiei politicii nationale de stat a Republicii Moldova  |url=http://lex.justice.md/viewdoc.php?action=view&amp;view=doc&amp;id=312846&amp;lang=1|website=Lex.justice.md|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gribincea A., Grecu, M.

On December 5, 2013, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Moldova ruled that the Romanian language is the official language of this country, in agreement with the Declaration of Independence of 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205403800_text|title=Global Legal Monitor: Moldova: Romanian Recognized as the Official Language - Global Legal Monitor - Law Library of Congress - Library of Congress|website=Loc.gov|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constcourt.md/libview.php?l=en&amp;idc=7&amp;id=512&amp;t=/Overview/Press-Service/News/The-text-of-the-Declaration-of-Independence-prevails-over-the-text-of-the-Constitution|title=The text of the Declaration of Independence prevails over the text of the Constitution|website=Constcourt.md|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectuals of Moldova and the Romanian identity===
A significant number of intellectuals from the Bessarabia considered themselves part of the Romanian nation in the passing of time. Amongst these prominent figures, there are the following ones:

* Alexei Mateevici (1888–1917), author of the Moldovan national anthem ''[[Limba noastră]]'' said at a congress of Bessarabian teachers in 1917: "Yes, we are Moldovans, sons of the old Moldavia, but we belong to the large body of the Romanian nation, that lives in Romania, Bukovina and Transylvania. Our brothers from Bukovina, Transylvania and Macedonia don't call themselves after the places they live in, but call themselves Romanians. That is what we should do as well!"&lt;ref&gt;"Da, suntem moldoveni, fii ai vechii Moldove, însă facem parte din marele trup al românismului, aşezat prin România, Bucovina şi Transilvania. Fraţii noştri din Bucovina, Transilvania şi Macedonia nu se numesc după locurile unde trăiesc, ci-şi zic români. Aşa trebuie să facem şi noi!" Alexei Mateevici, Opere, vol. I, Chişinău, Ştiinţa, 1993, p. 463, după „Şcoala moldovenească”, an. 1, nr. 2 - 4, iulie-septembrie, 1917, p. 55 - 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Emanoil Catelli]] (1883–1943) a politician of the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], and later of [[Romania]], said in 1917: "The Moldovans who remained silent for 106 years, should speak louder today [...] because they are Romanians, and only the Russians demoted them to the role of 'Moldovans.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.literaturasiarta.md/pressview.php?l=ro&amp;idc=115&amp;id=730&amp;zidc=1|title=Literatura şi Arta|website=Literaturasiarta.md|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Alexandru Averescu]] (1859-1938), a Romanian marshal and politician originary from Bessarabia, lead the Romanian troops in 1918 and reached an agreement with the Allied Powers, recognizing Bessarabia's union with Romania.
* [[Maria Cebotari]] (1910–1949) one of the most famous sopranos born in [[Bessarabia]] said "Never and in no circumstance has it crossed my mind to say that I am anything else than a Romanian from Bessarabia, or, simply, a Romanian."&lt;ref&gt;(Romanian) „Niciodata si in nici o imprejurare nu mi-a trecut prin cap sa spun altceva decit ca sunt românca din Basarabia sau, pur si simplu, - românca.“ {{cite web|url=http://punkt.md/revista/citeste/articol/in_hac_habitasse_platea_dictumst/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722171341/http://punkt.md/revista/citeste/articol/in_hac_habitasse_platea_dictumst///nb/1/nc/3.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}//nb/1/nc/3.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Grigore Vieru]] (1935–2009), prominent Moldovan poet, a staunch supporter of Pan-Romanianism, wrote: "Moldovans hurt me too/Inhumanly/But I'm happy that Romanianness/Still lives in them" (Bessarabia with Sorrow)&lt;ref&gt;"In mine-au dat si moldovenii/Necrestineste/Ci-s fericit ca-n ei romanul/Tot mai traieste" (Basarabie cu jale).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Eugen Doga]] (b. 1937), a famous Moldovan composer, explained in an interview his visit to [[Alba-Iulia]], Romania: "This is the capital of the unification, a real Mecca [...].

The resolution  of the "[[Association of Historians from the Republic of Moldova]]" (AIRM) from October 28, 2009 in favor of teaching the history of Romanians in Moldovan schools reads "The people of the Moldovan SSR were subjected to the Communist ideology, with the aim of replacing the Romanian identity of the native population, with one newly created"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airm.reg.md/wp/?p=287 Populaţia R.S.S.M. a fost supusă ideologiei comuniste, care avea scopul de a înlocui identitatea românească, a majorității populației locale, cu alta, nou creată.]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903131409/http://www.airm.reg.md/wp/?p=287 |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national poet of Moldova and Romania, [[Mihai Eminescu]] was born and lived outside of the territory of the current Republic of Moldova and considered himself Romanian. He is often quoted as saying "''We are Romanians, period. (Suntem români şi punct)''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timpul.md/articol/suntem-romni-si-punctum-2093.html|title=Suntem romni si punctum!|work=Timpul - Ştiri din Moldova|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

The [[2014 Moldovan Census|2014 census]] reported an estimated 2,998,235 people (without [[Transnistria]]), out of which 2,804,801 were actually covered by the census. Among them, 2,068,068 or 73.7% declared themselves Moldovans and 192,800 or 6.9% [[Romanians]].

Some organisations like the [[Liberal Party (Moldova)|Liberal party of Moldova]] have criticised the census results, claiming [[Romanians]] comprise 85% of the population and that census officials have pressured respondents to declare themselves Moldovans instead of [[Romanians]] and have purposefully failed to cover urban respondents who are more likely to declare themselves [[Romanians]] as opposed to Moldovans &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inprofunzime.protv.md/stiri/politic/partidul-liberal-despre-datele-recensamantului-din-2014-prezentate.html|title=Partidul Liberal despre datele Recensamantului din 2014, prezentate abia astazi, in 2017: "Sunt viciate si nu reflecta realitatea din Republica Moldova"|website=inprofunzime.protv.md}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2004 Moldovan Census|previous 2004 census]] results reported that out of the 3,383,332 people living in Moldova (without [[Transnistria]]), 2,564,849 or 75.81% declared themselves Moldovans and only 73, 276 or 2.17% [[Romanians]].&lt;ref name="mold-census"&gt;National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova: [http://www.statistica.md/recensamint.php?lang=ro 2004 Census results in Moldova] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311020813/http://www.statistica.md/recensamint.php?lang=ro |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of international observers considered the census was generally conducted in a professional manner, although they reported several cases when enumerators encouraged respondents to declare themselves Moldovans rather than Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2006/04/printable/060410_moldova_recensamant_limba.shtml|title=BBCRomanian.com|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 census in Ukraine]] counted 258,600 Moldovans and 150,989 Romanians. The self-identified Moldovans live mostly in the southern and northern areas of historical Bessarabia (specifically in the [[Budjak]] region of the [[Odessa oblast]] and in the [[Novoselytskyi Raion]] of [[Chernivtsi oblast]]), whereas the self-identified Romanians live mostly in Northern Bukovina and [[Hertza region]] of the [[Chernivtsi oblast]].&lt;ref name=ukr-census&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/nationality_population/nationality_1/s5/?botton%3Dcens_db%26box%3D5.1W%26k_t%3D00%26p%3D60%26rz%3D1_1%26rz_b%3D2_1 |title=2001 census results in Ukraine |accessdate=February 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130163603/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/nationality_population/nationality_1/s5/?botton=cens_db&amp;box=5.1W&amp;k_t=00&amp;p=60&amp;rz=1_1&amp;rz_b=2_1 |archivedate=January 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Russia]], 156,400 Moldovans have been counted in the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Russian census]]. They are concentrated mostly in [[Moscow]], but also in some rural areas in [[Kuban]], southern [[Siberia]], and  the [[Russian Far East]], where they were deported generations ago. Around 14,000 Moldovans live in [[Kazakhstan]], mostly in the former capital [[Almaty]], but also in some rural areas in the northern parts of the country (another destination of Soviet deportations).

==Regional identity in Romania==

The largest share (47.5%) of the territory of the historical [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]] together with all its formal capitals ([[Baia|Târgul Moldovei]], [[Suceava]] and [[Iaşi]]) and the famous [[Painted churches of northern Moldavia|painted churches]] are located in Romania. The river [[Moldova River|Moldova]] (possibly, the origin of the name of the Principality, see ''[[Etymology of Moldova]]'') now flows entirely through Romania. After the Russian annexation of [[Bessarabia]] in 1812, and Austrian annexation of [[Bukovina]] in 1775, the rest of Moldova united with [[Wallachia]] and formed the modern Romania.

In 1998, Constantin Simirad, the former mayor of [[Iaşi]] founded the Party of the Moldavians ''(Partidul Moldovenilor)'' which later joined the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziua.net/display.php?data=2001-11-19&amp;id=76849] {{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the party's declared objective was to represent the interests of the Moldavia region in Romania rather than any ethnic identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/local/vaslui/costantin-simirad-a-pus-la-vaslui-bazele-partidului-moldovenilor~ni432|title=Costantin Simirad a pus, la Vaslui, bazele Partidului Moldovenilor|author=Ziarul de Iasi|website=Ziaruldeiasi.ro|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Romanian census of 2002, there are 4.7 million Romanian speakers in the eight counties that were once part of the Principality of Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recensamant.ro/|title=Tabelele integrale din fiecare volum sunt tiparite în serie limitata si publicate si pe CD-ROM.

In February 2007, a small group of Romanian citizens who created the "Moldovan/Moldavian Community in Romania" (Comunitatea moldovenilor din România) attempted unsuccessfully to gain recognition of the minority status for Moldovans from Romania. The organization was initially registered legally, but the decision was soon reverted. Around the same time, during a visit to [[Moldova]], three delegates met with President [[Vladimir Voronin]], who promised them his support. Being denied legal recognition the Community eventually dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2007/02/070226_profil_marian_russo.shtml|title=BBCRomanian.com|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obiectivdesuceava.ro/index.php?page=articol&amp;ids=27359|title=Comunitatea Moldovenilor din România se va autodizolva|website=Objectivdesuceava.ro|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Romania, the Moldovans from [[Bessarabia]] region (contemporary Republic of [[Moldova]] included) are usually called Bessarabians ''(basarabeni)'' in order to distinguish them from the inhabitants of [[Western Moldavia|Eastern Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basarabeni.ro/|title=Basarabeni.Ro|website=Basarabeni.Ro|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion in Moldova==
{{Main|Moldovan Orthodox Church|Metropolis of Bessarabia}}
The major [[Christian denomination|denomination]] in Moldova is [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. The majority of Moldovan Orthodox Christians belong to the [[Moldovan Orthodox Church]], a branch of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], while a minority belongs to the [[Metropolis of Bessarabia]], a branch of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. Both bodies are in [[full communion]], the dispute between them being purely territorial and revolves around the legitimate succession of the interwar Metropolitan [[Episcopal see|See]] of Bessarabia. As of 2007, the Moldovan Orthodox Church has 1255 parishes, while the Metropolis of Bessarabia has 219.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90189.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007], by the US Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Mswati III is one of many sons fathered by the previous king, [[Sobhuza II]] (who had more than 125 wives during his reign of 82 years),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2335941.stm | work=BBC News | title='Mother-in-law' sues Swazi king | date=17 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only child of [[Ntfombi of Swaziland|Ntfombi Tfwala]], also known as ''Inkhosikati'' LaTfwala, one of Sobhuza's younger wives. He was born at the Raleigh Fitkin Memorial Hospital in [[Manzini, Swaziland|Manzini]], four months before Swaziland attained independence from the [[United Kingdom]]. When he and his mother were discharged from the hospital, they went to live at one of Sobhuza's residences, Etjeni, near the Masundwini royal residence. His birth name was Makhosetive (lit. "Kings of Nations").

As a young prince, Makhosetive attended Masundwini Primary School and later Lozitha Palace School. He sat for the Swaziland Primary Certificate examination in December 1982 at Phondo Royal Residence and received First Class with merit in Mathematics and English. He developed a great interest in the royal guard, becoming the first young cadet to join the [[Military of Swaziland|Umbutfo Swaziland Defence Force (USDF)]].

When King Sobhuza II died on 21 August 1982, the Great Council of State (the ''Liqoqo'') selected the 14-year-old prince Makhosetive to be the next king.&lt;ref&gt;Simelane, Hamilton Sipho. (2005).

==Kingship==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:King of Swaziland.jpg|thumb|left|King Mswati at the Reed Dance 2006]]
Mswati was introduced as Crown Prince in September 1983 and was crowned king on 25 April 1986, aged 18 years and 6 days, and thus making him the youngest reigning monarch until the ascension of King [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]] of [[Bhutan]] on 14 December 2006; he was also the youngest head of state until [[Joseph Kabila]] took office on 26 January 2001 as [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The king and his mother, whose title is ''Indlovukati'' ("Great She-Elephant"), rule jointly.

Today King Mswati III is Africa's last absolute monarch in the sense that he has the power to choose the prime minister, other top government posts and top traditional posts. Even though he makes the appointments, he still has to get special advice from the queen mother and council, for example when he chooses the prime minister. In matters of cabinet appointments, he gets advice from the prime minister.  He [[rule by decree|ruled by decree]], but did restore the nation's Parliament, which had been dissolved by his father in order to ensure concentration of power remained with the king.

In 2004, Mswati promulgated a new constitution that allows freedom of speech and assembly for the media and public, while retaining the traditional ''[[Tinkhundla]]'' system. [[Amnesty International]] has criticized the new constitution as inadequate in some respects.

In an attempt to mitigate the HIV and AIDS pandemic in 2001, the king used his traditional powers to invoke a time-honoured [[sexual abstinence|chastity]] [[rite]] (''[[umcwasho]]'') under the patronage of a princess, which encouraged all Swazi maidens to abstain from sexual relations for five years. This was last done under [[Sobhuza II]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="Kuipers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ozoutback.com.au/Swaziland/mcwasho_71/index.html |title=The uMcwasho Ceremony in 1971 |date=2014-03-10 |website=ozoutback.com.au |first=Ludo |last=Kuipers |publisher=OzOutback |location=Cairns, Queensland, Australia |accessdate=2014-04-26 |quote=Photos of the umcwasho Ceremony in 1971, in which girls finish a period of moral restrictions and dance in front of the King.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rite banned sexual relations for Swazis under 18 years of age from 9 September 2001 and 19 August 2005, but just two months after imposing the ban, he violated this decree when a ''liphovela'' (royal fiancée) was chosen, who became his 13th wife. As per custom, he was fined a cow by members of her regiment, which he duly paid.

Mswati has visited [[Taiwan]] seventeen times as of June 2018, and has promised to continue recognizing the [[Republic of China]] instead of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2018/06/09/2003694584 |publisher=''[[Taipei Times]]'' |title=Swazi king promises loyalty to Taiwan |first=Stacy |last=Hsu |date=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family and succession ==

[[File:Meeting with the Queens of the Kingdom of Swaziland by Mrs. Akie Abe July 26, 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Some of his wives meeting [[Akie Abe|the wife of the Japanese prime minister]]  in 2013]] 

The king currently has 15 wives and 23 children. A Swazi king's first two wives are chosen for him by the national councillors. There are complex rules on succession. Traditionally the king is chosen through his mother as represented in the Swazi saying ''Inkhosi, yinkhosi ngenina'', meaning "a king is king through his mother".&lt;ref name=Kgsh1&gt;{{cite journal| title=A ritual of kingship among the Swazi| author=Hilda Kuper| journal=Journal of the International African Institute|volume=14|number=5| year=1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, he can marry his fiancées only after they have fallen pregnant, proving they can bear heirs. Until then, they are termed ''liphovela'', or "brides".

==Controversies==
Mswati's reign has brought some changes in the government and political transformation. However, critics such as the [[People's United Democratic Movement]] (PUDEMO)&lt;ref name="PUDEMO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pudemo.org/images/Secretary_Generals_Historical_Documents/pudemo%20rejects%20the%20dlamini%20family%20constitution.pdf |title=PUDEMO rejects the Dlamini family constitution as it is meant to legitimize the continued oppression of our people by one family, King Mswati’s family |author=People's United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO) |authorlink=People's United Democratic Movement |last2=Dlamini |first2=Ignatius Bonginkosi |date=2005-07-31 |website=pudemo.org |publisher=PUDEMO |location=Swaziland |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that these changes are solely aimed at strengthening and perpetuating the traditional order.&lt;ref name="ISS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iss.co.za/uploads/SWAZIJUN03.PDF |title=Swaziland: The King’s Constitution |last=Maroleng |first=Chris |date=2003-06-26 |website=iss.co.za |publisher=[[European Union Institute for Security Studies]] |location=Paris, France |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808190714/http://www.iss.co.za/uploads/SWAZIJUN03.PDF |archivedate=2012-08-08 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attendance at the May 2012 Sovereign Monarchs lunch, to celebrate the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]] of  [[Queen Elizabeth II]], caused some controversy, given criticisms of his regime’s human rights record.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 2012-05-18"&gt;{{cite news |last1=The Daily Telegraph |author-link1=The Daily Telegraph |date=2012-05-18 |title=King of Bahrain lunches with Queen as human rights storm rages |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/9274690/King-of-Bahrain-lunches-with-Queen-as-human-rights-storm-rages.html |department=UK News |location=London, UK |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swaziland has been described as having been gripped by years of fiscal indiscipline, government corruption, and lavish lifestyles of the royal family. The nation has also been described as being on the brink of economic disaster due to these factors. Under Swazi law and custom, the king is vested with virtually all powers of the state.  Despite Swaziland having a prime minister, Mswati holds supreme executive authority over the legislature and courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =World Report 2012: Swaziland| work =Human Rights Watch| url =https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-swaziland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mswati's reign has been criticized for its several alleged human rights violations.  His regime has been accused of using torture and excessive force to control the masses as well as blatant discrimination against various dissenting groups.  His regime has been accused of extrajudicial killings by his forces, along with arbitrary arrests, detentions, and unwarranted searches and seizures of homes and property.  His government has restricted freedom of speech, assembly and association, and has harassed activists and journalists. The government has reportedly targeted the LGBT community, labor leaders, and activists against child labor, among other groups.  The courts took little or no action to punish Mswati's actions or the officials who committed the abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Swaziland| work =United States Department of State| url =https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/186458.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been accused of kidnapping women he desires to marry, although no case can be brought against him.  In addition, in 2000 he allegedly called for a parliamentary meeting to debate if HIV-positive people should be "sterilized and branded".&lt;ref name=mav/&gt;

===Wealth===

Mswati has been criticized for his lavish lifestyle, especially by the media; in one report he has been accused of living a lifestyle like this whilst the people of his country starve.&lt;ref name=tel18may&gt;{{cite news|title=King of Bahrain lunches with Queen as human rights storm rages|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/9274690/King-of-Bahrain-lunches-with-Queen-as-human-rights-storm-rages.html|accessdate=10 April 2013|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oleafrica.com/recent-post/king-mswati-is-bankrupting-swaziland-mornachy-not-for-africa/2777 King Mswati is Bankrupting Swaziland: Mornachy not for Africa!], ''Ole Africa''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2014 national budget, parliament allocated $61 million (US) for the King's annual household budget,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/14/king-mswati-iii-swaziland-increases-household-budget King of impoverished Swaziland increases household budget to $61m], Agence France-Presse in Mbabane, 15 May 2014, ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; while 63% of Swazis live on less than $1.25 per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sz.undp.org/content/swaziland/en/home/countryinfo/ UNDP], About Swaziland&lt;/ref&gt;  Following criticism of his purchase of luxury cars, including a $500,000 DaimlerChrysler's flagship [[Maybach 62]] luxury automobile, he banned the photography of his vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citypress.co.za/SouthAfrica/News/Now-only-Mswati-owns-a-Maybach-20100614 Now only Mswati owns a Maybach!], ''City Press'', 25 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Forbes 2009 list of the World's 15 Richest Royals, King Mswati is worth a reported $200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.forbes.com/global/2008/0901/038.html | work=Forbes | first=Tatiana | last=Serafin | title=The World's Richest Royals | date=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2004 the  ''[[Times of Swaziland]]'' reported that the king asked his government to spend about $15-million to redecorate three main palaces and build others for each of his 11 wives.&lt;ref name="R100"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=128&amp;fArticleId=323589|title=king needs R100m for palaces for 13 wives|date=13 April 2011|publisher=[[The Argus (South Africa)]]|accessdate=2011-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister's Office issued a press statement saying the article in the ''Times of Swaziland'' was "reckless and untrue" and that the proposal was for the construction of 5 State Houses, not Palaces, and the cost was only €19.9 million.&lt;ref name="pmo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.sz/home.asp?pid=3804 |title=The Issue of "€1 Million Spent on Princess Sikhanyiso" and The Issue of "Building" Royal Palaces by Swaziland Government |date=2004-01-26 |publisher=Prime Ministers Office |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126001057/http://www.gov.sz/home.asp?pid=3804 |archivedate=2007-11-26 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year the go-ahead was given to build five new buildings at a cost of more than $4-million out of [[Government spending|public funds]].&lt;ref name="goahead"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=84&amp;art_id=qw1090765262958B224|title=Swazi king gets go ahead for wives' palaces|date=25 July 2004|publisher=[[Independent Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, Swazi scouts marched through the capital protesting the cost of a shopping spree taken abroad by nine of the King's thirteen wives.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}{{clarify|reason=11 or 13?|date=May 2015}} The demonstration was organized by Positive Living, a non-governmental organization for Swazi women living with AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7574824.stm "Swazi anger at royal wives' trip,"] BBC News. 21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mswati has a personal stake in a large portion of Swaziland's economy which is a factor in its below-average economic growth for a Sub-Saharan nation.  As an absolute monarch, he holds the power to dissolve parties, and can veto any legislation parliament passes.&lt;ref name=mav&gt;{{cite web| last =Davis| first =Rebecca| title =King Mswati to WEF: Swazi people don’t want change| work =Daily Maverick| date =10 May 2013| url =http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-05-10-king-mswati-to-wef-swazi-people-dont-want-change/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LaMahlangu controversy===

According to accusations by [[Amnesty International]], Zena Mahlangu, an 18-year-old high school student, disappeared from her school in October 2002. Her mother, Lindiwe Dlamini, learned that her daughter had been taken by two men, Qethuka Sgombeni Dlamini and Tulujani Sikhondze, and she reported the matter to the police.  Some time later, she was told that her daughter was at [[Ludzidzini Royal Village]] and was being prepared to be the next wife of the king.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20041013054919/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAFR550042004?open&amp;of=ENG-SWZ "Swaziland: Human rights at risk in a climate of political and legal uncertainty,"Index No. AFR 55/004/2004.] 29 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; She demanded that her daughter be returned to her custody, and threatened to sue.

Among the criteria for a ''liphovela'', (future bride), the girl must not be disabled, or a twin; Zena Mahlangu was half of a brother-sister twin set, and therefore not eligible.&lt;ref name="wayua2002"&gt;Wayua, Muli. [http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/Supplements/saturday/14122002/story07121.htm "A king, his culture, his wives,"] ''[[Daily Nation]]'' (Nairobi, Kenya). 7 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  The matter went to the High Court, but Swaziland's Attorney-General [[Phesheya Dlamini]] intervened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/11/04/world/main528049.shtml "Swaziland's Royal Bridal Mess,"] CBS News. 4 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
She has since had two children, and formally became the king's wife in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201011070230.html|title=allAfrica.com: Uganda: Swaziland's King Mswati Iii Weds Again|date=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International said:
{{quote|The king and his agents have violated the internationally recognized human rights of women and girls, including their right not to be arbitrarily detained and the right not to be subjected to forced marriage.}}

== Name change ==
On 19th April 2018 King Mswati III changed the name of the country to Eswatini. The change was to mark the country's 50th anniversary of independence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/member-states/index.html#gotoE&lt;/ref&gt; Mswati III wanted the name Eswatini which is the ancient original name for the country and this change was to give up the previous colonial name Swaziland.&lt;ref&gt;https://allafrica.com/view/group/main/main/id/00060418.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As of late 2013, the library is constructing an [[audiovisual]] room.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Nablus Library's circulating collection includes approximately 80,000 books, the majority of which are in Arabic.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nablusguide.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78%3Anablus-library&amp;catid=34%3Ato-visit&amp;Itemid=59&amp;lang=en|title = The Nablus Library|work = Nablus Guide|publisher = [[Project Hope (Palestine)|Project Hope]]|accessdate = 28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the circulating collection, Nablus Library also houses several significant archival collections, including the so-called Prisoner's Section, an archive of materials made and used by [[Palestinian prisoners in Israel|Palestinian prisoners]] held in Israeli jails between 1975 and 1995, as well as the personal collection of Qadri Tuqan, a Nablusi educator and one of the founders of An-Najah College, now [[An-Najah National University]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://librarianswithpalestine.org/featured-projects-members/research-centers/prisoners-section-nablus-public-library/|title = Prisoner's Section, Nablus Public Library|date = |accessdate = April 12, 2015|website = Librarians with Palestine|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other collections include Palestinian newspapers dating back to the 1920s, as well as a collection of [[sharia]] court documents from northern Palestine spanning the length of the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Period]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nablus Library also houses [[Doctoral thesis|doctoral theses]] donated by students from An-Najah National University.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The collection includes 8,000 volumes of published books and 870 notebooks made and used by Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails between 1975 and 1995.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A large segment of the material is from the Nablus Jail, the veritable fount of the Palestinian prisoner self-education movement. Most Israeli jails in the 1960s did not have [[prison libraries]]; often books were prohibited. Nablus Jail was unique in that it included a small library for detainees, carried over from its time under Jordanian administration. A 1972 visit by the Red Cross concluded with the vast expansion of the library to include poetry, religious texts, books on [[Zionism]], [[Marxism]], [[Leninism]], and economic theory, among others. Utilizing this expanded library, detainees created a thriving intellectual culture within Nablus Jail; this self-education movement spread to other Israeli-operated detention facilities as well. Detainees at Nablus Jail often hand-copied books to send to other jails which lacked libraries.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://mondoweiss.net/2011/11/%E2%80%98a-needle-in-the-binding%E2%80%99-the-legacy-of-palestinian-prisoner-self-education-in-israeli-prisons|title = ‘A Needle in the Binding’: The legacy of Palestinian prisoner self-education in Israeli prisons|date = November 29, 2011|accessdate = April 12, 2015|website = Mondoweiss|publisher = |last = Lorber|first = Ben|last2 = Ashour|first2 = Khalil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[Oslo Accords]], several Israeli-operated detention facilities, including Nablus Jail, were closed. The contents of the prison libraries were donated to Nablus Library in 1996.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''North Levantine Arabic''' ({{lang-ar|اللهجة الشامي الشمال}}) is a subdivision of [[Levantine Arabic]], a [[variety of Arabic]]. 
It stems from the north in [[Turkey]], specifically in the coastal regions of the [[Adana Province|Adana]], [[Hatay Province|Hatay]], and [[Mersin Province|Mersin]] provinces,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/apc|title=Arabic, North Levantine Spoken|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/map/TR|title=Turkey|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Lebanon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/nort3139|title=Glottolog 3.2 - North Levantine Arabic|last=|first=|date=|website=glottolog.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; passing through the Mediterranean coastal regions of [[Syria]] (the [[Latakia Governorate|Latakia]] and [[Tartus Governorate|Tartus]] governorates) as well as the areas surrounding [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/map/JOSY|title=Jordan and Syria|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as '''Syro-Lebanese Arabic''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though that term is sometimes used to mean all of Levantine Arabic.&lt;ref name="Versteegh 2009"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/401165899 |title=Encyclopedia of Arabic language and linguistics |last=Versteegh |first=Kees |date=2009 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004177024 |location=Leiden |pages=170 |oclc=401165899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With over 24 million native speakers worldwide as of 2015,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Northern Levantine Arabic is used for daily speech mainly in Lebanon and Syria, while most of the written and official documents and media use [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. Its dialect continuum has been described as one of the two "''dominant (prestigeful) dialect centres of gravity for Spoken Arabic''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of the International Phonetic Association: A Guide to the Use of the International Phonetic Alphabet|last1=Decker|first1=Donald M.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780521637510|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|page=|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialects ==
* '''[[Languages of Syria#Arabic|Syria]]''': The [[Damascus Arabic|dialect of Damascus]] and the dialect of Aleppo are well-known.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''[[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanon]]''': North Lebanese, South Lebanese (Metuali, Shii), North-Central Lebanese (Mount Lebanon Arabic), South-Central Lebanese (Druze Arabic), Standard Lebanese, Beqaa, Sunni Beiruti, Saida Sunni, Iqlim-Al-Kharrub Sunni, Jdaideh&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''[[Çukurova]], [[Turkey]]''': Cilician/Çukurovan&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Literature ==
The [[Trinitarian Bible Society]] has published portions of the Bible in North Levantine Arabic: in 1939 they published the Gospel of Luke, in 1973 they published the Gospel of Matthew, and in 1981 they published the Book of Genesis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.language-archives.org/item/oai:rosettaproject.org:rosettaproject_apc_gen-1|title=The Book of Genesis in Lebanese|website=www.language-archives.org|others=The Long Now Foundation|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the First Letter to the Corinthians.

'''Oh Hyun-kyung''' (born Oh Sang-ji on March 25, 1970) is a [[South Korea]]n actress.

==Career==
Oh Sang-ji won the 1989 [[Miss Korea]] beauty pageant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://misskorea.hankooki.com/profile_view.php?year_miss=1989&amp;miss_num=2&amp;indexid=801 "오현경 (1989 미스코리아 진)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227085654/http://misskorea.hankooki.com/profile_view.php?year_miss=1989&amp;miss_num=2&amp;indexid=801 |date=2013-12-27 }} (in Korean). ''[[Miss Korea]]''. Retrieved 2013-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt; and represented her country at the [[Miss Universe 1990]] pageant. She immediately rose to stardom. Using the [[stage name]] Oh Hyun-kyung, she received many television offers and began acting. She was also briefly an [[Professor#Non-tenure-track positions|adjunct professor]] at [[:ko:공주영상대학교|Kongju Communication Arts College]]. But her career came to a halt in 1998 when a 28-minute video clip explicitly showing her having intercourse with her then-boyfriend was uploaded on file-sharing websites. Oh asked prosecutors to investigate the circumstances that led to the widespread circulation of the [[celebrity sex tape|sex video]], claiming that someone had earlier attempted to [[blackmail]] her for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chung|first=Byeong-seon|title=Oh Files Charges With Prosecution|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/1999/06/08/1999060861439.html|work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|date=8 June 1999|accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite proof that the video had been filmed without her consent and the boyfriend had released it with malicious intent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Park|first=Si-soo|title=''Right to be forgotten'' matters in Internet Age|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/02/116_104906.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-03-08|date=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scandal caused her to be harshly criticized in the media and Oh was forced to quit acting.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} She left the country for the United States, where she lived for three years and struggled economically.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2001 she returned to Korea and later found herself in the public eye once again after a hush-hush wedding in September 2002 to Kemongsa president Hong Seung-pyo (the [[Mergers and acquisitions|M&amp;A]] [[Shin Dong-hyuk (Hotelier)|specialist]] played by [[Bae Yong-joon]] in the TV series ''[[Hotelier (TV series)|Hotelier]]'' was based on Hong).&lt;ref name=wed&gt;{{cite web|last=Choi|first=Seung-hyun|title=Former Actress to Wed Businessman|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2002/08/19/2002081961024.html|work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|date=19 August 2002|accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oh gave birth to a daughter in 2003, and started a [[Golf equipment#Clothing|golf fashion]] business the year after. But in 2004 her husband Hong was arrested for [[embezzlement]], leading to Oh divorcing him in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Miss Korea Divorces Jailbird Husband|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2006/07/21/2006072161014.html|work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|date=21 July 2006|accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Troubled Oh Hyung-kyung "Headed for Stability"|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2006/09/01/2006090161022.html|date=1 September 2006|work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calling her 10-year self-imposed exile from the public limelight "a living nightmare," Oh returned to television in 2007 in the melodrama ''[[First Wives' Club]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sa|first=Eun-young|title=Actress Oh Comes Back After 10 Years|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2007/08/178_7989.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=8 August 2007|accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her acting comeback was a success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oh Hyun-kyung Rediscovers Her Love of Acting |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/12/05/2009120500228.html |work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|date=5 December 2009|accessdate=2013-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oh has since starred in a succession of [[Korean drama|dramas]], among them ''[[High Kick Through the Roof]]'', ''[[Gloria (2010 TV series)|Gloria]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hong|first1=Lucia|last2=Lee|first2=Ji-hye|title=Bae Doo-na was "worried over bad singing"|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2010072819023115910|work=10Asia|accessdate=2013-03-08|date=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Miss Ajumma]]'', ''[[The Great Seer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Tae-ho|title=''The Great Seer'' Cast Members Eager to Kick off New Historical Drama|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012092713520664652|work=10Asia|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''She Is Wow!'', ''[[Wang's Family]]'', ''[[Legendary Witches]]'', and ''The Bird That Sheds No Tears''.

The '''opioid epidemic''' or '''opioid crisis''' is the rapid increase in the use of prescription and non-prescription [[opioid]] drugs in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] beginning in the late 1990s and continuing throughout the next two decades. The increase in [[opioid overdose]] deaths has been dramatic, and opioids are now responsible for 49,000 of the 72,000 [[drug overdose]] deaths overall in the US in 2017.&lt;ref name=NIDA-deaths/&gt; The rate of prolonged opioid use is also increasing globally.&lt;ref name="Mohamadi 1332–1340"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mohamadi A, Chan JJ, Lian J, Wright CL, Marin AM, Rodriguez EK, von Keudell A, Nazarian A | title = Risk Factors and Pooled Rate of Prolonged Opioid Use Following Trauma or Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-(Regression) Analysis | journal = The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

Opioids are a diverse class of moderately strong [[analgesic|painkillers]], including [[oxycodone]] (commonly sold under the trade names [[OxyContin]] and [[oxycodone/paracetamol|Percocet]]), [[hydrocodone]] ([[hydrocodone/paracetamol|Vicodin]], [[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Norco]]), and a very strong painkiller, [[fentanyl]], which is synthesized to resemble other [[opiate]]s such as [[opium]]-derived [[morphine]] and [[heroin]]. The potency and availability of these substances, despite their high risk of [[drug addiction|addiction]] and [[drug overdose|overdose]], have made them popular both as medical treatments and as [[recreational drugs]]. Due to their [[sedative]] effects on the part of the brain which regulates breathing, the [[respiratory center]] of the [[medulla oblongata]], opioids in high doses present the potential for [[respiratory depression]], and may cause [[respiratory failure]] and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/information-sheet/en/|title=Information sheet on opioid overdose|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drug overdose]]s have become the leading cause of death of Americans under 50, with two-thirds of those deaths from opioids.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In 2016, the crisis decreased overall [[life expectancy]] of Americans for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/fueled-by-drug-crisis-us-life-expectancy-declines-for-a-second-straight-year/2017/12/20/2e3f8dea-e596-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html|title=Fueled by drug crisis, U.S. life expectancy declines for a second straight year|last=Bernstein|first=Lenny |last2=Ingraham|first2=Christopher | name-list-format = vanc |date=December 21, 2017|work=Washington Post|access-date=December 29, 2017 |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall life expectancy fell from 78.7 to 78.6 years. Men were disproportionately more affected due to higher overdose death rates, with life expectancy declining from 76.3 to 76.1 years. Women's life expectancy remained stable at 81.1 years.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

What the U.S. [[Surgeon General]] dubbed "The Opioid Crisis" likely began with over-prescription of [[opioids]] in the 1990s, which led to them becoming the most prescribed class of medications in the United States. Opioids initiated for post surgery or pain management are one of the leading causes of opioid misuse, where approximately 6% of people continued opioid use after trauma or surgery.&lt;ref name="Mohamadi 1332–1340"/&gt; When people continue to use opioids beyond what a doctor prescribes, whether to minimize pain or induce euphoric feelings, it can mark the beginning stages of an [[opiate addiction]], with a [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] developing and eventually leading to dependence, when a person relies on the drug to prevent [[withdrawal symptoms]].&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/08/health/opioids-overdose-deaths-epidemic-explainer/ "Why opioid overdose deaths seem to happen in spurts"], ''CNN'', February 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Writers have pointed to a widespread desire among the public to find a pill for any problem, even if a better solution might be a lifestyle change, such as exercise, improved diet, and stress reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/prescription-drugs/too-many-meds-americas-love-affair-with-prescription-medication/|title=Too many meds?

In the late 1990s, around 100 million people or a third of the U.S. population were estimated to be affected by [[chronic pain]]. This led to a push by drug companies and the federal government to expand the use of painkilling opioids.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt; In addition to this, organizations like the Joint Commission began to push for more attentive physician response to patient pain, referring to pain as the fifth vital sign. This exacerbated the already increasing number of opioids being prescribed by doctors to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Baker DW | date = 5 May 2017 | title = The Joint Commission's Pain Standards: Origin and Evolution | url = https://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/6/Pain_Std_History_Web_Version_05122017.pdf | publisher = The Joint Commission | location = Oakbrook Terrace, IL }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1991 and 2011, [[analgesic|painkiller]] prescriptions in the U.S. tripled from 76 million to 219 million per year, and as of 2016 more than 289 million prescriptions were written for opioid drugs per year.&lt;ref name="SurgeonGeneral"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/surgeon-generals-report.pdf  | title = Facing Addiction in America | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171019193303/https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/surgeon-generals-report.pdf | archive-date=October 19, 2017 | publisher = U.S. Surgeon General | date = 2016 | pages = 413 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} Mirroring the positive trend in the volume of opioid pain relievers prescribed is an increase in the admissions for substance abuse treatments and increase in opioid-related deaths. This illustrates how legitimate clinical prescriptions of pain relievers are being diverted through an illegitimate market, leading to misuse, addiction, and death.&lt;ref name="pmid23150006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander GC, Kruszewski SP, Webster DW | title = Rethinking opioid prescribing to protect patient safety and public health | journal = Jama | volume = 308 | issue = 18 | pages = 1865–6 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23150006 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2012.14282 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase in volume, the potency of opioids also increased. By 2002, one in six drug users were being prescribed drugs more powerful than [[morphine]]; by 2012, the ratio had doubled to one-in-three.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt; The most commonly prescribed opioids have been [[oxycodone]] and [[hydrocodone]].

First, there’s much less prescription of opioids for pain in Europe, so there’s less chance of addiction from people who started opioid use in a legal, medical way. Second, in many but not all European countries, the rate of illicit opioid use is either stagnant or decreasing."&lt;ref name=giz/&gt; While the rates of opioid prescriptions increased between 2001 and 2010, the prescription of non-opioid pain relievers (aspirin, ibuprofen, etc.) decreased from 38% to 29% of ambulatory visits in the same time period,&lt;ref name="pmid24025657"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daubresse M, Chang HY, Yu Y, Viswanathan S, Shah ND, Stafford RS, Kruszewski SP, Alexander GC | title = Ambulatory diagnosis and treatment of nonmalignant pain in the United States, 2000-2010 | journal = Medical Care | volume = 51 | issue = 10 | pages = 870–8 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24025657 | pmc = 3845222 | doi = 10.1097/MLR.0b013e3182a95d86 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has been no change in the amount of pain reported in the U.S.&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=SurgeonGeneral/&gt; This has led to differing medical opinions, with some noting that there is little evidence that opioids are effective for chronic pain not caused by [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=Prescriptions&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/health/opioid-painkillers-prescriptions-united-states.html?ribbon-ad-idx=5&amp;rref=us&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=context&amp;region=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=U.S.&amp;pgtype=article "Opioid Prescriptions Fall After 2010 Peak, C.D.C. Report Finds"], ''New York Times'', July 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual opioid prescribing rates has been slowly decreasing since 2012, but the number is still very high. There are about 58 opioid prescriptions per 100 Americans in 2017. Cities that are smaller, with more dentists and primary care doctors, or with higher uninsured/ unemployment rate tend to have a greater number of opioids prescription per resident. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/prescribing.html|title=Prescription Opioid Data|last=|first=|date=|website=CDC|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Several studies have been conducted to find out how opioids were primarily acquired, with varying findings. A 2013 national survey indicated that 74% of opioid abusers acquired their opioids directly from a single doctor, friend, or relative, who in turn received their opioids from a clinician.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; Though aggressive opioid prescription practices played the biggest role in creating the epidemic, the popularity of illegal substances such as potent heroin and illicit fentanyl have become an increasingly large factor. It has been suggested that decreased supply of prescription opioids caused by reforms turned people who were already addicted to opioids towards illegal substances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/opioid-crisis-what-people-dont-know-about-heroin-w520478 Opioid Crisis: What People Don't Know About Heroin], ''Rolling Stone''&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, approximately 50% of drug overdoses were not the result of an opioid product from a prescription, though most abusers' first exposure had still been by lawful prescription.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; By 2018, another study suggested that 75% of opioid abusers started their opioid use by taking drugs which had been obtained in a way other than by legitimate prescription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pergolizzi JV, LeQuang JA, Taylor R, Raffa RB | title = Going beyond prescription pain relievers to understand the opioid epidemic: the role of illicit fentanyl, new psychoactive substances, and street heroin | journal = Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 130 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29190175 | doi = 10.1080/00325481.2018.1407618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, Canada follows the United States as the second highest per capita user of prescription opioid. According the expert analysis, these prescription opioids leads to addictions which then results in the booming of street heroin and street fentanyl. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyer|first=Owen|date=2015-09-03|title=Canada’s prescription opioid epidemic grows despite tamperproof pills|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4725|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=351|pages=h4725|doi=10.1136/bmj.h4725|issn=1756-1833|pmid=26338104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Effects of the opioid epidemic are multifactorial. The high death rate by overdose, the spread of [[communicable disease]]s, and the economic burden are major issues caused by the epidemic.

The opioid epidemic has since emerged as one of the worst drug crises in American history: more than 33,000 people died from overdoses in 2015, nearly equal to the number of deaths from car crashes, with deaths from heroin alone more than from gun homicides.&lt;ref name=WAS&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/08/heroin-deaths-surpass-gun-homicides-for-the-first-time-cdc-data-show/ "Heroin deaths surpass gun homicides for the first time, CDC data shows"], ''Washington Post'', December 8, 2016, Retrieved May 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It has also left thousands of children suddenly in need of [[foster care]] after their parents have died from an overdose.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-children-of-the-opioid-crisis-1481816178 "The Children of the Opioid Crisis"], ''Wall Street Journal'', December 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alberta, a 2017 report stated that emergency department visits as a result of opiate overdose rose 1,000% in the five years prior.&lt;ref name="globalnews.ca"/&gt;

In 2016, a study estimated that the cost of prescription opioid overdoses, abuse and dependence in the United States in 2013 was approximately $78.5 billion, most of which was attributed to health care and criminal justice spending, along with lost productivity. However, in two years, statistics show significantly larger estimates because the epidemic has worsened with overdose and with deaths doubling in the past decade. The White House stated on November 20, 2017, that in 2015 alone the opioid epidemic cost the United States an estimated $504 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/20/the-true-cost-of-opioid-epidemic-tops-500-billion-white-house-says.html | title=The true cost of opioid epidemic tops $500 billion, White House says| date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Canada's national report stated that there were 3,987 opioid-related deaths, with 92% of these death being unintentional.

Prescription drug abusers have been increasing in teenagers with access to parents medicine cabinets, especially as 12- to 17-year-old abused girls were one-third of all new abusers of prescription drugs in 2006. Teens abuse prescription drugs more than any illicit drug except marijuana, more than cocaine, heroin, and [[methamphetamine]] combined, per the Office of National Drug Control Policy's 2008 report ''Prescription for Danger''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Deaths from overdose of heroin affect a younger demographic than deaths from other opiates.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt; The [[Canadian Institute for Health Information]] found that while overall a third of overdoses were intentional, among those ages 15–24 nearly half were intentional.&lt;ref name="globalnews.ca"/&gt;

Prescription rates for opioids vary widely across the states. In 2012, healthcare providers in the highest-prescribing state wrote almost three times as many opioid prescriptions per person as those in the lowest-prescribing state. Health issues that cause people pain do not vary much from place to place and do not explain this variability in prescribing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/prescribing.html | title=Prescription Opioid Data &amp;#124; Drug Overdose &amp;#124; CDC Injury Center| date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hawaii]], doctors wrote about 52 prescriptions for every 100 people, whereas in [[Alabama]], they wrote almost 143 prescriptions per 100 people. Researchers suspect that the variation results from a lack of consensus among elected officials in different states about how much pain medication to prescribe. A higher rate of prescription drug use does not lead to better health outcomes or patient satisfaction, according to studies.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/how-bad-is-the-opioid-epidemic/|title=How Bad is the Opioid Epidemic?|last=Nolan|first=Dan|last2=Amico|first2=Chris| name-list-format = vanc |date=February 23, 2016|website=Frontline|publisher=PBS|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It worked here. Why wouldn't it work elsewhere?" &lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt;

The majority of deaths worldwide from overdoses were from either medically prescribed opioids or illegal heroin. In Europe, prescription opioids accounted for three-quarters of overdose deaths among those between ages 15 and 39.&lt;ref name=Martins/&gt; Some worry that the epidemic could become a worldwide [[pandemic]] if not curtailed.&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt; Prescription drug abuse among teenagers in [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[Europe]] were at rates comparable to U.S. teenagers.&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2017/02/09/the-opioid-epidemic-could-turn-into-a-pandemic-if-were-not-careful/ "The opioid epidemic could turn into a pandemic if we're not careful"], ''Washington Post'', February 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lebanon]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], and in parts of [[China]], surveys found that one in ten students had used prescription painkillers for non-medical purposes. Similar high rates of non-medical use were found among the young throughout Europe, including [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt;

From January to August 2017, there were 60 fatal overdoses of fentanyl in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-40793887|title=Warnings after drug kills 'at least 60'|date=August 1, 2017|access-date=November 10, 2017|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The worry surrounding the potential of a worldwide [[pandemic]] has affected the disparity in opioid accessibility in countries around the world. Approximately 25.5 million people per year, including 2.5 million children, die without pain relief worldwide, with many of these cases occurring in low and middle-income countries. The current disparity in accessibility to pain relief in various countries is significant; the U.S. produces or imports 30 times as much pain relief medication as it needs while low-income countries such as [[Nigeria]] receive less than 0.2% of what they need, and 90% of all the morphine in the world is used by the world's richest 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knaul FM, Farmer PE, Krakauer EL, De Lima L, Bhadelia A, Jiang Kwete X, Arreola-Ornelas H, Gómez-Dantés O, Rodriguez NM, Alleyne GA, Connor SR, Hunter DJ, Lohman D, Radbruch L, Del Rocío Sáenz Madrigal M, Atun R, Foley KM, Frenk J, Jamison DT, Rajagopal MR | title = Alleviating the access abyss in palliative care and pain relief-an imperative of universal health coverage: the Lancet Commission report | language = English | journal = Lancet | volume = 391 | issue = 10128 | pages = 1391–1454 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29032993 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32513-8 | url = https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32513-8/fulltext }}&lt;/ref&gt; America's opioid epidemic has resulted in an “opiophobia” that is stirring conversations among some Western legislators and philanthropists about adopting a “[[war on drugs]] rhetoric” to oppose the idea of increasing opioid accessibility in other countries, in fear of starting similar opioid epidemics abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/health/opioids-africa-pain.html|title=‘Opiophobia’ Has Left Africa in Agony |first=Donald G. | last = McNeil | name-list-format = vanc |date=December 4, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 27, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB), a monitoring agency established by the U.N. to prevent addiction and ensure appropriate opioid availability for medical use, has written model laws limiting opioid accessibility that it encourages countries to enact.

==Countermeasures==
===U.S. federal government===
In 2010, the US government began cracking down on pharmacists and doctors who were over-prescribing opioid painkillers. An [[unintended consequence]] of this was that those addicted to prescription opiates turned to [[heroin]], a [[Equianalgesic#Opioid equivalency table|significantly more potent]] but cheaper opioid, as a substitute.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;&lt;ref name=Caldwell/&gt; A 2017 survey in [[Utah]] of heroin users found about 80 percent started with prescription drugs.&lt;ref name=Utah&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sltrib.com/news/5110951-155/poll-many-utahns-know-people-who | title = Poll: Many Utahns know people who seek treatment for opioid addiction, but barriers remain | work = The Salt Lake Tribune | date = April 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Controlled Substances Act]] was amended with the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act, which allows pharmacies to accept controlled substances from households or long-term care facilities in their drug disposal programs or "take-back" programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ273/pdf/PLAW-111publ273.pdf | title =Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 | date = October 12, 2010 | publisher = Government Publishing Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the federal government released a white paper describing the administration's plan to deal with the crisis. Its concerns have been echoed by numerous medical and government advisory groups around the world.&lt;ref name=cpso&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cpso.on.ca/CPSO/media/uploadedfiles/policies/policies/Opioid_report_final.pdf | title = Tackling the Opioid Public Health Crisis | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160607203830/http://www.cpso.on.ca/CPSO/media/uploadedfiles/policies/policies/Opioid_report_final.pdf | archive-date=June 7, 2016 | publisher = College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario | date = September 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccsa.ca/resource%20library/canada-strategy-prescription-drug-misuse-report-en.pdf "First Do No Harm: Responding to Canada's Prescription Drug Crisis"], Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delhidailynews.com/news/UK--Task-Force-offers-ideas-for-opioid-addiction-solutions-1402491160/ |title=UK: Task Force offers ideas for opioid addiction solutions |publisher=Delhidailynews.com |date=June 11, 2014 |access-date=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, President [[Barack Obama]] signed into law the [[Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act]], which expands opioid addiction treatment with [[buprenorphine]] and authorizes millions of dollars in funding for opioid research and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asam.org/advocacy/issues/opioids/summary-of-the-comprehensive-addiction-and-recovery-act Summary of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act], American Society of Addiction Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] announced their "Opioid Strategy" consisting of five aims:
#Improve access to prevention, treatment, and recovery support services to prevent the health, social, and economic consequences associated with opioid addiction and to enable individuals to achieve long-term recovery;
#Target the availability and distribution of overdose-reversing drugs to ensure the broad provision of these drugs to people likely to experience or respond to an overdose, with a particular focus on targeting high-risk populations;
#Strengthen public health data reporting and collection to improve the timeliness and specificity of data and to inform a real-time public health response as the epidemic evolves;
#Support cutting-edge research that advances our understanding of pain and addiction, leads to the development of new treatments, and identifies effective public health interventions to reduce opioid-related health harms; and
#Advance the practice of pain management to enable access to high-quality, evidence-based pain care that reduces the burden of pain for individuals, families, and society while also reducing the inappropriate use of opioids and opioid-related harms.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken another approach to this epidemic: requiring manufacturers of long-acting opioids to sponsor educational programs for prescribers. The FDA hoped that these educational programs would help deter off-label and over-prescribing; however, it is still unclear if these programs truly have a positive effect on reducing opioid prescriptions.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In July 2017, a 400-page report by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] presented plans to reduce the addiction crisis, which it said was killing 91 people each day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/major-science-report-lays-out-a-plan-to-tamp-down-opioid-crisis/ "Major Science Report Lays Out a Plan to Tamp Down Opioid Crisis"], ''Scientific American'', July 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

SAMHSA administers the Opioid State Targeted Response grants, a two-year program authorized by the [[21st Century Cures Act]] which provided $485 million to states and U.S. territories in the fiscal year 2017 for the purpose of preventing and combatting opioid misuse and addiction.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

&lt;!-- countermeasures --&gt;===State and local governments===
In response to the surging opioid prescription rates by health care providers that contributed to the opioid epidemic, U.S. states began passing legislation to stifle high-risk prescribing practices (such as prescribing high doses of opioids or prescribing opioids long-term). These new laws fell primarily into 1 of the following 4 categories:

# [[Prescription monitoring program|Prescription Drug Monitoring Program]] (PDMP) enrollment laws: prescribers must enroll in their state's PDMP, an electronic database containing a record of all patients' [[controlled substance]] prescriptions
# PDMP query laws: prescribers must check the PDMP before prescribing an opioid
# Opioid prescribing cap laws: opioid prescriptions cannot exceed designated doses or durations
# Pill mill laws: pain clinics are closely regulated and monitored to minimize the prescription of opioids non-medically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGinty EE, Stuart EA, Caleb Alexander G, Barry CL, Bicket MC, Rutkow L | title = Protocol: mixed-methods study to evaluate implementation, enforcement, and outcomes of U.S. state laws intended to curb high-risk opioid prescribing | journal = Implementation Science | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 37 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29482599 | pmc = 5828404 | doi = 10.1186/s13012-018-0719-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, governors from 45 U.S. states and three territories entered into a formal "Compact to Fight Opioid Addiction".

On January 17, 2018, several senators, including New Hampshire Senator [[Maggie Hassan]], wrote a letter to President Trump expressing extreme concern regarding his lack of commitment to the White House Office of Nation Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), which plays a critical role in coordinating the federal government's response to the fentanyl, heroin, and opioid epidemic. The letter states that the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy|ONDCP]] and [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] (Drug Enforcement Administration) have both been without permanent, Senate-confirmed leadership since Trump took office, and he has not presented the Senate with qualified candidates for these positions. The senators requested that Trump provide their offices with a list of his political appointees to key drug policy positions and those appointees' relevant qualifications, including appointees at ONDCP; the Department of Justice, including the DEA; the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA); and elsewhere in his administration.

[[Avalere Health]] has researched recent individual state efforts to combat the opioid crisis by providing access to life-saving drugs typically associated with opioid overdoses. Their research measured how states are performing in providing a key frontline treatment for opioid addiction ([[Buprenorphine]]), compared to the amount of opioid overdose deaths they have by state. Generally, the more access a state can provided drug users to the drug, the lower the mortality rate amongst opioid addicts were in a given state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lopez|first1=German| name-list-format = vanc |title=The states taking the opioid epidemic seriously (and not), in one map|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/22/17037346/opioid-epidemic-state-policy-map|publisher=Vox|access-date=February 24, 2018|date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 24.6 deaths per 1,000 people, [[Ohio]] has the 5th highest rate of drug overdose deaths in the United States. The Governor's Cabinet Opiate Action Team (GCOAT) was created in 2011 by [[John Kasich|Governor John Kasich]] and is "one of the nation's most aggressive and comprehensive approaches to address opioid use disorder and overdose deaths, including a strong focus on preventing the nonmedical use of prescription drugs". GCOAT utilizes partnerships with various state agencies including the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. The strategy suggests regulations that are encompassed under three main categories: (1) to promote the responsible use of opioids, (2) to reduce the supply of opioids, and (3) to support overdose prevention and expand access to naloxone. The legislation reduced the number of opioid doses by over 80 million between 2011 and 2015. Also, unintentional drug related overdose deaths involving prescription opioids have decreased from 45% in 2011 to 22% in 2015. However, Ohio has not seen a decrease in fentanyl distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Penm|first=Jonathan|date=|title=Strategies and policies to address the opioid epidemic: a case study of Ohio|url=https://www.japha.org/article/S1544-3191(17)30001-8/pdf|journal=Journal of the American Pharmacists Association|volume=57|pages=S148 - S153|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prescription drug monitoring===
In 2016, the CDC published its "Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain", recommending opioids only be used when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks, and then used at the lowest effective dosage, with avoidance of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use whenever possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dowell D, Haegerich TM, Chou R | title = CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain--United States, 2016 | journal = Jama | volume = 315 | issue = 15 | pages = 1624–45 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26977696 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.1464 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silvia Martins, an [[epidemiologist]] at Columbia University, has suggested getting out more information about the risks:{{quote|The greater "social acceptance" for using these medications (versus illegal substances) and the misconception that they are "safe" may be contributing factors to their misuse. Hence, a major target for intervention is the general public, including parents and youth, who must be better informed about the negative consequences of sharing with others medications prescribed for their own ailments. Equally important is the improved training of medical practitioners and their staff to better recognize patients at potential risk of developing nonmedical use, and to consider potential alternative treatments as well as closely monitor the medications they dispense to these patients.&lt;ref name=Martins/&gt;}}

The [[American Medical Association|American Medical Association (AMA)]] has created an Opioid Task Force that is committed to empowering physicians to combat the epidemic. The AMA has suggested 6 actions for physicians to take:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/reversing-opioid-epidemic|title=Reversing the Opioid Epidemic {{!}} AMA|website=www.ama-assn.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

# Register and use state prescription drug monitoring programs
# Enhance education and training
# Support comprehensive treatment for pain and substance use disorders
# Help end stigma
# Co-prescribe naloxone to patients at risk of overdose
# Encourage safe storage and disposal of opioids and all medications. 

The Opioid Task Force 2018 Progress Report states that, between 2013 and 2017, opioid prescriptions have decreased by 22.2% which includes a 9% decrease from 2016-2017 alone. The AMA Opioid Task Force also reports a 389% increase in physician participation in Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). Further, physicians are encouraged to co-prescribe naloxone to those at risk of overdose. In 2017 alone, weekly filled [[Naloxone]] prescriptions have doubled from 3,500 to 8,000. Finally, more than 50,000 physicians were certified in 2017 to provide in-office [[Buprenorphine]], a high quality, evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder. While the AMA celebrates the progress that has been made in combatting the crisis, they realize that 115 people still die every day in the United States from an opioid related overdose. Patrice A. Harris, MD, MA, Chair of the AMA Opioid Task Force, urges increased participation and collaboration, saying “what is needed now is a concerted&amp;nbsp;effort to greatly expand access to high quality care for pain and for substance use disorders. Unless and until we do that, this epidemic will not end.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/ama-report-shows-national-progress-toward-reversing-opioid-epidemic|title=AMA Report Shows National Progress Toward Reversing Opioid Epidemic {{!}} American Medical Association|website=www.ama-assn.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage has largely focused on law-enforcement solutions to the epidemic, which portray the issue as criminal, whereas some see it as a medical issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There has been differential reporting on how white suburban or rural addicts of opioids are portrayed compared to black and Hispanic urban addicts, often of heroin, reinforcing stereotypes of drug users and drug-using offenders.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Netherland J |title=The War on Drugs That Wasn't: Wasted Whiteness, "Dirty Doctors," and Race in Media Coverage of Prescription Opioid Misuse|url=|journal=[[Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry]]|volume=40|issue=4|pages=664–686|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In newspapers, white addicts' stories are often given more space, allowing for a longer backstory explaining how they became addicted, and what potential they had before using drugs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In early 2016 the national desk of the ''Washington Post'' began an investigation with assistance from fired DEA regulator Joseph Razzazzisi on the rapidly increasing numbers of opioid related deaths.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post''. Casey, Libby, host. (October 17, 2017). "Talk to reporters and source behind our story on the drug industry's triumph over the DEA" [https://www.periscope.tv/washingtonpost/1OdJrAEDANeGX# Periscopetv website] Retrieved November 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

While media coverage has focused more heavily on overdoses among whites, use among African, Hispanic and Native Americans has increased at similar rates. Deaths by overdose among white, black, and Native Americans increased by 200–300% from 2010–2014. During this time period, overdoses among Hispanics increased 140%, and the data available on overdoses by Asians was not comprehensive enough to draw a conclusion.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;

[[Social media]] may also be an outlet for detecting illegal online sales of opioids. In 2017, researchers tested a methodology that used keywords to aggregate [[Twitter|tweets]] and employed unsupervised machine learning and web forensic analyses to identify illegal online marketing of opioids. These efforts can aid criminal investigators in identifying violators of the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://clarkstonconsulting.com/insights/ai-wholesale-distribution-opioids/|title=Using AI in Wholesale Distribution to Mitigate Opioid Abuse |date=February 21, 2018|work=Clarkston Consulting|access-date=March 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
{{main|Drug abuse treatment}}
The opioid epidemic is often discussed in terms of prevention, but helping those who are already addicted is addressed less frequently.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGinty EE, Kennedy-Hendricks A, Baller J, Niederdeppe J, Gollust S, Barry CL | title = Criminal Activity or Treatable Health Condition? News Media Framing of Opioid Analgesic Abuse in the United States, 1998-2012 | journal = Psychiatric Services | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 405–11 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26620290 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ps.201500065 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Opioid dependence]] can lead to a number of consequences like contraction of [[HIV]] and [[overdose]]. For addicted persons who wish to treat their addiction, there are two classes of treatment options available: medical and behavioral.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Veilleux JC, Colvin PJ, Anderson J, York C, Heinz AJ | title = A review of opioid dependence treatment: pharmacological and psychosocial interventions to treat opioid addiction | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–66 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19926374 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither is guaranteed to successfully treat opioid addiction.&lt;!-- Citation required --&gt; Which treatment, or combination of treatments, is most effective varies from person to person.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{EMedicine|article|287790|Opioid Abuse|treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These treatments are doctor-prescribed and -regulated, but differ in their treatment mechanism. Popular treatments include [[kratom]], [[naloxone]], [[methadone]], and [[buprenorphine]], which are more effective when combined with a form of behavioral treatment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Accessing treatment, however, can be difficult. The strict regulation of opioid treatment programs (OTP) dates back to the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Before 1919, physicians prescribed milder forms of opiates to help ween patients off opium. In ''[[Webb v. United States]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that doctors could no longer prescribe narcotics to aid in treating a narcotic use disorder. Thus, morphine dispensaries emerged in communities to fill the treatment gap and were the early precedents to modern [[methadone]] clinics.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McCarty D, Priest KC, Korthuis PT|date=April 2018|title=Treatment and Prevention of Opioid Use Disorder: Challenges and Opportunities|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=39|issue=1|pages=525–541|doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040617-013526|pmc=5880741|pmid=29272165}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, nearly 100 years after the ''Webb v. United States'' ruling, it is still difficult for providers to prescribe opioids for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) despite the promising data that show individuals addicted to opioids have better outcomes with MAT than abstinence-based treatment programs.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; OTPs are required to be accredited by [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|SAMHSA]] or the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] to operate and accreditation is a lengthy, time- and resource-consuming process including intensive training and site visit reviews. To stay in operation, OTPs must submit to re-accreditation every 1-3 years.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/opioid-treatment-programs|title=Certification of OTPs|last=India.Young|date=2015-06-15|website=www.samhsa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Accredited OTPs are also able to administer buprenorphine, provided that those prescribing and administering the drug have completed the 8-24 hours of SAMHSA training.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/688047.pdf|title=Opioid Use Disorders: HHS Needs Measures to Assess the Effectiveness of Efforts to Expand Access to Medication-Assisted Treatment|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Government Accountability Office|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11-15-2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Office-based physicians who wish to prescribe buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder must also complete the required training, as well as apply for and receive a waiver from SAMHSA. Under regulation, physicians may not have more than 30 buprenorphine patients their first year of prescribing the drug. They may apply to have this limit increased to 100 patients by year two and 275 patients by year three.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

In December 2015, the [[Government Accountability Office|U.S. Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) began a survey of the laws and regulations around OTPs and MAT and found that these practices were barriers to getting people with opioid use disorders the treatment they need.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/680050.pdf|title=Opioid Addiction: Laws, Regulations, and Other Factors Can Affect Medication-Assisted Treatment Access |website=U.S. Government Accountability Office|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that there is a shortage of OTPs across the United States, many clinicians do not want to start their own because the time and effort required to comply with SAMHSA and DEA regulations is prohibitive.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vashishtha D, Mittal ML, Werb D | title = The North American opioid epidemic: current challenges and a call for treatment as prevention | language = En | journal = Harm Reduction Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 7 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28494762 | pmc = 5427522 | doi = 10.1186/s12954-017-0135-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Individual-level barriers to accessing MAT also exist. The federal regulations regarding program admission into OTPs are considered "high-threshold." Individuals seeking treatment must meet several criteria to be eligible for treatment. These criteria require potential patients to:

# Have a diagnosable opioid use disorder, according to the [[DSM-5]],
# Be actively addicted to opioids at the time of intake, and
# Have been addicted to opioids for at least one year before beginning MAT.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In addition to these federal criteria, each state may have its own criteria individuals must meet.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=64ccd98a6bf5f9bb1634f3fdb3a65653&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se42.1.8_112&amp;rgn=div8|title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations|website=www.ecfr.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The U.S. GAO also cited the cost of treatment and lack of health insurance coverage for MAT as barriers for many addicted to opioids. While methadone treatments are covered by Medicaid for low-income individuals, the extent of coverage depends on which state they are in and if the state has opted into Medicaid expansion under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; 

Buprenorphine, on the other hand, is not covered by Medicaid or, often, even by private health insurers.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Because buprenorphine must typically be paid for out-of-pocket, lower-income individuals are often priced out of the lower-risk MAT. In some areas this creates major disparities along racial lines with the higher-risk treatment utilized by lower-income individuals - disproportionately represented by people of color - and the lower-risk treatment only accessible to higher-income individuals - disproportionately represented by whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hansen HB, Siegel CE, Case BG, Bertollo DN, DiRocco D, Galanter M | title = Variation in use of buprenorphine and methadone treatment by racial, ethnic, and income characteristics of residential social areas in New York City | journal = The Journal of Behavioral Health Services &amp; Research | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–77 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23702611 | pmc = 3818282 | doi = 10.1007/s11414-013-9341-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other individual-level barriers may include transportation, especially for those who live in rural areas. The nearest OTP could be up to an hour away, and when daily methadone doses are required for treatment, this may interfere with the success of the MAT or the client's compliance in the program. In rural Vermont, 48% of respondents in treatment reported they had missed an appointment due to travel challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson Q, Mund B, Joudrey PJ | title = Improving Rural Access to Opioid Treatment Programs | journal = The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 437–439 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 30146991 | doi = 10.1177/1073110518782951 | url = https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F1073110518782951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of issues like these, it is estimated that, nationwide, only 10% of individuals who would be eligible to receive MAT actually receive the treatment.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The price of opioid treatment may vary due to different factors, but the cost of treatment can range from $6,000 to $15,000 a year.&lt;!-- Citation required --&gt; Based on the research, most addicts come from lagging economic environment which multiple addicts do not have the support or funding to complete alternative medication for the addictions.&lt;!-- Citation required --&gt;

====Methadone====
[[Methadone]] has been used for opioid dependence since 1964, and is the most-studied of the pharmacological treatment options.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turntohelp.com/starting-treatment/options|title=What are my treatment options? |date=June 11, 2017|website=TURN TO HELP|access-date=}}{{unreliable source?|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a synthetic long-acting opioid, so it can replace multiple heroin uses by being taken once daily.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It works by binding to the opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, activating them, reducing withdrawal symptoms and cravings while suppressing the "high" that other opioids can elicit. The decrease in withdrawal symptoms and cravings allow the user to slowly taper off the drug in a controlled manner, decreasing the likelihood of relapse. It is not accessible to all addicts. It is a regulated substance, and requires that each dose be picked up from a methadone clinic daily. This can be inconvenient as some patients are unable to travel to a clinic, or wish to avoid the stigma associated with drug addiction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Buprenorphine====
[[Buprenorphine]] is used similarly to methadone, with some doctors recommending it as the best solution for medication-assisted treatment to help people reduce or quit their use of heroin or other opiates. It is claimed to be safer and less regulated than methadone, with month-long prescriptions allowed. It is also said to eliminate opiate withdrawal symptoms and cravings in many patients without inducing euphoria.&lt;ref name=suboxone/&gt; [[Probuphine]] is an implantable form of buprenorphine lasting six months.&lt;ref name=NIAIDblog&gt;{{cite web| work = National Institute on Drug Abuse |title=New Medication Formulations Could Quickly Make a Difference for Treating Opioid Addiction|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2017/08/new-medication-formulations-could-quickly-make-difference-treating-opioid-addiction|date=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of buprenorphine use increased between 2003 and 2011, with sales increasing, on average, by 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Turner LW, Kruszewski SP, Mojtabai R, Webster D, Nesbit S, Stafford RS, Alexander GC |date=2015|title=Trends in Buprenorphine Utilization in the United States, 1997–2012 |journal=American Journal on Addictions|volume=24|pages=24–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike methadone treatment, which must be performed in a highly structured clinic, buprenorphine, according to [[SAMHSA]], can be prescribed or dispensed in physician offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment/buprenorphine|title=Buprenorphine|first= Lynne| last = Walsh | name-list-format = vanc |date=June 15, 2015|website=Samhsa.gov|access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients can thereby receive a full year of treatment for a fraction of the cost of detox programs.&lt;ref name=suboxone&gt;[http://www.pamplinmedia.com/pt/10-opinion/367132-248727-my-view-new-approach-needed-for-opioid-epidemic- "My View: New approach needed for opioid epidemic"], ''Portland Tribune'', July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buprenorphine/naloxone]] is a combination medication that has been approved by the FDA in 2002 for treatment of opioid dependence. It is a combination medication that contains two separate drugs: [[buprenorphine]] and [[naloxone]].&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://drugabuse.com/library/the-effects-of-suboxone-use/ |title=The Effects of Suboxone Use | website = drugabuse.com |access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buprenorphine works as a partial opioid agonist. It is given in combination with Naloxone because Naloxone works as an [[opioid antagonist]], meaning it will block the effects of the opioid medication. This combination drug can help by reducing a person’s withdrawal symptoms while they are discontinuing opioids after a period of chronic use.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

While Suboxone is indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence, it does contain an opioid which means a person may be at risk of developing dependence to it as well.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

====Behavioral treatment====
Behavioral treatment is less effective without medical treatment during the initial [[detoxification]]. It has similarly been shown that medical treatments tend to get better results when accompanied by behavioral treatment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For opioid dependence, popular non-pharmacological treatment options include [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), [[Group therapy|group]] or [[Individual therapy|individual]] therapy, [[residential treatment center]]s, and [[twelve-step program]]s such as [[Narcotics Anonymous]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since addictive behavior is a learned behavior in opioid dependence, cognitive behavioral therapy aims to promote positive motivation to change that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143185/|title=Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence|date=2009|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241547543|series=WHO Guidelines Approved by the Guidelines Review Committee|location=Geneva|pmid=23762965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;

===Harm reduction===
[[Harm reduction]] programs operate under the understanding that certain levels of drug use are inevitable and focus on minimizing adverse effects associated with drug use rather than stopping the behavior itself. In the context of the opioid epidemic, harm reduction strategies are designed to improve health outcomes and reduce overdose deaths.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

====Naloxone====
[[Naloxone]] (most commonly sold under the brand name Narcan) can be used as a rescue medication for opioid overdose or as a preventive measure for those wanting to stop using opiates. It is an [[opioid antagonist]], meaning it binds to [[opioid receptor]]s, which prevents them from being activated by opiates. It binds more strongly than other drugs, so that when someone is overdosing on opioids, naloxone can be administered, allowing it to take the place of the opioid drug in the person's receptors, turning them off. This blocks the effect of the receptors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Many states have made Narcan available for purchase without a prescription. Additionally, peace&lt;!-- Should this be "police"? --&gt; officers in many districts have begun carrying Narcan on a routine basis.&lt;!-- Needs citation  --&gt;

Take-home naloxone overdose prevention kits have shown promise in areas exhibiting rapid increases in opioid overdoses and deaths due to the increased availability of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Early implementation of programs that widely distribute THN kits across these areas can substantially reduce the number of opioid overdose deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Irvine MA, Buxton JA, Otterstatter M, Balshaw R, Gustafson R, Tyndall M, Kendall P, Kerr T, Gilbert M, Coombs D | title = Distribution of take-home opioid antagonist kits during a synthetic opioid epidemic in British Columbia, Canada: a modelling study | journal = The Lancet.

====Safe injection sites====
North America's first [[Supervised injection site|safe injection site]], [[Insite]], opened in the Downtown Eastside (DTES) neighborhood of [[Vancouver]] in 2003. Rather than trying to prevent people from using drugs, safe injection sites are intended to allow addicts to use drugs in an environment where help is immediately available in the event of an overdose. [[Health Canada]] has licensed 16 safe injection sites in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40828608|title=The city where addicts are allowed to inject|first=Robin|last=Levinson-King| name-list-format = vanc |date=August 7, 2017|access-date=November 10, 2017|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, about half of overdoses resulting in hospitalization were accidental, while a third were deliberate overdoses.&lt;ref name="globalnews.ca"/&gt;

Despite the illegality of injecting illicit drugs in most places around the world, many injectable drug users report willingness to utilize safe injection sites. Of these willing injectable drug users, those at especially high risk for opioid overdose were significantly more likely to be willing to use a safe injection site. This observed willingness suggests that safe injection sites would be well utilized by the very individuals who could benefit most from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = León C, Cardoso L, Mackin S, Bock B, Gaeta JM | title = The willingness of people who inject drugs in Boston to use a supervised injection facility | journal = Substance Abuse | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 95–101 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 28799847 | doi = 10.1080/08897077.2017.1365804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, legislation in the US did not allow for the opening of safe injection sites; there were no government-sponsored sites but several efforts were underway to try to create them.&lt;ref name=NPRsis&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/12/628136694/harm-reduction-movement-hits-obstacles|title=Cities Planning Supervised Drug Injection Sites Fear Justice Department Reaction|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics of safe injection sites cite enabling drug users and even exacerbation of drug use as reasons for denying these programs. However, data as of 2014 suggested that safe injection sites could reduce overdoses while not increasing the number of drug users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Potier C, Laprévote V, Dubois-Arber F, Cottencin O, Rolland B | title = Supervised injection services: what has been demonstrated? A systematic literature review | journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume = 145 | pages = 48–68 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25456324 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.10.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Needle exchange programs ====

The CDC defines [[needle exchange program]]s (NEP), also known as syringe services programs, as “community-based programs that provide access to sterile needles and syringes free of cost and facilitate safe disposal of used needles and syringes”.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/ssps.html|title=Syringe Services Programs {{!}} Injection Drug Use {{!}} HIV Risk and Prevention {{!}} HIV/AIDS {{!}} CDC|date=April 26, 2018|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEP were first established in the U.S. in the late 1980s as a response to the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV pandemic]]. Because federal funding has long been banned from being used for NEP, their prominence in the U.S. has been minimal.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clarke K, Harris D, Zweifler JA, Lasher M, Mortimer RB, Hughes S | title = The Significance of Harm Reduction as a Social and Health Care Intervention for Injecting Drug Users: An Exploratory Study of a Needle Exchange Program in Fresno, California | journal = Social Work in Public Health | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 398–407 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27167664 | pmc = 5129746 | doi = 10.1080/19371918.2015.1137522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in early 2016, in the face of the ever-increasing heroin crisis, Congress effectively rolled back those regulations and is now allowing federal funding to support certain aspects of NEP.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; NEP are cited by the CDC as a vital aspect of the multi-faceted approach to the opioid crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rudd RA, Seth P, David F, Scholl L | title = Increases in Drug and Opioid-Involved Overdose Deaths - United States, 2010-2015 | language = en-us | journal = MMWR.

While opposition to NEP includes fears of increased drug use, studies have shown that they do not increase drug use among users or within a community.&lt;ref name="pmid8715061"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loue S, Lurie P, Lloyd LS | title = Ethical issues raised by needle exchange programs | journal = The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 382–8 | date = 1995 | pmid = 8715061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NEP have also been known to increase admittance into addiction treatment centers, offer counseling, housing support and help users begin the path to recovery through outreach from trusted staff.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In addition, NEP that operate on a one-for-one basis help to drastically reduce the amount of discarded needles in public. Both the Center for Disease Control and National Institute of Health support the idea that NEP are a crucial aspect to a comprehensive approach to the opioid crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/understanding-drug-use-addiction |title=Understanding Drug Use and Addiction| work =National Institute on Drug Abuse |access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;

====Use of blue lights====
As of 2018, some retailers had begun experimenting with the use of blue light bulbs in bathrooms in order to deter addicts from using such spaces to inject opiates.&lt;ref name=bluelights&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624161139/https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/retailers-experiment-blue-lights-deter-drug-56119839|title=Retailers experiment with blue lights to deter drug use|publisher=ABC News|first1=Michael|last1=Rubinkam| name-list-format = vanc |date=June 24, 2018|access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue lights are said to make finding veins to inject more difficult.&lt;ref name=bluelights/&gt;

Opiates such as morphine have been used for pain relief in the United States since the 1800s, and were used during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Hicks"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hicks |first1=Robert D. | name-list-format = vanc   |title=Frontline Pharmacies  |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/frontline-pharmacies |journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine |publisher= [[Chemical Heritage Foundation]] |date=2011|volume= |issue= |pages= |access-date=October 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rinde |first1=Meir | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Opioids' Devastating Return  |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/opioids-devastating-return |journal=Distillations |date=2018|volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=12–23 |access-date=August 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opiates soon became known as a wonder drug and were prescribed for a wide array of ailments, even for relatively minor treatments such as cough relief.&lt;ref name="thehill.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/healthcare/293473-the-devastating-effect-of-opioids-on-our-society | title=The devastating effect of opioids on our society| date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bayer]] began marketing heroin commercially in 1898.

In the 1950s, heroin addiction was known among jazz musicians, but still fairly uncommon among average Americans, many of whom saw it as a frightening condition.&lt;ref name=Caldwell/&gt; The fear extended into the 1960s and 1970s, although it became common to hear or read about drugs such as [[marijuana]] and [[psychedelics]], which were widely used at rock concerts like [[Woodstock]].&lt;ref name=Caldwell/&gt; Heroin addiction began to make the news around 1970 when rock star [[Janis Joplin]] died from an overdose. During and after the [[Vietnam War]], addicted soldiers returned from Vietnam, where heroin was easily bought. Heroin addiction grew within low-income housing projects during the same time period.&lt;ref name=Caldwell/&gt; In 1971, congressmen released an explosive report on the growing heroin epidemic among U.S. servicemen in [[Vietnam]], finding that ten to fifteen percent were addicted to heroin. "The [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] [[White House]] panicked," wrote political editor [[Christopher Caldwell (journalist)|Christopher Caldwell]], and declared [[Substance abuse|drug abuse]] "public enemy number one".&lt;ref name="dupont"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/dupont.html WGBH educational foundation.

Modern prescription opiates such as [[Vicodin]] and [[Percocet]] entered the market in the 1970s, but acceptance took several years and doctors were apprehensive about prescribing them.&lt;ref name="thehill.com"/&gt; Until the 1980s, physicians had been taught to avoid prescribing opioids because of their addictive nature.&lt;ref name="Moghe"/&gt; A brief letter published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' (NEJM) in January 1980, titled "[[Addiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics]]", generated much attention and changed this thinking.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NEJM-1980&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porter J, Jick H | title = Addiction rare in patients treated with narcotics | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 302 | issue = 2 | pages = 123 | date = January 1980 | pmid = 7350425 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198001103020221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of researchers in Canada claim that the letter may have originated and contributed to the opioid crisis.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-40136881 |title=Opioid crisis: The letter that started it all |publisher=BBC |newspaper=BBC News |date=June 3, 2017 |access-date=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine|NEJM]]'' published its rebuttal to the 1980 letter in June 2017, pointing out among other things that the conclusions were based on hospitalized patients only, and not on patients taking the drugs after they were sent home.&lt;ref name=NEJM-2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leung PT, Macdonald EM, Stanbrook MB, Dhalla IA, Juurlink DN | title = A 1980 Letter on the Risk of Opioid Addiction | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 376 | issue = 22 | pages = 2194–2195 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28564561 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMc1700150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original author, Dr. [[Hershel Jick]], has said that he never intended for the article to justify widespread opioid use.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

In the mid-to-late 1980s, the [[crack epidemic]] followed widespread [[cocaine]] use in American cities. The [[Mortality rate|death rate]] was worse, reaching almost 2 per 100,000. In 1982, Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] and his aides began pushing for the involvement of the [[CIA]] and the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] in drug interdiction efforts, the so-called [[War on Drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Peter Dale; Marshall, Jonathan. ''Cocaine Politics: Drugs, Armies, and the CIA in Central America'', Berkeley, CA: University of California Press (1991) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The initial promotion and marketing of OxyContin was an organized effort throughout 1996–2001, to dismiss the risk of opioid addiction. [[Purdue Pharma]] hosted over forty promotional conferences at three select locations in the southwest and southeast of the United States. Coupling a convincing "Partners Against Pain" campaign with an incentivized bonus system, Purdue trained its salesforce to convey the message that the risk of addiction was under one percent, ultimately influencing the prescribing habits of the medical professionals that attended these conferences.&lt;ref name="Van Zee 2009"/&gt; In 2016, the opioid epidemic was killing on average 10.3 people per 100,000, with the highest rates including over 30 per 100,000 in [[New Hampshire]] and over 40 per 100,000 in [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Caldwell/&gt;

According to the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]]'s National Survey on Drug Use and Health, in 2016 more than 11 million Americans misused prescription opioids, nearly 1 million used [[heroin]], and 2.1 million had an addiction to prescription opioids or heroin.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2017/federal-efforts-to-combat-opioid-crisis-status-update-cara-other-initiatives|title=Federal Efforts to Combat the Opioid Crisis: A Status Update on CARA and Other Initiatives|work =National Institute on Drug Abuse |date=October 25, 2017 |access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While rates of overdose of legal prescription opiates has leveled off in the past decade, overdoses of illicit opiates have surged since 2010, nearly tripling.&lt;ref name="Dowell 2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dowell D, Noonan RK, Houry D | title = Underlying Factors in Drug Overdose Deaths | journal = Jama | volume = 318 | issue = 23 | pages = 2295–2296 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29049472 | pmc = 6007807 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2017.15971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, around 72,000 Americans died from drug overdose. 29,406  were due to synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, 15,958 were associated with heroin overuse, 14,958 deaths were associated with natural and semi-synthetic opioids overuse, 10,721 deaths were associated with cocaine overuse, 10,721 deaths were associated with methamphetamine overuse, and 3,295 deaths were associated with methadone overuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overdose Death Rates |url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates |website=National Institute of Drug Abuse |publisher=NIH |accessdate=11/2/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heroin===
Between 4–6% of people who misuse prescription opioids turn to [[heroin]], and 80% of heroin addicts began by abusing prescription opioids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis|title=Opioid Overdose Crisis|work = National Institute on Drug Abuse |date=June 1, 2017 |access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people addicted to opioids switch from taking prescription opioids to heroin because heroin is less expensive and more easily acquired on the black market.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kolodny A, Courtwright DT, Hwang CS, Kreiner P, Eadie JL, Clark TW, Alexander GC | title = The prescription opioid and heroin crisis: a public health approach to an epidemic of addiction | journal = Annual Review of Public Health | volume = 36 | issue =  | pages = 559–74 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25581144 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031914-122957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men are more likely to overdose on heroin. Overall, opioids are among the biggest killers of every race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/upshot/overshadowed-by-the-opioid-crisis-a-comeback-by-cocaine.html|title=Overshadowed by the Opioid Crisis: A Comeback by Cocaine|date=2018-03-05|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=|last1=Frakt|first1=Austin| name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heroin use has been increasing over the years. An estimated 374,000 Americans used heroin in 2002–2005, and this estimate grew to nearly double where 607,000 of Americans had used heroin in 2009–2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/illicit/heroin.html|title=Heroin: Effects, Addictions &amp; Treatment Options|last=Anderson|first=Leigh| name-list-format = vanc |date=May 18, 2014|website=Drugs.com|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was estimated that more than half a million Americans had an addiction to heroin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2016/what-science-tells-us-about-opioid-abuse-addiction#references|title=What Science tells us About Opioid Abuse and Addiction| work = National Institute on Drug Abuse |date=January 27, 2016 |access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxycodone===
[[Oxycodone]] is the most widely used [[Recreational drug use|recreational opioid]] in the United States. The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] estimates that about 11 million people in the U.S. consume oxycodone in a non-medical way annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Now-a-counselor-she-went-from-stoned-to-straight-6605620.php Now a counselor, she went from stoned to straight], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', November 2. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxycodone was first made available in the United States in 1939. In the 1970s, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] classified oxycodone as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II controlled substances|Schedule II]] drug, indicating a high potential for abuse and addiction. In 1996, [[Purdue Pharma]] introduced OxyContin, a [[controlled release]] [[Pharmaceutical formulation|formulation]] of oxycodone.&lt;ref name="Van Zee 2009"/&gt; The FDA approved relabeling the reformulated version as abuse-resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.nascsa.org/Conference2012/Presentations/Coplan.pdf |conference-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512052124/http://www.nascsa.org/conference2012.htm |last=Coplan |first=Paul| name-list-format = vanc  |title=Findings from Purdue's Post-Marketing Epidemiology Studies of Reformulated OxyContin's Effects |conference=NASCSA 2012 Conference |year=2012 |location=Scottsdale, Arizona |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614115419/http://www.nascsa.org/Conference2012/Presentations/Coplan.pdf |archive-date=June 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, drug users quickly learned how to simply crush the controlled release tablet to swallow, inhale, or inject the high-strength opioid for a powerful morphine-like [[Euphoria|high]]. In fact, Purdue's private testing conducted in 1995 determined that 68% of the oxycodone could be extracted from an OxyContin tablet when crushed.&lt;ref name="Van Zee 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Zee A | title = The promotion and marketing of oxycontin: commercial triumph, public health tragedy | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 99 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–7 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 18799767 | pmc = 2622774 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2007.131714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Purdue paid $600 million in fines after being prosecuted for making false claims about the risk of drug abuse associated with oxycodone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Meier|first=Barry | name-list-format = vanc |date=May 10, 2007|title=In Guilty Plea, OxyContin Maker to Pay $600 Million|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/business/11drug-web.html|work=[[New York Times]]|location= |access-date=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Purdue Pharma reformulated OxyContin, using a [[polymer]] to make the pills extremely difficult to crush or dissolve in water to reduce OxyContin abuse. OxyContin use following the 2010 reformulation declined slightly while no changes were observed in the use of other opioids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hwang CS, Chang HY, Alexander GC | title = Impact of abuse-deterrent OxyContin on prescription opioid utilization | journal = Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 197–204 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25393216 | doi = 10.1002/pds.3723 | authorlink2 = Howard Y. Chang }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OxyContin was removed from the Canadian [[Formulary (pharmacy)|drug formulary]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morin KA, Eibl JK, Franklyn AM, Marsh DC | title = The opioid crisis: past, present and future policy climate in Ontario, Canada | journal = Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 45 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29096653 | pmc = 5667516 | doi = 10.1186/s13011-017-0130-5 }}g&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, the FDA asked the manufacturer to remove its injectable form of [[oxymorphone]] (Opana ER) from the US market, because the drug's benefits may no longer outweigh its risks, this being the first time the agency has asked to remove a currently marketed opioid pain medication from sale due to [[public health]] consequences of abuse.&lt;ref name=fda&gt;{{cite web| author = Office of the Commissioner|access-date=June 15, 2017 |title= Press Announcements – FDA requests removal of Opana ER for risks related to abuse |url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm562401.htm |website=Fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydrocodone ===
Hydrocodone is second among the list of top prescribed opioid painkillers, but it is also high on the list of most abused. In 2011, the abuse or misuse of hydrocodone was responsible for more than 97,000 visits to the emergency room. In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rescheduled it from a Schedule III drug to a Schedule II drug, recognizing its high potential for abuse and addiction.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cardia L, Calapai G, Quattrone D, Mondello C, Arcoraci V, Calapai F, Mannucci C, Mondello E | title = Preclinical and Clinical Pharmacology of Hydrocodone for Chronic Pain: A Mini Review | journal = Frontiers in Pharmacology | volume = 9 | pages = 1122 | date = 2018-10-01 | pmid = 30327606 | pmc = 6174210 | doi = 10.3389/fphar.2018.01122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrocodone can be prescribed under a different brand name. These brand names include Norco, Lortab, and Vicodin.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drugabuse.com/library/the-effects-of-hydrocodone-use/|title=The Effects of Hydrocodone Use - DrugAbuse.com|website=drugabuse.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrocodone can also exist in other formulations where it is combined with another non-opioid pain reliever such as acetaminophen, or even a cough suppressant.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

When opioids like hydrocodone are taken as prescribed, for the indication prescribed, and for a short period of time, then the risk of abuse and addiction is small. Problems have surfaced over the last decade however, due to its wide overuse and misuse in the setting of chronic pain.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The elderly are at an increased risk for opioid related overdose because several different classes of medications can interact with opioids and older patients are often taking multiple prescribed medications at a single time. One class of drug that is commonly prescribed in this patient population is benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines by themselves put older people at risk for falls and fractures due to associated side effects related to dizziness and sedation. Opioids by themselves put older people at risk of respiratory depression and impaired ability to operate vehicles and other machinery. Combining these two drugs together not only increases a person's risk of the aforementioned adverse effects, but it can increase a person's risk of overdose and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/health/elderly-drugs-addiction.html|title=A Quiet Drug Problem Among the Elderly|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics show that hydrocodone ranks in at number 4 on the list of most commonly abused drugs in the United States and that more than 40% of drug related emergencies occur due to opioid abuse. Twenty percent of opioid abusers, another statistic reports, were prescribed the medication they abused. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.addictioncenter.com/opiates/hydrocodone/|title=Hydrocodone Addiction and Abuse - Prescription Painkillers|work=AddictionCenter|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrocodone was declared the most widely prescribed opioid between 2007 and 2016, and in 2015 the International Narcotics Control Board reported that greater than 98% of the hydrocodone consumed in the entire world was consumed by Americans. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/18/health/opioid-crisis-fast-facts/index.html|title=Opioid Crisis Fast Facts|last=Library|first=CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''Codeine''' ===
Codeine is a prescription opiate used to treat mild to moderate pain. It is available as a tablet and cough syrup. Approximately 33 million people use codeine each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.addictioncenter.com/opiates/codeine/|title=Codeine Addiction and Abuse|work=AddictionCenter|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study on the concoction of codeine with alcohol or soda, also known as “purple drank,” discovered that codeine is most prevalently abused by men, Native Americans and Hispanics, urban students, and LGBT persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-01|title=Purple drank prevalence and characteristics of misusers of codeine cough syrup mixtures|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460313000920|journal=Addictive Behaviors|language=en|volume=38|issue=9|pages=2445–2449|doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2013.03.020|issn=0306-4603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolescent use of prescription codeine for recreational abuse raises concerns. In 2008, the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMSHA) reported 3 million young adults, ranging from ages 12 to 25, had used codeine-based cough syrup to get high.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://americanaddictioncenters.org/codeine-addiction/cough-syrup|title=Cough Syrup with Codeine Abuse, Also Known as Lean and Purple Drank|work=American Addiction Centers|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, 467,000 American adolescents used these opiates for non-medical purposes, and 168,000 of these were considered to have an addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://americanaddictioncenters.org/codeine-addiction|title=Codeine Addiction: Signs, Overdose, &amp; Withdrawal|work=American Addiction Centers|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its high rates of abuse, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) reclassified codeine as Schedule III for increased meticulous monitoring.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

"Exposure via inhalation or skin absorption can be deadly," they state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/fentanyl/risk.html|title=CDC – Fentanyl: Workers at Risk – NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topics|date=August 30, 2017|website=Cdc.gov|access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a two-year period, close to $800 million worth of fentanyl pills were illegally sold online to the U.S. by Chinese distributors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/us/politics/senate-investigation-china-mail-opioids.html "Online Sales of Illegal Opioids from China Surge in U.S."], ''New York Times'', January 24, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/opioids/americans-spent-nearly-800m-in-2-years-on-illegal-fentanyl-from-china-5-things-to-know.html "Americans spent nearly $800M in 2 years on illegal fentanyl from China: 5 things to know"], ''Becker's Hospital Review'', January 25, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The drug is usually manufactured in China, then shipped to Mexico where it is processed and packaged, which is then smuggled into the U.S. by drug cartels. A large amount is also purchased online and shipped through the U.S. Postal Service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/population-health/deadly-synthetic-opioids-coming-to-us-via-dark-web-and-the-postal-service.html "Deadly synthetic opioids coming to US via 'dark web' and the postal service"], ''Becker's Hospital Review'', December 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be purchased directly from China, which has become a major manufacturer of various synthetic drugs illegal in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/world/asia/in-china-illegal-drugs-are-sold-online-in-an-unbridled-market.html "In China, Illegal Drugs Are Sold Online in an Unbridled Market"], ''New York Times'', June 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Associated Press|AP]] reporters found multiple sellers in China willing to ship carfentanyl, an elephant tranquilizer that is so potent it has been considered a [[chemical weapon]].

Deaths from fentanyl increased by 540 percent across the United States since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/02/upshot/fentanyl-drug-overdose-deaths.html|title=The First Count of Fentanyl Deaths in 2016: Up 540% in Three Years|last=Katz|first=Josh| name-list-format = vanc |date=September 2, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 29, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accounts for almost "all the increase in drug overdose deaths from 2015 to 2016", according to a study published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''.&lt;ref name="Dowell 2017"/&gt;

Fentanyl-laced heroin has become a big problem for major cities, including [[Philadelphia]], [[Detroit]] and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clickorlando.com/news/orlando-man-pleads-guilty-to-selling-heroin-mixed-with-fentanyl "Orlando man pleads guilty to selling heroin mixed with fentanyl"], Orlando.com, March 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Its use has caused a spike in deaths among users of heroin and prescription painkillers, while becoming easier to obtain and conceal. Some arrested or hospitalized users are surprised to find that what they thought was heroin was actually fentanyl.&lt;ref name=Caldwell/&gt; According to CDC director [[Thomas Frieden]]:
{{quote|As overdose deaths involving heroin more than quadrupled since 2010, what was a slow stream of illicit fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine, is now a flood, with the amount of the powerful drug seized by law enforcement increasing dramatically. America is awash in opioids; urgent action is critical.&lt;ref name=CDC-Fox/&gt;}}

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), death rates from synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, increased over 72% from 2014 to 2015.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; In addition, the CDC reports that the total deaths from opioid overdoses may be under-counted, since they do not include deaths that are associated with synthetic opioids which are used as pain relievers. The CDC presumes that a large proportion of the increase in deaths is due to illegally-made fentanyl; as the statistics on overdose deaths (as of 2015) do not distinguish pharmaceutical fentanyl from illegally-made fentanyl, the actual death rate could, therefore, be much higher than reported.&lt;ref name=CDC1&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/analysis.html "Opioid Data Analysis"], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), date?&lt;/ref&gt;

Those taking fentanyl-laced heroin are more likely to overdose because they do not know they also are ingesting the more powerful drug. The most high-profile death involving an accidental overdose of fentanyl was singer [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].&lt;ref name=Prince&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/princes-death-highlights-dangers-opioid-painkiller-fentanyl/story?id=38935664 "Prince's Autopsy Result Highlights Dangers of Opioid Painkiller Fentanyl"], ABC News, June 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/documents-highlight-princes-struggle-with-opioid-addiction/ "Documents highlight Prince’s struggle with opioid addiction"], ''Seattle Times'', April 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/news/20170316/coroner-franklin-county-fentanyl-deaths-hit-unprecedented-rate-of-one-per-day "Coroner: Franklin County fentanyl deaths hit 'unprecedented' rate of one per day"], ''The Columbus Dispatch'', March 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Fentanyl has surpassed heroin as a killer in several locales: in all of 2014 the CDC identified 998 fatal fentanyl overdoses in [[Ohio]], which is the same number of deaths recorded in just the first five months of 2015. The U.S. Attorney for the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio|Northern District of Ohio]] stated:{{quote|One of the truly terrifying things is the pills are pressed and dyed to look like oxycodone. If you are using oxycodone and take fentanyl not knowing it is fentanyl, that is an overdose waiting to happen. Each of those pills is a potential overdose death.&lt;ref name=STAT/&gt;}}

In 2016, the medical news site ''[[Stat (website)|STAT]]'' reported that while Mexican cartels are the main source of heroin smuggled into the U.S., Chinese suppliers provide both raw fentanyl and the machinery necessary for its production.&lt;ref name=STAT&gt;[https://www.statnews.com/2016/04/05/fentanyl-traced-to-china/ "'Truly terrifying': Chinese suppliers flood US and Canada with deadly fentanyl"], ''STAT'', April 5, 2016,&lt;/ref&gt; In [[British Columbia]], police discovered a lab making 100,000 fentanyl pills each month, which they were shipping to [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. 90 people in Calgary overdosed on the drug in 2015.&lt;ref name=STAT/&gt; In [[Southern California]], a home-operated drug lab with six pill presses was uncovered by federal agents; each machine was capable of producing thousands of pills an hour.&lt;ref name=STAT/&gt;

Overdoses involving fentanyl have greatly contributed to the havoc caused by the opioid epidemic. In [[New Hampshire]], two thirds of the fatal drug overdoses involved fentanyl, and most do not know that they are taking fentanyl. In 2017, a cluster of fentanyl overdoses in [[Florida]] was found to be caused by street sales of fentanyl pills sold as [[Xanax]]. According to the DEA, one kg of fentanyl can be bought in [[China]] for $3,000 to $5,000, and then smuggled into the United States by mail or Mexican drug cartels to generate over $1.5 million in revenue. The profitability of this drug has led dealers to adulterate other drugs with fentanyl without the knowledge of the drug user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Addressing America's Fentanyl Crisis|publisher=National Institute of Drug Abuse|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2017/04/addressing-americas-fentanyl-crisis|date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pill mills ===
A "[[pill mill]]" is a clinic that dispenses narcotics to patients without a legitimate medical purpose. This is done at clinics and doctors offices, where doctors  examine patients extremely quickly with a purpose of prescribing painkillers. These clinics often charge an office fee of $200 to $400  and can see up to 60 patients a day, which is very profitable for the clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docjt.ky.gov/Magazines/Issue%2041/files/assets/downloads/page0019.pdf|title=Signs of a Pill Mill in Your Community |publisher=Kentucky Law Enforcement|website=Kentucky Government|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pill mills are also large suppliers of the illegal painkiller [[black market]]s on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://samquinones.com/reporters-blog/2016/10/03/dr-procters-house/|title=Dr. Procter's House -|date=October 3, 2016|access-date=November 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dealers may hire people to go to pill mills to get painkiller prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dreamland|last=Quinones|first=Sam| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been attempts to shut down pill mills, and 250 pill mills in Florida were shut down in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://drugabuse.com/featured/americas-pill-mills/|title=America's Pill Mills|date=July 1, 2016|work=DrugAbuse.com|access-date=November 26, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida clinics also are no longer allowed to dispense painkillers directly from their clinics, which has helped reduce the distribution of prescription opiates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/health-news/pill-mill-doctors-prosecuted-amid-opioid-epidemic#6|title=Cracking Down on 'Pill Mill' Doctors|website=www.healthline.com|language=en|access-date=November 26, 2017|date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the implementation of pill mill laws and drug monitoring programs in Florida, high-risk patients (defined as those who use both [[benzodiazepine]]s and opioids, those who have been using high opioid doses for extended periods of time, or "opioid shoppers" that obtain their opioid painkillers from multiple sources) have shown significant reductions in opioid use.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang HY, Murimi I, Faul M, Rutkow L, Alexander GC | title = Impact of Florida's prescription drug monitoring program and pill mill law on high-risk patients: A comparative interrupted time series analysis | journal = Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 422–429 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29488663 | doi = 10.1002/pds.4404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trafficking ===
As the number of opioid prescriptions rose, drug cartels began flooding the U.S. with heroin from [[Mexico]]. For many opioid users, heroin was cheaper, more potent, and often easier to acquire than prescription medications.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt; According to the CDC, tighter prescription policies by doctors did not necessarily lead to this increased heroin use.&lt;ref name=Prescriptions/&gt; The main suppliers of heroin to the U.S. have been Mexican [[Transnational crime|transnational criminal organizations]].&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt; From 2005–2009, Mexican heroin production increased by over 600%, from an estimated 8 metric tons in 2005 to 50 metric tons in 2009.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt; Between 2010 and 2014, the amount seized at the border more than doubled.&lt;ref name=FAS&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IN10456.pdf "Heroin Production in Mexico and U.S. Policy"], Congressional Research Service report, March 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[DEA]], smugglers and distributors "profit primarily by putting drugs on the street and have become crucial to the Mexican cartels."&lt;ref name=DEA&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dea.gov/docs/2015%20NDTA%20Report.pdf | title = 2015 National Drug Threat Assessment Summary | archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20170220010849/https://www.dea.gov/docs/2015%20NDTA%20Report.pdf |archive-date=February 20, 2017 | publisher = DEA | date = October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

'''Phunoi''' ([[Sinsali language|Sinsali]]) is a [[Loloish language]] (or languages) of northern [[Laos]]. Dialects are divergent and may be distinct languages; these are Black Khoany, White Khoany, Mung, Hwethom, Khaskhong. Bradley cites six languages within Phunoi.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, David (2007). "East and Southeast Asia". In Christopher Moseley, ed. ''Encyclopedia of the World's Endangered Languages''. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Phongsaly Province]], Phunoi is spoken in [[Phongsaly District|Phongxaly District]] and [[Boun Tay District|Bun Tay District]] (including in Langne Village) (Kingsada 1999).

==Migration history==
Migration from Russia to Belgium grew in line with increasing commercial relations between the two countries in the late 19th century. By 1910, there were already roughly 7,500 Russians in the country, including many students in universities at Brussels, [[Ghent]], and [[Liège]].&lt;ref name="Stols 2002 43"/&gt; The post-[[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] community of Russians in [[Belgium]] comprised mostly Russian military personnel. Former Tsarist officers maintained numerous relations with Belgian anti-communist organisations.&lt;ref name="Coudenys 2002 480"&gt;{{harvnb|Coudenys|2002|p=480}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1937, there were already about 8,000 Russians in the country, largely concentrated in [[Brussels]] and the Francophone portions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coudenys|2002|p=479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium was the only country whose [[White émigré|Russian émigré]] population increased during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Coudenys 2002 480"/&gt;

==Numbers==
{{asof|2008}}, official statistics showed 7,176 Russian citizens in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Population par nationalité, sexe, groupe et classe d'âges|date=January 2008|url=http://statbel.fgov.be/fr/binaries/31117115t_fr_tcm326-56012.xls|publisher=[[Statistics Belgium]]|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 3,407 Russian citizens obtained [[Belgian nationality law|Belgian nationality]] between 1992 and 2007.&lt;ref name="Naturalization"&gt;{{citation|title=Etrangers ayant obtenu la nationalité belge selon la nationalité précédente, 1990-2007|date=December 2009|url=http://russian-belgium.be/img/Query_TE_SDS_RRN_PSN_NATLTY.xls|publisher=[[Statistics Belgium]]|accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, 10,244 persons coming from [[post-Soviet states|countries of the former USSR]] obtained Belgian citizenship between 1990 and 2007.&lt;ref name="Naturalization"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1400">'''Ryan Alan Hade''' (''[[circa|c.]]'' 1982 &amp;ndash; June 9, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[sexual assault]] victim from [[Tacoma, Washington]].  On May 20, 1989, he was [[rape]]d, [[mutilation|mutilated]], stabbed and left for dead in a vacant lot that was later turned into a Tacoma park named Ryan's Park. [[Earl Kenneth Shriner]] was convicted of the attack and sentenced to 131 years in [[prison]].  Shriner had a long history of sexual assault charges spanning 25 years. The case has been cited as one of the catalysts for new US laws allowing [[civil commitment|indefinite confinement]] of [[sex offender]]s. Hade, who survived the attack by Shriner, died in a vehicular accident.

Until about the 18th century the Storyani were entirely a pastoral and trading tribe;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; they were venturesome traders, carrying goods from [[Kandahar]] as far as [[West  Bengal]], but the feud with their neighbors the [[Musakhel Bazar|Musa Khel]] and the [[Bozdar]] put a stop to their annual westward immigration, and they were forced to take to agriculture and subsequently acquired a good deal of the country below the hills.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Their territory includes the eastern slopes of the [[Suleiman Mountains]], the crest of the range being held by the Musa Khel, and Zmaryani.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/frontieroverseas03indi/frontieroverseas03indi_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Frontier and overseas expeditions from India"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swiss-German Sign Language''' (German: ''Deutschschweizer Gebärdensprache'', abbreviated '''DSGS''') is the primary [[deaf sign language]] of the [[German-speaking Switzerland|German-speaking part of Switzerland]] and of [[Liechtenstein]]. The language was established around 1828.&lt;ref name=Wittmann/&gt; In 2011 it was estimated that 7,500 deaf and 13,000 hearing people use DSGS.&lt;ref name="HfH" /&gt; There are six dialects which developed in boarding schools for the deaf, in Zurich, Bernese, Basel, Lucerne, and St. Gallen, as well as in Liechtenstein.&lt;ref name="HfH" /&gt;

== Name ==
In Switzerland, the language is called ''Gebärdensprache'' (''sign language'') if a distinction from other languages is not required. Some sources call it ''Natürliche Gebärden'' or ''Natürliche Gebärdensprache'',&lt;ref name=e18&gt;{{e18|sgg}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Swiss Sign Language''' (''Langage gestuel suisse'').&lt;ref name=Wittmann/&gt; The former just means 'natural sign', like those for "sleep" or "eat", in contrast to ''Abstrakte Gebärden'' 'conceptual sign',&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Hörbehinderten Selbsthilfe e.v.: [http://www.hoerbehindertenselbsthilfe.de/index.php/hoerenundverstehen/gebaerdensprache Gebärdensprache]&lt;/ref&gt; and so the term is no longer used. Most English sources today uses the term ''German-Swiss Sign Language'' or ''Swiss-German Sign Language''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]: [http://www.iana.org/assignments/lang-tags/sgn-CH-de Language tag assignment for German Swiss Sign Language]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Center for sign language research: [http://www.fzgresearch.org/bibliography.html Bibliography]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Wittmann (1991) suspects that Swiss-German Sign Language may be part of the [[French Sign Language family]], but it is not close and this is not easy to demonstrate.&lt;ref name=Wittmann&gt;[[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann, Henri]] (1991).  "Classification linguistique des langues signées non vocalement." Revue québécoise de linguistique théorique et appliquée 10:1.215–88.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1991a-class.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Switzerland, the parentage of this language is still in research. Research on whether DSGS could be a derivative of the [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) is planned, but it was observed that DSGS signers are often more open to borrowing loan signs from LSF-SR, the [[French Sign Language]] dialect of the [[Suisse Romande]], and less from the DGS.&lt;ref name="HfH" /&gt;

== Literature ==
Two books have been published in [[SignWriting]].&lt;ref name="HfH" /&gt;

'''The People's Army Model''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''מודל צבא העם''') is a [[school of thought]] in Israel concerning the role of the Israeli Army, the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], vis-à-vis Israeli society. According to this conception, the IDF plays a broader role than merely defending Israel's national security. It also has a social role in implementing the country's [[melting pot]] policy, through integrating all sectors of Israeli society into its units. Israel's [[regular army]] is relatively small, and thus its strength in emergency is based on [[reservists]], which comprise much of the entire nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUHe&amp;BaseHref=DAV/1950/10/15&amp;EntityId=Ar00102&amp;ViewMode=HTML] [http://jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUHe&amp;BaseHref=DAV/1951/11/25&amp;EntityId=Ar00121&amp;ViewMode=HTML]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Suez Crisis]], the Israeli newspaper ''[[Davar]]'' published the following: "Our army is, as is well known, the people's army, an army of reserves, the laborer and the clerk, [as] the laborer and the teacher had one day laid down their daily work and stabilized the flag".&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUHe&amp;BaseHref=DAV/1956/12/07&amp;EntityId=Ar00302&amp;ViewMode=HTML]&lt;/ref&gt; It is from this premise that the view that the school is called to the training of youth to be the "people's army", by providing uniform education, was derived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUHe&amp;BaseHref=DAV/1949/04/03&amp;EntityId=Ar00207&amp;ViewMode=HTML]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wahinda''' tribe of Eastern Africa, are mentioned in Richard Francis Burton's The Lake Regions of Central Africa: A Picture of Exploration, Vol. 2., P. 219.

..."Of the tribes dwelling about the [[Nyanaz]], ... Remain the Wahinda, a clan or class alluded to in this and a former chapter...

The Wahninda (in the singular [[Muhinda]]) are, according to some Arabs, a foreign and ruling family, who coming from a distant country, probably in the neighbourhood of [[Somaliland]], conquered the lands, and became Sultans. This opinion seems to rest upon physical peculiarities – the superiority of the Wahinda in figure, stature, and complexion to their subjects suggesting a difference of origin.  Others explain the word Muhinda to mean a cadet of royal family, and call the class Bayt el Saltanah, or the Kingly House.  ...

The Wahinda are found in the regions of Usui, Karagwah, Uhha, Uvinza, Uyungu, Ujiji, and Urundi, where they live in [[boma (enclosure)|boma]] -- stockades—and scattered villages. Of this race are the Sultans Suwarora of the Wasui, Armanika of Karagway, Kanoni of Uhha, Kanze of Uyungu, Mzogera of Uvinza, Rusimba of Ujiji, Mwezi of Urundi, Mnyamurunde of Uyofo, Gaetawa of Uhayya, and Mutawazi of Utumbara. The Wahinda affect a milk diet which is exceedingly fattening, and anoint themselves plentifully with butter and [[ghee]], to soften and polish the skin. They never sell [i.e. enslave] their fellow clansmen, are hospitable and civil to strangers, seldom carry arms, fear nothing from the people, and may not be slain even in battle. There the Wahinda reigh, their ministers are the [[Watosi]], a race which has been described when treating of their headquarters [[Karagwah]]."

Under [[Musical Instruments]] - Drums this reference was found:

One East African tribe, the Wahinda, believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be fatal to any person other than the sultan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sachs, Curt]] (1940), The History of Musical Instruments, Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference to the Wahinda in relationship to drums and drumming comes from a ''Sacred Beat: from the heart of the drum circle'', by Telesco and Waterhawk &lt;ref&gt;Sacred beat: from the heart of the drum circle. Telesco, Patricia  and Don Two Eagles Waterhawk, Time's Beat: a Brief History of Drums, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

...[T]here is one "myth" about the drum that needs to be clarified. Many people think of the drum as a man's tool. However, the histories of Egyptian, Semitic, Sumerain, and Wahinda people all tell us of women using these instruments. ... [A]mong the Wahinda of East Africa, it's considered a death wish for a man to even ''look'' at a drum. They will only dare to carry it at night, and even better during the dark moon so it cannot be seen. ...

Today, the Muhinda seem to inhabit parts of [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], and [[Rwanda]], at the very least. (according to whom)

The late [[Sam Magara]], a Ugandan military leader was from the Muhinda clan of the Bahima.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.observer.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4535&amp;Itemid=59, accessed: 3 Oct 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, the princes of [[Unyoro]] are called Wawitu, and point to the north when asked where their country [[Uwitu]] is situated, doubtfully saying, when questioned about its distance, "How can we tell circumstances which took place in our forefathers' times? we only think it is somewhere near your country." Although, however, this very interesting people, the [[Wahuma]], delight in supposing themselves to be of European origin, they are forced to confess, on closer examination, that although they came in the first instance from the doubtful north, they came latterly from the east, as part of a powerful tribe, beyond [[Kidi]], who excel in arms, and are so fierce no Kidi people, terrible in war as these too are described to be, can stand against them. This points, if our maps are true, to the [[Oromo people|Gallas]] — for all pastorals in these people's minds are Wahuma; and if we could only reconcile ourselves to the belief that the Wawitu derived their name from Omwita, the last place they attacked on the east coast of Africa, then all would be clear: for it must be noticed the Wakama, or kings, when asked to what race they owe their origin, invariably reply, in the first place, from princes—giving, for instance, the titles Wawitu in [[Unyoro]], and Wahinda in [[Karague]] — which is most likely caused by their never having been asked such a close question before, whilst the idiom of the language generally induces them to call themselves after the name applied to their country.&lt;ref&gt;The Discover of the Source of the Nile. [[John Hanning Speke]], Chapter IX.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22388">[[Image:Folketeaterbygningen, Oslo.jpg|thumb|The head office of the [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Workers' Youth League]] in Oslo]]

The '''Workers' Youth League affair''' was a political affair, where leaders of the [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Workers' Youth League]] (AUF) were charged with deliberately inflating membership numbers to receive increased government funding. Two former treasurers and two former leaders of the [[Oslo]] chapter were found guilty of fraud, and given prison sentences, for having unlawfully received {{NOK|648,000}} in grants from the City of Oslo between 1992 and 1994. The convicted were [[Ragnar Bøe Elgsaas]], [[Anders Hornslien]], [[Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen]] and [[Anders Greif Mathisen]]. Anders Mathisen's sentence was suspended.

==Background==
On 2 March 1995, the newspaper ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' revealed that AUF's [[Oslo]] branch had artificially inflated their membership numbers from 1992 to 1994, and as a result received NOK 600,000 more than they were entitled to in government grants. For each new member recruited, AUF received nearly NOK 300 from the [[Oslo City Council]]. The yearly membership fee was at the time NOK 30.&lt;ref name="VGPUBLISHING"&gt;{{cite news |title=Prisavisen|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=220139 |work=Verdens Gang |date=21 March 2004 |language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PARTIII"/&gt;

[[Image:Oslo CityHall01.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The City of Oslo was the subject of the fraud]] 
The scam was accomplished by transferring money from AUF's main bank account into AUF-treasurer Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen's private bank account, from which he then transferred money back into AUF’s account to pay for new members.&lt;ref name="VGPUBLISHING"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PARTIII"/&gt; By doing this, AUF's membership was inflated by 2,300 between 1992 and 1994, AUF obtained more than NOK 600.000 from government funds.&lt;ref name="VGPUBLISHING"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PARTIII"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JAIL"/&gt;

==Investigation==
On 7 March 1995, five days after the case became public the [[Oslo administration]] started an investigation into the matter. On 11 March, the leader of Oslo AUF, [[Ragnar Bøe Elgsaas]], submitted a report to the City Council, in which he admitted to inflating the membership numbers submitted to city, and that they had later received increased grants based upon these incorrect numbers. In his report, Elgsaas referred to this practice as 'advancing' money to pay for membership fees for people whom AUF had reason to believe wanted to become members, or renew their memberships with the party. The same day as he pleaded guilty, he resigned from his position as leader of Oslo AUF.&lt;ref name="JAIL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PARTII"/&gt;

On 14 March, former leaders of AUF, [[Jens Stoltenberg]], the Deputy Leader of the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] at that time, and Turid Birkeland, admitted that the lying about AUF's total membership to pay for membership fees had become a common and accepted practice.&lt;ref name="JAIL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PARTI"&gt;{{cite news |title=Alvorlig tiltale om grovt bedrageri|url=http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d28635.htm |work=Aftenposten |date=5 January 1998 |author=Andreas Arneseth |language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March, the police started a formal criminal investigation of AUF's Oslo chapter.&lt;ref name="PARTII"/&gt; The Treasurer Office of the Oslo administration concluded on 20 May that AUF Oslo had wrongfully received NOK 600,000 in government grants and NOK 48,000 in seminar subsidies.&lt;ref name="PARTIII"&gt;{{cite news |title=AUF-saken: Et kjempesvik mot tillit|url=http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d31100.htm |work=Aftenposten |date=30 January 1998 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 May 2012 |archivedate=12 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67bxdjuT2 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 1996, [[Minister of Transport and Communications (Norway)|Minister of Transport and Communications]], [[Kjell Opseth]] of the Norwegian Labour Party, submitted a formal complaint to the police, in which he accused 24 other youth organisations of fraud. The accusations were divided into four different categories, which meant that there was a statute of limitations attached to some of the charges. This resulted in the acquittal of [[Thorbjørn Jagland]] (then leader of the Norwegian Labour Party) and Stoltenberg. This led to an angry outcry from the opposition parties. On 16 February, several lawyers, among them Juror Dr. Johs. Andenæs, stated that they had reacted strongly upon what they saw as the Labour Party's interference in an attempt to exempt AUF from the criminal investigation.&lt;ref name="PARTII"/&gt;

On 1 April 1996, formal charges were made against former treasurer Røberg Larsen, former leader Elgsaas, former leader [[Anders Hornslien]] and former treasurer [[Anders Greif Mathisen]] by prosecutor [[Harald Strand]]. On 4 June, the [[Norwegian Young Conservatives|Oslo Young Conservatives]] and the [[Youth of the Progress Party (Norway)|Oslo's Progress Party's Youth]] were forced to pay back NOK 70,000 to the city. On 29 October, the police dismissed the fraud cases against the other 22 youth organisations.&lt;ref name="PARTII"&gt;{{cite news |title=Maraton-strid om penger og politikk|url=http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d28329.htm |work=Aftenposten |date=30 December 1997 |author=Olav Trygge Storvik |language=Norwegian |accessdate=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court case and charges==
[[Image:Oslo tinghus.jpg|thumb|[[Oslo District Court]]]]

The scandal was processed by the [[Oslo District Court]] between January and March, 1998. The court was led by Judge Torjus Gard, while the head prosecutor was Atle Roaldsøy. Defendant for Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen was [[Tor Erling Staff]], while Anders Hornslien was defended by Sigurd Klomsæt,&lt;ref name="HORNSLIEN"/&gt; Mathisen's defender was Erik Nadheim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iskald hilsen til AUF-kamerater |url= |work=Dagbladet |agency= |date=30 January 1998 |author=Kari Westengen |language=Norwegian |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treasurer and leader of AUF Oslo between 1992 to 1994 were charged with [[fraud]]. In 1992, AUF received NOK 283,000 too much in grants, the following year NOK 210,000 too much, and in 1994, NOK 120,000. Larsen and Elgsaas were both charged for all three incidents, while Hornslien was only charged for the first, while Mathisen was charged for the two last. Larsen was also charged with [[embezzlement]] of NOK 78,000.&lt;ref name="PARTI"/&gt; All four pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Erkjente seg ikke skyldig i AUF-saken |url= |work= |agency=Norwegian News Agency |date=5 January 1998 |author=Kari Westengen |language=Norwegian |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City's statement===
Borghild Heddal, responsible for the municipal's grants to youth organisations, stated that there was no room for [[crime]]. Heddal, after the investigation, said: "The City of Oslo helped these organisations. But they decided to go behind our backs and continue with something that is unheard of." She described the actions as a "betrayal of trust". The rules for the grants were sent out once per year; in addition, there was an annual seminar where these youth organisations were informed about the procedures, and she could confirm that AUF always participated on such events. Heddal pointed out that the rules were clear, and that there were no excuse to be found. She specifically mentioned that if a person chooses to not pay a membership for a given year, it would judicially be a statement that they no longer wanted to be considered members. She also commented that the rules stated that the membership had to be paid within the end of the year. After Newyears, it would not be possible to pay for membership the previous year.&lt;ref name="PARTIII"/&gt;

===Hornslien's statement===
[[Anders Hornslien]], leader of Oslo AUF from 1991 and 1993, claimed he had nothing to do with the accounts of the organisation. He stated: "I never approved such activities, and i've never supported the inflation of membership numbers." He also denied that there were made lists of such people, which were used to apply for municipal grants. He admitted that he had paid a pile of 100 [[Bankgiro|giros]], he did not believe it to be suspicious however. "We only paid contingents for those who had expressed that they wanted to be members of AUF, or for those whom we had reason to believe wanted to be members". He expressed, when questioned, that there was not enough time to get the money back from the people who had confirmed by telephone, since the organisation was in the middle of organising its annual congress. Those who actually did pay, were signed up as paying members the following year.&lt;ref name="HORNSLIEN"&gt;{{cite news |title= Hornslien fra skanse til skanse|url=http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d29411.htm |work=Aftenposten |date=13 January 1998 |author=Tor Arne Andreassen |language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornslien stated in court that two former AUF leaders, [[Trond Giske]] and [[Turid Birkeland]], pressured AUF Oslo to keep up the artificially high membership numbers. He also stated that it was pride, rather than money, that was the motivating factors for him. He continued, by telling the court that AUF Oslo was contacted on a yearly basis by the central leadership of the Labour Party, if the Labour Party leadership felt the membership was to low AUF was told to shape up.&lt;ref name="HORNSLIEN"/&gt;

Hornslien was eventually charged and convicted of inflating membership numbers and the unlawful appropriation of NOK 200,000 in grants. He struggled to convince the court that the main reason for paying NOK 21,000 in membership fees was ''not'' to receive NOK 210.000 in grants.&lt;ref name="HORNSLIEN"/&gt;

===Elgsaas' statement===
[[Ragnar Bøe Elgsaas]] admitted having 'advanced' membership fees for people he had not asked if they wanted to be members. Each December, the board would phone people to ask them if they wanted to renew their membership. If they said yes, they would receive a giro in the mail. Elgsaas gave himself away, when stating "if this was not the case, we would 'advance' for the member". Elgsaas later denied stating this. Of the 700 people who had been incorrectly registered as members, Elgsaas estimated that they had phoned about half of them. They used several rules of thumb to consider who wanted to be members, without actually asking them, including those who applied for membership during the year, those who had formerly had positions, those who had been to information meetings, and those whom they knew personally. He also confirmed it was impossible to recollect the NOK 30 that was advanced, because the information of who had confirmed was automatically deleted from the computer system.&lt;ref name="ELGSAAS"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hundrevis i AUF uten samtykke|url=http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d29818.htm |work=Aftenposten |date= 16 January 1998 |author=Tor Arne Andreassen |language=Norwegian|accessdate=6 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution showed video evidence from a post office in the city center, where Elgaas was seen paying for the massive amount of giros. Included in this pile, was one for a woman who had reported AUF to the police in 1995, after she had attempted to leave the organisation nine times. Elgass had stated that he did not 'advance' for people who did not want to be members of the party. When questioned about the woman, he said that it could happen that they 'advanced' for the wrong person. The police had also found Elgsaas' mother's name on two of the giros. Elgsaas explained that he experienced pressure from the leader of AUF, [[Trond Giske]], and the general secretary, [[Rita Ottervik]], to continue with the 'advancements'.&lt;ref name="ELGSAASVG"&gt;{{cite news |title=AUF-saken: Bildebevis fremlagt|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=416 |work=Verdens Gang |date=19 January 1998 |author= |language=Norwegian|accessdate=6 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rødberg Larsen's statement===
[[Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen]], treasurer of Oslo AUF from 1992 to 1994, had at first denied to testify in the case, after advice from his defense attorney, but chose to change his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Røberg-Larsen nekter å forklare seg etter råd fra Staff  |work= |agency=Norwegian News Agency |date=8 January 1998 |author=Kari Westengen |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the court that the Oslo Labour Party pressured the Oslo AUF to maintain high membership numbers, in order to maintain their strong influence within AUF. He also told the court that the four accused members tried to keep the money advancements a secret, because they all knew that the practice was illegal. He also admitted that the leadership of AUF in the years between 1992 and 1994 conspired to inflate membership numbers in order to receive higher government subsidies. The leadership regularly paid membership fees for those members who did not pay their fees. In 1993, they also decided to pay membership fees for people who had never expressed any desire to be members of AUF. He also admitted that the four of them met at Hornslien's parliament office to discuss the situation after ''Verdens Gang'' broke the story.&lt;ref name="JAIL"/&gt;

Unlike the other three indicted, Rødberg Larsen was also charged with embezzlement of money from several of the small, inactive chapters in Oslo. Elgsaas and Mathisen had stated that they had spent NOK 30,000 and NOK 11,000 each to 'advance' the membership fees, and had both stated that they had done this without believing they would be repaid the money. They also lent NOK 38,000 and NOK 18,000 to Rødberg Larsen to cover the deficit in the Oslo chapter. Rødberg Larsen claimed that it was Elgsaas and Mathisen that had emptied the inactive accounts, to cover their costs for the 'advancements'. He further claimed that he had only borrowed NOK 12–13,000 from Elgaas, and nothing from Mathisen. He claimed the deficit was something that Elgaas and Mathisen had imagined afterwards. When questioned about where the money from the inactive chapters had gone, Rødberg Larsen claimed that they had been used to start new chapters. When questioned about why there were no receipts for this, he stated the all the receipts had either not been kept, or been stolen in a framed theft.&lt;ref name="RODBERG"&gt;{{cite news |title=- Delte penger med to av de medtiltalte |url=http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d30708.htm |work=Aftenposten |date=27 January 1998 |author=Tor Arne Andreassen |language=Norwegian |accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rødberg Larsen made several statements which directly opposed those made by the other three indicted. He claimed the local chapters had been deliberately misled by the leadership in Oslo AUF. He also stated that the motivation to keep the membership numbers high, was to avoid that former leaders, who had become central in the Oslo Labour Party, would be discredited. He also felt that 120–130 people on "Bjørn Jarle's superlist" were people form whom 'advancements' were being made, but who they had no reason to believe actually wanted to be members of AUF. He also stated that the reason Mathisen was recruited from [[Akershus]] AUF, was that "he could be trusted regarding 'advancements'".&lt;ref name="RODBERG" /&gt;

=== Stoltenberg's involvement ===
On 14 March 1995, twelve days after ''Verdens Gang'' published the story, [[Jens Stoltenberg]] and former leader of AUF, Turid Birkeland, admitted that 'advancing' money to pay for membership fees was a common and accepted practice at the time they were involved with the organisation.&lt;ref name="STOLTENBERG"/&gt;

[[File:Jens Stoltenberg NHO 2009 04.jpg|thumb|left|Jens Stoltenberg, since 2005 Prime Minister of Norway]]
However, on 17 March 1998, Stoltenberg was called to give testimony in the case.&lt;ref name="STOLTENBERG"/&gt; He told the Oslo District Court, under oath, that he was unfamiliar with the artificial inflating of membership figures which took place in the AUF.&lt;ref name="STOLTENBERG"/&gt; He also told the court that he was unaware of any form of fraud taking place in the organisation under his leadership, and stated that he had never heard of 'advancing' money to pay for memberships until ''Verdens Gang'' broke the story on 2 March 1995.&lt;ref name="STOLTENBERG"/&gt; He also stated that in his opinion, it was not necessarily wrong to 'advance' money for members, provided that the members in question reimbursed this fee later on.&lt;ref name="STOLTENBERG"/&gt;

Stoltenberg was also cross-examined by defence lawyer Tor Erling Staff, who pointed out that membership numbers for AUF during Stoltenbergs tenure, 11,000, were too high.&lt;ref name="STOLTENBERG"/&gt; According to Staff's calculations, such a huge membership numbers would mean that AUF had to recruit several thousand members each year.&lt;ref name="STOLTENBERG"/&gt; The following day, Jens Stoltenberg told the court that the government had accepted non-paying members in youth organisations as normal members for many years, provided that the membership was confirmed by [[word of mouth]] by the member in question.&lt;ref name="STOLTENBERG"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stoltenberg: staten godtok "juks" |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/1998/03/18/71436.html |work=Dagbladet |date=18 March 1998 |author=Kari Westengen |language=Norwegian |accessdate=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jagland's involvement ===
[[File:Thorbjorn Jagland 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Thorbjørn Jagland, former [[Prime Minister of Norway]] (1996–97)]]
When [[Thorbjørn Jagland]] gave evidence in the case, he agreed with Stoltenberg that it was not necessarily wrong to 'advance' money for memberships, provided that the members in question reimbursed this fee later on.&lt;ref name="JAGLAND"/&gt; He did, however, tell the court that it was unacceptable to transfer money from AUF's main bank account to pay for membership fees.&lt;ref name="JAGLAND"/&gt; He also agreed, when pressed by the prosecutor, that membership numbers were too high when he was the leader.&lt;ref name="JAGLAND"/&gt; In his defense he stated that if AUF were to follow the law too rigidly, they would only have ended up with a quarter of the membership numbers that the [[Norwegian Young Conservatives|Young Conservatives]] operated with.&lt;ref name="JAGLAND"/&gt; He said that it would have been absurd to follow the law to the letter.&lt;ref name="JAGLAND"/&gt;

He also told the court that AUF should have received even more subsidie, referring to some of the other political youth parties that used similar methods for calculating membership numbers.&lt;ref name="JAGLAND"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jagland innrømmet medlems-triksing |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/1998/03/17/70965.html |work=Dagbladet |date=17 March 1998  |author=Unn Conradi Andersen |language=Norwegian |accessdate=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other involved former members ===
[[Turid Birkeland]] and Øystein Mæland, both AUF board members during Jens Stoltenberg's time as AUF leader, admitted that there had been a culture of inflating membership numbers in the organisation at the time. Stoltenberg denied any knowledge of this.&lt;ref name="STOLTENBERG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JAGLAND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OTHERS"/&gt; [[Erik Solheim]], former leader of [[Socialist Youth (Norway)|Socialist Youth]], admitted that also other youth parties had inflated membership numbers.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ikke ny behandling av AUF-saken |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/1998/07/30/126401.html |work=Dagbladet |date=30 July 1998 |author= |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 May 2012 |archivedate=12 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67bw9k61D |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former AUF leader, [[Anniken Huitfeldt]], also admitted that membership numbers were too high.&lt;ref name="OTHERS"/&gt; She told the court that the reason why AUF decided to keep up the practice of during her leadership, was to protect former members of the organisation who had contributed to this inflation.&lt;ref name="OTHERS"/&gt; She also admitted that she was taught how to 'advance' money for membership fees when she first joined the organisation.&lt;ref name="OTHERS"/&gt; Øystein Mæland eventually cancelled his membership with the Labour Party because he felt that the four members sentenced for their involvement in the fraud were used as scapegoats.&lt;ref name="OTHERS"&gt;{{cite news |title=Huitfeldt innrømmet oppblåste medlemstall |url=http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d35301.htm |work=Aftenposten |date=13 March 1998 |author=Lise Merete Olaussen |language=Norwegian |accessdate=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Verdict ==
All four charged were convicted of fraud on 21 March 1998. In all major matters, the prosecutors submission of evidence was supported by the judge. The court felt that the fraud was the result of a planned work, and had been ongoing for several years. The court did not believe that the organisation did not have financial motives for the fraud. The court also stated that an organisation culture was not [[mitigating circumstances]]. It also stated that the leaders and treasurers had a personal responsibility.
